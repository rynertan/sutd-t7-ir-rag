# Crop engaging devices, apparatus and methods.

## Abstract
A crop engaging device for conveying and or treating crop comprises a support 8 and a plurality of crop engaging elements 10 extending outwardly from the base. The device may be a stationary array of elements 9 protruding into a crop flow 5 , or a rotor 11,12 which may be driven to convey or retard crop, or may be freely rotating. The crop engaging elements may be outwardly extending fins 24 , or transversely extending ribs 22 , or discs 21 perpendicular to the axis of rotation. The crop engaging elements 10 may have specified yielding characterisics, being yieldable in a preferred direction and being yieldable predominantly at a region spaced from the outer tip. Each fin 24 may be inclined relative to the direction of crop flow to impart lateral movement to the crop. Two cooperating rotors 11,12 may have crop engaging elements 10,19,21 which intermesh so that ribs 23 or discs 21 on one rotor 12 press crop onto sharp tips of brushes 19 or fins 24 on the other rotor 11 to condition the crop. Transverse ribs 131,200 may be radially sprung to avoid damage. Outwardly extending fins 24 may have reclined, stepped profiles 36 to improve crop engagement and release.
