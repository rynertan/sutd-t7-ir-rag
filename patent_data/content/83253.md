# LIQUID CRYSTAL OPTICAL PRINTING APPARATUS

## Abstract
A liquid crystal optical printing apparatus comprising a light source k , a liquid crystal panel a which is arranged to be irradiated with light which is emitted from said light source k and which is provided with a plurality of light valves a 1 , and means b for selectively opening and closing said light valves a 1 characterised in that the liquid crystal panel a is provided with nematic liquid crystal material whose dielectic anisotropy can be inverted in dependence upon the frequency, the driver means b being arranged to drive said liquid crystal panel a at higher and lower frequencies respectively to control the orientation of the molecules of the liquid crystal material so as to control the transmission and blocking of light through the liquid crystal panel a .
