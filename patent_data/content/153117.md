# Preparation of free flowing particulate yeast.

## Abstract
Baker s yeast, having a moisture content of from about 65 to about 75 percent by weight, is provided in a free flowing particulate form by dispersing throughout a particulate baker s yeast, having a moisture content of from about 65 to 75 per cent by weight, a small but effective amount of a finely divided insoluble salt of an alkaline earth metal, particularly a calcium or magnesium salt. The resultant baker s yeast exhibits in creased flowability and is retained in free flowing particulate form for extended periods of time under a variety of conditions. As compared to baker s yeast which has not been treated with the alkaline earth metal salt, the treated baker s yeast exhibits no loss in leavening activity.
