# AC generator directly coupled with internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
An AC generator for internal combustion engines comprises a stator including an armature core 10 , a generator coil 28 and an output terminal 24 connected to an end of the coil a rotor fitted on the forward end of a crankshaft 2 and including a boss 4 secured by a mounting screw 9 axially at the end of the crankshaft, nail shaped magnetic poles 5, 6 pressure fitted on the boss, and a field coil 7 arranged in the space formed by the nail shaped magnetic poles and the boss a collector device including a first collector conductor 42 electri cally connected to an end of the field coil and a second collector conductor 18 electrically connected to the other end of the field coil and a first brush in sliding contact with the first collector conductor and a second brush 22 in sliding contact with the second collector conductor. The first collector conductor is arranged substan tially at the central part of the rotor and the second col lector coductor is an annular conductor arranged along a circumference of a predetermined radius from the center of the rotor.
