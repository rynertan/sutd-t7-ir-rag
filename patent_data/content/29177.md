## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention This invention relates to digital peripheral equipment controllers and more specifically to intelligent controllers for relieving the central processor with which the peripheral equipment communicates, of certain processing functions.Description of the Prior Art Most present date peripheral controllers are designed to control I O data transfers. No data manipulation is performed on the data stream as it is transferred between the central processor and the peripheral digital device. The preferred embodiment of this invention involves seismic data processing. In prior art seismic data processors, data moving between the central processor and, for example its tape sub system, are transferred in a memory image form, in the same format as they were recorded in the field. Unfortunately, field recorded data is not optimized for manipulation by the typical office processing system.In the present state of the art, it is estimated that there are approximately 200 seismic field formats and with the present date peripheral controllers, the central processor is required to transform any of those field formats to a blocked demultiplexed format of a relatively short record and with numerical representations that are either 16 to 32 bit six point integers, or 32 to 40 bit floating point values. A state of the art solution has been to increase the power of the central processor and the speed and size of its central memory. However, this solution tends to be expensive, requiring an extensive hardware and software effort. Also, in view of the fact that seismic data collection is increasing at an exponential rate, this solution is not long term. This invention provides a viable alternative, reducing the burden placed on the central processor by shifting some of the processing burdens onto intelligent peripheral controllers. This relieves the central processor of the need to execute common tasks, such as scan detection, scan lengths error correction, true amplitude recovery, format conversions, data scaling limiting, and channel demultiplexing.BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The intelligent controller of this preferred embodiment communicates with a Central Processing Unit CPU and, in this preferred embodiment, a maximum of 16 magnetic tape transports. The transport densities tnay be of the 800 bit per inch 3PI variety, 1600 BPI or 6250 BPI in non return to zero, phase encoding and group encoding respectively. In the preferred embodiment, seismic data in any one of over 200 field formats is recorded on the magnetic tapes. the intelligent processor is comprised of three sections the command processor, the device interface controller and the process sequence controller. The command processor interfaces with the CPU, receiving commands which are decoded and sent to the device interface controller and to the process sequence controller. The command processor has an activation controller which monitors information from the CPU to determine whether a command has been issued. The activation controller, upon detecting a command, determines whether that command requires fetching a command list block t ically eight words ron. the central memory of the CPU or whether it is a single command word that can be directly sent to the appropriate component of the intelligent controller. If a command list block is required, the activation controller causes the list fetch controller, another component of the command processor, to fetch the command list block which is then stored in the list buffer, in either the output or input section as determined by the list fetch controller.A list interpret controller takes a command list block from the list buffer, interprets it and sends it to the device interface section in the process sequence controller. The device interface has a system read controller which accepts commands from the list interpret controller and controls a data read controller which in turn, through a formatter selector switch, controls a tape formatter. Also included in the device interface is a write sequence controller which responds to controls from the list interpret controller and a tape write controller which in turn, through the formatter selector switch, controls the writing on the tape through a formatter. The process sequence controller responds to commands from the list interpret controller, and takes incoming data from the data read controller for processing and transmission to the central memory Its function is to process data as commanded. For example, raw data coming from the data read controller may be changed to an IBM floating pointDlock format and then sent to the central memory. The device interface section is seen to have an input and output section which are capable of operating independently.That is, while information is being read in from tape, information can be written onto another tape. The primary object of this invention is to process seismic data on the fly prior to storing in central memory of a CPU. Another object of this invention is to provide an intelligent controller that can read and write simultaneously. These and other objects will be made obvious in the detailed description that follows BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. la lb is a block diagram of the intelligent controller FIGURE 2 is a schematic diagram of the circuitry for providing various clock signals.

The system 10 communicates with the central memory of a computer such as the TI980B, in this preferred embodiment, by way of a direct memory access intervace DMAIF 11 and Store Fetch Controller 12. It will be evident that there are six users of the central memory requiring inputs Cycle Requests . CYREQ and Interrupt Requests INTREQ . The Process Sequence Controller PSC 28 has one input Data.Mmory Access Go DMAGO to and receives one output Data Memory AccessRequested DMAREQ from Store Fetch Controller 12, the memory accessing for PSC 28 being different from the other memory users. The Store Fetch Controller 12 provides outputs CycleGranted CYGkN , Interrupt Recognized INTRECOG and Data Available DATAV to the memory users. Store FetchController 12 provides a Store Fetch signal and an IREQ signal to DMAIS 11, receiving from the OMAIF 11 the DATAV signal, theIRECOG signal and an Acknowledgment Granted AG signal. Memory Read Data Bus MRB 35, Memory Write Data Bus MWD 37, and Memory Address Bus MAD 39 are connected to DMAiF 11. Activation Controller ACT 13 is connected to receiveATI strobes to be described later from DMAlFll and is also connected to receive words from the memory via MRD and to write words into memory via MWD at the proper address by selection through MAD. ACT 13 is connected bilaterally to List FetchController LFC 14 which is connected to read and write into the central memory. ACT 13, depending upon instructions it receives, will cause LFC 14 to fetch a list of commands from the central memory or will directly communicate with the device interface section described later of the intelligent controller 10. List Buffer Address Register 16 is addressed by LFC 14 and by List Interrupt Controller LIC 15 . LFC 14 loads list Buffer 17 at the addresses specified in List BufferAddress Register 16 with command lists for use by the device interface section or by PSC 28 described later . LFC 14 determines whether a particular command list is for use by theDevice Interface Section or by PSC 28 and places such lists in List Buffer 17 in a section designated for use by the DeviceInterface or in a section designated for use by PSC 28. LIC 15 continuously monitors the device interface section and PSC 28 to determine whether those sections are demanding action. LIC 15 also continuously monitors the con4 tents of list buffer 17 to determine whether there are any command lists therein for either PSC 28 or the device interface section. LIC 15 is a user of central memory for purposes of reporting status as is described below. ACT 13, LFC 14, LIC 15, List Buffer Address Register 16 and List Buffer 17 make up the command processor section of the intelligent controller 10. DMA1F 11 and Store FetchController 12 are, in this preferred embodiment, incorporated on the command processor circuit board. The Write Sequence Controller WSC 26, the TapeWrite Controller TWC 29, the System Read Controller SRC 27, the Data Read Controller DRC 30 and the Formatter SelectorSwitch 31 are the major components of the data interface section and are all mounted on a common circuit board. System ReadController Level 1 SRC LVL 1 register 19 is connected to LIC 15 and to SRC 27 and functions as a very fast access storage register for command lists transferred from List suffer 17 by LIC 15. Register 19, in this preferred embodiment, is a random access memory manufactured by Texas InstrumentsIncorporated, Type SN74S208 controlled as a first in, firstout FIFO register.This random access memory could,of course, De accused in any random fashion desired other than as a FIFO In a similar manner, WSC LVL 1 register 18 is connected between LIC 15 and WSC 26 and is identical to and performs the same function as register 19. Status FIFO s 22 and 23 are connected between LIC 15 and WSC 26 and SRC 27, respectively. Status is sent to LIC 15 so that there is no unnecessary interruption of the data flow either to or from the device interface section. Flip flop 21 is connected between LIC 15 and WSC 26 and indicates that register 18 is full or not full. Likewise, flip flop 24, connected betweenLIC 15 and SRC 27 indicates whether register 19 is full or empty. If register 18 is full, then WSC 26 is able to. have its contents transferred.In the same manner, if flip flop 24 indicates that register 19 is full, then the SRC can accept the information from register 19. RSC 26 and SRC 27, as memory users, have connections to the MRD, MWD and MAD buses.The Tape Write Controller TWC 29 is bilaterally connected to CSC 26 and is further connected to FormatterSelector Switch 31. The Data Read Controller DRC 30 is bilaterally connected to SRC 27 and is bilaterally connected to the Formatter Selector Switch 31. DRC 30 also is connected to PSC 28 to transmit data pNassiRg through Formatter SelectorSwitch 31 and through DRC 30. Formatter Selector Switch 31 has formatter A 32 and Formatter B 33 connected to it. These formatters are not part of the intelligent controller and in this preferred embodiment, as accessories, are supplied by the Telex Corporation and are series 6800. Each is capable of handling eight tape transports. The tape transports are not shown, but could be connected to each of the eight lines shown from Formatter A 32 and Formatter B 33. WSC 26 communicates through Formatter SelectorSwitch 31 with Formatter A32 and Formatter B33 as determined by the command word from WSC LVL 1 register 18. When a particular write instruction is received, WSC 26 fetches data from the central memory, transfers it to TWC 29 which in turn transfers the data through Formatter Selector Switch 31 to the selected Formatter 32 or 33 for writing on tape. WSC 26, while such writing of data is occurring, continuously monitors the formatters for any status signals which are transmitted to status FIFO 22 which in turn transmits the status to LIC 15 which sends such status to the central memory. If necessary, the CPU can then take action. SRC 27 operates in much the same fashion asWSC 26. That is, a command is taken in from register 19, SRC 27 through Formatter Selector Switch 31 selects a tape onFormatter 32 or Formatter 33 from which to read as determined by the instruction sent from register 19. Data is read from the tapes into DRC 30 which can recognize scan codes and then to PSC 28. While such reading operation is going on,SRC 27 monitors Formatter 32 and Formatter 33 for status, sending any such status to status FIFO 23, which then sends the status to LIC 15 which in turn transmits it to the central memory. If action is warranted, the CPU will take action. PSC 28 is the third section of intelligent controller 10. Similar to SRC 27 and WSC 26, PSC 28 has a level 1 register known as Process Sequence Controller Level 1 SCLVL 1 register 20 connected between itself and LIC 15. Register 20 receives commands from LIC 15 for action by PSC 28. Flip flop 25 operates in the same fashion as flip flops 21 and 24. Flip flop 25 is connected to LIC 15 and indicates whether register 20 is empty or fullIf it is full, then the commands therein may be transferred to PSC 28. PSC 28 has connection to the central memory through buses MRD, MWD and MAD. Also, PSC 28 has a connection from the Store Fetch Controller on the lineDMAREQ and has a connection to controller 12 through lineDMA GO. Refer now to Figures 2 and 3. Circuitry for development of clock pulses and the developed pulses, respectively, are depicted. It should be noted that inverse or not functions are designated by a dash following the identifier. Also, Q following the identifier generally indicates a flip flop output. The input clock from the TI 980B computer is applied on terminal T092, carried on line 55 and inverted through inverter 53, being applied as the clock input to flip flop 54. voltage vCC is applied, through resistor R1, to line 55 which is connected through resistor R2 to ground. The voltage waveform A applied to the clock input of flip flop 54 is shown as waveform A CLR4MHZ , with time tl t4 being 167 nanoseconds and time t4 t6 being 83 nanoseconds in the preferred embodiment, providing a total period of 250 nanoseconds and therefore a frequency of 4 MHz. As connected, flip flop 54 triggers each time that waveform A goes positive. Therefore, the Q output of flip flop 54 is one half the frequency of waveform A and is shown in Figure 3 as waveform B CLK2.MHZ . Waveform 3 is applied as one input to exclusive OR circuit 45 and also as an input to delay line 42.Delay line 42 provides an output waveform C TAP60 which is waveform 3 delayed 62.5 nanoseconds.waveform C serves as the otherinput to exclusive OR circuit 45 whose output is waveform F CLXXORA . Note that waveformF results from the condition that waveform B equals 1 while waveform C equals 0 or that waveform B equals 0 while waveform C equals 1 . The last tap on delay line 42 is connected as an input to delay line 41 which has an output waveform D TAP120 which is waveform 3 delayed approximately 125 nanoseconds, applied as an input to exclusive OR circuit 43. Delay line 41 has a second, later output waveform E TAP180 which is waveform B delayed approximately 187.5 nanoseconds, applied as the other Input to exclusive OR circuit 43 whose output is waveform G CLKXORB . Note that waveform G is identical to waveform F, simply delayed.Also note that waveform G results from the condition that waveform D equals 1 , while waveform E equals o or that waveform D equals 0 while waveform E equals 1 . Wavesorms F and G are applied as inputs to exclusive OR circuit 46 whose output is waveform H cLK8MBZ . Waveform n is a result of the condition that waveform F equals 1 while waveform G equals O or that waveform F equals tio n while waveform G equals 1 . WaveformH is inverted through inverter 48 whose output is CLKTPCX2 and applied to terminal B45.Waveform H is also inverted through inverter 43 whose output is identified as CLX8X300 applied to output Sll. Waveform F is amplified through amplifier 51 providing output signal CLXTPC applied to terminal B47. Waveform F is also inverted through inverter 52 providing signal CLKTPC applied to terminal B48. These clocks are used as clock inputs for the various circuits to be described.Store Fetch Controller and DAMIF Figures 4a and b schematically illustrate The store etch controller 12 which functions as a memory expander for the central memory. That is, it permits direct access to the central memory by components of this intelligent controller 10 as well as by the CPU. In Figure 4a, signal SFO, developed in this circuit, signalDMAREQ from DMA terminal R34, from the PSC 28 are inputs toAND circuit 59 whose output is the D input to flip flop 61. TheQ output of flip flop 61 is connected to the D input of flip flop 60 which provides inputs to each of open collector NAND gates 71 and 72.

Figure 5 is a flowchart illustrating the operation of store fetch controller 12 in conjunction with DMAIF 11. At state SFO, block 85 asks the question Is there a direct memory access request If the answer is no, nothing happens. If the answer is yes, then the next question at block 86 is whether there is a signal from PSC28 that it has released memory by signalDMAGO If the answer is no, nothing happens. If the answer is yes, then controller is moves into the SF1 Q state and at block 87, it is determined whether there has been access granted. If the answer is no, the controller waits, and if the answer is yes, it moves into state SF2 Q. At block 88, it is determined whether the FETCH MUX signal is present. If the answer is yes, a fetch cycle is started and if the answer is no, a store cycle is started n either event, at block 89, it is determined whether there has been an access grant signal. If the answer is no, the controller waits and if the answer is yes, it goes back toSO as indicated at block 90. The outputs of AND circuits 75 78 indicate data active or not active for the various controllers that have the facility for reading. These outputs tell those controllers that the reading is completed. Referring now to Figure 6A, input signals DEVMRD device memory read data 13, 14 and 15 are applied on terminalsT71, T76 and T81, respectively. These three signals represent the three highest order bits in the ATI 1 automatic transfer instruction word from the CPU and select the intelligent controller.

The clock input to flip flop 96 is the signal CLXTPC developed as shown in Fig. 3. The combination Clien of flip flops 95 and 96 is simply to synchronize the incoming infor action with the intelligent controller clock. The Q output of flip flop 95 is applied as one input to NOR circuit 97 whose other input is supplied by the Q output of flip flop 96 and whose output is inverted through inverter 98 providing the signal THIS DEV this device selected . A synchronize combination is also formed by the combination of flip flops 99 and 101 with the Q output of flip flop 99 being connected to the D input of flip flop 101 and the Q output of flip flop 101 being connected to the clear input of flip flop 99. The clock input to flip flop 99 is a strobed pulse from the instruction word AT12 that followsATI1. The strobe pulse DEVAT12 is applied to terminalTO90 and then to the clock input of flip flop 99. The Qoutput of flip flop 99 is applied as an input to NAND circuit 106 which has another input applied from the Q output of flip flop 95.

The CPU supplied instruction words ATll and T12 have been mentioned above. Also mentioned were the words from the central memory read into memory read data register 109. These words will be dealt with in detail in the description of the operation of the intelligent controller that follows. Please refer to Figure 7C where inverter array 145 is shown having input signals CYREQACT, CYREQSRC, OYREQWSC, CYREQLFC and CYREQLIC applied to input terminals B35, S07, S42, B36 and 337, respectively. These input signals all come from read only memories ROMs from the various controllers in the intelligent controller. Each of the signals is inverted by an individual inverter of the assembly 145 and is applied inverted on terminals 38 312. The signal on 313 is high because of its input being grounded. Referring now to Figure 7A, the inverted signals from the ROMs are shown applied to flip flop array 121 in reverse order, that is, signal CYREQO is applied to terminal D of flip flop 8 of array 121 while signal CYREQ5 is applied to theD terminal of flip flop 3 of array 121. Flip flop array 121 is clocked by the output from NAND circuit 122 which has one input signal SF1 Q applied to terminal B24 and a second input signal, CPU clock, from the central processor applied to terminal TO8 and inverted through inverter 123. The output of inverter 123 carrier signal C.ATErCI which iE available at terminal B26. Figure 7B indicates outputs 2Q 8Q of flip flop array 121 being applied to inputs 1 7 of 8 line to 3 line priority encoder 130 which is a Texas Instruments Type SN74LS148 described beginning at Page 7 151 of the TTL Data Book.

Outputs lQ 7Q of flip flop array 146 are applied to terminals B14 B20, respectively. On Figure 73, terminals B14 B17 are shown connected to inputs 0 3 of data multiplexer 136, Texas Instruments TypeSN74LS151 described beginning at Page 7157 157 of the TTLData Book. The other inputs of multiplexer 136 are gounded and data select signals A, B and C are provided by outputsA2, Al and AO of encoder 130, respectively.

The operation of the apparatus described in Figures 7a 7c is straightforward. That is, a signal from the appropriateROM provides, for example, the input CYREQACT on terminal 335 which is inverted through inverter 145, applied to terminal B8 and then to input 8B of flip flop 121. This signal is eventually applied to input 7 of decoder 130, providing an output signal on AO which is applied to the C data select of multiplexers 136 and 138. If it had been desired to read from memory, then a FETCHACT signal would also be applied to terminal B30 connected to flip flop array 146, providing an output on terminal B14. Terminal 314 is connected to the 0 input of multiplexer 136 data select C active, the FETCH MUX signal on terminal B6 will then be high. Also, one. of inputs Y0 Y4 of decoder 134 is activated, resulting in the signal from the 1Q output of flip flop array 144, GRANTACT being high. Any other requests would be done in like manner. It should be pointed out that in the case of WSC26 and LIC15, only aFETCH cycle and a STORE cycle, respectively, is possible in this preferred embodiment. and therefore each requires a simple cycle request.

Eight bits are transmitted as IVR, IVL signals and the remaining eight bits are control signals, the word being 32 bits long as indicated for the ACT controller 13. Voltage regulator 301 is attached to the microprocessor 300 as in the case of voltage regulator 201 with respect to microprocessor 200 of ACT13 The clock signal CLS8X300 from terminal B66 is inverted through inverter 330 and applied to terminal X2, the output of inverter 330 being biased through resistor R15. to voltage VCC. Signal CLK8X300 is also buffered through buffer 331 whose output is biased through resistor R14 to voltage VCC and which is applied as an input to terminal X1 of microprocessor 300. Microprocessor 300 provides an output from its SC terminal, inverted through inverter 311 which provides the signal LFCSC . The RB terminal of microprocessor 300 provides signal LFCRB and the LB terminal provides output signal LFCL3 . The signal CLRTPC from terminal 367 is applied to the RST terminal and voltage VCC is applied to the HALT terminal of microprocessor 300. LFCLIV3US 0 7 bus 312 is connected to microprocessor 300. As in the case of ACT13, this bus 312 is for inputs which are applied through inverter arrays 316, 317, 318 and 319. Input signals are identified as DPEND GTLMT and WPENDvGTLMT from list fetch controller 14 PSCLPEND Q, WSCLPEND Q,PSCATIFLG Q, WSCATIFLG Q, ATIFUN23, ATIFUN22, and ATIFUN2l from ACT13 HALTPFC Q , HALTWSC Q , MRDPERR , CYGRKNTLFC DATAVLFC and LFCLBFGNT Q from LFC14.

As shown in Figure 23d, bus 321 provides one input, line 2, to AND gate 325 and another input , line 3, to AND gate 326, each of whose other input is provided by clock signal LFCRIVCLK2 from terminal 395. The output of AND gate 325 provides the D input to flip flop 327 which has a clear input provided by signal SRCCLRABORT from terminal S49 and which provides a Q output signal SRCABORT Q to terminal 548. The output of AND gate 326 provides the D input to flip flop 328 which is cleared by signal WSCCLRkBORT rrom terminal S51 and which provides an output on its Q terminal that is signal WSCABORT Q to terminal S50. The circuitry for LFCSTORE FETCH address is shown inFigures 24a. 24d. Signal DATAVLFC from terminal B54 is inverted through inverter 333 and applied as one input to each of NAND gates 330 and 331 whose other inputs are provided by signals PSCCHNLDEN and WSCCHNLDEN, respectively, outputs from flip flop array 306. The output of NAND gate 330 serves as the clock input to flip flop array 335 while the output of NAND gate 331 serves as the clock input ofNAND gate 336. Central memory,bits 00 07 are applied as inputs to each of flip flop arrays 335 and 336. Flip flop arrays 335 and 336 form a part of a chain address register which is the address at which a new routine or program is started without referring back to the CPU.Bits 00 07 of word ATI2SAvE from flip flop 220, reflecting one output from the control section 206 of ROM 202 of ACT13, is applied through buffer array 334. Buffer array 334 is gated by signal ATI20E from flip flop array 326 as shown onFigure 23b. Referring to Figure 24b, signal WSCCARLD from NAND gate 331 clocks flip flop array 349 and signalPSCCARLD from AND gate 330 clocks flip flop array 348. The other half of ATI2 AVE, namely bits 08 15 is applied to buffer array 347 which also is gated by signal ATI202 . The inputs to flip flop arrays 348 and 349 are bits 08 15 from memory. Signal WSCCAROE from flip flop array 326 is used to enable the output of flip flop arrays 336 and 349.Signal PSCCAROE from flip flop array 326 is used to enable the output from flip flop arrays 335 and 348. The output of buffer array 334 is tied together with the outputs from flip flop arrays 335 and 336 in bus 338 which provides inputs to counters 340 and 341 shown inFigure 24C. The output from buffer array 347 is tied to the outputs from flip flop arrays 348 and 349 in bus 351 which is shown providing inputs, in Figure 24d, to counters 352 and 353. Counters 340, 341, 352 and 353 are all clocked by signal L CMCCLS from terminal 399. In this preferred embodiment, these counters are Texas Instr ents Type SN74LSl63ASynchronous FourBit Counters, described beginning at page 7 190 of theTTL DAta Book. The load inputs for these counters is provided by the output from NAND gate 343.The inputs toNAND gate 343 are provided by line 6 of bus 321 and clock signal LFCRIVCLK2 from terminal B95. Potential VCC is applied to the one enable terminal so that when the other enable terminal has a potential provided by the output ofAND gate 354, the counters are enabled. AND gate 354 has input signals from line 7 of bus 321 and clock signalLFCRIVCLK2 from terminal 395. This enable signal causes the counter combination of counters 340, 341, 352 and 353 to add one count. The outputs of counters 340 and 341, as shown in Figure 24c, are combined and buffered through buffer array 345 which is gated by the output of AND gate 344. The inputs toAND gate 344 are signals FETCHLFCEN and STORELFCEN from terminals B42 and B43, respectively. The outputs from counters 352 and 353 of Figure 24d are combined and buffered through buffer array 355 which is enabled by the output ofAND gate 344. The outputs of buffer arrays 345 and 355 are applied to MAD bus 39. It can be seen then that the circuitry of Figures 24a24d is designed to provide addresses dependent upon information from the central memory of the CPU. Specifically, an address for saving the ATI2 word is provided, as well as other addresses from the CPU central memory for fetching and storing. The list buffer 17 of Figure la, in this preferred embodiment, has the capability of storing a total of 256 16bit words. This capacity is divided up by providing 16 blocks of eight words each for the WSC section and 16 blocks of eight words each for the PSC section. That is, output operations for WSC26 and input operations for PSC28 may be stored prior to their use in list buffer 17. To provide this feature of having such information available, it is necessary that the limit of the list buffer 17 not be exceeded. The circuitry for determining the limits is illustrated in Figures 25 and 26. In Figure 25, signals PSCLIMIT O 3 Q from terminal 3100 of Fig. 21 provide four inputs to comparator 360. Four other input signals for comparison are provided from counter 362. Counter 362, in this preferred embodiment, is a TexasInstruments Type 74LS193 described beginning at page 7 306 of the TTL Data Book.

Counter 362 counts under control of these various signals and applies the result to comparator 360 which compares the information from counter 362 with the process sequence controller limit number. If the limit number is smaller than the number from the counter, an output signal PDENDXGTLMT is present, as indicated. Counter 366 is identical to counter 362 except that its down count input is provided by signal PSCLiST .Ml which is provided ultimately from the ROM of list interpret controller 15. The four outputs from counter 366 are inverted through inverter array 364 and applied to bus 374, identified as LICLIVBUS 0 7 . The circuit of Figure 26 is identical tothat of Figure 25 except for the input signals. That is, comparator 361 identical to comparator 360 receives input signalsWSCLIMIT 3 Q from terminal B101. The output signal from comparator 361 is identified as WPENDGTLMT. The count down input to counter 363 identical to counter 362 is provided by signal WTEND1 from terminal T85. The count up input is provided by NAND gate 389 whose inputs are signals LFCRIVBUSl from bus 321 and clock signal LFCRIVCLR2 from terminal B102.

The output of counter 367 is buffered through buffer array 365 which is gated by line 6 of the left interface vector bus of LIC15, as is buffer array 364. The output from buffer array 365 is connected to bus 374 over line 375. Figure 27 simply illustrates the circuitry required to store list word 1 back in the memory. The signal LBUFDI Ol 15 Q is provided from the list buffer 17 and is buffered through buffer array 377 whose output is enabled by the output from AND gate 378. The inputs to AND gate 378 are signals STORELPC N . from terminal 343 and LWI.SWDOE from flip flop array 326. The output of buffer array 377 is applied to device memory write data bus 379. Figure 28 illustrates the development of certain clock pulse signals from bus 321. LrCRIVI , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 are applied as one input to each of AND gates 381, 382, 383 and 384 and NOR gate 385, respectively. The above mentioned gates are enabled by signal LFCMCCLR from terminal 399. The output from AND gate 382 is applied to one input of NAND gate 380 whose other input is voltageVCC, providing an output signal LFCRiVCLK2 on terminal 3102. AND gates 381 384 provide output signals LFCRIVCLR1 , 2 , 3 and 4 on terminals 394 397, respectively. NOR gate 385 provides signal LFCRTVCLRi on terminal 398.

Associated with microprocessor 700 is voltage regulator 701 and ROM 702, such ROM being divided into the IR section 703, the IVR IVL section 704 and the control CTL section 705. The gate outputs of section 705 provide inputs to flip flop array 714 which is clocked by signal WSCMCCLK , the output from inverter 710 of Figure 54b. The outputs from flip flop array 71o, shown in Fig. 54a, are the signals WSCBY4 l WSCHLTCLRWS WRTLSH CYREQWSC WSCFILADR 23 20 .

Another input set is.from bus 713 which carries information from register 19 of Fig. la. Four bit buses 716 and 717 apply data from the formatter to bus 715. RAM 721 provides eight inputs to bus 715. RAM 721 is a Texas InstrumentsType 745189 described in the Bipolar Microcomputer Components Data Book. RAM 721 is incorporated in this design to extend the eight internal registers of microprocessor 700 to a total of 24. In this particular application, many registers are required to maintain flag information, etc.The address signals for RAM 721 are signals WSCFILADR 23 20 from flip flop array 714. The information to be stored comes from the write interface vector bus 720 of WSC26. The iS input of RAM 721 has signal WSCRIVCLK9 applied to it, which signal also provides one input to AND gate 722 whose other input is provided by the signal WSCLIVSELS . The output of AND gate 722 provides the input to the CS terminal of RAM 721. Bus 715 provides the inputs to inverter array 721 whose outputs form bus 720. Line 1 of bus 720 provides one input to NAND gate 719 whose other input is signal WSCRIV4 and whose output is signal WSCCLRA3ORT , applied to terminalS49. Flip flop array 722 receives eight inputs from bus 720, is clocked by signal WSCRIVCLKl and provides output signals WSCDS 0 l Q which are the density signal array and signalsWSCTA 0 2 Q which are a tape address signal array to the formatter selector.

The r SC2D signals are interpreted as follows. WRT 00001 WRD O0ll1 UNL 01111 WFM 11111 ERG 10111 EVG 10110 CLR 10011 NOP 00000 TUS 10101 SNS l0100 Another output of array 723 is inverted through inverter 724 and provides the signal WSCLVL1K applied to terminal 541. Eight line bus 550 from bus 720 is applied to the WSC status FIFO, described below. Lines 2 7 form bus 718 from bus and are 720, applied to register 18. Eight lines from bus 720 are applied to the WSC byte counter, described below. Line 2 from bus 720 provides one input to AND gate 726 whose other input is provided by the signal WSCRIV4 . The output of AND gate 726 is connected to the J input terminal of flip flop 727 which is clocked by the signal WSCMCCLK .The Q output of flip flop 727 is signal WPcNDaMl , applied to terminal T85 and also to the K input of flip flop 727. Figures 55a, 55b and 55c illustrate circuitry for the development of the various control and clock signals used, primarily, by WSC26. Figure 55a illustrates inverter 730, inverting signalWSCRIVCLK4 and applying it as one input to each of AND gates 729 and 731. The other input to AND gate 729 is line 3 of bus 720 and the other input to AND gate 731 is line 4 of bus 720. The output of AND gate 729 is connected to theJ input of flip flop 732 and the output of AND gate 731 is connected to the J input of flip flop 733. Both of these flip flops are clocked by the signal WSCMCCLK . The Qoutput of flip flop 732 provides signal REWACK Q and also is connected to the K input of flip flop 732. The Q output of flip flop 733 provides the signal WSCCCL Q and its Q output is connected to its X input. In Figure 55b, decoder 735 is shown. Decoder 735 is a Texas Instruments Type 74S138 3 to 8 line decoder described beginning at page 7 134 of the TTL Data Book.Signal WSCRIVO Q, from flip flop array 706 provides the G1 enable input with signal WSCMCCLK providing the G2B enable input, enable input G2A being grounded. The select inputsA, B and C of decoder 735 have applied to them signals WSCRIv 1 3 Q, respectively, from flip flop array 706. THe output of decoder 735 is one of eight lines selected by the.three select inputs as dictated by the three enable inputs, the output signals identified as WSCRIVCLK 8 15 . Figure 55c illustrates decoders 736 and 737, identical to decoder 735. Enable input G2B of decoder 736 is activated by signal WSCMCCLK , enable input G2A is activated by signalWSCRIV0 Q and enable input G1 is connected to voltage vCC.The select inputs A, 5 and C of decoder 736 are activated by the signals WSCRIV 1 3 Q, respectively, The output of decoder 736 provides signals WSCRIvCLK 0 7 . The G2A enable input signal for decoder 737 is provided by signal WSCLIV0 Q and enable input G1 is connected to voltage VCC. The select inputs A, B and C are provided by signals WSCLIV 1 3 Q, respectively. The output from decoder 737 are the signals WSCLIVFCL 0 7 . These three circuits, in straightforward fashion, provide the signals that will be referenced and which have previously been referenced as inputs. Figure 56 is a schematic diagram of the circuitry required for addressing the central memory for data to be written on tape. Such addressing is accomplished by a counter assembly made up of individual counters 740, 741, 742 and 743, all Texas Instruments Type 74LS163, previously mentioned. The T and P inputs of counter 745 are connected to the output of OR gate 749 whose inputs are the signalsWRTLSH , inverted from flip flop array 714, and TWFIFOSTBfrom the output of OR gate 772. A ripple carry output of counter 745 provides the T and P enable inputs for counter 746 and the P enable inputs for counters 747 and 748. The ripple carry output of counter 746 provides the T enable input for counter 747 whose ripple carry output provides theT enable input to counter 748.The LD inputs of counters 740 and 741 are provided by the signal WSCRIV10 and for counters 742 and 743 are provided by the signal WSCRIVll .The counters are all clocked by signal WSCMCCLK. The four outputs from counter 740 are combined with the four outputs from 741 and buffered through buffer 474 whose output is enabled by the signal FETCHWSCEN from terminal 565. The four outputs from counter 742 are combined with the four outputs from 745 and buffered through buffer 748 whose output is enabled by the signal from terminal S65. The outputs from buffers 747 and 748 are combined in terminal 750 and from there go to the memory address bus 39. The input signals are supplied over buses 740, 741, 742 and 743 to counters 748 745, respectively. These buses are connected to bus 720. Figure 57 illustrates another counter, this one for counting the bytes to write on tape. The inputs come from bus 720, exacctly as in the case of the address counter, with bus 752 carrying lines 0 3, bus 753 carrying lines 4 7, bus 754 carrying lines 0 3 and bus 755 carrying lines 4 7 to counters 759, counter 758, 575 and 756, respectively. These counters are identical to those described in Figure 56. TheT and P enable inputs to counter 756 are provided by the signal WSCBYI 1, from flip flop array 714. The interconnection between the counters is identical to that described with respect to Figure 56. The LD inputs to counters 758 and 759 are provided by the signal WSCRIV7 and the LD inputs to counters 757 and 756 are provided by signal WSCRIV8 .All of the counters are clocked by the signal WSCMCCLK .None of the outputs from the count are used, but the ripple carry out of counter 759, signal WSCBYtC04 provides the J input to flip flop 760 which is clocked by signal WSCMCCLK , whose K input is supplied by signal WSCRIV7 and whose Q output is signal WSCXFRCONP Q. This counter operates by loading the one s complement of the number of bytes to be written and then incrementing until a signal sets flip flop 760. Figures 58a and 58b schematically illustrate a 32 byte tape write FIFO. The FIFO units themselves, 768 771, areTexas Instruments Type 74S225, described earlier. Information to be written comes from the memory in the form of signals DEVMRD 00 15 with bits 0 7 providing inputs to flip flop array 762 and bits 8 15 providing inputs to flip flop array 763. Both of these flip flops are clocked by the signal DATAVWSC . The output enable signal for flip flop array 762 is provided by signal WRTLSH, from flip flop array 714 and the output enable signal of array 763 is provided by signal WRTLSH , the output of inverter 764.Outputs 0 7 from each of flip flops 762 and 763 are combined and then divided into bits 0 3 which provide inputs to FIFO 768, and into bits 4 7 which provide inputs to FIFO 769. Signal WSCRIVCLK4 provides one input to each of OR gates 772 and 773 whose other inputs are provided by lines 7 and 6, respectively of bus 720. The output from.NOR gate 772 provides the CK A and CK B inputs to FIFO 768 and 769. The output of NOR gate 773 provides the CLR input to all of FIFO s 768 771. The OR outputs from each of FIFO s 768 and 769 are connected to the CK A and CK B inputs of each of FIFO s 770 and 771, respectively. The data out from each of FIFO s 768 and 769 provide the data into each of FIFO s 770 and 771, respectively. The CK OUT output of FIFO s 770 and 771 are connected to provide the UNLD CKIN pin of each of FIFO s 768 and 769, respectively. The IR outputs fromFIFO s 768 and 769 provide the inputs to NOR gate 775 whoseOutput is signal TWFIFOFUL.The OR output from FIFO s 770 and 771 provide the inputs to NOR gate 776 whose output is signal TWFIFOEMPTY. The UNLD CKN activating signal for FIFO s 770 and 771 is provided by the signal WSCAK . The four bits out of FIFO s 770 and 771 are combined as eight inputs to flip flop array 774. Flip flop array 774 is clocked by the signal TWC1 Q, inverted through inverter 777. The outputs of flip flop array 774 are signals TWDAT 0 7 Q which are used in the formatter selector, discussed later. As can be seen, the purpose of this FIFO is simply to store information that is to be written on tape. As indicated, the structure and operation of the FIFO s making up thisFIFO assembly is well known. Figure 60 is a schematic representation of the TWC controller which controls the mechanism for writing on the tape. At the heart of this controller is shift register 795 which is a Texas Instruments Type 74LS195 4 parallel access shift register, mentioned earlier. Signals WSCDAK and TWC2 Q provide two of the parallel inputs to register 795 with the two remaining inputs grounded. Signal WSCRIVCLK4 is inverted through inverter 786 and provides one input to NAND gate 787 whose other input is provided by line 5 of bus 720. The output of NAND gate 787 is inverted through inverter 791, providing serial.inputs J and K to register 795. SignalWSCMCCLK provides the CLK input to register 795. The output from NAND gate 787 provides one input to NAND gate 788. The other Input from NAND gate 788 is provided by the output from NOR gate 789.AND gate 790 provides one input toNOR gate 789. Signal SWCDRQ provides one input to AND gate 790. The other input to AND gate 790 is provided by outputQ from regiser 795. The other inputs to NOR gate 789 are B provided by outputs Q and Q of register 795. The output A C of NAND gate 788 provides the shift load input signal to register 795. Signal CLRTPC provides both inputs to one of two AND gates in an AND OR INVERT gate. The other AND gate has as one input signal TWCFIFOEMPTY and as the other input has the signal from terminal Q of register 795. The output of CAND OR invert logic 792 provides the CLR input to register 795. It also is inverted through inverter 793 to provide signal WSCLBY. The output of logic 792 provides the J input to flip flop 794 which is clocked by signal WSCMCCLK . TheX input to flip flop 794 is provided by signal WSCRIV7 and the Q output is signal WSC TER Q. Figure 59 is a flowchart illustrating the operation ofFigure 60. At decision block 780, a determination of whether signal TWCGO, the output of inverter 791, is made. If the signal is present, the operation proceeds to block 781 which is state TWCl Q. At that point, signals FIFOUT 0 7 are gated out of FIFO s 770 and 771 by the signal WSCDAK , from the Q output of shift register 795. Also at that D time, flip flop 774 is clocked by signal TWC1 Q from output QA ofregister 795 to send out signals TWDAT 0 7 Q to the formatter selector. At that point, state TWC2 Q arrives at decision block 782 where it is determined whether there has been a data request. If the answer is no, the system remains in state TWC2 Q until there is such a request. If the answer is yes, the system moves into atete TWC3 Q at decision block 782 where it is determined whether the TWC FIFO is empty or not.If it is not empty, then at block 785 a data acknowledge signal is generated and the system returns to state TWCI Q. If the FIFO is empty, block 784, the signal last byte is generated and the sequence is ended. Figure 61 is a map of the contents of ROM 702. FORMATTER SELECTOR SWITCH Formatter selector switch 31 communicates with WSC26, SRC27, TWC29 and DRC30 for selecting, in this preferred embodiment, formatter A or formatter B which control up to eight tape transports each. As indicated earlier, in this preferred embodiment, if one tape transport is in the read mode in formatter A, for example, then formatter B can have one tape transport operating in the write mode. No two transports can be operating in the same mode at the same time. Figure 62 schematically represents the prioritizing circuitry of formatter selector switch 31. The priority is arranged between the write sequence controller 26 and the system read controller 27. Each of those controllers must test the other s formatter usage prior to setting its formatter flag. When WSC26 is using a formatter to check rewind status, it sets the REWLOOK Q flag. If SRC27 needs the formatter and it is busy, SRC27 tests the REWLOOK Q flag and if it is set, SRC27 waits for FMTR N to become available instead of reporting formatter busy statusThe SRC must 1. Test 2. set 3. Test again This testing is necessary in the event that SWC26 and SRC27 flags got set at exactly the same time, i.e., on the same clock edge. In this case, the SWC26 will win. Figure 62 has five flip flops, 810 814. Conductor 1 of the WSCRIV bus 720 provides the J input to flip flop 810.Conductor 2 of bus 720 provides the J input to flip flop 811. Conductor 6 of bus 720 is connected to the J input terminal of flip flop 814. Conductor 7 of SRCRIV bus 496 is connected to the J input of flip flop 812. Conductor 7 of bus 496 is connected to the J input of flip flop 813. The clock input to flip flop 810 is provided by the signal WSCRIVCLK3 . Conductor 3 of bus 720 is connected to inverter 815 whose output is connected to the K input of flip flop 810. Flip flop 810 provides, on its Q output, signal FATOWSC Q which is the formatter A to WSC signal.The complement of the signal appears on the Q output of flip flop 810. The clock input of flip flop 811 is signal WSCRIVCLK3and the signal applied to the K input is from the output of inverter 815. The Q output of 811 provides signal. FBTOWSC Q formatter B to WSC .

The Q output of flip flop 814 is the signal REWLOOK Q, the flag that is tested by SRC27. NAND gates 819 and 820 are connected in parallel with their inputs coming from the Q output of flip flop 810 and the Q output of flip flop 812 providing signals FATOWSC Qand FBTOSRC Q , respectively. The output of these two NAND gates is the signal FBTOSRC. NAND gate 821 has its inputs provided by the Q output of flip flop 811 and the Q output of flip flop 813 providing signals FBTOWSC Q and FATOSRC Q , respectively. The output of NAND gate 821 is signal FBTOSWC. Figures 63a, 63b and 63c are schematics of the formatter commands developed from signals provided by WSC26 and SRC27. Figure 63a illustrates four selectors, Texas InstrumentsType 74Si58 Quad 2 to l line Data Selector, mentioned earlier. The select input of these four selectors is activated by signal FBTOSRC, the signal output from NAND gates 819 and 820. The inputs to selectors 805 and 806 are identical, except that they are applied to different input connections, resulting in a different pattern of output signals, albeit identical output signals. Signal WSCCCL Q is applied to pins la and 4b of sectors 806 and 805, respectively. SignalWSCDAK is applied to pins 2a and 3b WSCLBY is applied to pins 3a and 2b WSCDS1 Q is applied to 4a and lb SRCCCL is applied to lb and 4a DAKDRC Q is applied to 2b and 3a GROUND is applied to 3b and 3a SRCDS1 Q is applied to Ab and la.

Figure 63b also illustrates four selectors of the same type as those illustrated in Figure 63a with the select signal for all four being FBTOSRC.The input signals are again arranged in identical fashion to the input signals with respect to selector pairs 805806 and 807 808. The inputs to selectors 825 and 826 are WSCCND 0 3 Q and SRCCMD 0 3 Q. Likewise, the inputs to selectors 827 and 828 are arranged identically to the inputs to selectors 825 and 826 except that only three inputs are available for each half. The inputs are WSCCMD4 Q, WSCESCO Q, WSCESC1 Q,SRCCMD4 Q, SRCESO Q and SRCESC1 Q. Input pins 4a and 4b of selector 828 are open, as are input pins lb and la of selector 827.

Signals TWDAT 0 7 Q from flip flop array 774 are applied to the inputs of inverter arrays 830 and 832.Signal FBTOSRC provides the output enables for inverter array 832 and is inverted through inverter 831 to provide the output enable signals for inverter array 830. The output signals from inverter array 830 are FADAT 0 7 and the output signals from inverter array 832 are FBDAT 0 7 . Figures 64a and 64b depict, in schematic form, the generation of formatter status sent to SRC 27. Figure 64a illustrates three selectors, Texas Instruments Type 74LS257Quad Data Selectors described beginning at page 7 372 of theTTL Data Book. Selectors 835 and 836 have their output control activated by signal SRCLIVSEL8 and selector 837 has its output control activated by signal SRCLIVSEL9 . Each of selectors 835 837 have the signal FBTOSRC applied to their select input.

Applied to selector 844 are signals FADAT 4 7 and FBDAT 4 7 . Referring to both Figures 64a and 64b, the outputs of selectors 835, 836, 837, 840 and 841 are buses 491, 492, 493, 494 and 495, respectively, all buses being connected to the SRCLIV bus 488. The output signals from selector 842 are SRCDRQ and SRCTRDB. The outputs from selectors 843 and 844 are signals SRCTRD 0 3 and SRCTRD 4 7 , respectively. Figure 65 illustrates two selectors 848 and 849 for formatter selection in response to a WSC select. TheseFBTOWSC applied. The inputs to selector 848 are signals FES O 3 and FBS 0 3 . The inputs to selector 849 are signals FAES 4 7 and FBES 4 7 . The outputs of selectors 848 and 849 are buses 716 and 717, respectively, which connect to WSCLIV bus 715. Figure 66 schematically depicts circuitry for sending formatter status in response to WSC select. Selectors 851854 854 are shown. Selectors 851 853 are Texas InstrumentsType 74LS257 and selector 854 is a Texas Instruments Type 74LS258, which is the same as the 74LS257, except that the outputs are inverted. The output control terminals of selectors 851 and 852 have signal WSCLIVSEL2 applied and the output control terminal of selector 853 has signal WSCLIVSEL3 applied. The output control terminal of selector 854 is grounded. The select input of all of selectors 851 854 has signal FBTOWSC applied. Signals WSCABORT Q from terminal S48 supplies an input to each half of selector 851. Signal FAXPRTDY is inverted through inverter 855 and applied as an input to selector 851. Signal FAOVR provides one input to AND gate 856 whose other input is provided by signal WSCRATER Q and whose output signal, FARATER is applied as an input to selector 851. Signal FBXPRTDY is inverted through inverter 857 whose output signal FBRDY is applied as an input to the second half of selector 851.

The second half of selector 853 has signals FABPTRDY , FBEDT , FBERR and FBPERapplied as inputs. Selector 854 has signal FADRQ applied to the first half and signal FBDRQ applied to the second half. The outputs of selectors 851 853 are buses 801, 802 and 803, respectively, all of which are connected to WSCLIV bus 715. The output signal from selector 854 is WSCDRQ which is applied to AND gate 790 of Figure 60. The various signals from the formatters A and B are peculiar to this particular application wherein magnetic tape transports are the input output devices. It should be understood, of course, that the signals will vary, depending upon the particular type of input output device. PROCESS SEQUENCE CONTROLLER The third section of the intelligent controller is the process sequence controller section. The central element is a concatenation of four Advanced Micro Devices 2901Bit Slice Processing Elements, known as the microprocessor unit MPU . The MPU is controlled by the contents of a ROM not shown which may be made up of Texas Instruments Type 745472, mentioned earlier, to provide command words that are 64 bits in length. The ROM is addressed by four TexasInstruments Type 74S482 4 Bit Slice Expandable ControlElements not shown which provide the sequencing function that is not available in the MPU. The sequencer and ROM combination are present to provide the commands to the MPU and to other components associated with the MPU in the process sequence controller section. FIGURE 67 illustrates, in block form, process sequence controller 28. PSC FIFO 903 receives input signals TRD 00 19 from flip flop arrays 664 and 665 shown in Figure 50c of theData Read Controller 30. Certain informational bits are also sent, such as parity end of data, scan detect and scan length error. The data bits are sent from buffer 903 to memory 901, Buf A section. FIFO controller 904 controls the flow of data from PSC FIFO 903 to memory 901. Addresses are provided from FIFO controller 904 and MPU 900 through selector 907.Up down counter 905 is used to monitor the incoming information and the availability of memory space, providing an indication Test A 0 that there is space over line 906 to MPU 900.MPU 900 provides line IPBUFSELCT to control selector 907. The selector 907 allows MPU 900 to address memory 901 so that information will be transmitted into MPU 900 for processing, and also allows addressing of memory 901 for loading information from FIFO 903.Store controller 910 is identical to FIFO controller 904 and controller 910 loads information from memory 902 into central memory, through selector 911.MPU 900, through selector 911, addresses memory 902 to cause processed data to be removed from MPU 900 and stored in memory 902. Buf A section of memory 901 may be swapped with the Buf B section and Buf C section of memory 902 may be swapped with Buf D section. This is referenced in Figure 68 by a simple table with the buffer sections indicated at the left of the illustrated block. The swapping function is accomplished by hardware shown in Figs. 71 and 73. The table indicates that, at time tlr the input buffer is Buf A, the process buffer is Buf B, the processor OP buffer is Buf C and the store DMA buffer is Buf D. At time t2, the roles are reversed, as indicated. This enables fast movement of data from theFIFO into the memory 901 and then into MPU900 for processing.The processed data then is transmitted into memory 902, into either buffer C or buffer D, depending upon the swap status.The processed information is then sent to the central memory The store controller, 910, functions much like theFIFO controller 904 in that its function is to take data out of the store DMA buffer and send it to the central memory. In this particular application, the amount of data that is transmitted for processing through MPU 900 is so great that the swapping of buffers must be done to be able to keep the dataqflowing. That is, if the memories 901 and 902 were infinitely large, the swapping arrangement shown herein would not be necessary. In this application, however, it is necessary that information be processed through MPU 900 while the input buffer is receiving data to keep the stream continuous. Figure 63 illustrates the PSC FIFO 903 which is made up of four Texas Instruments Type 745225, FIFO s mentioned earlier. Signal FIFOEN from a ROM not shown provides one input to AND gate 919 whose other input is signal FIFOST02. The output of AND gate 919 provides one input to OR gate 920 whose other input is signal FIFOCK, the generation of which is described below. The output of NOR gate 920 is signal FIFOUTEN which provides one input to NAND gate 921 whose other input is provided by the clock signal SYCK which is the system clock at 4MHz. The output of NAND gate 921 provides the input to the UNLOADCKN pin of each. of FIFO s 915, 916, 917 and 918.The FIFO write strobe signal FIFOWRTSTB provides the CK B input to each of the FIFO s and the signal ISTB provides the clear input for each of the FIFO s. Signals TRD00 TRD04 are the inputs to FIFO 915 with corresponding outputs FIFO00 F1F004. Signals TRD05 TRDO9 provide inputs to FIFO 916 with corresponding outputs FIFO05 to FIFO09. Input signals TRD10 through TRD14 are provided to FIFO 917 with corresponding outputs FIFO10 FIFO14. Signals TRD15, EODFLG, SCANDET, and SLE provide inputs toFIFO 918 with corresponding outputs FIFO 15, EODFG F,SCANDET F and SLE F. The development of certain control signals should also be pointed out at this time. Outputs IRI from FIFO 915, 1R2 from FIFO 916, IR3 from FIFO 917 and 1R4 from FIFO 918 are all applied as inputs to NAND gate 923 which provides the signal FIFOOFUL. Outputs OR1, OR2, OR3 and OR4 from FIvO s 915 918, respectively, provide inputs to AND gate 924 whose output is connected to the D input of flip flop 925, clocked by system clock SYCK and having a Q output signal EMPTY Q and Q output signal EM2TY Q . Figure 70 is a schematic diagram of the controller 904 of Figure 67. Nand gate 930 has buffer full signal BUFUL as one input and signal FIrOSTO2 as its other input. Its output is connected to the K terminal of flip flop 932, whose Q output provides one input to AND gate 933. SignalFWPSLD from MPU 900 is inverted through inverter 931 and provides the other input to AND gate 933. The output of AND gate 933 is signal FIFOSTOORST which is a reset signal providing one input to OR gate 935 and which also provides an input to the J terminal of flip flop 932. Signal FIFOSTO2 provides one input to AND gate 934 whose other input is provided by the signal FICLK which comes from the ROM not shown .The output signal from 934, FIFOCK provides the other input to OR gate 935 and as indicated above, provides the other input to OR gate 920. The output ofOR gate 935 is connected tb the J input of flip flop 936 which is clocked by the system clock and whose Q output provides one input to AND gate 938. Signal IMBSY, from theROM, is inverted through inverter 937 and provides another input to 938. The third input to 938 is the signal EMPTY Q from the flip flop 925. The output of AND gate 935 is ocmYsi ed to the D input of flip flop 942 which is clocked by the system clock SYCK and whose K input is provided by signalBUFUL. The Q output of flip flop 942 is signal FIFoSTO2,which provides an input to NAND gate 930.The output of AND gate 938 is also inverted through inverted 939 and provides one input to NAND gate 940 whose other input is provided by the signal IMLD , from the ROM. The output of NAND gate 940 provides one input to NAND gate 941 whose other input is the signal SYCK, its output being the signal IMWEN. Figure 71a illustrates AND gate 943 whose inputs are signals SLE J from the FIFO and signal FIFOSTOZ mentioned earlier. Its output is inverted through inverter 944 providing control signal FIFOSLE . Figure 71b illustrates NAND gate 723 having inputs IRl IR4 providing output signal FIFOFUL. Figure 71c illustrates NAND gate 924 having inputsOR1 OR4, providing output signal EMPTYD which provides the J input of flip flop 925 whose Q output is EMPTY Q, and which is clocked by signal SYCK. Figure 71d illustrates signal SWAPIM from the ROM applied to the J input of flip flop 926, and inverted through inverter 927 and applied to the R input. Flip flop 926 is clocked by system clock SYCK, providing on itsQ output signal BFRIM Q and on its Q output signal BFRIM Q . Figure 71e illustrates the signal SWAPIMN from theROM applied to the J input of flip flop 928 with signalSWAPIMN applied to the K input. Flip flop 928 is clocked by the system clock and provides output signal BFRIMN Q on the Q output and signal BFRIMN Q on the Q output. Figure 72 is a flowchart representing the function of the controller 904. Block 930 illustrates the controller being in state So00. At block 931, it is determined whether there is a FIFO start signal. If the answer is yes at decision block 932, it is determined whether there is anEMPTY Q signal. If the answer is yes, then the controller remains in state FIFO STO1. If the answer is no, then at decision block 933, it is determined whether the internal memory is busy by the signal IMBSY Q.If the answer is yes, the controller waits in state FIFO STO1 until the answer becomes no, at which time at block 934, the FIFO contents are transferred to the internal memory, which is memory 901 shown in Fig. 67 The operation then moves to block 935 where internal memory address plus one is transferred to the internal memory and the word count minus one is transferred to the word counter. The operation then enters stateFIFOST02 and at decision block 936 it is determined whether a READ BYTES signal is present. If the answer is yes, then at decision block 937, it is determined whether theWORDCOUNT 0, and if the answer is yes, then the system goes to block 947 where a 1 is transferred to the BUFFER FULL count and the system returns to the beginning at state FIFO STOO shown at 948.If, at decision block 937, itis determined that the word count is not zero, then at block 938 it is determined whether there is an END OF DATA flag present. If the answer is yes, then a 1 is transferred to the END OF DATA flag at block 939, terminating the operation. If the answer is no, then at block 945 there is a read FIFO operation and the system, at block 946, returns to state FIFOSTO1. If at block 936 there was no READ BYTE signal, then at decision block 940, it is determined whether there is aSCAN DETECT, the operation goes to block 947 with a transfer of one to the BUFFER FULL flag. If the answer is no, a decision at block 941 as to whether there is an END OF DATA flag. If the answer is yes, then at block 944, a 1 is transferred to the END OF DATA flag and the operation terminates. If the answer is no, then at decision block 942, it is determined whether there is a SYSTEMLENGTH ERROR flag.. If the answer is yes, then a 1 is transmitted to the SLE Q flag at block 943 and the operation terminates. If the answer is no, then a READ FIFO operation occurs at block 945 and the system, at block 946 returns to state 01. Figures 73a 73d in more detailed block diagram form, illustrate PSC 28. In Figure 73a, selector 960 is shown with input selection signals from the ROM not shown as MPUDSEL1 MPUDSEL3. Selector 960 is made up of 16 Texas Instruments Type 251Data Selectors, described beginning at page 7 362 of the TTLData Book. The signals available as inputs to selector 960 are TCB 0 4 and BRADD 00 10 from the ROM LIC words 0015 from Figure 75 internal memory address signals IMAD central memory address signals CMAD normalize data from normalizer 969 NORMDAT tape read data FIFO information FIFO internal memory data IMD and memory read data MRD . This data selection is done according to the table shown in Figure 74 where the ROM information is referred to as INTEGER . Inputs to MPU 900 include the information from selector 960 by way of bus MPUD 00 15 and input signals from theROM. These include MPUIO , inverted through inverter 961 and applied to the I0 input MPUI inverted through inverter 962 and applied to terminal I1, MPUI6 inverted through inverter 963 and applied to terminal I6 MPUI 2, 7, 8 applied to terminals I 2, 7, 8 MPUA 0 3 applied toTerminals ADDA0 3 MPUB 0 3 applied to terminals ADDB 0 3 MPUI 3 5 applied to terminals I 3 5 MPUCN applied to terminal CN system clock signal SYCK applied to C10CX terminal. Buf 906 is connected to MPU 900 and provides 16 inputs to flip flop array 964. Flip flop array 964 is clocked by fihe system clock SYCK providing MPUY 00 15 bus 908 as its outputs. Bus 908 provides inputs to selector 907, to buffer memory 902 and to selector 974. Buf 906 provides inputs to counters 965, 966, 980, 981, 982, 967 and 968, all general purpose 4 bit up down synchronous binary counters, with counters 982, 983 and 967 being made up of three Texas Instruments Type 669 counters, the other counters being made up of four of the TI counters. The counters are general purpose so that their use depends upon the particular application to which the intelligent controller is put. In some.instances, in the application of this preferred embodiment, the counters are dedicated.For example, counter 981 is a central memory address counter counter 982 is an internal memory counter for buffer memory 901 counter 983 is an internal memory address counter for buffer memory 902 counter 967 is a status word counter counter 968 is a words per sector counter. Counter 965 has its load input provided by signalWPSLD and its enable P input provided by signal WPSDEC , both from the ROM. Its carry out signal is WPS O. Its clock input is provided by the system clock signal SYCK , as is the case with all of the counters mentioned above. The load input of counter 966 is provided by signalSKPLD and the enable P input is provided by signalSKPDEC , both from the ROM. The carry out output is the signal SsP O. Counter 980, shown in Fig. 73c, has its LD input supplied by signal XFRLD and its enable P input applied by signalXFRTEC , both signals ultimately provided by the ROM.The output of counter 980 from the CO terminal is signalXFR O . Counter 981 has its LD input provided by signal CMADLDfrom the ROM. Signal CMADINC and signal CNTRSEN , from the ROM, provide inputs to AND gate 984 whose output, signalCMADINCSEL , is applied to the enable P input. The Q outputs are gated through buffer 985 by signal GRANT to provide 16 inputs to the. memory address bus 39. Counter 982r which is the address counter for the buffer memory 901, has its load input provided by signalCIMADLD and its enable P input provided by signal CIMADINC , both from the ROM. Its output is address buf CIMAD 01 ll . Counter 983, which is the memory address counter for buffer memory 902 has its load input provided by signalCIMNADLD and its enable P input provided by signal D A,9CSTO1 both from the ROM. Its output is CIMNAD 01 ll . Counter 967, shown in Fig. 73d, has its load input provided by signal STWCNTLD and its enable P input provided by signal CNTRSEN . Its carry out output provides the signal STwCNT 0 . Ccounter 967, in this application counts the status words. The load input signal to counter 968 is signal FWPSLDand the P enable signal is IMW with the carry out output being signal FWPSC0 . Flip flop array 978, shown in Figure 73b, receives bus 906 and provides output signals EXFG 00 l5 . Selector 993 which is a Texas Instruments Type 74LS257 has 16 inputs from bus 908 and 16 inputs from FIFO 903. A selection between the output of FIFO 903 or MPU 900 is made based upon the signal IMLD from MPU 900, such signal providing the selection input to selector 907. The outputs of selector 993 provide 16 data inputs to buffer memory 901 and also are used to generate a parity signal through parity generator 981 which, in this preferred embodiment, is a Texas InstrumentsType 74180. The output data from memory 901 are signals INDO 00 l5 with parity checker 982, also a Texas InstrumentsType 74180, also receiving the 16 outputs to provide an error signal PARERR. The addressing of memory 901 is accomplished through the use of selector 979 which is made up of Texas InstrumentsType 74LS257 selectors. The selection input is provided by signal IMBSY from the ROM with address signals IMAD 01 11 applied to one half of selector 979 and address signalsCIMAD l ll applied to the other half. Associated with thsignals IMAD 01 ll is signal BFRIM Q from Fig. 71e, the inverse of the swap signal. Associated with signals CIMAD 01 ll is signal BFRIM Q, the true swap signal. The development of signals IMAD 01 ll is not shown, but is identical to the development of the CIMAD signals.That is, a counter receives inputs from buf 906 and supplies the load terminal with signal IMADLD and the enable P input with signal IMADINC . Likewise, the IMNAD 01 11 signal development is not illustrated, but is identical to that of the development of CIMNAD signals. That is, a counter receives eleven signals from bus 906, the counter receives its load input from signal IMNADtD and its P enable input is activated by signal DMACSTOl K . All of these signals are originated in the ROM. In this manner, buffer A or buffer B of memory 901 is selected through selector 979. Selector 980 selects either buffer C or buffer D of memory 902 in the same manner. That is, signals IMNAD 01 ll , together with signal BFRIMN Q are input to one half of the selector, while signal CIMNAD 01 ll , together with signal BFRIMN Q are input to the other half. The select signal, IMNBSY is inverted from the ROM with either buffer C or buffer D being selected. The Output of selector 980, of course, is input to the memory 902 for address selection. The data into buffer C and buffer D comes only from MPU 900 through bus 908. Parity generator 971 and parity check 972 are exactly the same as parity generator 981 and parity check 982 associated with memory 901 and are used in identically the same fashion. Normalizer 969, shown in Fig. 73d, has 16 inputs from bus 906 and is simply a shift register mechanism.The normalizer shifting apparatus used in this preferred embodiment is the Texas Instruments 74LS399 multiplexer described beginning at page 7 499 of the TTL Data Book, and may be used as a universal type register for implementing various shift patterns. In this preferred embodiment, the 74LS399, together with appropriate control, normalizes the input data from bus 906, in a well known manner. Selector 974 receives the bus from buffer memory 902 as one half of its inputs and the bus 908 provides the other half of its inputs. The signal DEVMWDLD causes a selection between these two groups of inputs, and the output bus enters flip flop array 975. Parity generator 973 receives the outputs from selector 974 and its output provides the D input to flip flop 978. NAND gate 976 receives as inputs signals DEvMWDSTR and DEVMWDLD and provides on its output an input to NAND gate 977. The other input to NAND gate 977 is the clock signalSYCK. The output of NAND gate 977 provides the clock input to flip flop array 975 and also to flip flop 978. The outputs from flip flop array 975 provide 16 bits to the MWD bus 37 and the output from flip flop 978, gated through buffer 979 by signal GRANT provides a parity bit to MWD bus 37.

MODE OF OPERATION OF THE INVENTION The intelligent controller IC supervises and controls block transfers of data between the central memory of aTexas Instruments Type 980B Computer in this preferred embodiment and the formatter selector switch 31. A tape write operation to one formatter and a tape read operation to the other formatter may be concurrent. The IC is capable of addressing one of eight transports via each of two independent tape formatters. The IC is capable of maintaining a combined tape read and write rate of l,500 000 bytes per second in the memory image read or write bytes mode of operation.Other data transfer rates are dependent on the internal processing done by the process sequence controller 28 to the incoming data. The operations falling under the write category CATA include any operation requiring tape write functions. These operations are Write bytes Write file mark Erase bytes where a byte is eight bits. The operations faIling under the process category CATB include any operation requiring the transfer or monitor of tape read data or any operation requiring the use of the process sequence control. These operations are Read scans Read bytes Record number search Skip file mark Skip record Any type E list operation SOS definition command Command list nesting or list look ahead fetching is provided for all CATA and CATB operations. A maximum of 16 list blocks, each block having a maximum of 16 8 bit words, for each of PSG 28 or WSC 26, can be acquired on a lookahead fetch basis. This level of list command nesting number of look ahead list fetched and stored in the appropriate LBUF17 section is determined by the value stored into WSC 26 or PSC 28 list look ahead limit counters as determined by the circuitry of Fig. 21. The application of the IC in this preferred embodiment relates to the processing of seismic data. Due to the requirement that the proper data boundaries be maintained in memory when seismic data is read from tape, the IC has the capability to perform a special scan length check. A scan, as used in the SEG seismic formats, consists of a sequence of sample values, one for each channel of the recording system plus other information as may be appropriate . In the formats to be processed by the IC, the scans may contain a variable number of bytes, including a start of scan code, sample values, and any other information bytes that may be appropriate. The beginning of each scan is designated by a start of scan SOS code. The SOS code for type A list commands consists of three bytes of all l1s. The SOS code for type B list commands consist of up to eight bytes defined by the user via the SOS definition list command. As each scan transfer to memory begins, the bytes scan counter of Fig. 43a, 43b is set to N l N is a programmed integer and the count is decremented once for each byte read from tape. If the length of the scan is correct, the counter will decrement to zero as the last byte of the scan is read. The scan length check logic enables the IT to compensate for either short or long scans by insuring that the next scan starts in the proper buffer address. When a long scan is detected, those bytes read after the Bytes Scan counter has decremented to zero, but before the next startof scan code is detected, are discarded. DAta transfer will continue aftter the next SOS code is detected. When a short scan is detected, that is, when a SOS code is detected before the Bytes Scan counter decrements to zero, the remaining bytes of that scan buffer are not stored in central memory. The IC begins transfer of the next scan to the proper buffer in memory. When either a short scan or a long scan is detected during the execution of a type A command list, the SOS code of the following scan is stored with the high order bit of the first byte set to zero. When either a short scan or a long scan is detected during the execution of a Type B command list, the floating point value representing the last seismic sample in the scan is set to all zeros. For Type A list command execution, the point in the data scan at which the SOS search is started will be dependent upon whether the recorded data is one s or two S complement. If one s complement data is specified, the search will start at the beginning of each data scan. If two s complement data is specified, the SOS code detection is inhibited until the end of each scan. Inhibiting the SOS search will be accomplished by waiting until the Bytes Scan counter has decremented to two. This means that if a scan is short by one or two bytes, the next scan will be detected and started in the proper buffer address. However, if the scan is short by three or more bytes the next scan will not be detected and will therefore not be transferred to memory.Bit 0 of the next start of scan code transferred to memory will be reset to zero, indicating that a scan error occurred. The CPU addresses and commands peripherals attached to DMAlFll through SFC12 by use of an ATI instruction. The ATI comprises two 16 bit words ATI1 and ATI2, as shown in Fig.77. ATI1 contains the device address formatter address, and function code. ATI2 contains either an initialization list address, a transport address, or a look ahead limit value. The command list comprises seven different types A,B, C, D, E,,F and G. Type A, shown in Fig. 79a, list emulates the TexasInstruments TIMAP Model 2 half inch tape controller and is software compatible therewith. Type B, shown in Fig. 79b, list is used for seismic read scans operations to detect scans and transfer converted gain millivolt to floating point scan data to memory. Type C, shown in Fig. 79c, list is used for record number search and special read bytes operations. Type D, shown in Fig. 79d, list is used for a ReadSegments operation Ref. Para. 4.3.11 and 5.4 . Type v, shown in Fig. 79e, list is a general purpose user defined list used to process data residing in internal or central memory. Type F, shown in Fig. 79F, list is used to define the seismic start of scan code and replacement early gain value for type B list operations. Type G List is used to down load PSC user micro code into a Fairchild Random Access Memory made up of four Type 94322 units not shown . The format for the automatic transfer initiate instruction ATI is illustrated in Table 4A and defined in the following paragraphs. ATI WORD 1 A strobe accompanies AT1 word 1 which instructs the IC to decode the channel address bits. The IC will respond to any address from 0 through 7, inclusive. If the indicated address bits 13 through 15 coincides with the address assigned hardwired to the IC, bits 8 through. 12 are registered and the appropriate action follows. Bits 8 through 11 are the encoded function to be executed. These functions are listed in the function code table below, and described in the following paragraphs. Bit 12 is the formatter address bit allowing the IC to address one of two tape formatter units, 32 or 33. BIT 8 9 10 11 FUNCTION 1 0 0 0 0 Acquire type A list 2 0 1 0 0 Acquire type A list I 3 0 0 1 0 Rewind transport N 4 0 1 1 0 Rewind transport N I 5 1 0 1 0 Halt PSC I 6 1 1 1 0 Halt WSC I 7 1 1 0 0 Test I . 8 1 0 0 0 Reset IC 9 0 0 0 1 Acquire Type B or Type C or Type D list 10 0 1 1 1 Acquire SOS definition list Type F I 11 1 0 1 1 Set list look ahead limit I 12 1 1 0 1 Rewind and unload xport N I 13 1 1 1 1 PSC RXM down load I I CPU interrupts enabled by ATI function code ATI FUNCTION CODE TABLE 4A A strobe accompanies ATI2 which instructs the IC to accept the second word of the ATI command. For ATI commands requiring a command list to be fetched from central memory,ATI2 contains the address of the first word of the command list. For those commands not requiring a command list, ATI2 contains information pertinent to the command. ATI1 FUNCTION CODE DEFINITION The following paragraphs provide brief descriptions of the ATI1 function codes as listed above. 1. ACQUIRE TYPE A W O INTERRUPT A type A command list is acquired and processed, the address of the first word of the list being in ATI word 2.IC interrupt is disabled. 2. ACQUIRE TYPE A LIST W INTERRUPT Same as 1, except IC interrupt is enabled. 3. REWIND W O INTERRUPT A rewind is initiated on the transport specified by bits 0 through 2 of ATI word 2, Bit 1 LSB and bit 2 MSB transport address. REWIND COM9tEND ACCEPTED status is stored immediately after initiation of the rewind without an interrupt. The IC interrupt is disabled for rewind complete status. ATI word 2 bits 02 are encoded as shown below for rewind unload commands. BITS TRANSPORT ADDRESS 012 0 1 0 TRANSPORT NO. 1 1 0 0 TRANSPORT NO. 2 1 1 0 TRANSPORT NO. 3 O 0 1 TRANSPORT NO. 4 0 1 1 TRANSPORT NO. 5 1 0 1 TRANSPORT NO. 6 1 1 1 TRANSPORT NO 7 0 0 O TRANSPORT NO. 8 4. REWIND W INTERRUPT Rewind initiation and storage of REWIND COMMAND ACCEPTED status is the same as 3. The controller interrupt is enabled for rewind complete status. 5. iALT PSC W INTERRUPT A HALT PSC command terminates the current input operation in progress and causes input transfers to cease. All previously defined list blocks contained in the PSC list buffer are lost. The PSC list look ahead is set to Zero.Tape motion is stopped in the interblock gap, at which timeHALT STATUS is reported to the CPU. The IC may receive newPSC ATI commands during the time between when the HALT command is issued and HALT STATUS is reported. However, no action is taken on these commands until after the HALTSTATUS is reported. 6. HALT WSC W INTERRUPT A HALT WSC command terminates the current output operation in progress and causes output transfers to cease.All previously defined list blocks contained in the WSC list buffer are lost. The WSC list look ahead is set to ZERO.Tape motion is stopped in the interblock gap, at which timeHALT STATUS is reported to the CPU. The IC may receive new WSC ATI commands during the time between when the HALT command is issued and HALT STATUS is reported. However, no action is taken on these commands until after the HALT STATUS is reported. 7. TEST W INTERRUPT IC activity is checked and reported to the CPU with an interruptive status store cycle. The Indicator Status Word bit 6 is reported on receipt of this command unless theACTIVE controller was busy . Bits 0, 1, and 3 of theIndicator Status Word are used to report IC activity as follows BITS STATUS MEANING 013 0 0 0 No suboontroller busy 0 0 1 The ACTIVE subcontroller did not accept the TEST ATI command bit 6 is not set for this condition o 0 1 0 The WSC controller is busy 1 0 0 The PSC controller is busy 1 1 0 Both WSC and PSC are busy 8. RESET IC ATI FUN 8 This command functions the same as the master reset switch on the CPU front panel.All sections of the IC are unconditionally reset. 9b. ACQUIRE TEST B LIST TYPE B LIST words are used to read seismic scans and convert sample values to IBM excess 64 data representation.TYPE B LIST can be chained only to TYPE C or TYPE D list commands. 9c. ACQUIRE TYPE C LIST TYPE C LIST words are used to search for tape record numbers and conditional read bytes operations. TYPE C LIST can be chained only to TYPE B or TYPE D list commands. 9d. ACQUIRE TYPE D LIST TYPE D LIST words are used to read defined segments or data from a tape record. TYPE D LIST can be chained only toTYPE B or TYPE C list commands. 10. ACQUIRE TYPE F LIST TYPE F LIST words are used to define a seismic startof scan code up to 8 bytes and to set a fixed gain value by which all seismic data channels are to be scaled. 11. SET LIST LOOK AHEAD LIMIT COMMAND This command is used to set the command list look ahead limit counters to a value of from 0 to 14. THere are two of these command counters used for list nesting. One counter controls the number of list look ahead fetches allowed for the PSC controller shown in Fig. 25 and one for the WSC controller shown in Fig. 26. As illustrated in Figure 78, the limit value is contained in ATI2 bits 12 through 15. At bit 12 controls loading the limit value into the WSC or PSC limit counter. A reset command or halt command will preset the limit counters s to zero allowing no list lookahead fetching. In other words, when the limit counters 0, the IC will not accept new ATI commands or fetch the next chainlinked list until the current list operation has executed to completion. Upon successful completion of this command, look ahead limit accepted status is stored in theIC indicator status block. A value of hex F is illegal and indicator status Bit 7 will be reported on receipt of a look ahead limit value of F. 12. REWIND UNLOAD COMMAND A REW UNL is initiated on the transport specified by bits 0 through 2 of ATI word 2. Bit 1 LSB and bit 2 NSB transport address. Rewind command accepted status or rewind busy status is reported in the indicator status word upon acceptance of the command. REWIND COMPLETE status, along with the formatter and transport address bits 11 through 15 are stored in the indicator status word when the transport has reach load point. First, consider Type A, List Word One LW1 1. BIT 0 INDICATOR BIT When Type A list word 1 is acquired by the IC, bit 0 is ignored. However, before acquiring list word 2, list word 1 is stored back in memory by the circuitry of Fig. 27 with bit 0 forced to a logic one. The central memory address at which list word 1 is stored is the same address from which it was acquired. 2. BITS 1, 2 3 SUB COMMAND BITS Bits 1, 2 and 3 are the encoded sub command field and have the significance listed in the table below BIT 1 2 3 COMMAND 0 0 0 Read bytes Cforward or reverse 0 0 1 Read scans forward 0 1 0 Skip block forward or reverse Q 1 1 Skip file forward or reverse 1 0 0 Write 1 0 1 Erase 1 1 0 Write tape mark 1 1 1 Illegal sets NO OP status 3. BIT 4 DIRECTION BIT Bit 4 specifies the direction of tape motion for a read bytes, skip block or skip file command it is ignored for all other commands. 4. BIT 5 FORMAT BIT The format bit specifies the memory format to be utilized for a read scans operation only when scan length checking is also specified. A logic zero indicates that data from tape is to be stored in memory as illustrated in Figure 81. Data bits 0 through 14 of each two byte sample from tape will be stored in bits 0 through 14 of the first memory word of a two word pair. Bit 15 of the first word will be forced to zero and bit 15 from tape will be stored in bit 0 of the second memory word. The remainder of the second word will be forced to zero. This unpacked format can be used to separate the G bit of each data sample in SEG A from the data portion mantissa . A logic one indicates that data from tape is to be stored in memory as illustrated in Figure 82. Because the data is to be packed two bytes per memory word the startof scan code will be stored as three bytes in memory instead of three words as in the unpacked format of Fig. 81. This packed format can be used to read SEG C or SEG A without unpacking the G bit. 5. BIT 6 PE NRZI BIT Bit 6 indicates whether the recorded data is to be phase encoded PE or non return to zero NRZI . A logic zero specifies the NRZI mode and a logic one specifies thePE mode. 6. BIT 7 SEG B, 1600 BPI When bit 7 is a logical one, it allows the IC to ignore Fthe leading zero s in SEG B, 800 BPI or 1600 BPI data records. When the first start of scan code is detected, the controller starts to transfer data to memory. 7. BIT 8 SYNC CHECK BIT Bit 8 indicates whether the scan length checking is to be enabled for a read scans command. A logic zero indicates that scan length checking is not required. A logic one indicates that the scan length checking is to be enabled.Bit 8 has no significance for commands other than the read scans command. 8. BIT 9 NOT USED 9. BIT 10 6250 BPI DENSITY SELECT This bit, if set, over rides bit 6 and indicates to the tape formatter the addressed transport is 6250 BPI. 10. BITS 11, 12, 13 TRANSPORT ADDRESS Bits 11, 12 and 13 are the encoded transport address as listed below BITS 11 12 13 TRANSPORT COMMENT 0 0 1 Transport address 1 o 1 0 O Transport address 2 0 1 1 Transport address 3 1 0 0 Transport address 4 1 0 1 Transport address 5 1 1 0 Transport address 6 1 1 1 1 Transport address 7 0 0 0 Transport address 8 11. BIT 14 NUMBER SYSTEM BIT A 0 One 5 complement data enable sync check 1 Two s complement data inhibit sync check until end of scan . This bit can be used to inhibit sync check when reading SEG A two s complement data or SEG C data. 12. BIT 15 Not Used Now consider List Word 2 LW2 which contains the chain bit and the byte or scan count. 1. BIT 0 CHAIN BIT Bit 0 specifies whether the present list is linked to a succeeding type A list. A logic zero indicates that the list is not linked. A logic one indicates that the IC is to acquire a new list when the current list operation is completed. This process is called chaining and may be continued through as many lists as desirable until a final list with the chain bit a logic zero is acquired. All chaining must be between equal sub commands and in the same tape direction with the exception of the read bytes fprward and the read scans commands. Any violation of this constraint results in a program error status cycle and the tape operation is aborted. BITS 1 THROUGH 15 BYTE SCAN COUNT Bits 1 through 15 specify the scan count for a read scans command or a byte count for a read byte, write and erase commands. This field is ignored for a skip block, skip file, or write tape mark command. The remaining list words are List word 3 specifies the starting buffer address when data transfer is involved. When no data transfer is involved, this word is ignored. List word 4 specifies the link address when the chain bit of list word 2 is a logic one. If chaining is not indicated, this word is acquired but ignored. List word 5 specifies the number of bytes per scan, with a maximum value of 510. Bit 7 is the most significant bit. A value of less than four or an odd number for this field constitutes a program error when a read scans command is performed. Refer back to LWl and specifically to the commands ordered by bits 1, 2 and 3. Following are details of those commands 1. READ BYTES TYPE A In a read bytes operation forward or reverse , data is transferred by bytes from tape to the controller where it is assembled into words for transfer to memory. When an odd number of bytes is involved, the low order half of the last word transferred is loaded with all one s. Regardless of the direction of tape motion, the first byte received is loaded in the high order most significant half of the first data word and the next byte is loaded in the low order least significant half of that word. Succeeding bytes are similarly loaded. The tape will be stopped only in an interblock gap.When a non linked read bytes operation is completed before an interblock gap is detected, final status is not reported until the gap is detected and the controller is busy active until that time. A read bytes operation may be linked to another read bytes operation in the same direction only. A read bytes forward may be linked to a read scans operation either preceeding or succeeding , but may not be linked to any other operation. 2. READ SCANS TYPE A A read scans subcommand initiates a read in the forward direction, with data transfer beginning only after a start of scan code has been detected. Data encountered prior to the start of scan code is not transferred to memory and is not checked for vertical byte parity. Scan length checking may be either enabled or disabled as specified by list word 1, but B. When scan length checking is disabled, data transfer begins only after a start of scan code has been detected, but data transfer is the same as for a read bytes operation, that is, two bytes per memory word. Once an initial start of scan code has been encountered, data transfer continues until the specified number of scans start of scan codes have been detected and read, by the circuitry of Fig. 51, or until an end of record is encountered. The scan count is decremented once each time a start of scan code is detected.Thus, a scan count that has been decremented to zero indicates that the last scan of the list is being read and the list operation will be complete upon detection of another start of scan code or an end of record gap. A read scans operation may be linked to another read scans operation or to a read bytes forward operation either preceeding or succeeding , but may not be linked to any other operation.Tape motion is stopped only in an interblock gap. The direction bit is ignored for a read scans operation. 3. SKIP BLOCK TYPE A In a skip block operation forward or reverse , tape is moved over the next successive record until an interblock gap is detected. A skip block operation may be linked to another skip block operation in the same direction only, and it may not be linked to any other operation. Detection of a tape mark terminates skip block operation with the appropriate status stored and chaining is ignored. Tape motion is stopped only in an interblock gap. 4. SKIP FILE TYPE A In a skip file operation forward or reverse , tape is moved until a tape mark is detected. A skip file operation may be linked to another skip file operation in the same direction only, and it may not be linked to any other operation. Tape motion is stopped only in an interblock gap. 5. WRITE TYPE A In a write operation forward only , data is transferred from memory to the controller where the data words are disassembled into bytes for writing on tape. The left most significant half byte of the data word is written on tape first followed by the byte from the right least significant half of the word. If an odd number of bytes are specified, the least significant half of the last word is ignored. A write operation may be linked only to another write operation. Tape motion is halted only when an interblock gap is detected following termination of the write operation. The direction bit is ignored for a write operation. 6. ERASE TYPE A An erase operation moves tape in the forward direction, erasing a length of tape corresponding to the number of bytes specified by list word 2. An erase operation may be linked only to another erase operation. The direction bit is ignored for an erase operation. 7. WRITE TAPE MARK TYPE A The write tape mark operation moves tape in the forward direction, erases 3.5 inches of tape, and writes a tape mark. A write tape mark operation may be linked only to another write tape mark operation. The direction bit is ignored for a write tape mark operation. The TYPE B command list is used to read and process seismic scans in the following manner Detect the SOS code as defined in the type F list. B Apply fixed gain value to the sample gain values as defined by the type F list. C Convert discrete sample gain data values to IBM excess 64 floating point. D Perform scan length error checking and manintain memory scan boundaries. E Perform input sample data clipping to an assigned maximum gain value. The various bits of list word 1 as shown in. Fig. 79b are defined in the following paragraphs.1. BIT 0 NOT USED 2. BIT 1 INTERRUPT ENABLEWhen IE 1, the IC will issue a CPU interrupt request signal and wait for a CPU interrupt recognized prior to storing interruptive status conditions.3. BIT 2 CHAINBit 2 specifies whether this command list is to be chain linked to a succeeding TYPE B or TYPE C list. C 1 indicates the IC is to acquire a new command list beginning at the central memory address specified by the contents of list word B. When C Or command chaining will cease and data transfer will complete upon the successful execution of the current list command. For type B commands all chaining is between equal subcommands and in the same tape direction. 4. BIT 3 OUTPUT FORMAT This bit specifies the IC floating point output format length OPF 0 32 bit long form format OPF 1 16 bit short form format 5. BIT 4 TAPE DIRECTION This bit specifies the direction of tape motion. Bit 4 0 indicates the forward tape the forward tape motion and bit 4 1 indicates the reverse tape motion. 6. BITS 5 and 6 TAPE DENSITY This binary coded 2 bit field specifies the tape recording format as follows 00 NRZI 800 BPI 01 PE 1600 BPI 10 GCR 6250 BPI 7. BITS 7 10 FORMAT FIELD This binary coded 4 bit field specifies the seismic input format as follows 0000 SEG B This command will result in the SEG B seismic tape samples being converted from a gain millivolt value to an excess 64 signed magnitude floating point value, either long or short form. The long form format is 32 bits 24 bits of fraction and the short form is 16 bits 8 bits of fraction . The converted data samples are stored in central memory in a common blocked floating point format with the seis samples stored prior to the auxiliary channel values in each scan block. A sample exponent clip value may be specified to limit the range of the converted sample values to be stored in central memory. 8. BITS 11 13 TRANSPORT ADDRESS 9. BIT 14 15 TYPE CODE 00 For all TYPE 3 READ SCANS operations, this field must ecual zero. The remaining list words in Fig. 79b are LIST WORD 2 SCAN COUNT LW2 specifies the total number of seismic scans to be processed. A scan length count of zero is an illegal value and will result in command error status. LIST WORD 3 BUFFER ADDRESS LW3 specifies the starting memory addresses to begin data transfer from the IC LIST WORD 4 BYTES PER SCAN COUNT LW4 specifies the number of data bytes expected for each seismic scan read from tape. The IC will expect SOS bytes at this count interval. LIST WORD 5 A BITS 0 3 HEX SAMPLE CLIP VALUE This 4 bit binary encoded field is used to specify a sample value clip point in increments of 24 DB for incoming tape seismic samples. This clip value is applied to the sample value after the sample has been converted to excess 64 floating point. If the converted sample exponent is greater than the specified clip exponent, the clip exponent is substituted in place of the sample exponent and the mantissa is set to full scale.A correspondence between the hex clip encoded field and sample gain decibes and sample exponent base 16 is given below HEX CLIP SAMPLE GAIN CONVERTED SAMPLE VALUE DB VALUE EXPONENT BASE 16 0000 NO CLIP NO CLIP 0001 0 43 0010 24 42 0011 48 41 0100 72 40 0101 96 3F 0110 120 3F 0111 144 3D 1000 168 3C 1010 192 3B 1011 216 3A 1100 240 39 1101 264 38 1110 ILLEGAL ILLEGAL 1111 ILLEGAL ILLEGAL B. BITS 4 15 SAMPLES TO TRANSFER This field represents the number of sample values within each seismic scan to transfer to memory. LIST WORD 6 STARTING SCAN LW6 specifies the starting the starting scan within a seismic event to begin transfer to memory. LIST WORD 7 STARTING SAMPLE LW7 specifies the starting sample within the seismic scan to begin data transfer to memory. LIST WORD 8 NEXT LIST ADDRESS LW8is used by the IC as the starting memory address to acquire the succeeding command list of chaining when specified. The TYPE C command block, shown in Fig. 79c is used or search operations and conditional read bytes. Bits 7 through 10 of LW 1 define the options available for this command.

TYPE E PROCESSOR LIST The Type E list is a general purpose command list provided to allow the user to define IC processor operations via microcoded routines. These operations could include arithmetic, logical, mask, or data manipulation algorithms on as many as four. arrays of data in central memory. LIST WORD BITS 0 2 are functionally the same as described forType B list. 2. BITS 3 10 USER DEFINED 3. BITS 11 14 FUNCTION CODE These bits represent an operation code for one of 16 user defined operations. LIST WORDS 2 7 LW2 7 data may be user defined. LIST WORD 8 LW8 specifies address of next list for chaining operations. TYPE F SOS DEFINITION LIST The TYPE F list, shown in Fig. 79F, is used to define the Byte pattern of the seismic start of scan SOS code.A SOS sequence of up to 8 bytes may be defined for any combination sequence of up to three bytes, the SOS definition sequence must be of the same byte value for SOS detection to be insured. Execution of a TYPE F list is required to define the SOS code for Type B read scans operations.Execution of Type F list for Type A read scans operation is not required. BITS 0 7 SOS MASK This eight bit field is used to enable or disable tape track data to be included in the SOS detection, a logic one enable and a logic 0 don t care. 2. BIT 8 GS This bit specifies the IC to add LWl bits 9 12 to each incoming sample value. These 4 bits represent a fixed gain value NSB 48db, LSB 6db. GS 0 do not apply fixed gain GS 1 apply LWl 9 12 to sample values as fixed gain 3. BITS 13 15 NB This 3 bit binary field specifies the number of bytes to be used in the SOS definition. The central memory address of the SOS definition bytes is contained in LW2. LIST WORD 2 This list word contains the starting central memory address of the SOS byte pattern, two bytes per word. The IC reports status words to the CPU at appropriate times. An interrupt may be issued to the CPU prior to status word storage as defined by the ATI function field or list word one interrupt enable bit and or any special conditions as will be defined herein. Status words are stored by the circuitry of Fig. 32 in central memory locations, the first address of which is defined by IC micro code. The address of the first status location of each status block is restricted to be such that the two low order address bits are logic zeros. The status blocks are shown in Fig. 80. A status store condition may be either Åa non abortive intermediate status condition or an abortive terminating status condition. A non abortive status condition is one which may be reported while an operation is in progress, and does not directly affect or alter the operation. An abortive status condition is a condition which prevents an operation from being initiated a condition which prevents an on going operation from completing or the ending status condition specifying the completion of an operation.In any case, an abortive status storage cycle will indicate either the successful or non successful completion of an operation. A status store condition causes. the IC to determine if interrupt enable is set for the current operation. If interrupts are enabled, the IC will issue a CPU interrupt request and wait for CPU interrupt recognition prior to storing the status block. Several status conditions exist which do not initiate a status store cycle, but are reported only when a status store condition arises. For those status conditions requiring only theINDICATOR STATUS WORD to convey the appropriate status information, the six status words of the PSC and or the WSC status block are not stored. For those terminating conditions requiring a PSC and orWSC status block store cycle, the number of status words stored in central memory is always six plus the IndicatorStatus Word. Status words within the WSC or PSC status block not containing any valid information are stored as zero value. For the non terminating buffer complete status condition pSC or WSC , only the first two words of the PSC or WSC status block are stored along with the IndicatorStatus Word. The IC is capable of storing three 3 types of status block information. These three types are 1 Tape Read Status Block 2 Tape Write Status Block 3 Tape Rewind Unload Status Word Each of the three status block types has a unique beginning central memory address, and status storage for each of the three types is preceeded by an Indicator StatusWord Store cycle. For cases where coincident status block cycles of the three types are requested Tape Read Status storage has higher priority over Tape Write Status Storage, and Tape. Write Status Storage has priority over Rewind UnloadStatus Storage. INDICATOR STATUS WORD The indicator status word is stored at a micro coded central memory location and indicates the following type of information a which status block was stored PSC, WSC, or REW b that the IC could not accept the previous ATI command. c IC executed a HALT command. d IC executed an ATI LookAhead List Limit Command e IC executed a TEST command f IC detected a command priority error g IC received an operation which was not defined Bits 0 2 These three most significant bits identify the type of status block stored by the IC. BIT 0 PSC STATUS BLOCK BIT 1 WSC STATUS BLOCK BIT 2 RrWIND UNLOAD BIT 3 IC ATI BUSY 1 This bit indicates that the IC could not accept the previous ATI command. This bit is interpreted by software as follows a Bit 3 1 and bits 0 and 1 0. For this condition the IC active controller was busy at the time the ATI command was received. b Bit 3 1 and bit 0 or bit 1 1. This condition indicates that the PSC or WSC controller depending on bit 0 and 1 had a LIST BUFFER FULL condition or CHAIN LISTPENDING condition at the time of the ATI command and could not accept the ATI command. BIT 4 LIST LOOK AHEAD LIMIT ACCEPTED STATUS I This bit is stored when the IC accepts a list look ahead limit command. BIT 5 HALT STATUS I This bit is stored when the IC executes a HALT command. This bit is stored when the IC executes a HALT command.Indicator status bits 0 and 1 specify which section PSC orWSC was halted. BIT 6 TEST STATUS BIT 7 COMMAND PARITY ERROR I This bit is set if a DMA parity error is detected on anATI or list word. This bit is abortive causes PSC or WSC section operations to be aborted . Bit 0 or 1 of this status word accompanies this status bit, defining the type of operation PSC WSC on which the command parity error occurred. BIT 8 NO OPERATION DEFINED STATUS I This bit is reported if the ACT controller receives an ATI function, a list look ahead value of hex f, or a TYPE A command function which is not defined. BITS 9 15 NOT USED IC status conditions associated with any operation requiring transfer or monitor of tape read data BATB are reported in the read status block. This status block has a unique microcoded central memory starting address. These operations include READ BYTES READ SCANS SKIP FILE SKIP RECORD SEARCH RECORD NUMBER SOS DEFINITION A read status block, status store cycle is always preceded by a status store cycle with bit 0 of the status type indicator word 1. STATUS WORD ONE READ BLOCK BIT ASSIGNMENT 0 Operation complete tI 1 Transport not ready I 2 Illegal command I 3 Rate error 4 Corrected Tape Read Error 5 Formatter busy I 6 Parity error channel 7 Scan length error 8 BOT I 9 EOT I 10 EOB I 11 EOF J 12 Spare 13 Error status indicator 14 Formatter Error I 15 Buffer complete I Abortive status i Interruptive status cycle Q This status does not initiate a status cycle for storing the status register status word I . Once this status bit is set during an operation, it remains set until a termination status cycle occurs.Thus, it will be stored with any intermediate status prior to and including a terminating status cycle.A detailed description of each bit of status word one follows BIT DEFINITION 0 Operation Complete Bit 0 is stored as a logic one for the following status conditions A When the specified number of b ytes in a non chained list has been successfully transferred for any operation requiring a tape read bytes data transfer. B When the specified number of data scans in a non chained list has been successfully transferred for a type A or type B read scans command operation. C When a type A skip block, or skip ile, operation specified in a non chained list has successfully completed. BIT DEFINITION D When a search record number has successfully completed. E When a SOS definition list has successfully been executed stored in PSC status block F When a PSC RAM down load has been completed 1 Transport Not Ready This status indictor is set any time the IC receives a command other than REWIND UNLOAD and the tape transport is not in an on line ready condition. 2 Illegal Command Bit 2 is stored as a logic one under the following conditions A For a type A list an attempt is made to chain between unlike commands. B A bytes per scan integer field of less than four or an odd number of bytes per scan is specified of a read scans type A or type B operation. C A byte or scan count of zero is specified for an operation requiring the transfer of tape data. D If transport density field of LW1 11. 3 Rate Error Bit 3 is set to a logic one when a controller fails to obtain a memory cycle to transfer a data word between memory and the controller data register in sufficient time to maintain the proper data transfer rate between the controller and the tape formatter. Rate error status is abortive and initiates a terminating status cycle.4 Corrected Tape Read Error This bit is non interperative and non abortive. It accompanies any terminating read tape status condition when the tape formatter unit encountered 1600 BPI or 6250 BPI data track errors but was able to correct these errors on the fly. DEFINITION 5 Formatter Busy This bit is stored if, as the result of an ATI command, the System Read Controller 27 SRC or Write Sequence Controller 26 WSC requests a formatter which is not available for its use. This status is abortive and initiates a terminating status store cycle. 6 Parity Error Channel Bit 6 is set to a logic one whenever a parity error is detected on a data word from central memory. This status is non abortive and does not initiate a status cycle, but is stored only when another status store condition occurs. It is stored with each intermediate status cycle which occurs including a terminating status cycle at which time bit 6 will be cleared.7 Scan Length Error Bit 7 is set to a logic one when a read scans is specified, scan length checking is enabled, and an incorrect scan length is detected. This status is non abortive and does not initiate a status cycle. It will be stored with any intermediate status cycle until and including a terminating status cycle occurs at which time the controller status bit will be cleared.8 Beginning of Tape Bit 8 is set to a logic one when a read byte, skip block or skip file command is initiated in the reverse direction and the beginning of tape is detected. BOT status is abortive and initiates a terminating status cycle. 9 End of Tape Bit 9 is set to a logic one when the end of tape marker is detected while the tape is moving in the forward direction. If EOT status occurs during a read mode operation prior to encountering data read clocks this status will initiate. a status store cycle and an interrupt will be forced. However, if EOT status occurs after encountering data in a read mode operation, this status will be stored only with a terminating status.10 End of Block Bit 10 is set to a logic one when an interblock gap is detected during either a read bytes or read scans operation before the number of bytes or scans specified by the current list has been transferred. The remaining byte or scan count is stored as list word 3. EOB status is abortive and initiates a terminating status cycle to the PSC only. WSC is not affected.11 End of File Bit 11 is set to a logic one when a a tape mark is detected during a read bytes, read scans or a skip block operation. This bit is not set as the result of a skip file operation. EOF status is abortive and initiates a terminating status cycle to the PSC only. WSC is not affected. 13 Error Status Indicator. This bit is stored indicating a formatter or transport error condition as defined by status words 5 and 6. This status is non abortive and will be stored along with any terminating status cycle.14 Formatter Error Status This bit is abortive and initiates a terminating status cycle.15 Buffer Complete Bit 15 is set to a logic one when a linked list is completed successfully provided the tape interrupt is enabled. If the tape interrupt is not enabled, this bit is not set and no status is reported. Buffer complete status is non abortive but initiates a status store cycle.STATUS WORD 2 PRESENT LIST ADDRESSThe second status word contains address of the operation for which the status is being reported, unless the list is to be chained, in which case it contains the link address.STATUS WORD 3 REMAINING BYTE SCAN COUNTStatus word 3 is the byte or scan count remaining when a read bytes or read scans operation terminates prior to completion abortive status cycle . This word will be stored only if a data transfer operation was involved.STATUS WORD 4 PARITY ERROR COUNTStatus word 4 is the count of tape parity errors during a read bytes or a read scans operation by the circuitry ofFig. 49, or during the read after write on a write operation. Each time a tape read data parity error is detected, this count is incremented. The parity error count is reset at the beginning of an operation, but is not reset between chained operations. The final count is stored when a terminating. either normal or abortive status occurs.STATUS WORD 5 ERROR STATUS ONEBIT DESCRIPTION 0 Not compatible.

Sixteen each list blocks can reside in the LBUF 17 for the PSC and WSC and one each in progress of being executed by the PSC and WSC. This capability makes it possible for the programmer to chain together lists to perform functions or to go ahead and issue several ATI commands without having to wait for completion of the previous ATI command. It should be pointed out that this command nesting feature does not have to be used if the programmer wants to wait on the completion of the previous operation. The main programming consideration when using the command nesting feature is that of abortive status conditions arising prior to executing all of the list blocks which have been fetched by the LFC 14 and stored in LBUF 17 If an abortive condition arises other than the normal operation complete status the remaining list residing inLBUF 17 are considered void by the IC. The programmer would have to determine which list commands to send the IC to complete the job sequence.ADDRESSINGTRANSPORT ADDRESS 0, 1, 2 TAO, TA1, TA2 These three lines select the particular transport to be used for operations.

COMMAND AND COMMAND CLOCK The following five command lines and single command clock lines are available to initiate any of 21 commands described below. These commands are acted on only by a selected tape drive that is ready and on line.

FORWARD SPACE FILE FSF This command causes the selected tape drive to move forward past the next file mark and stop. No data is transferred, however, file mark status is reported. WhenEOT is sensed, the formatter acts on interrupt from the tape drive and counts tach pulses to measure tape length pastEOT. The formatter will stop tape motion before the physical end of the tape comes off the fixed reel.REVERSE SPACE FILE RSF This command causes the selected tape drive to move reverse the command causes the selected tape drive to move reverse and stop in front of the next file mark. No data is transferred, however, file mark status is reported. When BOT is sensed, motion stops.FORWARD SPACE BLOCK FSB This command causes the selected tape drive to move forward one block and stop in the interrecord gap. No data is transferred. When EOT is sensed, the formatter acts on an interrupt from the tape drive and counts tach pulses to measure tape length past EOT. THe formatter will stop tape motion before the physical end of tape comes off the fixed reel.REVERSE SPACE BLOCK RSB This command causes the selected tape drive to move reverse one block and stop in the interrecord gap. No data is transferred. When BOT is sensed, tape motion stops. READ FORWARD RDF This command causes the selected tape drive to read the tape in the forward direction transferring data. Applicable drive and error status will be reported.READ REVERSE RDR This command causes the selected tape drive to read the tape in the reverse direction transferring data. Applicable drive and error status is reported.WRITE WRT This command causes the selected tape drive, if not file protected, to write data on tape at the density aelected. A write operation will only occur in the forward direction. Commanding write mode during a reverse or rewinding operation will result in reject status. During write, the data is read and verified in the formatter.However, no data is transferred back to the computer adapter interface. Applicable drive and error status will be reported.REWIND RWD This command causes the selected tape drive to rewind to the load point BOT marker. The drive goes not ready during a rewind operation until BOT is sensed.REWIND UNLOAD RUN This command causes the selected tape drive to rewind to the load point BOT marker and to then perform an unload sequence causing all tape to be wound onto the file reel and if a cartridge is present, cause the cartridge to close. The drive goes to not ready and remains so until operator intervention.WRITE FILE MARK WFM This command causes the selected tape drive to write anANSI compatible file mark at the density selected. Successful completion of this operation is verified by the formatter and status reported to the interface. Other applicable drive and error status is also reported. ERASE THREE INCH GAP ERG This command causes the selected tape drive to erase 3.5 inches of tape in the forward direction and then stop provided the drive is not file protected. No data is transferred, however, applicable drive and error status is reported.ERASE VARIABLE GAP EVG This command causes the selected tape drive to erase the tape in the forward direction, provided the drIve is not file protected. Handshaking and data transfer occurs between IC and formatter as in a standard write operation except that the data transferred is ignored and not written on tape. The length of the erased gap is given by the formula Erased gap length standard IRG N density where N is the number of simulated data byte transfers. This operation is terminated by sending last byte to the F formatter. RESERVE RES This command is operational only when the selected transport has the dual accesS feature installed. This command causes the selected tape drives to be reserved and therefore, not available for use by another formatter. This command will be executed by the drive with dual access only when the drive is at load point BOT . The reserved drive s will indicate reserved status.RELEASE REL This command is operational only when the selected transport has the dual access feature installed. This command causes the selected tape drive to be released if it was reserved, and therefore, available for use by another formatter. This command will be executed by the drive with dual access feature only when the drive is at load point BOT .CLEAR CLR This command resets all previous command and status and causes the formatter transport system to revert to an idle state. If a drive is selected and is performing a motion command or data sequence, that command will be completed prior to clear taking effect. LOOP WRITE TO READ 1 LWRI This command causes data to be transferred through the formatter write and read circuits without going out to the tape drive. No tape motion occurs during this command sequence.LOOP WRITE TO READ 2 LWR2 This command causes write data to be transferred through the formatter to the selected tape drive and back through the read data chain. No tape motion occurs during this command sequence. This command is reset by the clear command.ENABLE DIAGNOSTIC MODE DIA This command causes the selected tape drive to operate under diagnostic mode in conjunction with diagnostic programs stored in the microprogram. This is an offline command unless the system software has been written to support this mode of operation. This command is reset by the clear command.NO OPERATION NOP This command performs no function, but does update status.TRACK IN ERROR TIE This command allows the tape subsystem to perform NRZI data correction using the CRC information. COMMAND CLOCK CCL This single line is used to clock commands, density select, and address into the formatter. This clock pulse is at least 100 nanoseconds wide. The command to be executed must be stable at the rising edge of this pulse and must remain stable for at least 600 ns.STATUS FROM THE FORMATTER TAPE DRIVE SYSTEM The following 21 status lines are available.DATA DENSITY DDS These two lines indicate the density of operation of the selected tape drive.

To illustrate the operation in broad terms, assume nat the activation controller 13 receives tram the central memory with bits 8 11 set as 0010 Rewind Transport N . Activation controller 13, in this instance, will not rsccirl a memory reference from the central memory to be executed by the list fetch controller 14. The appropriate signalsREWXPT 20 22 of Fig. llb are input to inverter array 711 as an input to WSC26, shown in Fig. 54a. The tape address is formed by three lines which are signals WSCTA O 2 Q and the command rewind is signal 00111 shown assignal WSCG D 09 Q, both sets of signals from Figure 54c. Then at Figures 53a and 63b of the formatter selector switch 31, the appropriate se ections are made and the tape is rewound. On the other hand, the ATI word 1 received by the activation controller 13 may have an actual write command, in which case a type A, B, C or D list might be acquired.The address in central memory of the first word of a command list is contained in ATI 2. ATI function 23, 22, 21 fromFigure 15 is sent to the list buffer 17 and to the list fetch controller 14. The list fetch controller receives, among others, signals WSCLPEND Q and WSCATIFLG Q, and provides to the list buffer the signal LFCPSCSEL Q O, indicating that the WSC side of the list buffer is to be used. Then the LFC must get the list from central memory with such list words being found beginning at the address provided in the ATI 2 word. A cycle request from LFC is made through the circuitry of Figures 7a 7c. The fetch is accomplished and the list sent to the list buffer 17 on bus 0 and buses 1 7 of the LFCRIV bus as shown in FIg. 35a 35c. The address selection is made and is stored from the central memory into L BUF at the appropriate addresses as acscmplished. Then the list interpret controller 15, monitoring list buffer 17, upon receiving signal LICLBFGNT Q as shown inFigure 30b, fetches the data from the list buffer and transfers it to the WSC level 1 register 18, shown in Figure 46b. The LIC provides address information to the list buffer as indicated in Figures 35a 35c. The WSC is continually monitoring the level 1 register as shown in Figure 46b.When the WSC is able to take the information, it does so, bringing it in on its left interface vector bus conductors 0 7. The selection of tape transport, the density and the operation is then determined in a manner similar to that indicated for the rewind and the ultimate selection is made through the selector switch to the formatter. If the ATI word indicates that a read operation is to be performed, the list fetch controller again fetches the information at the address indicated in the word ATI 2, sending that information directly to the list buffer, but this time to the PSC half. The information is sent to theSRC level 1 register 19 and PSC level 1 register 20. This time, the system read controller 27 accepts the commands from register 19 and through 2 similar procedure to that of write, selects the appropriate formatter and tape transport. The information then is read back into the data read controller 30 and into the process sequence controller.The process sequence controller, acting under commands fromPSC level 1 register 20 will process the incoming data. A common command list is supplied that causes the PSC 28 to change from one format to another format. The local control of the PSC is accomplished by a ROM. The processed data is then sent into the central memory of the CPU. The condition and interrupt signals described earlier may, at any time, occur. They may or may not require immediate action as indicated above. The signals relating especially to the operation of tape transports are, of course, easily replaced when some other input output device is employed. In the description of this invention, various components were specifically identified. Those skilled in the art are aware that the invention is not limited to any such components and that no such limitation is made or intended.Also, the invention as described in this preferred embodiment utilizes tape transports as the input output devices. The invention is ideally suited, because or its lexz y, to handle any known input output device, including other intelligent cont ollers and CPU s.
