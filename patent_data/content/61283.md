## Description
ANTIVIRAL AGENTS, THEIR PREPARATION AND USE This invention relates to certain deoxyuridine compounds which have antiviral activity. U.K. Patent Specification No. 1,601,020 discloses 5 2 halogeno vinyl 2 deoxyuridines which have antiviral activity selective against herpes virus. Recently, the 3 ,5 diacetate of one of these uridines, E 5 2 bromovinyl 2 deoxyuridine, has been disclosed. 4th International Round Table, University of Antwerp, 4th 6th February 1981, Nucleosides Synthesis of substituted 5 vinyl pyrimidines Barwolff 1 but no antiviral activity has been demonstrated for this compound. We have now found a group of mono and di esters of 5 2 halogenovinyl 2 deoxyuridine which have excellent antiviral activity, and which are useful in the treatment of infections caused by herpes viruses, such as herpes simplex type 1, herpes simplex type 2 and varicella. The esters also have excellent water solubility which makes them particularly useful for formulating pharmaceutical compositions. According to the present invention there is provided an ester of the formula I EMI2.1 in which Y is a halogen atom, preferably a bromine atom each of R1 and R2 is a hydrogen atom or an acyl radical of the formulaEMI2.2 in which X is a C16 alkyl group or a carboxy group of the formulaEMI2.3 in which Z is a branched or straight chain alkylene radical having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms in the chain, with the proviso that R1 and R2 are not simultaneously hydrogen atoms or acetic groups. Preferably, Z represents a CH2 group in which n is from 1 to 4, suitably 2 or 3. When Z is a branched chain alkylene radical, the branching suitable comprises one or more lower alkyl groups, preferably methyl groups attached to carbon atoms in the chain. Examples of such branched radicals are EMI2.4 EMI3.1 When R1 and R2 are simultaneously acyl radicals, the groups in both R1 and R2are preferably simultaneouslyC1 6 alkyl or simultaneouslyEMI3.2 Suitably, when R and R are simultaneously acyl radicals they are identical. Preferred C1 6 alkyl groups for X are methyl, npropyl and n butyl. 3 ,5 Diesters of formula I in which R1 and R2 are simultaneouslyEMI4.1 where X is as defined in formula I , may be prepared by treating a compound of formula II EMI4.2 with an excess of an acylating agent containing theEMI4.3 group. A preferred acylating agent is an acid anhydride of formulaEMI4.4 or an acid chloride of formulaEMI4.5 The reaction is suitably carried out in an anhydrous polar organic solvent, preferably anhydrous pyridine, at room temperature. The product is preferably purified chromatographically by, for example, column chromatography on silica gel. 5 Monoesters of formula I in which R1 is aEMI5.1 group, where X is defined in formula I , and R2 is a hydrogen atom, may also be prepared in a similar manner as the diester preparation described above, but using approximately 1 1 molar ratio of acylating agent to starting compound of formula it . The reaction is suitably carried out in anhydrous pyridine at room temperature, and the product is preferably purified chromatographically on silica gel. 3 Monoesters of formula I in which R2 is anEMI5.2 group, where X is as defined in formula I , andR1 is a hydrogen atom, may be prepared by heating a 5 trityl compound of formula III 1 EMI6.1 in which Y is as defined in formula I , and R2 is an acyl group as defined in formula I , in the presence of an acid. If a strong acid is used, the heating is preferably carried out at a low temperature, and if a weak acid is used, the heating is preferably carried out at a high temperature. A preferred acid is acetic acid. The product may be purified chromatographically, suitably by thick layer chromatography. The compound of formula III may itself be prepared by treating a 5 trityl compound of formula IV EMI7.1 with an acylating agent containing theEMI7.2 group, preferably an acid anhydride of formulaEMI7.3 or an acid chloride of formulaEMI7.4 The reaction conditions are similar to those described above for the preparation of the 3 ,5 diesters and 5 monoesters. The compounds of formulae III and IV are important intermediates in the preparation of the 3 monoesters and are themselves novel compounds which form a further aspect of the present invention. The compounds of formula IV may be prepared by treating a compound of formula II as defined above, with a triphenyl halo methane compound, preferably triphenyl chloromethane. The reaction is suitably carried out in an anhydrous polar organic solvent, preferably at room temperature. The product may be purified by column chromatography on silica gel. The compounds of formula I may be formulated for use in a pharmaceutical composition. Accordingly, in a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a compound of the formula I together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. Compositions which may be given by the oral route may be compounded in the form of syrups, tablets and capsules. When the composition is in the form of a tablet, any pharmaceutical carrier suitable for formulating such solid compositions may be used, for example magnesium stearate, starch, lactose, glucose, rice, flour and chalk. The composition may also be in the form of an ingestible capsule, for example of gelatin, to contain the compound, or in the form of a syrup, a solution or a suspension. Suitable liquid pharmaceutical carriers include ethyl alcohol, glycerine, saline and water to which flavouring or colouring agents may be added to form syrups. The compounds may also be presented with a sterile liquid carrier for injection. The composition may also be formulated for topical application to the skin or eyes. For topical application to the skin, the compounds of the invention may be made up into a cream, lotion or ointment. These formulations may be conventional formulations well known in the art, for example, as described in standard books of pharmaceutics and cosmetics, such as Harry s Cosmeticology published byLeonard Hill Books, and the British Pharmacopaeia. The composition for application to the eyes may be a conventional eye drop composition well known in the art. Preferably, the compositions of this invention are in unit dosage form or in some other form that the patient may administer to himself a single dose. A suitable dosage unit might contain from 50 mg to 1 g of active ingredient, for example 100 to 500 mg. Such doses may be administered 1 to 4 times a day or more usually 2 or 3 times a day. The effective dose of compound depends on the particular compound employed, but is in general in the range of from 1.0 mg kg day to 20 mg kg of body weight per day or more usually 2.0 mg kg day to 10 mg kg day. In a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of treating viral infections in human and non human animals, which comprises administering to the sufferer an effective amount of a compound of formula I .

ANTIVIRAL ACTIVITYIn VitroMethod Vero African Green Monkey Kidney cells were grown to confluence in 6 well multidishes, each well being 3.5 cm in diameter. The cells were incubated with Herpes simplex type 1 virus HFEM strain and overlaid with 0.5 ml of 0.9 agarose w v in maintenance medium containing the test compound at a range of concentrations from 50pg ml in half log dilution steps. The virus infected cultures were then incubated at 370C for 6 days before fixing in 4 formaldehyde solution and staining with carbolfuchsin. The dishes were then examined to find what concentration of test compound causing a 50 reduction in the number of virus plaques formed PDD50 value and the minimum concentration of test compound which killed the cell monolayer, leaving a clear zone devoid of cells and virus plaques MTD .
