# PHTHALIDYLAMMONIUM COMPOUNDS AND THEIR PRODUCTION, AND THEIR USE IN THE PRODUCTION OF 1 PHTHALIDYL 5 FLUOROURACIL DERIVATIVES AND FORMULATIONS CONTAINING SUCH DERIVATIVES

## Abstract
Novel phthalidylammonium compounds IV are inter mediates in a highly selective and high yield process for producing 1 phthalidyl 5 fluorouracil derivatives of formula I which are antitumour agents. The process comprises reacting a phthalidyl compound II with an amine III to yield the quaternary ammonium salts IV , and then reacting the latter with 5 fluorouracil as follows
