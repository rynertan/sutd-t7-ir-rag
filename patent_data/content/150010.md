# CHROMA SCANNING CIRCUIT FOR USE IN BEAM INDEX TYPE COLOR PICTURE REPRODUCING APPARATUS

## Abstract
Disclosed is a chroma scanning circuit used in a beam index type color picture reproducing apparatus, the circuit being provided with an inductance element 74 connected in series to a horizontal deflection coil 74 , and a scanning signal generation circuit 49 connected to a junction 120 between the horizontal deflection coil and the inductance element. The impedance between the junction and the earth at the chroma scanning frequency is increased by the inductance element to thereby make a chroma scanning signal generated from the chroma scanning signal genera tion circuit flow easily in the horizontal deflection coil.
