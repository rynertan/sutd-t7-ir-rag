# 3 Azidocephalosporins as intermediates and novel antibacterial agents.

## Abstract
7 beta Acylamino 3 azido 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid esters are obtained from the corresponding 3 halo or 3 sulfonyloxy 3 cephem esters and an alkali metal azide. The 3 azido compounds as the free acids or salts are antibacterial agents while in esterified form react with alcohols and phenols to provide 2 alkoxy or 2 phenoxy 3 amino 3 cephem esters and isomeric ring explained 4,7 bicyclo beta lactam compounds, namely 2R 2 alpha ,7 alpha ,8 alpha 4 alkoxy or 4 phenoxy 9 oxo 8 acylamino 6 thia 1,3 diazabicyclo 5.2.0 non 3 ene 2 carboxyli c acids and esters and the corresponding 3 alkoxy or 3 phenoxy 1,4 diazabicyclo 5.2.0 non 3 ene 2 carboxylic acids and esters. The products obtained from the azide possess antibacterial properties.
