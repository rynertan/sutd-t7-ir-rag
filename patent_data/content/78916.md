# Shared TOD clock modification bit.

## Abstract
A shared time of day TOD clock modification bit is used in a multiprocessing system in which the facilities in two or more CPUs are implemented as a function of a single TOD clock. This bit helps avoid timer errors that occur as the resuh of one central processing unit CPU changing the TOD clock value while another CPU is executing an instruction which determines a CPU timer value. Whenever the micro code in any one of the CUs reads the TOD clock, it obtains the Shared TOD Clock Modification Bit in addition to the TOD value. This bit indicates ii the TOD clock read operation just completed is the first such operation executed by that CPU since the TOD clock was undated by another CPU sharing the same TOD clock. If it is, certain instructions take action to correct timer errors introDuced by the change in the TOD ciock value.
