# A METHOD OF FORMING A STABLE CHROMOPHORE DERIVED FROM VANYLMANDELIC ACID AND THE USE THEREOF IN THE DETERMINATION OF VANYLMANDELIC ACID

## Abstract
The invention provides a method of forming a stable chromophore derived from vanylmandelic acid characte rised by forming an ethyl acetate extract of a diazo derivative of vanylmandelic acid and adding dimethyl sulphoxide and 2 amino 2 methyl 1 propanol to said extract. The diazo de rivative may be the reaction product of p nitrobenzenediazonium salt and vanylmandelic acid. The invention also includes a method of determining vanylman delic acid characterised by forming a stable chromophore by the above method and quantitatively determining said stable chromophore. The method is particularly useful for the determining of urinary vanylmandelic acid.
