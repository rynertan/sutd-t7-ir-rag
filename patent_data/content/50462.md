## Description
The present invention relates to an extruded, modular panel unit for the construction of wall sections, particularly of light transmitting wall sections such as windows, especially in industrial structures. While the traditional material for windows, glass, has several advantages such as high transmissivity when clean and being easily cleaned when dirty, good weathering properties and a relatively low coefficient of thermal conduction, its disadvantages are, however, numerous and weighty. It is fragile and liable to fracture not only under gross impact, but also spontaneously due to thermal stress, or mechanical stresses caused by warping of thermal expansion or contraction of its metal mounting. Standard window glass cannot be used beyond a certain size unless, at substantial costs, the metal or wood frame is suitably subdivided , and thicker glass is very heavy and quite expensive. Wire reinforced glass, while not as easily smashed as ordinary glass, is not crackproof. Also, single pane windows do not afford sufficient thermal insulation, especially with large glazed surfaces, and double pane windows, that is, windows including an insulative air layer, are very expensive. The so called U glass windows, for instance, consist of one surface constituted by juxtaposed channel sections made of glass, open faces of which sections are overed by another such surface, the wings of which channel sections each penetrate the open faces of the opposite channel sections. While, if properly mounted, this type of glazing is quite effective as thermal insulation, it is also extremely heavy, requires careful sealing and is altogether very expensive. Plastic insulative glazing has also been used. One type, known as Qualex , consists of two extruded,sheets of a plastic material integrally connected by ribs perpendicular with respect to the sheets, producing a plurality of air spaces of a rectangular cross section. However, not only is this type of panel very expensive, partly because of the relatively small enclosed air volume plastic mass ratio, but more important, no provision is made for edge wise joining of two or more panels which, being extrusions, are of a limited width only. DE U 7 716036 Rodeca Schneider discloses an extruded, panel like wall element made of a transparent plastic for insulative glazing. The cross section of this panel is, however, box like and not truss like as in the panel of the present invention, and its structural weakness, which is due to the absence of triangulation in its web design must be compensated for by greater plate and web material thickness, which makes the panel heavier and, thus, more expensive than a thermally equivalent panel according to the preserit invention. A basically similar box type panel is proposed by EP A 0 006 431 Oltmans and suffers from the same drawback. A further disadvantage, common to both of these prior art panels resides in the fact that their respective interlinking elements hooking catch with Rodeca Schneider, groove and tongue joints or snap in joints with Oltmans have to be accommodated within the thickness of their respective panels, which makes these panels relatively thick. Yet another prior art panel DE A 2 125 725 Van Dreyke suffers from the disadvantage that its joining elements groove and tongue type are rigid and located within the thickness of the panel proper. The separate panels cannot be assembled in situ, say, in a window frame or between floor and ceiling, by snapping in elastically deformable joining means, but each panel s tongue must be lengthwise slid into the groove of the adjacent panel. Only than can the thus assembled wall or window be mounted in its intended location. In addition to these, DE A 27 52 286 Lohmann and DE 7045759 Dupree also describe box like panels which can be joined end to end to form wall sections. All of the above mentioned box like prior art panels make use of a male female coupling principle, which principle results in relatively thick panels as mentioned above, prevents removal of a panel positioned in a line of panels without lateral displacement of the others, and gives rise to the other limitations discussed above. DE OS 1 609 777 Rohm describes plastics panels having a truss like structure similar to the one defined in the pre characterising part of claim 1. DE OS 2 243 972 Boussois , DE OS 1 759 662 Reinke and DE 812 130 Ahlmann describe glass or metal panels which are joined together by a joining member. The panels are separated by an elastic element and or the joining member must be lengthways slid over joining flanges of the panels. It is one of the objects of the present invention to overcome these and other disadvantages and drawbacks of the prior art glazing and to provide a glazing which is strong but extremely light weight and, therefore, relatively inexpensive, is practically unbreakable and, having integral air spaces, is inherently thermally insulative. Also, being of a modular design, the panel units according to the invention can be joined edge wise to form windows of any width. This the present invention achieves by providing an extruded modular panel unit for the construction of wall surface portions, especially of light transmitting wall surface portions, comprising at least two sheet like major surfaces interconnected and spaced apart by a plurality of ribs dividing the space delimited by the said major surfaces into a plurality of sub spaces, such that in cross section the said major surfaces and ribs form a truss like structure in which the said major surfaces constitute the chords and the ribs constitute the webs, characterised in that Other features which may optionally be included in embodiments of the present invention are defined in the dependent claims. It is a further advantage of the panel unit according to the invention that, using a different embodiment of the joining members, it is possible to construct double windows which, in addition to the integral air spaces of each panel,in itself, provide an additional insulative air space between the opposite panels of the double window system. The invention will now be described in connection with certain preferred embodiments with reference to the following illustrative figures so that it may be more fully understood. With specific reference now to the figures in detail, it is stressed that the particulars shown are by way of example and for purposes of illustrative discussion of the preferred embodiments of the present invention only and are presented in the cause of providing what is believed to be the most useful and readily understood description of the principles and conceptual aspects of the invention. In this regard, no attempt is made to show structural details of the invention in more detail than is necessary for a fundamental understanding of the invention, the description taken with the drawings making apparent to those skilled in the art how the several forms of the invention may be embodied in practice. In the drawings There is seen in Figure 1 a cross sectional view of a preferred embodiment of the panel unit according to the invention, showing two sheet like major surfaces 2 and 4 interconnected and spaced by a plurality of main ribs 6 and auxiliary ribs 8, which ribs divide the space delimited by the two major surfaces 2 and 4 into a plurality of sub spaces 10. All these elements form a truss like structure of which the two major surfaces 2 and 4 constitute the chords and the ribs 6 and 8 constitute the webs. As can be seen from Figure 1, the main ribs 6 zigzag between the two major surfaces 2 and 4, being attached to them via the short auxiliary ribs 8 which extend from the inflection points of the zigzagging main ribs 6 to the respectively nearest one of the major surfaces 2 or 4. The purpose of this arrangement is to reduce to a minimum the mass of material at the point of attachment of the ribs to the major surfaces, in order to reduce heat bridging between the two major surfaces 2 and 4, and thus enhance the insulative properties of the panel. At the same time, these auxiliary ribs 8 being relatively short, the structural reinforcement effect of the main ribs 6 remains substantially unimpaired. Extending in direction of extrusion, there are provided on both edges of the panel joining flanges 12, projecting in a direction perpendicular to the major surfaces 2 and 4, and having each an outside face 14 designed to contact the outside face 14 see also Figure 2 of the flange 12 of an adjacent panel. The inside face of the flanges 12 is provided with tooth like detent means 16, the precise function of which will become apparent further below. An additional feature of the outside faces 14 of these flanges 12 is a substantially semi circular groove 18 which, in conjunction with a similar groove in the flange 12 of an adjacent panel, constitutes a so called decompression chamber 20 Figure 2 which stops wind action as well as wind enhanced capillary action through the joint. It is of course also possible to use the chamber 20 to accommodate a mechanical seal. While in the preferred embodiment described the outside faces 14 of the flanges 12 are smooth, it is also possible to provide them with serrations extending in the direction of extrusion. This would improve the sealing properties of the joint and also provide a positive alignment during, and additional safety after, the application of the joining member 21. The latter is shown in cross section in Figure 3 and is in the form of a hollow, extruded rail of a basically U shaped cross section comprising a base portion 22 and two wing portions 24. The insides of these wing portions 25 are provided with detent means 26 engageably matching the detent means 16 of the flange inside faces. The joining member 21 is stiffened by reinforcing ribs 28. Joining of the panels is carried out in the following way Two panels to be joined are brought into a position of alignment as shown in Figure 2, after which the joining member 21, facing the paired flanged 12 with its wing side, is pushed over the flanges 12 as far as it will go. It is seen that the detent means 26 and 16 are shaped and oriented in such a way as to facilitate application of the joining member 21 under slight elastic deformation of the elements involved , while offering resistance to the removal of the joining member 21. Figure 4 shows two fully joined panels, with the joining member 21 in the applied position, while Figure 7 schematically shows a window pane comprised of four joined panels. While the above described single pane embodiment gives satisfactory service under most environmental conditions, the maintaining, with a minimum of losses, of particularly high temperature differentials might require still better insulation. Such superior insulation is provided by a double pane window arrangement, using the panels according to the invention, in conjunction with another embodiment of the joining member 21. This embodiment, shown in Figure 5, is in the form of a hollow, extruded rail of a twin U shaped cross section comprising a midportion 30 and two pairs of wing portions, 24 and 24 , one pair of each side of the midportion 30. The detent means 26 on the inside of the wing portions are identical in shape and function to those of the embodiment of Figure 3. Figure 6 shows such a twin joining member 21 in the applied position, while Figure 8 schematically shows a double pane comprised of four pairs of panels. Although in the above described embodiments the angle included between the major surfaces 2 and 4, and the outside faces 14 of the flanges 12 is 90 , the single panels comprising a window surface thus lying in a common plane, embodiments can be envisaged in which this angle will be other than 90 . In cross section, such panel assemblies will therefore describe polygons or parts thereof. Such polygons might even be made to approximate circles or circular arcs, if the width of the single panel is sufficiently small relative to the radius of such a circle of arc. While the panel unit according to the invention is primarily meant to serve for light transmitting wall or roof portions and is therefore designed to be made of a transparent or at least translucent plastic, the special properties of these panels such as their thermal as well as acoustic insulation effect, the ease with which larger panel surfaces are assembled, and their relatively low cost, might suggest their use also for nontransparent walls, partitions, etc. in which case they could of course be made of an opaque material. Figures 9 to 16 illustrate a mounting arrangement for single and double pane units, advantageously used under conditions of heavier winds. There is seen in Figures 9 and 10 a plastic reinforcing rail 40 consisting of a base 42 and two wings 44 and 46, the distance a between which equals the thickness of the panel, which can thus be pushed between the wings 44 and 46. The length of rail 40 equal the width of the panel, including the joining flanges 12 Figure 1 . The wing 44 is shortened, to make room for the flanges 12 as well as for the wing portion 24 of the joining member 21 Figure 3 . At two or three points along the rail 40, rectangular windows 48 are provided, through which special fastening pegs 50 are forced into conveniently located sub spaces 10 Figure 1 of the panel. These pegs 50 consist of a shaft 52 and a base 54 Figures 11 and 12 , and are provided with barb like teeth 56 which make for a secure joint between the rails 50 and the panel, each of which panels is provided with two rails, a bottom rail and a top rail. The full assembled mounting of a single pane window according to the invention is shown in Figure 13. The basic frame 58 is made of an aluminium L profile, having a short leg 60 and a long leg 62, the exterior face of the window being indicated by arrow E. The previously prepared panel and reinforcing rail units are introduced into the frame 58 and, on three sides, held against the short leg 60 of the frame profile by a plurality of special retaining pieces 64, made of steel sheet stamping and riveted to the long frame leg 62 by means of blind rivets 66 see also Figure 17 . It is clearly seen that, along the bottom section of the frame 58, these pieces 64 not only push the rail 40 against the short frame leg 60, but also hold it down against the long leg 62. Different retaining pieces 68 are used on the fourth, top, side of the frame 58. These pieces 68 only press the upper rail 40 against the short leg 60, and do not interfere with a possible vertical motion of the rail 40. This floating feature takes care of the thermal expansion and contraction of the panels. On the exterior face of the window, the gap between the panel surface 2 and the frame leg 60 is sealed by means of a caulking compound 70. Towards the interior, the various mounting and clamping fixtures are covered up by a trimming made of a plastic profile 72 which, as can be seen in Figure 13, snaps over, and is retained by, portions of the retaining pieces 64 and 68. Cutouts must be provided in the horizontal trimming profiles 72 for the joining members 21 to pass. The double pane mounting of Figure 14, its exterior face indicated by arrow E, is fairly analogous in its design, except that the retaining pieces 64 and 68 alternate between a lefthand position 64, 68 and a right hand position 64 , 68 and the trimming 74 is used only on top, aluminium profiles 76 and 78 Figure 16 being used on the other sides. For smaller windows and mild environmental conditions, it is sometimes possible to dispense with the reinforcing rail of the interior panel, which is then held in position merely by the common joining member 21 attached to the exterior panel. In this case, the trimming profile 74 is used also below, the lower edge of the interior panel resting on the inside surface of the shorter leg of the trimming profile 74. A further difference with respect to the single pane embodiment of Figures 13 and 15 can be seen in Figure 18, in which, on the two upright portions of the frame 58, the staggered retaining pieces 64, 64 have been replaced by a continuous U shaped channel profile 80. From the foregoing description, it will be evident to those skilled in the art that the invention is not limited to the details of the foregoing illustrative embodiments and that the present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the scope of the appended claims.
