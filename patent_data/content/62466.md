# Combustible gas detectors.

## Abstract
Combustible gas detectors of the kind in which a heat able wire filament constituting the detector element exhibits a change in resistance occasioned by the change in its tempera ture which occurs due to the oxidation of a combustible gas passing over it usually embed the wire filament in a pellet of ceramic material coated with, or including therewithin, an oxi dation catalyst. Unfortunately non volatile residues such as lead or silicone vapours can poison the catalyst and or ob struct the normal flow of gas to the element s surface, so reducing the sensitivity of the device. The present invention allows the construction of a detec tor pellet having greater resistance to catalyst poisoning, es pecially by silicones, achieving this by building the pellet as a multilayered structure rather like an onion. The invention pro vides a combustible gas detector element comprising a heat able wire filament 10 preferably a helical platinum wire em bedded in a pellet formed overall of an oxidation catalyst pref erably palladium and a porous non catalytic inert carrier there for preferably 75wt alumina, 25wt zeolite , wherein the pel let has a laminated, onion like structure, and consists of a mul tiplicity preferably 6 to 20 of concentric layers in which layers of carrier 11, 13, 15, 17 preferably in pairs alternate with lay ers of catalyst 12, 14, 16 .

## Description
COMBUSTIBLE GAS DETECTORS This invention relates to combustible gas detectors, and concerns more particularly combustible gas detectors of the kind in which a heatable wire filament constituting the detector element exhibits a change in resistance occasioned by the change in its temperature which occurs due to the oxidation of a combustible gas passing over it, the resistance change being utilised to provide an indication of the concentration of the combustible gas. Whilst it is possible to use as the detector element a naked wire filament, it is nowadays more common to use as the element a wire filament which is embedded in a pellet of ceramic material, so providing a more rugged structure, and generally the pellet is coated with, or there is included within the mix from which the pellet is made, an oxidation catalyst which reduces the temperature at which oxidation of the combustible gas takes place. A difficulty which has been experienced with catalytic detectors of this type is that in some circumstances changes in the electrical characteristics of the detector occur in service. These changes are believed to be due to non volatile residues deposited on the surface of the detector element, which residues tend to poison the catalyst and or obstruct the normal flow of gas to the element s surface, so reducing the sensitivity of the device.One such poisonous residue is lead derived from the burning of leaded petroleum spirit vapour , while another is the class of silicones silicon containing compounds analogous to the carbon containing compounds of organic life , and this latter class is becoming a significant problem as the utilisation of silicones increases. One classic use of combustible gas detectors occurs in coal mines, where it is required to detect and measure the level of methane firedamp in the atmosphere unfortunately, the machinery used adjacent the detector may well employ silicone rubber seals and gaskets, and silicone based lubricating oils, and all of these inevitably release silicone vapours into the atmosphere so that the ambient environment is loaded with material poisonous to the detector catalyst. Many attempts have already been made to produce detectors which are unaffected by the more obvious catalyst poisons. For example in the Complete Specification of our British Letters Patent No.1,549,640 I 5958 V we have described how the detector pellet may be given an outer coating of a non catalytic porous material thus, alumina or a zeolite in the CompleteSpecification of our British Letters Patent No.1,554,831 I 6142 V we have described giving the pellet an outer porous layer of a mixture of a zeolite and kaolin and in the Complete Specification of our British Letters PatentNo.1,556,339 I 6076 V we have described making the pellet of a homogenous mixture of catalyst and zeolite optionally with alumina . All these pellets have had improved resistance to poisoning, and yet even so have succumbed sooner than considered desirable. It is the purpose of the present invention to allow the formation of a detector pellet having even greater resistance to catalyst poisoning, especially by silicones, and the invention seeks to achieve this by building the pellet as a multilayered structure rather like an onion. In one aspect, therefore, this invention provides a combustible gas detector element comprising a heatable wire filament embedded in a pellet formed overall of an oxidation catalyst and a porous non catalytic inert carrier therefor, wherein the pellet has a laminated, onion like structure, and consists of a multiplicity of concentric layers in which layers of carrier alternate with layers of catalyst. The detector element of the invention employs a heatable wire filament the electrical resistance of which changes with temperature, such a temperature change occuring when the combustible gas being detected is burnt oxidized in contact with the filament. The filament should accordingly be of a material that exhibits the desired characteristics, and that is in particular relative chemically inert to the combustible gas, its oxidation products, and any likely contaminants. Suitable filament materials and filament structures are well known in the art the preferred one is platinum or one of its alloys, for example a platinum zircona alloy as described in theComplete Specification of our British Patent No.1,567,736 I 6174 V , the filament taking the form of a helical winding. The oxidation catalyst employed with the detector element may be any of those catalysts or mixtures of catalysts used or suggested for use for this purpose.Preferably, however, it is palladium or platinum.As exnlained hereinafter, the catalyst is conveniently employed admixed with some of the carrier material together with one or more refractory oxides. The detector element of the invention uses a noncatalytic inert material with a porous structure as the carrier for the oxidation catalyst. Again, the carrier may be any of those carriers or mixtures of carriers used or suggested for use for this purpose. Preferably, however, it is alumina aluminium oxide , employed in fine up to 10 micrometres powder form, advantageously mixed with a proportion about 25 by weight, say of an acid stable high silica alumina silicate a zeolite such as H mordenite, for example . The detector element pellet of the invention exists as a laminated, or onion like, structure. Thus, it consists of a multiplicity of concentric layers, layers of catalyst conveniently admixed with some carrier material alternating with layers of carrier the term concentric is here used loosely it is not intended to mean that the layers should be truly spherical, or truly concentric, merely that they should approximate to each in so far as they can .There may be any number of layers lamina , provided that they are sufficient in number and thickness fully to cover the detector filament, and provided there is a reasonable minimum number say, two or three of each kind the layers may be of any reasonable thickness and the term alternating is also used loosely, and intended to cover sequences of layers other than that in which the two types strictly alternate so that there may be, for example, two carrier layers between two catalyst layers .Nevertheless, preferably the pellet as a whole has at least 5 layers of which two are catalyst , and conveniently has from 6 to 20 layers with more than 20 layers the pellet tends to be so large relatively speaking that heat loss from its surface distorts the results slightly more of which are carrier than catalyst the carrier layers are from 0.05 t 0.2mm thick, while the catalyst layers are very much thinner about 0.01mm and the layers do alternate so that within the body of the pellet a catalyst layer follows two carrier layers.The final layer that is, the external layer may be either catalyst or carrier the latter is marginally preferred in most cases, but it depends primarily upon the type of heat radiation compensation that is to be employed. A specific preferred detector pellet has 9 layers an inner layer of carrier, followed by 1 of catalyst, 2 of carrier, 1 of catalyst, 2 of carrier, 1 of catalyst, and a final external layer of carrier. Apart from the provision of alternating layers of carrier and catalyst, the detector element pellet of the invention may be made by what is generally one of anyof the standard methods for making detector elementpellets. In particular, it may be made by.the dipping of the filament into a slurry of carrier Cor a solution slurry of catalyst followed by a curing or conditioning heat treatment, this being repeated as many times as is appropriate.Thus, for instance, to produce each carrier layer the filament or pellet so far is dipped into an organic slurry of alumina in a mixture of acetone and methanol, dried, and then heated for a few seconds to about 10000C conveniently using the detector filament as a heating element to cure the carrier slurry layer so formed. The slurry can with advantage also contain various additives, for example a methacrylate binder aluminium nitrate which is converted to crystalline aluminium oxide, further binding the carrier together calcium nitrate thorium nitrate which is converted to the refractory thorium oxide, improving the stability of the carrier and a zeolite such as H mordenite.To produce each desired catalyst layer the pellet so far is dipped into an aqueous acid solution of a suitable salt of the chosen catalyst, and then conditioned by exposing it to air containing a high concentration of some suitable combustible vapour gas which it catalytically oxidises at about 10000C .The catalyst solution can be ammonium chloropalladite in 1 3M aqueous HNO3, preferably containing some thorium nitrate, and the subsequent conditioning can be effected by exposing the dried pellet to a stream of 30 to 40 vol. methane in air, allowing the pellet temperature to reach 10000C, for several minutes. The invention extends, of course, to a detector element of the invention whenever made by such a process. It is not entirely clear why the onion skin layered detector element of the invention should be so much better so much more resistant to poisoning by silicone vapours than earlier elements as, for example, those of our aforementioned Specifications Nos. 1,549,640 or 1,556,339 . Presumably the inert carrier acts as a filter, preventing the relatively large poison molecules from reaching the catalyst disposed further within the pellet, and it seems reasonable to suppose that the layering of the pellet into successive layers of catalyst and carrier serves further to reduce the amount of catalyst that is poisoned.Whatever the explanation, it remains a fact that tests discussed in more detail hereinafter have shown that whereas earlier pelletised detector elements can have their sensitivity to the combustible gas halved in as little as 45 minutes upon exposure to a typical test silicone poison at 5p.p.m, the elements of the invention show a sensitivity drop of less than 5 under the same conditions, which is surely proof of the surprising efficiency of the inventive pellet construction. The detector pellet of the invention will usually be employed in a bridge circuit of the type disclosed in our aforementioned Specifications, and no more need be said about that here, except to point out that the invention extends, of course, to any apparatus for the detecting of combustible gases when employing an inventive detector element pellet. An embodiment of the invention is now described, though only by way of illustration, with reference to the accompanying drawincsin which Figure 1 shows an axial cross section in diagrammatic, not to scale, form of a detector element pellet of the invention Figure 2 shows a cross axial cross section of the same pellet taken on the line II II in Figure 1 Figure 3 is an axial cross section of a conventional holder for a detector element with a side by side compensating element , as used in the Test described hereinafter Figure 4 is a circuit diagram showing the manner in which the detector element is connected up in use and in the Test described hereinafter and Figure 5 is a graph representing the Test Results obtained using the Test described hereinafter. As is more or less self evident from the Figures, the inventive detector element pellet there depicted comprises a helical coil of wire 10 with a multi layer coating made up from the inside of a single carrier layer 11 a catalyst layer the heavy line, 12 a double carrier layer 13 a second single catalyst layer 14 a second double carrier layer 15 a third single catalyst layer 16 and a final external carrier layer 17 nine layers in all.The pellet structure is onion like, layers of carrier alternating with layers of catalyst, each layer being roughly concentric with the pellet as a whole0 The following Example is now given, though also only by way of illustration, to show details of one embodiment of the inventionExample Preparation of an inventive Detector Element pellet A Preparation of the carrier slurp A first organic slurry of alumina carrier combined with organic binder was made by mixing the following ingredients Washed Alumina Powder 10 micrometre 1600gMethacrylate binder DIAKON acrylic polymer 86g Acetone ..................1000ml Methanol........1000ml ...2250ml di Acetone alcohol........ 275ml diButyl phthalate............... 43ml Calcium nitrate Calcium nitrate anhydrous 80.5g Acetone .......................400ml .....15ml Methanol.......................400ml Aluminium nitrate Aluminium nitrate hydrate ....28016g Acetone.............80ml .....10ml Methanol.................... 80ml This slurry was then further admixed with thorium nitrate,H.mordenite and alumina, to make the final, ready for use, carrier slurry, as follows First alumina slurry............... 5ml Thorium nitrate as a saturated 50 50 methanol acetone solution . .lml H. mordenite... ............0.3g Alumina powder 10 micrometre ....0.3gB Preparation of the Catalyst Solution 12. ammonium chloropalladite were dissolved in sufficient 1 3M aqueous nitric acid, the whole being made up to 50mls with more acid. 65g thorium nitrate were dissolved in 40ml water. Equal volumes of the two solutions were then combined to give the desired catalyst solution.C Formation of the Detector Element Pellet A suitable platinum wire about 0005mm diameter coiled into helical form about 15 turns per mm was pelletised in accordance with the invention in the following manner The coil was first dipped into the carrier coating slurry see A above , then removed0 An electric current was passed through the coil sufficient to raise its its temperature to about 1000 C, and the coil was maintained at that temperature in air for 2 seconds, whereupon it was allowed to cool to room temperature.It then bore a coating of fused but porous aluminium oxide about OOlmm thick. The thus coated coil was then dipped into the catalyst solution see B above , removed, and heated to about 1000 C for 2 seconds again, by using the coil as its own heating element so as to decompose the catalyst. It was then placed for conditioning in a stream of 40 ol. methane, 60 vol0 air at ambient temperature and pressure, and left for 5 seconds, during which the catalytic reaction oxidising the methane taking place raised its temperature to about 1000 C. The coil was removed, and allowed to cool it then bore a very thin palladium layer partly diffused into the underlying layer of alumina0 The carrier coating and catalyst coating procedures were then repeated to give the pellet in all a sequence of 9 coatings comprising carrier inner , catalyst, carrier, carrier, catalyst, carrier, carrier, catalyst and carrier outer . The finished pellet was about l.4mm in diameter.The TestA The ApparatusThe inventive detector element pellet made according to the above described procedure was then subjected to an accelerated poison test described hereinafter , being compared with a Prior Art pellet of the simple type consisting of a similar helical platinum wire pelletised in alumina and having an outer layer of palladium mixed with thorium oxide and commercially available fromEnglish Electric Valve CoO Limited as the VQ3 . In each case the element was used in a bridge together with an inactive, compensating element, the two elements being mounted side by side in a standard holder of the type shown in Figure 3 of the accompanying drawings.In this standard holder the detector element 30 and the compensating element 31 are each mounted within a holder 32,33 respectively , secured within bores 34 in the thickened side wall 35 of a pipe 36 through which flows the gas being used in the Test. Each bore 34 communicates with the interior of the pipe 35 but is separated therefrom by a wire gauze filter 37 lining that part of the pipe interior surface. The conductive terminals as 38 of each element are in use connected into a bridge circuit as shown in Figure 4. In the circuit of Figure 4 the detector element 30 is included in one arm of a balanced bridge arrangement consisting of resistors 41,42 of equal value and the compensating element 31. Across the bridge is connected a voltmeter 43 , calibrated to indicate combustible gas concentrations. The meter may be set at zero by the adjustment of the slider on a potentiometer 44 .Terminals as 45 allow the bridge to be connected to a source of power not shown providing both the heating current for the detector element filaments and the voltage of the bridge, Except for the nature of the detector element 30, the arrangement is, in fact, as known per se. In operation the detector element 30 and the canpensating element 31 are exposed to a normal atmosphere, and the slider potentiometer 44 is adjusted to give a zero reading on the meter 430 The two elements are then exposed to the test atmosphere which it is required to monitor. The large poison molecules in the atmosphere tend to remain on or in the outer porous carrier layers ts snd 17, whilst the smaller combustible gas molecules tend to diffuse through to the inner catalyst layers 12 and 1S, to oxidise in the normal way, Naturally, no catalytic oxidation occurs on the surface of the compensating element 7.Relatively, therefore, the temperature of the detector element 30 rises, with a consequent change in its resistance, and the reading of the meter 43 then provides a measure of the concentration of the combustible gas in the test atmosphere0B The Test Atmosphere Each of the two detector elements was first tested with an atmosphere of 1 vol. methane in air at room temperature about 200C to establish a basic value for its sensitivity before poisoning.Each was then subjected to an atmosphere of 5 p.pOm. hexamethyldisiloxane HMDS in air containing 1 vol. methane at room temperature using the apparatus of Figure 3 this Test Atmosphere was driven past the elements at a rate of 500ml per minute and the actual value it gave using the circuit of Figure 4 for the methane content was taken every five minutes and converted into a percentage sensitivity figure, indicating the degree of poisoning, and plotted to give the graphs of Figure 5o Thus, a reading showing an apparent methane content of 0o8 vol. 80 of the true value was converted to an 80 sensitivity value, and so on. HMDS was chosen as the Test silicone poison because it is convenient and representative of the vapours rising from silicone oils and rubbers. 5 pOpOm is a much higher amount than would normally arise, but provides an Accelerated Poisoning Test that correlates fairly well with the results obtainable in a real situation.C The Results The results of the Test are shown graphically inFigure 5. It will immediately be apparent that the detector element of the invention performed very well, losing a mere 5 of its original sensitivity in 45 minutes, while the Prior Art VQ3 device lost as much as 50 in the same time. In a real life situation this could mean that the VQ3 would need replacing every day, while the inventive detector could last for several weeks.
