# Spaced button thrust surface for earth boring bit.

## Abstract
An earth boring bit has thrust surfaces 43, 45 with enhanced cooling features. The bit has a body with three depending bearing pins 13 . A cutter 37 having an axial cavity 39 is mounted on each bearing pin 15 . The bearing pin 15 and the cavity 39 have one or more mating thrust surfaces 21, 23, 43, 45 that are perpendicular to the axis of the bearing pin 15 . These thrust surfaces absorb outward forces that the cutter 39 imposes on the bearing pin 15 . At least one of the thrust surfaces consists of a series of tungsten carbide buttons 25, 27 spaced in a circular array. These buttons have flat ends for engaging the opposite thrust surfaces 43, 45 . The buttons protrude from the supporting metal, allowing cooling fluid to be circulated past to cool the thrust surfaces.
