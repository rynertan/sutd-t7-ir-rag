# Apparatus for producing fibres from thermoplastic material.

## Abstract
Apparatus for converting thermoplastic molten material stream into fibers, particularly to produce mineral wool from molten mineral raw material, combines a slnger cup wheel 13 with a pair of fiberizing rotors 18, 19 . The rotors have each a concavely rounded peripheral groove 20, 21 . The cup wheel is virtually completely surrounded by the two grooves of the rotors so that there is no random spreading of the molten material. All of discrete, fine streams produced by the cup are attenuated by the rotors. As there is no sudden bouncing of the attenuated material, the apparatus pro duces an improved uniformity of the diameter of final fibres and substantially reduces the shot content in the final product. The stress to which the machinery is subjected is also limited.
