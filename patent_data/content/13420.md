# Oxidative coal desulfurization using lime to regenerate alkali metal hydroxide from reaction product.

## Abstract
A process for the removal of pyrite from coal which com prises preparing an aqueous slurry containing finely divided coal particles adding to the slurry an alkali metal hydroxide selected from the group consisting of sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and lithium hydroxide, as well as mix tures thereof, in amounts sufficient to continously maintain the pH of the slurry at a value of below about 8 agitating the slurry while treating the slurry with oxygen or an oxygen containing gas to convert the pyrite in the coal to a soluble alkali metal sulfate reacting lime with the so formed alkali metal sulfate to regenerate the alkali metal hydroxide 12 and then recycling the hydroxide for use in the process.
