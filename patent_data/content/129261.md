# System and device for detecting the deposition of particles.

## Abstract
System for detecting the forming of depot inside a trans port channel for transporting particles in a light transparant carrier fluid, comprising a light transmitter, a light receiver, a bifurcated glass fibre cable of which the joint end is installed within the wall of a transport channel, one branch of said cable fork is coupled to the light transmitter and the other branch is coupled to the light receiver, and the output of said light receiver is connected to a discriminator circuit comprising a convertor for converting the effective ac voltage component in said received signal into a dc voltage component and a comparator in which said dc voltage signal is compared with a predetermined threshold signal, which discriminator circuit is coupled to a visual indicator unit.
