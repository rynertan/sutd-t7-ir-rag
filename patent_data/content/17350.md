# Surgical mask.

## Abstract
It has already been suggested that chronic exposure of humans to nitrous oxide is a potential health hazard. There is especial concern for those working in the vicinity of a patient to whom nitrous oxide is administered as an anaesthetic. The present invention provides a disposable surgical mask characterised in that a layer comprising particles of a molecular sieve based on silicon dioxide and having an affinity for nitrous oxide is disposed between adjacent layers of the mask. Wearing such a mask reduces personal exposure to nitrous oxide.
