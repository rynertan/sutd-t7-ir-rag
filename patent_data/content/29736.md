# Method of diagnosis of operating conditions of bearing and apparatus therefor.

## Abstract
A method of and an apparatus for diagnosis of the operating conditions of a bearing 3 wherein pressures of a film of oil formed on a sliding surface of the bearing journal ling a rotary shaft are detected at a plurality of points 10 on the sliding surface, and the pressure differential between the pressures of the oil film detected at the plurality of points is calculated. The deflection of the bearing with respect to the rotary shaft is calculated based on the calculated oil pressure film pressure differential, so that the operating conditions of the bearing are judged based on the deflection thereof. Bear ing surface layer temperatures and the sounds made by the bearing are also measured and analysed. The bearing condi tion indicated by the lubricant pressure are compared with the conditions indicated by the bearing surface layer temp erature and the bearing sounds.
