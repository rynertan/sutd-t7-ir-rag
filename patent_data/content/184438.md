# Transforming aspergillus niger, and plasmids for use therein.

## Abstract
Transformants of Aspergillus niger and related Aspergil li, containing foreign DNA conferring modified properties of expression thereon, are prepared by use of a DNA vector which contains a selectable marker which is capable of incorporation into the DNA of the host A. niger cells, but which is not to be found in the A. niger cells prior to this transformation. The vector also contains other foreign DNA to be incorporated into the A. niger, for modified expression. The process suitably uses mutants of A. niger as hosts, the mutants lacking the selectable marker as compared with wild type A. niger, and conducts the transformation on spheroplasts of A. niger.
