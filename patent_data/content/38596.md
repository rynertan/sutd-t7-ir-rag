# Removable brush holder with brush clamping device.

## Abstract
A dynamoelectric machine 1 , having brushes which contact the armature contact surface such as commutator 6 or slip rings, is provided with a plurality of independent, indi vidually removable brush holders 10, 100 . Each brush holder is provided with either a removable pin 102 to allow brushes to contact the armature contact surface after the brush holder 10, 100 has been installed, or with a clamping bolt 40 , retaining brushes 8 in a predetermined position for insertion of the brush holder, and removal of the brush holder, the brush holder being tilted or cocked to avoid contact between it and the armature contact surface. Bolting the brush holder 10, 100 into place makes electrical contact between the dynamoelectric machine and the brush holder by means of an insulated, conductive threaded aperture 34 on the exterior surface of the machine, a mounting bolt 24 inserted into this aperture 34 urging a conductive portion 20 of the brush holder into electrical contact. The brush holder 10, 100 may be further provided with a rotatable spring support 212 for varying the pressure exerted on the brushes, and a measuring scale 216 for correlating the length of partially worn brush with an angular position of the spring support, to facilitate adjustment of brush pressure as brushes wear. Angular adjustment of the position of the spring support may also serve to lift certain types of brushes into a retracted position. The disclosed brush pressure adjustment structure is also usable with non removable brush holders.
