# Operation code selected overflow interrupts.

## Abstract
Apparatus is provided which interrupts arithmetic and logical operations defined by a major opcode instruction if the resultant overflows its defined length. Overflow control for a particular arithmetic operation is determined by a sev en bit field within the operation instruction thereby elimi nating a global overflow control mode. One major opcode defines the arithmetic and logical operations between two operands in registers and the result, zero, one, the gener ated condition or first operand is stored in a register.
