# IMPROVED CHANNEL INDUCTOR BLOCK FOR CHANNEL INDUCTION FURNACE AND METHOD OF MAKING SAME

## Abstract
An improved refractory inductor block 20 is provided for channel induction furnaces 2 for melting aluminium comprising a hearth 6 and an inductor 10 . The improve ment comprises casting the refractory inductor block 20 from a refractory resistant to corrosion by molten alumini um comprising 9.5 to 40 wt. calcium aluminate, 0.5 to 10 wt. of a borosilicate frit, and 60 to 90 wt. of an aggre gate consisting of an alumina bearing compound, a silica bearing compound or mixtures thereof. The refractory is cast around a solid core pattern 80 made from a material capable of desolidifying upon the application of heat, such as a wax pttern. The channel core pattern 80 is shaped to provide the desired channels 30 within the refractory in ductor block 20 . After formation of the green refractory, the mold material, such as wax, may be melted off and the re fractory cured by firing at a temperature to from 760 to 871 C. 1400 to 1600 F , preferably about 815.5 C. 1500 F , for from 5 to 20 hours and preferably about 6 hours. To ensure temperature uniformity during firing, the tempera ture is slowly raised from ambient up to the firing tempera ture at a rate of up to 5.6 C. per hour.
