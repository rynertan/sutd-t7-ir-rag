# Rotary actuator.

## Abstract
A rotary actuator for converting electrical energy into rotating torque comprises a stator 1 , a rotor 2 , a pair of annular first piezoelectric elements 5, 6 contracting and expanding in the radial direction in response to the applica tion of an electrical signal, and a plurality of second piezo electric elements 11, 12 disposed between the first piezo electric elements 5, 6 and a holding portion 4 of the stator 1 for causing displacement of the first piezoelectric ele ments in the circumferential direction in response to the application of the electrical signal. These piezoelectric ele ments 5, 6, 11, 12 are alternately energized to continuously rotate the rotor 2 .
