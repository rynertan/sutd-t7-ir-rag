## Description
Title Hand held machine for placing fastener means, such as screws, nails or tacks. The invention relates to a hand held machine for placing fastener means, such as screws, nails or tacks, comprising a body with at least one motor for driving a, preferentially exchangeble tool for placing the fastener means. The know machines of this type have the objection.that the use thereof is limited to one type of fastener means of a fixed length. When different types of fastener means have to be placed, or different length of fastener means of one type, a different machine has to be applied. The object of the invention is providing a hand held machine for placing fastener means, such as screws, nails or tacks, which is universal, so that both fastener means of different type and of different length can be placed by the same one and only machine. The machine according to the invention is characterized in that, the body is subdivided in at least two body parts, which are executed telescopically extendible and retractable, in which between the body parts an exchangeble cassette type magazine for mutually parallel fastener means can be mounted. The invention will now be ellucidated referring to the drawing showing two embodiments of the hand held machine for placing fastener means, Fig. 1 shows a side view of the machine according to the invention. Fig. 2 shows a back view on the machine in the direction of the arrow A in fig. 1. Fig. 3 shows a view from below of the machine in the direction of the arrow B in fig. 1. Fig. 4 shows a cross section over the line IV IV in fig. 1. Fig. 5 shows a cross section over the line V V in fig.1, in which the hand held machine is executed as a screwing machine, that comprises a screw driver and a screw magazine. Fig. 6 shows a part of a same cross section as in fig. 5, in which the machine has been executed, however, as a hand held nailing machine, so that the machine comprises a nail hammer. From figs. 1 3 the outlines of the machine are visible.The machine body has a first front body part 1 and a second rear body part 2, having a hand grip 3. Between the two body parts 1 and 2 is a cassette type magazine 4 for fastener means which lie in the magazine parallel to each other, said fastener means comprising screws 5 in the embodiment. This first body part 1 extends in the second body part 2, and these. body parts 1 and 2 are telescopically extendible and retractable, in order to adapt to fastener means 5 of different length. For the retraction a not shown in detail lock between both house parts 1 and 2 must be released, which is caused by pressing a pressure knob 6. By means of another pressure knob 7 the pressed in pressure knob 6 can be held in the pressed in position, such as generally known with hand drilling machines.With the pressure knob 6 in the present embodiment the machine is not started, however, but it serves only for the length adjustment. The first body part 1 comprises a vertical guide rail 8 for holding the magazine 4 at one side. The second body part 2 is provided with a vertical guide rail 9 serving the same purpose. From fig. 3 appears, how both guide rails 8 and 9 receive the magazine 4 in its width. The magazine width therefor lies in the telescopically alterable lengthdimension of the machine body. The second body part 2 is provided with an arrow 10 to indicate the front side of the machine. The first body part 1 comprises a main switch 11 and an operation switch 12 ans also transport switch 13 for the fastener means 5. Only when the main switch 11 has been operated, the machine is ready for use, so that the screw 5 can be driven at a desired place into a material. In the first, front body part 1 an electrical motor 14 with a ventilator 15 is mounted. The drive shaft 16 of the motor 14 projects outside the body part 1 into the inside of the second body part 2 fig. 5 . On the shaft 16 a gear 17 is unrotatably mounted and furthermore a driven pump part 18 of a rotating piston air pump, which can operate as vacuum pump in the present embodiment. On the non rotatable body 19 of the pump a bellows 20 is connected, which carries a bellow piston 21 at the other end. The latter is provided with an abutment surface 22 and a pressure surface 23. The suction side of the pump 18, 19 is connected to the inside 24 of the bellows 20.The gear 17 is in engagement with a gear 25, which receives an rotatably, but axially slidable screw driver 26. Tc this end the bore of the gear 25 is provided with, for instance, two diametrically opposed adjustment springs, which are slidable in two corresponding, longitudinal grooves 28 of the screw driver 26. The screw driver 26 is surrounded by a screw pressure spring 29, which rests at one end against the first body part 1 and at the other end against the bellows piston 21. The front end of the screw driver 26 lies in a.bore 30 of the first body part 1. The bore 30 connects to a channel 31, of which the width is adapted for receiving the magazine 4 having the greatest possible width. In fig. 5 the magazine 4 with the largest width and the longest possible screw 5 is shown. Both body parts 1 and 2 are then moved away from each other over the greatest distance, so that the greatest machine length is obtained. The first body part 1 comprises a passage 32, which is aligned with the bore 30 and with the screw driver 26. In the passage 32 lie several, spring biased, centering jaws 33, which can be.resiliently moved away from each other by the screw 5 to be driven in, and are adapted for centering and guiding the screw 5 during the screwing inoperation. At the front end of the first body part 1 a hand operable step transport mechanism 34 is present. The latter comprises the already mentioned pressure switch 13, a drive wheel 35 for a belt 36, a pressure spring 37, a control disk 38 and a non rotatable control drum 39. The belt 36 is only schematically shown in figs. 4 and 5. The belt is executed in such a way, that a great number of mutually parallel screws can be held in a row in a bent channel 40 of the magazine 4.Because of this the beSt 36 is connected by a front and back part of each screw 5, such as indicated with dash dot lines in fig. 5. The front head face 41 of the first body part 1 serves as abutment against the relative object, in which the screw 5 has to be driven. The two pressure switches 12 and 13, which projects in a forward direction outside the abutment surfaces 41, are connected in series relative to their way of operation. The switch 13 lying the furthest in the front side, serves for the drive of the step transport mechanism 34, and the switch 13 connected thereafter serves for switching on the electrical motor 14. The magazine 4 comprises at its longitudinal sides an inlet opening 42 and an outlet opening 43 for each screw 5 that has to be removed from the magazine 4, whereas when the magazine 4 is mounted in the machine body 1, 2, both mentioned openings 42 and 43 are aligned with the tool 26. The back side of the second body part 2 is further provided with an adjustment mechanism 44, with which the screw driver 26 can be somewhat adjusted axially with respect to the piston 21. With the mechanism 44 thereby the pressure surface 23 can be adjusted with respect to the abutment surface 22 of the piston 21. This adjustment amounts to only a view millimeters, for which in practice for instance an adjustment post bility of 6 mm has proved to be sufficient. With this adjustment it is possible to adjust the front end of the screw driver 26 over these 6 mm further forward or backward, whereas the rest of the machine is not in operation.This has the purpose of the adaptation to several depths of fastening of the screws 5 in the relative material, so that at a driven in screw the screw head can have a different distance to the front abutment surface 41 of the body part 1. The second embodiment of the machine shown in fig. 6 is adapted for driving in nails, so that instead of the screw driver 26 a nail hammer 45 with piston 46 is applied. Through a conduit 47 a fluid is supplied to the chamber 48, so that the piston 46 with the nail hammer 45 is moved to the right in fig. 6 against the force of a spring 49. Through a not shown slit control with which in the body an outflow opening is present, which is controlled by means of the piston 46, the fluid flows out of the chamber 48, so that the nail hammer 45 is moved by the force of the spring 49 with a blow to the left. The force of the spring 49 can be further enlarged by the fluid, which then presses on the piston 46 from the opposite side. Such a pneumatic blow device, shown in fig. 6, is known per se, so that the controls and switching devices known per se need not to be shown in further detail.The same parts as in the example according to fig. 5 have been provided with the same reference numerals. The blow device shown in fig. 6 can also be used with the machine according to the invention for placing tacks, so that the nail hammer 45 serves as blow pin for the hand tacking machine thfn present. At the shown embodiment according to the figs. 1 5, the width of the magazine 5, measured between the longitudinal sides 50 and 51, determines the relative length of the machine. The magazine 4 fits according to figs. 1 and 3 between the vertical guides 8 and 9. The magazine 4 is therefor slid at right angles with respect to the longitudinal dimension of the machine body between both body parts 1 and 2, and retracted at non use in the opposite direction. According to the width of the magazine 4 both body parts 1 and 2 have been telescopically slid more or less in each other. From figs. 1, 3 and 5 is visible, that at this embodiment the largest width of the magazine is used. This serves for receiving the longest screws 5 of this embodiment. These screws can havea length of for instance 80 mm.When with the machine, for instance screws are used with a length of 9 mm, the magazine 4 can have a corresponding smaller width, so that both body parts 1 and 2 can be engaged in each other over a corresponding distance, so that an essentially shorter machine length is obtained. The screw driver 26 then lies according to fig. 5 with its front part correspondingly deep in the channel 31 of the first body part 1. In the following now the operation will be ellucidated of the machine according to figs. 1 5. After the operation of the main switch 11 the machine is ready for operation. Advantageously at the front side of the machine a non shown sight device if amounted which can be aligned on a place of the wall, in which the screw 5 has to be driven in. The machine is held on the hand grip 3 and pressed against the wall, so that the pressure switch 13 is operated by the wall. This has as a result, that the step transport mechanism 34 according to fig. 5 is operated. The transport wheel 35 is thereby turned so far, that the belt 36, which is transported by this wheel 35 like at a film transport, is transported so far, that the screw 5 lying in the drawing according to fig. 4 upper most in the magazine 4, is transported further downwardly, so that the upper lying screw 5 is aligned with the. openings 42 and 43 in the magazine 4, with which the screw 5 is also aligned with the bore 30 in the body 1.Now there has to be a screw 5 to be driven in present before the screw driver 26 can be brought in the ready position. With the further pressing of the machine against the wall now the switch 12 connected in series behind the switch 13 is operated by the wall. Thereby the electrical motor 14 is switched on. Now the driving in operation of the screw 5 takes place in the not shown wall, against which the machine lies with its first head surface 41.The motor 14 drives through the gear train 1,, 25 the screw driver 26, which is turned thereby. The motor 14 drives however at the same time the vacuum pump 18, 19, so that in the chamber 24 of the bellows 20 a vacuum is created. The piston 21 of the bellows 20 is moved to the left in fig. 5, with which the pressure surface 23 of the piston 21 presses on the back end surface ofuthe screw driver 26. The mechanism 44 is provided with a ball bearing, so that the pressure surface 23 is moved axially and rotates, so that there is no movement with respect to the screw driver 26. The screw driver 26 is as a result of this moved with pneumatic means axially to the left in fig. 5. The screw driver 16 hits the screw 5 and moves this one through the centering claws 33 to the non shown wall, in which the screw 5 is driven in.Dependent on the relative pitch of the screw 5 the axial screwing in distance of the screw 5 per screw turn is different. These different axial distances of the screw 5 are compensated by the pneumatic axial after guiding of the screw driver 26. The machine can be executed in such a way, that the head surface 22 of the piston 21 in fig. 5 can come to abutment with a surface 52 of the body part 1, so that as a result of this a non shown outlet opening is connected with the inner chamber 24 of the bellows 20, so that the vacuum in the chamber 24 is suddenly destroyed and the spring 29 moves the bellows 20 with the piston 21 and the screw driver 26 to the right in fig. 5.The machine is then taken off the wall, so that the pressure switch 12 is released and switches off the motor 14. When one in advertently would directly press in the switch 12 again, then by switching on the motor 14 the screw driver 26 would be moved to the left in fig. 5, but there is no danger for wounds with the machine, as the screw driver 26 do not finds a waiting screw 5, as the first following screw has not yet been transported by the step transport mechanism 34 to the infeed and outfeed openings 42 and 43. When the machine is then taken off the wall completely, the pressure pin 13 is pressed by the spring 37 in the position according to fig. 5, so that only now the transport wheel 35 is ready after the first following pressing in of the pressure switch 13 to transport the belt 36 over a screw pitch. When the machine is now pressed against another place of the, wall, then firstly the pressure switch 13 is operated again, so that a new screw 5 is taken out of the magazine and brought into the position aligned with the screw driver 26 and stands ready for screwing in. When the abutment of the head side 22 of the piston 21 against the head side 52 of the body part 1 determines the place of the point of the screw driver 26 with respect to the front head side 41 on the body 1, then theadjustment mechanism 44 can somewhat adjust this position of the point of the screw driver, for instance with 6 mm. This change of position of the point of the screw driver with respect to the front abutment surface 41 on the body 1 is advantageous, as one can hereby alter the position of the screw head of the screw 5 in the screwed in position with respect to the wall surface. In the shown and described embodiment the width of the magazine 4 is each time adapted to the length of the screws. As a result of this the magazine width determines the relative length of the machine. At another, not shown embodiment of the machine it is however also possible, that only the relative screw length determines the length of the machine. With this other embodiment always the shown, constant magazine with its present, which magazine can also receive the shortest screws. When sliding both body parts 1 and 2 telescopically into each other, the screw driver 26 comes to lie correspondingly deep in the inside 40 of the magazineThen the vertical guide 9 for the magazine 4 has to be sacrificed, so that this magazine is only carried by the body part 1. Furthermore the body part 2 has to be formed in such a way, that it is possible that the magazine 4 is introduced further or less deep into this body part 2.
