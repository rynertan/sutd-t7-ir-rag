# APPARATUS FOR RECORDING FLEXIBLE MAGNETIC DISKS

## Abstract
An apparatus for recording flexible magnetic discs contained in envelopes comprises a mandrel engageable with a central zone of the disk 14 to rotate the disk within the envelope, and a carriage 41 which is movable radially relative to the disk and on which there is mounted a pair of magnetic heads 83, 84 which oppose each other and make contact with the magnetisable surfaces of the disk. A presser pad 96 , which presses the envelope containing the disk against a reference surface 97 of the apparatus, is lowered by an electromagnet 90 which also causes the upper head 84 to lower. When the electromagnet is de energised, a spring 94 retracts the presser pad. A lever 100 biased by a spring 102 is also allowed to retract and lifts off the movable head 84 but only to an extent permitted by an adjustable stop 103 .
