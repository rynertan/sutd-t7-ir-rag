# Electrode for an electrostatic charge injectiondevice.

## Abstract
This invention relates to the fabrication of an improved electrode for an electrostatic atomizing device. The electrode consists of metal oxide metal composite fragments dis persed and bonded in a metallic matrix. The composite fragments contain submicron metallic fibers uniformily arrayed in a nonconducting insulating matrix.
