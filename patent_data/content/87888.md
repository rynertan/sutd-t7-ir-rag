# Method of forming ceramic materials and ceramic products, and ceramic materials and ceramic products formed thereby.

## Abstract
A method of producing a dense ceramic product com prises the steps of mixing a ceramic powder containing a major proportion of an alpha phase substituted silicon nitride obeying the formula M The ceramic powder is preferably produced by effecting a first stage nitriding by heating a powaer mixture compris ing silicon, aluminium alumina and an oxide or nitride of a modifying cation in a nitriding atmosphere at a temperature below the melting point of aluminium until said first stage nitriding is substantially complete effecting a second stage nitriding by heating the first stage nitrided mixture at a temperature below the melting point of silicon whilst maintaining a nitriding atmosphere until the second stage nitriding is substantially complete whereby a friable material is produced and subsequently sintering the comminuted friable product at a temperature between 1650 C and 1900 C whilst maintaining a non oxidising atmosphere to obtain a friable ceramic material including more than 50 by weight of an alpha phase substituted silicon nitride obeying the formula M
