## Description
The present invention relates to heavy duty liquid detergent compositions containing a soil release agent anionic surfactant preferably comprising a sulfonate surfactant and alcohol ethoxylate sulfate surfactant ethoxylated nonionic surfactant an optional quaternary ammonium, amine, amide, or amine oxide surfactant preferably, saturated fatty acid and polycarboxylate builders a neutralization system preferably comprising sodium, potassium and or low levels of alkanolamines and a solvent system preferably comprising ethanol, polyol and water. The compositions are isotropic liquids which provide a high level of detergency performance. There has been considerable demand for liquid detergents capable of providing superior cleaning under a wide variety of laundering conditions. Such compositions generally require a number of ingredients which tend to separate into discrete phases. Isotropic liquid detergents are desired for both consistency of performance and aesthetic reasons. The compositions should remain isotropic during shipping and storage, where temperatures of 55 F 12.8 C or lower are often encountered. They preferably are also formulated to recover, after freezing and thawing, to an isotropic phase prior to consumer use. Liquid detergents desirably contain a soil release agent to enhance performance. However, soil release agents are difficult to incorporate in liquid detergents. Thus, there is a continuing need for the development of an isotropic liquid detergent with a soil release agent capable of providing superior cleaning, bleach compatibility and product stability. European Patent Application 0.095.205, Wertz et al, published November 30, 1983, discloses detergent compositions containing anionic surfactants, quaternary ammonium, amine or amine oxide surfactants, and fatty acids, and formulated to provide a near neutral wash pH. The compositions are preferably liquid detergents which additionally contain ethoxylated nonionic surfactants and polycarboxylate builders. U.S. Patent 4,285,841, Barrat et al, issued August 25, 1981, discloses liquid detergents containing anionic surfactants, nonionic surfactants and from about 8 to about 20 by weight of a fatty acid. The compositions have a pH of from about 6.0 to about 7.5. U.S. Patent 4,287,082, Tolfo et al, issued September 1, 1981, discloses liquid detergents containing saturated fatty acids, enzymes, enzyme accessible calcium and short chain carboxylic acid salts, preferably formates. European Patent Application 85202053.6, Eugene P. Gosselink, filed December 12, 1985 discloses block polyester soil release agents. All of the above patents and applications are incorporated herein by reference. The present invention encompasses heavy duty liquid detergent compositions comprising, by weight Said compositions preferably contain from about 20 to about 40 of a , b , c and d said components being selected to provide an isotropic liquid at 55 F 12.8 C having an initial pH of from about 7.5 to about 9, preferably from about 8.4 to about 8.8, at a concentration of about 10 by weight in water at 68 F 20 C . The liquid detergents of the present invention contain anionic surfactant, preferably a mixture of sulfonate and alcohol ethoxylate sulfate anionic surfactants ethoxylated nonionic surfactant optional quaternary ammonium, amine, amide, and or amine oxide surfactants builders, preferably saturated fatty acid and or, polycarboxylate builders a neutralization system, preferably comprising sodium, potassium and preferably low levels of alkanolamines and a solvent system, preferably comprising ethanol, polyol and or water. The compositions herein are formulated to provide a high level of detergency performance under a wide variety of laundering conditions. Preferred compositions herein are isotropic liquids at 50 F 10 C . They preferably also recover, after freezing and thawing, to an isotropic form by 55 F 12.8 C , more preferably by 50 F 10 C . The present compositions preferably comprise a neutralization system comprising mixed potassium and sodium ions. Complete sodium neutralization tends to cause crystallization of the polycarboxylate builder and poor incorporation of the soil release polymer, whereas all potassium neutralization results in an unacceptably high gel point. The total level of organic and inorganic bases should also be selected to provide a sufficiently high product pH to minimize the level of poorly soluble free fatty acids, without being so high that pH sensitive stain removal, enzyme stability, soil release polymer stability, and greasy oily soil removal are compromised. The compositions also preferably have a solvent system comprising water and a mixture of ethanol and polyol. Polyols such as propylene glycol are especially good at solubilizing the soil release polymer. Crystallization occurs without the polyol and unacceptably high gel points tend to occur without the ethanol. The amount of ethanol and polyol must also be sufficient to prevent organic phase separation i.e., keep free fatty acids and poorly soluble surfactants in solution , and yet not be so high as to cause lye phase separation and or crystallization by limiting the amount of water available. The soil release component has the generic formula The R¹ moieties are essentially 1,4 phenylene moieties. As used herein, the term the R¹ moieties are essentially 1,4 phenylene moieties refers to compounds where the R¹ moieties consist entirely of 1,4 phenylene moieties, or are partially substituted with other arylene or alkarylene moieties, alkylene moieties, alkenylene moieties, or mixtures thereof. Arylene and alkarylene moieties which can be partially substituted for 1,4 phenylene include 1,3 phenylene, 1,2 phenylene, 1,8 naphthylene, 1,4 naphthylene, 2,2 biphenylene, 4,4 biphenylene and mixtures thereof. Alkylene and alkenylene moieties which can be partially substituted include ethylene, 1,2 propylene, 1,4 butylene, 1,5 pentylene, 1,6 hexamethylene, 1,7 heptamethylene, 1,8 octamethylene, 1,4 cyclohexylene, and mixtures thereof. For the R¹ moieties, the degree of partial substitution with moieties other than 1,4 phenylene should be such that the soil release properties of the compound are not adversely affected to any great extent. Generally, the degree of partial substitution which can be tolerated will depend upon the backbone length of the compound, i.e., longer backbones can have greater partial substitution for 1,4 phenylene moieties. Usually, compounds where the R¹ comprise from about 50 to 100 1,4 phenylene moieties from 0 to about 50 moieties other than 1,4 phenylene have adequate soil release activity. For example, polyesters made according to the present invention with a 40 60 mole ratio of isophthalic 1,3 phenylene to terephthalic 1,4 phenylene acid have adequate soil release activity. However, because most polyesters used in fiber making comprise ethylene terephthalate units, it is usually desirable to minimize the degree of partial substitution with moieties other than 1,4 phenylene for best soil release activity. Preferably, the R¹ moieties consist entirely of i.e., comprise 100 1,4 phenylene moieties, i.e. each R¹ moiety is 1,4 phenylene. For the R² moieties, suitable ethylene or substituted ethylene moieties include ethylene, 1,2 propylene, 1,2 butylene, 1,2 hexylene, 3 methoxy 1,2 propylene and mixtures thereof. Preferably, the R² moieties are essentially ethylene moieties, or, preferably, 1,2 propylene moieties or mixtures thereof. Although inclusion of a greater percentage of ethylene moieties tends to improve the soil release activity of the compounds, the percentage included is limited by water solubility. Surprisingly, inclusion of a greater percentage of 1,2 propylene moieties tends to improve the water solubility of the compounds and consequently the ability to formulate isotropic aqueous detergent compositions without significantly harming soil release activity. For this invention, the use of 1,2 propylene moieties or a similar branched equivalent is extremely important for maximizing incorporation of a substantial percentage of the soil release component in the heavy duty liquid detergent compositions. Preferably, from about 75 to about 100 , more preferably from about 90 to about 100 of the R² moieties are 1,2 propylene moieties. In general, soil release components which are soluble in cool 15 C ethanol are also useful in compositions of the invention. The value for n averages at least about 10, but a distribution of n values is present. The value for each n usually ranges from about 10 to about 50. Preferably, the value for each n averages in the range of from about 10 to about 25. A preferred process for making the soil release component comprises the step of extracting a polymer having a typical distribution in which a substantial portion comprises a material in which u is equal to or greater than 6 with essentially anhydrous ethanol at low temperatures, e.g. from about 10 C to about 15 C, preferably less than about 13 C. The ethanol soluble fraction is substantially free of the longer polymers and is much easier to incorporate into isotropic heavy duty liquids, especially those with higher builder levels. Although the polymers wherein u is less than about 3 are essentially of no value in providing soil release effects, they can be more easily incorporated than higher u values. A more preferred process for making the soil release component is by direct synthesis. A more comprehensive disclosure of the soil release component and methods for making it can be found in European Patent Application 85202053.6, filed December 12, 1985, by Eugene P. Gosselink, incorporated herein by reference.

A more complete disclosure of suitable enzymes can be found in U.S. Patent 4,101,457, Place et al, issued July 18, 1978, incorporated herein by reference. When enzymes are incorporated in the detergent compositions of this invention, they are desirably stabilized by using a mixture of a short chain carboxylic acid salt and calcium ion, such as disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,318,818, Letton et al, issued March 9, 1982, incorporated herein by reference.

When materials are present which complex calcium ion, it is necessary to use high levels of calcium ion so that there is always some minimum level available for the enzyme. Enzymes are preferably stabilized in the present compositions by the addition of from about 0.25 to about 10 , preferably from about 0.5 to about 5 , more preferably from about 0.75 to about 3 , by weight of boric acid or a compound capable of forming boric acid in the composition calculated on the basis of the boric acid . Boric acid is preferred, although other compounds such as boric oxide, borax and other alkali metal borates e.g., sodium ortho , meta and pyroborate, and sodium pentaborate are suitable. Substituted boric acids e.g., phenylboronic acid, butane boronic acid, and p bromo phenylboronic acid can also be used in place of boric acid. The combination of boric acid and formate provides improved protease stability, although amylase stability appears to be slightly less than that obtained using boric acid alone. Preferred compositions also contain from about 0.01 to about 1 of a polyacid or salt thereof, to enhance pretreatment performance. Preferred polyacids for use herein are ethylenediamine tetramethylenephosphonic acid, diethylene triamine pentamethylenephosphonic acid, and diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid, or the salts thereof. These polyacids salts are preferably used in an amount from about 0.1 to about 0.8 .
