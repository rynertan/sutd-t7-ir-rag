# COEFFICIENT OF PERFORMANCE MEASURING DEVICE

## Abstract
The device is used to measure the COP of a mechanical vapor compression system and includes a power transducer 31 to measure the power to the compressor motor 11 , tem perature sensors 43, 48, 46, 45 to measure respectively tem peratures of the inlet 14 and outlet 13 of the compressor 12 and the inlet 17 and outlet 21 of a fluid expansion means 20 , and a microprocessor 62 to store losses typical of the motor, to store the pressure versus enthalpy characteris tics of the system under test, to store the temperature versus entropy characteristics of the system and to receive output sig nals of the temperature sensors, the microprocessor being operable to continuously determine the COP for the system as the system is operating.
