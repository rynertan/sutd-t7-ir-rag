# Bis halophenyl hexafluoropropanes and process for making the same.

## Abstract
A new process for preparing diphenyl derivatives of he xafluoropropane containing halogen substituents on the phenyl rings and new halogen substituted diphenyl deriva tives of hexafluoropropane prepared thereby are disclosed. The new compounds of this invention are useful as interme diates for the synthesis of high temperature polymer systems.
