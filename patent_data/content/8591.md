# Detergent additives for lubricants and fuels, compositions and use thereof.

## Abstract
Vegetable oils such as corn oil, peanutoil, and soy oil are reacted with polyamines to form a mixture containing amides, imides, half esters, and glycerol. This mixture and the product obtained by subsequent treatment of this mixture with a strong acid such as sulfonic acid are product mixes that have good detergent properties in fuels and lubricants.
