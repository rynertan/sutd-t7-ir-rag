# Method of forming stabilized coal oil mixtures.

## Abstract
Stabilized coal oil mixtures are obtained by mixing pulver ised coal particles with oil and a surface treating mixture com prising an organic monomer and a free radical catalyst and in itiator, heating the mixture so formed first under conditions of low shear and then under high shear, and finally adding a gel ling agent to the mixture to form the mixture into a thixotropic gel or paste. Preferably the coal particles are initially washed and rendered hydrophobic and oleophilic by an initial treat ment in an aqueous medium comprising organic monomer, a polymerisation catalyst and initiator and an organic liquid car rier.
