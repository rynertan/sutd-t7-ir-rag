# Microwave generated plasma light source apparatus.

## Abstract
The apparatus includes a microwave generator 1, 2 which is connected through a feeder 3, 5 to cavity 49 defined by a light reflecting member 4 and a member 9 which is transparent to light but opaque to microwaves. An electrodeless discharge bulb 6 contains substance for dis charge light emission and is located in the cavity 49 so that the latter operates resonantly when the bulb 6 is emitting light. The bulb is sufficiently small as to provide, effectively, a point light source.
