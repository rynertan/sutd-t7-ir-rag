# CABLE CORROSION MONITOR

## Abstract
A metal cable corrosion monitor comprises a sensing head 14 located about a multi strand cable 1 . The sensing head includes a field windings 3 for applying a magnetic field coaxially to a portion of the cable to be monitored. A pick up coil 2 encircles the portion and detects magnetic flux parallel with the cable and linking with the area of the pick up coil. The signals from the pick up coil are processed by a high gain amplifier 8 and phase sensitive detectors 7 and 6 , the former phase sensitive detector producing an output in phase with the field winding driving frequency and the latter phase sensitive detector producing a quadruture output relative to the field winding driving frequency. By observation of the amplitude and the phase output parameters it is possible to detect corrosion of a single or multi strand cable. A particular format of field winding is disclosed whereby the effects of induced inter strand currents can be reduced.
