# Arrangement in climatization systems.

## Abstract
In a climatization system the influence of the outside air temperature 28 is fed to a comparator 26 which is also fed with a comparation voltage, successively variable during the starting time and obtained from a pulse generator 10 of variable pulse time relation, and the climatization process is started at balancy between the two voltages.
