# A SEALING RING FOR AN ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR

## Abstract
This invention provides an improved moisture seal for an electrical connector assembly. The invention is characterized by an annular rubber member 10 having generally flat sur faces 11, 12, 13, 14 and an annular groove 15 in one of the surfaces 11 that abuts against a forward surface of one of the housings 30 . A second groove 16 extending radially from the annular groove 15 to a circumferential surface 14 pro vides an escape path for air that would normally be trapped in the annular groove 15 when the sealing member 10 is compressed.
