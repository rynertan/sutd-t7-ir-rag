# Improved covering power in films.

## Abstract
A silver halide gelatin light sensitive emulsion containing a saturated cyclic oxime compound, and optionally containing a di or tri methylol lower alkane compound is disclosed. The saturated cyclic oxime compound significantly increases the covering power of the silver in the silver halide emulsion and thereby allows for a decrease in the amount of silver used. In cluding a di or tri methylol lower alkane compound in the emulsion reduces or prevents the generation of fog during coating and fast drying of the emulsion. The light sensitive emulsion coated on a substrate is particularly useful as a radiographic film.
