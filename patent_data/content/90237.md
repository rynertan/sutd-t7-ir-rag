## Description
ELECTRONIC VOLTAGE CONTROL DEUCE This invention relates to an electronic voltage control device. Known and commercially available are devices for controlling the voltage across a load, wherein an electric circuit,to which a non constant input DC voltage is applied,delivers a regulated output DC voltage. In particular, known is a circuit comprising an active element controlled by a hysteresis comparator, an output filter, and an inductor which is operative to control the input average current, That circuit has a transfer function of the first order, the single pole whereof is only provided by the capacitor of the output filter. Consequently, the circuit operates as a driven current source feeding the load. The advantage of said circuit over other conventional ones is that it is quite stable, on account of its transfer function of the first order. However, said prior device has the disadvantage that it is not possible to adjust thereby the switch over rate of the active element. Several attempts have been made by The ilicant to solve this problem, e.g. by sending synchronization pulps to tbs input of the hysteresis comparator to cause it to switch over at preset moments in time. However, this solution has failed to prove adequate because the behavior of frequency versus input voltage as shown in Figure 12 is parabolic, thereby a complicated synchronization circuit is required which can discriminate whether the voltage is higher or lower than one half of the output voltage, and hence supply pulses with a different sign. Moreover, even in this case, there would be left an indecision range on either sides of the peak value, whereby the circuit is no longer fully reliable.Another disadvantage of this solution is that the inductive impedence present in the regulating circuit begins to make itself felt, so that the transfer function of the system becomes of the second order and the desired stability feature is lost. Accordingly, the task of the invention is to provide an electronic voltage control device which , while having a transfer function of the first order, is also effective to afford the possibility of controlling or adjusting the switch over rate of the active element. Within that task it is a primary object of the invention to provide such an electronic voltage control device of high reliable operation, and, in particular, effective to be easily synchronized. It is a further object of the invention to provide such a control device, which can be made by using integrated and solid state power components of low cost and readily available on the market. According to one aspect of the invention the above task and objects are achieved by an electronic voltage control device comprising a load average current controlling stage including a current sensor, an induct ance, and a hysteresis comparator arranged downstream of ai cement sensor and re caLving at one input thereof a signal an an error amplifier, as well as an active switch over element located downstream of and being controlled by said comparator, and an output filter, characterized in that it ftuther comprises a control stage controlling the switch over rate of said active element, said control stage operating with a constant average cu ent and being located upstream of said hysteresis comparator. Further features and advantages of the invention will be more clearly apparent from the following description of a preferred, though not limitative, embodiment of this device, with reference to the accompanying illustrative drawings, where Figure 1 is a schematic circuit diagram of a voltage controller according to a conventional design Figures 2 and 3 show two time graphs of electric signals pertaining to the circuit of Figure 1 Figure 4 is a general block diagram representation of the voltage controller according to the invention Figure 5 is a detailed wiring diagram of the inventive voltage controller Figures 6 to 11 show time graphs of electric signals pertaining to the circuit of Figure 5 and Figure 12 illustrates the behavior of frequency versus input voltage of the known current control stage as included in the voltage controller according to the the invention. Making reference to Figure 1, there is shown there a circuit diagram of a prior device having a transfer function of the first order. This circuit comprises essentially a current sensor 1, an inductor L located downstream of said sensor, a diode 3, a comparator 4 to the input whereof the signal from said sensor 1 is applied, and an error operational amplifier 6. Downstream of said comparator 4, an active switchover element transistor 5 is provided which is controlled by the signal from the comparator 4. The circuit further includes an output filter comprising a capacitor 7 and resistors 8.To one input of the error amplifier 6, there is applied a signal proportional to the output voltage, as taken at the resistors 8 connection point, while to the other input of said amplifier 6 a reference signal Vr is applied, as it is conventional, in such a way that the operational amplifier 6 supplies the hysteresis comparator 4 with a voltage which is proportional to the difference between the two input voltages. The mode of operation of the above conventional device will be presently discussed herein below. The sensor 1 supplies, to the input of the comparator 4, a voltage Vs which is proportional to the current through the inductance L, which, as shown in Figure 2 and better explained hereinafter, is triangular with a gradient determined by the value of said inductance L. Supplied to the input of the comparator 4 is the error voltage Ye which is proportional to the difference between the load voltage and a reference voltage Vr. As Vs increases to Ve, the comparator output is negative and the transistor 5 is switched off, whereas as Vs, on the falling edge, becomes equal to Ve, the comparator output voltage becomes positive and switches on the transistor 5.Thus, the output voltage Vc of the comparator is a square wave with a frequency vannag with the twat voltage. Accordingly, the output voltage is regulated by controlling the transconductance, i.e. the average input current.This circuit does not allow, however, frequency regulation and constant frequency operation. For a better understanding of the principle of this invention, reference may be had to Figure 3, which shows the current flowing through the inductance L. Given thatEMI5.1 and, therefore,EMI5.2 it being, Al 1M 1m the frequency is inversely proportional to the current hysteresis ZI, Consequently, by regulating the latter, the switch over rate of the transistor 5 is also regulated. For the voltage regulation loop not to interact with the frequency control loop, it is necessary that control of the hysteresis current Al be effected without the average input current IAV undergoing any change. In that event, the system transfer function would no longer be, in fact, of the first order.SinceEMI6.1 we obtain thatEMI6.2 and therefore, if the average current IAV, as controlled by the voltage regulation loop, is added and substracted, respectively at each switch over,with the term I 2, under control by the frequency loop, the two control loops will not interact and the circuit can operate as a constant frequency voltage controller, because of the tripping thresholds of 1M and I of the comparator m being adjusted differentially with respect to the average value. Figure 4 illustrates a blodc diagram of the improved circuit according to the invention operating on the principle just explained. Th Figure,the ceceed bop circuit for regulating the mean current comprising a sensor 1 , inductor L , diode 3 , hysteresis comparator 4 , transistor 5 , error amplifier 6 , capacitor 7 and resistors 8 , which operate similarly to the corresponding components of the circuit of Figure 1 has been added a closed loop circuit for regulating the frequency such as not to interfere with the first loop.That closed frequency regulating loop includes a phase comparator 9, which compares the signal at the base of the transistor 5 to a synchronization signal, a block 10 which detects the sign of the output signal from the comparator 4 and multiplies it by the output signal from the phase comparator 9, and an adder block 11 which adds the signal from the sensor 1 to the signal from the block 10 and feeds the hysteresis comparator 4 . In practice, therefore, by measuring the phase displacement, between the signal from the hysteresis comparator 4 and a suitable external signal Vsy, it becomes possible to obtain, at the output of the phase comparator 9, a signal having such an amplitude as to supply the desired frequency in accordance with the above formulae, whilst the block 10 multiplies said signal by the sign of the hysteresis comparator 4 output voltage, thereby said signal is alternately added to and substracted from the current supplied by the sensor 1 . Thus, regulation of the frequency is achieved without changing, within one period length, the current passed to the input of the average current regulating stage, the operation whereof is, hence, unaffected by the frequency regulating stage. Shonvn in Figure 5 is a complete circuit diagram of the voltage control device according to the invention, wherein the resistors R12, R15, R16, R17,R18, and R19, capacitor CR6, and transistors Q3 andQ5 make up the block 1 the diode CR7 corresponds to the diode 3 of Figure 4 the comparator U3 and resistor R21 make up the block 4 of the hysteresis comparator the resistor R26 and transistors Q6 Q8 correspond to the transistor 5 of Figure 4 the resistors R20,R22,R23, Zener diode VR1, capacitor C2, and operational amplifier U4 form the block 6 the capacitor C3 correspond to 7 of Figure 4 resistorsR27 and R24,R25 correspond to resistors 8 of Figure 4 the resistor R6, capacitor C1 and PLL PhaseLocked Loop U1 make up the block 9 the resistorsR1 R5, R7 R11, diodes CR1 CR5, transistors Q1,Q2 andQ4, and inverters US and U6 make up the block 10 and the resistors R13 and R14 form the block 11. The frequency control stage of the above circuit operates as follows. It is first assumed that the transistor Q7 is saturated, in which case the current through the inductor L would grow linearly according to the relationshipEMI8.1 where Ilo is the initial current value in the inductance L at the time whereat Q7 is turned on saturated . In that condition, the voltage VG is high, so that the output of U6 is high and that of US at a low. Consequently, through the diode CR1, the transistor Q1 is turned off, as is Q2, which will supply no current to the resistor R130 The output ofU6 being at a high, the diode CR5 will apply no blocking on the base of Q4 which, being driven by the output voltage of U2, has an emitter current which is proportional to that voltage base resistance, R7, and R5 produce a very low drop, having the sole function of uncoupling the bases of the two transistors owing to the feedback resistor R11 of the emitter. Given that the collector current ofQ4fs virtually equal to that of the emitter neglecting base current , a current flows through the collector of Q4 which is substracted, at the knot S , from that supplied from the collector left hand side of Q3. Accordingly, voltage at the point S is given by the product of total resistance RTOT R13 R14 by the total current 1TOT IC3 AI 2. And since the current Ic3 is proportional to the current IL through the inductor, we obtainEMI9.1 having the waveform shown in Figure 3 at the first period portion at1. When, on the contrary, Q7 is turned off At2 , the current It through the inductor Lt decreases linearly in accordance with the following law,EMI9.2 In such conditions, VG is low, the output ofU6 is also low, the output of US high, and hence, through the diode CR5, it is the transistor Q4 which is off, whereas Q1, being uncoupled from the output ofUS through CR1, is free to conduct an emitter current which is directly proportional to the output voltage of U2 and inversely proportional to the resistance ofR9 since R9 and R11 have been selected to have the same value, the emitter current of Q1in its conductive state is equal to the current of Q4 while the latter is conductive, at the first period portion At1. Q1 being conductive, also conductive is Q2 which has a collector current set to be equal to the collector current of QI passed to the knot S to add itself to the current from the collector of Q3 left hand side . The final waveform is that shown in Figure 3 at the second period portion 8 2 In conclusion, this circuit allows the adding and substracting, alternately during At1 andnt respectively, a current supplement which creates hysteresis at the comparator U3. The frequency being, as mentioned, inversely proportional to that hysteresis, by regulating that hysteresis the frequency may be regulated. The hysteresis current no 2, as algebraically added in the knot S , is proportional, as mentioned, to the output voltage of U2, i.e.EMI10.1 where VRf is the fixed reference voltage set by R1 and R2 and is isthe average value of the voltage Vp as filtered by R6 and C1. The synchronization frequency being slightly higher than the peak free running frequency of the circuit, from the increase of the frequency error f f f sy boost it may be concluded that the boosting frequency has decreased as a result, the voltage Vpm increases, voltage V1 decreases, the hysteresis current ss I 2 decreases, and frequency is forced to increase. This last occurrence is important synchronization can only take place at a frequency which is higher than the boost free running highest frequency seeFigure 12 . In fact, if the synchronization frequency is selected to be lower than the peak frequency f , max with Vin V0 2, the frequency error would increase, causing Vpm to increase, V1 andAl to decrease, so that the switching rate would be again forced to increase instead of decreasing in essence, a positive rather than a negative feedback loop would be the net result. Figure 5 shows the main circuit points wherefrom fflhere are derived the electrical signals the behaviour with time whereof is illustrated , for different values of the input voltage, in Figure 8 6 11 not to a common scale , It will be appreciated from the foregoing description that the electronic voltage control device of this invention fully achieves its objects. In particular, a circuit is provided, whereby it becomes possible to control, besides the output voltage, also the switching rate, while retaining a transfer function of the first order, thanks to the frequency control closed loop and average current control closed loop not interacting with each other and operating independently of each other. Advantageous is also the utilization of commercially readily available components, which enables the cost of the inventive device to be kept within acceptable limits. The invention as described is susceptible of many modifications and variations, without departing from the scope of the instant inventive concept. Furthermore, all of the details may be replaced with other technically equivalent elements.
