## Abstract
In a method for emphasizing sharpness in picture scan ning recording time in a picture reproducing machine a central picture signal obtained by scanning an original pic ture according to the scanning sequence and peripheral picture signals of the central picture signal which are appro priately weighted are added to the central signal and av eraged to obtain vignette signals, and they are appropri ately calculated for emphasizing sharpness of the picture signal.
