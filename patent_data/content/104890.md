# Separation of a crystallized component from a slurry.

## Abstract
An improved method for separating a slurry e.g a slack wax 12 into a crystallized component e.g. a wax fraction 52 and a liquid e.g. a lube oil fraction is disclosed. In a preferred embodiment, the method comprises passing the slack wax 12 into a first mixing zone 20 and subsequently into a second mixing zone 30 . Solvent selectively miscible with the lube oil fraction is added to the zones 20, 30 . The temperature of the solvent added to the second mixing zone 30 through manifold 36 is substantially higher than the temperature of the solvent added to the first mixing zone 20 through manifold 26 . This process produces a wax fraction 54 having a relatively low lube oil content.
