# Zero dead volume connector.

## Abstract
New and improved connector 10 is provided for the zero dead volume connection of separate, like diameter flexible tubing lengths 16,18 by direct tubing length end abutment and connection under controlled conditions. The connector 10 is particularly adapted for use with tubing lengths 16,18 of fluorocarbon or like materials in contemporary biomedical sample liquid analysis systems which utilize an immiscible isolation liquid or oil to minimize sample liquid carryover and maximize the accuracy of sample liquid analysis results.
