# Thermal flow meter.

## Abstract
The current flowing through a thermosensitive element 3 is amplified and output as a signal indicating its magnitude. The signal is processed by being converted into a digital signal and is used to calculate, for example, the quantity of fuel that should be supplied for the thus measured quantify of intake air in an internal combustion engine. The current is supplied to the thermosensitive element 3 from the positive electrode of a power source 40 , and returns to the negative electrode thereof via a return line 52 . The return line and a ground poten tial line 56 of the amplifier 16 are separate lines. The magni tude of the current flowing through the thermosensitive ele ment 3 is varied by varying the potential of a point on the re turn line 52 accordingly. Because the return line 52 and the ground potential line 56 are separate, the ground potential can be kept constantly stable.
