## Description
This invention relates to a liquid jet recording head, more particularly to a recording head for generation of small droplets of a liquid for recording to be used in a liquid jet recording system in which recording is performed by generating small droplets of a liquid for recording such as ink, and attaching them onto a recording medium such as paper. The liquid jet recording system which performs recording by generating small droplets of a liquid for recording such as ink, and attaching them onto a recording medium such as paper is attracting attention as the recording system which is extremely small to negligible extent in generation of noize during recording, and also capable of high speed recording and further enables recording on a plain paper without requiring any special treatment such as fixing, and various types of this system have been actively studied. The recording head portion of the recording device to be used in the liquid jet recording system generally consists of an orifice for discharging a liquid for recording liquid discharging outlet , a liquid passage connected to the orifice and having a portion at which the energy for discharging the liquid for recording acts on the liquid for recording and a liquid chamber for storing the liquid for recording to be fed into the liquid passage. The energy for discharging the liquid for recording during recording is generated in most cases by means of a discharge energy generating element of various types such as heat generating element and piezoelectric element, which is arranged at a predetermined position at the portion where the discharging energy is permitted to act on the liquid for recording which constitutes a part of the liquid passage energy acting portion . As the method for preparing the liquid jet recording head with such a constitution, there have been known, for example, the method comprising the steps of forming fine grooves on a flat plate of for example glass, metal, by cutting or etching and bonding another appropriate plate onto the flat plate having such grooves formed thereon to thereby form liquid passages or the method comprising the steps of forming groove walls of a cured photosensitive resin on a substrate having a discharging energy generating element arranged thereon according to the photolithographic step to provide grooves for the liquid passages on the substrate and bonding another flat plate covering onto the grooved plate thus formed to thereby form liquid passages for example, Japanese Laid open Patent Application No. 43876 1982 . Of these methods for preparation of the liquid jet recording heads, the latter method employing a photosensitive resin is more advantageous than the former method in that liquid jet recording heads can be provided with better quality and cheaper cost because it enables fine working with better precision and better yield and bulk production with ease. As the photosensitive resin to be used in preparation of such recording heads, there have been employed those used for pattern formation in printing plates or printed wiring or those known as the photocurable coating materials or adhesives to be used for for example glass, metal, ceramics. Also, in aspect of working efficiency, dry film type resins have been primarily utilized. In the recording head employing a cured film of a photosensitive resin, in order to obtain excellent characteristics such as high recording characteristic, durability and reliability, the photosensitive resin to be used for the recording head is required to have the following characteristics In EP A 0 208 300 a liquid jet recording head is described comprising a graft copolymerized polymer, an epoxy resin and a monomer having an ethylenically unsaturated bond. However, under the present situation, none of the photosensitive resins used for formation of the liquid jet recording head hitherto known in the art satisfy all of the above requisite characteristics. To describe in more detail, those employed for pattern formation in printing for example plates, printed wirings, as the photosensitive resin for recording head are inferior in adhesion or close contact with for example glass, ceramics, plastic film, to be used as the substrate, although they are excellent in sensitivity and resolution, and also insufficient in mechanical strength and durability when cured. For this reason, as the stage of preparation of recording heads, or in the course during usage, there is involved the drawback that deformation of the resin cured film or peel off from the substrate or damages are liable to occur, which may cause impairment markedly of reliability of the recording head such as lowering in recording characteristics by impeding the flow of the liquid for recording in the liquid passages or making the liquid droplet discharging direction unstable. On the other hand, those which are known as photocurable type coating materials or adhesives to be used for glass, metals and ceramics, although having advantages of excellent close contact or adhesiveness with the substrate formed of these materials and also satisfactory mechanical strength and durability obtained when cured, are inferior in sensitivity and resolution and therefore requires an exposure device of higher intensity or an exposure operation for longer time. Further, their inherent characteristics cannot afford providing precise and high density pattern with good resolution, whereby there is involved the problem that it is not suitable for a recording head for which minute precise working is particularly required. The present invention has been accomplished in view of the problems as described above and an object of the present invention is to provide a liquid jet recording head having a liquid passage wall comprising a resin cured film satisfying all of the requisite characteristics as mentioned above, which is inexpensive, precise, high in reliability and excellent in durability. Another object of the present invention is to provide a liquid jet recording head having a constitution of which the liquid passage is minutely worked with good precision and good yield. A further object of the present invention is to provide a liquid jet recording head which is high in reliability and excellent in durability even when formed into multi orifices. According to the present invention, there is provided a liquid jet recording head, having a liquid passage communicated to the discharging outlet of the liquid provided on a substrate surface, said passage being formed by subjecting a layer of a resin composition curable with an active energy ray to a predetermined pattern exposure with the use of said active energy ray to thereby form a cured region of said resin composition and removing the uncured region from said layer, said resin composition being an active energy ray curing resin composition comprising the component i shown below, at least one of the components ii and iii shown below and the component iv shown below Fig. 1 to Fig. 6 are schematic illustrations for explanation of the liquid jet recording head of the present invention and the methods for producing the same. Referring now to the drawings, the liquid jet recording head of the present invention is described in detail. Fig. 1 is an embodiment of the liquid recording head of the present invention, Fig. 1A showing a perspective view of the main portion thereof and Fig. 1B showing a sectional view of Fig. 1A cut along the line C C . The liquid jet recording head comprises basically a substrate 1, a resin cured film 3H provided on said substrate 1 and subjected to patterning to a desired shape and a covering 7 laminated on said resin cured film 3H, and these members form an orifice 9 for discharging a liquid for recording, liquid passages 6 2 communicated to said orifice 9 and having the portions at which the energy for discharging the liquid for recording acts on the liquid for recording and a liquid chamber 6 1 for storing the liquid for a recording to be supplied into said liquid passages 6 2. Further, at the through hole 8 provided on the covering 7, a feeding pipe 10 for feeding the liquid for recording into the liquid chamber 6 1 is bonded to the outside of the recording head. In Fig. 1A, the feeding pipe 10 is omitted. During recording, the energy for discharging the liquid for recording is generated by applying discharging signals as desired on the discharge energy generating elements 2 of various types such as heat generating elements and piezoelectric elements, arranged at predetermined positions in the portions for acting the discharging energy on the liquid for recording constituting a part of the liquid passages 6 2 through wirings not shown connected to these elements 2. The substrate 1 constituting the recording head of the present invention comprises a glass, ceramics, plastic or metal and the generating elements 2 are arranged in a desired number at predetermined positions. In the embodiment of Fig. 1, two generating elements are provided, but the number and arrangement of the heat generating elements are determined depending on the desired constitution of the recording head. On the other hand, the covering 7 comprises a flat plate of glass, ceramics, plastic or metal and is bonded onto the resin cured film 3H by fusion or adhesion with the use of an adhesive, and it is also provided with a through hole 8 for connecting a feeding pipe 10 at a predetermined position. In the recording head of the present invention, the resin cured film 3H subjected to patterning to a predetermined shape constituting the liquid passages 6 2 and the liquid chamber 6 1 has been obtained by subjecting a layer comprising a resin composition with the composition as described below on the substrate 1 or on the covering 7 to patterning according to the photolithographic step. Also, said resin cured film 3H may also be subjected to patterning as integrated with the covering comprising a resin composition having the composition as described below. The resin composition to be used for formation of a resin cured product provided on a substrate for constituting at least a portion which becomes the liquid passage is an active energy ray curing type resin composition comprising The composition of the active energy curing type resin composition to be used for formation of the recording head of the present invention is described in detail below. The graft copolymerized polymer i which is the essential component of the active energy ray curing resin composition comprises a trunk chain having relatively rigid properties suitable for a structural material having graft chains composed mainly of the above monomers A F having hydrophilic property and exhibiting excellent adhesion to the substrate added thereto. In constituting the above graft copolymerized polymer, specific examples of the monomers A F to be used for constitution of the graft chains are shown below. Examples of the acrylic monomer containing hydroxyl group s of A include 2 hydroxyethyl meth acrylate hereinafter, meth acrylate means to include both of acrylate and methacrylate , 2 hydroxypropyl meth acrylate, 3 chloro 2 hydroxypropyl meth acrylate, 4 hydroxybutyl meth acrylate, 3 hydroxybutyl meth acrylate, 5 hydroxypentyl meth acrylate, 6 hydroxyhexyl meth acrylate, or monoester of 1,4 cyclohexanedimethanol with acrylic acid or methacrylic acid, including those obtained under the trade names of Aronix M5700 produced by Toa Gosei Kagaku K.K. , TONE M100 caprolactone acrylate, produced by Union Carbide . Light Ester HO mpp produced by Kyoeisha Yushi Kagaku Kogyo K.K. , Light Ester M 600A trade name of 2 hydroxy 3 phenoxypropylacrylate, produced by Kyoeisha Yushi Kagaku Kogyo K.K. , and also monoesters of divalent alcohols such as 1,10 decanediol, neopentylglycol, bis 2 hydroxyethyl terephthalate, bisphenol A and addition products of ethylene oxide or propylene oxide with meth acrylic acid. Examples of the amino or alkylamino containing acrylic monomer of B include for example meth acrylamide, N,N dimethylaminoethyl meth acrylamide, N,N dimethyl meth acrylamide, N,N dimethylaminopropyl meth acrylamide and N,N di t butylaminoethyl meth acrylamide. Examples of the carboxyl containing acrylic or vinyl monomer of C include for example meth acrylic acid, fumaric acid, itaconic acid or those known under the trade names of Aronix M 5400, Aronix M 5500. Examples of vinylpyridine or its derivatives of E include for example 2 vinylpyridine, 4 vinylpyridine, 2 vinyl 6 methylpyridine, 4 vinyl 1 methylpyridine, 2 vinyl 5 ethylpyridine, 4 4 pipenilinoethyl pyridine. The above monomers A E all have hydrophilic properties and impart firm adhesion when the resin composition used in the present invention is adhered to a substrate such as glass, ceramics and plastic. Examples of the acrylamide derivative represented by the formula I of F include for example monomers having hydrophilic property and also heat cross linkability such as N methylol meth acrylamide, N propoxymethyl meth acrylamide, N n butoxymethyl meth acrylamide, β hydroxyethoxymethyl meth acrylamide, N ethoxymethyl meth acrylamide, N methoxymethyl meth acrylamide, α hydroxymethyl N methylolacrylamide, α hydroxyethyl N butoxymethylacrylamide, α hydroxypropyl N propoxymethylacrylamide, α ethyl N methylolacrylamide and α propyl N methylolacrylamide. These monomers F have hydrophilic property as a matter of course, and also condensing cross linkability by heating, and will generally form crosslinked bonds by elimination of water molecules or alcohol at a temperature of 100 C or higher, thereby to form a network structure also in the graft copolymerized polymer itself after curing, whereby the pattern obtained by curing can be further improved in for example chemical resistance and mechanical strength, to make the present invention more effective. Also, to the above monomers A F , monomer which can be crosslinked by ring opening by heat such as glycidyl meth acrylate may be partially added to constitute the graft chains, whereby the same effect as in the above F can be obtained. In addition to the above thermal crosslinking, for the same purpose, it is also effective to crosslink the graft copolymerized polymer with an active energy ray by introducing a photopolymerizable monomer into a part of the graft chains of the graft copolymer. As the method for imparting photopolymerizability to the graft chain, there may be employed for example, When the graft chain of the graft copolymerized polymer is heat crosslinkable, it is preferably to perform heating after formation of a pattern by irradiation of an active energy ray. On the other hand, also when the above graft chain is photopolymerizable, there is no problem in performing heating within the range permissible in aspect of heat resistance of the substrate, and rather preferable results can be given by heating. The graft chains are not limited to those derived only from the hydrophilic monomers as exemplified by the above A F , but the graft chains may also contain various hydrophobic monomers which can exhibit various other functions as the copolymer component within the range of 0 to about 25 weight . The monomer constituting the trunk chain of the graft copolymerized polymer is an alkyl methacrylate having 1 to 4 carbon atoms in the alkyl group such as methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, isobutyl methacrylate and t butyl methacrylate, acrylonitrile and styrene. The trunk chain is not limited to those derived from only the above monomers, but it may be also a trunk chain using other monomers such as methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, n butyl acrylate, lauryl acrylate, n butyl methacrylate, 2 ethylhexyl methacrylate, glycidyl methacrylate and vinyl acetate, as the copolymer component within the range of 0 to about 50 weight . In the resin composition for formation of the recording head in the present invention, the above trunk chain gives high cohesive strength to the composition. The composition can be provided in various shapes such as solutions or solid films. However, when it is practically used as the dry film, it is preferable to use a relatively rigid trunk chain having a glass transition temperature of about 50 C or higher in order to maintain the composition in shape of a film. In this case, the trunk chain to be used may be constituted of two or more kinds having different glass transition temperatures. On the other hand, when the composition is to be used as a solution, it is possible to use a trunk chain having a low glass transition temperature so as to give the composition flexibility. However, also in this case, in order to obtain a pattern having excellent resistance to the liquid for recording and high mechanical strength, it is preferable to use a trunk chain having a high glass transition temperature. The graft copolymerized polymers to be used for the resin composition for formation of a resin cured film in the present invention may be classified broadly into those having no curability, those having photocrosslinkability and those having heat crosslinkability. In either case, the graft copolymerized polymer enables precise patterning by imparting form maintaining property to the composition in the curing steps namely active energy ray irradiation and optional heat curing of the said composition, and also gives excellent adhesiveness, chemical resistance as well as high mechanical strength to the pattern obtained by curing. The above graft copolymerized polymer to be used in the composition of the present invention can be prepared according to the known methods, specifically by various methods as disclosed in Base and Application of Polymer Alloy p. 10 35 edited by Polymer Society of Japan, published by Tokyo Kagaku Dojin K.K., 1981 . Examples of those methods include 1 the chain transfer method, 2 the method by use of radiation, 3 the oxidation polymerization method, 4 the ion graft polymerization method and 5 macromonomer method. For the graft copolymer to be used in the present invention, since the surface active effect is marked when the length of the graft chains are uniform, it is preferable to use the method of 4 and 5 , particularly preferably the macromonomer method of 5 which is advantageous in design of materials. The graft copolymer should preferably have a weight average molecular weight of about 5000 to 300000 and, when used as a dry film, preferably about 30000 to 300000. The monomer ii having an ethylenically unsaturated bond to be used in the resin composition for formation of a resin cured film in the present invention is a component for permitting the said composition to exhibit curability with an active energy ray, particularly imparting excellent sensitivity to an active energy ray to the said composition, similarly as the epoxy resin iii as hereinafter described. The said nonomer ii should preferably have a boiling point of 100 C or higher under atmospheric pressure, having preferably two or more ethylenically unsaturated bonds, and various known monomers curable by irradiation of an active energy ray can be used. Specific examples of such monomers having two or more ethylenically unsaturated bonds include a acrylic acid esters of methacrylic acid esters of polyfunctional epoxy resins having two or more epoxy groups in one molecule, b acrylic acid esters or methacrylic acid esters of alkyleneoxide addition products of polyhydric alcohols, c polyester acrylates having acrylic acid ester group at the terminal ends of the molecular chains of polyesters having molecular weights of 500 to 3000 comprising dibasic acid and dihydric alcohol, d the reaction products between polyisocyanates and acrylic acid monomers having hydroxyl groups.

The hydroxyl containing acrylic monomer as herein mentioned may include typically meth acrylic acid esters, preferably hydroxyethyl meth acrylate, hydroxypropyl meth acrylate. It is also possible to use other acrylic monomers containing hydroxyl group s mentioned in the present specification as useful for the graft chains in the graft copolymerized polymer. In addition to the monomers having two or more ethylenically unsaturated bonds as mentioned above, it is also possible to use monomers having only one ethylenically unsaturated bond as mentioned below together with these monomers. To exemplify such monomers having one ethylenically unsaturated bond, there may be included, for example, carboxyl containing unsaturated monomers such as acrylic acid and methacrylic acid glycidyl containing unsaturated monomers such as glycidyl acrylate and glycidyl methacrylate C₂ C₈ hydroxyalkyl esters of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid such as hydroxyethyl acrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, hydroxypropyl acrylate and hydroxypropyl methacrylate monoesters of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid with polyethyleneglycol or polypropyleneglycol such as polyethyleneglycol monoacrylate, polyethyleneglycol monomethacrylate, polypropyleneglycol monoacrylate and polypropyleneglycol monomethacrylate C₁ C₁₂ alkyl or cycloalkyl esters of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid such as methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, propyl acrylate, isopropyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, hexyl acrylate, octyl acrylate, lauryl acrylate, cyclohexyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, propyl methacrylate, isopropyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate, isopropyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate, hexyl methacrylate, octyl methacrylate, lauryl methacrylate and cyclohexyl methacrylate other monomers such as styrene, vinyltoluene, methylstyrene, vinyl acetate, vinyl chloride, vinyl isobutyl ether, acrylonitrile, acrylamide, methacrylamide, acrylic acid or methacrylic acid adduct of alkylglycidyl ether, vinylpyrrolidone, dicyclopentenyloxyethyl meth acrylate, ε caploractone modified hydroxyalkyl meth acrylate, tetrahydrofurfulyl acrylate, phenoxyethyl acrylate and others. By use of the above monomer ii having ethylenically unsaturated bonds, high sensitivity and satisfactory curability to an active energy ray can be imparted to the resin composition for formation of a resin cured film in the present invention. The epoxy resin iii comprising one or more compounds having one or more epoxy groups in one molecule to be used in the resin composition for formation of a resin cured film in the present invention is a component which permits the said composition to exhibit high sensitivity and satisfactory curability together with the monomer ii having ethylenically unsaturated bonds as described above by the action of the polymerization initiator iv as described hereinafter and, in addition thereto, imparts for example better adhesiveness with a substrate, water resistance, chemical resistance and dimensional stability, to the cured film constituting the said resin composition, when it is formed by coating the said resin composition in liquid state on substrates comprising for example glass, plastics, ceramics, followed by curing, or when it is used in the form of a dry film adhered on substrates. In the resin composition for formation of a resin cured film in the present invention, any epoxy resin comprising at least one compound containing one or more epoxy groups in one molecule can be used without particular limitation. However, in view of, for example, chemical resistance or mechanical strength of the cured film obtained by curing of the said resin composition or high durability as a construction material, or in view of workability during formation of patterns comprising the cured film of the said composition on a substrate or resolution of the patterns formed, it is preferable to use an epoxy resin comprising at least one kind of compound containing two or more epoxy groups in one molecule. Examples of the above epoxy resin containing 2 or more epoxy groups in one molecule include epoxy resins as represented by the bisphenol A type, novolac type, alicyclic type, or polyfunctional epoxy resins such as bisphenol S, bisphenol F, tetrahydroxyphenylmethane tetraglycidyl ether, resorcinol diglycidyl ether, glycerine triglycidyl ether, pentaerythritol triglycidyl ether, isocyanuric acid triglycidyl ether and epoxy urethane resins represented by the following formula II wherein R represents an alkylene group or an oxyalkylene group, R₀ represents or an alkylene group , and mixtures of at least one of them. Specific examples of these polyfunctional epoxy resins include those as mentioned below. That is, the bisphenol A type epoxy resin may be, for example, Epicoat 828, 834, 871, 1001, 1004 trade names, produced by Shell Chemical Co. , DER 331 J, 337 J, 661 J, 664 J, 667 J produced by Dow Chemical Co. , and Epicrone 800 trade name, produced by Dainippon Ink Kagaku K.K. . The novolac type epoxy resin may be, for example, Epicoat 152, 154, 172 trade names, produced by Shell Chemical Co. , Allaldite EPN 1138 trade name, produced by Ciba Geigy Co. , DER 431, 438 and 439 trade names, produced by Dow Chemical Co. .

These monofunctional epoxy resins can be used together with the polyfunctional epoxy resin as mentioned above or also individually alone. In the resin composition for formation of a resin cured film in the present invention, the above epoxy resin iii has high sensitivity and satisfactory curability to an active energy ray generated by the action of the Lewis acid, which is generated by irradiating the polymerization initiator iv as described below with the active energy ray, on the epoxy groups of the resin, thereby enabling precise and high resolution pattern formation with the said resin composition through its curability together with the monomer ii having ethylenically unsaturated bonds as described above, but also in addition thereto imparting for example good adhesion to a substrate, chemical resistance, dimensional stability, through heat curability possessed inherently by the epoxy resin. The polymerization initiator iv capable of generating a Lewis acid by irradiation of an active energy ray to be used in the resin composition for formation of a resin cured film in the present invention is a component for curing the epoxy resin iii as mentioned above with the action of the Lewis acid, which permits the said resin composition to exhibit high sensitivity and satisfactory curability to an active energy ray together with the monomer ii having ethylenically unsaturated bond s as described above. As such a polymerization initiator iv , there may be preferably used, for example, aromatic onium salt compounds having photosensitivity containing an element belonging to the groups VIa as disclosed in Japanese Patent publication No. 14278 1977 or aromatic onium salt compounds having photosensitivity containing an element belonging to the group Va as shown in Japanese Patent publication No. 14279 1977 or aromatic halonium salts having photosensitivity as shown in Japanese Patent publication No. 147277 1977. These aromatic onium salt compounds or aromatic halonium salts all have the characteristic of curing the epoxy resin iii by releasing a Lewis acid by irradiation with an active energy ray. The aromatic onium salt compounds having photosensitivity of the element belonging to the group VIa or the group Va may include typically the compounds of the following formula III On the other hand, the photosensitive aromatic halonium salt may be exemplified by the following formula IV wherein R⁶ is a monovalent aromatic organic group, R⁷ is a divalent aromatic organic group, X is halogen, M is a metal or metalloid and Q is halogen, respectively, Specific examples of the photosensitive aromatic onium salt compounds containing an element belonging to the group VIa or the group Va which can be formulated in the resin composition for formation of a resin cured film in the present invention may include the photosensitive aromatic onium salts of the elements belonging to the group VIa as shown below. and photosensitive aromatic onium salts of the elements belonging to the group Va as shown below Specific example of the photosensitive aromatic halonium salts include, for example, In addition to the polymerization initiator iv releasing a Lewis acid as described above, it is also possible to employ, if desired, curing agents generally employed widely as the curing agent for epoxy resins, such as polyamine, polyamide, acid anhydride, boron trifluoride amine complex, dicyandiamide, imidazoles and complexes of imidazole with metal. In the active energy ray curing resin composition for formation of a resin cured film in the present invention, a radical polymerization initiator capable of forming organic free radicals which can be activated by the action of an active energy ray may be added, in addition to the polymerization initiator iv as herein mentioned, for the purpose of imparting further excellent curability to an active energy ray to the monomer ii having ethylenically unsaturated bonds as described above, or when employing a graft copolymerized polymer i having photopolymerizability. Particularly, in the case when employing a graft copolymerized polymer i having photopolymerizability and an active energy ray with a wavelength of 250 nm to 450 nm, it is preferable to use the radical polymerization initiator as mentioned above together with the above polymerization initiator iv . As the radical polymerization initiator, known substances having the property of being activated with an active energy ray, forming organic free radicals and initiating radical polymerization can be used without any particular limitation. Specific examples of such radical polymerization initiators include benzyl, benzoin alkyl ethers such as benzoin isobutyl ether, benzoin isopropyl ether, benzoin n butyl ether, benzoin ethyl ether, benzoin methyl ether benzophenones such as benzophenone and 4,4 bis N,N diethylamino benzophenone, benzophenone methyl ether anthraquinones such as 2 ethylanthraquinone and 2 t butylanthraquinone xanthones such as 2,4 dimethylthioxanthone and 2,4 diisopropylthioxanthone acetophenones such as 2,2 dimethoxy 2 phenylacetophenone, α, α dichloro 4 phenoxyacetophenone, p tert butyltrichloroacetophenone, p tert butyldichloroacetophenone, 2,2 diethoxyacetophenone and p dimethylaminoacetophenone or hydroxycyclohexylphenyl ketone e.g., Irugacure 184, produced by Ciba Geigy Co. , 1 4 isopropylphenyl 2 hydroxy 2 methylpropane 1 one e.g. propane 1 one Darocure 1173, produced by MERCK Co. as preferable ones. In addition to these radical polymerization initiators, amino compounds may be added as the photopolymerization accelerator. The amino compounds to be used as the photopolymerication accelerator may include for example ethanolamine, ethyl 4 dimethylaminobenzoate, 2 dimethylamino ethylbenzoate, p dimethylaminobenzoic acid n amylester, p dimethylaminobenzoic acid isoamyl ester. The constitutional ratio of the above materials constituting the active energy ray curing resin composition for formation of a resin cured film in the present invention may be preferably such that G G M E is within the range from 0.2 to 0.8 and E E M within the range from 0.3 to 0.7, wherein G is the content in parts by weight, for the graft copolymerized polymer i , M for the monomer having ethylenically unsaturated bonds ii and E for the epoxy resin iii , and the polymerization initiator iv preferably 0.2 to 15 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of G M E in the above formula, either one of M and E may be zero . If G G M E is smaller than 0.2, the content of the graft copolymerized polymer in the said resin composition becomes so small that satisfactory adhesiveness with a substrate based on the graft copolymerized polymer can not be exhibited, or the drying property of the solvent when employing a solvent may be worsened to make the surface of the pattern obtained by curing sticky. On the other hand, if G G M E is in excess of 0.8, the content of the monomer having ethylenically unsaturated bond s and the epoxy resin in the said resin composition is reduced, whereby sensitivity to the active energy ray may be lowered to retard curing speed during pattern formation, or lower resolution of the pattern formed, and the pattern obtained by curing may be lowered in mechanical strength and chemical resistance. When a radical polymerization initiator activated by the action of an activation energy ray is used in the resin composition for formation of a resin cured film in the present invention, the polymerization initiator may be added in an amount within the range from 0.1 to 20 parts by weight, preferably from 1 to 10 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the resin components comprising the graft copolymerized polymer i , the monomer having ethylenically unsaturated bonds ii and the epoxy resin iii i ii iii . In the above formula, the case when either one of ii and iii is zero is also included. As the solvent to be used when employing the active energy ray curing resin composition for formation of a resin cured film in the present invention in the form of a solution or when coating the composition on a plastic film which is a film substrate in formation of a dry film, hydrophilic solvents such as alcohols, glycol ethers and glycol esters, may be employed. Of course, it is also possible to use mixtures comprising these hydrophilic solvents as the main component, mixed optionally at appropriate proportions with ketones such as methyl ethyl ketone and methyl isobutyl ketone esters such as ethyl acetate and isobutyl acetate aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene and xylene, and their halogen derivatives, aliphatic solvents containing chlorine such as methylene chloride and 1,1,1 trichloroethane. These solvents can be also used as the developer for the resin composition after patterning. The active energy ray curing resin composition for formation of a resin cured film in the present invention may further contain in addition to the above radical polymerization initiator or the solvent as described above, additives such as catalysts for condensation crosslinking, heat polymerization inhibitors, colorants dyes and pigments , fine particulate fillers, adhesion promotors and plasticizers, if desired. The condensation crosslinking catalyst may include sulfonic acids, typically p toluenesulfonic acid, carboxylic acids such as formic acid. The heat polymerization inhibitor may include for example hydroquinone and derivatives thereof, p methoxyphenol and phenothiazine. As the colorant there can be added oil soluble dyes and pigments within the range which do not substantially prevent transmission of the active energy ray. As the filler, for enhancement of hardness of coating, as well as for enhancement of coloration, adhesion, mechanical strength, there may be employed for example extender pigments and plastic fine particles, which are used in coating materials in general. As the adhesion promotor, silane coupling agents, low molecular surfactants as inorganic surface modifiers may be effectively used in the composition of the present invention. The resin composition comprising the composition as described above is cured with an active energy ray to form the resin cured film 3H possessed by the recording head of the present invention. Next, as an embodiment of the case when employing a dry film type as the resin composition for formation of the resin cured film 3H, the method for preparing the liquid jet recording head of the present invention is described in detail by referring to the drawings. Figs. 2 to 6 are schematic illustrationS for description of the preparation procedure of the liquid jet recording head of the present invention. For formation of the liquid jet recording head of the present invention, first, as shown in Fig. 2, a discharge energy generating element 2 such as heat generating element or piezoelectric element is arranged in a desired number on a substrate 1 such as glass, ceramic, plastic or a metal. If desired, for the purpose of imparting resistance to the liquid for recording or electrical insulating property, to the surface of the substrate 1, the surface may be coated with a protective layer of for example SiO₂, Ta₂O₅ and glass. Also, to the discharge energy generating element 2 is connected electrodes for inputting recording signals, although not shown in the drawing. Next, the surface of the substrate 1 obtained after the step shown in Fig. 2 is cleaned and at the same time dried at, for example, 80 to 150 C, and then the active energy ray curing resin composition 3 as described above of the dry film type film thickness, about 25 µm to 200 µm , as shown in Fig. 3A and Fig. 3B is heated to about 40 to 150 C and laminated on the substrate surface 1A at a speed of, for example, 0.5 to 0.4 f min. under the pressurizing condition of 9.81 10⁴ to 29.4 10⁴ N m² 1 to 3 Kg cm² . Subsequently, as shown in Fig. 4, on the dry film layer 3 provided on the substrate surface 1A, a photomask 4 having a pattern 4P with a desired shape which does not transmit the active energy ray is superposed, and then exposure is effected from above the photomask 4. Registration between the photomask 4 and the substrate 1 is effected so that the above element 2 may be positioned in the liquid passage region finally formed after the steps of exposure and developing processing, for example, according to the method in which registration marks are previously drawn respectively on the substrate 1 and the mask 4 and registration is effected following the marks. By carrying out such an exposure, the portion other than that covered with the pattern, namely the portion exposed of the dry film layer 3 is cured by polymerization, to become insoluble in a solvent, while the unexposed portion remains soluble in a solvent. The active energy ray to be used for such a pattern exposure may include ultraviolet rays UV rays or electron beams which have widely been practically applied. As the UV ray light source, there may be employed high pressure such as mercury lamps, ultra high pressure mercury lamps and metal halide lamps, enriched in light with wavelength of 250 nm to 450 nm, preferably those which can give a light intensity of about 1 mW cm² to 100 mW cm² at the wavelength in the vicinity of 365 nm at a distance between the lamp and the material to be irradiated which is practically permissible. The electron beam irradiation device is not particularly limited, but a device having a dose within the range of 0.5 to 20 M Rad is practically suitable. After completion of the pattern exposure of the dry film layer 3, the dry film 3 subjected to exposure is developed by, for example, dipping in a volatile organic solvent such as 1,1,1 trichloroethane, to remove by dissolution the unpolymerized uncured portion of the dry film layer 3 which is solvent soluble, thereby forming the grooves which will finally become the liquid passages 6 2 and liquid chamber 6 1 with the resin cured film 3H remaining on the substrate 1 as shown in Fig. 5A and Fig. 5B. As the next step, in such a case where a heat curable linear polymer is used in the active energy ray curing resin composition the cured resin film 3H on the substrate is subjected to heat polymerization by heating, for example, at a temperature of 100 C for about 10 minutes. In the recording head of this embodiment, the grooves for liquid passages 6 2 and liquid chamber 6 1 are formed by referring to an example using a resin composition of the dry film type, namely a solid composition. However, the active energy ray curing resin composition which can be used in formation of the recording head of the present invention is not limited to only solid compositions, but also a liquid composition may be available. As the method for forming a layer comprising the composition by use of a liquid resin composition on the substrate, there may be employed, for example, the method according to squeezee as used in preparation of a relief image, namely the method in which a wall with a height corresponding to the desired thickness of the resin composition layer to be formed is provided around the substrate and superfluous resin composition is removed by means of a squeezee. In this case, the resin composition may appropriately have a viscosity of 0.1 Pa s 100 cp to 0.3 Pa s 3000 cp . The height of the wall placed around the substrate is also required to be determined in view of the amount reduced by evaporation of the solvent contained in the light sensitive resin composition. When a solid resin composition is employed, it is suitable to use the method in which a dry film is plastered on the substrate by pressure contact under heating. However, in forming the recording head of the present invention, a solid film type is convenient in handling and also with respect to easy and correct control of the thickness. After having thus formed the grooves for constituting finally the liquid passages 6 2 and the liquid chamber 6 1 with the resin cured film 3H, a flat plate 7 which is a covering over the grooves is bonded with an adhesive on the resin cured film 3H to form a bonded body, as shown in Fig. 6A and Fig. 6B. In the steps shown in Fig. 6A and Fig. 6B, as the specific method for providing the covering 7, for example, after the flat plate 7 of for example glass, ceramic, metal and plastic, is applied with an epoxy resin type adhesive by spin coating to a thickness of 3 to 4 µm, the adhesive layer is previously heated to effect the so called B staging and then palstered on the cured dry film 3H, followed by main curing of the above adhesive layer. However, it is also possible to use no adhesive such as by having a flat plate 7 of a thermoplastic resin such as acrylic resin, ABS resin and polyethylene, thermally fused directly onto the resin cured film 3H. It is also preferable to use the method in which a resin layer comprising the resin composition for formation of the resin cured film in the present invention is provided on the covering 7 on the side to be bonded to the liquid passages, the resin layer is thermally fused to the resin cured film 3H having formed liquid passages thereon and thereafter heated with irradiation of an active energy ray, namely the method of using the resin composition for formation of the resin cured film in the present invention as the adhesive. In Fig. 6, 6 1 shows a liquid chamber, 6 2 liquid passages and 8 the through holes for connecting feeding pipes not shown for feeding the liquid for recording to the liquid chamber 6 1 from outside of the recording head not shown. After having completed thus the bonding between the resin cured film 3H provided on the substrate 1 and the flat plate 7, the bonded body is cut along C C positioned on the downstream side of the liquid passage 6 2 shown in Fig. 6A and Fig. 6B, thereby forming an orifice for discharging the liquid for recording which is the opening portion of the liquid passage at the cut surface. This step is conducted for making the interval between the discharge energy generating element 2 and the orifice 9 adequate, and the region to be cut may be selected suitably. For this cutting, there may be employed for example the dicing method, which is conventionally employed in semiconductor industries. The downstream portion of the liquid passage as mentioned in the present invention refers to the region on the downstream side in the flow direction of the liquid for recording when recording is performed by use of a recording head, more specifically the portion of the liquid passage downstream of the position where the discharge energy generating element 2 is located. After completion of cutting, the cut surface is smoothened by polishing and a feeding pipe 10 is mounted on the through hole 8 to complete a liquid jet recording head as shown in Fig. 1. In the recording head as described above, the liquid passages 6 2 and the liquid chamber 6 1 are formed integrally with a resin cured film 3H, but the recording head of the present invention is not limited to such a structure, and it is also possible to use a structure in which liquid passages are formed separately from the liquid chamber. However, even if any structure may be taken, the recording head of the present invention is such that at least a part of the resin for forming the liquid passage is formed by use of the active energy ray curing resin composition as described above. The liquid jet recording head of the present invention uses as the active energy ray curing type resin composition which is the constitutional member of said head a composition having very excellent sensitivity to the active energy ray and resolution as the pattern forming material which are imparted primarily by the monomer ii having ethylenically unsaturated bonds, the epoxy resin iii and the polymerization initiator iv generating Lewis acid contained as the essential components in said composition, and it has been rendered possible to obtain a liquid jet recording head excellent in dimensional precision with good yield by use of said active energy ray curing type resin composition. Also, the active energy ray curing type resin composition for formation of the resin cured film to be used in the present invention utilizes effectively the characteristics of the graft copolymerized polymer i and the epoxy resin iii as the essential components, namely having, in addition to excellent adhesion to a substrate and mechanical strength imparted primarily by the graft copolymerized polymer i , excellent chemical resistance and dimensional stability imparted primarily by the epoxy resin iii , whereby it has been also rendered possible to obtain a recording head having durability for a long term by use of said composition. Further, when the active energy ray curing type resin composition using the graft copolymerized polymer having curability is used, it is possible to obtain a liquid jet recording head which is particularly excellent in the above adhesiveness, mechanical strength or chemical resistance. The present invention is described in more detail by referring to the following Synthetic examples and Examples. A living polymer 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate butyl acrylate 80 20 weight ratio obtained by anion polymerization was allowed by react with p vinylbenzylchloride to obtain a macromonomer p vinylbenzylpoly 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate butyl acrylate with a weight average molecular weight of about 1800 having a vinyl group at one terminal end of the molecular chain. Solution polymerization of 30 parts by weight of the macromonomer and 70 parts by weight of methyl methacrylate in methyl cellosolve gave a thermoplastic graft copolymerized polymer having a weight average molecular Weight of 7.0 x 10⁴ this is called GP 1 . The polymethyl methacrylate chain constituting the main chain of the GP 1 has a glass transition point of 100 C. By use of the GP 1, an active energy ray curing type resin composition was prepared as follows. The composition was applied by a bar coater on a 16 µm polyethylene terephthalate film Lumilar T type to a thickness after drying of 75 µm. The coated film was protected by pressure lamination of a 25 µm polyethylene film thereon, and this was used in the subsequent formation of the recording head of the present invention. A living polymer N methylolmethacrylamide 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate 30 70 weight ratio obtained by anion polymerization was allowed to react with p vinylbenzylchloride to obtain a macromonomer p vinylbenzyl poly N methylol methacrylamide 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate with a weight average molecular weight of about 1500 having a vinyl group at one terminal end of the molecular chain. Solution polymerization of 30 parts by weight of the macromonomer and 70 parts by weight of methyl methacrylate in methyl cellosolve gave a heat crosslinkable graft copolymerized polymer having a weight average molecular weight of 7.7 x 10⁴ this is called GP 2 . The polymethyl methacrylate chain constituting the main chain of the GP 2 has a glass transition point of 100 C. By use of the GP 2, an active energy ray curing type resin composition having the following composition was prepared. The composition was applied by a bar coater on a 16 µm polyethylene terephthalate film Lumilar T type to a thickness after drying of 75 µm. The coated film was protected by pressure lamination of a 25 µm polyethylene film thereon, and this was used for the subsequent formation of the recording head of the present invention. A living polymer N butoxymethylacrylamide 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate 70 30 weight ratio obtained by anion polymerization was allowed to react with acrylic acid chloride to obtain a macromonomer acrylic acid poly butoxymethylacrylamide 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate with a weight average molecular weight of about 3000 having a vinyl group at one terminal end of the molecular chain. Copolymerization of 25 parts by weight of the macromonomer, 70 parts by weight of methyl methacrylate and 5 parts by weight of acrylonitrile was carried out in methyl cellosolve to obtain a graft copolymerized polymer having heat crosslinkability with a weight average molecular weight of 6.8 x 10⁴ this is called GP 4 . The copolymerized polymer chain of methyl methacrylate and acrylonitrile constituting the main chain of the GP 4 has a glass transition point of 105 C. By use of the GP 4, an active energy ray curing type resin composition was prepared as follows The composition was applied by a bar coater to a thickness of 75 µm after drying on a 16 µm polyethylene terephthalate film Lumilar T type , followed by drying at 100 C for 10 minutes to form a dry film having an active energy ray curing type resin composition layer with a film thickness of 75 µm, which was used in the subsequent formation of the recording head of the present invention. According to the same procedure as Synthetic example 1 except for controlling the composition of the active energy ray curing type resin composition as shown below by use of the thermoplastic graft copolymerized polymer GP 1 obtained in Synthetic example 1, a dry film having the active energy ray curing type resin composition layer was formed and used in the subsequent formation of the recording head of the present invention. According to the same procedure as Synthetic example 2 except for controlling the composition of the active energy ray curing type resin composition as shown below by use of the heat crosslinkable graft copolymerized polymer GP 2 obtained in Synthetic example 2, a dry film having the active energy ray curing type resin composition layer was formed and used in the subsequent formation of the recording head of the present invention. By use of the dry film prepared in Synthetic example 1, following the steps of Fig. 1 to Fig. 6 as described previously in the specification, an on demand type liquid jet recording head having 10 orifices orifice dimension 75 µm x 50 µm, pitch 0.125 mm with heat generating elements hafnium boride HfB₂ as the discharge energy generating element was prepared as follows. The recording head was prepared in number of 30 respectively of the same shape. First, a plurality of heat generating elements were arranged at the predetermined positions on the substrate comprising silicon and electrodes for applying recording signals were connected to these. Next, an SiO₂ layer thickness 1.0 µm as the protective film was provided on the substrate surface having the heat generating elements arranged thereon, and the surface of the protective layer was cleaned and dried. Then, the dry film obtained in the above Synthetic example 1, heated to 80 C was laminated by a hot roll type laminator trade name HRL 24, produced by Du Pont Co. on the protective layer at a roll temperature of 80 C at a speed of 0.4 f min. under the pressurizing condition of 9.81 10⁴ N m² 1 kg cm² . In this state, the layer constituted of the active energy ray curing resin composition has the polyethyleneterephthalate film as laminated on its surface. Subsequently, on the dry film provided on the substrate surface, a photomask having a pattern corresponding to the shapes of liquid passages and liquid chamber was superposed and, after performing registration so that the above element may be provided in the liquid passages to be finally formed, the dry film was exposed to UV ray using an exposure light source with deep UV lamp trade name PLA 501, produced by Canon K.K. with a luminance of 8 mW cm² on the irradiated surface from above the photomask for 150 seconds. After exposure, the polyethyleneterephthalate film was peeled off from the layer comprising the active energy ray curing type resin composition subjected to pattern exposure, the dry film exposed was developed in a sonication washing machine using a mixture of 1,1,1 trichloroethane ethanol 70 30 weight ratio at 35 C for 60 seconds to remove by dissolution the unpolymerized uncured portion of the dry film from the substrate, thereby forming grooves which will become finally the liquid passages and liquid chamber with the cured dry film remaining on the substrate. After completion of development, the cured dry film on the substrate was heated at 80 C for one hour, subjected to post exposure of 10 J cm², further followed by heating at 160 C for 60 minutes to further cure the film. After having formed thus the grooves for the liquid passages and liquid chamber with the cured dry film, a flat plate comprising soda glass provided with a through hole which becomes the covering over the groove formed was applied with an epoxy type resin adhesive to a thickness of 3 µm by spin coating, then preheated to effect B staging and plastered on the cured dry film, followed further by main curing of the adhesive to effect adhesion fixing, thus forming a bonded body. Subsequently, on the downstream side of the liquid passage of the bonded body, namely at the position of 0.150 mm toward the downstream side from the position where the discharge energy generating element is located, the bonded body was cut vertically relative to the liquid passage by means of a commercially available dicing saw trade name DAD 2H 6 model, produced by DISCO Co. to form orifices for discharging the liquid for recording. Finally, the cut surfaces were washed and dried, further smoothened by polishing, and feeding pipes for feeding the liquid for recording were mounted at the through holes to complete the liquid jet recording head. Everyone of the recording heads obtained was found to have liquid passages and liquid chamber which have faithfully reproduced the mask pattern and to be excellent in dimensional precision. The orifice dimension was within 50 5 µm and an orifice pitch within 125 5 µm. The recording heads thus prepared were tested for quality and durability during prolonged use as follows. First, for the recording heads obtained, durability test was conducted by dipping in the liquids for recording having the respective compositions shown below at 60 C for 1000 hours the environmental conditions comparable to prolonged use of recording head . After the durability test, each head subjected to said test was observed about the bonded state between substrate and the covering and the dry film. As the result, no peel off or damage could be recognized in all of the recording heads, but good adhesiveness was exhibited. Next, separately for the other 10 recording heads obtained, each head was mounted on a recording device, and the printing test was practiced by use of the above liquid for recording by applying recording signals of 10⁸ pulse continuously on the recording head for 14 hours. For each recording head, immediately after initiation of printing and after elapse of 14 hours, substantially no lowering in both of the discharging performance and printed state can be recognized. Thus, the recording heads were found to be excellent in durability. A liquid jet recording head was prepared in the same manner as Example 1, except for using the dry film prepared in Synthetic example 2. Further, for each of the recording heads prepared, the same durability test and printing test were conducted in the same manner as Example 1. After the durability test, each head subjected to said test was observed about the bonded state between substrate and the covering and the dry film. As the result, no peel off or damage could be recognized in all of the recording heads, but good adhesiveness was exhibited. Also, in the printing test, for each recording head, immediately after initiation of printing and after elapse of 14 hours, substantially no lowering in both of the discharging performance of the liquid for recording and the printed state can be recognized. Thus, the recording heads were found to be excellent in durability. By use of the dry film prepared in Synthetic example 3, this was laminated on a substrate by means of a hot roll type laminator trade name, HRL 24, produced by Du Pont Co. at a roll temperature of 80 C, a roll pressure of 9.81 10⁴ N m² 1 Kg cm² , and a laminating speed of 1 m min., and then subjected to a pattern exposure by means of a high pressure mercury lamp as the exposure light source at a luminance of 34 mW cm² in the vicinity of 254 nm on the irradiated surface. Further, after the polyethyleneterephthalate film was peeled off from the active energy ray curing type resin composition layer dry film subjected to pattern exposure, the layer was developed by spraying a mixture of 1,1,1 trichloroethane butyl cellosolve 70 30 weight ratio , at 35 C for 60 seconds. Then, the cured dry film on the substrate was heated at 80 C for 10 minutes, subsequently subjected to post exposure of 10 J cm², followed by heating at 50 C for 60 minutes to cure further the film. Except for using the cured resin obtained above, following the same procedure as Example 1, a liquid jet recording head was prepared. Further, for each of the recording heads prepared, the same durability test and printing test were conducted in the same manner as Example 1. After the durability test, each head subjected to said test was observed about the bonded state between substrate and the covering and the dry film. As the result, no peel off or damage could be recognized in all of the recording heads, but good adhesiveness was exhibited. Also, in the printing test, for each recording head, immediately after initiation of printing and after elapse of 14 hours, substantially no lowering in both of the discharging performance of the liquid for recording and printed state can be recognized. A liquid jet recording head was prepared in the same manner as Example 1, except for using the dry films obtained in Synthetic examples 4 and 5, respectively. Further, for each of the recording heads prepared, the same durability test and printing test were conducted in the same manner as Example 1. After the durability test, each head subjected to said test was observed about the bonded state between substrate and the covering and the dry film. As the result, no peel off or damage could be recognized in all of the recording heads, but good adhesiveness was exhibited. Also, in the printing test, for each recording head, immediately after initiation of printing and after elapse of 14 hours, substantially no lowering in performance in both of the discharging performance of the liquid for recording and printed state can be recognized. Thus, the recording head was found to be excellent in durability. A living polymer 3 chloro 2 hydroxypropyl methacrylate N vinylpyrrolidone 90 10 weight ratio obtained by anion polymerization was allowed to react with acrylic acid chloride to obtain a macromonomer acrylic acid poly 3 chloro 2 hydroxypropyl methacrylate N vinylpyrrolidone with a weight average molecular weight of about 2500 having a vinyl group at one terminal end of the molecular chain. Copolymerization of 25 parts by weight of the macromonomer, 65 parts by weight of methyl methacrylate and 10 parts by weight of dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate was carried out in methyl isobutyl ketone weight average molecular weight 6.5 x 10⁴ . Subsequently, to the polymer solution containing 100 parts by weight of the copolymer dissolved therein, 11 parts by weight of a partial urethane compound obtained by reacting hexamethylene diisocyanate with 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate to a ratio of NCO group equivalent OH group equivalent 2.0 1.1 was added to carry out the reaction, whereby 30 of the 3 chloro 2 hydroxypropyl methacrylate component was converted to the acrylic urethane to give a graft copolymerized polymer having photopolymerizable acrylic ester groups at the graft chains this is called GP 3 . The copolymerized polymer chain of methyl methacrylate and dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate constituting the main chain of the GP 3 has a glass transition point of 90 C. By use of the above GP 3, an active energy ray curing resin composition was prepared as follows The resin composition was applied by a wire bar coater on a 16 µm polyethyleneterephthalate film, followed by drying at 100 C for 20 minutes to form a dry film comprising a 75 µm resin composition layer of the present invention. By use of the dry film prepared in Synthetic example 6, following the steps of Fig. 1 to Fig. 6 as described previously in the specification, an on demand type liquid jet recording head having 10 orificcs orifice dimension 75 µm x 50 µm , pitch 0.125 mm with heat generating elements hafnium boride HfB₂ as the discharge energy generating element was prepared as follows. The recording head was prepared in number of 30 respectively of the same shape. First, a plurality of heat generating elements were arranged at the predetermined positions on the substrate comprising silicon and electrodes for applying recording signals were connected to these. Next, an SiO₂ layer thickness 1.0 µm as the protective film was provided on the substrate surface having the heat generating elements arranged thereon, and the surface of the protective layer was cleaned and dried. Then, the dry film with a thickness of 75 µm as shown in the above Synthetic example 6 heated to 80 C was laminated on the protective layer at a speed of 0.4 f min. under the pressurizing condition of 9.81 10⁴ N m² 1 kg cm² . Subsequently, on the dry film provided on the substrate surface, a photomask having a pattern corresponding to the shapes of liquid passages and liquid chamber was superposed and, after performing registration so that the above element may be provided in the liquid passages finally formed, the dry film was exposed to UV ray with an intensity of 12 mW cm² from above the photomask for 30 seconds. Next, the dry film exposed was developed by dipping in 1,1,1 trichloroethane to remove by dissolution the unpolymerized uncured portion of the dry film from the substrate, thereby forming grooves which will become finally the liquid passages and liquid chamber with the cured dry film remaining on the substrate. After completion of development, the cured dry film on the substrate was heated at 150 C for one hour, followed further by irradiation of UV ray with an intensity of 50 mW cm² for 2 minutes to further cure the film. After having formed thus the grooves for the liquid passages and liquid chamber with the cured dry film, a flat plate comprising soda glass provided with a through hole which becomes the covering over the groove formed was applied with an epoxy type resin adhesive to a thickness of 3 µm by spin coating, then preheated to effect B staging and plastered on the cured dry film, further followed by main curing of the adhesive to effect adhesion fixing, thus forming a bonded body. Subsequently, on the downstream side of the liquid passage of the bonded body, namely at the position of 0.150 mm toward the downstream side from the position where the discharge energy generating element is located, the bonded body was cut vertically relative to the liquid passage by means of a commercially available dicing saw trade name DAD 2H 6 model, produced by DISCO Co. to form orifices for discharging the liquid for recording. Finally, the cut surfaces were washed and dried, further smoothend by polishing and feeding pipes for feeding the liquid for recording were mounted at the through holes to complete the liquid jet recording head. Everyone of the recording heads obtained was found to have liquid passages and liquid chamber which have faithfully reproduced the mask pattern and to be excellent in dimensional precision. The orifice dimension was within 50 5 µm and a orifice pitch within 125 5 µm. The recording heads thus prepared were tested for quality and durability during prolonged use as follows. First, for the recording heads obtained durability test was conducted by dipping in the liquids for recording having the respective compositions shown below at 60 C for 1000 hours the environmental conditions comparable to prolonged use of recording head . For each liquid for recording, 5 recording heads were provided for durability test. After the durability test, each head subjected to said test was observed about the bonded state between substrate and the covering and the dry film. As the result, no peel off or damage could be recognized in all of the recording heads, but good adhesiveness was exhibited. Next, separately for the other 10 recording heads obtained, each head was mounted on a recording device, and the printing test was practiced by use of the above liquid for recording by applying recording signals of 10⁸ pulse continuously on the recording head for 14 hours. For each recording head, immediately after initiation of printing and after elapse of 14 hours, substantially no lowering in both of the discharging performance of the liquid for recording and printed state can be recognized. Thus, the recording head was found to be excellent in durability. Recording heads were prepared in the same manner as Example 1 except for using a commercially available dry film Vacrel with a thickness or 75 µm trade name of dry film solder mask, produced by Du Pont de Nemours Co. and a commercially available dry film Photec SR 3000 with a film thickness of 50 µm trade name, produced by Hitachi Kasei Kogyo K.K. . For these recording heads, the same durability test as Example 1 was practiced. In the course of durability test, when employing Vacrel as the dry film, peel off was recognized after 100 hours with the liquids for recolding 2 and 4 . Also, after 300 hours, peel off was recognized with the liquids for recording 1 and 3 . On the other hand, when employing Photec SR 3000 as the dry film, peel off was recognized after 300 hours with a respective liquids for recording of 1 to 4 .
