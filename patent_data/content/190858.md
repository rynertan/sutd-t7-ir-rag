# TEMPERATURE SENSITIVE PROBES

## Abstract
A platinum resistance thermometer comprises a probe 18 connected by wires 19 to a cable 20 . A cylindrical cantilever support member 17 extends well into the space the temperature of which is to be sensed and is formed of a low heat conducting material. The wires 19 are wrapped around the outside of the member 17 . Thus the wires and support member adjacent the probe achieve the ambient temperature. The temperature gradient from the inside of the space to the outside is experienced by the wires and support at a distance from the probe, so avoiding conduction of heat away from the probe and consequent inaccuracy in tempera ture sensing.
