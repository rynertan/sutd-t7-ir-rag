# Method for producing high strength deep drawable dual phase steel sheets.

## Abstract
High strength, deep drawable, steel sheet exhibiting dual phase properties is produced by i initially annealing the sheet to achieve crystallographic textures yielding high deep drawability, ii heating the sheet to a temperature above the A‚ÇÅ for a time sufficient to produce from 2 to 10 austenite, and thereafter iii rapidly cooling to transform at least a portion of the austenite to martensite or bainite. To achieve such transformation of austenite, the composition of the steel must be selected to provide a requisite degree of hardenability.

## Description
DESCRIPTION METHOD FOR PRODUCING HIGH STRENGTH DEEP DRAWABLE DUAL PHASE STEEL SHEETS This invention is directed to a method for the production of dual phase steel sheet or strip products with improved deep drawability. The past decade has seen the development of dual phase steels, characterized by a microstructure which is basically a matrix of ferrite containing from about 10 to 30 martensite or lower bainite. The resulting microstructure provides a steel with an initialIy low yield strength, typically in the range of 50 to 60 ksi, thereby affording ease of formabilityt but which as a result of the strains developed by forming, more closely approaches the ultimate tensile strength of the steel, typically in the range of 80 to 90 ksi. A variety of thermo mechanical processing methods have been proposed for the production of such dual phase steels. In general, these methods involve heating the steel to a temperature in the two phase, alpha gamma region e.g. U. S.Patents 3,502,514 or 3,914,135 or to above the A3 region for a brief period, avoiding undesirable grain growth e.g. U. S. Patents 3,914,135 or 4,033,789 , to produce a minimum amount of austenite which when rapidly cooled will decompose to martensite or bainite. The formability of dual phase steels, coupled with their relatively high strength to weight ratios, have led to the adoption of such steels for the production of automotive parts such as bumpers, wheel racks, brackets primarily as hot rolled products. To date, however, cold rolled, dual phase steels have not been employed for the production of automobile body panels, one reason being that steel sheets for body panel applications must have good deep drawing capabilities.It is recognized that the performance of a steel sheet or strip during deep drawing operations, is closely associated with rm value, which is the ratio of true width strain to true thickness strain when the sheet is strained in tension. Apparently, the r m values of dual phase steel sheets are invariably poor, i.e. around unity see, for example, Hayami et al., Formable HSLA andDual Phase Steels, Conference Proceedings, TMS AIME, 1979, pages 167 to 180 . Thus, in comparison with the solution strengthened, deep drawing steels having r m values of the order of 1.6 to 2.0 and yield strengths of the order of 40 ksi, the presently available, dual phase steels are much inferior. For deep drawing applications, crystallographic texture must be strongly 111 with very little 100 and other undesirable orientations.Although strong 111 textures can be produced successfully in various low carbon sheet steels, development of an equally strong 111 texture in the ferrite martensite aggregate would be much more difficult to accomplish.This is because it is difficult to achieve a sharp texture in martensite due to the nature of the transformation variance. It has now been found that if proper orientations te.g. the predominant 111 texture are first developed or provided to the steel, and if the steel is thereafter briefly intercritically annealed so that local regions with a high carbon content could become austenite pools at the intercritical temperature, these austenized regions will, upon rapid cooling, transform to martensite or bainite without unduly affecting the ferrite matrix if the amount of martensite formed is small. The production of a requisite minimum amount of martensite necessitates that the steel contain at least about 0.02t carbon in uncombined form whereas if the carbon is present in uncombined form, in amounts significantly in excess of 0.15 , the desired deep drawability will not be achieved. Similarly, good deep drawability will not be obtained if manganese is in excess of 0.4 preferably less than 0.3 , or if oxygen is in excess of 500 ppm preferably less than 300 ppm . Steel compositions within the above parameters known to provide good deep drawability, are phosphorus containing or silicon phosphorous containing steels described inU.S. Patent 3,954,516, as well as certain of the compositions described in U.S. Patent 3,827,924, the disclosures of which patents are hereby incorporated by reference.Examples of three such steels were treated in the laboratory to provide an illustration of the properties which could be achieved. The chemical composition of these illustrative steels is provided in Table I below. TABLE IChemical Composition of Air Melted Silicon Phosphorus Steels, Wt.

Although the use of such a shortened soak period will result in some sacrifice of deep drawing texture, it was deemed to be preferential, in order to reduce grain size and thereby attain a more uniform distribution of martensite during the subsequent transformation.After this four hour hold at temperature, the specimens were cooled by removing them from the hot zone to the colder zone of the furnace. This simulated an accelerated cooling rate attainable in box annealing and was intended further to reduce the size of the carbides or pearlite colonies at the grain boundaries. Thus, it was hoped that, upon subsequent intercritical annealing, small austenite pools would form at these regions and thereby be more uniformly distributed throughout the ferrite matrix. Subsequently, to simulate continuous annealing, selected sets of specimens were heat treated in a lead bath at 74O0C, 76O0C, and 78O0C for one minute and thereafter quenched. The resulting mechanical properties of these specimens are reported in Table II. As may be noted from the tabulation under treatment 2 in Table II, the intercritical heat treatment at 740 C followed by quenching in water resulted in substantial increases in the yield and tensile strengths and a corresponding decrease in SI ductility. The yield point elongation or Luders strain in the quenched specimens was appreciably smaller, even though the grain size was slightly smaller and the amount of martensite produced was only about 1 . Although rm values decreased slightly, i.e. to about 1.7, it should nevertheless be noted that at such high strength levels 71 to 76 ksi yield strength and 95 to 100 ksi tensile strength rm values at a level of about 1.7 are quite impressive. For the specimens heat treated at higher intercritical temperatures, i.e. 7600 and 7800C, mechanical properties of microstructural features are summarized under treatments 3 , 4 and 5 in TableII. It can be noted that the yield point elongation was completely eliminated in specimens having higher silicon content, i.e. steels B and C. The amount of martensite in these specimens was substantially higher being about 3 to 4 , than those specimens quenched from 7400C. For Steel A which contained 0.41 silicon, no change of the yield point elongation was observed when the heat treating temperature was increased to 760 or 7800C and the amount of martensite showed only insignificant variations. The r m values, in particular, for the steels having relatively high silicon contents, were in the range 1.7 to 1.85.The yield and tensile strengths of these specimens were in the range 55 to 65 ksi and 75 to 100 ksi, respectively. The change in initial strain hardening rate, resulting from the intercritical heat treatment can be noted by the increase in flow stress after 4 elongation column labeled o0.04 . With the presence of yield point elongation of about 1 to 2 , the increase in flow strength at 4 elongation ranged from 10 to 14 ksi. When the yield point elongation was completely eliminated, the corresponding increase in flow stress ranged from 17 to 20 ksi. Nevertheless, in comparison with properties characteristic of dual phase steels having substantially enriched alloy compositions and greater volume fractions of martensite, the initial strain hardening rate and the total elongation were much lower in the present specimens.However, both ductility and initial strain hardening rate could be improved by changing the steel composition to increase the hardenability, for example, by utilizing elements such as nickel, which would have little or no effect on the annealing texture or the r value. Such increased hardenability would enable the employment of less severe cooling rates from the intercritical anneal, thereby minimizing supersaturation and quenched aging of the ferrite matrix.

Thus, as shown by Matsudo et al., Texture of Crystalline Solids,Volume 3, 1978, pages 53 to 72, when the carbide size is comparatively large, the rm value increases with increasing heating rate.Thus, annealing to produce a high rm value and the subsequent intercritical heat treatment for the production of from about 2 to 10 austenite can be accomplished in one continuous anneal eliminating the separate intercritical heat treatment utilized in the aforementioned examples. In either case, the steel sheet will be annealed to provide a crystallographic texture capable of yielding an rm value greater than 1.5 and prefer ably greater than 1.7. The next heating phase, whether performed as part of the initial anneal for texture formation o as a discrete step, will be conducted for a time and temperature preferably within the range A1 to A3 sufficient to produce from about 2 to 10 austenite, preferably less than 7 austenite. Thereafter, the sheet will be cooled at a rate sufficient to transform all or a major portion of the austenite to martensite or bainite the most preferred range of such decomposition products being about 3 to 5 .
