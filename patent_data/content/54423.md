## Description
DEVICE FOR USE WITH A PERAMBULATOR This invention relates to a device for use with a perambulator to assist in lulling to sleep a baby carried therein. According to the present invention, there is provided a device for use with a perambulator to assist in lulling to sleep a baby carried therein, the device comprising a rotatable means mounted in a housing and being rotated therein to creat vibratory movement, power means to drive said rotatable means, and means to attach said housing to the perambulator thereby to transfer vibratory movement created in the housing to the perambulator. Preferably, the power means is an electric motor mounted on but insulated from at least one wall of said housing. Preferably also, means are provided to adjust the speed of the motor thereby to increase or decrease the rate of vibratory movement. Preferably also, the rotatable means is a wheel, connected to the drive means by a drive belt and means are provided thereon to create a humming noise as the wheel is being rotated. The wheel may be spoked with the spokes and gaps therebetween creating the humming noise as the wheel is rotated alternatively, the wheel may be a disc, having means therein or thereon to create the humming noise during rotation thereof. The means may be either a series of radial vanes projecting outwardly therefrom or a series of spaced apertures therein centred at similar radially spaced intervals from the wheel axis, theVanes or apertures creating the humming noise during rotation of the wheel. Preferably also, the vibratory movement is caused by weight means provided selectively in or on the rotatable wheel to create an imbalance as the wheel is rotated. Preferably further, the means to attach said housing to the perambulator comprises two hooks. An embodiment of the present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a front elevation of a device according to the present invention Fig. 2 is a side elevation Fig. 3 is a front elevation of the device with the front part of a housing removed to reveal the internal aspect of the device and Fig. 4 is a side elevational view with the part of the housing removed to show the internal aspect of the device. Referring to the drawings, a device for use with a perambulator to assist in lulling to sleep a baby carried therein comprises a housing 10 having a front cover 11 securable thereto. Means are provided to attach the housing to a handle 12 of a perambulator said means being in the form of two hooks 13 as shown.The hooks may each incorporate a flexible portion to assist in transferance of the movement. Internally of the housing, a rotatable means in the form of a spoked wheel 14 is mounted on a shaft 15 for low friction rotatable movement. The shaft 15 is journalled in a bearing 9 carried by bracket 16 secured to a mounting 17 which also carries an electric motor 18 forming power means to drive said spoked wheel 14. The outer end of the drive shaft 19 of the motor 18 carries two spaced collars 20 fast therewith and the drive shaft 19 is associated with the spoked wheel by a Vee belt 21 entrained around the drive shaft 19 between the collar 20 and the spoked wheel 14. Weight means 22 in the form of bars are secured to three of the spokes of said spoked wheel 14. The weight means creates an imbalance as the wheel is rotated and thus causes a desired vibratory movement of the housing. Means to create a humming noise during the rotation of the spoked wheel 14 comprises said spokes and gaps therebetween.In an alternative arrangement, the wheel is a disc either having a series of radial vanes projecting out therefrom with the vanes creating a humming noise when the disc is rotated, and three vanes being weighted to create the imbalance which causes the vibratory movement, or the wheel in the form of a disc can also have a series of spaced apertures thereon centred at similar radially spaced intervals from the wheel s axis for example three apertures are provided in one semi circular half of the disc, and the other semi circulator half of the disc one aperture is provided with its centre diametrically opposite to that of the central aperture. A weight can be fitted in said one aperture to create the imbalance in an alternative modification of the latter, the one aperture can be omitted and the weight simply adhered to the disc in the same position. Means not shown are provided to adjust the speed of the motor 18 comprising either a thyristor in circuit with an electrical feed line to the motor 18 and operable to give variable speeds by a manual switching device located outside the housing, or by a resistor to be switched into circuit by a manual switching device to give two speeds the resistor replaced by a svyaostat in circuit and controlled by a manual two way switch. The feed line is a capab 23 passing through the housing and terminating in a plug insertable into a mains electricity supply socket there being a transformer and rectifying and smoothing circuit in the plug to convert input a.c. current from the mains electricity to d.c. current. With the device hooked on to the handle of a perambulator and power flowing to the motor 18, the wheel 14 is rotated creating a humming noise and vibratory movement which is transferred via the hooks 13 to the perambulator. The humming noise is soothing to the baby and the rocking movement of the perambulator lulls the baby to sleep. The speed adjustment to the motor can be used to give different settings if it is found that a slower or faster rate of vibratory movement is more conclusive in lulling a particular baby to sleep. The housing may be of plastics material.
