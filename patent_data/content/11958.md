# DC contactor with solid state arc quenching.

## Abstract
A solid state arc quenching circuit in a high voltage DC contactor, senses initiation of an arc across the contacts of the contactor, commutates a capacitor discharge to the contacts that brings the contact voltage to zero for arc extinction and promptly recharges the capacitor to enable reoperation.
