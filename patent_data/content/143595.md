# Refueling machine mounted fuel assembly inspection T.V. cameras.

## Abstract
A refueling machine 10, 100 within a nuclear reactor facility includes an outer stationary mast 12, 112 upon which are mounted a plurality of light sources 28, 128 , inclined mirrors 36, 136 , and television cameras 24, 124 for scan ning a fuel assembly 32 for the existence of any defects or damage as the fuel assembly 32 is being withdrawn from the reactor core into the stationary mast 12, 112 . In a first embodiment, the light sources 28 , mirrors 36 , and cameras 24 are mounted upon a sleeve 14 clamped about the lower end of the stationary mast 12 , while in a second embodiment, the light sources 128 , mirrors 136 , and cameras 124 are mounted upon a basket type framework 178 which is sus pendingly supported upon the stationary mast 112 by sup port cables 158 . A fixture 176 can support the framework 178 in an off the mast mode so as to permit remote con trolled maintenance or repair of the light sources 128 , mirrors 136 , or cameras 124 . The mirrors 36, 136 may be elimi nated and the light sources re oriented so as to illuminate the reactor core and thereby facilitate the insertion of a fuel as sembly 32 within the reactor core. Television monitors and tape recorder apparatus 168 are disposed upon the refueling machine trolley 150 for remote viewing of the scanned fuel assembly or viewing of the reactor core during an insertion mode of the refueling operation.
