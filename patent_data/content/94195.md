# Solar energy storage materials.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a solar energy storage material comprising N,N bis phenylacetyl indigo dissolved in a polar solvent. When N,N bis phenylacetyl indigo is dissolved in a polar solvent such as acetonitrile, it is possible to store about 60 cal of energy per 1 g of N,N bis phenylacetyl indigo, and the half life period of isomerization from cis to trans from in acetonitrile at 17 C is 1,264 minutes, which is also a satisfactory value for practical application.
