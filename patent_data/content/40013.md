# CONTINUOUS SHIRRING AND SPINNING MACHINE FOR CASINGS

## Abstract
This relates to a machine for shirring tubular films such as those used for sausage casings. The films are continuously fed onto a mandrel where they are opened from their flat state and then are fed at a selected rate through a shirring head. The shirred casing is then gripped and advanced in a manner so as to control the density thereof and to impart a spin thereto as desired. The shirred casing, while being spun, is gripped by a pair of cooperating units and a leading portion of the shirred casing is separated at predetermined spacings into individual strands which are then fed along the mandrel individually and are compressed and doffed from the mandrel into a strand handler which then presents each strand to an end closer and thereafter deposits the closed strand on a receiving tray. A mandrel clamp assembly supports the mandrel and intro duces liquid and air into the mandrel, and includes a sealing sleeve and a mandrel positioning pin. A control shaft is formed in sections and each shaft section other than a starting section is supported by a single bearing. Adjacent ends of the shaft sections are formed with projecting half circular cross sectional portions which are overlapped and then are clamped together by a radially expanding wedge device dis posed within a sleeve encircling the shaft portions. An apparatus is provided for treating a separated strand of shir red casing. The strand is fed along the mandrel and a stop member is positioned transversely of the mandrel adjacent a free end thereof, after which the trailing end of the strand is engaged by a shaping device which, as it advances toward the stop to compress the strand, is oscillated or rotated also to dress the trailing end of the strand. When the stop is opened, the same member is used to doff the strand from the mandrel. The control shaft controls the timed operation of various components of the machine. The control shaft is driven by a primary drive unit of the machine through a quick change gear unit and an adjustable drive connection so as to vary the functions of the machine primarily for the purpose of varying the lengths of strands of shirred casing produced by the machine. There is a drive mechanism of the rack and pinion type wherein the length of the rack is less than the required travel and there are plural drive pinions which singly and then sequentially engage the rack. The drive pinions may be driven in any manner, but when a variation in speed is desired in addition to reciprocation, it has been found that a cam type drive will provide the desired mechanical movement. The rack may be beneficially used to effect the controlled movement of a shirred casing strand along a mandrel. A gripper separator unit separates continuously shirred casings into individual strands. The gripper is provided with hold back blades which engage the shirred casing while the separator is provided with like blades which engage the shirred casing substantially in the same plane as the gripper blades. The separator is then rapidly moved away from the gripper so as to snap the casing at the point of engagement by the blades. Suitable drives are provided for separately reciprocating the gripper and the separator and various drives are provided for positioning the blades. When the casing is being spun, the separator and the gripper are spun in unison therewith.
