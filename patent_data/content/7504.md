# Bubble domain relational data base system.

## Abstract
A bubble domain chip 10 is designed to provide the components necessary to perform all essential data base functions. Many cross linked loops L11, L12, ..., Lnm in paral lel allow the interchange of distinct columns of information. The use of an on chip decoder 34 achieves effective inter changeability of distinct rows of information, Thus, the basic storage structure and access modes conform to the high level view of data implied by the relational data model, resulting in simpler programming. In addition, a plurality of comparators 28, 30 are provided to the plurality of storage loops to per form context search simultaneously on all the loops. The simultaneous search and the restriction of output to only qualified data greatly reduces the query time.
