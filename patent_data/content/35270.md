## Description
The present invention relates to heterocyclic compounds which are useful in medicine, to the preparation of such compounds, pharmaceutical formulations containing them, and their use in medicine. It has been found that pyrazolidinones as further defined below in formula I and their corresponding acid addition salts, have anorectic properties and are useful in the control of appetite in mammals, including man. The anorectic properties of the pyrazolidinones have been demonstrated by their ability to suppress the weight increase which usually occurs in normal rats, and in some instances to effect a decrease in the body weight of such rats. A disadvantage of amphetamine and amphetamine like anorectic agents currently in use is their stimulant effect on the central nervous system resulting in undesirable side effects such as nervousness and insomnia. In addition, some amphetamine like compounds such as dexamphetamine and phenmetrazine have been found to cause euphoria and a consquent tendency to dependence on such drugs by the user. The pyrazolidinones of the present invention are structurally unrelated to amphetamine and have not shown a comparable stimulant action on the central nervous system. The anorectic effect of the pyrazolidinones is also more persistent and less susceptible to tolerance than that of fenfluoramic.In formula I wherein R1 is straight alkyl having from 7 to 13 carbon atoms. Appropriate reactants and reaction conditions for reducing a compound of formula II will be known to those skilled in the art and include catalytic hydrogenation using for example Raney nickel or a noble metal catalyst such as platinum or palladium.If desired the hydrogen may be employed at a greater than atmospheric pressure to facilitate the reaction and the reaction is preferably carried out using an inert solvent. Suitable solvents include hydrocarbons such as hexane or toluene, and lower alkanols such as methanol or ethanol. Alternatively the compounds of formula 11 may be reduced using conventional reducing agents such as sodium cyanoborohydride or nascent hydrogen which may for example be obtained by reacting iron, zinc or tin in an acid such as hydrochloric acid or acetic acid, or sodium in ethanol. The intermediates of formula n may readily be obtained by reacting 3 pyrazolidone, or preferably an acid addition salt thereof such as the hydrochloride, with an appropriate aldehyde of formula III EMI2.1 wherein R1 has the same meaning as in formula 11 . Although the aldehyde and 3 pyrazolidone may react directly, the reaction is facilitated by the presence of a dehydrating agent such as phosphorous pentoxide in ether or by the use of azeotropic distillation or molecular sieves. It is not necessary to isolate the compound of formula II and conveniently this compound is prepared in situ and the reaction medium then used directly for reduction to provide the desired compound of formula I . wherein Rl is straight alkyl having from 7 to 13 carbon atoms. Appropriate reactants and reaction conditions for reducing a compound of formula II will be known to those skilled in the art and include catalytic hydrogenation using for example Raney nickel or a noble metal catalyst such as platinum or palladium.If desired the hydrogen may be employed at a greater than atmospheric pressure to facilitate the reaction and the reaction is preferably carried out using an inert solvent. Suitable solvents include hydrocarbons such as hexane or toluene, and lower alkanols such as methanol or ethanol. Alternatively the compounds of formula II may be reduced using conventional reducing agents such as sodium cyanoborohydride or nascent hydrogen which may for example be obtained by reacting iron, zinc or tin in an acid such as hydrochloric acid or acetic acid, or sodium in ethanol. The intermediates of formula 11 may readily be obtained by reacting 3 pyrazolidone, or preferably an acid addition salt thereof such as the hydrochloride, with an appropriate aldehyde of formula III EMI3.1 wherein R1 has the same meaning as in formula II . Although the aldehyde and 3 pyrazolidone may react directly, the reaction is facilitated by the presence of a dehydrating agent such as phosphorous pentoxide in ether or by the use of azeotropic distillation or molecular sieves. It is not necessary to isolate the compound of formula II and conveniently this compound is prepared in situ and the reaction medium then used directly for reduction to provide the desired compound of formula I . The pyrazolidinones of formula I may also be prepared by alkylation of the pyrazolidone ring. That is, pyrazolidinone or an acid addition salt thereof is reacted with an alkylating agent which may be designated as a reactive ester derivative of an alcohol R.OH wherein R has the same meaning as in formula I . Suitable reactive ester derivatives include halide e.g. chloride, bromide or iodide and sulphonate esters such as p toluenesulphonate, methanesulphonate, benzenesulphonate and naphthalensulphonate esters. The reaction may be performed in the absence of a solvent but preferably in an inert solvent such as an alkanol e.g. methanol , an aromatic hydrocarbon e.g. benzene or toluene , an aliphatic ketone e.g. acetone or methyl ethyl ketone , dioxan, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylsulphoxide, acetonitrile or dimethylformamide.Although the reaction may proceed without heating, elevated temperatures up to the reflux temperature of the reaction medium may be used and optionally under pressure. A further means for preparing the desired compounds of formula I is formation of the pyrazolidinone ring, for example by cyclisation of a carboxylic acid of formula IV EMI4.1 wherein R is as defined in formula I , or a reactive derivative thereof such as an acid halide, in particular the acid chloride or bromide, an acid anhydride, a lower alkyl ester or lower alkylthio ester wherein the alkyl group has 1 to 4 carbon atoms for example methyl or ethyl, or other activated ester such as an ester of N hydroxysuccinamide or an aryl ester such as that with p nitrophenol or thiophenol. Suitable reaction conditions are similar to those used for the analogous formation of an amide and will be known to those skilled in the art. For example, the reaction may be effected under acidic or neutral conditions desirable with heating and in the presence of an inert solvent such as are mentioned above.The reaction may be promoted by use of a coupling agent such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. Conveniently, the reaction conditions for the preparation of the compound of formula IV are chosen such that it cyclises spontaneously without prior isolation. For example, a compound of formula IV may be obtained by reducing a compound of formula V EMI5.1 wherein R has the same meaning as in formula I , or a corresponding reactive derivative thereof. Any reducing agent appropriate for this type of reaction may be used, for example those mentioned above for reducing a compound of formula II , or acidic stannous chloride in a suitable solvent such as an alkanol e.g. ethanol, or aluminium analgam which may be employed in the presence of an alkanol or benzene alkanol solvent. The reactants should of course be chosen to be compatible with the compound of formula V , for example aluminium amalgam is in appropriate for reducing the parent acid and should only be used for reducing a corresponding reactive derivative. Intermediate compounds of formula V are conveniently prepared by reacting nitrous acid with a secondary amine of formula VI EMI6.1 wherein R is as defined in formula 11 , or a reactive derivative thereof the reaction being effected with cooling, at a temperature not exceeding 50C. The secondary amines of formula VI are readily obtained by reacting an appropriate acrylate ester with a primary amine of formula RNH2. Intermediates of formula IV may also be prepared by the reaction of an acrylate salt or ester with a compound of formula VII H2H.NH.R VII wherein R is as defined in formula . The reaction is preferably carried out in an alcoholic solution and at a temperature not exceeding 10 C. As a further example, 3 pyrazolidinones of formula I may be prepared by hydrolysis of a corresponding 3 iminopyrazolidine or tautomeric 3 aminopyrazoline of formulae VIIIA and VIIIB respectively.EMI6.2 wherein R is as defined in formula I . The hydrolysis may be achieved by heating in the presence of a dilute mineral acid or by steam distillation. The compounds of formulae VIII may be prepared by methods analogous to those described above for the preparation of pyrazolidinones of formula I by reduction of a compound of formula II or by reaction of acrylonitrile with a compound of formula VII . A compound of formula I may be isolated as the base or corresponding acid addition salt thereof and it will be appreciated that a base so obtained may be converted to an acid addition salt thereof, or an acid addition salt may be converted to the desired base or salt by conventional techniques. The compounds of formula I may be used to control appetite or bodyweight in mammals such as mice, rats, dogs and cats, and more importantly man. They are of particular value in controlling and reducing obesity and, as such, they are useful in the prophylaxis of adverse conditions associated with obesity such as coronary artery disease, hypertension and maturity onset diabetes. The effective anorectic dose in a particular situation will depend on the compound chosen, the recipient, the mode of administration and the severity of the condition to be treated, but will generally lie in the range if from 10 to 200 mg kg bodyweight per day. A convenient intravenous dose is from 10 to 30 mg kg, and an oral dose is preferably from 25 to 125 mg kg bodyweight.Administration of the desired daily dose is preferably in three divided doses.For example, convenient forms of administration include tablets each containing from 100 to 500 mg of compound of formula 1 . For use in medicine the compounds of formula I may be administered as a pure chemical but are preferably presented with an acceptable carrier there for as a pharmaceutical formulation. The carrier must of course be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient of the formulation. The carrier may be a solid or a liquid or a mixture of solid and liquid substances, and is preferably formulated with a compound of formula I as a unit dose formulation, for example a tablet, capsule or cachet for oral administration or a suppository for rectal administration. Other pharmaceutically active substances may also be present in formulations of the present invention, and the formulation may be formulated by any of the well known techniques of pharmacy consisting basically of admixture of its components.Unit dose formulations, for oral, rectal or parenteral administration vid. inf. conveniently contain a compound of formula I in an amount in the range frim 10 mg to 500 mg. For oral administration, fine powders or granules of the compounds may contain diluents and dispersing and surface active agents, and may be presented in a draught in water or in a syrup, in capsules or cachets in the dry state or in an aqueous or non aqueous suspension, when a suspending agent may also be included in tablets, preferably made from granules of the active ingredient with a diluent, by compression with binders and lubricants or in a suspension in water or a syrup or an oil in a water oil emulsion, when flavouring, preserving, suspending, thickening and emulsifying agents may also be included.The granules or the tablets may be coated, and the tablets may be scored. For parenteral administration by intramuscular or intraperitoneal injection , the compounds may be presented in unit dose or multi dose containers in aqueous or non aqueous injection solutions which may contain antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the compounds isotonic with the blood, or in aqueous or non aqueous suspensions when suspending agents and thickening agents may also be included extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be made from sterile powders, granules or tablets which may contain diluents, dispersing and surface active agents, binders and lubricants.
