# Semiconductor memory device.

## Abstract
A dynamic random access memory RAM is disclosed which has memory cell units 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 formed on a silicon substrate 30 , each of which includes four memory cells, each of these including a MOS transistor Q and MOS capacitor C . One cell unit 10 occupies a substantially square area A1 of the surface of the substrate 30 . The four memory cells included in this cell unit 10 are arranged along the diagonal lines of the square area in the shape of a cross. The four transistors Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 are connected to a common drain through a common drain region. The capacitors C1, C2, C3, C4 are respectively arranged at the four corners of the square area A1 so as to have a relatively increased capacitor area, thereby obtaining a large capaci tance.
