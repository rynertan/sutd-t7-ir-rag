# Two stage high resolution digital to analog converter.

## Abstract
A 16 bit D A converter formed on a single monolithic IC chip and having two cascaded stages 20, 22 each includ ing a 256 R resistor string DAC. The first stage 20 employs a switch selector system 32, 34 capable of selecting any two adjacent taps of the resistor string to produce a seg ment voltage to be applied across the second stage resistor string 26 . The resistor strings 24, 26 are formed as elon gate thin film strips configured as a single, unbent body having integral voltage tap nipples evenly spaced along both sides of the strip. Buffer amplifiers between the cas caded stages incorporate NMOS and PMOS cascoded bi polar current sources in a non epitaxial structure on a P type substrate.
