# An arrangement in industrial trucks.

## Abstract
An arrangement in industrial trucks of the kind which include a chassis 3 carried by support wheels 5, 6 which lack spring suspension, and driven by a sprung drive wheel 7 arranged between two support wheels. A hydraulically operable load carrying device 2 is provided for lifting priari ly goods laden pallets. The sprung movement of the drive wheel 7 relative to the chassis is effected with the aid of a spring means 22 which includes link arms 25, 26 and a spring 24 both being arranged between the chassis and the drive wheel. Said spring 24 comprises a hydraulic working piston cylinder device 27 by means of which the spring means can be given a desired spring bias or spring force. The piston cylinder device is connected to the hydraulic sys tem of the load carrying device in a manner to increase auto matically the spring bias, and therewith the pressure exerted by the drive wheel against the floor or like surface when the load carried increases.
