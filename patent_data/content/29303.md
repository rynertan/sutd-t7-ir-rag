## Description
This invention relates to novel heterocyclic derivatives having action on histamine receptors, to processes for the preparation thereof, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use in therapeutics. Certain novel heterocyclic derivatives have now been found which have potent activity as 112 antagonists. These compounds, which are more particularly described below, for example show inhibition of the secretion of gastric acid when this is stimulated via histamine receptors Ash and Schild, Brit. J. Pharmacol. Chemother, 1966, 27, 427 . Their ability to do so can be demonstrated in the perfused rat stomach using the method described in German Offenlegungsschrift No.2,734,070, modified by the use of sodium pentobarbitone 50 mg kg as anaesthetic instead of urethane, and in conscious dogs equipped with Heideiihain pouches using the method described by Black et al, Nature 1972 236, 385. Furthermore the compounds antagonise the effect of histamine on the contraction frequency of isolated guinea pig right atrium but do not modify histamine induced contractions of isolated gastro intestinal smooth muscle which are mediated via Il1 receptors. Compounds with histamine lI2 blocking activity may be used in the treatment of conditions where there is an advantage in lowering gastric acidity particularly in gastric and peptic ulceration, as a prophylactic measure in surgical procedures, and in the treatment of allergic and inflammatory conditions where histamine is a known mediator. Thus they may be used for example, either alone, or in combination with other active ingredients in the treatment of allergic and iiiflammatorv conditions of the skin. The present invention provides compounds of the general formula I EMI2.1 and physiologically acceptable salts, hydrates and bioprecursors thereof, in which R1 represents a heteroaralkyl group or a C11 16 straight or branched saturated or unsaturated alkylene chain optionally substituted by a hydroxy group or R1 represents a C1 16 straight or branched saturated or unsaturated alkylene chain substituted by an ester group C02R5 or an amide group CONH2, where R5 is a C13 alkyl group, or R1 represents a Cl Cl6 straight or branched saturated or unsaturated alkylene chain interrupted by an oxygen atom, a sulphur atom, a sulphoxide group, a sulphone group, an amide group CONH or NHCO or an ester group C0 0 or 0 CO , with the provisos that R1 does not represent a C1 6 alkyl group substituted by a C1 6 a lkoxy group and that when the alkylene chain is interrupted by an oxygen or sulphur atom or a sulphoxide, amide CONH or ester COO group there must be at least two carbon atoms between that group and the nitrogen atom to which R1 is attached R2 represents hydrogen or a C14 alkyl group Alk represents a straight or branched alkylene chain of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms Q represents a furan or thiophen ring in which incorporation into the rest of the molecule is through bonds at the 2 and 5 positions, the furan ring optionally bearing a further substituent 116 adjacent to the group R1R2NAlk , or Q represents a benzene ring in which incorporation into the rest of the molecule is through bonds at the 1 and 3 or 1 alld 4 positions R6 represents halogen, or C1 4 alkyl which may be substituted by hydroxy or C1 4 alkoxy X represents CH2 , O , S , or NH n represents zero, 1 or 2 m represents 2, 3 or 4 R3 represents hydrogen, alkyl, alkenyl, aralkyl,C2 6 alkyl substituted by hydroxy or alkoxy and R4 represents hydrogen, alkyl, alkenyl, aralkyl, hydroxyalkyl, acyloxyalkyl, alkoxyalkyl, aryloxyalkyl, aralkyloxyalkyl, aminoalkyl, alkylaminoalkyl, dialkylaminoalkyl, hydroxy or alkoxy or the groupNR7R8 where R7 represents hydrogen, alkyl, alkyl substituted by hydroxy or C1 3 alkoxy, alkenyl, aralkyl or heteroaralkyl and 118 represents any of the groups defined for R7 or may represent the group COR9 whereRg represents hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, alkoxy, heteroaryl or monocyclic heteroaralkyl or 118 represents the group S02R10 where R10 represents alkyl or aryl, or R8 represents the group C NHR11 where Y is oxygen or sulphur and Y Rll represents hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl or aralkyl, or R7 and R8 taken together may represent the group CR12Rl3 where 1112 represents aryl or heteroaryl and R15 represents hydrogen or alkyl with the proviso that when X is NH then n is zero. The term alkyl as a group or part of a group means that the.group is straight or branched and has unless otherwise stated preferably 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and in particular I to 4 carbon atoms, e.g. methyl or ethyl and the term alkenyl means that the group has preferably 3 to 6 carbonlatoms. The term cycloalkyl means that the group has 3 to 8 carbon atoms. The acyl portion of an acyloxyalkyl group means an aroyl, aralkanoyl or C16 alkanoyl group. Examples of acyloxyalkyl groups include acetoxymethyl, formyloxymethyl, benzyloxymethyl and phenylacetoxyme thyl. The term unsaturated in relation to the alkylene chain within H1 means that the chain contains at least one C Cor C C grouping.The term aryl as a group or part of a group preferably means phenyl or substituted phenyl, for example phenyl substituted with one or moreC1 3 alkyl or C13 alkoxy groups or halogen atoms, e.g. fluorine. The term heteroaryl11 as a group or part of a group within the definition of R7 and R8 generally means a 5 or 6 membered monocyclic unsaturated ring which may contain one or more heteroatoms selected from oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur, e.g. furyl, pyridyl, thiazolyl, or thienyl. The term heteroaralkyl as applied to the group R1 means that the group is made up of a heterocyclic part which is a monocyclic or bicyclic unsaturated ring which may be unsubstituted or substituted, and an alkyl part which is a straight or branched C1 4 alkyl chain. The ring may contain from 5 to 10 atoms selected from carbon, oxygen, nitrogen or sulphur and the ring is linked to the alkyl part either through carbon or nitrogen.When the ring is substituted the substituent is selected from C13 alkyl, C13 alkoxy, hydroxy, hydroxyalkyl, aminoalkyl, alkylaminoalkyl, dialkylaminoalkyl and halogen. If the heterocyclic ring is monocyclic it preferably contains 5 or 6 members and if it is bicyclic it preferably contains 9 or 10 members. Examples of such heteroaralkyl groups are those in which the heterocyclic portion is a furyl, thienyl, pyrrolyl, pyridinyl, pyrimidinyl, triazinyl, oxazolyl, triazolyl, thiazolyl, isoquinolinyl, quinolinyl or indolyl ring and the alkylene portion is a methylene, ethylene or propylene grouping. When R1 represents an optionally substituted alkylene chain this may for example be saturated and contain up to 16 carbon atoms, or be substituted by or interrupted by an optional amide or ester grouping. The invention includes the compounds of formula I in the form of physiologically acceptable salts with inorganic and organic acids. Particularly useful salts include hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, sulphates, methanesulphonates, acetates, maleates, succinates, citrates, tartrates, benzoates and fumarates. The compounds of formula I and their salts may also form hydrates, which hydrates are also to be considered as part of the invention. The compounds of formula I can exhibit tautomerism and the formula is intended to cover all tautomers. Where optical isomers may exist the formula is intended to cover all diastereoisomers and optical enantiomers.The term bioprecursors as used herein means compounds which have a structure different to that of the compounds of formula I but which, upon administration to an animal or human being, are converted in the body into a compound of formula I . The compounds according to the invention, preferably in the form of a salt, may be formulated for administration in any convenient way and the invention includes within its scope pharmaceutical compositions containing at least one compound according to the invention adapted for use in human or veterinary medicine. Such compositions may be formulated in a conventional manner using one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients.Such compositions may also contain if required other active ingredients, e.g. R1 antagonists. Thus the compounds according to the invention may be formulated for oral, buccal, topical, parenteral or rectal administration. Oral administration is preferred. For oral administration, the pharmaceutical composition may take the form of for example, tablets, capsules, powders, solutions, syrups or suspensions prepared by conventional means with acceptable excipients. i or buccal administration the composition may take tile form of tablets or lozenges formulated in conventional manner. The compounds of the invention may be formulated for parenteral administration by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form in ampoules, or in multi dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formula tory agents such as suspending, stabilising and or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for reconstitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g. sterile pyrogen free water before use. The compounds of the invention may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g. containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glyceride. For topical application, the compornids of the invention may be formulated as ointments, creams, gels, lotions, powders or sprays in conventional manner. For internal administration a convenient daily dosage regime of the compounds according to the invention would be 1 to 4 doses to the total of some 5 mg to 2 g per day, preferably 5 to 500 mg per day, dependent upon the condition of tie patient.

According to one aspect the invention provides compounds of formula I in which R1 represents a heteroaralkyl group and R4 represents NR7R8 where R7 and 118 each represent hydrogen, alkyl, alkyl substituted by hydroxy or C13 alkoxy, alkenyl, aralkyl or heteroaralkyl or R7 and 118 together reprosent CR12R13 where R12 represents aryl er htercaryl and R13 reprsents hydrogen or alkyl. According to another aspect the invention provides compounds of formula I in which R1 is other than a heteroaralkyl group and R4 represents NR7R8 where R7 and 118 each represent hydrogen, alkyl, alkyl substituted by hydroxy or C1 3 alkoxy, alkenyl, aralkyl or heteroaralkyl or R7 and 118 together represent CR12Rl3 where R12 represents aryl or heteroaryl and 1113 represents hydrogen or alkyl. It will be appreciated in the methods for the preparation of compounds of formula I given below, that for certain reaction steps it may be necessary to protect various reactive substituents in the starting materials for a particular reaction and subsequently to remove the protecting group. Such protection and subsequent deprotection may be particularly pertinent where R1 and or R2 in intermediates used to prepare compounds of formula I are hydrogen atoms and or when R3 in intermediates is an alkyl group bearing a hydroxy substituent and or when R4 in certain intermediates is a free amino group. Standard protection and deprotection procedures can be employed for example formation of phthalimide in the case of primary amines , benzyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, or trichloroe thoxycarbonyl derivatives.Subsequent cleavage of the protection group is achieved by conventional procedures. Thus a phthalimide group may be cleaved by treatment with a hydrazine e.g. hydrazine hydrate or a primary amine for example methylamine benzyl or benzyloxycarbonyl derivatives may be cleaved by hydrogenolysis in the presence of a catalyst, e.g.palladium, and trichloroethoxycarbonyl derivatives may be cleaved by treatment with zinc dust. In describing the processes which may be used in preparing compounds of formula I or intermediates used in the preparation thereof, any of R1 to R13, Alk,Q, X, n and m are as defined in formula I unless otherwise stated. Compounds of formula I where Alk represents C112 and in which R4 is other than the group N CR12Rl3 may be prepared by reducing the intermediate formed from reacting a compound of formula III EMI12.1 in which W represents the group CIlO with a reagent H1H2NR. Reaction may be effected by treatment with ammonia or an amine R1R2NE in a solvent e.g. tetrahydrofuran or an alkanol such as ethanol or methanol, followed by reduction e.g. with a hydride reducing agent such as an alkali or alkaline earth metal borohydride e.g. sodium borohydride, or aluminium hydride or lithium aluminium hydride or with hydrogen and a metal catalyst e.g. palladilun or platinum. Alternatively, for the production of compounds of formula I in which Alk is C1 6 alkylene group and R4 is other than the group N CR12R13, a compound of formula IV EMI13.1 may be reacted with an aldehyde RlCHO under the reducing conditions described above the group R1 having a meaning such that the resultant R1CH2 represents a group R1 as defined above. Compounds of formula I may also be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula IV above with an appropriate halo compound such as a hetercaralkyl halide e.g. 2 furylmethyl chloride . Compounds of formula I in which ItZl represents the group N CR12R13 may be prepared from compounds of formula I in which R4 represents M12 by reaction with an aldehyde or ketone R12R13CO in a solvent such as benzene, ethanol or methanol. The reaction is preferably carried out with heating, e.g. at reflux. Compounds of formula I in which R4 is an acyloxyalkyl group may be prepared by treating the corresponding hydroxyalkyl compound with an appropriate acid, e.g. acetic or henzoie acid at eievated temperatures e.g. 80 102 C in the absence or presence of a solvent such as toluene. Compounds of formula I in which 114 is the group NR7R8 where R8 is COR9, S02R10 or C Y NHR11 may be prepared by treating an amino triazole V EMI14.1 in which R1,R2,R3 and R7 are as defined in formula I or are groups readily convertible thereto with a reagent capable of replacing the hydrogen atom in the group NHR7 by the group 118 where R8 is as defined in formula I . Thus for example the aminotriazole V may be reacted with an activated derivative of either a carboxylic acid R9COOH or a sulphonic acid R10SO3H or the aminotriazole V may be reacted with an isocyanate or isothiocyanate R 11NCY in which R11 has any of the meanings defined for R11 in formula I except hydrogen or represents an alkali metal atom such as potassium or sodium or an alkoxycarbonyl group, e.g. ethoxycarbonyl, to give a compound of formula I in which R8 is respectively the group COR9, SO2R10 or C1 NR R11.Y Suitable activated derivatives include acid halides e.g. acid chlorides, alkylchloroformates, acid anhydrides including mixed anhydrides e.g. acetic formic anhydride , or esters such as alkyl esters, ortho esters and l alkyl 2 pyridinyl esters. The reaction with an acid halide is preferably carried out in the presence of a base e.g. an inorganic base such as sodium hydroxide or an organic base such as triethylamine or pyridine. The reaction with an alkylchloroformate is preferably carried out in the presence of a base, e.g. potassium carbonate or triethylamine, in a solvent such as dimetilylformamide. The reaction with an acid anhydride may be carried out in the absence or presence asolvent such as pyridine. In the reaction with an isocyanate or isothiocyanate, compounds of formula I in which Rll is other than hydrogen are conveniently prepared by carrying out the reaction in a solvent such as acetonitrile at an elevated temperature, e.g. reflux. Compounds of formula I in which R is hydrogen may be prepared by heating the aminotriazole V with an appropriate organicisocyanate or isothiocyanate such as ethylcarbonisothiocyanatidate, at an elevated temperature followed by hydrolysis of the resulting ester, for example with a base such as aqueous ethanolic sodium hydroxide. Compounds of formula I in which R1 is an alkylene chain interrupted by an amide grouping may be prepared by heating a compound of formula I in which R1 is an alkylene chain substituted by an ester grouping C02R5 i.e. R1 is the group n500C CH2 x with an amine CH3 CH2 yNH2 to give a compound of formula I in whichR1 is the group CH3 CH2 yNHCO CII2 where x and y are integers and the total of x and y is not greater than 15. Intermediates of formulae III and IV may in general be prepared by the methods referred to inBritish patent specification No. 2023133A and inEuropean Patent specification publication No. 0016565. Where the product of any of the above processes is a free base and a salt is required, the salt may be formed in a conventional manner. Thus for example, a generally convenient method of forming the salts is to mix appropriate quantities of the free base and the acid in an appropriate solvent s e.g. an alcohol such as ethanol or an ester such as ethyl acetate.
