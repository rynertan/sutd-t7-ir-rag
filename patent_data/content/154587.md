## Description
Hepatitis A is a liver disease which, although not commonly fatal, can induce long periods of debilitating illness. The disease is commonly spread by direct contact with an infected individual or by hepatitis A virus HAV contaminated drinking water and or food. The prior art does not identify the protein or proteins of HAV hepatitis A virus which induce neutralizing antibodies to this virus. One of the major drawbacks to examining the protective antigenicity of HAV proteins has been the lack of sufficient quantities of HAV and its polypeptide components. The virus is made in very small quantities in cell culture, has a limited animal host range, and is difficult to purify from infected cell cultures and animal tissues. Recently a patent application claiming the VP 1 structural protein of HAV prepared by isolation from the virus was filed by the assignee of this application and is presently copending as U.S.S.N. 541,836, filed October 14, 1983 See EP A 0138 704 . VP 1 is recognized in our laboratories as being the main structural protein of HAV, and accordingly the most important for vaccine use. The appropriate dosage forms and regions are in this application, which is incorporated by reference. Cloning of the genomic material of HAV and potential analysis of its sequence has recently been reported Von Der Helm et al., J. Virological Methods The Von de Helm work describes preparation of cDNA and cloning of that cDNA into plasmids, and subsequent expression of HAV antigen, but no nucleotide sequence of the DNA or amino acid sequence of the corresponding proteins is described, nor is the identity of any of the viral proteins expressed known. In fact, the weak antigenic responses of the viral proteins obtained by Von de Helm et al. tend to indicate that most portions of the HAV genomic encoding the important antigenic proteins of HAV has not been successfully identified or used in the cloning experiments. Ticehurst does report a partial nucleotide sequence from the 3 terminus of HAV, but does not appear to have identified that part of the sequence which encodes for the antigenic proteins. From our experiments, we believe that Ticehurst has not sequenced the antigenic portion that the Ticehurst sequence work is far outside the antigenic region. It is an object of the present invention to provide a method for cloning the nucleotide sequences of HAV encoding the major antigenic proteins of HAV, including VP 1, VP 2, VP 3 and VP 4, especially VP 1. Another object is to determine the nucleotide sequences which encode the antigenic proteins, including VP 1. Yet another object is to provide a method for producing VP 1, VP 2, VP 3, VP 4, or parts thereof, by expression of cloned DNA in an appropriate host. Still another object is to provide a vector containing the VP 1, VP 2, VP 3 or VP 4 genes, or parts thereof, but especially a vector containing the VP 1, or part of VP 1, gene. Another object is to provide transformed hosts containing a vector containing the VP 1, VP 2, VP 3 or VP 4 genes, or parts thereof and being capable of expressing the peptide encoded by said genes or parts thereof. These and other objects of the present invention will be apparent from the following description. Fragments of DNA which code for immunogenic peptides VP 1, VP 2, VP 3 and VP 4 capable of inducing RNA was extracted from purified hepatitis A virus particles, annealed to a dT tailed plasmid, and the complementary cDNA synthesized. This single stranded DNA was used as a template for synthesis of its complementary strand using DNA polymerase. The double stranded cDNA thus formed corresponded to at least a portion of the HAV antigenic protein genes. It was modified to provide sticky ends and placed into an appropriate vector suitable hosts include prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. These hosts were exposed to the resulting vector and those which stably incorporated the vector were identified and isolated. Vector DNA was extracted from these hosts and this material was characterized. At least 5 fragments of cloned HAV DNA were sequenced to determine the nucleotide sequence of the region encoding the antigenic peptides, VP 1, VP 2, VP 3 and VP 4. The corresponding amino acid sequence encoded thereby was inferred. Knowledge of the nucleotide sequences encoding the amino acid sequences of these peptides makes possible their synthesis as well as subunits and homologues and analogues thereof thus allowing determination of the relationship between structure and function. The peptides, which as noted above, do not form part of this invention, can be used in pharmaceutical compositions to make vaccines. The HAV peptides of the present invention may be prepared from their constituent amino acids by standard methods of protein synthesis, e.g., Schroeder The peptides of HAV also may be prepared by recombinant DNA techniques by, for example, the isolation or preparation of appropriate DNA sequences and incorporation of these sequences into vectors in a suitable host and expression of the desired peptide therefrom. The use of recombinant DNA techniques is described in many published articles, for example, Maniatis Suitable hosts for expression of the HAV peptides include prokaryotic organisms such as The following examples illustrate the present invention. The initial 3 cDNA clones were prepared using the procedure of H. Okayama and P. Berg The largest viral insert obtained was approximately 2.3Kb in size and was called clone α 18. Restriction enzyme analysis of this clone demonstrated the presence of two Pvu II sites near the 5 end of the cloned insert. The cloned DNA was restricted with Pvu II and the 280 bp 5 proximal fragment was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, visualized by ethidium bromide staining and electroeluted in dialysis tubing for use as a primer for further cDNA cloning. To insure the cDNA clones were generated from Hepatitis A genetic information, the clones were labeled with ³²P α dCTP by nick translation and hybridized to uninfected and HAV infected LLC MK2 cellular RNA bound to nitrocellulose membrane filters. The cDNA clones hybridized only to the HAY infected cell RNA. The cloned cDNAs were analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion and by cross hybridization of the clones to one another in order to locate the relative positions of five clones, T28 18, T28 123, T28 94, T28 71 and T28 77, as shown in Fig. 1. From this analysis one can deduce that over 90 of the viral genome has been cloned in overlapping cDNA clones starting at the 3 end of the genome. The restriction enzyme map of the HAV genome is that line marked HAV in Fig. 1. The location of the structural proteins on the polio genome is also shown in Fig. 1 as an indication of the probable predicted position on the HAY genome, since polio and HAV are related viruses. DNA sequencing has been performed by two methods. Chemical DNA sequencing has been performed by the Maxam and Gilbert technique on clones T28 18, T28 123, T28 77, T28 94 and T28 71. Subclones of fragments of cDNA clone T28 77 were prepared in M13 phage and sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide termination procedure described by Sanger. In all, a region of 3000 contiguous bases have been sequenced. This region contains the sequences which encode the two structural proteins VP 1 and VP 3 of HAV and the other proteins VP 2, and VP 4. The proteins VP 1 and VP 3 are the major antigenic proteins VP 2 and VP 4 are thought to be less valuable as antigens. The amino acid sequence of a mixture of cyanogen bromide cleavage fragments generated from purified VP 3 protein covered in copending USSN 541,836, supra has been compared to the translation of the DNA sequence to more precisely locate the region which encodes the VP 3. The amino acid sequence of a mixture of cyanogen bromide cleavage fragments generated from purified VP 1 protein covered in copending USSN 541,836, supra has been compared to the translation of the DNA sequence to more precisely locate the region which encodes the VP 1 protein. Referring to Fig. 1, the restriction map for the HAV genome indicates the location of the following 4 restriction sites the Hinc II cleavage site at base 1643 of the DNA sequence the Hind III cleavage site at base 1744 the Bam HI cleavage site at base 2049 and the Pvu II cleavage site at base 2722. These genome map positions are in the 5 to 3 direction on the genome The nucleotide sequence of the region encoding the structural proteins, together with the reading frame for the protein is as follows Within this entire sequence is encoded the information necessary to make the antigenic proteins of HAV. The sequences encoding for the structural proteins begin at base 403. The VP 3 protein is encoded starting approximately at map position 1149. The VP I protein is encoded starting approximately at map position 1882. The key sub unit sequences within VP 1, designated Sequences I, II, III, IV, and V, start, respectively at 1882, 1963, 1999, 2146, 2347. An effective vaccine can contain any one or more of these subunits, or of any other effective peptide subunit encoded within the genome sequence. The value of the nucleotide sequence will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art a particular nucleotide sequence encoding for an active peptide or peptide fragment can be synthesized and cloned into an expression system in order to produce the particular peptide or subunit desired. These nucleotide sequences can be either made by total synthesis, that is, by linking bases according to known techniques, or by direct isolation from the viral RNA or cDNA. If the start of the nucleotide sequence desired does not correspond to the particular peptide, known techniques which enzymatically add or subtract the particular bases to the nucleotide chain can be employed to precisely make the nucleotide sequence. Other nucleotide sequences which are valuable as encoding antigenic proteins are the sequences from base 1749 to base 2722 from base 1487 to base 2980 and from base 1644 to base 2722, all contained within the above sequence. The sequence from base 1749 to base 2722 is especially valuable as a vector for producing antigen protein, see the following examples. In order to begin studies on expression, a DNA clone containing the region of sequences encoding VP 3 and VP 1 in a single insert was first constructed. The DNA of clone 28 94 was cleaved with EcoRI and Xba I restriction enzymes and the 5.76 kb band of DNA containing the 5 portion of the viral structural protein genes was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and electroelution. Similarly, the 2.3 kb EcoRI XbaI band containing the 3 portion of the viral structural genes of clone 28 77 was purified. These two fragments were ligated together to re form pBR322 vector molecules containing the entire non rearranged viral structural gene sequences. The ligated mixture was transformed into The expression of HAV specified proteins containing antigenic reactivity to anti HAV antibodies can be accomplished in bacterial cells, yeast, or higher eucaryotic cells. Some of the possible methods to obtain expression of the cDNA clones into proteins or polypeptide products are described below. In the first example, fragments of HAV cDNA are inserted downstream from the bacterial lac promoter making a fusion product with the N terminal amino acids of the bacterial β galactosidase followed by HAV polypeptides. The fragments of HAV cDNA used having ends generated by Bgl II or Bam H1 or Hind III or Pst I or Taq I or Sau 3A or Nco I are ligated into the appropriate sites of the known expression plasmids pUC 7, 8, or 9 or pCQV2. The expression plasmid used with each HAV DNA fragment is selected to give an open reading frame for translation after insertion of the DNA. The recombinant expression plasmids are transformed into Alternatively, the fragments of HAV cDNA are inserted downstream of the Herpes simplex viral thymidine kinase gene promoter in a plasmid, cloned in The cells expressing HAV proteins or polypeptides are labeled by growth in the presence of ³⁵S labeled methionine or ¹⁴C labeled leucine. Extracts of the cells are then prepared and reacted with anti HAV antiserum or anti HAV monoclonal antibodies. The antigen antibody complexes are collected by precipitation with formalin fixed Staph A, dissociated by boiling in SDS EDTA, and separated by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins are then visualized by autoradiography. Alternatively, the expressed HAV proteins or polypeptides are detected by a competition radioimmune assay. Purified HAV virion particles are labeled Both of these constructions allow read through from the initiating AUG codon within pCQV2 and continues beyond the end of the insert into the pCQV2 sequences for 50 amino acids before a termination codon is encountered. The predicted open reading frame of pHAV 6 is therefore 275 amino acid residues and that of pHAV57 11 is 464 amino acid residues. Plasmid HAV57 11 contains the following nucleic acid sequences Plasmid HAV 6 contains the nucleic acid sequences identified by numbers 5 and 6 above, but not those sequences identified by numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4. Expression plasmids pHAV 6 and pHAV57 11 were grown in L broth to log phase and induced by heat shock at 42 C. The pCQV2 expression vector carries a temperature sensitive λ repressor which suppresses synthesis of proteins inserted at the λ rightward promoter λP The antisera were in turn detected by I¹²⁵ labelled protein A. Two criteria were used to determine expression of HAV specified proteins 1 Heat inducibility, and 2 Appearance of a novel band absent in the original vector pCQV2 when probed with post immune serum. Plasmid HAV 6 showed a unique band at 30 and 20 k daltons when probed with DB 2 serum and a band at 30 kd when probed with C149 post immune serum. Since pHAV 6 contains an insert entirely within VP 1 coding region, expression of VP 1 segments in Plasmid HAV57 11 showed six prominent bands when probed with DB 2 serum. They are, in order of decreasing size, 50, 35, 23, 20, 16, and 14 k daltons. Presumably, the smaller peptides represent degradation products of the 50 kd protein. The profile is simpler when the probe used was C149. The 50 kd band was clearly visible as well as two weak bands around 30 k daltons. The small molecular weight protein bands were presumably degradation products. Since pHAV57 11 contains a DNA insert which encodes 133 amino acids of VP 3 representing the C terminus as well as most of VP 1 sequences excluding 30 amino acids from the C terminal end expression of VP 1 segments and VP 3 segments in Pre and postimmune serum from a marmoset injected with native virus were used to screen the protein blots. Preimmune serum failed to bind to any novel induced protein in both pHAV 6 and pHAV57 11. Postimmune serum on the other hand reacted with a protein 50 kd in size produced in induced pHAV57 11 cells and another 18k daltons in size. The detection of 50 kd protein in pHAV57 11 suggests that at least some of the same determinants or epitopes seen on the native virus are also available for interaction with antibody in the 50 kd protein. The presence of 133 amino acid residues of VP 3 sequences at the N terminus of VP 1 presumably allows the VP 1 protein to assume a tertiary structure which exposes at least some of the determinants normally exposed on native virus. Hence the 50 kd protein and possibly the 18 kd protein made in
