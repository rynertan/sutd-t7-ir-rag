# REVERSE OSMOSIS MEMBRANES AND PROCESS FOR THEIR PREPARATION

## Abstract
An aromatic polyamide reverse osmosis membrane having a density of 0.15 0.30 g cc with a salt rejection of 95 or more and exhibiting improved flux is disclosed. The membrane is prepared by casting a solution of an aromatic polyamide, partially drying the thereby formed pre membrane to a polymer content of 30 to 50 by weight followed by quenching the pre membrane with water within 5 10 seconds of leaving the drying step. Optionally, the membrane can be annealed in hot water.
