# A reprocessable thermoplastic graft copolymer of propylene polymer and ethylene copolymer, a process for producing the copolymer, electrical wire or cable when insulated by the copolymer, and reprocessable molded articles when formed from the copolymer.

## Abstract
Graft copolymers are prepared by heating the propylene polymer and ethylene copolymer in the presence of select peroxides in order to graft the propylene polymer onto the ethylene copolymer These graft copolymers can be used as electrical wire or cable insulation compositions or for forming reprocessable molded articles.
