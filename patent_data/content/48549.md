# 3 0 Demethyl derivatives of istamycin B series compounds and their preparation.

## Abstract
New derivatives of istamycin B series compounds are provided, which are 3 O demethylistamycin B₀, 3 O demethylistamycin B and 3 O demethyl 2 N formimidoylistamycin B represented generally by formula I or specifically by formulae Ia, Ib and Ic, respectively. Compound Ia is useful as an intermediate for the preparation of Compounds Ib and Ic and the latter two compounds exhibit a high anti bacterial activity against a wide variety of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria and are useful antibiotics. Also provided are processes for the preparation of the new derivatives starting from istamycin B₀.
