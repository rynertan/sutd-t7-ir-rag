A part 3 of the filaments of the sheath yarn wrap around the core yarn with successive alternate twists while another part 2 of the filaments are substantially cohered and partially adhered to the core yarn 1 . The composite yarn is made by simultaneous draw false twisting and heating two component yarns having different fusing temperatures, one of the component yarns being overfed in relation to the other component yarn.
