# Electromagnetic deflection unit.

## Abstract
An electromagnetic deflection unit 1 for a cathode ray tube, comprising a hollow support adapted to surround a part of the cathode ray tube, the inside of the support carrying at least one deflection coil which is wound directly thereon, the support having at each end a slotted annular member 4,5 , segments of the coil turns extending from the slots in one annular member to the slots in the other annular member. Between its ends the support has means which locally support the segments of the coil turns in such manner that they are further free from engagement with the inner surface of the support. The supporting means preferably comprise a central ring 6 provided concentrically in the support and having slots 7 in the inner circumference through which the segments of the coil turns extend and which are provided on the inner circumference of the central ring in such manner that they also extend in the direction of the wire supplied during the winding process.
