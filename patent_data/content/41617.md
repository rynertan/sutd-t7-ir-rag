## Description
Crosslinked Polyolefin CompositionsStabilized With Thiodialkanoate PolyestersBackground of the InventionThis invention relates to antioxidant systems suitable for use in polyolefin compositions which are crosslinkable either by irradiation or by chemical means. Particularly these antioxidant systems are effective while exhibiting greater crosslinking efficiency of the polyolefin compositions then previously known antioxidant systems.Polyolefins are easily degraded by oxidation especially at elevated temperatures. It is well known that hindered phenols are effective antioxidants in polyolefins. Aromatic amines are also well known antioxidants although their tendency to dis color light colored products limits their usefulness. As is disclosed in US A 2,519,755, thiodipropionates are also satisfactory antioxidants for poly ethylene. US A 3,344,113 discloses a stabilizer for polypropylene comprising thiodipropionic acid esters of a mixture of lauryl and stearyl alcohols. US A 3,501,520 discloses todicarboxylic acid thioether esters blended with alkylene phenols and phenolic sulfides as antioxidants for poly alpha olefins. US A 3,523,083 discloses a synergistic mixture of a butylated, styrenated cresol and certain esters of thiodipropionic acid as effective stabilizers for mineral oils.Crosslinked polyolefin compositions are often used at elevated temperatures where uncross linked polyolefin compositions would melt or deform. Such crosslinked polyolefin compositions must be formulated with sufficient levels of antioxidants to withstand oxidation at temperatures above those to which uncross linked polyolefin compositions might normally be exposed. Furthermore, during irradiation or chemical crosslinking much of the antioxidant is consumed so that it no longer functions as an antioxidant. This creates a two fold problem. The consumption of the antioxidant 1 reduces the crosslinking efficiency of either irradiation or chemical crosslinking and 2 leaves the crosslinked polyolefin composition vulnerable to oxidation. Increasing the quantity of antioxidant, or the amount of irradiation of chemical crosslinking agents, does not overcome this problem.Thiodialkanoic esters such as dilauryl thiodipropionate and distearyl thiodipropionate which are so commonly used with hindered phenols as antioxidants in polyolefin compositions are particularly adversely affected by both irradiation and chemical crosslinking agents, producing compositions with either low levels of crosslinking, poor oxidation resistance, or both. It has been found that polyesters of thiodialkanoic acids when formulated into polyolefin compositions in combination with other antioxidants such as hindered phenols and aromatic amines do not interfere appreciably with crosslinking by either irradiation of chemical means and still impart satisfactory oxidation resistance. Thiodialkanoic polyesters referred to in this invention are those disclosed in US A 3,157,517, 3,378,516, 3,466,323 and 3,590,056 granted to C.T. Tholstrup et al and assigned to Eastman Kodak Company. While the use of thiodialkanoic polyesters as antioxidants in polyolefins is known, hitherto it was not known that they have the unexpected property of not interfering in crosslinking reactions generated by irradiation or chemical means while still retaining their antioxidant properties.Reinforcing fillers such as carbon black and fumed silica can be used in polyolefin compositions. Reinforcing fillers when used in crosslinked polyolefin compositions produce compositions which have unusually high physical properties particularly at elevated temperatures. Unfortunately, reinforcing fillers tend to impair the oxidation resistance of these compositions. It has been found that compositions containing reinforcing fillers and thiodialkanoate polyesters are not only more easily crosslinked by irradiation or chemical means but especially those compositions containing fumed silica have better oxidation resistance compared to compositions containing the commonly used thiodialkanoate esters.It is an object of this invention to provide a crosslinked polyolefin composition containing an antioxidant system which is more easily crosslinkable than previouslyknown composition. It is an object of this invention to provide a crosslinked polyolefin composition containing an antioxidant system which has comparable or better oxidation resistance than previously known compositions.It is a further object of this invention to provide a crosslinked polyolefin composition containing a reinforcing filler and an antioxidant system which is more easily crosslinkable than previously known compositions.It is still a further object of this invention to provide a crosslinked polyolefin composition containing a reinforcing filler and an antioxidant system which has comparable or better oxidation resistance than previously known compositions.Summary of the InventionIn an antioxidant system for crosslinked polyolefin compositions consisting of a first antioxidant such as a phenolic or amine antioxidant and a second antioxidant containing a thiodialkanoate portion, the use of a thiodialkanoate polyester antioxidant which interferes less with crosslinking than the commonly used thiodialkanoate ester antioxidants while producing comparable or improved antioxidant protection. Suitable thiodialkanoate polyesters have the formula A T D n T A where A is an alcohol portion, T is a thiodialkanoate portion, D is a diol portion and n is an integer.Preferred Embodiment of the InventionThis invention provides an antioxidant system for crosslinked polyolefin compositions which interferes less with cross .inking than commonly used antioxidant systems while providing comparable or improved antioxidant protection. This invention is based on the discovery that thiodialkanoate polyester antioxidants interfere less with the irradiation or chemical crosslinking of polyolefin compositions than commonly used thiodialkanoate ester antioxidants while providing comparable or improved antioxidant protection. The preferred thiodialkanoate polyesters provided by this invention are disclosed inU.S. Patents 3,157,517, 3,378,516, 3,466,323 and 3,590,056 granted to C.T. Tholstrup et al and assigned to Eastman Kodak Company.They have an average molecular weight of from about 500 to about 4000 and have the formula A T D n T A where A is an alcohol portion, T is a thiodialkanoate portion, D is a diol portion and n is an integer. Examples of alcohols which can be used are methanol,ethanol,butanol, isobutanol,2 ethylhexanol, 2,2 dimethylpentanol, 2,2,4trimethylpentanol, stearyl alcohol, etc. Examples of thioalkanoic acids which can be used are 3,3 thiodipropionic acid 4,4 thiodibutyric acid thiodipinalic acid etc. Examples of diols which can be used are neo pentyl glycol 2 ,3 diethylpropanediol 1 ,3 2 ethyl 2butylpropanediol 1,3 2 ethyl 2 propylpropanediol 1,3 2 ethyl 2 methylpropanediol 1,3 1 , 1 cyclohexane dimetha nol 1,2 cyclohexanedimethanol, 1,3 cyclohexanedimethanol 1,4 cycohexanedimethanol 2,2,4,4, tetramethyl 1,3 cyclo butanediol etc.Methods for making polyesters of this type are well known.For example, n l moles of thiodialkanoic acid can be reacted with n moles of glycol where n is an integer greater than 1 using any of the ester interchange catalysts known to the art. To produce relatively low molecular weight polyester an appropriate chain terminating agent such as a monohydric alcohol can be used.The crosslinkable polyolefins protected by the antioxidant system of this invention are homopolymers or copolymers of mono 1 olefins having from 2 to 8 carbons and their mixtures. Polymers of ethylene, propylene, butene 1, hexene 1, octene 1, and the like as well as copolymers of two mono 1 olefins such as ethylene and propylene, ethylene and butene 1, and the like, can be used. Other polymers that can be stabilized according to this invention include copolymers of mono 1 olefins copolymerized with monomers such as vinyl acetate, vinyl chloride, methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, methyl acrylate, acrylic acid, styrene acrylonitrile, acrolein and the like. Specific copolymers include ethylene propylene copolymer, ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer, ethylene ethyl acrylate, as well as mixtures of such copolymers with olefin polymers.Crosslinkable polyolefins which exhibit improved oxidatipn resistance when compounded with thiodipropionate esters or with blends of thiodipropionate esters and other antioxidants can be used with the antioxidant system of this invention.The thiodialkanoate polyesters of this invention can be used in combination with all the antioxidants with which thiodialkanoate esters can be used. The patent literature discloses many combinations including the following US A 3,072,603, with phenyl substituted amines, US A 3,190,852, with polyphenols,US A 3,227,767, with phenols,US A 3,255,136, with phenyl phosphites,US A 3,357,946, with trihydroxyaryl hydrocarbons, US A 3,409,587, with organic phosphites,US A 3,445,424, with benzophenones and phenolics,US A 3,451,932, with phosphothionates, US A 3,454,523, with phenolics and phenyl salicylates.The crosslinked polyolefin compositions of this invention can be provided both by chemical or irradiation means.Suitable chemical crosslinking agents are organic peroxides such as dicumyl peroxide di tert butyl peroxide, 2,5 bis tert amylperoxy 2 ,5 dimethyl hexane 2,5 bis tert butylperoxy 2,5 dimethylhexane 2, 7 dimethyl, 7 di tert butylperoxy octadiyne 3,5 2,5 dimethyl 2,5 di peroxybenzoate hexyne 3 2,5 dimethyl 2,5 di tertbutylperoxy hexyne 3 etc.The crosslinking of polyolefin compositions by irradiation means is discussed in many publications including, Atomic Radiation and Polymers by A. Charlesby, PergamonPress, London 1960 and An Introduction to RadiationChemistry by J.W. T. Spinks and R.J. Woods, John Wiley Sons 1964 . Irradiation of polyolefins is desclosed in US A 2,855,517, 2,877,500, 2,878,174, 2,904,480, 2,960,453, 2,981,668, . 3,022,543, 2,94 5,792, 21948,666, 2,906,679.The polyolefin compositions of this invention can be made more susceptible to crosslinking by either chemical or irradiation means by the addition of sensitizers or crosslinking promoters such as, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, diethylene glycol dimethacrylate, trimethylol propane trimethacrylate, pentaerythritol tetramethacrylate, trimethylol propane triacrylate, triallyl trimellitate, triallyl cyanurate, triallyl isocyanurate, triallyl citrate, pentaerythritol triacrylate. The reinforcing fillers which can be used with this invention are those disclosed in US A 3,084,114 granted to Gilbert and Precopio and assigned to General ElectricCompany. They include inorganic and carbon aceous fillers such as silica xerogels, silica aerogels, pyrogenic silicas, hydrophobic silicas, metal silicates, titanium dioxide, zinc oxides, metal carbonates, boron compounds, such as boron oxides and carbides, carbon blacks, etc.The crosslinked polyolefin compositions can also contain other compounding ingredients such as flame retardants, colorants, extenders, etc.The invention will be more fully understood upon referring to the following examples.Examples 1 to 9The compositions in grams listed in Table I were mixed on a heated 2 roll mill until homogeneous.Plaques measuring 152.4 x 152.4 mm 6 by 6 inches and 1.524 mm 60 mils thick were pressed at 1490C 3000F at 1.96 kN 20 tons . Plaques were irradiated on a 3.0 million volt, 400 microampere Van de Graaff electron accelerator. The irradiation dosage for each plaque in megarads is reported in Table I.To determine the comparative degree of crosslinking, the physical properties of the formulations were tested at 1500C on an Instron Model 1122 Universal TensileTesting Instrument equipped with a temperature cabinet.In practice, the 100 modulus of a composition determined at a temperature above the crystalline melt temperature of the polymer is an excellent indication of its degree of crosslinking. Specimens were pulled at 50.8 mm 2 inches per minute at an initial jaw separation of 25.4 mm 1 inch . The modulus at 100 jaw separation was used to indicate 100 modulus. Jaw separation at break was used to indicate elongation at break. Because of the height limitation of the temperature cabinet, the maximum measurable elongation was 620 percent.Specimens were heat aged for 7 days at 121 C in an air circulating oven. The specimens were allowed to come to room temperature overnight and then tested for percent elongation at room temperature. Tests were determined on an Instron Model 1122 UniversalTensile Testing Instrument at a pull speed of 508 mm 20 inches per minute using a 50.8 mm 2 inch jaw separation and 25.4 mm 1 inch bench marks. The percent elongation at break of a specimen after heat ageing is considered an excellent indication of its resistance to heat ageing.DFD 6005, produces by Union Carbide Corporation, is a low density polyethylene with a density of 0.92 grams per cubic centimeter and a melt index of 0.20 grams per 10 minutes. Irganox 1010, produced by Ciba GeigyCorp., is a phenolic antioxidant, tetrakis methylene 3 3 ,5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxy phenyl propionate methane. Flectol H, produced by Monsanto, is an amine antioxidant, polymerized 1,2 dihydro 2,2,4 trimethyl quinoline. Weston 618, produced by Borg Warner Chemicals, is a phosphite antioxidant, distearyl pentaerythritol diphosiphite. Dilauryl thiodipropionate is a thiodipropionate ester produced by a number of companies including American Cyanamid Company and WitcoChemical Company. Poly TDP 2000, is a thiodipropionate polyester. It is a reaction product of 3,3 thiodipropionic acid and 1,4 cyclohexyl dimethanol partially terminated with stearyl alcohol with an average mole cular weight of about 2000 produced by Eastman Chemical Products, Inc.In Examples 1, 2 and 3 in Table I the polyethylene protected with thiodipropionate polyester and irradiated at 10 megarads is equal in hot physical properties to similarly irradiated polyethylene containing no antioxidant. Polyethylene protected with dilauryl thiodipropionate when irradiated at 20 megarads still does not have the hot physical properties of an unprotected polyethylene irradiated at half the dosage.This clearly shows the adverse effect of the thiodipropionate ester on the irradiation sensitivity of a polyolefin polymer while the thiodipropionate polyester shows no adverse effect. Further, the heatageing resistance of the formulations c ontaining the thiodipropionate ester and polyester are comparable.The unprotected polyethylene as would be expected showed poor heatageing resistance.In examples 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 in Table I, polyethylene is protected with thiodiproprionates and in combination with phenolic, amine and phosphorous containing antioxidants. In each case, the polyethylene protected by the antioxidant system containing the thiodipropionate ester shows an adverse effect on irradiation sensitivity while the polyethylene protected by the antioxidant system containing the thiodipropionate polyester has little or no adverse effect on irradiation sensitivity. Further, the heat ageing resistance of the formulations containing the thiodipropionate ester and polyester are comparable.

This shows that the thiodipropionate polyester did not interfere with irradiation crosslinking as much as the thiodipropionate ester. Also, the elongationg at break of samples heat aged for 7 days at 1750C was comparable for formulations containing the thiodipropionate polyester and the thiodipropionate ester. This shows that formulations containing these antioxidants were comparable le in heat ageing or oxidation resistance.

As is well known in the art, polyolefins can be cross linked by chemical means as well. A common chemical cross linking agent for polyolefins and other polymers is dicumyl peroxide.The compositions in grams listed in Table VI containing dicumyl peroxide were mixed until homogeneous on a heated 2 roll mill whose temperature was kept below 1270C t260 F . Plaques measuring 152.4 x 152.4 mm 6 by 6 inches and 1.524 mm 60 mils thick were press cured for 15 minutes at 1770C 3500F . These formulations were tested using the same procedure described forExamples 10 to 13.The test results listed in Table VI show that the formulations containing the thiodipropionate polyester, PolyTDP 2000 produced higher 100 moduli at 1500C when chemically crosslinked than formulations containing the thiodipropionate ester, dilauryl thiodipropionate. This shows that the thiodipropionate polyester did not interfere with chemical cross linking as much as the thiodipropionate ester. Also, the elongation at break of samples heat aged for 7 days at 1750C was comparable for formulations containg the thiodipropionate polyester and the thiodipropionate ester. This shows that formulations containing these antioxidants were comparable in heat ageing or oxidation resistance.

T 1018 and N 1018 are thiopropionate polyesters produced by Evans Chemetics, Inc.These products have the general formula A T D n T A where A is a stearyl alcohol, T is a thiodipropionic acid portion and D is a diol portion and n is integer. In the case of T 1018 the diol is 2,2,4,4 tetra methyl 1,3cyclobutanediol while in the case of N 1018 the diol is neopentyl glycol.The tests results listed in Table VII show that the formulations containing the thiodipropionate polyesters produced comparable or higher 100 moduli at 1500C at lower irradiation dosages than formulations containing the thiodipropionate ester, dilauryl thiodipropionate.This shows that the thiodipropionate polyesters did not interfere with irradiation cross linking as much as the thiodipropionate ester. Also, the elongation at break of samples heat aged for 7 days at 1750C was comparable for formulations containing the thiodipropionate polyesters and the thiodipropionate ester. This shows that formulations containing these antioxidants were comparable in heat ageing or oxidation resistance.
