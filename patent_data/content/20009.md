# Ignition coil with excess pressure releasing arrangement.

## Abstract
An ignition coil, for a spark ignition system, includes a hollow casing 11 closed at one end by a base 12 and closed at its opposite end by an electrically insulating cap 13 carrying at least the high voltage output terminal of the coil, primary and secondary windings within the casing 11 , an annular resilient sealing gasket 17 trapped between mutually presented faces of the casing 11 and the cap 13 to seal the interface of the casing 11 and the cap 13 , and, the casing having adjacent said gasekt 17 , at least one localised region 22 so shaped as to provide a weak point in the seal effected by the gasket 17 between the casing and the cap, whereby when the pressure within the casing exceeds a predetermined value the sealing action at said weak point fails so relieving the excess pressure in the casing.
