# Image forming apparatus.

## Abstract
An image forming apparatus is provided with a light emitting element 92 for indicating a specific range of an original disposed on an original table 2 , and the other light emitting elements 101 for erasing the electric charge on the surface of a photosensitive body 10 in response to the spe cific range of the original indicated by the light emitting ele ment 92 . A spot light is applied to the original on the original table by the light emitting element, and moved to specify the perimeter of an erasure range. In image forming, the specific range inside the perimeter is defined by an erasure range designating key 30f and is developed through the black toner by a developing device 12₁ . On the other side, the specific range outside the perimeter is defined by the other erasure range designating key 30g and is developed through the red toner by the other developing device 12₂ .
