One of the known physiological effects of histamine is the stimulation of gastric acid secretion. It has been reported that a specific histamine receptor, the H2 histamine receptor, mediates the stimulatory action of histamine Black et al., Nature, 1972, 236, 385 . Accordingly, an extensive search has been undertaken for agents which block the H2 receptor and thus inhibit gastric acid secretion.

The present invention also includes novel intermediates useful in the preparation of the compounds of Formula I. More particularly, such compounds are those of Formula IIEMI6.1 and the acid addition salts thereof, wherein n is an integer from 1 to 4, R is alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms and R is hydrogen, methyl or ethyl. Further intermediates useful for the preparation of compounds of Formula I are those of Formula IIIEMI6.2 wherein n is an integer from 1 to 4, preferably 2, R is alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms and R is hydrogen, methyl or ethyl. Further intermediates useful for the preparation of compounds of Formula I are those of Formula IVEMI7.1 and the acid addition salts thereof wherein R2 is hydrogen, alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms or hydroxyalkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms and X is halo, preferably chloro. The novel compounds of Formula I wherein Y is hydrogen, alkyl or hydroxyalkyl may be prepared by the reaction seguence shown in Scheme I. The numbering of the two heterocyclic rings in Scheme I is that employed throughout the specification. Scheme IEMI8.1 In Scheme I, a 2 haloisonicotinonitrile is treated with an alkali metal alkoxide such as sodium methoxide in an alcohol solvent such as methanol at a temperature between 15 to 350C and then allowed to react with an essentially equimolar amount of an appropriate carboxylic acid hydrazide in a suitable solvent, preferably methanol under reflux for about 20 hours. If necessary, as in the case of the 3 hydroxymethyl derivative, the pH is maintained between 9 10 during reflux by addition of dilute base, e.g. alkali metal hydroxide preferrably sodium hydroxide. It will be understood that in the resulting compound, an intermediate of Formula IV, the substituent at the 3 position is determined by the particular acid hydrazide employed in the synthesis.Thus for example acetic acid hydrazide is employed to produce 31 methyl 51 2 halo 4 pyridyl 11 ,2 ,4 triazole, formic acid hydrazide to produce 3 2 halo 4 pyridyl 1 ,2 ,4t triazole, propionic acid hydrazide to produce 31 ethyl 5 2 halo 4 pyridyl 11 ,2 ,41 triazole and glycolic acid hydrazide to produce 3 hydroxymethyl 5 2 halo 4 pyridyl 11 ,2 ,4 triazole. This halo intermediate of Formula IV is finally converted to an amino derivative of Formula I by heating with an appropriate aqueous alkylamine solution at about 1600C to 1800C for about 20 hours. For example, the preferred compounds of Formula I in which R is ethyl andR is hydrogen may be prepared from the halo intermediate of Formula IV and aqueous ethylamine at about 1600C to 1800C for 16 to 18 hours. In a second reaction sequence, illustrated by SchemeII, compounds of Formula I of the present invention may be prepared from intermediate compounds of FormulaII which may be prepared from compounds of Formula III. Scheme IIEMI10.1 In Scheme II, an alkyl 3 phthalimido alkanimidate salt, preferably ethyl 3 phthalimido propionimidate hydrohalide prepared from 3 phthalimido propionitrile by standard procedures well known in the art, is allowed to react with an equimolar amount of alkali metal alkoxide, preferably sodium ethoxide in an alcohol, preferably ethanol, and is then combined with a 2 alkylamino isonicotinic acid hydrazide, preferably 2 ethylamino isonicotinic acid hydrazide. Reaction is continued under reflux, for example, for 16 hours to 48 hours to produce 3 phthalimidoalkyl 51 2 alkyl substituted 4 pyridyl 1 ,2 ,4 triazole, an intermediate compound of Formula III. This intermediate may be subsequently converted to the intermediate of Formula II by an excess molar amount of hydrazine hydrate in a polar reaction inert solvent such as an alkyl alcohol, preferably ethanol, and heated at about 750 to 100 C for about 2 hours. The product, a 3 aminoalkyl 5 2 alkylamino 4 pyridyl 1 ,2 ,4l triazole, is recovered as the addition salt by crystallization from mineral acid. An alternative preparation for compounds ofFormula II again utilizing as starting reagent a 2 halo isonicotinonitrile, is given in Scheme III. Scheme IIIEMI12.1 In Scheme III, a 2 haloisonicotinonitrile, preferably the chloro derivative, is combined with a less than equimolar amount of an alkali metal lower alkoxide, preferably sodium methoxide or sodium ethoxide in an alkyl alcohol.The solution is stirred for about 2 hours at about 150C to 300C, an equimolar amount of hydantoic acid hydrazide is added and the solution is heated at reflux for up to several days, when the resultant N 2 halo isonicotinimidoyl N ureidomethyl carbonyl hydrazine hydrate is formed. It is then combined with an aqueous alkylamine and heated under pressure at about 150 to 1900C for up to several days to produce 3 aminomethyl 5 2 alkylamino 4 pyridyl l1 ,2 ,4 , triazole hydrochloride, an intermebiate compound of Formula II. The novel compounds of Formula I wherein Y is an amide of the structureEMI13.1 may be prepared from intermediate amino compounds ofFormula II by three alternative methods. In a firsttmethod, wherein Q is alkyl, phenyl, mono halo substituted phenyl, or alkyl substituted with methoxy, phenoxy or phenyl, may be prepared by combining an appropriate intermediate of Formula II with an excess molar amount of a trialkylamine and an essentially equimolar amount of carboxylic acid halide, preferably an acid chloride, of the formula QC O C1 in a suitable reaction inert solvent such as pyridine. The reaction solution is stirred at room temperature until reaction is complete, up to several days. Thus, for example, the preferred compounds wherein n is 2, R is ethyl, R1 is hydrogen and Q is methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, methoxy methyl, phenoxy methyl, phenyl, chlorophenyl or phenylethyl may be prepared by combining 3 2 aminoethyl 5 2 ethylamino 4 pyridyl 1 ,2 ,4 ariazole bis hydrochloride in dry pyridine with an essentially equimolar amount of triethylamine followed by an essentially eguimolar amount of the corresponding carboxylic acid chloride of formulaQC O C1. A second method for preparation of the novel amido derivatives of the present invention comprises combining l,l carbonyl diimidazole in a reaction inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or acetonitrile with a carboxylic acid of the structure QCOOH. After heating at reflux, an equimolar amount of an appropriate 3 2 aminoalkyl 5 2 alkylamino 4 pyridyl l1,2 ,4 triazole, Formula II, is added and reflux is continued until reaction is complete, for example from one to 20 hours.Preferred compounds which may be prepared by this method include those in whichR is ethyl, R is hydrogen, n is 2 and Q is pyridyloxymethyl, pyridylmethyl, methoynicotinyl, hydrotynicotinyl, pyridinyl, methoxyphenyl, ethylaminoisonicotinyl, dimethylaminomethylfuryl, guanidino 4 thiazolyl, 3 pyridylethyl, 4 pyridylethyl, 4 pyridylmethyl, 4 imidazolylpropionyl, 4 imidazolyl ethyl, 4 pyridyl ethenyl and guanidinothiazolyl. A third preparative method for novel amido derivatives of the present invention comprises combining a carboxylic acid QCOOH in a suitable solvent such as methylene chloride at about 100C to 100C with an essentially equimolar amount of a trialkylamine and an essentially equimolar amount of an alkyl chloroformate and, after stirring for about onehalf hour near 0 C adding an essentially equimolar amount of an appropriate 3 aminoalkyl 5 2 alkylamino 4 pyridyl 1 ,2 ,4 triazolee, Formula II. The solution is stirred at 150 to 350C for about 12 to 48 hours. For example, preferred compounds of the present invention which may be prepared by this method include those in which R is ethyl, R is hydrogen, n is 2 andQ is 4 pyridyl or 3 pyridyl. Compounds of Formula I of the present invention wherein Y is an alkyl urea derivative of the structureEMI16.1 wherein n is an integer from 1 to 4, and R3 is hydrogen or alkyl may be prepared from an intermediate compound of Formula II and an appropriate isocyanate. For example, the preferred compounds echylamino 4 pyridyl 1,2 ,4 triazol ethylf methylurea, wherein n is 2, R is ethyl, R is hydrogen and R.3 is hydrogen may be prepared by dissolving a 3 2 aminoethyl 5 2 eShylamino 4 pyridyl 1 ,2 ,4 triazole, of Formula II, in an essentially eguimolar amount of aqueous acid, preferably hydrochloric acid, followed by addition of an essentially equimolar amount of an alkali metal isocyanate preferably potassium or sodium isocyanate.Reaction is continued with stirring near room temperature for about 18 to 48 hours. A second preferred compound, N 2 3 4 2 ethylamino 4 pyridyl 1 ,2 ,4 triazolyl ethyl N methyl urea wherein R3 is methyl may be prepared similarly by heating a 3 2 aminoethyl 5 2 e hylamino 4 pyridyl 1 ,2 ,4 triazole of Formula II and an essentially equimolar amount of aqueous acid, preferably hydrochloric acid, with an excess molar amount of methyl isocyanate at about 900C for about 1 to 4 hours. Compounds of Formula I of the present invention wherein Y is thiourea derivative of the structureEMI17.1 wherein n is an integer from 1 to 4 and R4 is alkyl, may be prepared from intermediate compounds ofFormula II by addition of an excess molar amount of an appropriate alkyl isothiocyanate in a polar solvent such as water followed by heating at reflux for about 12 to 24 hours. For example, a preferred compound N 2 31 51 2 ethylamino 4 pyridyl l1,2 ,41 triazolyl ethyl N methylthiourea may be prepared by combining 31 2 aminoethyl 51 2 ethylamino 4 pyridyl l1 ,2 ,4 triazole hydrochloride and an excess molar amount of methyl isothiocyanate in the presence of a base such as an alkali metal carbonate, preferably potassium carbonate, in water and heating at reflux for about three hours.

Thus, for example, a compound wherein R5 is S methyl may be prepared by this method from an intermediate compound of Formula II and dimethyl cyanodithioimino carbonate. This novel S methyl compound may be further converted to a cyanoguanidino compound of Formula I by treatment with an appropriate aqueous alkylamine at about 700C for about 24 to 90 hours Thus, for example, N cyano N ,N dimethyl N 2 3 5 2 eÃ§hylamino 4 pyridyl 1 ,2 ,4 triazolyl ethyl guanidine, a preferred compound of the present invention, wherein R5 isN,N dimethylamino may be prepared in this manner by treatment of the S meÃ§hyl N cyanoisothiourea derivative with aqueous dimethyl amine.Likewise N cyano N 2 3 5 2 eShylamino 4 pyridyl 1l,2 ,4 criazolyl ethyl Nt methyl guanidine is prepared from the S methyl N cyanoisothiourea and aqueous methyl amine.

For example, preferred compounds wherein n is 2 and R6 is methyl, may be prepared from 3 2 aminoethyl 5 2 e hylamino 4 pyridyl 1 ,2 ,4 triazole and N methyll methylthio 2 nitro ethenamine. The compounds of Formula I of the present invention wherein Y isEMI19.1 wherein Z and Q together form a 4 pyrimidinone group may be prepared by combining an intermediate compound of Formula II with an equimolar amount of 2 methylthio 6 methyl pyrimidin 4 one and heating at about 1000 to 2000C for about two hours until gas evolution ceases.

Pentagastrin Peptavlon Ayerst was used to stimulate acid output by continuous infusion into a superficial leg vein at doses earlier determined to stimulate near maximal acid output from the gastric pouch. Gastric juice was collected at 30 minute intervals following the start of a pentagastrin infusion and measured to the nearest 0.1 ml. Ten collections were taken for each dog during an experiment. Acid concentration was determined by titrating 1 0 ml of gastric juice to pH 7.4 with 0.lN sodium hydroxide using an Autoburette and a glass electrode pH meter Radiometer . Drug or vehicle was given intravenously 90 minutes following the start of the pentagastrin infusion, at a dose of 1 mg kg. Gastric acid antiseÃ§xetory effects were calculated by comparing the lowest acid output after drug administration with the mean acid output immediately before drug. The results obtained are as follows 1. Compounds of Examples 2, 3, 8, 12, 17, 20, 21, 24, 26, 27, 31, 35 and 36 gave greater than 50 inhibition of acid secretion in dogs at doses of 10 mg kg or less. 2. The compounds of Examples 912 and 41 gave greater than 50 inhibition of acid at a dosage of 1 mg kg. Example 46 The histamine H2 antagonist activity of compounds of the present invention was determined by the following procedure Guinea pigs are killed rapidly with a blow to the head, the heart removed and the right atria dissected free. Atria are suspended, isometrically, in a temperature controlled 32 2 tissue bath 10 ml containing oxygenated 95 2 5 C02 Rrebs Henseleit buffer pH 7.4 and are allowed to stabilize approximately one hour during which time the tissue bath is flushed several times. Individual atrial contractions are followed with a force displacement transducer connected to a cardiotachometer and Grass polygraph recorder.After obtaining a dose response curve to histamine, the bath containing each atrium is flushed several times with fresh buffer and the atria re equilibrated to basal rates. Following the return to basal rate, test compounds are added at selected final concentrations and the histamine dose response curve is again determined in the presence of antagonist. Results arg expressed as dose ratios, the ratio of histamine concentrations required to produce one half of maximal stimulation in the presence and absence of antagonist, and the apparent dissociation constant of the H2 receptor antagonist pA2 is determined. The results obtained are as follows 1. Compounds of Examples P2, 3, 6, 28, 29, 31, 32, 34, 39 and 41 gave pA2 values of 6.0 or greater. 2. Compounds of Examples 5, 8, 11, 13 27, 30, 33, 35 38, 40 and 43 gave pA2 values between 5.0 and 6.0.
