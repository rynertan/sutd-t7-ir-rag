# METHOD FOR THE REMOVAL OF H2S AND OR ASH FROM MOLTEN SULFUR

## Abstract
A method for reducing the hydrogen sulfide and hyd rogen polysulfides and or ash forming compounds in molten sulfur is disclosed. The subject invention is directed at the addition of an effective amount of an agent selected from the class consisting of dithionates, dithionites, thiosulfates, bisulfides, bisulfites, and organo phosphorous compounds. Where the agent reduces the concentration of the ash forming compounds in the molten sulfur, at least a portion of the ash forming compound present floats to the surface of the molten sulfur where it may be removed by conventional means.
