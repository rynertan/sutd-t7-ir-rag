# Nucleation of urethane compositions.

## Abstract
Generally, urethane compositions free of phase separation patterns and flow lines are produced. One method includes the utilization of a nucleating compound which is generally added to a urethane prepolymer before any chain extension thereof. Another method includes adding a very small initial incremental amount of a curing agent to the prepolymer with an insoluble product being produced thereby and subsequently adding the remainder of the curing agent.
