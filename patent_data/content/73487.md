# Method for manufacturing three dimensional semiconductor device.

## Abstract
A method for manufacturing a three dimensional semi conductor device which is capable of preventing the stepwise disconnection of an interconnection layer and performing a high integration thereby and which comprises the steps of forming a polycrystalline or amorphous semiconductor layer on an insulating film having an opening at a predetermined po sition of a first element covered on a single crystalline semi conductor substrate having the first element irradiating an en ergy beam to said semiconductor layer to grow a single crystal in a predetermined region in said semiconductor layer using as a seed crystal that part of the semiconductor substrate which contacts with semiconductor layer and forming a second ele ment on the grown single crystalline semiconductor region and forming an interconnection between the first and second elements by using a part of the single crystalline semiconduc tor region from said semiconductor substrate to said second element.
