# Porous ceramic article.

## Abstract
A porous ceramic article comprising a porous ceramic body having a three dimensional network of strands defining interconnected cells is characterized in that at least one compound selected from the group consisting of nitrides, carbides, borides and silicides of metals is dispersed in or deposited on tne strands of the porous ceramic body, and the porous ceramic body has a bulk specific gravity of 0.25 to 0.6 an average pore diameter of 0.3 to 10 mm, a porosity of 75 to 95 , and an air pressure drop of 0.1 to 30 mm in water gauge when air passes through the porous ceramic body over a thickness of 1 cm at a velocity of 1 m sec. The porous ceramic body has improved thermal properties. When needle like crystals are dispersed in the porous ceramic body, creep resistance and strength at high temperature are both improved.
