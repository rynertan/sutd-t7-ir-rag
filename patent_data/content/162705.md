## Description
This invention relates to an injection of nicardipine hydrochloride having cerebral vascular dilator activity, coronary dilator activity, and anti hypertension activity and to a process of producing the injection. Hitherto, oral administration formulations containing nicardipine hydrochloride have been available, but no satisfactory injection containing nicardipine hydrochloride has been developed. This is because the compound has reduced solubility in known isotonic aqueous injection media thus in the presence of sodium chloride, which is usually used as an isotonizing agent for injections, it is only possible to obtain an aqueous nicardipine hydrochloride solution which is of too low concentration and or of insufficient stability for satisfactory use as an injection. We have now found that when nicardipine hydrochloride is dissolved in water together with 2 to 7 w v of polyhydric alcohol, a stable isotonic aqueous solution of the nicardipine hydrochloride is unexpectedly obtained. According to this invention there is provided an injection of nicardipine hydrochloride containing 2 to 7 w v of polyhydric alcohol and preferably having a pH of 2.5 to 5.5. This invention also provides a process of producing an injection of nicardipine hydrochloride which comprises dissolving in water nicardipine hydrochloride and 2 to 7 w v of polyhydric alcohol based on the total injection, and if necessary adjusting the pH of the solution to 2.5 to 5.5, preferably 2.5 to 5.0. Even when the pH of the solution as initially formed is from 2.5 to 5.0 or 5.5, it may be preferred to adjust the pH to a specific desired value, e.g. 3.0,3.5 or 5.0. As polyhydric alcohols for use in this invention, there are e.g. sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol, propylene glycol, glycerol, inositol. They may be used alone or in admixture of any two or more. The polyhydric alcohol constitutes about 2 to 7, preferably about 5, w v of the whole amount of the injection. If the polyhydric alcohol should give insufficient isotonization when used at about 2 w v , the isotonization of the injection may be controlled by using other isotonizing agent. Also, if the pH of the injection is lower than 2, the stability of nicardipine hydrochloride is reduced, while if the pH is higher than 6, the solubility of nicardipine hydrochloride is reduced. The concentration of nicardipine hydrochloride in the injection of this invention is dependent upon the polyhydric alcohol concentration and the pH. By selecting appropriate conditions, a solubility of about 0.6 w v can be obtained. The injection of this invention can be prepared by dissolving predetermined amounts of nicardipine hydrochloride and polyhydric alcohol in water, e.g. at 50 C to 60 C, adjusting the pH if necessary or desired , preferably to about 3.5, and then adjusting the volume of the solution to a predetermined volume by the addition of water. The pH of the solution can be controlled by mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid or, as the case may be, by base such as sodium hydroxide or sodium hydrogencarbonate. The injection of nicardipine hydrochloride thus obtained can maintain its desired concentration higher than 0.1 w v and can be stably stored for a long time without change in quality. In addition, it is preferred to use light resistant ampoules for the injection. Tests on the solubility if nicardipine hydrochloride and the stability of nicardipine hydrochloride solutions are set out below The injection of Example 1 Sorbitol 5 w v Each sample was stored in a bath maintained at 60 C and sampled after the same definite periods.

The injection of Example 7 Sorbitol 2 w v Each sample was stored in a chamber at 100 C and sampled after the same definite periods. as for test A a above. The remaining percentage of nicardipine hydrochloride in each sampled solution is shown in the following table. The injection of the Comparison example pH 2.0 Each sample was stored in a chamber maintained at 100 C and sampled after the same definite periods. as for test A a above. The remaining percentage of nicardipine hydrochloride in each sampled solution is shown in the following table. Each sample was stored in a chamber at 121 C for 6 hours. The following Examples are intended to illustrate this invention About 2 litres of distilled water was heated to 50 to 60 C and 2.5 g of nicardipine hdyrochloride and 125 g of sorbitol were dissolved therein with stirring. After cooling the solution pH about 4.5 thus obtained to room temperature, the pH thereof was adjusted to 3.5 using 0.1 N hydrochloric acid. Then, the whole volume thereof was adjusted to 2.5 litres by the addition of distilled water and after filtering the solution, 5 ml. aliquots of the solution were filled into respective light resistant brown ampoules.
