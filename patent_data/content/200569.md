# MONOLITHIC INTEGRATED CIRCUIT DEVICE

## Abstract
A monolithic integrated circuit chip having a single on chip control element and a plurality of data processors, all processor concurrently executing identical dataindependent processing steps under the control of the on chip control element. In an alternative embodiment, delay elements are placed in the control lines between the control element and the data processors. In the case of multi channels each carrying a time slot of a time division multiplexed signal, the processor for each channel may begin executions without waiting for arrival of data for the channels corresponding to later time slots. In a second alternative embodiment, a set of small custom control elements augment the single central control affording a limited amount of data dependent pro cessing for each data processor.
