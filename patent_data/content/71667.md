# Device for determining the real or the virtual distance of a source of light from a measuring plane.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a device for determining the real or the virtual distance of a source of light 3 from a measuring plane 20 . Such devices are preferably em ployed in position detectors in which light impinges on the surface of the object to be measured, said light being reflect ed from said surface towards a photodetector. The light emitted by the light source is imaged at different points on said detector, this depending on the position of the surface of the object to be measured. According to the invention, the imaging system 71, 72, 73 and the position sensitive detec tor form a rotationally symmetrical arrangement. This ren ders the function of the device independent of any lateral displacement of the light source, of different degrees of reflexion of scattering produced by the surface of the object to be investigated, and of the shape of the surface of the object to be investigated.
