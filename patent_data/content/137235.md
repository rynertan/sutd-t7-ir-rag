# METHOD OF MANUFACTURING PLASTIC CONTAINERS, AND CONTAINERS MANUFACTURED THEREBY

## Abstract
The method consists of providing a container made of a plastic material of the biorientable type, initially in bottle form 8 , i.e. with the injected and blown portion thereof tapered to a narrower cross section, thereafter a cut is made at a suitable location 12 to provide a container having a virtually constant cross sectional area body 16 , which is then completed with a cover or lid already incorporating an opening means of its own, e.g. of the tear off type.
