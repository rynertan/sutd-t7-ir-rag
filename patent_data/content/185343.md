# Charge transfer device.

## Abstract
A solid state image sensing device has a plurality of first CCDs 14A 14D for transferring a charge along the column direction and a second CCD 16 for transferring the charge supplied from the first CCDs 14A 14D along the row direction. The first and second CCDs 14A 14D, 16 have n type first transfer channels 24A 24D and an n type second transfer channel 26 which are formed on a p type semicon ductor body. The p type semiconductor body has a first region 18 contacting the bottom surface of the first transfer channels 24A 24D and a second region 22 contacting the bottom surface of the second transfer channel 26 . An impurity concentration of the second region is lower than that of the first region.
