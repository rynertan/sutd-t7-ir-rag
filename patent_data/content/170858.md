# Hook for a hook and eye fastener.

## Abstract
A hook for a hook and eye fastener includes a one piece hook body A having at least one pair of prongs 14 , and a retainer B having openings 23 through which the prongs extend, respectively. The hook body includes a lock ing tongue 11 and a base 12 underlying the locking tongue, and an arcuate portion 13 joining the locking tongue and the base, the prongs projecting substantially perpendicularly from the base in a direction away from the locking tongue. The hook body has a plurality of cold press ed elongated recesses 15 defined in an inner surface of the hook body and extending from the base through the arcuate portion to the locking tongue, thereby giving resilience and strength that are large enough to withstand forces tending to permanently deform the hook body at the arcuate portion. The openings in retainer are spaced from one another by a distance which is larger than the distance between the prongs. Each of the prongs has a bent end portion retained on the retainer with a space 24 defined therebetween. With the hook thus constructed, the hook body is tiltable with respect to the retainer, thereby accomodating the thrust applied thereto during, for instance, the ironing of a garment fabric to which the hook is attached.
