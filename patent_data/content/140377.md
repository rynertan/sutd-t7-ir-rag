# Polyamide rubber blended composition.

## Abstract
The present invention describes a polyamide rubber blended composition having improved resistance to ozone, stress whitening and gasoline prepared by mixing together with heating the following components a from 70 to 20 volume percent of a rubber composi tion consisting of i 30 to 70 volume percent of an acrylonitrile butadiene copolymer containing at least 0.7 weight percent of a carboxyl group in the polymer, and ii 70 to 30 volume percent of an epichlorohydrin rubber b 30 to 80 volume percent of a polyamide resin and c at least 0.1 parts by weight of a polyepoxy compound in terms of the weight of the epoxy group per 100 parts by weight of the rubber composition of component a , components a and b blended together after which compo nent c is added and the resulting mixture kneaded with heat to form the polyamide rubber blended composition.
