## Description
The present invention relates to a pulsator device connectable to a pressurized fluid supply line for converting the fluid pressure of the line to a pulsating pressure. The invention is particularly useful for converting the substantially steady state pressure of a water supply line to a pulsating pressure, and is therefore described below with respect to this application. There are many situations where it is desired to convert the pressure of a fluid supply line to a pulsating pressure. For example, pulsating devices are sometimes used in water sprinklers or water sprayers in order to reduce the total water output while still distributing the water over large areas. Pulsating devices are also used for reducing the water output of sprinklers for cooling greenhouses, for lowering the output rate of drippers, and for reducing the tendency of sprinklers or drippers to become clogged by foreign particles. The conventional method of pulsating the supply line is to include a valve which is periodically driven, either by the fluid of the supply line itself or by an external drive, to periodically open and close the valve and thereby to periodically interrupt the flow of the water therethrough. Such arrangements, however, are relatively inefficient, expensive, and or not conveniently adjustable to vary the pulsating frequency or the pulsating periods. US A 3321138 discloses a liquid control system for effecting intermittent discharge of liquid from a conduit, in which the liquid is inletted into a reservoir and is outletted from the reservoir via a diaphragm type control valve. As described, when the pressure within the reservoir reaches a predetermined value, the diaphgram valve opens to discharge a quantity of the liquid from the reservoir. Such a diaphgram type valve is similar to the relief valves widely used in maintaining a chamber at a constant pressure. Thus, such a valve in the system described in US A 3321138 would maintain the pressure within the reservoir substantially constant, the valve opening only when the pressure within the reservoir exceeds the predetermined regulated pressure, and remaining open only for a sufficient time until the excessive pressure in the reservoir drops back to the regulated pressure. An object of the invention is to provide a pulsator device having a number of advantages over those mentioned above as will be described more particularly below. According to the present invention, there is provided a pulsator device connectible to a pressurized liquid supply line for discharging the liquid in the form of pulses, comprising an inlet fitting including a reservoir for the liquid an inlet orifice from said pressurized liquid supply line for inletting the liquid into the reservoir at a continuous relatively low ratio an outlet fitting including an outlet orifice for outletting the liquid from the reservoir at a relatively high rate and a control valve controlling the liquid flow out of said reservoir via said outlet orifice characterized in that said outlet orifice is of larger cross sectional area than said inlet orifice and that said control valve comprises a housing having an inlet communicating with the reservoir an outlet communicating with the outlet fitting a cylinder and a piston, the piston being fixed and the cylinder being freely movable between two limit positions to open and close said valve inlet and a spring biasing said movable member to a closed position with respect to said valve inlet said cylinder having a cross sectional area larger than that of said valve inlet such that the cylinder is normally urged by said spring to a closed position with respect to said valve inlet, automatically opens with a quick action at a predetermined opening pressure in said reservoir and automatically recloses with a quick action at a predetermined closing pressure in said reservoir which closing pressure is lower than said opening pressure. In one described embodiment, the reservoir is a resilient tube defining an expansible contractible chamber. Such an arrangement permits the pulsator to be constructed very inexpensively. In a second described embodiment, the reservoir is a pressurized container enabling a larger quantity of fluid to be accumulated before discharge and in a third described embodiment, the reservoir is a long vertical tube vented to the atmosphere enabling an even larger quantity of fluid to be accumulated before discharge. In all the described embodiments, the inlet orifice is in the form of a fitting having a small orifice applied to the inlet end of the inlet coupling and the outlet orifice is also in the form of a fitting, but having a larger orifice, applied to the outlet end of the valve. With such an arrangement, the pulsating frequency and periods can be conveniently varied by merely changing the volume of the reservoir, e.g., the length of the resilient tube, and by changing the inlet and outlet orifice sizes. Further features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the description below. The invention is herein described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein The pulsator device illustrated in Fig. 1 comprises a valve, generally designated 2, of the same construction as described in EP A 0 167 474 Briefly, valve 2 is normally closed, but when subjected to a relatively high opening pressure, it automatically opens with a snap action, and remains open until the pressure drops substantially below the opening pressure, whereupon it automatically closes also with a snap action. The illustrated pulsator device further includes an inlet fitting 101 connectable between the inlet of valve 2 and the pressurized supply line 104 and an outlet fitting 106 connected to the outlet of the valve. More particularly, valve 2 comprises a cylindrical housing 3 formed at one end with a reduced diameter extension 4 defining a port connectable to the inlet fitting 101. A collar 6 is frictionally received within a sleeve 8 which sleeve is in turn frictionally received within the respective end of housing 3. Sleeve 8 is integrally formed with an annular ring or partition 10 defining, on opposite sides, a first chamber 12 communicating with the inlet extension 4, and a second chamber 14 communicating with the outlet collar 6. As shown particularly in Fig. 3, annular ring 10 includes a diametrically extending web 16 defining two openings 18, 20 serving as an interconnecting passageway connecting the inlet chamber 12 to the outlet chamber 14. Annular ring 10 is further formed with an upstanding stem 22 having a vertical bore 24 communicating at its lower end with a horizontal bore 26 formed through one half of web 16 and extending to the outer face of sleeve 8. The latter face of the sleeve is flattened on one side, as shown at 28 in Fig. 3, to define a venting passageway 30 between it and housing 3. This passageway communicates with the atmosphere via the spaces between a plurality of ribs 32 formed at the end of housing 3 engageable with a flange 33 formed at the lower end of sleeve 8. Stem 22 receives a sleeve 34 formed at its upper end with an annular shoulder 36 carrying a sealing ring 38 on its lower face, i.e. on the side facing the annular ring 10. Annular flange 36, together with its sealing ring 38, constitutes a piston cooperable with a cylinder 40 having its open end received over the sealing ring, and its opposite end closed by an end wall 42 adjacent to the inlet extension 4. A resilient disc 44, of rubber or the like, is interposed between the cylinder end wall 42 and the inlet extension 4. In addition, a coiled spring 46 is interposed between the inner face of cylinder end wall 42 and the face of annular shoulder 36 opposite to that carrying the sealing ring 38. As shown in Fig. 2, the upper surface of annular ring 10, i.e. the surface facing the open end of cylinder 4, is formed with a plurality of circumferentially spaced ribs or abutments 48 engageable with the open end of cylinder 40 so as to continuously maintain communication between the inlet chamber 12 and the outlet chamber 14 via passageways 18 and 20 through the annular ring 10. Inlet fitting 101 includes a resilient tube 102, preferably of elastomeric material, which is applied between the fluid supply line 104 and the inlet end of valve 2. The inlet end of resilient tube 102 includes a rigid tubular connector 107 formed with an orifice 108 of relatively small cross sectional area, i.e., smaller than orifice 110 formed in the outlet fitting 106. The latter is inserted, as by press fitting, within the outlet collar of valve 2. The pulsator illustrated in Figs. 1 3 operates as follows As noted above, annular shoulder 36, together with its sealing ring 38, defines a piston fixed within housing 3, which piston is cooperable with cylinder 40. Cylinder 40 is biased by spring 46 in the direction tending to cause its end wall 42 to press the resilient disc 44 against the inlet opening defined by housing extension 4. The outer diameter of resilient disc 44 is slightly larger than the diameter of the inlet bore defined by extension 4, but is slightly smaller than the outer diameter of cylinder 40. As one example, the inner diameter of the inlet bore may be 4 mm., the outer diameter of disc 44 may be 5 mm., and the outer diameter of cylinder 40 may be 8 mm. Thus, when the valve is connected between the inlet and outlet fittings, the force of spring 46 biases cylinder 40 to close the inlet extension 4, until the inlet pressure reaches a predetermined value sufficient, by the force applied by it to disc 44, to overcome the force of spring 46. The force applied by the inlet pressure to disc 44 is dependent on the cross sectional area of the inlet bore, which in the described example is 4 mm. As soon as the inlet pressure reaches a value such that it, when multiplied by the cross sectional area of the inlet bore 4, overcomes the force of spring 46, this inlet pressure moves disc 44 together with cylinder 40, away from the mouth of the inlet bore 4 and as soon as this occurs, the effective area is immediately increased to that of the cross sectional area of cylinder 44 the latter cylinder having a diameter of 8 mm. in this example , to produce a very quick action opening of the inlet bore 4. During this opening movement of cylinder 40, abutments 48 in annular ring 10 engage the open end of cylinder 40 and keep it spaced from the annular ring, thereby continuously maintaining communication through the spaces between the abutments and through passageways 18 and 20 to the outlet chamber 14 thus, there is a continuous flow of water from inlet extension 4 through the outlet collar 6. The venting of the interior of cylinder 40 to the atmosphere via bores 24 and 26, space 30, and the spaces between ribs 32, permits this displacement of the cylinder when the inlet pressure has risen to the predetermined minimum for opening the valve. Thus, when the valve is in its open position, pressurized water flows from the inlet 4 through the spaces between abutments 48 and the open end of cylinder 40, passageways 18 and 20, and through the outlet 6, to supply pressurized water to the outlet fitting 106. During this open condition of the valve, the inlet pressure is applied to the enlarged cross sectional area of cylinder 40 to maintain the valve in its open condition. However, if the inlet pressure should drop below another predetermined value lower than the opening pressure because the effective surface area has now been enlarged so as to be the total cross sectional area of cylinder 40 , spring 46 will move cylinder 40 and its disc 44 back against the mouth of the inlet bore 4 to close the bore and as soon as this occurs, the effective area is now reduced to that of the inlet bore 4, thereby providing a quick action closing of the inlet bore. When the inlet coupling 102 is connected to the pressurized fluid line 104, valve 2 is normally in its closed condition, as described earlier. Accordingly, as the water flows into resilient tube 102, the latter tube will expand, as shown by the broken lines in Fig. 1, thereby building up the pressure within the tube. When the pressure builds up to the opening pressure of valve 2, the latter will open as described above this produces a fast discharge of the fluid within tube 102 through the valve and out through the outlet fitting 106. Since the inlet orifice 108 of the inlet fitting 107 is of smaller cross sectional area than the outlet orifice 110 of the outlet fitting 106, the flow of the water out of tube 102 will be faster than into the tube therefore, the pressure applied by tube 102 to the inlet to valve 2 will drop. When it drops to the valve closing pressure, which is lower than the valve opening pressure as described above, the valve will automatically close with a snap action. Resilient tube 102 will then again start to expand, building up the pressure applied to valve 2, until the latter valve again opens to output another pulse of fluid via the outlet orifice 106. As mentioned earlier, resilient tube 102 determines the volume of the expansible chamber reservoir, and therefore this tube may be substituted by one having a smaller or larger length or diameter, depending on the desired volume of this reservoir. It will be appreciated that by the appropriate selection of the diameter and length of the resilient tube 102, and of the sizes of orifices 108 and 110 in fittings 106 and 107, respectively, a wide range of pulsating frequencies and periods may be conveniently provided. Figs. 4 and 5 illustrate two variations which may be used in order to increase the duration of each pulsating period. Thus, Fig. 4 illustrates an arrangement wherein the reservoir is in the form of a pressurized container 200 between the inlet of valve 202 and the inlet connector 207 containing the inlet orifice 208. The water enters and leaves through the bottom of the container, the top of the container being closed. Container 200 may be provided in addition to or in lieu of, resilient tube 210. Fig. 5 illustrates a variation wherein the reservoir is in the form of a long vertical tube 300 between the valve 302 and the inlet connector 307 having the inlet orifice 308. Tube 360 is of a height to produce a pressure head greater than the inlet pressure so that, even though the upper end of the long vertical tube is vented to the atmosphere, no water is discharged through its upper end.
