## Abstract
The method which allows to enter field dependent record selection criteria into a text processing system comprising a keyboard 10 , a processor 11 , a storage 16 and a display 14 , involves the automatic expansion of the boundaries of the selected field in both the header row and qualifying rows when more space is required to enter, for example, lengthy qualifiers into the field, a number of qualifiers which are ORed together, or different spellings of the same qualifier. The expansion results automatically in accordance with the relationship of the end of data position to the right field boundary marker position to move repeti tively the marker a fixed number of character positions, for example, five, towards the right of the display, and, when additional space is required, to shift repetitively the field name and entered data to the left five character positions.
