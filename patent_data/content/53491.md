# A one component type magnetic developer.

## Abstract
A one component type magnetic developer consists es sentially of developer particles of a composition comprising a binder resin medium and a powdery magnetic material dis persed in the binder resin medium, wherein said powdery mag netic material comprises A a nonpulverizing agglomerate of cubic particles of magnetite having a particle size of 1 to 10 µm as measured by an electron microscope and B magnetite particles having a particle size of 0.2 to 1 µm at an A B weight ratio of from 95 5 to 10 90.
