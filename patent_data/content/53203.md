## Description
Package for precious stones .The present invention relates to a package for precious stones, more especially to a package which is apt to contain one or more precious stones the characteristics of which have been previously established and allows to keep the precious stones in a controlled manner, this package being closed in such a way that only through damaging the packingcase it is possible to get at the precious stone or stones, so that any fraud is excluded.As a matter of fact, the package according to the present invention is designed in such a way that with the precious stone or stones it contains a microfilm showing the data concerning the characteristics of the precious stone or stones which is are packed in it, which, once the quality of a precious stone or of a lot of precious stones has been established, makes it possible to sell them without the intervention of an expert being required, it being obtain that the description of the diamond can remain objective, so that it does not depend on successive expert appraisements and descriptions.The package according to the present invention has the following principal advantages the precious stone or precious stones remains remain constantly visible after packing it is possible to arrange the precious stones in a welldefind manner, whilst keeping them in place the sealing of the package is inviolable it is possible to open the package in a simple way in order to give an expert opinion on the precious stones or remove same it is impossible to close the package again without leaving visible traces.The package according to the invention which has the aforesaid and also other advantages comprises, for that purpose, two parts, that is to say a bottom part and a cover, of which at least the cover is made of a transparent material and at least the bottom part has a cavity for at least one precious stone, whilst, around this cavity, a groove with a plurality of small bridges forming interruptions is provided in one of the aforesaid parts and, after placing at least one diamond, the two aforesaid parts are assembled by ultra sound welding, thermic welding, high frequency welding or gluing.In order to throw more light on the characteristic features of the invention are described hereinafter, as examples without any limitative character, a few preferred embodiments of the invention, reference being made to the attached drawings, in which figure 1 shows a view from above of the package accor ding to the invention figures 2 and 3 show on a larger scale the sections according to the lines II II and III III in figure 1 figure 4 shows on a larger scale the part marked F4 in figure 2 figure 5 is a view similar to that of figure 4, but in which there is provided a paper strip or similar figure 6 is a view similar to that of figure 5, but for an embodiment variant the figures 7 through 10 show views from above of the package according to the invention, but for embodiment variants.Figures 1 through 3 show a package that, according to the present invention, chiefly comprises two parts a bottom part 1 and a cover part 2.The bottom part 1 substantially consists of a small rectangular plate having an appropriate thickness, in which there is provided a cavity 3, whilst the cover 2 is provided with a peripheric edge 4, which ensures a precise closure around the aforesaid bottom part 1, whilst in the aforesaid cover is also provided a cavity 5, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, a groove 6 having at certain locations small bridges 7 forming interruptions, in order to ensure that part 8 of the cover 2, in which has been provided the cavity 5, forms a whole with the cover proper 2. The small bridges 7 have preferably a thickness which is less than the thickness of material of the cover 2.The shapes of the cavities 3 and 5 are always mutually alike, but it goes without saying that they may be chosen arbitrarily, although the cavities 3 and 5 have the shape of a cut precious stone in the present embodiment.It goes without saying that the groove 6 may also have any shape and therefore there is shown as an example in figure 4 an embodiment variant according to which this shape follows the outline of the cavities 3 and 5.The depth of the aforesaid cavities 3 and 5 is of course determined so that it becomes possible to pack therein precious stones of different heights and, for an adaptation, when the precious stones have a height which is smaller than the sum of the depths of the cavities 3 and 5, one arranges in one of those cavities, for instance in the cavity 3, one or more layers 9 which may, for instance, be layers of velvet, this velvet being preferably chosen of black colour, in order so to increase the contrast between the precious stone or stones and the surrounding material.As shown in figures 2 and 3, the precious stones are arranged between the bottom part 1 and cover 2 in such a way that the table of each precious stone is placed against the bottom of the cavity 5 of the cover 2.In order to be able to arrange and hold in position the precious stones in definite configurations, there shall preferably be provided maintaining elements which, in this case, will consist of ribs 10 in the aforesaid cavity 5, these ribs being provided at well determined mutual distances, which may of course vary according to the size of the precious stones to be packed, which is clearly shown when figures 1 and 5 are being compared.It goes without saying that the aforesaid ribs 10 may be shaped otherwise and or have other configurations, as shown schematically, for example, in figures 6 and 7.In order to make the package have a particular aspect, it is also possible, on the one hand, to arrange on the bottom part 1, i.e. between this bottom part and the cover 2, a strip of paper 11, coloured or not coloured, in which there is a cutout the shape of which preferably corresponds to the shape of the cavity 3, the cut out provided in the paper strip or similar provided therefore being located underneath the layer or layers 9. In this way there is ensured that when looking on the package from below, one obtains a uniform aspect or colour. It is also possible to print, inscribe, perforate definite data or make them known in a similar way.One may also cut in the paper a window 12, the purpose of which will be explained thereinafter.Finally, also preferably, there shall be provided on the inside face of the cover 2 and along its entire contour, a narrow rib 13 by means of which there is obtained that a little distance remains free between the bottom part 1 and cover 2. The purpose intended with this narrow rib 13 is to ensure that the weld between the bottom part 1 and cover 2 will follow a regular line, so that one obtains a package with a nice aspect. For, if the parts 2 and 1 were simply placed the one above the other, one should obtain a weld line with an irregular width.In figure 6 is also shown an embodiment according to which the rib 13 is provided on a shoulder 14, in order to make more room for the paper strip 11 and microfilm or similar which possibly may be additionally enclosed. The purpose intended with this shoulder 14 is also to prevent any interference between the paper strip and weld.Between the bottom part 1 and cover 2, and adjacent to the groove 6, there is provided a space which, as schematically indicated in figure 1, may be occupied by a bit of paper or similar 15 which is or is not a copy of an official certificate, for instance a microcopy on which are shown all the characteristics of the precious stone or stones enclosed in the package, and which in the present case is visible, amongst others, through the window 12 of the paper strip 11. After placing the precious stone or stones in the package, in the manner described hereinabove, one closes the so constituted package by ultra sound welding, thermic welding, high frequency welding, gluing or a similar process, in order to obtain that the parts 1 and 2 are assembled together at the contour of the bottom plate 1, in such away as to obtain so to say one solid object, excluding the opening of the package. But, according to the present invention, if it is wanted to remove the precious stone or stones from the package, it is sufficient to cut the various small bridges 7 interruptions of the groove 6 by means of a sharp knife or similar tool, after which one is able to remove the part 8 and get at the precious stone or stones. It is clear that it is impossible to fit part 8 in place again, so that any fraud is excluded.It is also clear that, thanks to the presence of the aforesaid groove 6 and small bridges 7, the part 8 can be removed in such a way that the precious stone or stones remain in place during the opening of the package, that is to say do not get suddenly detached at the moment of opening, so that a loss of stones at the moment of the opening is impossible.It is clear that the present invention is not at all limited to the embodiments described hereinabove as examples and shown in the attached drawings, but that such a package may be made with a plurality of shapes and a plurality of dimensions without going beyond the scope of the present invention.
