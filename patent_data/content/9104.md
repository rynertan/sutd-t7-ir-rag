# Method for increasing the scrap melting capability of bottom blown processes.

## Abstract
In the bottom blown process for the refining of molten steel, additional heat is generated for melting greater amounts of scrap, by injecting at least one secondary stream of an oxygen containing gas to the space above the molten metal bath so as to combust the CO and Hâ‚‚ evolving there from. The excess heat so generated is absorbed both by the bath and the furnace lining, causing overheating and rapid deterioration of the lining. For a given quantum of heat so generated the ability of the molten metal to absorb a greater portion of that heat and thereby maintain the temperature of the furnace lining within the practical limits has been found to depend to a significant extent on the design of the furnace itself. The invention is directed to conducting the refining process in vessels which provide, for a given bath capacity, greater top surface areas than has hereto fore been employed.
