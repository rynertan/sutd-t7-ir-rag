It is believed that the more active form is that of structure IA EMI10.1 in which R1, R2 and R3 are defined as above.Furthermore, in general formulae I and IA, it is thought to be advantageous that R1 denotes the hetero aromatic group and that R2 denotes a hydrogen atom.Examples of individual compounds according to the invention include 5RS 2 methyl Z 6 3 pyridylmethylene penem 3 carboxylic acid 5RS 2 ethylthio 6 3 pyridylmethylene penem 3 carboxylic acid 5RS 6 3 pyridylmethylene penem 3 carboxylic acid 5RS 6 pyrazinylmethylene penem 3 carboxylic acid 5RS 6 4 pyrimidinylmethylene penem 3 carboxylic acid 5RS 6 4 pyridylmethylene penem 3 carboxylic acid 5RS Z 6 6 methoxy 3 pyridyl methylene penem 3 carboxylic acid 5RS E 6 6 methoxy 3 pyridyl methylenepenem 3 carboxylic acid 5RS 6 3 pyridazinyl methylene penem 3 carboxylic acid and 5RS 6 5,6 dimethyl 1,2,4 triazin 3 yl methylene penem 3 carboxylic acid and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and in vivo hydrolysable esters thereof.A compound of the general formula I, or a salt or ester thereof, may be prepared by eliminating the elements of a compound of the general formula II H X II from a penem or penem intermediate of the general part formula III EMI11.1 in whichR1 and R2 are defined as above, andX denotes a hydroxy group or a leaving group, to give a compound of the general part formula IV EMI12.1 in which R1 and R2 are defined as above, and, if the resulting compound of the general formulaIV is a penem intermediate, converting it into a penem of the general formula I or a salt or ester thereof.The compound of the general part formula III may suitably be a compound of the general part formulaIIIA EMI12.2 in which R1, R2 and X are defined as above. More especially it may be a compound of the general formulaIIIB EMI13.1 in whichR1, R2 and X are defined as above,R13 denotes C1,6 alkyl, aryl, ary1 C1 6 alkyl, Cl 6 alkylthio, arylthio, hetero aromatic thio, acyl for example, C16 alkylcarbonyl, especially acetyl , C2 6 alkenyl especially vinyl , or ary1 C2,6 alkenyl, all of which may optionally be substituted, andR14 denotes hydrogen or an N protecting group, orR13 and R14 together denote the remainder of a penem nucleus, which may be substituted and or may optionally carry a protecting group.In the case where R13 and R14 in general formula IIIB together denote the remainder of a penem nucleus, they may suitably together denote the sub formula V EMI13.2 in whichR16 denotes the hydrogen atom or organic group R3 or a group convertible into R3 during the preparation of a penem of the general formula I or salt or ester thereof, andRx denotes hydrogen or a carboxyl blocking group.In that case, the penem or penem intermediate of the general part formula III is of the general formula IIID given below.A carboxyl blocking group Rx also referred to as a carboxyl protecting group is suitably a group that can readily be removed at a later stage of the penem preparation process. Examples of suitable carboxyl blocking derivatives that may form the group C02RX include salt, ester, and anhydride derivatives of the carboxylic acid.The salts may be organic or inorganic and need not be pharmaceutically acceptable. Examples of suitable salt forming groups Rx include inorganic salts, for example alkali metal atoms e.g. lithium and sodium , other metal atoms, tertiary amino groups e.g.tri lower alkylamino, N ethylpiperadino, and dimethylpiperazino groups . A preferred salt forming group Rx is the triethylamino group.An ester forming group Rx is advantageously one that can be removed under conventional conditions. Examples of suitable ester forming groups Rx include benzyl, p methoxybenzyl, 2,4, 6 trimethylbenzyl, 3, 5 di t butyl 4 hydroxy benzyl, benzoylmethyl, p nitrobenzyl, 4 pyridylmethyl, 2,2,2 trichloroethyl, 2,2,2 tribromoethyl, allyl, acetonyl, t butyl, t amyl, diphenylmethyl, triphenylmethyl, adamantyl, 2 benzyloxyphenyl, 4 methylthiophenyl, tetrahydrofur 2 yl, tetrahydropyran 2 yl, pentachlorophenyl, p toluene sulphonylethyl, and methoxymethyl groups, and also silyl, stannyl and phosphorus containing groups, and oxime radicals of formula N CHRo in which RO denotes aryl or heterocyclyl.Furthermore, the ester forming group Rx may be an in vivo hydrolysable ester group including, in particular, those listed above.The free carboxyl group may be regenerated from any of the above esters by usual methods appropriate to the particular Rx group, for example, by acid catalysed, base catalysed or enzymically catalysed hydrolysis, or by hydrogenation. The hydrolysis must of course be carried out under conditions in which the groups on the rest of the molecule are stable.When it is desired to produce a compound of the general formula I in the form of a free acid or in the form of a salt, by a process according to the invention, it is generally advantageous to use a compound in which Rx denotes a carboxyl blocking group. When it is desired to produce a compound of the general formula I in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable ester, it is generally convenient to use a compound in which Rx denotes the desired ester group.The process step according to the invention involves the elimination of the elements of a compound H X from a penem or penem intermediate of the general part formula III, in which X denotes a hydroxy group or a leaving group. In the case where X denotes a hydroxy group, the compound of the formula H X being eliminated is water and the elimination reaction is a dehydration reaction, which may suitably be carried out by treating a compound of the general part formula III with a compound of the general formula VI R602C N N C02R7 VI in which each of R6 and R7, which may be identical or different, denotes aryl, C1 6 alkyl or aryl C1 6 alkyl, and a with compound of the general formula VII EMI16.1 in which each of a, b and c which may be identical or different, denotes 0 or 1, and each of R8, R9 and R10, which may be identical or different, denotes aryl, C1 6 alkyl or aryl C16 alkyl. In the compounds of the general formula VI, R6 and R7 are preferably selected from methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, phenyl, and benzyl, the ethyl and isopropyl groups being preferred. Advantageously, R6 and R7 may be identical. A preferred compound of the general formula VI is diethyl azodicarboxylate.Preferred compounds of the general formula VII include triarylphosphines and trialkylphosphites. Preferred groups R8, R9 and R10 include methyl, ethyl, n propyl, n butyl, benzyl, phenyl and methoxyphenyl.Advantageously, R8, R9 and R10 are all identical. A preferred compound of the general formula VII is triphenylphosphine.Advantageously, approximately two equivalents of each the compounds of the general formulae VI and VII are used per mole of the compound of the general part formula III.The dehydration reaction may suitably be carried out at a non extreme temperature, for example a temperature of from 200C to 1000C. It may be convenient to begin the reaction at a depressed temperature, for example OOC, and then to allow the temperature to rise to about room temperature.The reaction may suitably be carried out in an inert aprotic organic solvent. Suitable solvents include tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, ethyl acetate, benzene, and dichloromethane.In the cases where X, in general formula III, denotes a leaving group, which will hereinafter be referred to asX1, it may suitably be a halogen atom or a group of one of the formulae 0 S02 0 n Rll VIIIA O CO O n R11 VIIIB or 0 PO OR12 2 VIIIC in which n denotes 0 or 1, Rll denotes C1 6 alkyl, aryl or aryl C1 6 alkyl, andR12 denotes C1 6 alkyl or aryl.Preferred groups of formula VIIIB are those in which n denotes zero and R11 denotes C16 alkyl, especially the acetoxy group.The elimination of the elements of a compound of the general formula II in which X denotes a leaving groupX1 from a compound of the general formula III,may suitably be effected by treating the compound of the general formula III with a base in an aprotic medium.Suitable bases for that purpose include, for example, powdered inorganic bases, for example alkali metal carbonates, bicarbonates, hydroxides, and hydrides e.g. powdered potassium carbonate , and also organic bases of low nucleophilicity, for example 1,8 diazabicycloE5.4.0 undec 7 ene. Suitable solvents for use as the aprotic medium in this reaction include, for example, dimethylformamide, hexamethylphosphoramide, dichloromethane, and tetrahydrofuran.The elimination may suitably be effected at a low temperature, for example a temperature of from 700C to 700C, advantageously from 400C to OOC. The compounds of the general formula III in which X denotes a leaving group xl may suitably be prepared from the corresponding compound in which X denotes a hydroxy group by replacing the hydroxy group by a leaving group X1. Alternatively, in the case of the compounds of the general formula IIID below, the leaving group xl may be introduced into the molecule at an earlier stage in the synthesis of the penem nucleus. In particular, a group xl of the formula VIIIA or VIIIB may be introduced at the beginning of, or at any stage during, the synthesis of the penem. In each case, the group X1 may suitably be introduced by replacing a hydroxyl group in known manner. The dehydration or other elimination reaction of the process according to the invention may be carried out at any suitable stage during the preparation of the penem of the general formula I or salt or ester thereof, suitably at an early stage or late stage in the manufacturing process.Further examples of suitable leaving groups will be apparent to those skilled in the art and include sulphoxide, selenoxide and xanthate groups, which can be eliminated by known methods see W. Carruthers, Some modern methods of organic synthesis , CambridgeUniv. Press 1978 2nd edition , pages 93 103 .In particular, the dehydration or other elimination reaction may be carried out on a compound of the general formula IIIC EMI20.1 in whichR1, R2 and X are defined as above,R17 denotes C1 6 alkyl, aryl, aryl C16 alkyl, C1 6 alkylthio, arylthio, hetero aromatic thio, acyl for example, C16 alkylcarbonyl, especially acetyl , C2 6 alkenyl especially vinyl , or aryl C26 alkenyl, all of which may optionally be substituted, and R18 denotes hydrogen or an N protecting group, to give a compound of the general formula IVC EMI20.2 in which, R1, R2, R17 and R18 are defined as above, which may then subsequently be converted to a penem of the general formula I or salt or ester thereof in known manner, suitably by a conventional penem preparation method.Alternatively, the dehydration or other elimination reaction may be carried out on a compound of the general formula II ID EMI21.1 in which R1, R2, R16 Rx and X are defined as above, to give a compound of the general formula IVD EMI21.2 in which R1, R2, R16 and Rx are defined as above, and thereafter, if necessary or desired a removing any carboxyl blocking group Rx, and or b converting the group R16 into a group or atom R3, and or c converting the product into the free acid or into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or in vivo hydrolysable ester.The conversion of a compound of the general formula IVC to the desired penem may suitably proceed via a compound of the general formula IVD, according to known penem preparation methods.A compound of the general formula IIID, especially one in which X denotes a leaving group X1, may conveniently be prepared from a compound of the general formulaIIIC, especially one in which X denotes a leaving groupX1, according to known penem preparation methods.In a compound of the general formula IIIB or IIIC, R13 or R17, respectively, may suitably denote a triphenylmethyl group. Examples of suitableN protecting groups, R14 or R18 include silyl groups, for example t butyldimethylsilyl groups.In the general formula IIID and IVD, the group R16 may be a group convertible into R3 during the penem preparation process. One particular example of such a group, which may conveniently be used in the preparation of a group R3 of the formula SR4 in whichR4 is defined as above , is the group of the formulaIX EMI22.1 in which R15 denotes an organic radical different from the group R4.A sulphoxide compound of the general formula IIID orIVD in which R16 denotes a group of the formula IX may be reacted with a thiol of the general formula XI R4 SH XI in which R4 is defined as above, or a reactive derivative thereof, to give a compound of the general formula IIID or IVD in which R16 denotes a group of the formula XII S R4 XII in which R4 is defined as above.The reaction of the sulphoxide with the thiol may be carried out as described in European Patent PublicationNo. EP 0 046 363A.A sulphoxide compound of the general formula IIID orIVD in which R16 denotes a sulphoxide group of the formula IX above may be prepared by S oxidation of a compound of the general formula IIID or IVD, respectively, in which R16 denotes a group of the formula S R15. The S oxidation may be effected using a mild oxidising agent, for example a perbenzoic acid, hydrogen peroxide, selenium dioxide or sodium metaperiodate. Perbenzoic acids, for example m chloroperbenzoic acid, are preferred. The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of a compound of the general formula I in which R3 denotes a group of the formula SR4 in whichR4 is defined as above , or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or in vivo hydrolysable ester thereof, which comprises reacting a compound of the general formula XIII EMI24.1 in whichR1, R21 R15 and Rx are defined as above, with a thiol of the general formula XI above, or a reactive derivative thereof and thereafter if necessary or desired a removing any carboxyl blocking group Rx, and or b converting the product into the free acid or into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or in vivo hydrolysable ester. The compounds of the general formulae IIIC and IVC are novel intermediates and also constitute subjects of the present invention. The compounds of the general formula II ID, in particular those in which R16 denotesR3 or a sulphoxide group of the formula IX, are also novel intermediates and form a further subject of the present invention. The compounds of the general formula IVD in which R16 denotes a sulphoxide group of the formula IX are further novel intermediates and constitute a yet further subject of the present invention.The compounds according to the invention have 5 lactamase inhibitory and antibacterial properties, and are useful for the treatment of infections in animals, especially mammals, including humans, in particular in humans and domesticated including farm animals. The compounds may be used, for example, for the treatment of infections of, inter alia, the respiratory tract, the urinary tract, and soft tissues, especially in humans.The compounds may be used for the treatment of infections caused by strains of, for example,Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella aerogenes,Escherichia coli, Proteus sp., and Bacteroides fragilis. It is generally advantageous to use a compound according to the invention in admixture or conjunction with a penicillin, cephalosporin or other 5 lactam antibiotic and that can often result in a synergistic effect, because of the 5 lactamase inhibitory properties of the compounds according to the invention. In such cases, the compound according to the invention and the other lactam antibiotic can be administered separately or in the form of a single composition containing both active ingredients as discussed in more detail below.The compounds according to the invention are suitably provided in substantially pure form, for example at least 50 pure, advantageously at least 75 pure, preferably at least 95 pure, especially at least 988 pure, all percentages being calculated as weight weight. An impure or less pure form of a compound according to the invention may, for example, be used in the preparation of a more pure form of the same compound or of a related compound for example, a corresponding salt, ester or free acid suitable for pharmaceutical use.Although the purity of any compound used as an intermediate may be less critical than that of a compound used as a final product, for example one used directly for pharmaceutical use for example in a composition according to the invention as described below , nevertheless such an intermediate compound is advantageously provided in substantially pure form. It is generally advantageous to provide the compounds according to the invention in crystalline form.
