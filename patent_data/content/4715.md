# Tire building machine.

## Abstract
A tire building machine of the expandable bead lock type employs an elastomeric specially shaped radially expanding bead lock 52, 53 which includes an air passage system therethrough. The bead locks are expanded by a pneumatic tube 137 which seats the bead lock against reentrant shoulder stops securing the bead locks in their expanded condition both precisely radially and axially with respect to the two centerlines of the machine. Such bead locks may be used in connection with an expandable axially fixed center deck 39 for first stage operations or in connection with a substantially rigid axially expandable and contractible center deck for single stage operations. The bead locks may also be employed for second stage operations. For a single stage machine, the preferred form of center deck includes axially oppositely extending fingers which slide in respective slots in the center support forming a substantially rigid working surface. In connection with single and first stage operations, the bead locks may include integrally formed shaping bladders 48 which are inflated through the air passage system in the bead locks. An additional 49 bladder may be employed at each end of the machine cooperating with the bladder formed integrally with the bead locks for turning tire components about the beads and for assembling components such as sidewalls to the carcass when in a toroidal shape. The bladders are specially constructed and molded so that the components may be wrapped or applied tangentially and sequentially from the bead outwardly to avoid distortion. Components of the machine, whether used as a single stage, first stage, or second stage machine are common.
