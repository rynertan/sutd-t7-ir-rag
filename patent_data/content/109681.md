# process for the preparation of optically active cyanomethyl esters.

## Abstract
Stereoisomerically enriched cyanomethyl esters are pre pared by treating a non symmetrical ketene or an alpha chiral carboxylic acid halide or reactive derivative thereof with an optically active alphahydroxynitrile. Certain optical ly active optionally substituted S alphacyano 3 phenoxy benzyl alcohol intermediates are prepared by treating the corresponding aldehyde of ketone with a source of hydrogen cyanide in the presence of a substantially water immiscible, aprotic solvent and a cyclo D phenylalanyl D histidine as a catalyst.
