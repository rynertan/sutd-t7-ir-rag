# RAPIDLY DISSOLVING GRANULAR HYDRATED CALCIUM HYPOCHLORITE

## Abstract
A rapidly dissolving granular hydrated calcium hypochlorite product is comprised of hydrated calcium hypochlorite particles having at least 95 percent of the particles within a size range of from about 300 to about 850 microns. The product has a packed bulk density of less than about 1.05 grams per cubic centimeter. When dispersed on the surface of a body of water, such as a swimming pool, at least 3 feet deep, about 70 weight percent or higher of the particles dissolve within one minute.
