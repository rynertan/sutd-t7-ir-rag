## Abstract
Method for electrically connecting valve metal anode ribs and cathodically resistant metal cathode ribs through a bipolar plate comprising a valve metal sheet on the anode side and steel plate on the cathode side of the bipolar plate, characterized in that bimetal strips with a valve metal side and a side of a highly conductive metal resistant to hydrogen migration are inserted into grooves cut on the anode side of the steel plate, the valve metal sheet and the valve metal ribs are welded to the valve metal side of the bimetal strips inserted into the grooves of the steel plate and the cathodic ally resistant metal cathode ribs are electrically connected to the highly conductive metal side of the bimetallic strips.
