# PROCESS FOR MANUFACTURE OF SALTS OF CARBOXYMETHYLCELLULOSE.

## Abstract
Disclosed are novel sodium salts of carboxymethylcellu lose CMC prepared from a cellulose furnish having a degree of polymerization D.P. of greater than 1,000 and having a degree of substitution D.S. of 0.2 to 0.9 characterized in that the CMC has an absorbency of at least 25 g. liquid g. CMC and is a substantially nonfibrous particulate material and to pro cesses for preparing same. Owing to their high absorbency properties, they are particularly useful in the manufacture of disposable nonwoven products, such as adult incontinence pads, feminine hygiene products, disposable diapers and sur gical dressings.
