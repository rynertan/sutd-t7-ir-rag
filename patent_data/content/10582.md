# GRAFT POLYESTER PRODUCTS, METHOD OF SIZING YARNS THEREWITH AND A SYNTHETIC FIBER SIZED WITH SUCH GRAFT POLYESTER PRODUCTS

## Abstract
There are disclosed graft polyesters useful as adhesives and coatings and especially useful in processes for sizing spun and continous filament synthetic organic and inorganic fibrous yarn. One embodiment of the invention is a textile size composition having free carboxyl groups which is prepared in situ on a textile yarn by the application of heat or radiation to a mixture of an unsaturated polyester reac tant and a monovinyl monomer reactant comprising an acidic monovinyl monomer having at least one carboxyl group or mixtures thereof with any monovinyl monomer. Desizing can be accomplished by partial neutralization of the size to a pH of at least 6 by reacting the size with a base to render the graft polyester water dispersible or water soluble. Also disclosed are cross linked graft polyesters ob tained by reacting an unsaturated polyester with at least one polyunsaturated vinyl monomer.
