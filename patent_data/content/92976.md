# MEMORY WRITING CONTROL APPARATUS

## Abstract
An apparatus for controlling the writing of data from a processor 1 into a memory 4 having different read and write times, wherein the memory 4 is connected directly to the processor 1 through address 7 and data 8 buses without the use of an input output port. A timer circuit 5 is connected to the buses 7, 8 and memory 4 and is controlled by the processor 1 to produce a write timing signal which controls the writing of data into the memory 4 . The processor 1 is placed in a holding state based on the write timing signal for a period long enough to assure that the data will be written into the memory 4 in its entirety.
