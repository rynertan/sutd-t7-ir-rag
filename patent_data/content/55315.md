# Improvements in or relating to energy management.

## Abstract
An energy management method and apparatus for use in conjunction with a demand limit alternating current circuit having a plurality of separate loads, including resistive loads, and means for automatically shedding certain of the loads when the actual demand of the circuit exceeds the demand limited. The method and apparatus first establish a demand limit for the circuit. When the circuit is in use the actual demand of those loads in operation is sensed, there being a separate sensing of the demands imposed by certain of the operative resistive loads. There is then a reduction in the duty cycle of the power applied to certain ones of the operative resistive loads by switching the loads off and on synchronously with the zero points of the applied voltage, thereby to effect an overall reduction in the actual demand of the circuit when failure to make such a reduction would otherwise cause certain of the operating loads to be completely shed.

## Description
This invention relates to electrical energy management methods and apparatus for use in conjunction with demand limited alternating current circuits having a plurality of separate loads, including resistive loads, and means for automatically shedding certain of said loads when the actual demand of said circuits exceed said demand limit. Various energy management systems have been proposed which require or at least attempt to persuade utility customers to limit their electrical energy consumption as a means of reducing their overall utility bills. According to one such proposal, the maximum load demand which each customer is allowed to place on the utility s power generation facilities is arbitrarily limited. Although this peak usage curtailment approach is partially effective in reducing the customer s overall utility bills, it has several decided disadvantages. The customer, especially a residential user, loses a degree of flexibility in selecting and using various electrical appliances, etc., in his residence and to this extent, the peak usage curtailment program has direct and often undesirable impact on the customer s lifestyle.Secondly, the utility itself may find that the reduction in total electrical energy consumption reduces the utility s revenue to the point that it must, in turn, raise the utility charge per unit of electrical power consumed to the point that the user s electrical utility bills may even exceed the bills he customarily received before his power usage was curtailed. In a variation of the peak usage curtailment approach, each residential customer is allowed to choose his own demand limit and is encouraged to set his own limit to the lowest possible value by imposing considerably higher rates for power used during the utility s peak demand periods. Thus, each consumer can decide for himself the extent to which peak usage curtailment programs will be allowed to interfere with his lifestyle. Whether a demand limit is arbitrarily imposed by the utility or set by the customer, the demand limiting energy management methods and apparatus of the prior art react by automatically shedding loads until the total demand of the circuit is reduced to below the demand limit. In the ideal situation, the value of the load or loads shed would be just equal to the amount by which the actual demand exceeds the demand limit. However, in practice, this rarely occurs and in the more typical situation, the value of the load or loads shed is greater than the excess demand. Thus, when these loads are shed, the resultant actual demand imposed by the remaining loads in operation falls significantly below the demand limit. This has an undesirable effect on both the consumer and the utility.The consumer is forced to do completely without certain appliances and utilize even less power than he is allowed by the demand limit, thus undesirably affecting his lifestyle. From the utility company s standpoint, a reduction in the actual load to below the demand limit is undesirable because its revenues are lowered even though it must keep power generation facilities on line to satisfy the demand limits of all of its customers. Accordingly, it would be highly desirable to provide methods and apparatus for use in connection with demand limit circuits which would function to enable each power consumer to utilize a higher percentage of the allowable power available under his particular demand limit. It is further desirable for a demand limited circuit, operating close to its demand limit, to respond to additional demands or a reduction in demand limit in ways other than by completely shedding one or more loads in the circuit. Finally, it is desirable for such a circuit to respond to increased demands or reduction in demand limits in such fashion as to keep the actual demand of the circuit closer to or equal to the demand limit. According to the present invention there is provided an energy management method for use in conjunction with a demand limited alternating current circuit having a plurality of separate loads, including resistive loads, and means for automatically shedding certain of said loads when the actual demand of said circuit exceeds said demand limit.said method including a establishing a demand limit for said circuits b sensing the actual demand of those loads in said circuit which are in operation, including separately sensing the demands imposed by at least certain of the operative resistive loads in said circuit and c reducing the duty cycle of the applied power furnished to at least certain ones of said operative resistive loads by switching said loads off and on synchronously with the zero points of the applied voltage, to effect an overall reduction in the actual demand of said circuit when the failure to make such reduction would otherwise cause certain of said operating loads to be completely shed. According to the invention there is also provided energymanagement apparatus for use in a demand limited alternating current circuit, which circuit includes a plurality of separate loads, including resistive loads, and means for automatically shedding certain of said loads when the actual demand of said circuit exceeds said demand limit, said apparatus including a means for establishing a demand limit for said circuit b means for sensing the actual demand of those loads in said circuit which are in operation including separately sensing the demand imposed by at least certain of the operative resistive loads in said circuit and c means for reducing the duty cycle of the applied power furnished to at least certain ones of said operative resistive loads by switching said loads off and on synchron ously with the zero points of the applied voltage, to effect an overall reduction in the actual demand of said circuit when the failure to make such reduction would otherwise cause certain of said operating loads to be completely shed. Preferably, a method and apparatus according to the invention adjust the total demand of a circuit which includes a plurality of loads, including resistive loads, to achieve optimum utilization of the allowable power available to a circuit which is demand limited. The invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a block diagram of a demand limited residential circuit containing both controlled and uncontrolled resistive and inductive loads and provided with an apparatus according to the invention for controlling power usage Fig. 2 is a graphical illustration of the incoming power to the circuit of Fig. 1, the controlled signal which regulates the power supplied to certain of the resistive loads of the circuit and the power actually applied to one of the controlled resistive loads and Fig. 3 is a graphical illustration of the power usage in the circuit of Fig. 1 controlled in accordance with the prior art in comparison to a system controlled in accordance with the principles of the present invention. Briefly, in the circuit of Fig. 1 is a demand limited alternating current circuit, which circuit includes a plurality of separate loads, including resistive loads and means for automatically shedding certain of the loads when the actual demand of the circuit exceeds the demand limit. The method and apparatus of the present invention include the steps of and means for establishing a demand limit for the circuit, sensing the actual demand of those loads in the circuit which are then in operation, including sensing the demands imposed by at least certain of the operative resistive loads in the circuit, and reducing the duty cycle of the applied power furnished to at least certain ones of the operative resistive loads to effect an overall reduction in the actual demand of the circuit when the failure to make such reduction would otherwise cause certain of the operating loads to be completely shed. The methods and apparatus of the invention make use of the fact that the power consumed by a resistive load is directly reduced by reducing the duty cycle of the alternating current supplied to the load. Thus, for example, the power consumed by an electrical hot water heater will be reduced by 1070 by reducing the duty cycle of the current to the heating element by 10 . Thus, if the desired reduction in the total demand of a circuit can be effected by this technique rather than by completely shedding the water heater load, the consumer can still have hot water in reduced volume and yet the utility company s revenues are not reduced by the full normal demand of the water heater but only by 10 . Turning now to the drawings, Fig. 1 illustrates a typical residential circuit 11 consisting of uncontrolled resistive loads RU and uncontrolled inductive loads LU and controlled resistive loads Rl, R2 ... Rns and controlled inductive loads L1, L2 ... Ln Incoming power from the utility transmission lines 12 passes through a load sensor 13 which measures the total current applied to all of the loads in the circuit 11 and is transmitted directly to the uncontrolled loads through electrical conductors 14. Power to the controlled loads is transmitted via conductor 15 to a load control system 16 which contains a load control device LC for each of the controlled resistive and inductive loads of the circuit 11.The load control devices for the inductive loads, LCL1, LCL2 ... LCLn preferably relays pass current directly from the conductor 15 to the inductive loads L1, L2 ... Ln in response to receipt of command signals 17 from the logic of a microprocessor 18. Power from the conductor 15 is passed through duty cycle control devices TRIACs and then to the resistive loads R1, R2 ... R . The microprocessor logic receives R1, n information as to the frequency of the incoming power from a transformer 19 which generates a frequency information signal 21 and from the load sensor 13 which generates and transmits a total actual demand signal 22. Load priority and demand limit information is entered by the utility and or consumer at the control panel 23 which generates demand limit and add shed priority signals 24.The microprocessor generates ON OFF signals 25 which control the operation of the TRIACs In operation, the system of Fig. 1 operates as follows. The microprocessor senses which of the controlled resistive and inductive loads are actually in operation and the value of those operative loads. The microprocessor also reads the total demand signal 22. If the total demand exceeds the preselected demand limit, the microprocessor scans the operative resistive loads and according to customer selected priority, determines whether a reduction in power to one or more of the operative controlled resistive loads can be effected to reduce the actual demand to the value equal to the demand limit.The microprocessor then selects a percentage reduction in the duty cycle of the power to be supplied to the controlled operative resistive loads and generates ON OFF signals to the TRIACs of the resistive loads selected for duty cycle reduction. The TRIACs react to the ON OFF commands from the microprocessor to steal cycles from the incoming power and apply the reduced duty cycle power to the selected controlled resistive loads. The operation of the system is further illustrated by reference to Fig. 2 which is a graphic comparison of the incoming power, TRIAC control signals and power applied to a resistive load. As is well known to those skilled in the art, a TRIAC reacts to a CURRENT OFF signal applied at any point in the power or current cycle to cause the current to be interrupted the next time the current passes through zero and reacts to a POWER ON signal to conduct current any time the ON signal is applied. By proper timing of the application of the ON and OFF signals to the TRIAC, one can then subtract entire cycles from the incoming power and proportionately reduce the power consumption of the load. Thus, as illustrated inFig. 2, if the OFF signal 31 is applied to the TRIAC at any time during the last half of the incoming power cycle A, power will be applied to the load during the entire cycle A. However, when the incoming power during the last half of cycle A passes through zero, the TRIAC will interrupt the current flow.An ON control signal 32 applied at the beginning of cycle C will cause the TRIAC to conduct and power cycleC will be applied to the load. It will be understood to those skilled in the art that the ON signal 32 could be applied at any portion of the incoming power cycle.B, causing the TRIAC to conduct and applying power to the load. However, in order to avoid generating voltage or current transients, the ON signal 32 is applied as the incoming power and current passed through zero at the commencement of cycle C. The points at which cycles are subtracted from the incoming power can be spaced apart to minimize the effect of the duty cycle reduction on the resistive load so as, for example, to avoid flickering of banks of incandescent lights.For example, with an incoming 60 cycle signal, the microprocessor logic would preferably generate command signals to a TRIAC to subtract one cycle every 10 cycles, in order to effect a 107. reduction in the power applied to the load. The effect of the methods and apparatus of the invention on the consumption in a typical residential circuit is illustrated inFig. 3. It is assumed that the residential consumer has selected a 10 KW demand limit and it is assumed that the combination of controlled and uncontrolled loads in operation in his residence imposes an actual demand of 8 KW, as shown during period A. Finally, it is assumed that according to user selected priority, the first load to be shed in the event of an increase in demand to above the demand limit is a 6 KW resistive load. At the beginning of period B, it is assumed that another uncontrolled load of 3 KW is placed in operation by the consumer. In a non demand limited circuit, this would cause the demand to rise to the total of 11 KW, as indicated by the dashed line 31. In a demandlimited circuit of the prior art, the 6 KW load selected by the consumer would be automatically shed, reducing the actual demand of the entire residential circuit to only 5 KW, depriving the consumer entirely of the use of the 6 Kw load and reducing the utility company s revenues because the demand limited system could only respond to the increased demand by completely shedding the 6 Kw load. However, by contrast, an energy management system embodying the present invention would react to the situation by simply reducing the power applied to the 6 KW resistive load by 16 7., thus reducing the total demand from 11 KW to 10 KW, the demand limit, and the consumer retains the use at 90 of its capacity of the nominal 6 KW load and the utility company actually obtains increased revenue, as indicated by the power shaded area 32 representing power actually utilized by the consumer which would not be utilized in accordance with the prior art.
