# A flat electrical cable.

## Abstract
A thin profile electrical cable is rendered capable of enduring compressive and tensile loading encountered in under carpet usage by encasing separately in the same flat pliable jacket 14 the conductor 10 to be protected and parallel to it one or more hard cable like stress carrying members 24,25 which are afforded free slippage within the jacket 14 in the direction of their lengths. The jacket surface is scored by parallel grooves 19,20,21 in the vicinity of the embedded conductor 10 to cause compressive loads to be borne by the stress carrying members 24,25 .
