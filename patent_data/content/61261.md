# Polyurethane molding process with siloxane internal release agent.

## Abstract
An improved polyurethane RIM process using a polycar boxy functional alkyl siloxane as an internal release agent characterized by 1 Tool break in or preconditioning with siloxane treatment of the surfaces 2 Supplying the siloxane to the mix head as a third stream when necessary to prevent undesired side reactions 3 Using a minimal amount of siloxane that is in adequate for mold release in the absence of the tool preconditioning 4 Adjustment of catalyst package to counter the inhibiting effects of the siloxane. The use of a bare minimal amount of siloxane prevents excess siloxane from appearing in the surface of the article and causing subsequent paint wet out and like difficulties. The third stream isolating of the siloxane prevents its carboxy functional groups from reacting with the prepolym er or with other ingredients that may be carried in the polyol blend.

## Description
TITLE Polyurethane molding process with siloxane internal release agent. TECHNICAL FIELD This invention is a process of molding polyurethanes using a polycarboxy functional siloxane as an internal release agent. More specifically, it is concerned with an improved polyurethane reaction injection molding hereinafter RIM process wherein a tricarboxy functional alkyl siloxane internal release agent is used in a critically minimal amount in conjunction with an optimization of the ret.hane catalyst package and a specific mold preparation or seasoning procedure. In this improved RIM process, the siloxane release agent may desirably be introduced to the mix head as a third stream separate from the catalyst containing polyol stream and the isocyanate stream because each of these streams often contains ingredients unduly reactive with the carboxy functional siloxane. BACKGROUND ART Polyurethane RIM processes are capable of very fast cycle times. It is necessary that the molded article release from the mold cavity quickly and well. Externally applied release agents have been used on the mold cavity surfaces but, as is well known, their use suffers from such problems as the need to apply the release agent each cycle, non uniformity of application, build up and fouling of the mold and contamination of the surface of the molded article making subsequent finishing of the surface difficult. Also, loss of surface smoothness, sheen or gloss is quite apparent. The surfaces of such molded urethane articles usually have a matte appearance because of the mold release agents applied to the mold surfaces. For these reasons, the art has turned to the use of internal release agents which are mixed with the polyurethane ingredients and thus are present during each molding cycle. The release agents appear at the interface between the mold cavity wall and the reacting ingredients and effect sufficient non adherence between the two so that release and ejection of the molded article can be accomplished. The United States Patents Nos. 4,076,695 and 4,111,861 disclose the use of internal release agents and their disclosures are incorporated by reference. This invention is a specific improvement over the process disclosed in Patent No. 4,076,695.In the process of this patent, there is a critical balance, difficult to achieve as a practical matter, between having present sufficient of the siloxane mold release agent to effect satisfactory release repetitiously, cycle after cycle, without mold fouling, and having too much present such that the release agent appears on the surface of the molded article and interferes with subsequent painting of the molded article, e.g., causing poor wetting out and fisheying of the paint, or poor adherence of the paint film. Also, the siloxane greatly inhibits the cure of the urethane and that must be compensated for. TI e present invention is specifically directed to the polyurethane RIM processes disclosed in United States Patent Nos. 4,048,205 and 4,102,833, by one of the present inventors, using the compositions set out in these patents, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference. FIGURE IN THE DRAWING Other advantages of the present invention will be readily appreciated as the same becomes understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawing when the drawing schematically illustrates the subject process. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention is a process wherein the ingredients for a polyurethane composition are brought together and reacted in a mold cavity to form a molded article which ingredients include a normally liquid carboxy functional siloxane internal mold release agent hereinafter, CFS . The improvement of this invention comprises dividing the reaction ingredients into at least two components, viz. a an isocyanate containing component free of CFS, b a polyol containing component containing the CFS and free of material that will so react with the CFS as to cause, inter alia, objectional gelling. The polyol stream contains an amount of curing agent and catalyst sufficient to overcome the inhibiting effects of the CFS which amount would make the system inoperable in the absence of the CFS. When curing agents and catalysts are used that are unduly reactive with the CFS in a polyol blend, then a three stream system is used. In addition to the isocyanate stream, the polyol stream is divided into two parts one which contains the catalyst and curing agent and is free of CFS and another which contains the CFS and is free of ingredients that would react undesirably with the CFS. It has been the experience of the inventors that with certain polyols extenders and or catalyst packages that objectional gelling may occur in the polyol stream containing them and the CFS. Examination of such gels has established that the CFS is a part of the gel structure.Generally speaking, if a 1000 c.c. sample of a polyol stream containing CFS and the other desired ingredients will not show objectional gelling after being held for 24 hours at 1000F under nitrogen with agitation, then it is probably safe to use a two stream system. Otherwise, a three stream feed system should be preferred. The internal surfaces of the mold cavity containing the reacting ingredient are preconditioned by uniformly and thinly applying the CFS thereto and seasoning the surfaces by repeating several molding cycles with intermittent reapplication of the CFS as required, following which at least one hundred molding cycles can be effected with good release and without further application of theCFS to the surfaces. The amount of CFS in the reactive ingredients is kept to a minimal amount, less than 0.5 weight percent, and preferably less than 0.3 weight percent, which is just sufficient to effect adequate release with the mold properly preconditioned but is inadequate in the absence of the preconditioning of the mold. The urethane catalyst package of an amine and an organic heavy metal compound is optimized to overcome the inhibiting effects of the CFS by approximately doubling the amount of amine normally used and approximately quadrupling the amount of the heavy metal compound. In some instances, an amine will not be used. The amount of amine, if used, is usually greater than 2.5 parts by weight and the amount of organometal compound is greater than 0.1 parts by weight. In the absence of the CFS this amount of catalyst would make the system so reactive as to severely limit processability. In the preconditioning of the mold, the procedure used is to thoroughly clean the internal mold surfaces as by polishing with a mild abrasive containing compound, e.g. jeweler s rouge, followed by application of a solution of the CFS and thorough buffing to remove all excess CFS. Thereafter as many molding cycles as possible are carried out until some sticking is observed or the effort necessary to effect mold opening substantially increases. The cleaning, CFS application and buffing steps are then repeated. Eventually, usually within 2 to 10 cleaning buffing cycles, equilibrium is achieved where no further external application of CFS to the internal mold surface is required such that with the maintenance of the proper minimal amount of the CFS in the reacting ingredients, repetitious mold opening and quick release of the molded article can be accomplished without difficulty.This mold break in procedure has been successfully applied to molds made of aluminum, nickel and aluminum oxide. While this is a fairly extensive tool break in procedure, it is well worth the effort inasmuch as it elimiates subsequent problems in painting or otherwise finishing the molded surface of the article and substantially reduces rejects. Another unexpected advantage found during the course of the research work leading to this invention was that the surface finish, i.e. sheen, gloss, reflectivity, of the article as molded is much improved as compared to molded urethane articles where the mold release is applied directly to the mold surface, so much so that the molded product can be considered to be unique. The Distinctness of Image DOI of the as molded surface of the product of this invention is at least eight units and is usually fifteen units higher than the same product made and demolded in the conventional manner.For a description of the DOI reflectometer and test seeGeneral Motors Engineering Standard GM 9101P, Test forEvaluating Paint Film Distinction of Image . An interesting phenomenon of this improved procedure is that it appears that better release is obtained the faster the reaction rate of the polyurethane composition.The reason for this is not known. However, it is possible that the faster reaction times allow for less wetting of and thus adherence to the mold surfaces. It is preferred to use total shot times from the time the ingredients are brought together in the mixing head until they are injected in the mold cavity of less than 3 seconds and to have reaction times to mold openings of less than 60 seconds, usually less than 40 seconds. The following table gives the proportions of the ingredients that can be used to prepare the urethane.These ingredients are known as are the amounts to be used except that the amount of the internal release additive required is less and the amount of catalyst is greater.This table also gives three examples of the invention.

In the drawing, the three separate streams, i.e. the polyol with siloxane line 10 , the polyol free of siloxane line 11 and the prepolymer line 12 are introduced into the mixing chamber of an injection molding machine 13. The ingredients are almost instantaneously mixed and injected into the mold cavity of mold 14. As indicated at 15, the mold has been prepared by polishing the mold surfaces and application of the siloxane thereto such that repetitious molding cycles can now be carried out without further mold preparation or cleaning. After a short cure time the molded article 16 is ejected from the mold. With reference to Example I, the mixing and injection molding machine used is a standard one a Mobay HC 1000 modified in house to meter the three streams. The pressure at the mix head is 2250 pounds per square inch and the time to injection in the mold is 2 seconds. Cycle time for injection to mold opening is 40 seconds. Total cycle time is 120 seconds. The part made is a 1980 Chevrolet Monza front upper fascia. An aluminum mold is used and the internal surfaces are prepared by a polishing with a rubbing compound 6065 supplied by E. l. DuPont de Nemours s Co., Wilmington, Delaware b wiping on CFS, the above identified Q 2 7119, as supplied c buffing the surfaces dry d commencing molding until release failure occurs e repeating this sequence 9 times.After this precondition or seasoning of the mold, more than 150 of the front fascia parts are made without need to clean or treat the internal mold surface or without increase in mold release effort. The molding run is terminated voluntarily. Example I illustrates a preferred embodiment of the invention wherein the ingredients for a polyurethaneforming composition are brought together and reacted in a mold cavity to form a molded article, with the ingredients including a normally liquid polycarboxy functional alkyl siloxane internal mold release agent hereinafter, CFS .This embodiment comprises I. dividing the ingredients into three components, viz a an isocyanate containing component free of the CFS and free of polyol b a polyol containing component free of the CFS and containing material that will react un desirably with the CFS, e.g. amine curing agent and or organometallic catalyst, the amount of the curing agent and organometallic catalyst being sufficient to make the ingredients nonprocessable in the absence of the CFS and, c a polyol containing component containing the CFS and free of material that will react unduly with the CFS. II. preconditioning the surfaces of the mold cavity contacting the ingredients by cleaning with a mild abrasive and uniformly and thinly applying CFS thereto and repeating several molding cycles with intermittent cleaning and reapplication of the CFS as required following which at least 100 molding cycles can be effected with good release and without further application of CFS to said surfaces, and III. maintaining the CFS present in the ingredients in a minimal amount which is sufficient to effect adequate release with the preconditioning and inadequate in the absence of the preconditioning. Example II was used to manufacture a 1977 ChevroletMonza front upper fascia with a modified Henneke RIM machine. The pressure at the mixhead was 2250 psi and the time to injection in the mold was 1.5 seconds. Cycle time for injection to mold opening was 40 seconds. The same type of aluminum mold was used and was prepared in the same manner as described for Example I. The example composition gave more than 30 consecutive releases. The run was stopped voluntarily.
