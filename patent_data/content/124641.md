# Radiant energy collector for use in an optical grating system.

## Abstract
An optical scale or grating system 150 is provided which receives a reference beam 118 of radiant energy vertically aligned with a fine beam 60 which may be comprised of 22 individual rays, the bar collector 162 receiving the reference beam across the length of every scan line. The bar collector 162 directs the radiant energy from the reference beam 118 to a sensor 166 which provides electrical signals indicating the position of the fine beam 60 along the scan line.
