# ELECTROPHOTOGRAPHIC COPYING MACHINE.

## Abstract
An electrophotographic copying machine of the type in which electrostatic latent images formed on a recording medium are developed with toner particles, the developed visible images of the toner particles being transferred onto a transfer papier. There is provided a discharging device including a shield plate having a pair of side plates, one 32d of which is located in front in the direction of forward movement of the recording medium. The side plate 32d is spaced apart a certain predetermined distance from the surface of the recording medium, whereby the electric field applied between them is maintained at an intensity of less than 2 kV cm. Conductive electrode plates 241, 321 are provided close to the paper as well as the moving image support retaining the visible images of the toner particles, namely the recording medium. A voltage having the same polarity as the toner particles is applied to these conductive electrode plates.
