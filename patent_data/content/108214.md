# Watertight slide fastener stringer.

## Abstract
A watertight slide fastener stringer comprises a series of coupling elements 52 mounted on a watertight stringer tape 51 along a longitudinal edge portion thereof. Each coupling element includes a pair of upper and lower halves or members disposed one on each side of the stringer tape and joined by at least one integral connector extending through the stringer tape. Each of the coupling element members has a coupling portion 63 including a support portion 64 placed on a thickened sealing member 56 which is disposed on the longitudinal tape edge, a neck portion 65 on the support portion 64 , and a coupling head 66 on the support portion 64 integral with the neck portion 65 and projecting from the thickened sealing member. The support portion 64 and the neck portion 65 jointly define therebetween a pair of recesses opening away from the plane of the stringer tape 51 for receiving therein the coupling heads 66 of mating coupling elements. A layer 68, 69 made of a cured adhesive material is disposed on each side of the stringer tape 51 at least around the integral connector to prevent water leakage between opposite sides of the coupled fastener stringers.
