# Metal alloys for making alloys with ultra fine uniformly dispersed crystalline phase.

## Abstract
Boron containing transition metal alloys based on one or more of iron, cobalt and nickel, and containing at least two metal components, which are at least 50 percent amorphous. These amorphous alloys can be devitrified under specific heat treatment conditions to provide alloys having an ultrafine crystalline metallic phase interspersed with boride particles as described in the parent application Publication number 0018096 A .
