## Description
The present invention relates to a circuit for processing ultrasonic information for providing a simultaneous display of velocity profiles and a display of an average blood flow velocity with great accuracy, and more praticularly to an ultrasonic bloodstream diagnostic apparatus using this circuit for providing a display of velocity profiles as a function of time. Ultrasonic Doppler shift imaging techniques have found extensive use in medical applications where it is desired to obtain the spectrum of bloodstream in a B scan mode on a real time basis. In order to provide dual displays of velocity profiles and average flow velocity, an ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus comprises a quadrature phase detector which detects phase quadrature Doppler shifted signals. Those signals are digitized and fed to a digital frequency analyzer to obtain real and imaginary components of frequency spectrum. In order to determine the direction of the blood flow the frequency spectrum data is passed through a squaring circuit and a summing amplifier to obtain power spectrum data. The power spectrum data is then fed to a logarithmic processor to reduce the number of data bits representing the power spectrum to adapt the data to the dynamic range of B scan monitor with respect to the size and cost of a scan converter and a digital to analog converter which are provided to process the power spectrum data into a form which is suitable for displaying. Recently developed techniques employ microprocessors for deriving an average frequency of the power spectrum from the compressed power spectrum data for displaying an average flow velocity of bloodstream simultaneously with velocity profiles. However, the logarithmic compression of data bits results in an average frequency value which is inaccurate due to the nonlinearity of the logarithm. From document US 4,305,063 the use of an automatic digital gain ranging system is known wherein read in data are converted into a standard format which represents a certain range and the corresponding data in a 10 bit wide word. Furthermore, from pages 91 to 97 of the Encyclopedia of Computer Science, Van Nostrand Reinhold Company, 1978, some difficulties in connection with calculations by means of computers and the number systems used therefore as well as the conversion of the same are known. In this document different methods of calculation in case of fixed point numbers and floating point numbers are presented and explained in an exemplary manner.

The present invention will be described in further detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Referring now to Fig. 1, there is shown an ultrasonic bloodstream diagnostic apparatus according to the present invention. Illustrated at 1 is an ultrasonic probe placed in contact with the body of a patient 2. The probe 1 is excited by a transmit circuit 3 either in a continuous or pulsed mode to emit acoustic energy into a vessel 4 or the patient body to be examined. Acoustic energy reflecting from the vessel carries Doppler shift information representing the flow rate of the blood stream. The returning energy is detected by the same acoustic probe and sent to a quadrature phase detector 6 after amplifcation by a receive circuit 5. A reference signal generator 7 supplies reference phase quadrature signals to the phase detector 6 to generate output signals Va and Vb representing the Doppler frequency shifts. The doppler shift signals Va and Vb are supplied to an analog to digital converter 8, where each input signal is sampled and quantized to a 10 bit digital signal representing the flow rate of blood with a resolution of 2ยนโฐ. The quantized signals are interleaved with each other to produce a multiplexed signal which is applied to a frequency analyzer 9 which analyzes the signal at prescribed frequency points of the spectrum, typically 128 points, using fast Fourier transformation technique, to detect the frequency spectrum of the Doppler shift. This frequency analysis is accomplished for a period of up to several tens of milliseconds to provide real time display of the spectrum. The results of the frequency analysis are represented by a 16 bit digital signal Vr indicating the real part of the spectrum data and a 16 bit digital signal Vi indicating the imaginary part. The output signals Vr and Vi of the frequency analyzer 9 are multiplexed at the input of a squaring circuit 10 where each component is squared and demultiplexed from the other component. The square values of the real and imaginary components Vr and Vi are each represented by 16 bit data which are summed in an adder 11. As is known in the art, the summation of the squared real and imaginary parts generates a signal indicating the direction of blood flow at the output of the adder 11. Since the output of the adder 11 is represented by 16 bit data as obtained by the squaring circuit 10, it is necessary to reduce the number of bits to be processed at later stages. This reduction can be achieved by removing insignificant bits and compressing the remainder into a series of significant bits. This is accomplished by a data compression circuit 12 and an overflow detector 18. In a preferred embodiment, the data compression circuit 12 comprises a read only memory having a capacity of, typically, 32 kilobits. The higher two bits and lower two bits of the 16 bit output of adder 11 are eliminated and the intermediate 12 bits are applied as address data to the memory 12. The lower two bits in the least significant positions are quantum noise. Thus, the elimination of a total of four bits results in a series of 12 significant bits which are applied in parallel to read only memory 12 as address data. The memory 12 stores 8 bit data comprising 5 bits of mantissa and 3 bits of index which have been prepared in accordance with an algorithm shown in Figs. 2A to 2D. Each 8 bit datum is stored in a location addressible as a function of a particular value of the 12 bit input from the adder 11. The stored 8 bit datum comprises a sequence of 5 bits respectively corresponding to those of 5 bits in the 12 bit address datum which are preceded by a series of binary 0 s. The 5 bit mantissa includes a binary 1 in the most significant bit position thereof and is appended by a 3 bit index which indicates the floating point of the mantissa which in turn corresponds to the least significant bit position of the mantissa with respect to the least significant bit position of the 12 bit address data structure. The data compression algorithm will be best understood by the following description given with reference to Figs. 2a to 2d. Assume that a 12 bit datum from adder 11 is 000000011111 as shown at Fig. 2a, an 8 bit output datum 11111000 is read out of the memory 12. The higher 5 bits indicates a mantissa corresponding to the lower 5 binary 1 s of the 12 bit input and the lower 3 bits indicates an index representing the floating point, or least significant bit position of the higher 5 bits with respect to the significant bit position of the input address data. In Fig. 2a, the least significant bit of the 5 bit mantissa corresponds to the least significant position of the 12 bit data and thus the floating point of the mantissa is at the zero th decimal place in the floating point notation and is represented by a 3 bit datum 000 . Likewise, a 12 bit input 000111000000 , as shown in Fig. 2b, addresses a memory location storing an 8 bit output datum 11100100 , wherein the higher 5 bits 11100 indicates a mantissa and lower 3 bits 100 represents the fourth decimal place. Therefore, an 8 bit output datum of the same value 11111111 will be generated for a set of 12 bit inputs ranging from 111110000000 to 111111111111 as shown in Figs. 2c and 2d. This means that there is a maximum error of the lower seven bits 1111111 . However, this error accounts for only about 3 percent of possible input bit combinations which is negligible for practical purposes. To compensate for errors which would be introduced by the elimination of the 15 th bit position of the adder output data, an overflow detector 18 is connected to the 15 th bit position of the output of the adder 11 to detect the presence of a binary 1 in that bit position. Upon the detection of a binary 1 in the 15 th bit position, the overflow detector 18 generates a 12 bit address which causes the memory 12 to read out an 8 bit output data of the maximum value 11111111 . The output of the data compression memory 12 is fed to an averaging circuit 17, or a microprocessor, which derives an average value of Doppler shift frequencies from the power spectrum and proceeds to detect the average flow velocity V according to the following equation where, ฮf is the average frequency, fo is the frequency of the acoustic energy, C is the velocity of propagation of acoustic energy within tissues, and ฯ represents the angle between the direction of acoustic energy and the vector of bloodstream. The average flow velocity data is displayed on a video monitor 16. Since the propagation velocity C is known as approximately 1,540 meters per second, the average flow velocity V is readily obtained by the angle ฯ. The compressed data is also applied to a scan converter 13 where the scan format of the ultrasonic probe 1 is converted to the raster scan format of a video monitor 16. The compressed data is reconverted to the original 12 bit data and compressed to an 8 bit format according to logarithmic algorithm for adaptation to a digital to analog converter 15 and monitor 16. This is accomplished by a data conversion circuit 14 which is formed by a read only memory storing 8 bit data. The stored 8 bit data are derived from the reconversion of the 8 bit compressed data to the original 12 bit data and the logarithmic conversion of the latter to an 8 bit format. The 8 bit data are stored in locations addressible as a function of the particular value of 8 bit compressed datum. The 8 bit data read out of the memory 14 is converted to an analog signal by D A converter 15 and displayed in a raster scan format by the monitor 16 simultaneously with the average flow rate supplied from the averaging circuit 17.
