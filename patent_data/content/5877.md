# PROCESS FOR DECOMPOSING HARD METAL SCRAP

## Abstract
The process is principally based upon an electrochemical technique due to which the binding material for tungsten and cobalt is dissolved and from the solution under certain conditions cobalt or its composition is regained. From the undissolved material after electrolysis tungsten is disposed. By this improved method a very fast decomposition of the hard metal is obtained. Tungsten carbide scrap a waste material from hard metal tools can be decomposed preferably by electrolysis.
