# Apparatus for determining hydrocarbon combustion efficiency and method and apparatus for analyzing i.c. engine faults.

## Abstract
An apparatus and method for determining fuel burn ing efficiency in articles which require hydrocarbon com bustion for operation, such as noncatalytic converter equipped internal combustion engines, hot water heaters, furnaces and the like. The invention includes a three gas analyzer which measures the amount of carbon monoxide, oxygen and hydrocarbon in the emissions of the exhaust system.
