# Sampled signal generation circuit.

## Abstract
A sampled data generation circuit includes a voltage controlled oscillator 12 for producing an output signal with a frequency variable according to a control voltage, a sample and hold circuit 10 for sampling and holding an analog input signal in response to the output signal from the voltage controlled oscillator 12 , and a control circuit 14 for detecting the difference between two successive sampled data generated from the sample and hold circuit 10 and supplying the voltage con trolled oscillator 12 with an output signal correspond ing to the difference as the control voltage, thereby controlling the voltage controlled oscillator 12 so that the greater the difference, the higher the frequency of the output signal from the voltage controlled oscillator 12 is.
