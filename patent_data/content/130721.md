# COOLANT APPLICATOR

## Abstract
A coolant applicator is described in which a flexible, aper tured plate 36 is hydraulically loaded so the flexible plate is brought close to the surface to be cooled coolant is supplied to pass through and form a hydrostatic bearing layer between the plate and the surface, and the plate being deformed to the shape of the surface by the hydraulic loading. In one embodiment a hydraulically loaded coolant applying pad comprises a piston cylinder assembly 14, 16 is connected to a supply of coolant under pressure, while the piston 16 is hollow to allow passage of the coolant, and a flexible plate 36 movably mounted on the piston, has apertures in fluid connection with the cylinder 14 via the piston 16 , and is arranged so that, in use, coolant passing through the apertures in the plate 36 forms a hydrostatic bearing layer between the plate 36 and the surface.
