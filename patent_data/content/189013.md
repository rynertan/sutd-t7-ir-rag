# Power transmission arrangement in a tractor.

## Abstract
In a four wheel drive tractor, the power is transmitted from the tractor gearbox 3 or from a separate power take off gearbox to the differential gear 9 of the driving front axle by means of a cardan shaft 7 or a corresponding pow er transmission member. At the front end of the tractor, a power take off shaft 12 is provided, by means of which the power can be transmitted from the engine crankshaft 4 to necessary equipment from the front end of the tractor. The differential gear 9 of the driving front axle, the clutch 8 of the four wheel drive, bx means of which the power can be connected from the cardan shaft 7 or from a corresponding power transmission member to the differential gear 9 , the clutch and power transmission devices 11, 12, 13 for their main parts, and the hydraulic steering pump 14 are fitted inside the oil sump 2 acting as the oil reservoir of the en gine 1 . The operations of the clutch 8 of the four wheel drive, of the differential lock 10 , and of the clutch 13 of the front power take off are arranged so as to be controlled by means of the return fluid B of the hydraulic control system. The devices fitted inside the oil sump are at least partly sup ported on the oil sump 2 , which is arranged so as to act as a carrying frame component of the tractor.
