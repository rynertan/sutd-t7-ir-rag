# AUTOMATIC CALIBRATION OF SENSOR CIRCUITS IN GEAR SHAPERS

## Abstract
A computer controlled apparatus for periodically calib rating the electrical outputs of pressure transducers TD1, TD2, TD3 to compensate for circuit induced errors and produce accurate outputs in real time. Reference signals V₁, V₂ are periodically input into various circuit elements to determine resultant outputs. The relationship thus deter mined between these known inputs and corresponding outputs is used to correct the output of the circuit elements during operation.
