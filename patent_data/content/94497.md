# Gas flow sensing apparatus.

## Abstract
A gas flow sensing apparatus comprises a filter 102 provided upstream the sensor 108 . The gas flow channel 104 between said filter and a sensing portion 106 of the apparatus changes from a large cross sectional area at the position of the filter to a small cross sectional area at the inlet of the sensing portion 106 therewith enhancing the flow velocity of the gas stream downstream of the filter 102 . The sensor 108 is exposed to an increased flow velocity and therefore delivers a larger output signal.
