# PROCESS FOR PRODUCING CEMENT MATERIAL FROM INDUSTRIAL PROCESSING AND URBAN SLURRIES

## Abstract
A process for preparing cement material from industrial processing and or urban slurries by admixing to the slurries at least one solid powder material of a cement nature and having hydraulic characteristics, and then granulated or pelletized un til a solid material is obtained which has a pH value in the 8 to 12 range, preferably no higher than 9, and a moisture content no higher than about 35 . The resulting material, depending on the type of start slurry and the additives used, is a solid granulate material which, by virtue of its composition and size characteristics, can be directly utilized as raw cement in the preparation of clinker, in the cement industry, or as a part sub stitute for raw cement and or as a coadjuvant in the cement in dustry.
