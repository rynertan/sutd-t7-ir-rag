# Reusable, heat sensitive material.

## Abstract
A thermally responsive transparent film comprising chromogenic material and colour developer material and on which film marks are developed in response to the applica tion of heat to form an image. These images can be erased by the action of certain liquids or vapours. The imaged and erased states are fixed under a range of environmental conditions. This film finds particular utility as a reusable projection transparency.
