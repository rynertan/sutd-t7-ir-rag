# A silver containing thick film conductor composition, a method for producing such a composition, a method of preparing a solar cell comprising screen printing said composition on an n type layer of a semiconductor wafer and the solar cells thus obtained.

## Abstract
Thick film conductor compositions containing silver powder and lead bismuthate glass frit powder and an organic vehicle solvent system are represented for use as grid metal lizations to the n type layers of n on p silicon solar cells. Said compositions are produced by dispersing silver powder and lead bismuthate glass frit powder in a vehicle and solvent mixture. Solar cells are prepared by screen printing the com position on an n type layer of a semiconductor wafer. The solar cells obtained according to said method are comprised too.
