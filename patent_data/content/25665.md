# A cooling system.

## Abstract
Air conditioning apparatus 3 has a compressor 6 , a condensor 7 , an evaporator 8 , an expansion valve 9 , a blower 10 and a pump 11 . Cooling water from outdoor cooling tower 4 is passed to the condensor 7 . Air circulating in computer room 1 passes evaporator 8 of the air conditioning apparatus 3 to be cooled. A cold water switching valve 12 is provided for diverting cooling water supplied by tower 4 from condensor 7 to a cold water coil 13 . When the outside temperature is low enough to give suffi ciently cold cooling water, valve 12 is operated to divert cool ing water from the condensor 7 to the cold water coil 13 , the compressor 6 is switched off and air circulating in the computer room 1 is cooled by cold water coil 13 , instead of evaporator 8 .
