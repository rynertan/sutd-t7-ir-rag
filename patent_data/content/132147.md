# Manufacture of insulated wires and cables.

## Abstract
A method of making insulated wires or cables in which a tube 6 of crystallisable polymeric material is first extruded over size on the wire 5 , cooled until it can be gripped at 8 and then reheated and stretched at 9 to produce crystalline orientation and to collapse it into contact with the wire is distinguished by first holding the tube at a temperature Tâ‚€ between its glass transition temperature and its crystalline melting point long enough for the degree of crystallinity to be significantly increased. Physical properties after orientation are considerably improved.
