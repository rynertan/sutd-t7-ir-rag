# Quick change electrical coupling.

## Abstract
A quick change coupling for a hostile environment which ensures alignment of electrical connectors carried therein, comprising male coupling component means 12 female coupling component means 14 including coupling body means 120 and coupling sleeve means 100 extending coax ially therefrom, said coupling sleeve means adapted to receive a portion of said male coupling component means therein seal means 76, 78 between said male coupling component means and said female coupling component means pin body means 200 associated with one of said coupling component means and having a plurality of electrical connector pins 208 extend ing longitudinally therefrom socket body means 90 associat ed with the other of said coupling component means and hav ing a plurality of electrical connector sockets therein adapted to engage said pins alignment means 162, 26 adapted to align said pins with said sockets and thread means 104, 70 adapted to secure said coupling components together.
