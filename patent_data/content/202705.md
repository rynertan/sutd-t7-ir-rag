# Patterned polyimide film, a photosensitive polyamide acid derivative and an electrophoretic image display cell.

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing a polyimide pattern which is provided with a metal layer, such that a dual layer system is exposed in accordance with a certain pattern, which pattern contains a photosensitive polyamide acid derivative and a positive photoresist which is developed, provided with a met al layer and removed, after which, the polyamide acid deriva tive layer is developed and imidisied, as well as a new photo sensitive polyamide acid derivative and an electrophoretic image display cell.
