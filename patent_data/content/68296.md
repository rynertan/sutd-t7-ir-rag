## Description
A new fungicidal composition, processes for its production and its use This invention relates to a new fungicidal tomposition, to processes for its production and to its use. Fungicides are used primarily for treatinfr crops and also for treating seeds, aetual plants and for decontaminating soil. For controlling fungal diseases, it is now essential to use chemical fungus control agents or fungicides. Numerous chemical substances have been used for controlling fungi. However, fungicides currently in use are still attended by some as yet unsolved problems. Thus, most fungicides are not sufficiently stable. They often have to be used in large quantities and, as a result, can beeome a source of toxic pollution to the environment. The adhesion of the fungicides to the plants or to the seeds or soil is not always satisfactory so that full activity cannot be developend.Accordingly, it would be desirable to have fuiigicides which adhere firmly to the specimens or are alpha to be protected, disintegrate readily and are effective even in very los concentrations. Another requirement Is ease of handling both during production and during application of the fungicides. It has now surprisingly been found that the quantity of fungicide per hectare of cultivated area required Tr fungus control can be reduced by up to 40 60 and, in some cases, by up to 80 providing the fungicidally active substance or the mixture of several fungicidally active substances is used in admixture with a phospholipide from the group comprising phosphatidyl choline, hydrogenated phosphatidyl cholines, phosphatidyl erhanolamine, N acyl phosphatidyl ethanolamines, phosphatidyl inositol, phosphatidyl serine and phosphatidy glycerol or with a mixture of several such phospholipides in a ratio by weight of from 1 0. to 1 20.In addition, the new mixtures show considerably better adhesion to the produce to be protected, particularly to leaves in the case of plants or, where they are used for disinfection, to the specimen or area to be disinfected. The improvement in adhesion also provides for uniform distribution of the fungicide over the specimens or area to be protected so that, despite a considerable reduction in the quantity of chemical fungicide used, excellent long lasting activity is obtained. In addition to an improvement in the economy of the treatment, this also results in less pollution of the environment and in a reduction in the waiting time following a fungicidal treatment.Finally, most of the phospholipides are natural and, in every case, non toxic products which, by virtue of their nature and their properties, do not themselves cause any pollution of the environment or have any adverse effect upon the waiting time. Some of the phospholipides are of course even used in foods. To produce the new fungicidal composition, the fungicide s is are mixed with the phospholipide or phospholipide mixture in a ratio by weight of from 1 0.2 to 1 20 and preferably in a ratio by weight of from 1 0.5 to l t0, but more preferably in a ratio by weight of from 1 1 to 1 5. In this connection, the weight of the phospholipide s is based on substantially pure phospholipide. Suitable phospholipides are, for example, the commercially available phosphatidyl cholines or phosphatidyl choline mixtures, such asPhospholiponR25 25 of phosphatidyl choline, 25k of phosphatidyl ethanolamine, 20 of phosphatidyl inositol PhospholiponR55 55 of phosphatidyl choline, 25 of phosphatidyl ethanolamine, 2 of phosphatidyl inositol PhospholiponR80 80 of phosphatidyl choline, 10 of phosphatidyl ethanolamine PhospholiponR100 96 of phosphatidyl choline PHospholiponR100H 96 of hydrogenated phosphatidyl choline PhosphoIiponR38 38 of phosphatidyl choline, 16k of N acetyl phosphatidyl ethanolamine, 4 of phosphatidyl ethanolamine .

The new fungicidal compositions may be produced in the following manner The phospholipide s is are dissolved in organic solvents, such as for example toluene, ethyl acetate, xylene, petrols, ethanol or methanol or mixtures of these solvents. The choice of the solvent bill depend upo the solubility of the particular fungicide used. The fungicide or the commercially available fungicide preparation is dissolved in the phospholipide solution, optionally by heating. On completion of dissolution, the solvent is removed in vacuo while heating. The product thus obtained is converted into a suitable standard commercial form optionally by the addition of suitable auxiliaries, such as for example fillers, vehicles, diluents, wetting agents, stabilisers, gelating agents, evaporation accelerators and extenders. The new fungicidal compositions may also be prepared by mixing the fungicide or the commercial fungicide product with the phospholipide or the phospholipides and any auxiliaries and fillers required, dissolving or suspending the resulting mixtures in an organic solvent and removing the solvent. The mixture obtained is ready for use. In the case of fungicides which are soluble in water or in water alcohol mixtures, the fungicide is with advantage first dissolved in water or a water alcohol mixture and the phospholipide or phospholipide mixtures are processed to form a solution or emulsion by stirring or by the application of ultrasonic waves.The emulsifiers normally required may be added before or after this stirring operation. The emulsions or solutions thus obtained are freed from the solvent mixture or water in the usual way, for example by distillation, spray drying or freeze drying. The resulting product may be used as such or optionally after the addition of suitable auxiliaries. The product may even be re emulsified or re dissolved in water and used as a spray. Vehicles are, for example, talcum, kaolin, bentonite, kieselguhr, lime or crsed roc. Other auxiliaries are, or example, suriace aetive compounds, such as saps fatty acid salts , fatty alcohol sulfonates or alh l sulfonates. Gelatin, casein, albumin, starch or methyl cellulose may be used as stabilisers or protective colloids. The nelf fungicidal compositions may be used in liquid or solid form, for example as dusting powders, granulates, sprays, aerosols, solutions or emulsions, as leaf fungicides, disinfectants or soil fungicides.EXAMPLE 1Preparation of 1 kg of a spraying powder 20 containing captan as its active ingredient 200 g of captan, 200 kg of Phospholipon 55 in 50 ml of ethanol and 10 g of DONSS dioctyl sodium sulfosuceinate are dissolved in 3 litres of toluene.400 ml of the resulting solution are kneaded with 600 g of bentonite and the paste obtained is dried in vacuo.
