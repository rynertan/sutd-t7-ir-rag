# AVALANCHE FUSE ELEMENT AS PROGRAMMABLE MEMORY

## Abstract
A programmable device is provided by a thin oxide avalanche fuse element 40 which is programmed at a voltage below the oxide 44 breakdown level. This device may be used to fix the addresses of faulty rows or columns in a memory having redundant or substitute cells, or as a programmable memory of the PROM type. Upon break down, the thin oxide 44 is perforated by small holes which fill with silicon to create short circuit. In one embodiment, the source or emitter 41 of the transistor device may be separated from the drain 42 and gate 43 by thick field oxide 20 .
