# AN INTEGRATED FIELD CONTROLLED THYRISTOR STRUCTURE WITH GROUNDED CATHODE

## Abstract
A thyristor, suitable for electrical switching in automotve applications, having two gates, one 42 for turn on and one 44 for turn off, without requiring change of anode or cathode potentials, comprises a semiconductor body 24 having successive contiguous P, N, P, N type regions 30, 28, 24 ,22 , and a portion 24b of the second P type region 24 having a surrounding N type region 26 producing a current flow pinch effect.
