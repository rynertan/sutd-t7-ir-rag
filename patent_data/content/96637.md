# Programmable output buffer.

## Abstract
A structure and method are provided wherein a single output buffer stage 50 is provided which can be program med to function either as an open drain output buffer or a CMOS Push Pull output buffer. The output buffer stage constructed in accordance with this invention is program med in one of several manners. In one embodiment of this invention, the fabrication steps utilized to program the output buffer are the enhancement and depletion dopings, whereby certain devices of the output buffer are program med to either remain always turned off or always turned on, thus programming the output buffer to serve either as an open drain output buffer or as a CMOS push pull output buffer.
