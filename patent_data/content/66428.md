# MODULAR DYE LASER

## Abstract
A dye laser is described that has an optical resonator structure which is modular in construction. The resonator includes a first base plate 12 that has all of the optical elements typically found in a basic linear dye laser. A second base plate 42 is rigidly securable to the first base plate to extend the resonator structure for either ring operation or for more differing linear dye laser configurations. The second base plate can include those optical elements required to cooperate with the optical elements on the first base plate to provide ring operation. Additional and differing modular units can be provided and secured to the two base plates making up the optical resonator structure to satisfy many different criteria. Moreover, a third base plate 114 is rigidly securable between the first two base plates to further extend the resonator structure as desired.
