# Method for forming recessed dielectric isolation.

## Abstract
A method is described for forming the recessed dielec tric isolation in a silicon substrate. This method involves first forming trenches 16 which are less than 1 micron in depth in areas of one principal surface of the silicon substrate where isolation is desired. Where, for example, an NPN bipolar transistor structure is planned to be formed it is usually necessary to have a P region 6 underneath the recessed dielectric isolation to allow full isolation between the various bipolar transistor devices. A PNP transistor uses an N region underneath the isolation. Where a field effect transistor is planned a channel stop 30 can be substituted for the P region. Under the circumstance of bipolar devices, the P region 6 is formed in the substrate 2 prior to the deposition of an epitaxial layer 8 thereover. The trench formation is caused to be formed through the epitaxial layer and into the P regions therein. The surface of the trenches 16 are then oxidized in an oxidizing ambient to form a silicon dioxide layer 18 thereon. A glass 20 is deposited over this principal surface. The glass used has a thermal coefficient of expansion that approximates that of silicon and has a softening temperature of less than 1200 C. The structure is then heated to a temperature that allows the flow of the deposited glass on the surface so as to fill the trenches. The glass on the principal surface above the trench can be removed by a reactive ion etching method. Alternatively and preferably, the glass is removed from areas other than the immediate area of the trench by lithography and etching techniques followed by a second heating of the structure to cause the glass flow to result in surface planarization.
