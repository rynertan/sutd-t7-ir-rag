## Description
This invention relates to a magnetically responsive particulate reagent carrier and to its preparation. The carrier particles can be coupled to or otherwise associated with reactive groups, such as enzymes, haptens or antibodies, and used as carriers for analytical reagents, for example in performing assays. Magnetically responsive or attractable particles have been produced by several methods which incorporate magnetite, ferrite, chromium oxide or nickel powders into matrices to which reagents can subsequently be coupled. In one such method, a magnetically responsive powder is suspended in a solution of a polymer which is then gelled or precipitated to form a solid mass. The solid so obtained is ground or milled to obtain an insoluble powder in which ferromagnetic granules are immobilized. Examples are described in Robinson et al, Another method involves the deposition of polymeric coatings on ferromagnetic powders by coacervation for example, by the deposition and subsequent cross linking of albumin onto barium ferrite or magnetite. Examples are given in Ithakissios, et al, The traditional methods for producing such particles have relied on the use of ferromagnetic powders. The particles generally exceed the critical size of a magnetic domain and, therefore, possess a substantial magnetic remanence. Remanence is the magnetic induction that remains in a material after removal of the magnetizing force. It is this property which causes such particles to remain aggregated, even in suspensions, after a magnetic field, to which they have been exposed, is removed. Such particles are often spontaneously aggregated by the ambient terrestrial magnetic field. Hence, these particles are unsuited for use in automated assay systems which measure reaction rates, rather than end points, since such measurements require the periodic resuspension and redispersion of the particles. To avoid problems associated with magnetic remanence, several methods have been developed which use superparamagnetic, rather than ferromagnetic, materials for the particles. Superparamagnetic materials, such as ferrofluids , exhibit a very high magnetization at saturation over 10 ⁴T 600 Gauss and show no magnetic remanence in the absence of an external magnetic field. Examples of the production of such materials include the microencapsulation of oil based ferrofluids see Kakimi et al, US A 4342739 and the polymerization of aldehydes in the presence of aqueous ferrofluids Rembaum et al, Another method of making superparamagnetic particles entraps colloidal magnetite a water based ferrofluid into or onto gel particles by prolonged contact with Sepharose trade mark beads. However, these particles leak iron oxide which prevents them from being useful in optical density or absorption measurements see Griffin Mosbach, Another method of making superparamagnetic particles has been described in US A 4297337. It provides a diluted array of superparamagnetic crystals in a glassy matrix. However, these particles must be kept extremely small, e.g. less than one micron in diameter, to prevent their high specific gravity causing rapid sedimentation. The magnetic force on such small particles is very weak and, therefore, the fast magnetic response necessary for automated analytical systems cannot be achieved. Thus, in summary, although magnetically responsive carries particles have been prepared and used as reagent carries in immunoassay procedures, each has possessed certain undesirable characteristics. We have now devised a superparamagnetic particulate reagent carrier material which is very useful in automated analysers, has excellent stability and very low magnetic remanence. According to the present invention, there is provided a stable superparamagnetic reagent carrier material which is in the form of substantially spherical hydrated particles of a diameter from 0.5 to 500 µm, the particles comprising a matrix of a polymeric material hydrated by an aqueous medium, and a magnetically responsive substance having a diameter of from 5nm to 500nm, and being colloidally stably dispersed within said matrix and entrapped therein, said substance being essentially free in said hydrated particles to rotate within said matrix under the influence of a magnetic field and thermal motion resulting in a high magnetic permeability and low magnetic remanence. The invention also includes a process for preparing such a material which comprises a incorporating by passive transport iron compounds into water insoluble water swellable substantially spherical particles of a polymeric matrix b converting the iron compounds so incorporated to insoluble iron oxides having a diameter of from 5nm to 500nm whereby a colloidally and stably dispersed magnetically responsive moiety is generated in situ within said polymeric matrix, said entrapped iron oxide being essentially free to rotate within said matrix under the influence of a magnetic field and thermal motion and c washing the polymeric matrix to remove soluble by products, the hydrated particles so formed having a diameter of from 0.5 to 500µm. The magnetically responsive carrier particles of the present invention are useful particularly, but not exclusively, in automated, non isotopic immunoassays. Their spherical shape and preferred smooth surface permit them to be pumped through long, narrow conduits, such as in continuous flow analyzers, without clogging. The particles can be caused to migrate freely in a liquid medium or to be immobilized by means of an inhomogeneous magnetic field. For example, when drawing them to the side or bottom of an optical cuvette, a clear supernatant is rapidly obtained for photometric analysis. In the absence of such a magnetic field, the particles are easy to disaggregate and disperse into suspension in the liquid medium, as they exhibit extremely low magnetic remanence. The ease of repeated magnetic sedimentation and resuspension allows for reaction rates, rather than just end points to be determined. Their small size and low relative specific gravity provide a very slow sedimentation rate. This, combined with their excellent chemical and physical stability, allows assay reactions to continue over an extended time period. The particulate reagent carrier of the invention comprises particles or beads each formed of a water insoluble matrix, e.g. a gel, swollen i.e. hydrated in an aqueous solution, and having colloidally dispersed therein superparamagnetic granules. Each hydrated particle has a diameter of 0.5 to 100 µm and preferably has a smooth, substantially spherical surface having an axial ratio lower than 4 1. Preferably, the superparamagnetic granules, e.g. iron oxides, are present in sufficient quantity to impart a specific gravity of between 1.2 and 2.7 to said hydrated particles. In the process of the invention, the particles are prepared by passive transport incorporation of iron compounds into substantially spherical, water swellable crosslinked polymeric matrices. The iron compounds so incorporated are then converted in situ to their respective iron oxides. The iron oxides remain colloidally dispersed within the polymeric matrices and impart superparamagnetic properties to the resulting hydrated particles. The term colloidal as used herein means a size range of 5 to 500 nm. Particles in this size range are generally unstable unless stabilized by electrostatic forces or by steric hindrance. In the present invention, steric hindrance is provided by the polymeric matrix surrounding the magnetic substance. The term magnetically responsive as used herein refers to the capacity of the particles to migrate, relative to their surroundings, under the influence of an external inhomogeneous magnetic field. The reagent carrier particles of the invention comprise a polymeric matrix, in which the magnetic substance is incorporated, the matrix being water insoluble but swollen by an aqueous medium. In its swollen state, the matrix is permeable to soluble iron compounds, such as iron salts, or soluble compounds of nickel and chromium. In an aqueous medium close to neutral pH and at room temperature, the matrix is chemically and mechanically stable indefinitely. The matrix can tolerate extremes such as strong acids or bases for times sufficient to complete the fabrication process and also is resistant to boiling water for hours. The particles formed of the matrix are substantially spherical, preferably having an axial ratio less than 4 1, and preferably also having a smooth, non ragged surface. They have a diameter of 0.5 to 500 µm, preferably 5 to 50 µm. The surface of the particle has functional groups which can be activated for coupling chemistry, to attach antibodies, antigens, haptens, enzymes and other reagents to the particle. Two parameters which have been found to be particularly important are the crosslink density of the matrix material, e.g. a gel, and the diameter of the particles. The proper choice of both determines to a large extent the performance of the overall particle. First, the crosslink density, or the water regain, of the matrix material determines the amount of iron compounds that can be incorporated during particle preparation. The larger the water regain, because of lower crosslink density, the more iron compound is incorporated per particle. However, too weakly crosslinked matrices have inherent disadvantages. Due to the large pores , large molecules present in the milieu can diffuse into the matrix, which may result in interferences, e.g. non specific binding, when the matrix is used as a reagent carrier in an immunoassay. Also, such matrices, when swollen, are inherently soft and mechanically weak, easily deformed and or abraded. During further processing, the temporarily harsh conditions of very low and high pH may cause breakage of some crosslinks, which in weakly crosslinked matrices may cause significant changes in the properties of the particles. For highly crosslinked materials, this change is insignificant. Matrix materials which show an initial water regain of 5 to 20 ml g are particularly well suited as reagent carriers. Matrix materials of lower regain can also be used, but multiple loading of the magnetic material may be necessary, as described below. The size of the particles is also important for satisfactory performance. The hydrodynamic drag on a sphere increases as the square of its diameter, while the magnetic pull, and also the gravitational force, acting on it increases as the cube of its diameter. Therefore, for fast migration within the surrounding liquid or reaction mixture, a large particle is desirable. On the other hand, to optimize the total binding surface available to couple reagents, small sized particles are desired. Accordingly, to obtain particles which exhibit sufficient high mobility and sufficient surface area, and thus balance these requirements, particles should preferably have a diameter of from 3 to 60 µm, most preferably 20 to 40 µm, usually designated by the wetmesh size of 400. Regarding the composition of the matrix material, several crosslinked hydrophilic polymers have been evaluated. Some were found to have suitable properties, as described, while others did not and were useless as reagent carriers. An example of a useful material is crosslinked polyacrylamide gel, such as Biogel BioRad Laboratories, Richmond, CA , in which the iron oxides formed predominantly inside the gel matrix and only insignificant amounts formed on the surface or between the particles. In contrast, the crosslinked polysaccharide known as Sephadex Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Piscataway, NJ for no obvious reason appears to exclude iron salts, i.e. when attempting to prepare particles as described below, the iron hydroxide and or iron oxide predominantly form on the surface of the gel particles. Biogel and Sephadex are trade marks. In the process of the invention, iron compounds are incorporated by passive transport along with water into spherical swellable, crosslinked polymeric matrices. The iron compounds are then converted in situ into their respective iron oxides, and the iron oxides remain colloidally dispersed within the polymeric matrix. We use the term swellable herein to mean the property of the matrix material to absorb a fluid medium, usually aqueous, with or without an accompanying increase in volume. In the process, dry gel particles are contacted with a solution or iron salts to cause the gel to swell and to introduce by passive transport the iron ions into the interior of the particles. Although it is not a necessary condition, the preferred solvent is water. Anhydrous iron chlorides as well as some non ionic compounds, e.g. iron carbonyl, are also soluble in organic solvents and such solutions can in principle be used to load the particles. A variety of iron salts can be used as long as a concentrated solution can be prepared. Again, for reasons of convenience, the chlorides FeCl₂ and FeCl₃ are preferred. The ratio of the ferrous to ferric salts is important. While the particles prepared with ferric ions alone show negligible magnetic properties, ferrous salts yield a product of considerable magnetic susceptibility. A ratio of ferric to ferrous of 2 1 yields a mixed oxide of the composition of magnetite Fe₃O₄. Ratios within the range of 2 1 to 1 2 all yield magnetically responsive products. Because of oxidation by air during processing, it is advantageous to use more ferrous salts than required by theory. Ferric chloride in water and at room temperature undergoes rapid partial hydrolysis leading to super polycations which have increased size and also high positive charges. Both effects can cause reduced permeation of the salts into the polymeric network after short initial permeation. Consequently, uneven iron penetration is observed. Therefore, it is advantageous to suppress the formation of such less diffusing species by the addition of salts which stabilize aqueous solutions of ferric ions. While a concentrated 1.6 molar solution of FeCl₃ turns turbid in a few hours, addition of sodium sulfite in less than 0.2 molar ratio causes the solution to stay clear, albeit deep brown red. The loading of the gel particles with iron salts in the presence of bisulfite yields an even and uniform product. Subsequently, in the preparation of the particles, this bisulfite is washed out. Contacting of the mixed salt solution with the dry gel particles is done such that no intersticial liquid remains by the time the particles have swollen to their full capacity. The end point of swelling is easily detected by the observation of a sparkling yellow appearance not unlike a projection screen. The next step in the preparation is the conversion of the iron salts to their respective iron hydroxides within the particles. To this end, the pH is raised to over 7 by submerging the gel particles in an alkaline medium. In principle, NaOH, Na₂CO₃, gaseous ammonia or other bases can be used, but the preferred one is a chilled dilute 3 ammonia solution. The ammonia is volatile and, therefore, its excess can easily be boiled off later in the preparation. After prolonged stirring, the supernatant is decanted and discarded. The particles are then washed with copious amounts of water and allowed to equilibrate, at each washing, for at least 30 minutes, until the final supernatant shows no alkalinity, e.g. has a pH of 7.6 or less. In the next step, the mixed iron hydroxides incorporated and trapped in the gel particles are converted to oxides by heat treatment. The dark brown particles are resuspended in de ionized water and boiled for an hour. It is during this period that the magnetic response develops, owing to dehydration of iron hydroxide within the polymer network to form iron oxide, predominantly Fe₃O₄. After this dehydration, the gel particles are thoroughly washed to remove all soluble materials. It can be observed through the microscope that very small amounts of iron oxide cling to the surface of the gel particles which can be removed in an ultrasonic field. Therefore, the gel particles are transferred onto a nylon mesh of about 20 µm openings. By gently raising and lowering this sieve in an ultrasonic bath filled with de ionized water, the exomagnetite shakes loose and falls through the screen. After several minutes of sonication, particles are harvested which have a smooth shiny surface and are very responsive to an inhomogeneous magnetic field. An alternative method of iron oxide precipitation uses an organic base. In this procedure, the saturated swollen gel particles are washed on a glass filter with 5 dimethylformamide DMF in acetone to remove the small amounts of iron solution wetting the surface of the gel. After a short period of air drying, the organic base 4 amino methyl piperidine is added in aqueous solution to precipitate the iron oxides inside the particles. This method leads to particles which do not have any visible iron oxides on their surface and therefore do not need subsequent purifications by ultrasonic treatment. The clean particles are then air dried or kept as a slurry in a stoppered flask. The magnetic response of the beads can be measured simply by weighing them in a standardized vial which can be placed on top of a strong permanent magnet. The difference in weight with and without the magnet in place is designated as pull and is compared with the pull observed with the same volume of finely ground magnetite or barium ferrite powder. Using the procedures described above, particles can easily be made which have a measured pull of at least 0.4 times that of barium ferrite and 0.20 times that of precipitated magnetite powder Fisons Ltd., Leics. U.K. . Magnetic carrier particles with this kind of susceptibility are able to exhibit a migration rate of over 5 mm second under the influence of a strong magnetic force in a medium of 0.001 Pa s one centipoise viscosity. If an even higher magnetic mobility is desired, there are two techniques available to accomplish this. The first, termed multiple loading , increases the magnetic force acting on each particle. The second, termed roasting , decreases the hydrodynamic drag acting on the particles. Although the particles tend to become aggregated by the magnetic field, and aggregates move faster in the inhomogeneous magnetic field than do the individual particles, both techniques increase the rate at which the particles can be magnetically moved in the surrounding solution. The magnetic properties of the particles, prepared as described above, can be enhanced by multiple loading with iron salts. For example, the particles, formed as described above, may be finally dehydrated by acetone followed by air drying or drying in a stream of nitrogen. These dry particles can be subjected again, one or more times, to the complete process, as described. The resulting magnetic susceptibility of the final particles is considerably higher and more so for a triple loaded material. In this process of multiple loading, the diameter of the particle is kept constant same hydrodynamic drag but the magnetic response of each particle is increased by virtue of its increased iron oxide content. After multiple loading, the iron oxide may constitute 50 or more by weight of the particle. Another method, referred to as roasting , increases the magnetic hydrodynamic mobility by decreasing the hydrodynamic drag at constant force acting on the particle. This is accomplished by introducing added crosslinks into the gel in the weakly swollen or unswollen state. For example, polyacrylamide eliminates ammonia on heating above 200 C to form imides. Both interchain and intrachain eliminations are possible to diacrylimide bridges and or to glutarimides, respectively , both tending to reduce the swelling capacity of the polymer. Intrachain elimination reduces the hydrophilicity and flexibility of the chains. Interchain elimination reduces the volume to which the gel particle expands on swelling. The result is a particle which is more mobile in a magnetic field than its precursor, because of reduced drag as a consequence of smaller diameter. If roasting is performed on particles not previously polished by sonication, the reaction causes fusion of the external iron oxide to the surface of the particles. The so generated oxide rich surface can then be used for the chemical activation of the particles for coupling. Reference is made to Example III, hereafter. The particles of the invention can be associated with a variety of reactive groups to provide a reagent particularly, but not exclusively, useful in automated non isotopic immunoassays. These particles carry reactive sites predominantly on their surface and can be caused either to migrate or to be immobilized at will by means of an inhomogeneous magnetic field. In the absence of such a magnetic field, these particles are easy to disperse and to resuspend in a surrounding medium because of their very low magnetic remanence and, by virtue of their small size and low relative specific gravity, their sedimentation rate is low. While magnetically responsive reagent carriers are known in the art, none have exhibited features comparable with those of the particles of this invention, so as to be particularly useful in automated immunoassays. Because the particles have a spherical and preferably smooth surface, they can be pumped through long narrow tubes, e.g. having internal diameters of less than 1 mm, without clogging, as are required in continuous flow analyzers such as disclosed in U.S. A 4141687. These particles, While a variety of reactive groups can be coupled to the surface of said particles, the primary interest lies in either catalytic moieties e.g. enzymes or immunologically active ligands such as antibodies, antigens or haptens. The particles, when coupled to haptens, can be used advantageously in a one step extraction of specific antibodies from a suspension, e.g. ascites fluids, by stirring them into the suspension and then drawing them out by an inhomogeneous magnetic field. This simple operation replaces, therefore, centrifugation or filtration followed by affinity chromatography. The particles can also be advantageously used to recover specific chemicals e.g. valuable or toxic ions from suspensions containing other particulate solids, which precludes chromatographic separation. Any such chemicals can be recovered by coupling ligands to the particles of this invention which complex with these specific chemicals. Once complexed, these specific chemicals can be magnetically separated and retrieved. The following working examples are given by way of illustration and describe experiments which were performed in developing the present invention. Standard commercially available reagent grade chemicals were used wherever possible. This Example presents a step by step preparation of magnetically responsive particles in accordance with the invention, the particles being particularly useful for automated immunoassays. A solution of 43.5 g of FeCl₂.5 H₂O, 30.0 g of FeCl₃.6 H₂O and 4.5 g of Na₂S₂O₅ was prepared in 57 of de ionized water. This solution was reddish brown and limpid density 1.39 , and contained about 37 solids Fe² Fe³ 2 1. A 90 ml portion of this solution was added to 60 g of dry spherical polyacrylamide particles Bio Gel P 4 Extra Fine, BioRad, The swollen particles so prepared were added to 900 ml of a 3 ammonium hydroxide solution chilled to below 5 C in a large glass beaker and continually stirred. Ice was added to maintain the temperature around 5 C. After 30 minutes, the supernatant was decanted. The particles, which had turned dark greenish brown, were washed six times with de ionized water, allowing each time about 30 minutes for equilibration, to remove the excess ammonia and ammonium chloride. After washing, the solids were suspended in 1.5 liters of de ionized water and the suspension was brought to a boil with frequent stirring. Boiling was maintained for 60 minutes. The brown color of the particles gradually turned to black. The magnetic properties had now developed, as could be seen by placing a strong magnet to the wall of the beaker. After boiling, the particles were washed again with water at room temperature to remove all soluble material. Decantation was facilitated by the magnetic properties of the particles. After several washes, the boiling cycle and wash cycle were repeated and the particles were dispensed into a glass cylinder closed off at its bottom by a nylon screen of 20 µm openings Nytex 3 . The cylinder was lowered into an ultrasonic bath containing de ionized water and, while sonicating, the cylinder was slowly raised and lowered, causing the water to pass in and out of the glass cylinder through the screen. Loose iron oxide which formed in small amounts a few percent of total on the surface of the particles fell through the screen and was visible by its dark color. Microscopic examination showed that the originally dull surfaced brown particles had become shiny, uniformly brown and transparent. The final particles were air dried and weighed. The increase of weight, due to colloidal iron oxide trapped in the gel matrix, amounted to 25 of the original dry particle, or approximately 20 of the final particle. The magnetic susceptibility was determined by measuring the weight increase of a standard volume of the particles in a strong inhomogeneous magnetic field. Compared with pure precipitated magnetic iron oxide Fison s Ltd., supra , the carrier was 0.25 times as susceptible. Fully water swollen particles had a specific gravity of about 1.35. For even higher magnetic susceptibility, the whole process was repeated several times. It was possible to increase the magnetic force by a factor of 2.8 by doubly loading and by 3.8 by triply loading the particles. The multiple loaded particles have a considerably higher specific gravity which manifests itself in a higher sedimentation rate. This Example illustrates a method of eliminating the formation of magnetic iron oxides on the particle surface. This is accomplished by washing traces of the iron salts from the surface of the particles, prior to treatment with base, with a solvent which does not extract the iron salts from the interior of the swollen particle. A stock solution of iron salts was prepared from 400 g FeCl₃.6 H₂O, 200 g FeCl₂.4 H₂O and 600 ml distilled water. An 80 ml portion of this solution was added to 10 g polyacrylamide particles P 4, 400 mesh from BioRad, The carrier particles of Examples I and II exhibited no physical or chemical degradation over extended periods, i.e. greater than six months. The mobility in a surrounding liquid medium of the particles of the invention can be increased by reducing their diameter while maintaining their iron content. This Example demonstrates a method for introducing additional crosslinking in the gel particle in the unswollen state. A 20 g portion of gel particles, prepared as described in Example II, was introduced into a 500 ml flask, to which 20 glass beads, 6 mm in diameter, were added. The flask was mounted on a rotary evaporator with the condenser removed and immersed in a silicon oil bath heated to above 250 C for 2 hours, while maintaining slow rotation. The glass beads prevented the gel particles from clumping or aggregating. Ammonia evolved, indicating the formation of additional crosslinks in the gel particles. The resulting particles do not swell appreciably in aqueous solution. Their magnetic response under water, on a volumetric basis, is up to 4 times greater than the same particles which were not so treated. This Example demonstrates that the particles of the present invention exhibit a relatively high magnetic permeability with very low magnetic remanence. The gel particles, prepared by Example I, were placed in a cylindrical tube. The tube was placed in a magnetic field of 3000 ampere turns and the resulting magnetic induction was measured with a Bell gaussmeter. The field applied was not strong enough to cause saturation. When the generating current of the solenoid was shut off, the magnetic remanence was measured on the gaussmeter. The following table shows that the ratio of the remanent flux density remanence to the permeability at 3000 ampere turn field is negligible in the case of the particles of this invention compared with the other particles tested. The comparison of the disclosed particles, when dry and when swollen, shows that the colloidal magnetite generated therein is essentially free to rotate when the gel is swollen, while partially hindered from rotation when the gel is dried. This Example demonstrates the immobilization of an enzyme on the surface of the particles of this invention in such a way that its enzymatic activity is maintained In a 50 ml flask, 1.5 grams of air dried, triply loaded gel particles were dispersed in 25 ml toluene containing 10 ml of acetone. Also, 30 mg of polyethylenimine Dow P1000 was added as a 2 solution in toluene. The 50ml flask containing the suspension was slowly rotated and gradually heated to 70 C. A gentle stream of nitrogen was used to gradually remove the acetone. As the polarity of the solvent diminishes, the polyethylenimine PEI adsorbs to the surface of the particles. The so deposited PEI was then crosslinked with 3 mg of ethylenebromide at 65 C in two hours. The particles were then filtered off, washed with acetone and dried in a stream of nitrogen. The activation of the surface was accomplished by treating 200 mg of the PEI coated particles with a reagent consisting of 2 ml phosphate buffer pH 7.4 and 0.1 ml of 0.5g glutaraldehyde in 5 ml isopropyl alcohol Baker reagent grade . After shaking the suspension for 45 minutes at room temperature, the supernatant was discarded and the particles washed twice with 1 ml each of phosphate buffer. Coupling of beta galactosidase to the activated particles was accomplished by dissolving 20 mg of the enzyme Sigma G5635 750 U mg in 0.5 ml of the same buffer and shaking the solution with the activated particles at 2 C for 3 1 2 hours before storing for 18 hours at 2 C. The particles were then washed with copious amounts of cold buffer, until no enzymatic activity could be detected in the supernatant. The washed enzymatically active, magnetically responsive particles were stored in the same buffer at 4 C. To determine if the coupled enzyme had maintained its activity, 2 mg particles were introduced into an optical cuvette having an optical path length of 7 mm and 250 µl of a substrate ortho nitro phenyl galactoside, 600 mg l in pH 7.5 phosphate buffer were added. The particles were resuspended by shaking between successive readings. Prior to each reading of optical density at 420 nm wavelength, the reagent particles were drawn to the bottom of the cuvette by a permanent magnet. Readings were taken every 24 seconds. The color of ortho nitrophenol developed rapidly. The initial rate of color development was greater than 300 mA min. In the absence of reagent particles, no such colour developed. This Example demonstrates the immobilization of an antibody on the surfaces of particles of this invention. A suspension of 170 mg of particles, as described in Example III, in 20 ml toluene was prepared and silanized with 5 ml glycidoxypropyltrimethoxy silane Aldrich Chem. Co. 23,578 4 by refluxing overnight. The particles were then washed with toluene and subsequently with acetone and dried. The activated particles were shaken for 3 days at room temperature with 10 ml of a solution of 400 µl of a precipitated IgG fraction containing 35 mg ml of goat anti rabbit antibody Antibodies, Inc. , in phosphate buffer pH 8.0. The preparation was then washed three times with 10 ml each of the same buffer and subsequently reacted with 0.1 aqueous ethanolamine for 4 hours at room temperature for deactivation of unreacted epoxy groups on the particles. The particles were then washed three times with 10 ml portions of the same buffer and subjected to a thyroxine T₄ assay protocol. In this assay, 50 µl of a suspension 25 mg ml of the particles were incubated with 20 µl of sample serum , 50 µl of T₄ conjugate T₄ beta galactosidase and 50 µl of first antibody anti T₄ rabbit antiserum for 15 minutes at 37 C in an optical cuvette. The magnetic reagent was magnetically sedimented and the supernatant discarded. The wash cycle was repeated once again using 1 ml of buffer. The particles were then suspended in the enzyme substrate of 500 µl of an orthonitrophenyl galactoside and, after 10 minutes at 37 C, 500 µl of molar sodium carbonate were added. The suspended particles were magnetically sedimented to the bottom of the cuvette and the absorption of the supernatant was measured at 420 nm wavelength. The amount of T₄ beta galactosidase bound to the particles was calculated and compared with a commercial product of similar configuration. Such commercial product was a cellulose based solid phase sold by us under Part No. T01 1059. The fraction of the enzyme bound to the solid phase was comparable for both, i.e. between 34 and 35 . However, the non specific binding NSB as determined in the absence of the first antibody was only a fraction of that found with the commercial product.
