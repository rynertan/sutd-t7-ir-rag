# Energy beam focusing apparatus and method.

## Abstract
Apparatus and method for increasing the power density of an energy beam e.g. a laser beam by focusing an incident beam to an anisometric configuration and thereafter focusing the anisometric beam to a modified, perferably isometric, configuration. A serrulate reflective surface facili tates the splitting of an incident beam into a plurality of high energy reflected beams, and the technique is of utility in perforating webs, such as polyolefin films.
