# Fluidised bed filtering and or heat exchange apparatus particularly for gaseous discharges from internal combustion engines and industrial plants.

## Abstract
A fluidised bed filtering and heat exchange apparatus particularly for treating gaseous discharges from internal combustion engines and industrial plants comprises a vertical axis elongated casing 10 having a filler of inert, particulate material therein, a gas feed manifold 36 provided with discharge nozzles arranged to direct gas downwardly into said casing 10 to maintain said filler in a fluidside state, and a cyclone 58 communicating with the upper part of said casing 10 to receive said gas therefrom and to separate agglomerated particles from said gas. Heat exchange means are provided for cooling the fluidised filler including a plurality of tubes 46 for carrying a heat exchange fluid therethrough.
