# Reactive ion etching method.

## Abstract
A reactive ion etching method utilizing high frequency power wherein cathode drop voltage developed in the vicinity of an electrode disposed for impressing a high frequency power is gradually reduced immediately before stopping the impression of high frequency power at the end of ion etching process, thereby reducing the voltage im pressed on an insulation layer within a semiconductor wafer below the breakdown voltage of the insulation layer.
