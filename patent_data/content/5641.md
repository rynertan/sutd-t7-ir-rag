# Method and apparatus for monitoring and controlling sputter deposition processes.

## Abstract
A system is provided for monitoring sputtering deposition parameters and, through closed loop control, achieving rapid modification of the parameters to maintain or to obtain a desired film composition. In reactive sputtering, the sputtering chamber 10 has individual gas pressure controllers 18, 19 for the various gases to be added to the chamber. A holder for a substrate 13 on which the film is to be deposited includes a heater with adjustable control 15 . A differentially pumped quadrupole mass analyzer 23 interconnects with the chamber 10 to receive a sample of plasma ions, measures the ionized species existing in the plasma and generates signals related to the composition of the deposited film. A controller 24 responsive to the quadrupole analyzer actuation and under control of a central processor 25 adjusts the pressure of the one or more reactive or non reactive gases being provided to the chamber, and or controls other deposition parameters, such as substrate temperature or other plasma features.
