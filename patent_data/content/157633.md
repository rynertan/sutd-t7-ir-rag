A vehicle 1 comprises first and second bodies 2, 3 con nected together, each body having three legs 5, 5 and the bodies are movable separately. There is a third body 4 con nected to the first body 2 on a spindle 10 for relative pivotal movement and connected to the second body 3 for sliding movement. The legs are articulated at joints 7 and 8 and are ad justable in length. Each leg has a foot 9 which is replaceable. The vehicle undergoes movement or walking and the combina tion of sliding and pivoting allows changes in direction to be quickly and easily accomplished.
