# Method and device for measuring the quantity of water dampening the face of an offset printing plate.

## Abstract
A method and device for measuring the quantity of water dampening the face of an offset printing plate in which a light beam is made incident at a suitable angle to the face of the printing plate and the light beam directly reflected from the plate at the same angle with the angle of incidence as well as the light beam diffuse reflected in the direction normal to the face of the printing plate are independently detected so that a printing pattern portion and a non printing pattern portion on the face of the plate are detected in response to the diffuse reflected light beam and the variations in level of the directly reflected light beam is calibrated in response to the diffuse ref lected light beam. In order to eliminate the adverse effects caused by the difference in characteristics of light sensors for receiving the directly reflected light beam and the diffuse reflected light beam, respectively, the outputs of the light sensors for receiv ing the directly reflected light beam and the diffuse reflected light beam when the face of the printing plate is sufficiently dampened with water as well as the outputs thereof when the face of the printing plate is completely dried are previously measured so that the calibration of the result of measurement can be calibrated by using the above described two outputs.
