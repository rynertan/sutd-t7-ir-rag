## Description
IMPROVED SASH BOLT FOR THE CLOSURE OF SHUTTERS SUCH ASGRILLES, LOUVRES AND THE LIKE . For locking in the closure position shutters such as grilles, louvred shutters and the like having two shutter leaves which can be drawn together, there are utilised mechanisms, the so called spagnolettes, which are in general constituted by a vertical rod mounted rotatably on one shutter leaf and provided with upper and lower end hooks intended to engage with fixed abutment pins, and an operating handle with which the vertical rod is turned to engage or disengage the hooks with the fixed pins and correspondingly lock or unlock the shutter. In the known structures, when the shutter is locked in the closure position, the handle is inserted and fixed in a locking hook, following its angular displacement about an axis substantially perpendicular to the length of the rod.This type of structure has the disadvantage that the handle can be operated relatively easily from the outside through the slats of the shutter, which encourages attempts at burglary of or through the shutter itself. The object of the present invention is that of eliminating the previously lamented disadvantages by providing a shutter bolt for the closure of shutters such as grilles, louvred shutters etc., having a handle and an improved locking device for said handle, for the purpose of rendering the mechanism more efficient and not operable from the outside to safeguard the closure of the lock.Advantageously all the elements of the mechanism can be made from brass to be easily assembled and remain unaltered with time.Moreover, the handle and the improved locking device are adaptable and usable also for locking shutters having a single shutter leaf.The object described above is achieved by an improved sash bolt for the closure of shutters such as grilles, louvred shutters and the like, comprising a vertical rod rotatably supported on one leaf of the shutter and provided with end hooks engageable with fixed abutment pins, there being moreover provided a handle, rotatably associated with a median portion of the said rod and releasably engageable with a locking device fixed on the other leaf of the shutter or to the fixed structure, characterised by the fact that the said locking device defines a movable housing seat for at least a portion of the handle, there being moreover provided a movable stop element, supported by the said locking device and superimposable at least partially over the handle to retain it releasably in the locking position in the said seat.The present sash bolt for the closure of shutters will be described hereinbelow making reference to the attached drawing, in which Figure 1 shows an example of a two leaf shutter complete with a closure sash bolt Figures 2 and 3 show, in perspective view, the sash bolt in two positions of use, respectively for the total closure and partial closure of the two shutter leaves Figure 4 shows a section on an enlarged scale, taken on Figure 2, according to the arrows IV IV and Figure 5 shows the handle and the locking device used for a single leaf shutter.With particular reference to the numerical symbols of the said Figures, the sash bolts in question comprises a vertical rod I to the upper and lower ends of which are fixed two hooks 2 and 3 , whilst in its intermediate part there is fixed a support 4 to which is pivoted, with a pin 5 having an axis substantially parallel to the rod, an operating handle 6 intended to engage with a locking device 7 .The vertical rod 1 is rotatably mounted by means of brackets 8 on one leaf 9 of the shutter to be closed, whilst the locking device 7 is fixed on the other leaf 10 of the shutter.The operating handle 6 is able to describe angular displacements about the pin 5 to be brought close to and spaced from the locking device 9 . The handle 6 functions, moreover, as means for determining the rotation in opposite senses of the rod 1 in such a way as to bring the two end hooks into engagement and disengagement with corresponding fixed abutment pins 12 and 13 , for the closure and, respectively, the opening of the shutter.To facilitate the actuation of the vertical rod the handle, at its attachment end to the rod 1 has a shaped prominence 60 which serves to delimit the angle of relative rotation between the handle and the rod.Now, in accordance with the invention, on the upper and lower longitudinal sides of the handle 6 there are formed one, or more preferably as represented in Figures 2 and 3, two pairs of notches 1 4 15 , at different distances from the pin 5 of the handle itself.For its part, the locking device 7 is constituted by a plate 16 having two frontal projections 17 and 18 separated in height to delimit between them a seat or re entrance 19 into which the handle can fit in correspondence with one or the other of the pairs of notches 14 and 15 .More precisely, the frontal projections 17 and 18 of the device are shaped to engage with each pair of recesses 14 and its of the handle, and on at least one of the said projections 17 there is mounted a stop element 20 displaceable towards and away from the seat or re entrance 19 to be superimposed at least in part over the handle 6 when this is lodged therein.For its displacement the stop element 2 has a leg 21 axially retained, but guided, in an oblong space 22 formed in the plate 16 in correspondence with the projection 17 . Therefore, the locking of the leaves 9 and 10 of the shutter, once they have been brought together in the closure position, is obtained by fitting the handle 6 into the seat or re entrance 19 of the device 7 in such a way that the frontal projections 17 and 18 match up with the first pair of recesses 14 , and displacing the stop element 20 to superimpose it over the handle 6 to lock it as shown in Figures 2 and 4 of the drawings.It is also possible to arrange that the stop element automatically moves by gravity into the locking position.On the other hand, opening is effected by displaceing the stop element 20 into the rest position in such a way as to release the handle and enable it to displace to operate the rod 1 with the hooks 2 and 3 . By making the second pair of notches 15 engage the handle 6 with the locking device one can hold the leaves of the shutter in a partially open condition or arrange it ajar as is shown in Figure 3 of the drawing.Finally, it is appropriate to underline that the operating handle 6 , possibly provided with a single pair of lateral notches 14 and the locking device 7 as described above, can be used advantageously also for locking in the closure position shutters having a single shutter leaf 9 .In this case the handle 6 is fitted by means of a support 4 to an edge of the shutter leaf 9 whilst the locking device 7 is fixed on a locking jamb 10 in a position such as to match with the said handle as is shown, for example, in Figure 5 of the drawings.
