## Description
METHOD FOR PRODUCING NON CAKING LIGNOSULFONATE BASED BINDERS FOR PELLETING OF ANIMAL FEEDSTUFFSThe present invention relates to a method for preparing noncaking lignosulfonate based binder for pelleting animal feedstuffs.In recent years considerable effort has been directed to combining various types of animal feed ingredients into pellets and other artificially agglomerated feed forms to produce products of maximal palatability and handling characteristics. The binders currently being used on a large scale constitute various kinds of clays and dried sulfite spent liquors, cf. US patent specification 3 035 920. More complex binder compositions have also been proposed, cf.FI patent specifications 40 509 and 51 035.Present day lignosulfonate based or lignosulfonate containing binders are hygroscopic and exhibit a more or less pronounced tendency to cake, which proves a severe problem to producers and consumers of the material. As the degree of caking relates directly to the moisture content and increases with increasing temperature and pressure, producers are compelled to produce materials with very low moisture contents which are bulky in nature and therefore expensive to trans port employ very effective and expensive cooling before placing the dried material into storage bins and avoid large and therefore economic storage bins to limit pressure.A drawback from the consumers point of view which restricts the use of available spent sulfite liquor preparations for animal feedbinder purposes is the fact that many binders not only cake but even liquify forming sticky sirups when in contact with thecatmosphere. Accordingly, it is necessary to pack, deliver and store these products in moisture proof bags. However, because of handling problems and the additional costs incurred in the disposal of waste packing materials, bagged products are increasingly being rejected by modern feedstuffs mills geared to process hundreds of thousands of tons of materials every year.Because of the afore mentioned drawbacks efforts have been made to reduce and or eliminate the caking tendencies of sulfite spent liquor based binders, hitherto however, without very much success. One known procedure comprises compounding the binder with some 3 to 30 by weight of clay solids SE patent specification 320 568 or with substantially corresponding amounts of mineral type feed additives DE OS 2 749 108 . These additions act as diluents for the lignosulfonate, decreasing the effective contact surface between particles and thus reducing their sticking together.A disadvantage of the method according to the SE patent specification 320 568 is, that the clay addition detracts from the nutritious value of the binder, whereas preblending of binder with other feed components presents a problem to the compounder as it restricts freedom of formulating ratios tDE OS 2 749 108 . Another currently practised procedure, also of limited effectiveness in preventing caking, employs the addition of lime to sulfite spent liquor before drying. For reasons apparent to those skilled in the art, such addition is very difficult to accomplish because it ultimately gives rise to precipitation of basic calcium lignosulfonate which severely complicates subsequent drying operations.A further limitation of treating spent sulfite liquor with lime prior to drying is that the compound reacts with the nutritious carbohydrates present in the sulfite spent liquor by reverting them to acidic products and others thereby reducing the inherent feed value of the binder as the lime content increases and its hygroscopicity decreases.By means of the feed component prepared according to the invention the afore mentioned drawbacks relating to the caking of lignosulfonate based binders may be eliminated or, in other words, the handling characteristics of products exhibiting caking tendency may be substantially improved. The method according to the invention is characterized in that dried calcium, magnesium or sodium based residual pulping liquor obtained in the sulfite cooking of wood, or a mixture thereof, is compounded with such an amount of a calcium hydroxide and or calcium oxide containing compound that the pH of a 5 t aqueous solution of the blend is greater than 5, measured at room temperature. Such conditions serve to ensure sufficiently strong alkalinity at the particle interfaces to bring about the unique and beneficial effect of the binder according to the invention.Preferably, however, in the method according to the invention sufficient basic calcium compound is added to give a pH of 6 to 9, measured in a 5 aqueous solution, and the amount added, calculated as CaO, is. preferably about 1 to 3 t by weight, although the amount required may rise substantially higher, for example to about 10 l, in case dusting is carried out using a coarse calcium compound, or if there is a loss of alkalinity and soluble calcium due to calcium carbonate formation, for example when dusting in the presence of flue gases from the drier operation. Other conditions requiring larger additions of CaO than the preferred 1 to 3 by weight, are encountered when the dried lignosulfonate containing material to be treated exhibits a very low pH, for example less than 3.Correspondingly, the produdt pH need also be greater than the preferred 6 to 9, for example, when treating some type material containing low molecular weight lignosulfonates.The inventive binders remain free flowing even under adverse conditions of high relative humidity and contain virtually all the nutritious value of the original material prone to caking and finally produce a harder and more resilient pellet with increasing pH.In principle any type of pulping liquor raw material may be used for the purpose of our invention limited only in that its combined level of S02 at any stage during the cooking process should have been of the order of 50 or less. of total Lignins , K. Sarkanen C. Ludwig, WileyInterscience, p. 598, 599 . Moreover, the success of the invention is not dependent upon any other factor of the digestion process or based upon any particular type wood furnish. Likewise, any compound containing free calcium hydroxide or oxide is suitable for the practice of our invention. However, for reasons apparent to those skilled in the art we prefer to work with relatively pure calcium hydroxide. While compounding of the dried residual spent liquor and the calcium compound can be accomplished in numerous different ways, such as dry blending and milling, we prefer to integrate the dusting operation with the spray drying of sulfide spent liquor by screw feeding extremely finely divided calcium compound directly into the drying chamber or into the pneumatic transport system conveying dried sulfite spent liquor solids from the spray drying chamber to the collection cyclones and on to the storage bins. The inventive products differ from materials treated with lime in the liquid state in that their hygroscopicity remains virtually unchanged. While it is difficult to precisely explain the beneficial effect of the calcium containing compound on reducing the caking tendency of powdered residual pulping liquor, it is speculated that the dry blending or dusting operation leads to a surface coating of the spent liquor particles. If and when the moisture content rises to sufficient levels the basic calcium compound goes into action producing a localized protective film of insoluble basic calcium lignosulfonate and calcium sugar complexes at the interphase which in turn poses an obstacle to the agglomeration of particles.Under conditions of pelleting, i.e. in the presence of steam, the protective layer is removed and the product functions in normal manner as a binder, the increased pH increasing the degree of neutralization of lignosulfonate and sugar components, thus yielding a substantially harder pellet.Our observation that an increasingly more resilient and harder pellet is obtained with increasing product pH has an important practical consequence in that it allows descreasing the binder content in the feed. This effect may be related to the established reduced solubility of spent sulfite liquor components with increasing lime concentration. Thus when the hitherto used low alkalinity products encounter steam during pelleting conditions they tend to dissolve more readily than the more basic products of our invention. Dissolved binder, however, will penetrate into the feed particles and can no longer contribute to glueing these particles together.The present invention is thus based on the prior unknown principle that dried lignosulfonate matter can be rendered substantially less caking for purposes of storage, handling and transport by dusting it with a basic calcium compound, and that the dusting, most surprisingly, does not only not reduce but in fact improves substantially the binding properties of the lignosulfonate under conditions prevailing during animal feedstuff pelleting.The following non limiting Example is illustrative of the inventive process for reducing the caking tendency of binder material.EXAMPLE Into the pneumatic transport system of a NIRO ATOMIZER model spray drying unit producing 7.2 tons per hour of dried calcium based birch or alternatively for alcohol fermented spruce rayon grade spent sulfite liquor solids containing 6 moisture and exhibiting product pHs of 4.3, was injected immediately below the drying chamber sufficient finely ground calcium hydroxide 99 t passing 0.09 mm mesh, 72 t CaO to increase the respective CaO contents of the two different furnishes by 0.75, 1.5, 2,25 and 3.0 t respectively.The above two raw material furnishes virtually represent extremes in caking tendency. The birch based material contains close to 50 t carbohydrate matter, is difficult to dry and cannot be run normally in the untreated state via storage bins. Moreover, while exhibiting an excellent nutrient value its binding properties are also poor. The fermented spruce based material, on the other hand, contains only 25t carbohydrates, handles relatively easily and constitutes a relatively good binder. On treatment with hydrated lime the caking and binding properties of both type materials improve with increasingCaO content. Thus, it proves possible to raise the handling and binding properties of the original birch furnish to levels normally associated with spruce based products without sacrificing its advantageous nutrient value while the properties of spruce furnish are enhanced to the extent that it becomes virtually non caking under any conditions.Reduction in caking properties is again found to be accompanied by an increase in binder properties manifesting itself in that treated spruce based products produce equally effective binding at lower rates of addition and that they allow a substantially higher molasses content in pellets as compared to untreated material molasses, as is well known, constitute a low cost energy source for ruminant feeds but its rate of inclusion is limited owing to its tendency to give rise to soft and sticky pellets.The caking characteristics of the binders are shown in the appended Figure 1 representing caking as a function of the moisture content and pH, respectively CaO addition of the preparations. The samples were kept for up to two weeks in an exsiccator at 230C over a 21 t sulfuric acid solution representing a relative humidty of 89 . They were judged failed when a hard crust began to develop on the surface of the samples.From Figure 1 it is seen that the tolerance limit for moisture of the samples is significantly extended on addition of hydrated lime. Moreover, it is evident that birch based materials require a product pH of approx.2 units over and above that for spruce based grade in order to match the latter with regard to moisture tolerance. An important aspect of our invention is that it eliminates the need for any pH adjustments in the liquid state. In order to achieve a minima product pH of 4.3 it was in the past frequently necessary to raise the pH of the sulfite spent liquor before drying. We have now found that such pH adjustments are accompanied by a loss in bulk densities for the spray dried product. Thus, a rayon grade birch sulfite spent liquor was found to yield a product exhibiting a bulk density of 680 g l when dried at pH 3.1, while similar type of material containing an extra 1.2 of CaO and exhibiting a pH of 4.3 yielded a density of only 510 g l on a comparable basis.Dusting with CaO to the extent of increasing the CaO levels of the products by 4.2 and 3.0 t respectively product pH s of 9.1 and 8.8 respectively raised the bulk densities by an additional 60 g l in both bases. Differences in lumping could not be observed for the two product versions. For pelleting purposes the feed ingredients are blended evenly and binder is added at a rate of about 3 4 to 12 t on a dry weight basis. Preferably the binder, however, is added to the feed blend at a rate of 1 1 2 to 6 t on a dry weight basis.The pelleting in itself can be carried out in any suitable pelleting device or by using other conventional agglomerating procedures.The invention is not only applicable to the large range of compound feed ratios but can be advantageously used for producing hay, grass meal and alfalfa pellets. It is also to be understood that the present invention may be carried out in practice in different ways and its beneficial effects obtained by different means within the scope of the invention.
