## Description
SHOCK ABSORBER AND AIR SPRING ASSEMBLY FOR TILT CAB VEHICLE Technical Field This invention relates to suspension systems for tilt cab trucks. Specifically, it relates to the shock absorber and spring components of such systems. Brief Summary of the Invention This tilt cab suspension system according to this invention comprises integral shock absorber and air spring assemblies located between the truck frame and the cab.Integral shock absorber and air spring assemblies according to the invention can be located at either the front or the rear of the cab. An embodiment of the integral shock absorber and air spring assembly specifically adapted to be located at the front of the cab features a hydraulic lock which locks the suspension system in the full down position for the entire tilt cycle. At the start of a cab tilt cycle, the vertical component of force from the tilt cylinder s lifts the cab to the top of the suspension members stroke. In this position the cab is unstable and, as more weight is transferred to the suspension members, there is a danger that one or both sides of the cab may fall through the stroke of the cab suspension. This is particularly likely to occur when the cab is being pulled back from the over center position, since the tilt cylinders have a force component that pulls down on the suspension members during that portion of the tilt cycle.Damage to the cab and to truck chassis components such as the radiator is likely to occur if the cab falls in this manner. The integral shock absorber and air spring assembly disclosed herein eliminates this problem.

Detailed Description of the Presently Preferred Embodiments Figure 1 shows a conventional tilt cab truck comprising an elongated chassis member 10, a cab member 12 mounted on the chassis member 10 for pivotal movement about an exis 14 transverse to the longitudinal axis of the chassis member 10 from a lowered first position shown in Figure 1 to a raised second position. An integral shock absorber and air spring assembly 16 as shown in detail in Figures 3 6 is located at each of the front corners between the chassis member 10 and the cab member 12.An integral shock absorber and air spring assembly 18 as shown in detail in Figure 10 is located at each of the rear corners between the chassis member 10 and the cab member 12, and a latch mechanism 20 is located at each of the rear corners between the assembly 18 and the chassis member 10.Structure of the First Embodiment Turning to Figures 4 6, it will be seen that the shock absorber and air spring assembly 16 comprises a first base 22 adapted to be attached to the cab member 12 by a plurality of bolt holes 24, a second base 26 adapted to be attached to the chassis member 10 by a plurality of bolt holes 28, a shock absorber sub assembly 30, and an air spring sub assembly 32. The shock absorber sub assembly 30 comprises a rod 34 projecting from the first base 22, a cylinder o6 projecting from the second base 26 and containing a bore 38 closed at the end remote from the second base 26 by a cap 40 through which the rod 34 slidingly projects, and a piston 42 carried by the rod 34 within the bore 38. The piston 42 is preferably in sealing contact with the bore 38, but a first path of fluid communication 44 leads through the piston 42. A reservoir 46 for hydraulic fluids is located in the second base 26, and a second path of fluid communication 48 leads though the cylinder 36 between the reservoir 46 and the bore 38 near the lower end of the stroke of the piston 42. The air spring sub assembly 32 comprises an air bag 52 surrounding the rod 34 and the cylinder 36 and a fourth path of fluid communications 54 for communicating air under pressure to and from the air bag 52. The air bag 52 is connected at its upper end to the first base 22 and at its lower end to the second base 26. Alternatively, the air bag 52 could be connected at its lower end to the cylinder 36, but, in this embodiment, the second base 26 composes an upper component 56 threadedly mounted at 58 on a lower component 60, the air bag 52 is connected to the upper component 56, and the cylinder 36 is mounted on the lower component 60. This configuration permits the lower component 60 and the cylinder 36 to be removed separately for maintenance without disturbing the air spring sub assembly 32. In the presently preferred embodiment, the fourth path of fluid communication 54 passes through the first base 22 and leads to an external source 62 of high pressure air shown only in Figure 3 . Since the assembly 16 is disclosed in the context of a tilt cab truck, the rod 34 is mounted on the first base 22 by means of a universal joint 64 to permit the first base 22 to pivot relative to the rod 34 as the cab member 12 pivots relative to the chassis member 10. However, it will be appreciated that, if the assembly 16 is used in a context where the first base 22 and the second base 26 move only vertically relative to each other, the universal joint 64 can be dispensed with. The first path of fluid communication 44 has a small cross sectional area, which restricts the passage of hydraulic fluid through it to a slower flow rate than is possible through the second and third paths of fluid communication 48 and 50. Additionally, a one way valve 66 which permits upwards flow but which prevents downwards flow is located in the first path of fluid communication 44. The second path of fluid communication 48 starts with a plurality of axially spaced passageways 68 leading through the cylinder 36 to an annular chamber 70 between the cylinder 36 and the upper component 56 of the second base 26. The purpose of having a plurality of axially spaced passageways 68 is to affect the reaction characteristics of the shock absorber sub assembly 30.When the piston 42 begins an upwards stroke, all of the passageways 68 are obstructed by the piston 42, and the flow of the hydraulic fluid becomes much more restricted. It will be noted that the cross sectional area of the passageway 68 closer to the cap 40 is smaller than the cross sectional areas of the passageways 68 farther away from the cap 40, which also contributes to the differential and progressive nature of the damping.Moreover, it will be noted that the uppermost passageway 68 is spaced from the cap 40, so that the incompressible hydraulic fluid will be trapped in the bore 38 above the piston 42 when the piston 42 cuts off the uppermost passageway 68, preventing the piston 42 from striking the cap 40. The annular chamber 70 communicates with a passageway 72 in the lower component 60 of the second base 26, and the passageway 72 leads to the reservoir 46. A selectively operable valve 74 is located in the passageway 72. Air pilot pressure is communicated to the valve 74 through a passageway 76 in the second base 26, opening the valve 74 against the urging of a spring 78 and permitting flow of hydraulic fluid through the second path of fluid communication 48. However, when the air pilot pressure is turned off, the spring 78 closes the valve 74, blocking the second path of fluid communication 48. The third path of fluid communication 50 also comprises a plurality of small axially spaced passageways 80 leading through the cylinder 36 from the bore 38, and their axial spacing accomplishes the same purpose as the axial spacing of the passageways 68. However, in this case, another much large passageway 82 containing a oneway flapper valve 84 which permits upwards flow but which prevents downwards flow is also provided. It should be noted that the passageways 80 are open even when the passageway 82 is closed by the one way valve 84. The passageways 80 and 82 join in a single passageway 86 which leads to the reservoir 46. A further optional feature of the shock absorber sub assembly 30 is a selectively operable variable orifice mechanism 88 shown only in Figure 5 in the second path of fluid communication 48. The mechanism 88 can, for instance, comprise a conical valve actuation of which is under the control of the truck driver, thus permitting the truck driver to control the stiffness of the shock absorber sub assembly 30. The second base 26 is formed with an external neck 90 adjacent to the air bag 52, and the air bag 52 is designed so that, when it expands, it expands into the neck 90. This construction permits the external, or radial, dimensions of the air bag 52 to remain approximately uniform as the air bag 52 expands and contracts. A resilient pad 92 is provided on top of the upper component 56 to cushion the jar when the first base 22 contacts the upper component of the second base 26.Operation of the First Embodiment When the truck is travelling over the road, the air bag 52 is inflated, tending to hold the piston 42 in the middle of the bore 38. Air pilot pressure is communicated to the valve 74 through the passageway 76, and the second path of fluid communication 48 is open. When an unevenness in the road causes the piston 42 to move upwardly in the bore 38, the one way valve 66 in the first path of fluid communication 44 is closed by hydraulic pressure. Hydraulic fluid exits the bore 38 above the piston 42 through the second path of fluid communication 48 and flows to the reservoir 46. At the same time, fluid from the reservoir 46 flows through the third path of communication 50 including the passageways 80, 82, and 86 to the bore 38 beneath the piston 42. When the piston 42 moves downwardly in the bore 38, the one way valve 66 in the first path of fluid communication 44 is opened by hydraulic pressure. Accordingly, hydraulic fluid exits the bore 38 below the piston 42 both through the first path of fluid communication 44 leading to the bore 38 above the piston 42 and through the third path of fluid communication 50 leading to the reservoir 46. However, downward movement of the piston 42 causes hydraulic pressure to close the one way valve 84 in the third path of fluid communication 50, which means that hydraulic fluid exits the bore 38 beneath the piston 42 only through first means of fluid communication 44 and passageways 80, both of which are restricted.Since the effective cross sectional areas of the passageways 80 is much smaller than the effective crosssectional area of the first path of fluid communication 44, most of the flow from the bore 38 beneath the piston 42 is through the first path of fluid communication 44 to the bore 38 above the piston 42, and, since the rod 34 is coming into the bore 38 above the piston 42, the available volume of the bore 38 beneath the piston 42 decreases faster than the available volume of the bore 38 above the piston 42 increases. The net effect is that hydraulic fluid exits the bore 38 above the piston 42 when the piston 42 is moving downwardly as well as when it moves upwardly. In other words, there is a constant counter clockwise flow through the circuit as seen in Figures 3 and 4 the flow is never clockwise. Since the effective cross sectional areas of the second path of fluid communication 48 is smaller than the effective cross sectional area of the first path of fluid communication 44 when the one way valve 66 is open plus the cross sectional area of the third path of fluid communication 50 when the one way valve 84 is closed, the shock absorber sub assembly 30 has a larger damping effect when the piston 42 is moving upwardly than when the piston 42 is moving downwardly. When it is desired to tilt the cab member 12 relative to the chassis member 10, air is drained from the air bag 52, allowing the piston 42 to sink to the bottom of the bore 38, and the air pilot pressure is turned off, allowing the valve 74 to close. Closing the valve 74 blocks the second path of fluid communication 48 and traps hydraulic fluid in the bore 38 above the piston 42. At the same time, the hydraulic fluid in the bore 38 beneath piston 42 forces open the one way valve 66, filling the gradually increasing volume of the bore 38 above the piston 42.Hydraulic fluid which will not fit in the bore 38 above the piston 42 drains slowly to the reservoir 46 through the passageways 80, the hydraulic pressure having closed the one way valve 84 in the passageway 82. Since the reservoir 46 must be large enough to accomodate hydraulic fluid displaced by entry of the rod 34 into the bore 38 during the over the road travel, there is room in the reservoir 46 for all the hydraulic fluid displaced by the gradual downward movement of the piston 42. Thus, when the piston 42 comes to rest on the bottom of the cylinder 36, the entire bore 38 above the piston 42 and the second passageway 48 above the valve 74 are both filled with hydraulic fluid. After the piston 42 has come to rest on the bottom of the cylinder 36, the tilt cylinders not shown are actuated. As explained previously, in prior art devices actuation of the tilt cylinders lifts the cab member to the top of the suspension members strokes, thus cseatinq a dangerous situation. As will be readily appreciatede however, the incompressable volume of hydraulic fluid locked above the piston 42 in the present device prevents this from happening.Structure of the Second Embodiment Figures 7 and 8 show only the shock absorber and air spring assembly 100 of a second embodiment of the subject invention. The shock absorber sub assembly 100 comprises a rod 102 projecting from the first base not shown , a cylinder 104 projecting from the second base not shown and containing a bore 106 closed at the end remote from the second base by a cap 108 through which the rod 102 slidingly projects, and a piston 110 carried by the rod 102 within the bore 106. The piston 110 is preferably in loosely sliding contact with the bore 106, permitting some peripheral leakage around the piston 110 in either direction of motion of that piston. Additionally, a first path of fluid communication 112 leads through the piston 110. A reservoir 114 for hydraulic fluid surrounds the cylinder 104 near its lower end, and a reservoir 116 for hydraulic fluid surrounds the cylinder 104 near its upper end. A second path of fluid communication 118 leads from the bore 106 near the cap, 108 through the cylinder 104 to the reservoir 116 and through a series of spring operated check valves 120 to the reservoir 114. A third path of fluid communication 122 leads from the reservoir 114 to the bore 106 near the end of the bore 106 remote from the cap 108. The cylinder 104 is mounted in a lower housing 124 which, together with the exterior of the cylinder 104, defines the reservoir 114, and the cap 108 is mounted in an upper housing 126 which, together with the exterior of the cylinder 104, define the reservoir 116. The first path of fluid communication 112 has a small cross sectional area, which restricts the passage of hydraulic fluid through it to a slower flow rate than is possible through the second and third paths of fluid communication 118 and 122. Additionally, a one way valve 128 which permits upward flow but which prevents downward flow is located in the first path of fluid communication 112. The second path of fluid communication 118 starts with a plurality of axially spaced passageways 130 leading through the cylinder 104 to the reservoir 116 between the cylinder 104 and the upper housing 126. As with the first embodiment, the purpose of having a plurality of axially spaced passageways 130 is to affect the reaction characteristics of the shock absorber sub assembly 100.When the piston 110 begins an upwards stroke, all of the passageways 130 are unobstructed, and the flow of hydraulic fluid through the passageways 130 is relatively free.However, towards the end of an upwards stroke, the lower passageways are obstructed by the piston 110, and the flow of the hydraulic fluid becomes much more restricted. It will be noted that, as with the first embodiment, the cross sectional area of the passageways 130 closer to the cap 108 is smaller than the cross sectional areas of the passageways 130 farther away from the cap 108, which also contributes to the differential and progressive nature of the damping. Moreover, it will be noted that the uppermost passageway 130 is again spaced from the cap 108, so that incompressible hydraulic fluid will be trapped in the bore 106 above the piston 110 when the piston 110 cuts off the uppermost passageway 130. While there is some peripheral leakage around the piston 110, it is a very small flow, and upperward surges are of very short duration, so that, in practice, the piston 110 is again prevented from striking the cap 108 by the locked hydraulic fluid. The plurality of spring operated check valves 120 are mounted in the second path of fluid communication 118 where it enters the lower housing 124. The check valves 120 permit hydraulic fluid to flow downwards into the reservoir 114, but do not permit hydraulic fluid to flow upwards from the reservoir 114 into the reservoir 116. As with the first embodiment, a resilient padding 132 is provided on top of the upper housing 126 to cushion the jar when the first base not shown contacts the upper housing 126 which is fixedly mounted on the second base by means not shown .Operation of the Second Embodiment In operation, when an upstroke is caused by a jarring of the truck as it rides over an obstruction, the fluid paths are as shown by the arrows in Figure 7. That is, hydraulic fluid from the bore 106 above the piston 110 is forced around the piston 110 to the bore 106 beneath the piston 110 to some degree, but it is mostly forced through the passageways 130, the reservoir 116, the check valves 120, the reservoir 114, and the third path of fluid communication 122 to the bore 106 beneath the piston 110. When the upstroke is completed and the rod 102 begins to settle back down under the force of gravity, the check valves 120 close, and communication from the bore 106 beneath the piston 110 to the bore 106 above the piston 110 is limited to the first path of fluid communication 112 and to peripheral leakage around the piston 110.Since the rod 102 is re entering the bore 106 during this phase of the operation, the volume of hydraulic fluid which exits the bore 106 beneath the piston 110 exceeds the volume which becomes available for it in the bore 106 above the piston 110, and the excess is forced out through the passageways 130 into the reservoir 116 as indicated by the arrows in Figure 8. Third Embodiment The third embodiment, shown in Figure 9, is identical to the embodiments shown in Figures 7 and 8 except that the air bag 52, which functions as a spring, has been replaced with a mechanical spring 134. In this embodiment, means not shown must be provided to bring the first base into contact with the second base against the urgings of the spring 134 when it is desired to lock the assembly in the down position prior to tilting the cab member 12.Fourth Embodiment A fourth embodiment, particularly adapted for use at the rear corners of the cab, is shown in Figure 10. It comprises a first base 136 adapted to be attached to the cab member 12 by a plurality of bolt holes 138, a second base 140 adapted to be attached to the latch mechanism 20 by a bolt 142, a shock absorber sub assembly 144, and an air spring sub assembly 146. The shock absorber sub assembly 144 comprises a rod 148 projecting from the first base 136, a cylinder 150 projecting from the second base 140 and containing a bore 152 closed at the end remote from the second base 140 by a cap 154 through which the rod 148 slidingly projects, and a piston 156 carried by the rod 148 within the bore 152. The piston 156 is preferably in sealing contact with the bore 152, but a first path of fluid communication 158 leads through the piston 156. A reservoir 160 for hydraulic fluids surrounds the cylinder 150, and a second path of fluid communicatioon 162 leads through the cylinder 150 between the reservoir 160 and the bore 152 near the upper end of the stroke of piston 156. A third path of fluid communication 164 leads through the cylinder 150 between the reservoir 160 and the bore 156 near the lower end of the stroke of the piston 156. The air spring sub assembly 146 comprises an air bag 166 surrounding the rod 148 and the cylinder 150 and a fourth path of fluid communications 168 for communicating air under pressure to and from the air bag 166. The air bag 166 is connected at its upper end to the first base 136 and at its lower end to the second base 140.Alternatively, the air bag 166 could be connected at its lower end to the cylinder 150, but, in this embodiment, the second base 140 comprises an upper component 168 threadedly mounted at 170 on a lower component 172, the air bag 166 is connected to the upper component 168, and the cylinder 150 is mounted on the lower component 172.This configuration permits the lower component 172 and the cylinder 150 to be removed separately for maintenance without disturbing the air spring sub assembly 146. In the presently preferred embodiment, the fourth path of fluid communication 168 passes through the first base 136 and leads to an external source of high pressure air not shown . Since the assembly 18 is disclosed in the context of a tilt cab truck, the rod 148 is mounted on the first base 136 by means of a universal joint 174 to permit the first base 136 to pivot relative to the rod 148 as the cab member 12 pivots relative to the chassis member 10.However, it will be appreciated that, if the assembly 18 is used in a context where the first member 136 and the second member 140 move only vertically relative to each other, the universal joint 174 can be dispensed with. The first path of fluid communication 158 has a small cross sectional area, which restricts the passage of hydraulic fluid through it to a slower flow rate than is possible through the second and third paths of fluid communication 162 and 164. Additionally, a one way valve 176 which permits upwards flow but which prevents downwards flow is located in the first path of fluid communication 158. The second path of fluid communication 162 comprises a plurality of axially spaced passageways leading through the cylinder 150 to the reservoir 160. The purpose of having a plurality of axially spaced passageways is to affect the reaction characteristics of the shock absorber sub assembly 144. When the piston 156 begins an upwards stroke, all of the passageways are unobstructed, and the flow of hydraulic fluid out of the passageways 162 is relatively free. However, towards the end of an upwards stroke, the lower passageways are obstructed by the piston 156, and the flow of the hydraulic fluid becomes much more restricted. It will be noted that the cross sectional area of the passageways comprising the second path of fluid communication 162 close to the cap 154 are smaller than the cross sectional areas of the passageways farther away from the cap 154, which also contributes to the differential and progressive nature of the damping. Moreover, it will be noted that the uppermost passageway is spaced from the cap 154, so that incompressible hydraulic fluid will be trapped in the bore 152 above the piston 156 when the piston 156 cuts off the uppermost passageway, preventing the piston 156 from striking the cap 154. The third path of fluid communication 164 also comprises a plurality of small axially spaced passageways leading through the cylinder 150 from the bore 152, and their axial spacing accomplishes the same purpose as the axial spacing of the passageways comprising the second path of fluid communication 162. The second base 140 is formed with an external neck 178 adjacent to the air bag 166, and sthe air bag 166 is designed so that, when it expands, it expands into the neck 178. This construction permits the external, or radial, dimensions of the air bag 166 to remain approximately uniform as the air bag 166 expands and contracts. An elastomeric pad 180 is provided at the top of the upper component 168 of the second base 140 to cushion the jar if the first base 136 comes into contact with the second base 140. Operation of the Assembly 18 When the truck is travelling over the road, the air bag 166 is inflated, tending to hold the piston 156 in the middle of the bore 152. When an unevenness in the road causes the piston 156 to move upwardly in the bore 152, the one way valve 176 is closed by hydraulic pressure.Hydraulic fluid exits the bore 152 above the piston 156 through the second path of fluid communication 162 and flows into the reservoir 160. At the same time, fluid flows from the reservoir 160 through the third path of fluid communication 164 into the bore 152 beneath the piston 156. Conversely, when an unevenness in the road causes the piston 156 to move downwardly in the bore 152, the one way valve 176 is opened by hydraulic pressure.Hydraulic fluid exits the bore 152 beneath the piston 156 through the first path of fluid communication 158. Since the effective volume of the bore 152 beneath the piston 156 is decreased faster than the effective volume of the bore 152 above the piston 156 is increased due to the presence of the rod 148 in the latter , hydraulic fluid from the bore 152 above the piston 156 is forced through the second path of fluid communication 162 as the piston 156 moves downwardly, causing a counter clockwise flow in Figure 10 of the hydraulic fluid regardless of the direction of motion of the piston 156.Fifth Embodiment The shock absorber sub assembly 216 comprises a rod 220 projecting from the first base 210, a cylinder 222 projecting from the second base 212 and containing a bore 224 closed at the end remote from the second base 212 by a cap 226 through which the rod 220 slidingly projects, and a piston 228 carried by the rod 220 within the bore 224. The piston 228 is not in sealing contact with the bore 224, but permits a small amount of restricted flow in either direction, as indicated by the arrows in Figures 11 and 13. In addition, a conduit 230 leads through the piston 228. The conduit 230 contains a one way valve 232 which permits flow from beneath the piston 228 to above the piston 228, but prevents flow in the opposite direction. An annular reservoir 234 is contained in the second base 212 surrounding the cylinder 222. The second base 212 comprises an upper component 236 and a lower component 238. The upper component 236 is a cup shaped member which has an axial bore 240 which receives the cap 226.The upper component is threadedly mounted on the lower component 238 at 241 so that the lower component 238 and the cylinder 222 can be removed separately for maintenance without disturbing the air spring sub assembly 218. The reservoir 234 extends into both the upper component 236 and the lower component 238. One or a plurality of axially spaced conduits 242 lead from the bore 224 near the cap 226 to a conduit 244 in the cylinder 222. The purpose of having a plurality of axially spaced conduits 242 is to gradually affect the reaction characteristics of the shock absorber subassembly 216. When the piston 228 begins an upward stroke, all of the conduits 242 are unobstructed, and the flow of hydraulic fluid out of the conduits 242 is relatively free. However, towards the end of an upward stroke, the lower conduits 242 are obstructed by the piston 228, and the flow of the hydraulic fluid becomes much more restricted. It has been found in practice that having a single conduit 242 near the top of the stroke works best.Moreover, it should be noted that, if a plurality of conduits 242 are used, the lowest conduit 242 should not be more than one piston width from the top of the stroke, since otherwise leakage may occur from above the piston directly to the chamber below the piston, rendering the adjustable orifice useless. It will be noted that the uppermost conduit 242 is spaced from the cap 226. Accordingly, incompressible hydraulic fluid will be trapped in the bore 224 above the piston 228 when the piston 228 cuts off the upperm conduit 242 except for the severely restricted clearan around the piston 228. This configuration greatly slower upward travel of the piston 228 at the end of its stroke and prevents contact between the piston 228 and the cap 226 in all but the most extreme cases. The conduit 244 communicates with an annular groove 246 in the end of the cylinder 222 which abuts the second base 212. The purpose of the annular groove 246 is to make the angular orientation of the cylinder 222 relative to the second base 212 irrelevant. The annular groove 246 in turn communicates with a longitudinal blind bore 248 which extends vertically from the face of the second base 212 which abuts with the cylinder 222. The blind bore 248 communicates with a stepped radial bore 250 which contains a needle valve 252 described hereinafter.The stepped radial bore 250 communicates with an axial blind bore 254 which extends vertically from the face of the second base 212 which defines the bottom of the bore 224. However, the bore 254 is plugged at 256. The axial bore 254 communicates with another radial bore 258 plugged at 260 , and the radial bore 258 communicates with another blind longitudinal bore 262 which, finally, communicates with the reservoir 234. Turning to Figures 12 and 14, it will be seen that the reservoir 234 also communicates with two stepped bores 264 which are plugged at 266 and which contain oneway valves 268. Angled bore 270 provides communication between the stepped bores 264 and the lower face of the bore 224, and the one way valve 268 permit flow from the reservoir 234 through the stepped bores 264 and the angled bores 270 to the bore 224, but prevent flow in the opposite direction. Returning to the needle valve 252 shown in Figures 11 and 13 , it will be seen that it partially obstructs the radial bore 250. However, its position in the radial bore 250 is under the control of the operator of the truck via a cable 272, which permits the operator of the truck to control the hardness of the ride. In the downstroke mode, flow through the damper piston keeps the chamber above the damper piston full.Accordingly, damping of the piston in the downstroke mode is altered by the adjustable orifice i.e., the conduits 242 to the extent that the volume of hydraulic fluid displaced by the rod must pass through the adjustable orifice. Thus, the adjustable orifice controls damping of the piston in both directions, although it controls downstroke damping to a lesser extent than it controls upstroke damping. It should also be noted that the ratio of rod size to bore size i.e., the width of the annular clearance between the piston and the cylinder can be altered to increase or decrease the amount of downstroke damping that is affected by the adjustable orifice.The Air Spring Sub Assembly 218 The air spring sub assembly 218 comprises an air bag 280 surrounding the rod 220 and the cylinder 222. A conduit not shown communicates air under pressure to and from the air bag 280. The air bag 280 is connected at its upper end to the first base 210 and at its lower end to the upper component 236 of the second base 212.Alternatively, the air bag 280 coyld be connected at its lower end to the lower component 238 of the second base 212, but the illustrated configuration facilitates disassembly for maintenance. Since the subject shock absorber and air spring assembly is particularly well adopted for use on a tilt cab truck, the rod 220 is mounted on the first base 210 by means of a universal joint 282. However, it will be appreciated that, if the assembly is used in a context where the first base 210 and the second base 212 move only vertically relative to each other, the universal joint 286 can be dispensed with. The lower component 238 of the second base 212 is formed with an external neck 284 adjacent to the air bag 280, and the air bag 280 is designed so that, when it expands, it expands into the neck 284.Operation of the Shock Absorber and Air Spring Assembly When a truck incorporating the subject shock absorber and air spring assembly is travelling over the road, the air bag 280 is inflated to a pressure controlled by a levelling valve, tending to hold the piston 228 in the middle of the bore 224. When an unevenness in the road causes the piston 228 to move upwardly in the bore 224 as shown in Figures 11 and 12 , the one way valve 232 in the conduit 230 is closed by hydraulic pressure. Some hydraulic fluid leaks around the piston 228, but most of the hydraulic fluid above the piston 228 exits the bore 224 through the conduits 242. From the conduits 242 it flows through the conduit 244, the groove 246, the bore 248, the bore 250, around the needle valve 252, and through the bore 252, the bore 258, and the bore 262 to the reservoir 234.From the reservoir 234 it flows through the bores 264 unseating the one way valve 268 and the bores 270 to the bore 224 beneath the piston 228. When an unevenness in the road causes the piston 228 to move downwardly in the bore 224 as shown in Figures 13 and 14 , the one way valves 268 are closed by hydraulic pressure, but the one way valve 232 is opened. Thus, hydraulic fluid from the bore 224 beneath the piston 228 flows upwardly through the conduit 230 as well as around the piston 228 to the bore 224 above the piston 228.From there it flows through the conduits 242, the conduit 244, the groove 246, the bore 248, the bore 250, around the needle valve 252, and through the bore 254, the bore 258, and the bore 262 to the reservoir 234 as before.Since the decrease in volume in the bore 224 beneath the piston 228 is greater than the increase in volume in the bore 224 above the piston 228 due to the presence of the rod in the latter, the bore 224 above the piston 228 remains filled with hydraulic fluid as the piston 228 moves downwardly. It should be noted that the cross sectional area of the conduit 230 below the one way valve 232 is preferably significantly smaller than the total cross sectional areas of the conduits 242, so that the downward stroke of the piston 228 is initially much more damped than its upward stroke.Sixth embodiment The embodiment shown in Figures 15 to 18 comprises a first base 10 adapted to be attached to a cab member not shown a second base 12 adapted to be attached to a cab latch mechanism 14, a shock absorber sub assembly 16, and an air spring sub assembly 18.The Shock Absorber Sub Assembly 16 The shock absorber sub assembly 16 comprises a rod 20 projecting from the first base LO, a cylinder 22 projecting from the second base 12 and containing a bore 24 closed at the end remote from the second base 12 by a cap 26 through which the rod 20 slidingly projects, and a piston 28 carried by the rod 20 within the bore 24. The piston 28 is not in sealing contact with the bore 24, but permits a small amount of restricted flow in either direction, as indicated by the arrows in Figures 15 and 17. In addition, a conduit 30 leads through the piston 28. The conduit 30 contains a one way valve 32 which permits flow from beneath the piston 28 to above the piston 28, but prevents flow in the opposite direction. An annular reservoir 34 is contained in the second base 12 surrounding the cylinder 22. The second base 12 comprises an upper component 36 and a lower component 38. The upper component 36 is a cup shaped member which has an axial bore 40 which receives the cap 26. The upper component 36 is threadedly mounted on the lower component 38 at 42 so that the lower component 38 and the cylinder 22 can be removed separately for maintenance without disturbing the air spring sub assembly 18. The reservoir 34 extends into both the upper component 36 and the lower component 38. A plurality of axially spaced conduits 44 lead from the bore 24 near the cap 26 to the reservoir 34.The purpose of having a plurality of axially spaced conduits 44 is to affect the reaction characteristics of the shock absorber sub assembly 16. When the piston 28 begins an upward stroke, all of the conduits 44 are unobstructed, and the flow of hydraulic fluid out the conduits 44 is relatively free. However, towards the end of an upward stroke, the lower conduits 44 are obstructed by the piston 28, and the flow of the hydraulic fluid becomes much more restricted.Moreover, it will be noted that the uppermost conduit 44 is spaced from the cap 26. Accordingly, incompressible hydraulic fluid will be trapped in the bore 24 above the piston 28 when the piston 28 cuts off the uppermost conduit 44, except for the severely restricted clearance around the piston 28. This configuration greatly slows upward travel of the piston 28 at the end of its stroke and prevents contact between the piston 28 and the cap 26 in all but the most extreme cases. A blind axial bore 46 extends vertically from the face of the second base 12 which defines the bottom of the bore 24. The axial bore 46 communicates with a stepped radial bore 48 which contains a needle valve 50 described hereinafter. The radial bore 48 is plugged at 52 and contains a one way valve 54 which permits flow of hydraulic fluid from the bore 24 beneath the piston 28 to the bore 24 above the piston 28, but prevents flow in the other direction. The radial bore 48 in turn communicates with a longitudinal blind bore 56 which extends vertically to the face of the second base 12. There the longitudinal bore 56 communicates with an annular groove 58 in the end of the cylinder 22 which abuts the second base 12. The purpose of the annular groove 58 is to make the angular orientation of the cylinder 22 relative to the second base 12 irrelevant.The annular groove 58 in turn communicates with a longitudinal conduit 60 in the cylinder 22 which extends nearly the length of the cylinder 22 and which communicates with the bore 24 adjacent the cap 26. Turning to Figures 16 and 18, it will be seen that the reservoir 34 also communicates with two stepped bores 62 which are plugged at 64 and which contain one way valves 66. Angled bores 68 provide communication between the stepped bores 62 and the lower face of the bore 24, and the one way valves 66 permit flow from the reservoir 34 through the stepped bores 62 and the angles bores 68 to the bore 24, but prevent flow in the opposite direction. Returning to the needle valve 50 shown in Figures 15 and 17 , it will be seen that it partially obstructs the radial bore 48. However, its position in the radial bore 48 is under the control of the operator of the truck via a cable 70, which permits the operator of the truck to control the damping rate of the suspension device.The Air Spring Sub Assembly 18 The air spring sub assemblv 18 comprises an air bag 80 surrounding the rod 20 and the cylinder 22.A conduit not shown communicates air under pressure to and from the air bag 80. The air bag 80 is connected at its upper end to the first base 1O and at its lower end to the upper component 36 of the second base 12.Alternatively, the air bag 80 could be connected at its lower end to the component 38 beneath the reservoir 34, but the illustrated configuration facilities disassembl for maintenance. Since the subject shack absorber and air s2r a bly is particularly well adapted for use on a tilt cab truck, the rod 20 is mounted on the first base 10 by n of a universal joint 82. However, it will be appreciated that, if the assembly is used in a context where the first base 10 and the second base 12 move only vertically relative to each other, the universal joint 82 can be dispensed with. The lower component 38 of the second base 12 is formed with an external neck 84 adjacent to the air bag 80, and the air bag 80 is designed so that, when it expands, it expands into the neck 84. This construction provides the proper rolling surface for the air bag 80. The geometry of the neck 84 can be altered to control the spring characteristics of the air bag 80.Operation of the Shock Absorber and Air Spring Assembly When a truck incorporating the subject shock absorber and air spring assembly is travelling over the road, the air bag 80 is inflated. A separate levelling valve controls the mean position of the piston 28. When an unevenness in the road causes the Diston 28 to move upwardly in the bore 24 as shown in Figures 15 and 1 , the one way valve 32 in the conduit 30 and the one way valve 54 in the stepped bore 48 are closed by hydraulic pressure. Some hydraulic fluid leaks around the piston 28, but most of the hydraulic fluid above the piston 28 exits the bore 24 to the reservoir 34 through the conduits 44.From the reservoir 34, the hydraulic fluid flows through the bores 62 unseating the one way valves 66 and the bores 68 to the bore 24 beneath the piston 28. When an unevenness in the road causes the piston 28 to move downwardly in the bore 24 as shown inFigures 17 and 18 , the one way valves 66 are closed by hydraulic pressure, but the one way valves 32 and 54 are opened. Thus, hydraulic fluid from the bore 24 beneath the piston 28 flows upwardly through the conduit 30 as well as around the piston 28 to the bore 24 above the piston 28 and downwardly through the bore 46, the bore 48, around the needle valve 50, past the open one way valve 54, and up through the bore 56, the annular groove 58, and the conduit 60 to the bore 24 above the piston 28. It should be noted that the cross sectional area of the conduit 30 below the one way valve 32 is preferably significantly smaller than the total cross sectional areas of the conduits 44, so that the downward stroke of the piston 28 is initially much more damped than its upward stroke. It will be seen that the construction provides the capability of remotely adjusting the amount of damping on the downstroke of the damper piston. In the downstroke mode there are three paths for hydraulic fluid to transfer from the chamber below the piston to the chamber above the piston. A relatively small amount of hydraulic fluid leaks around the piston.A portion of the hydraulic fluid flows through a restricted one way orifice in the piston. The re aining hydraulic fluid is forced past a remotely adjustable orifice in the base of the damper, past a one way valve, and is deposited in the chamber above the piston. The orifice in the piston is optional.If used, it fixes the maximum amount of downstroke damping obtainable.
