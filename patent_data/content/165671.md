# Passive sampling interferometric sensor arrays.

## Abstract
This invention provides a sensor array using a plural ity of fiber optic sensors connected between transmit fibers and receive fibers. The laser transmitter supplies pulses to the transmit fiber and fiber optic couplers couple the pulses from the transmit fiber into the fiber optic sensors The pulses from the laser transmitter may be frequency chirped or frequency stepped to provide passive sampling of inter ferometric sensors in addition to intensity sensors, or otherwise frequency modulated. Each sensor is configured to respond to changes in a predetermined physical para meter by altering the shape of the pulse thereto. Fiber optic couplers couple the sensor output signals into the receive fiber for input to a receiver, which converts the optical signals into electrical signals for input to a processor. A timing reference correlates the sensor output pulses with the sensors.
