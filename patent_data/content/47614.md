# Circuit for controlling an electromagnet.

## Abstract
A control circuit for an electromagnet includes a main current control element 10 in series with the electromagnet winding 12 and controlled so as to switch on a pass a pull in current for an initial period and to control the current to a lower hold level during a subsequent period. A capacitor 50 is connected in series with a diode 51 and a transistor 52 across the winding 10 and the transistor 52 is controlled to switch on during the change from pull in to hold so that the capacitor is charged up during this change. A second transis tor 61 is connected in series with a second diode 60 to per mit reverse current flow from the capacitor to the winding dur ing switch off to hasten collapse of the flux in the winding and overcome the drop out delaying effect of eddy currents in the electromagnet core.
