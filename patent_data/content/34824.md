# Method and apparatus for the fabrication of a bag in box package.

## Abstract
For the fabrication of a bag in box BIB package B there is first provided a semifinished, collapsed BIB package wherein a flattened bag 4 is placed within a collapsed box 2 and secured to at least one of its inside surfaces by means of an adhesive 78 . After erecting the package, the bag 4 is inflated into close internal contact with the box 2 by introduc ing a gas under pressure through a fitment 70 attached to the bag and projecting outwardly of the box. The opposite ends of the box are closed with sets of foldable end flaps 30, 32, 34, 36 52, 54, 56, 58 , with the aid of an adhesive. Preferably, the bag 4 is further secured to the inside surfaces of a pair of opposed ones 54, 56 of the four bottom end flaps of the box. The opposed pair 54, 56 of bottom flaps are held folded out during the introduction of the pressurized gas into the bag 4 , in order that the bottom end portion of the inflated bag may make neat contact with the inside surfaces of the box. There is also disclosed herein an apparatus for thus fabricating the BIB package.
