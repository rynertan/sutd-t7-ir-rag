## Description
STABILIZED 4 CARBAMOYL IMIDAZOLIUM 5 OLATE The present invention relates to a method for stabilizing preparations containing 4 carbamoyl imidazolium 5 olate or its salt or hydrate thereof hereinafter referred to as the compound as an active ingredient, the stabilized preparations and a method for the production thereof. The compound is a well known one and known to have a strong carcinostatic activity Canadian Patent No.1,078,736 . The compound has the property of coloring easily on exposure to oxygen, heat or light, and when the compound is formulated, for example into oral administration preparations, it is observed that the coloration of the compound tends to become more marked by the interaction of the compound with the coexisting vehicles accompanied by complicated reactions. The conventionally well known method to prevent this coloration in designing preparations is to use sulfur compounds producing HSO3, S032 or S205 ions as a stabilizing agent as disclosed in EP 5205 Patent Application No.81305148.9. These sulfur compounds display strong power in preventing the coloration of the compound, but when preparations containing them are taken, their peculiar offensive odor is felt so that they are not always satisfactory for producing solid preparations for oral administration. After extensive search for substances pharmaceutically Acceptable as additives for the compound, we have found that the coexistence of acid substance with the compound can significantly resist its coloration in various preparations including solid preparations. As acid substances for use in the present invention, those having a dissociation constant pka of 4 or less are suitable.For example, there are given inorganic acids e.g. phosphoric acid, hydrochloric acid , organic acids e.g. citric acid, tartaric acid, maleic acid, fuinaric acid, oxalic acid and acid coating agents e.g.methacrylic acid ethyl acrylate copolymer Eudragit R L30D 55,5 and the like. A suitable atEsunt of coexisting acid substance is e.g. 0.001 to 0.5 mole per mole of the compound, and auounts of 0.005 to 0.2 m m are preferred. When methacrylic acid ethyl acrylate copolymer is used, amounts of 0.01 to 0.5 parts w w based on the compound are suitable. The preparation of the present invention can be produced as follows. For example, solid preparations can be produced by mixing the compound, acid substance and if necessary, appropriate amount of pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle, binding agent, disintegrator, lubricant, etc. and formulating the resulting mixture into tablets, granular preparations, capsules and the like by the usual methods.In this case, for making the acid substance coexist with the compound, the following methods may be used a method in which the compound, vehicles, disintegrators, etc. and acid substance are mixed together in a powdery state to produce a powder for capsules, or the resulting mixture is dry granulated or wetgranulated and a method in which the acid substance, in a liquid state or dissolved or dispersed in combination with a binding agent in a solvent, is mixed with the compound, vehicles, disintegrators and the like to produce liquid preparations, or the resulting mixture is wet granulated. Suitable vehicles include for example starches e.g. corn starch, potato starch , saccharides e.g. milk sugar, cane sugar, grape sugar, mannitol and the like. Suitable binding agents include for example starches e.g. corn starch, potato starch , cellulose derivatives e.g. methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose , synthetic high polymers e.g. polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone and the like. Suitable disintegratols include for example starches e.g. corn starch, potato starch , carboxymethyl cellulose or its calcium salt, low substituted hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and the like. Suitable lubricants include for example magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, stearic acid, talc and the like. The application of the preparation of the present invention is not limited to solid preparations, but preparations such as injections, syrups, emulsions, ointments, creams and suppositories can also be produced by mixing the compound, acid substance and if necessary, pharmaceutically usable dissolution assistants, isotonAc agents, antiseptic agents, buffers, pH regulators, thickening agents, etc. and formulating the resulting mixture by the usual methods. The usefulness of the present invention is illustrated by the following experimental examples and examples. Experimental example 1 4 Carba oyl imidazolium 5 olate hydrate was dissolved in purified water so that its concentration was 0.02 mole liter, and to this aqueous solution was added an organic acid 1 100 m m based on said hydrate . 20 Milliliters of this solution was tight sealed in a glass bottle and stored at 50 0C for 4 days, and the degree of coloration was visually observed.
