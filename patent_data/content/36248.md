# Motor voltage feedback for a servo motor control system.

## Abstract
In a pulse width modulated servo motor control system, a signal indicative of the average terminal voltage of the servo motor 10 is fed back to stabilize the response of the control system. Under normal conditions the feedback signal is rep resentative of the velocity of the servo motor output shaft and thereby operates to stabilize the control system response as a function of the output shaft velocity. Under adverse condi tions tending to increase the power supplied to the motor, the feedback signal increases in a manner to limit the power supplied to the motor and to maintain the control system bandwidth substantially constant.
