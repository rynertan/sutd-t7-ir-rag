More specifically, the conductive mid portion comprises by weight 100 parts polyolefin, 25 parts carbon, 5 parts each pitch fiber and glass fiber and 1 part fumed silica powder. The extruded material can be hot formed and can be dimpled. The electrochemical construction in which the electrodes of the invention may be used can be provided with a protective current in order to reduce or eliminate parasitic shunt currents in common electrolyte systems of this type. The said electrochemical construction may be a zinc bromine electrochemical system which may include a leak and impact resistant constructions comprising The first electrolyte is generally the catholyte for the system, while the second electrolyte is generally the anolyte. The bromine rich phase is a non aqueous phase which separates from the aqueous catholyte and contains bromine complexing agents. The compartment and casing materials are generally comprised of chemically inert, impact resistant plastics. It is an object of the present invention to provide a cost efficient electrode suitable for use in an electrochemical cell e.g. of the said zinc bromine type . The invention is now further described with reference to embodiments thereof and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 6a is a side view of the integral separator spacer depicted in Figure 6 Referring to Figure 1, a schematic diagram of a typical circulating, bipolar zinc bromine system is shown. The zinc bromine system of Figure 1 comprises two electrolytes which are circulated through separate compartments 8, 9 respectively, of the cell 10. An anolyte which is generally stored in reservoir 11 is pumped via pump 12 through compartment 8 and loop 13, generally referred to as the anode loop. A catholyte which is generally stored in reservoir 14, is pumped via pump 15 through compartment 9 and loop 16, generally referred to as the cathode loop. The zinc bromine system is also a two phase system, in that the catholyte has bromine complexing agents and is comprised of a first aqueous phase and a second, non aqueous, bromine rich phase. The bromine rich complexed phase tends to separate at the bromine active electrode 17 from the aqueous catholyte. This non aqueous phase is stored in the reservoir 14, as illustrated schematically by shaded portion 14a. A separator 18 delinates and defines the boundary between the anolyte and cathode compartments 8 and 9, respectively. The separator 18 is a membrane which prevents or binders movement of anions such as the bromide and tribromide ions from cathode compartment 9 to the anode compartment 8. In a bipolar design, the zinc active electrode 19 and the bromine active electrode 17 are opposite sides of the same electrode structure. Further description of the zinc bromine system can be obtained with reference to aforementioned US A 4,105,829 issued August 8, 1978. The zinc bromine system can be made more practicable by integrating and improving various components of Figure 1, as will be hereinafter explained with respect to the construction shown in Figures 2 through 7. Where applicable within the description, like components may have similar numerical designations for the sake of brevity. Now referring to Figure 2, an improved electrochemical system is shown in a schematic perspective view. The improved system utilizes an integrated two leaved separator spacer as described and claimed in EP A 0203656 and an electrode according to the invention forming the portion of a stack of cells, as depicted in the exploded view of Figure 3. The electrochemical system of Figure 2, comprises a battery stack 25 which in turn is comprised of a plurality of cells 10, each having two plates, as shown in Figure 3. One plate is an integral separator spacer 28 according to EP A 0203656 and the other plate is an electrode sheet 29 according to the invention. The separator spacer has two functions combined in a single sheet. The first purpose is that of the separator 18 in Figure 1, i.e. to provide fluid communication between compartments as a membrane. A more detailed description of this function can be obtained from the above mentioned US A 4,105,829 issued August 8, 1978 and also from US A 4,259,417 issued March 31, 1981 for an Ionic Barrier , to inventors R. J. Bellows and P. G. Grimes. The second function of sheet 28 is to space the sheet 28 from the adjacent electrode sheets 29 so as to create respective anolyte and catholyte compartments 8 and 9 Figure 1 . The separator spacer sheet 28 has a microporous mid portion surface 30 which is recessed from the non porous surface 31 of the sides, as shown in more detail in Figures 6 and 6a. When the separator spacer sheets 28 are pressed between electrode sheets 29, the stack structure 25 is formed, as shown in Figure 2. The projections 32 on the microporous mid portion surfaces are designed to maintain a spaced compartmental distance between the separator spacer surface 30 and the flat conductive surfaces 33 of adjacent electrode sheet 29. The projections 32 provide structural means against collapse of surfaces 33 upon surfaces 30 and vice versa. The projections 32 on one side 30 of sheet 28 are diametrically opposite corresponding projections 32 on the opposite side 30 of sheet 28 as clearly illustrated in Figure 6a. This is done, to provide a greater strength against distortion of surfaces 33 upon surfaces 30. The projections 32 usually are designed as pebbles as depicted by arrows 32a in Figure 6a, and as also shown in Figures 7cc and 7dd, etc. These projections 32 may also be designed with a rod shape as depicted in Figures 7a, 7aa and 7b, 7bb by arrows 32b. The projections 32 may also be a combination of pebble and rod shaped protuberances as depicted in Figures 7c, 7cc and 7d, 7dd. The design of these projections allow for an expeditious flow of electrolyte through the compartments 8 and 9, respectively. The flow of electrolyte is accomplished without entrapping gas bubbles about projections 32 within the compartmental cavities 8 and 9. The mid portion of the separator spacer sheet 28 can be comprised of a microporous membrane material known as Daramic The separator sheets 28 and electrode sheets 29 are assembled by means of hollow male female connectors 40 shown in detail in Figures 6 and 6a. When the sheets 28 and 29 are assembled in a stack 25, these hollow connectors 40 form electrolyte manifolds which supply compartments 8 and 9 with electrolyte via individual conduits or channels 60. The male female connectors 40 of sheets 28 fit through the holes 41 Figures 4 and 4a in adjacent sheets 29, and snap into mating connectors 40 in subsequently adjacent sheets 28. The electrode sheet 29 of Figures 4 and 4a is comprised of a coextruded sheet of plastics material which has an electrically conductive mid portion 33 and two side portions 37 of electrically non conductive insulating plastic. The top and bottom side portions 37 are co extruded side by side along with the mid portion 33 to form a one piece continuous electrode sheet, which continuous sheet is then cut to specific lengths to form a plurality of smaller sheets 29. The edges 38 of sheet 29 are undercut to improve electrical isolation in stack 25. This side by side profile co extrusion of insulating and conductive plastics sheets 37 and 33, respectively, presents a new and an alternative fast method of production for all monopolar and bipolar electrodes including electrodes for zinc bromine batteries. Compared with compression molding, the co extrusion method gives more uniformity in thickness, a stronger bonding between the insulating and conductive plastics materials, much desired flatness and electrode by yards similar to dress fabrics. The fabrication cost is much lower because the process is continuous. A special formulation of carbon plastics material is needed for mid portion 33 of sheet 29 to provide good electrical conductivity, but which still exhibits good extrudibility, good strength, and excellent anti corrosive properties against bromine and zinc bromide in the electrolyte. The preferred composition of the conductive carbon plastic is covered by aforementioned US A 4,169,816 issued October 2, 1979, to H.C. Tsien. This formulation gives good conductivity 1 to 2 ohm cm in resistivity , good flex strength, low permeability inertness to bromine, good extrudibility, better weld ability and less mold shrinkage. The conductive plastics material is a mixture of 100 parts by weight of polyolefin copolymer, 25 parts by weight of special conductive carbon, 5 parts by weight each of carbon fiber and glass fiber, and 1 part by weight of fumed silica powder. Some of the other advantages of coextruding the sections 33 and 37 are Figures 5a, 5b and 5c are respective top, front and side views of an extrusion die used to fabricate the electrode sheet. The center extrusion die 47 receives conductive plastics material from a horizontal extruder through conduit 46, while the side extrusion dies 48, each receive non conducting plastics material from an overhead, vertical extruder via conduits 45a and 45b, respectively. The horizontal extruder for the black conductive plastic is a 2 1 2 6.35cm screw with L D of 30 1, while the vertical extruder for the opaque insulating plastic is a 1 1 2 3.81cm dia. screw with L D of 24 1. The melted insulating plastics material enters into the die at 90 degrees from the vertical stream 45, divides into two streams 45a and 45b and flows into one left and one right separate coat hangers along side the main coat hanger 45. The die design is conventional, except that the side by side profile division is believed to be novel. The die is of split construction in order to facilitate any changes in the design and the ease of fabrication. The main die assembly consists of a lower die body 55, upper die body 56, flexible upper lip 57 and fixed lower lip 58. The die lip gap is ground to allow for the swell of plastics emerging out of the die. Lip gaps can be individually adjusted by screws 59 in conjunction with the nut bars 61. The two side members 62 and 63 close the two outsides of flow channels of the insulating plastics materials and give a box like reinforcement. Adapter 64 provides connection to the main extruder. There are 16 cartridge heaters 65 and 4 band heaters 66 for heating the two streams of plastics materials. Temperatures are controlled through the thermocouples and individual zone temperature controllers. The individual adjustment of the left and right streams 45a and 45b is made possible by ball headed adjusting screws 67 and locknut 68. Bushings 74 make good connection from valve blocks 75 to die block 56. All main parts of the die are made of A2 air hardened tool steel. The Bethelehem A2 air hardening steel has the following physical properties With the head pressures from the extruders well over 1000 psi 6.895 Pa , the die cannot operate free from internal leakage between the insulating and conducting streams if the die is in the soft annealed condition. The hardened and reground die eliminates internal leakage. Four different types of insulating plastics materials were tried, they are Both Exxon homopolymer PP5011 and 5052 can match well with the conductive plastics. They came out of the die with no wrinkles, the sheets were flat and uniform. Theoretically, aside from previous considerations, any polyethylene or polypropylene for side portions 37 can be a good match with the conductive plastic mid portion 33, because the basic material used in the conductive plastics is the copolymer of the two. The melting points are in the range of 325 to 375 F 162.7 to 190.6 C . Therefore, approximately 400 F 204.4 C is a proper temperature in range for the two streams to meet. Head pressures are 1500 to 1800 psi 10.3 to 12.4 Pa . These conditions made a good bond at the bonding line. Close match of melt indices is necessary in order to eliminate scallops formed at the joint of the two edges. The viscosities and velocities of the streams from the two extruders need to be very closely equal. Pressures can be manipulated from two heads while varying the temperatures in various die zones to get the matching conditions. However, the differences between melt flow indices of conductive and insulating plastics have to be minimized. The extrusion speed can be around 20 ft. 6.1m minute to 90 ft. 27.4m minute. There are many downstream attachments that can be added so that the co extruded sheet can be worked on while still hot and soft. Thus, the repeated heating and cooling cycles with the accompanied plastics degradations can be eliminated. Powder of activated carbon can be sprayed on one face of the carbon plastics as the sheet is emerging from the die and before the sheet is pinched by the cold nip rolls. The powder spray is limited in the conductive area. Various types of surface finishes can be obtained by changing the nip rolls from polished chrome plated surface to Teflon coated and rubber rolls. It is also possible to replace nip rolls with dimpling rolls, so that cavities or special flow patterns can be formed on one or both faces of the co extruded sheet. The hot forming rolls can make repeated patterns of design indentations in the electrode, if so desired. The combination possibilities are only limited by imagination. For dimpling, the design is also repeated every revolution of the dimpling rolls. It is very much like printing repeated patterns on textile fabric. These downstream modifications such as catalyst spraying, dimpling, or hot forming can be added so that all operations can be done without significant added production cost. Figure 5 is a schematic perspective view of the continuous electrode sheet emerging from the split die illustrated in Figures 5a, 5b and 5c. Now referring to Figure 2 and for the sake of completeness of explanation, a further safety feature for the electrochemical system of EP A 0203659 is illustrated. In order to prevent or reduce the risk of spilling corrosive bromine and bromine compounds in the event of casing or compartmental rupture, the various compartments can be nested with the bromine containing compartment 50 being the most internal compartment. The bromine compartment 50 is surrounded by the catholyte containing compartment 51, which in turn is surrounded by the anolyte containing compartment 52. Compartments 50, 51, and 52 are all enclosed by outer casing 53. Shunt currents can be eliminated along formed manifolds connectors 40 by applying a protective current along these electrolyte carrying conduits, in accordance with the teachings expressed in aforementioned US A 4,197,169 issued April 8, 1980 to M. Zahn, P. G. Grimes and R. J. Bellows. The two leaved electrochemical cell construction reduces parts and is easier to fabricate and assemble than prior systems of this kind. Further modifications to the electrode of the invention within the scope of the appended claims, may occur to those skilled practitioners of this art. Such modifications have not been described for the sake of brevity. Other preferred features of the electrode of the invention, which features may be taken individually or in combination, are
