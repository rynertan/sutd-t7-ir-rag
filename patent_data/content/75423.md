# Belt synchronous check system for a line printer.

## Abstract
A line printer comprises a standard type belt 1 having a plurality of character sets 2 , clock CL marks for individual characters, and home position HP marks for each character set. Further, the line printer comprises a belt image memory 13 for storing the character codes of the characters of the type belt 1 . Flag bits are inserted at positions of the belt image mem ory 13 corresponding to home positions of the character sets 2 . The output HP D of the belt image memory 13 is compared with the output HP of the type belt 1 to perform a belt synchronous check.
