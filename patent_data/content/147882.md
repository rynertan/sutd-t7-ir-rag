# Deflection coil system for a picture display tube.

## Abstract
The deflection coil system 7 comprises a synthetic resin support 9 which on its outside is surrounded by an annular ferromagnetic core 19 having toroidal deflection coils 21 . On the rear portion 11 of the support 9 outwardly directed resilient members 23 which extend approximately perpendicularly to the axis 25 of the support are formed having on their forwardly directed side a face 27 which is inclined with respect to said axis. The faces 27 engage the rear side of the core 19 so that each member 23 on the core on the one hand exerts a radially outwardly directed force 29 centring the core with respect to the axis 25 and on the other hand an axially forwardly directed force 31 urging the core against an abutment 33 on the front of the support 9 . Separate components for positioning the core 9 are hence are not necessary. If desired the core 19 after assembly may be permanently connected to the support 9 by means of a few drops of adhesive 35 .
