The present invention also provides a process for the production of a compound of formula I as defined above, comprising replacing the moiety HC Y in a compound of formula II,EMI4.1 wherein R6 and X are as defined above, and HC Y is i formyl, ii a radical of formulaEMI4.2 or iii a radical of formulaEMI4.3 wherein 2 and Z are independently oxy gen or NR1, and h to 35 are as defined above, by a moiety of formula III, EMI5.1 wherein RI to R5 are as defined above. The process may be effected in conventional manner for analogous dihydropyridine syntheses, e.g.according to Hantzsch. When the moiety HC Y is formyl and when it is desired to produce a compound of formulaI, wherein R2 is identical to R5 and R3 is identical toR4, it is convenient to react a compound of formula II with a compound of formula IV, R5CC CH 2ffiCfl R4 IV wherein R4 and R5 are as defined above, in the presence of a compound of formula V, H2NR1 V wherein R1 is as defined above. Preferably at least 2 moles of a compound of formula IV per mole of a compound of formula II are present. Alternatively a compound of formula II may be reacted with a compound of formula VI, R5 C NH RI CH CO R4 VI wherein R1, R4 and R5 are as defined above. Preferably at least 2 moles of a compound of fo mula VI per mole of a compound of formula II are present.Preferably also R1 is hydrogen. When the moiety HC Y is formyl and preferably when it is desired to produce a compound of formula I wherein R2 is different to R5 and or R3 is different to R4, it is also possible to react such a compound of formulaII with a compound of formula IV and a compound of formula VII, R2 C NH R1 CH CO R3 VII wherein R2, R1 and R3 are as defined above. It will be appreciated that a compound of formulaVI may be formed as an intermediate during the reaction of a compound of formula IV and a compound of formula V. A compound of formula II, wherein HC Y is a radical ii or iii , may be formed as an intermediate in the above reactions. They may however be produced by different processes. Alternatively or particularly for the production of a compound of formula I, wherein R2 is different to R5 and or R3 is different to R4, it is convenient to react a compound of formula II, wherein the moiety HC Y is a radical ii with a compound of formula IV or VI, and where appropriate, with a compound of formula V. A compound of formula II, wherein the moiety HC Y is a radical iii may be an intermediate. In the above reactions it is possible in certain instances when R2, R3, R4 and R5 are not identical that more than one isomer of formula I may be formed. If so these may be separated in conventional manner, e.g. by thin layer chromatography. When the starting material is a compound of formula II, wherein HC Y is a radical iii , the reaction is a ring cyclisation. When Z and Z are both oxygen, then an amine of formula V should be present. However, all the above reactions may be effected under the same conditions. The reaction may be effected conveniently in solution. A suitable solvent is water, ethanol, dioxane, dimethyl formamide, dimethyl sulphoxide, pyridine or glacial acetic acid. Suitable reaction temperatures may be from 20 to 1600 C, preferably from 60 to 1200 C. Insofar as the production of starting materials is not particularly described these compounds are known or may be produced in analogous manner to known compounds.
