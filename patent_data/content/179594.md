# Video signal processing.

## Abstract
High definition video signal are produced using proces sing equipment incorporating a unit 1 with two vertical aperture circuits 5 and 6 and an interpolator 7, the former taking the signals A and C, passing them through a summation amplifier 8 and a divide by two invertor 9. After combining this signal with B at summation amplifier 10, the output signal B which represents the vertical detail signal of B as compared to the signals A and C is passed through a noise coring circuit 11 and any resulting output output added to B at summation amplifier 13 to produce a signal B with enhanced vertical detail. Then signals B and C the latter formed by circuit 6 are averaged and alternately connected to the output of unit 1, thereby to produce a high definition video signal.
