# Method for stabilizing extra chromosomal elements in bacteria during cultivation, extra chromosomal elements, transformed bacteria and a method of producing a desired product in transformed bacteria.

## Abstract
A novel method for stabilization of extra chromosomal elements in bacteria during cultivation without use of antibiotics in the medium has been developed. The method comprises transformation of a host bacterium having a defect in a chromosomal gene needed for the synthesis or maintenance of the cell envelope with an extra chromosomal element capable of suppressing the require ment caused by the chromosomal gene defect of the host bacterium. The invention furthermore provides for such transformed bacteria and stabilized extra chromosomal ele ments and for a method for producing desirable products by inserting a gene for the desirable product into a stabilized extra chromosomal element and cultivation of suitable host bacteria containing the stabilized extra chromosomal ele ment comprising the gene for the desirable product. It was demonstrated that according to the principles of this method, a plasmid including the dal gene of Bacillus subtilis and a gene encoding a desirable product can be maintained in an appropriate dal B. subtilis host in conventional media. The method thus allows for improved product yield and quality.
