# CARTRIDGE FOR HOLDING MASTIC OR SIMILAR MATERIAL IN AN APPLICATOR GUN

## Abstract
A cartridge for holding mastic or similar material in the barrel 100 of an applicator gun consists of an open ended hollow cylindrical member or sleeve 1 having a bore 10 therethrough which receives a piston 2 slidable in the bore in either direction. With the piston 2 at one end of the bore 10 a body of mastic material M is inserted in the bore at the other end for expulsion by the piston 2 therefrom when the mastic material M is heat softened in the gun. The arrangement is such that after full expulsion of the mastic material M the sleeve 1 can then be either used in a reverse position in the gun barrel 100 with a further body of mastic material M inserted in the sleeve 1 for expulsion by repeat operation of the piston 2 , or the piston 2 can be returned along the bore 10 for similar operation. The piston 2 is preferably retained against movement out of the a sleeve 1 such as by retaining rings 13 at each end of the latter.
