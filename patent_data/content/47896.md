# Single path adjustable flowmeter.

## Abstract
An air flowmeter 10 includes a main air flow passage 26 , a relatively small venturi tube 28 receiving a portion of the air flow, a pressure port 74 for sensing stagnation pressure in the main passage, a pressure port 70 for sensing static pressure in the throat of the venturi, and a complimentary pair of sets of stationary swirl vanes 30, 32 disposed adjacent the outlet of the venturi to impart an air swirl in the main passage, thereby creating a reduced pressure at the venturi outlet for amplifying the pressure difference between the stagnation and static pressures. The sets of swirl vanes are rotationally displaceable with respect to one another, allowing some of the air to bypass the effect of the swirl vanes without being diverted to a separate passageway. This arrangement results in a fluid flowmeter having a characteristic pressure drop which is less than that for a conventional device, particularly at high flow rates.
