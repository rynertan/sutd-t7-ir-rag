# Ventilators and or windows for vehicles.

## Abstract
In a combined ventilator an window with spring load ed arms for installation in the roof of a motor coach, a panel 18 is mounted on angularly movable arms 28 so that the panel 18 can be moved between a closed posi tion, opened positions in which either side of the panel 18 or either and of the panel 18 is opened, and an open position in which the panel 18 is parallel to and spaced from its closed position. The arms 28 are pivotally mount ed on the frame 10 at 38 and have detent means 40 to hold them in their alternative positions. The other ends of the arms 28 are plvotally connected to brackets 46 depending from the panel, the latter pivotal connections being adapted to permit relative movement between the arms 28 and the panel 18 additional to movement about the respective axes of pivotal coupling.
