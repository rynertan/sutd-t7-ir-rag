# Electrohydrodynamic exciter.

## Abstract
An electrohydrodynamic EHD exciter 3 is disclosed for promoting the formation of droplets 26 from a column 1 of electrically conductive fluid emitted under pressure from a nozzle 2 . The exciter is composed of one, two, three or more pump electroes 8 9 10 of a length equal to about one half the droplet spacing 5 . Multiple pump electrode embodi ments are spaced at intervals of multiples of about one half the droplet spacing or wavelength 5 . The exciter may be used in an ink jet printing system of the type wherein selected droplets 26 from a continuous stream of droplets are charged and deflected toward a target. The droplet placement on the target is determined by the amount of charge.
