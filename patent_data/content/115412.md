# COATING FOR ELECTRONIC SUBSTRATE

## Abstract
A coated substrate for use in the manufacture of an electronic device is made by providing a substrate with an adherent coating. The coating is provided by thermally spraying material onto the substrate, for example by plasma spraying particles of a mixture of oxides of size 2 to 30 Âµm onto a metallic substrate, to give a coating having controlled properties for electronic purposes, for example, in respect of high dielectric strength, surface roughness and chemistry. An electronic circuit may be applied to the coated substrate by methods known in the art such as screen printing. Very satisfactory voltage break down characteristics are obtained also, the substrate need not necessarily be subjected to a possibly deleterious heat treatment.
