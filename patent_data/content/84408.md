A tremendous amount of research in the synthetic organic chemistry, pharmacology and clinical medicine of prostaglandins has been performed since the discovery of prostaglandins. In 1976, J. R. Vane et al. reported the isolation and biological effect of prostacyclin prostaglandin I2 S. Moncada, R. Gryglewski, SBunting, and J. R. Vane, Nature London , 263, 633 1976 l. Prostaglandin 12 III , which is shown below, has several excellent pharmacological activities, for example, hypotensive, vasodilating, antiallergic, antiulcerogenic, antisecretory, and antithrombotic activities, and is expected to be useful in treating and preventing hypertention, asthma, ulcer,EMI7.1 peripheral arterial diseases, cerebral ischemic attacks, myocardial infarcts and strokes, atherosclerosis arteriosclerosis and post operative thrombosis. However, the short half life and chemical instability of prostaglandin I2 is unsuitable for pharmaceutical use. We have now discovered a series of novel bicyclooctane compounds I of this invention and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, which have potent platelet anti aggregation activity and hypotensive activity and are useful generally in treating and preventing thromboses and in treating hypertension. In addition, the novel bicyclooctane compounds I have potent gastric antisecretory and antiulcerogenic activity and are useful in treating and preventing gastrointestinal ulcer. Furthermore, the novel bicyclooctane compounds I have a greater advantage in their chemical stability and easiness to handle, and hence can be administered even orally. The novel bicyclooctane compounds 13 and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts can effectively be administered orally in tablets, capsules, drops or syrups, or parenterally such as intravenously, subcutaneously, intramuscularly in sterile or suspensions. The exact doses are depending on the age, weight, condition of the patient, the frequency and route of administration. For the puprose of treatment or prevention of thromboses, oral dosages are used in the range about 0.1 to 1000 mg, preferably about 0.1 to 100 mg per day. For the purpose of treatment of ulcer, oral dosages are used in the range about 0.01 100 mg, preferably about 0.1 to 20 mg per day. Accordingly, a basic object of the present invention is to provide novel and stable bicyclooctane compounds I having an antithrombotic activity, antiulcer activity. Another object of this invention is to provide a process for producing those compounds I , These and other objects will be apparent to those skilled in the art to which the present invention pertains from the foregoing and subsequent descriptions. The novel bicyclooctane compounds I of this invention can be prepared by the following methods Method a The novel bicyclooctane compounds of the formula 13 EMI9.1 wherein R1, R2, A, B, D, X, Yl, Y2 and Y3 are as defined above, can be preared by reacting a carbonyl compound of the formula IV EMI9.2 wherein R2, A, B, D and X are as defined above, and Y1 , Y2 and Y3 are independently of each other a free or a protected hydroxy group, with a compound of the formula V Ph 3P CH CH2 3 CO2M V wherein M is a hydrogen atom or an alkali metal, for example, sodium, lithium or potassium, preferably sodium, and Ph is a phenyl group, and if necessary, subsequently one or more of the following reactions are carried out at any appropriate step in any desired sequence 1 separation of a mixture of isomers, 2 deprotection of a protected hydroxy group, 3 protection of a free hydroxy group, 4 esterification of carboxyl group, 5 hydrolysis of an esterified carboxy group.Method b The novel bicyclooctane compounds of the formula I , in which X represents trans vinylene group, may be also prepared by reacting an aldehyde compound of the formula VI EMI10.1 wherein Y3 is as defined above, and R11 represents a C1 C4 alkyl group, with a compound of the formula VII EMI10.2 wherein A, B and D are each as defined above, and Y2 is a free or a protected hydroxy group which may be easily replaced with a hydrogen by acidic conditions, and further reacting the carbonyl group of the resulting enone VIII EMI11.1 wherein R1,, A, B, D, Y2 and Y3 are each as defined above, with a reducing agent or an organometallic compound of the formula IX M R2 IX wherein R2 is a C1C5 alkyl group and M is a lithium atom or Mg halo halo is a halogen atom , and if necessary, subsequently one or more of the following reactions are carried out at any appropriate step in any desired sequence 1 separation of a mixture of isomers, 2 deprotection of a protected hydroxy group, 3 protection of a free hydroxy group, 4 hydrolysis of an esterified carboxy group. In the significances of the formula VII , examples of the hydroxy protecting group which may be removed by acidic conditions, include 1 trisubstituted silyl, for example trimethylsilyl, triethylsilyl, tri nbutylsilyl, tert butyldimethylsilyl, tribenzylsilyl, or triphenylsilyl, 2 5 or 6 membered heterocyclic groups having an oxygen or sulphur atom in the ring, for example 2 tetrahydrofuranyl, 2 tetrahydropyranyl, or 2 tetrahydrothiopyranyl, 3 a lower alkyl group having one or more alkoxy or aralkoxy substituents, for example methoxymethyl, l ethoxyethyl, 2 methoxy 2 propyl, or 2 methoxyethoxymethyl 4 trityl group. The Wittig reagents V and VII can be prepared according to the knownmethod E. J. Corey et al.,J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 91 5675 1969 . The Wittig reaction can be carried out in a known manner in the presence of a solvent using 1 10 equivalents preferably 2 6 equivalents of the Wittig reagent Vl and VII . Examples of the solvent are ethers e.g. diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dimethoxyethane , hydrocarbons e.g. benzene, toluene, hexane , N,N dimethylformamide and dimethylsulfoxide. The reaction can be controlled with warming or cooling, usually at a temperature from OOC to the boiling point of solvent, preferably at room temperature, depending upon the extent of the progress. The reaction time may vary depending upon the reaction temperature and the reagent to be used therein but it generally takes 1 24 hrs. The carbonyl compound VIII can be converted into the corresponding alcohol compound by reacting the former with a reducing agent or an organometallic compound IX . For reduction, there may be used any known reducing agent which can reduce only ketonic carbonyl group without affecting ester group in an inert solvent e.g. diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dimethoxyethane, pentane, hexane, benzene, toluene, methanol, ethanol at a temperature ranging from 70 C to room temperature. Examples of such reducing agents are metal borohydrides, for example sodium borohydride, potassium borohydride, zinc borohydride, lithium triisobutylborohydride and sodium trimethoxyborohydride, metal aluminum hydrides, for example lithium tri tert butoxy aluminum hydride, lithium ethoxy l,l binaphthyl 2, 2 dioxyaluminum hydride, and aluminum alkoxides such as aluminum isopropoxide and diisobutylaluminum 2,6 ditert butyl 4 methylphenoxide. The reaction conditions may vary depending upon the reaction temperature and the reducing agent to be used therein, but the reaction may be preferably carried out at a temperature from 700C to OOC, using 1 to 3 equivalents of reducing agents. For alkylation, the reaction may be carried out with 1 to 5 equivalents of organometallic compound of the formula IX , at a temperature from 70 C to room temperature in an inert solvent e.g. ethers for example diethylether, tetrahydrofuran, and dimethoxyethane or hydrocarbons for example benzene, toluene, and hexane . The organometallic compound IX can be usually prepared from the corresponding halide by the conventional procedures. The bicyclooctane compound thus obtained can be separated from the reaction mixture and purified by the conventional procedures, for example column or thin layer chromatography and optionally followed by esterification of a carboxy group, hydrolysis of an esterified carboxy group, protection of a free hydroxy group, or deprotection of protected hydroxy group. The esterification of carboxy group, hydrolysis of ester group, protection of a free hydroxy group or deprotection of protected hydroxy group can be carried out by the conventional procedures ProtectiveGroup in Organic Chemistry, edited by J.
