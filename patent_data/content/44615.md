# Method for the analysis of triglycerides.

## Abstract
A method of analysis of triglycerides in biological fluids includes removing or compensating for endogenous glycer ol and pyruvate interferences, and then enzymatically hyd rolyzing the triglycerides using microbial lipase and a surfactant, the amount of glycerol so produced being determined. Preferably, the interferences are removed en zymatically. The preferred combination of enzymes for removing glycerol and pyruvate comprises glycerol kinase and adenosine triphosphate, pyruvate kinase and phos phoenol pyruvate, and alanine aminotransferase and gluta mate.
