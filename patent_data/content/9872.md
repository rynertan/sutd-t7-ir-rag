## Abstract
An antigenic protein, termed antigen A, present on the cell walls and in cultures of Streptococcus mutans, especially genetic group I serotypes c, e and f is separated from other antigenic proteins, notably those which cross react with heart tissue, to give an antigenic preparation which may be used as a vaccine or to raise antibodies for use in protecting against dental caries. Antigen A is one of two major antigenic proteins remain ing on cell walls of S. mutans genetic group I after extraction with a boiling 10 g l litre aqueous solution of sodium dodecyl sulphate for 20 minutes. It has a molecular weight of about 29,000, an isoelectric point of 4.1 to 4.5. Its amino acid analysis is also given. The antigen also occurs in the culture filtrate and or cell extract and may be readily purified from these sources by, for example fractional ammonium sulphate precipitation and or affinity chromatography on immobilised antibody. Pharmacological or dental preparations containing the antigen preparation or abtibodies thereto.
