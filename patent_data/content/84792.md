# Non invasive diagnosis method.

## Abstract
This invention provides a method for performing a simple sweat test with particular use in the screen testing for cystic fibrosis. The method includes the use of an iontophoretic de vice adapted for ambulatory use which has a self adhesive drug impregnated electrode for the stimulation of sweat cou pled with the subsequent use of a test patch device for per forming the analysis of the sweat in situ. For cystic fibrosis di agnosis, the test patch is particularly adapted to determine chloride concentration in the sweat when the concentration exceeds a predetermined level.
