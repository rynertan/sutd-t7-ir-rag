# Process for preparing vanadyl phthalocyanine.

## Abstract
A process comprising reacting vanadium pentoxide with phthalonitrile and an alcohol at least at an exotherm tempera ture with agitation, filtering the resulting reaction mixture to form a reaction product pigment cake, washing the reaction product pigment cake at least once with a dipolar aprotic sol vent to form a treated pigment cake, drying the treated pig ment cake, leaching with agitation the treated pigment cake with a strong acid diluted with water, filtering the resulting mix ture to form a leached pigment cake, washing the leached pig ment cake at least once with a strong acid diluted with water to form a washed leached pigment cake, washing the leached pigment cake at least once with a solvent comprising water to form a water washed leached pigment cake, forming a strong base slurry by combining the washed leached pigment cake with a strong base diluted with water, heating the strong base slurry with agitation, filtering the resulting mixture to form a strong base treated pigment cake, forming a solvent slurry by combining the strong base treated pigment cake with a dipolar aprotic solvent, heating the solvent slurry with agitation, filter ing the solvent slurry to obtain a solvent treated pigment cake, forming an aqueous slurry by combining the solvent treated pigment cake with a solvent comprising water, heating the aqueous slurry with agitation, filtering the aqueous slurry to obtain a washed pigment cake, drying the washed pigment cake, incrementally dissolving with agitation the washed pigment cake in a cilled strong acid to form a chilled solution of vanadyl phthalocyanine, incrementally combining with agitation the solution with chilled water to form a mixture comprising precipitated vanadyl phthalocyanine particles, filtering the resulting mixture to obtain a cake of precipitated vanadyl phthalocyanine particles, forming an aqueous slurry by combining the cake of precipitated vanadyl phthalocyanine particles with a solvent comprising water to a form a vanadyl phthalocyanine particle water slurry, heating the vanadyl phthalocyanine particle water slurry, filtering the resulting mixture to obtain a cake of vanadyl phthalocyanine particles, forming an aqueous slurry by combining the cake of precipated vanadyl phthalocyanine particles with a solvent comprising water to form a vanadyl phthalocyanine particle water slurry heating the vanadyl phthalocyanine particle water slurry filtering the resulting mixture to obtain a cake of vanadyl phthalocyanine particles forming a water slurry by combining the cake of vanadyl phthalocyanine particles with water filtering the water slurry to form a purified pigment cake of vanadyl phthalocyanine and drying the purified pigment cake of vanadyl phthalocyanine.
