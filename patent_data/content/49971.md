There should also be listed the acid addition salts of all the preceding compounds in List B. The following is a sequence utilized to prepare the compounds concerned in this invention. EMI8.1 The synthetic secuence outlined above is unique in its ability to produce V and VI . No directed syntheses of either of these classes of compounds has been reported in the literature. The reactions involving the sodium hydride and acetyl chloride can be carried out in an inert solvent at a temperature from about O0, to about 10 C the reaction of the pyrone with the diazonium salt can be carried out at a temperature from about 0 to about 50 C and the decarboxylation using sulfuric acid can be carried out in an inert atmosphere from about 200 to 25O0C. In the above reaction sequence a 3 oxoglutarate is first reacted with sodium hydride thereby replacing a hydrogen atom from the active methylene group followed by reaction with acetyl chloride to form the intermediate of Formula II which then rearranges under acid conditions to form the pyrone of Formula III.The pyrone is then reacted with a diazonium salt to form a hydrazone of Formula IV. The hydrazone is then rearranged in the presence of a base to form the dรญcarboxypyridazine of Formula V which is then decarboxylated under acidic conditions to form the 5 carboxypyridazine of Formula VI. A more preferred synthetio route to compounds ofFormula I is outlined below.EMI9.1 In this approach the 3 oxoglutarate is first reacted with a diazonium salt to form the hydrazone ofFormula VII which is then reacted with isopropyl magnesium chloride followed by reaction with acetyl chloride to form the dicarboxypyridazine ester ofFormula VIII which is then hydrolyzed to the corresponding acid of Formula IX. Decarboxylation under strongly acidic conditions as described above will again form the monocarboxy pyridazine of Formula VI. The following preparations are provided to illustrate the processes for preparing the compounds of Formula I.There may also be used other processes described in the literature for the preparation of analagous compounds such as processes described in Belgian Patent No.864,704 and its foreign equivalents cited earlier. In the following preparations temperatures are in degrees Celsius and percentages are on a weight basis unless otherwise specified.Synthesis of 6 methyl 5 methoxycarbonyl 4 hydroxy 2 pyrone Via dimethyl 2 acetyl 3 oxoglutarate A 3 liter, three necked, round bottomed flask was equipped with addition funnel, paddle stirrer and thermometer.

The compounds of Formula I are particularly useful as chemical hybridization agents in gramineous crops, such as wheat, barley, maize, rice, sorghum, millets, oats, rye, triticale, forage crops and the like. When used as chemical hybridization agents, the compounds induce a selective male sterility without also inducing unacceptable female sterility in the treated plants and without causing unacceptable phytotoxicity towards the treated plants. As used herein, the term male sterility includes both actual male sterility, as evidenced by a lack of male flower parts or by sterile pollen, and functional male sterility, in which the male flower parts are unable to cause pollination.The compounds also cause other plant growth regulatory responses, such as, for example, control of flowering, control of fruiting and inhibition of seed formation in non cereal species and other related growth regulatory responses. Where, in the compounds of Formula I , male sterility is accompanied by some female infertility and or phytotoxicity, the compounds are still of utility in producing new plant hybrids or in the production of ergot for which see French PublishedPatent Application No.2400832. The compounds of Formula I may be used as plant growth regulators in the manner and at doses described in Belgian Patent No.864,704 and its foreign equivalents listed earlier. The compounds of FormulaI may also be formulated, with such changes as are dictated by the solubities and other characteristics of the compounds in question, as described in theBelgian Patent or its equivalents. The compounds of Formula I may be used singly or in admixture or may be used in conjunction with other types of plant growth regulators or with different types of agricultural chemicals as described in the Belgian patent and its equivalents. Formulations usually include one or more of the compounds of Formula I , e.g. in an amount from 1 99 by weight, and an agronomically acceptable carrier or diluent. Of course, reference in the last three paragraphs and elsewhere in this specification unless the context requires otherwise to compounds of Formula I includes the acid addition salts.

An awned variety Fielder and an awnless variety Mayo 64 of spring wheat are planted at the rate of 6 to 8 seeds per 6 inch pot containing a sterile medium of 3 parts soil and 1 part humus. The plants are grown under short day 9 hour conditions for the first 4 weeks to obtain good vegetative growth before flower initiation. The plants are then moved to long day 16 hour conditions which are provided by high intensity lights in the greenhouse. The plants are fertilized at 2,4, and 8 weeks after planting with a water soluble fertilizer 16 25 16 at the rate of 1 tsp gal of water, and are frequently sprayed with isotox for aphid control and dusted with sulfur for powdery mildew control. Test compounds are foliarly applied to the awned female plants when these plants reach the flag leaf emergence stage stage 8 on Feekes scale . All compounds are applied in various concentrations.in an aqueous carrier containing if necessary, an organic solvent and conventional surfactant . The carrier volume is 50 gal A acre in all cases. A typical usable surfactant is that sold as TRITON XlOO used at a rate of 2oz gal of carrier. After spike emergence but before anthesis, 4 to 6 spikes per pot are bagged to prevent outcrossing. At the first signs of flower opening, two spikes per pot are cross pollinated, using the approach method, with the awnless male parent. As soon as the seeds become plainly visible, spike length is measured and seeds per spike let counted in boh bagged and crossed spikes. Male sterility can then be calculated as percent inhibition of seed set in bagged spikes of treated plants, and female fertility in crossed spikes can be calculated as percent of control seed set. After maturity the seed on crossed spikes can be planted for determination of percent hybridization. Where applicable,percent sterility, percent fertility, and percent height inhibition are calculated from the following formulas a. Sterility Sc St Sc x 100 5c seeds spikelet in bagged spikes of control plants. St seeds spikelet in bagged spikes of treated plants. b. Fertility Ft FC x 100 Ft seeds spikelet in approach crossed spikes of treated plants F seeds spikelet in unbagged spikes of c control plants c. Height inhibition Hc Ht Hc x 100 Hc Height of control plants Ht Height of treated plants Table IV summarizes typical results obtained in the evaluation of compounds of Formula I whereinR3 is hydrogen.
