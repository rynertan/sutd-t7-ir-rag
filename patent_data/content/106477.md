# PROCESS FOR MANUFACTURING SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES COMPRISING AN ELECTROCHEMICAL ETCHING STEP

## Abstract
A procedure is described for producing semiconductor devices having damage free surfaces in electrochemically n type and intrinsic compound semiconductors. The process involves a photoetching procedure including applying a potential to the compound semiconductor while it is in contact with an electrolytic solution and irradiating the surface to be etched with light in a certain energy range. By suitable adjustment in the potential, electrolytic solution composition and light energy, the etch rate is made propor tional to the light intensity. By suitable variation in light intensity and light ray direction, various geometrical features can be made on the surface of the compound semiconduc tor. For example, a hole with straight sides can be made in the compound semiconductor by use of a light spot and parallel collimated light rays. An advantageous application of this process is the fabrication of a photodiode with a hole in the center for use in bidirectional communication systems and to monitor power output for optical communication sources. The advantage of this process is that no damage occurs outside etched hole so that a maximum area of the photodiode remains active for detecting incoming radiation. Another advantage of the process is that etching will stop where the material becomes p type so that etching can be made to stop automatically at a p n junction.
