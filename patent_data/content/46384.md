# A tag.

## Abstract
The invention concerns a tag which may be used as a tamper proof closure for containers but which is preferably for use as an ear tag for animals such as cattle. The tag comprises a strip of material 1 which is bent upon itself to form two limbs 2,3 . One limb 2 has an upstanding hollow tubular rivet 4 which engages with a complementary receiver portion 5 in the opposite limb. The receiver portion 5 has an annular channel shaped recess 6 and an upstanding centre portion 57 . The upstanding centre portion 57 is formed with an an nular flange 60 , which in a preferred embodiment comprises a disc attached by means of a weak spot weld 61 to the up standing centre portion 57 . When the rivet 4 is pressed into engagement with the receiver portion 5 the disc is located within the outer end of the rivet 4 and the outer peripheral edge of the rivet 4 is curled inwardly to engage beneath the disc. The spot weld 61 acts as a weakened zone which will rupture if an attempt is made to prise the engaged limbs apart.
