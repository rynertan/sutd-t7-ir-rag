# An apparatus for recording a color video signal.

## Abstract
An apparatus for recording a color video signal in which a luminance signal and a chrominance signal are recorded on separate channels and at least two chrominance compo nent signals are compressed in timebase and alternately arranged in turn to be recorded on one track as the chrominance signal is disclosed. This apparatus includes timebase compressing and expanding circuits 30 provided respectively for the chrominance component signals and for producing timebase compressed chrominance component signals by writing the chrominance component signals by a first signal and by reading them by a second signal with the frequency integer times as high as that of the first signal and a coupling circuit 45 for simultaneously supplying the chrominance component signals, which are being read out from the output terminals of the timebase compressing and expanding circuits 30 by the second signal, to the input terminals of the timebase compressing and expanding circuits, whereby the timebase compressed chrominance component signals are written in the timebase compressing and expanding circuits by the second signal. In this case, when succeeding chrominance component signals are writ ten in the timebase compressing and expanding circuits by the first signal, the timebase compressed chrominance component signals rewritten in the timebase compressing and expanding circuits are read out therefrom by the first signal so as to produce normal chrominance component signals.
