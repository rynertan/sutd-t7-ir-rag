## Description
CATALYST RESIN PRECURSOR OR PREPOLYMER COMPOSITION This invention relates to organic peroxide resin precursor or prepolymer compositions and in particular to a storage stable, resin peroxide composition comprising a major amount of a resin precursor or prepolymer selected from the group consisting of furfuryl alcohol and polyfurfuryl alcohol resin precursors, and furfuryl alcohol formaldehyde resin, phenolic and urea formaldehyde modified furfuryl alcohol formaldehyde resin, phenolic modified furfuryl alcohol formaldehyde resin, ureaformaldehyde modified furfuryl alcohol formaldehyde resin and phenolic resin prepolymers, and a minor amount of a peroxide. In the foundry industry, sand is coated with resin binders and formed into moulds and cores for the production of precision castings. A wide variety of techniques has been developed for the manufacture of sand cores and moulds. These involve the hot box technique for mould and core formation the shell method the No Bake , and the cold box technique. In the hot box and shell methods, sand moulds and cores are formed by heating a mixture of sand with a thermosetting resin at a temperature of about 3000 to 6000F 150 to 315 C in contact with patterns which produce the desired shape for the mould or core. The resin is polymerized and a core or mould is formed. Procedures of this type are described in Dunn et al. U.S. Patent 3,059,297 and Brown et al. U.S. Patent 3,020,609. A particular disadvantage of the hot box and shell methods is the necessity for heating the pattern boxes to 3000 to 6000 F 150 to 315 C to polymerize and cure the resin binder. This involves considerable expense and is generally a high cost technique. The cold box techniques for core and mould formation involve the use of sand mixed or coated with resins which may be cured at room temperature by acid or base catalysis. Acid or base catalysts have been used in liquid, solid or gaseous form. Typical cold box processes are shown in Blaies U.S. Patent 3,008,205 Dunn et al. U.S. Patent 3,059,297 Peters et al. U.S. Patent 3,108,340 Kottke et al. U.S. Patent 3,145,438 Brown et al. U.S. Patent 3,184,814 Robins U.S. Patent 3,639,654 AustralianPatent 453,160 and British Patent 1 225,984. Many of these processes involve the use of a sulfur containing acid catalyst such as benzene sulfonic acid, toluene sulfonic acid and the like. A few years ago, a process was developed for room temperature polymerization of condensation resins in which an acid curing agent is generated in situ in the resin or on a sand resin mix. It had previously been suggested in U.S. Patent 3,145,438 to inject SO3 in the form of a gas into a mixture of sand and resin to cure the resin at room temperature. It was found, however, that this process causes an instantaneous curing of the resin in the region subjected to treatment by SO3 which impedes the diffusion of this gas to other parts of the resin, particularly the central parts of the mixture. Subsequently, a method was developed which avoided this difficulty. In Richard U.S. Patent 3,879,339, it is disclosed that sand may be coated with a suitable oxidizing agent, such as an organic peroxide, and coated with the resin to be used in binding the sand into the form of a core or mould. The sand resin mixture is then formed into suitable shape and treated with gaseous SO2. The S02 is oxidized, in situ, to SO3 and converted to sulfur containing acid by water present in the mixture.The sulfur containing acid which is generated in situ causes a rapid and uniform polymerization of the resin at room temperature. This process has proved successful commercially and is applicable to phenolic resins, furan resins, and urea formaldehyde resins, as well as mixtures and copolymers thereof. In the cold box method of Richard U.S. Patent 3,879,339, there are a large variety of peroxides disclosed which may be added to sand along with resins which are used in forming sand cores or moulds. This composition is subsequently formed into shape and treated with gaseous SO2. The peroxides which are disclosed in the RichardPatent are mostly quite expensive and, in many cases, are difficult to handle and to ship or transport. Organic peroxides require special approval for transportation in interstate commerce. Organic peroxides are often highly flammable or present other fire hazards. Organic peroxides also are often shock sensitive and may explode or detonate under certain conditions. As a result, any and all organic peroxides can not be used in the Riehard process because of economic and safety consideration. In copending U.S. patent application Serial No.204,330 filed November 5, 1980, an organic peroxide composition is disclosed which is particularly useful in resin polymerization by a process involving gassing with S02. The application makes some reference to the fact that the particular organic peroxide is unexpectedly soluble in certain resins to form storage stable compositions. It is an object of the present invention to provide a new and improved storage stable, easily transportable, non detonating organic peroxide resin composition for use in the polymerization of a resin by gassing with S02. The present invention provides a storage stable, resin peroxide composition comprising a major amount of a resin precursor or prepolymer selected from the group consisting of furfuryl alcohol and polyfurfuryl alcohol resin precursors, and furfuryl alcohol formaldehyde resin, phenolic and urea formaldehyde modified furfuryl alcohol formaldehyde resin, phenolic modified furfuryl alcohol formaldehyde resin, urea formaldehyde modified furfuryl alcohol formaldehyde resin and phenolic resin prepolymers, and a minor amount of a peroxide characterized in that said peroxide comprises a diisopropylbenzene hydroperoxide. The peroxide composition is characterized by its storage stability, resistance to detonation, low flammability, ease of handling and improved catalytic properties in the polymerization of certain resins. The preferred peroxide, based on economic considerations, is a crude mixture, called crude diisopropylbenzene hydroperoxide, of a major amount of diisopropylbenzene monohydroperoxide and a minor amount of diisopropylbenzene dihydroperoxide, together with solvents and unreacted materials obtained as a byproduct in the commercial manufacture of p diisopropylbenzene dihydroperoxide.A particularly stable and useful composition consists of about 20 solvent, preferably cyclohexanone, and 80 of a mixture consisting ofa major part of crude diisopropylbenzene hydroperoxide and a minor part of hydrogen peroxide. The above peroxide composition, and the diisopropylbenzene hydroperoxide, are soluble in or miscible with resin precursors, such as furfuryl alcohol and polyfurfuryl alcohol, and resin prepolymer such as furfuryl alcoholformaldehyde resin, phenolic and or urea formaldehyde modified furfuryl alcohol formaldehyde resin and phenolic resin prepolymers to form storage stable compositions.The peroxide composition and the resin precursor or prepolymer can be added to sand, formed into cores or moulds, and gassed with sulfur dioxide at a temperature from room temperature to about 3000F 1500C for a time of from a fraction of a second, preferably a few seconds, to several minutes to form superior sand cores and moulds. Improved peroxide compositions of the invention are particularly useful in the process of Richard U.S.Patent 3,879,339. The peroxide composition consists of a solution or mixture of diisopropylbenzene monohydroperoxide or a crude composition containing diisopropylbenzene monohydroperoxide and diisopropylbenzene dihydroperoxide, called crude diisopropylbenzene hydroperoxide, with a solvent which results in a stable system. In most cases the diisopropylbenzene monohydroperoxide or diisopropylbenzene dihydroperoxide is 1,4 diisopropylbenzene monohydroperoxide or 1,4 diisopropylbenzene dihydroperoxide, although odiisopropylbenzene monohydroperoxide, o diisopropylbenzene dihydroperoxide, m diisopropylbenzene monohydroperoxide, m diisopropylbenzene dihydroperoxide, or mixtures thereof are also suitable for the purposes of this invention.It should be noted that, for the purposes of this invention, diisopropylbenzene monohydroperoxide is effective but diisopropylbenzene dihydroperoxide is less effective in the process of Richard U.S. Patent 3,879,339. The presence of diisopropylbenzene dihydroperoxide in admixture with diisopropylbenzene monohydroperoxide is therefore not usually desired. The term crude diisopropylbenzene hydroperoxide as used hereinafter is intended to mean a composition substantially as defined above. In the commercial manufacture of p diisopropylbenzene dihydroperoxide, an organic peroxide composition is obtained as a byproduct known in the trade as crude diisopropylbenzene hydroperoxide and consisting essentially of diisopropylbenzene dihydroperoxide diisopropylbenzene monohydroperoxide a hydroxy, a hydroperoxy diisopropyl benzene a hydroxy, diisopropyl benzene and p diisopropyl benzene. One particular crude diisopropylbenzene hydroperoxide composition which was found to be useful had approximately the following composition 55.9 diisopropylbenzene monohydroperoxide 11.0 diisopropylbenzene dihydroperoxide 10.0 0 diisopropylbenzene 0.44 benzene 1.5 water 21.0 0 Mixture of 1 isopropyl 4 isopropanol benzene, diisopropyl benzene, 1 is opropanol 4 is opropyl benzene hydroperoxide, and p benzene dipropenoic acid disodium salt.The stated percentages, as used herein, are by weight based on total composition unless otherwise stated. Solvents which are usable in preparing stable peroxide compositions in accordance with this invention are organic solvents which are cosolvents for diisopropylbenzene monohydroperoxide, diisopropylbenzene dihydroperoxide and hydrogen peroxide. Solvents which are particularly useful are methanol, cyclohexanone, glycol ethers, furfuryl alcohol, diisopropyl benzene in compositions not containing hydrogen peroxide , dioxane and phenol. Such solvents will dissolve mixtures of diisopropylbenzene monohydroperoxide and diis opropylbenzene dihydroperoxide, such as crude diisopropylbenzene hydroperoxide and are cosolvents for hydrogen peroxide. The proportions of organic peroxides and solvents in the following Examples are for purposes of illustration only. The peroxides may be mixed with any of the specified types of solvents at suitable proportions within the range of solubilities therein. Generally, the peroxides are present in an amount sufficient to provide a desired level of Active Oxygen in the composition, preferably about 6 8 .The composition may be prepared with or without the hydrogen peroxide but generally it is best to include the hydrogen peroxide. A level of about 80 of a mixture of crude diisopropylbenzene hydroperoxide and hydrogen peroxide in one of the specified solvents will produce the desired amount of Active Oxygen. If substantially pure diisopropyl benzene monohydroperoxide is used in the composition, it will produce the desired amount of Active Oxygen at a much lower concentration therein. Likewise, increasing the amount of hydrogen peroxide may permit some decrease in the amount of the organic peroxide used. The concentration of hydrogen peroxide can not be increased very much without exceeding safety limits A series of peroxide solutions or compositions were prepared and tested for stability and safety and were subsequently tested in the polymerization of resins. PREPARATION OF CATALYST AND STABILITY TESTING EXAMPLE I A peroxide composition was prepared having the following composition 68 fo crude diisopropylbenzene hydroperoxide 21 cyclohexanone 11 fo 70 hydrogen peroxide It should be noted that the amount of solvent in this composition is somewhat critical. If the proportion of cyclohexanone is decreased below about 19 some of the ingredients begin to drop out of solution. This composition was tested by the Association of American Railroads, Bureau of Explosives and was found to be satisfactory for safe transportation. A portion of the composition was maintained at 75 0C under a water reflux condensor for 48 hours. It did not ignite or undergo marked decomposition. A portion of the sample contained in a plastic cup was initiated with a K 8 electric blasting cap, it did not explode or ignite. The same results were obtained when the same test was conducted using 120ml. of the sample absorbed in eight grams of cotton. A portion of the sample was placed on a kerosenesoaked sawdust bed and ignited with a burning fuse. When the fire reached the test portion, it burned only moderately. One gallon of the sample contained in a one gallon metal can with a friction sealed lid was heated on a kerosene wood fire. The lid opened partially six minutes after the kerosene wood was ignited. The material was ignited and burned with a black smoke for about five minutes.The flame height was about 40 50 feet 13 to 17 metres . The flash point of this sample was determined to be 1740F 750C using the SETA Closed Cup Flash Point Tester. In a burning test, the sample could be ignited with a match and burned with a maximum flame height of eighteen inches. In a pressure vessel test, the rupture disc failed to burst with the vent hole opening of one mm in diameter. In an impact test, the sample failed consistently to explode or ignite in the Bureau of ExplosivesImpact Apparatus under a drop height of ten inches when the sample was tested alone or absorbed in filter paper. In a Rapid Heat Test, the sample boiled at 105 0C 175 C, left about half of the sample behind. The colour of the material turned darker as the temperature increased. The remained dark yellow material turned to a redish orange colour at 1870C, then turned to brown colour at 3100C. No further reaction was observed up to 325 0C. In a SADT Test, no exothermic reaction was observed for seven days with one gallon of the same sample contained in a plastic bottle was tested at 1300F 550C . However, the colour of the material turned brown. Based on the above test results, the Bureau ofExplosives recommendation was that the composition to be described as 1,4 diisopropylbenzene monohydroperoxide solution, not over 60 and classed as Organic Peroxide under DOT regulations. This material is considered safe and transportable. The peroxide composition of this example has anActive Oxygen content of about 7.8 8.0to. After storage at 1300F 550C for one week, Active Oxygen decreases by about 0.3 . This composition is stable for an indefinite period of time at temperatures near OOF 180C . This composition is usable in resin polymerization, as described below. EXAMPLE II A peroxide composition was prepared as follows 67.20 crude diisopropylbenzene hydroperoxide 20.60 cyclohexanone 1.96 methanol 10.24 70 hydrogen peroxide This formulation is stable under the same conditions discussed in connection with Example I. The ActiveOxygen content of this composition is about 7.8 8.0 .After storage at 1300F 55 C for one week, Active Oxygen decreases by about 0.3. This blend is stable for an indefinite period at temperaturesnear OOF 18 C . This composition can be used in the polymerization of resins as described below. EXAMPLE III A peroxide composition was prepared as follows 69 crude diisopropylbenzene hydroperoxide 10 cyclohexanone 10 0 dipropyleneglycol 11 70 hydrogen peroxide This formulation is stable under the same conditions discussed in connection with Examples I and II.The Active Oxygen content of this composition is about 7.8 8.0 . After storage at 1250F 530C for 30 days,Active Oxygen decreases by about 0.4 . This blend is stable for an indefinite period at temperatures near 0 0F 180C . This composition can be used in the polymerization of resins as described below. EXAMPLE IV A peroxide composition is prepared as follows 40 diisopropylbenzene monohydroperoxide 50 cyclohexanone 10 70 hydrogen peroxide This formulation is stable under the same conditions discussed in connection with Examples I and II.The Active Oxygen content of this composition is about 5.8 6.0. After storage at 1300F 55 C for 7 days, ActiveOxygen decreases by about 0.3. This blend is stable for an indefinite period at temperatures near 00F 180C .This composition can be used in the polymerization of resins as described below. EXAMPLE V A peroxide composition is prepared as follows 50 0 diisopropylbenzene monohydroperoxide 50 diisopropylbenzene This formulation is stable under the same conditions discussed in connection with Examples I and II.The Active Oxygen content of this composition is somewhat lower than the other compositions, but is high, enough to be effective. After storage at 1300F 550C for 7 days,Active Oxygen decreases by about 0.3 . This blend is stable for an indefinite period at temperatures near 0 0F 18 C . This composition can be used in the polymerization of resins as described below. SOLUBILITY OF PEROXIDE COMPOSITION IN RESIN It was found unexpectedly that the above peroxide compositions are soluble in and form stable mixtures with resin precursors, such as furfuryl alcohol and polyfurfuryl alcohol, and resin prepolymers such as furfuryl alcoholformaldehyde resin, phenolic and or urèa formaldehyde modified furfuryl alcohol formaldehyde resin and phenolic resin prepolymers, in the range from about 10 to 40 owt. to form storage stable compositions. EXAMPLE VI A solution of 35 crude diisopropylbenzene hydroperoxide and 65 furfurylalcohol formaldehyde resin prepolymer was prepared and stored for six weeks at 105OF 4O0C . At the end of this time, the blend showed no performance loss when polymerized to form sand cores or moulds. A solution of 25 crude diisopropylbenzene hydroperoxide and 75 furfurylalcohol formaldehyde resin prepolymer was prepared and stored for six weeks at 105OF 400C . At the end of this time, the blend showed no performance loss when polymerized to form sand cores or moulds. A solution of 20 crude diisopropylbenzene hydroperoxide and 80 furfurylalcohol formaldehyde resin prepolymer was prepared and stored for six weeks at 105OF 400C . At the end of this time, the blend showed no performance loss when polymerized to form sand cores or moulds. Similar results are obtained when diisopropylbenzene monohydroperoxide is blended with the resin prepolymer at these concentrations. In comparison, it had previously been found that methyl ethyl ketone peroxide was not stable when mixed with furfurylalcohol formaldehyde resin prepolymer even at room temperature. EXAMPLE VII A solution of 10 crude diisopropylbenzene hydroperoxide and 90 furfurylalcohol formaldehyde resin prepolymer is prepared and stored for six weeks at 105OF 400C . At the end of this time, the blend shows no performance loss when polymerized to form sand cores or moulds. A solution of 20 crude diiscpropylbenzene hydroperoxide and 80 phenol formaldehyde resin prepolymer is prepared and stored for six weeks at 1050F 4O0C . At the end of this time, the blend shows no performance loss when polymerized to form sand cores or moulds. This composition, however, is much less effective in forming sand cores or moulds than the furfurylalcohol formaldehyde resin prepolymer compositions. The initial strength and hardness of the sand cores or moulds are lower, although they are about the same after 24 hours. A solution of 20 crude diisopropylbenzene hydroperoxide and 80 furfurylalcohol formaldehyde phenolformaldehyde urea formaldehyde resin prepolymer 50 20 30 wt. ratio is prepared and stored for six weeks at 105OF 400C . At the end of this time, the blend shows no performance loss when polymerized to form sand cores or moulds. Similar results are obtained when diisopropylbenzene monohydroperoxide is blended with the resin prepolymer at these concentrations. In comparison, it had previously been found that methyl ethyl Wet one peroxide was not stable when mixed with furfurylalcohol formaldehyde resin prepolymer and other resin prepolymers even at room temperature. EXAMPLE VIII A.solution of S5 crude diisopropylbenzene hydroperoxide and 65 furfurylalcohol resin precursor is prepared and stored for six weeks at 1050F 400C . At the end of this time, the blend shows no performance loss when polymerized to form sand cores or moulds. A solution of 25 crude diisopropylbenzene hydroperoxide and 75 polyfurfurylalcohol resin precursor is prepared and stored for six weeks at 1050F 40 C . At the end of this time, the blend showed no performance loss when polymerized to form sand cores or moulds. Similar results are obtained when diisopropylbenzene monohydroperoxide is blended with the resin precursor at these concentrations. In comparison, methyl ethyl ketone peroxide is not stable when mixed with furfurylalcohol or polyfurfuryl alcohol resin precursors even at room temperature. USE OF ORGANIC PEROXIDES IN RESIN POLYMERIZATION The organic peroxide compositions described above are unexpectedly superior in stability and resistance to detonation which makes them easier to transport, store and use. These peroxide compositions are unexpectedly superior to methyl ethyl ketone peroxide which has been the standard peroxide for resin polymerization by the S02 gassing process for the polymerization of furfuryl alcoholformaldehyde resin prepolymers by the SO2 gassing process although they are not effective in the polymerization of phenolics by such a process. In the following examples the core strength and tensile strength of the core and mould products are quoted in units of pounds per square inch with the metric equi valets given in brackets in units of Newtons per square metre corresponding to Pascals. The core hardness values quoted are those obtained using a core hardness tester manufactured by the H.W. Dietert Company and are based on the force required to cause the teeth of the tester to penetrate the core.
