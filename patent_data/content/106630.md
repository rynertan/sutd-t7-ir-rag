# Drive mechanisms for inked ribbon cassettes.

## Abstract
In a stuffed inked ribbon cassette in which ribbon in convoluted form in a stuffing chamber is withdrawn under tension from an outlet and returns along an inlet after passage past a printer, it has been found that a drive wheel 15 having a ratchet tooth form gives surprisingly effective traction on the ribbon. The drive wheel may be used with an idler wheel 35 having a ratchet tooth form or in another embodiment there may also be a simple opposed spring 16 , the ribbon passing between the drive wheel 34 and the idler wheel 35 .
