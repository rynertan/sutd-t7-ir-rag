## Description
The present invention relates to a filter for separating luminance signals and chrominance signals hereinafter referred to as the YC separating filter whereby the luminance signals hereinafter referred to as the Y signals and the chrominance signals hereinafter referred to as the C signals are separated and extracted from composite television signals composite video signals of a PAL system phase alternative by line color system . More particularly, the present invention relates to a system under which the analog composite television signals of PAL system are converted into digital signals, which are subsequently separated into Y and C signals. Under the current standard color television system the Y and C signals are transmitted as frequency multiplexed composite signals. Accordingly it is required for the receivers to separate the Y and C signals distinctly from the composite signals received thereat. The composite television signals P of PAL system consists of the Y signal, and the C signal which is produced by executing a quadrature two phase modulation to two color difference signals U and V alternatively, I and Q by a color sub carrier frequency fsc. The P is expressed as follows where the means the for the odd scanning lines and the for the even scanning lines. This means that the V components are reversed in every scanning line. Suppose that the frame frequency be fF 25Hz , the field frequency fV 50Hz , the horizontal scanning frequency be fH 15.625KHz , the following relationship is established between these and the above mentioned fsc It will be understood from this relationship that the fsc and fH are in the 1 4 line off set relationships. For this reason a sample signal series obtained from the composite television signals of PAL system being synchronuously sampled with a sampling frequency fs of four times the color sub carrier frequency is represented in a two dimensional array on the screen as shown in Figure 1. It will be understood from Figure 1 that the phases of the color signals are repeated at each of four lines. In Figure 1 the rectangles, circles and triangles show sampling points Ps, and the Y shows luminance signals, and the C1, C2, C1 , and C2 show color signals, the U1, U2, V1 and V2 show color difference signals, respectively. In order to secure the compatibility with monochrome television signals, it is required that the receivers can separate Y and C signals exactly from the composite color television signals containing C signals which are frequency multiplexed in such a manner that the spectrum frequency interleaves in the frequency band of the Y signals. Figure 2 shows an example of the known Y C separating filter The reduction circuit 9 reduces the output of the horizontal band pass filter 8 from that of the 1st delay circuit 41, which means that the circuit 9 reduces the chrominance signal C from the composite television signal P . Thus the Y signal is obtained in the output of the reduction circit 9. The output terminals 10 and 11 are connected to the horizontal band pass filter 8, and the reduction circuit 9, respectively, from which it will be understood that the C signal is obtained at the terminal 10, and that the Y signal is obtained at the terminal 11. As evident from the foregoing description, the conventional filter for separating the Y and C signals comprises a combination of a horizontal and vertical filters fixed together. In addition, the conventional system is on the presumption that the picture elements as the sample value series of television signals which are adjacent to each other on the screen are similar with each other. Consequently, in an area where the luminance and chrominance of picture rapidly change, the Y signal and C signal are likely to leak into each channel, thereby causing cross color and cross luminance distortion. This spoils the quality of the reproduction of pictures. Prior art document United States patent 4,141,035, Maxemchuk et al, discloses a technique for separating composite video signals. Chrominance and luminance component estimates for the vertical and horizontal directions are compared with previously chrominance and luminance components to establish which of the pairs of estimates is the closest. As such if there is any error in the separation there may be a tendency for errors to propagate. The present invention addresses the problem of providing a more accurate separation of luminance and chrominance signals. The means by which this is achieved has the incidental advantage that such error propagation is avoided. The present invention is directed to overcome the problems pointed out above, and provides a YC separating filter of PAL system wherein the input composite color television signals are converted into digital signals by sampling signals having a frequency of four times the color sub carrier frequency, and the luminance signals and chrominance signals are separated from each other, which secures an exact separation with the use of a one line memory and without the use of a two line memory. According to the present invention, there is provided a filter for separating luminance and chrominance signals from the composite television signals of PAL system, as set out in claim 1, and a method for separating the luminance and chrominance components of a composite television video signal as set out in claim 10.

Then the 3rd delay circuit 21a outputs a signal at P6 the 5th sample signal the 4th delay circuit 21b outputs a signal at P1 the 1st sample signal the 1st delay circuit 43 outputs a signal at P5 the 4th sample signal the 2nd delay circuit 44 outputs a signal at P2 the 2nd sample signal the 5th delay circuit 21c outputs a signal at P4 the signal to be separated and the 6th delay circuit 21d outputs a signal at P3 the 3rd smaple signal . In this case, the point where the Y and C separation is to be carried out, that is, the signal to be separated is the P4. Referring to Figure 5, the switching signal generator 26 sends a control signal to the 2nd switching circuit 24a, in such a manner as to allow the output signal from the 3rd delay circuit 21a to pass, and sends a control signal to the 1st switching circuit 24b to allow the output signal from the 2nd delay circuit 44 to pass. In this way the output signal of the 2nd switching circuit 24a becomes a sample value of the point P6, and likewise that of the 1st switching circuit 24b becomes a sample value of the point P2. The 1st addition circuit 22a adds the output of the 2nd switching circuit 24a and that of the 1st switching circuit 24b, and the 1st multiplication circuit 63 multiplies the output of the addition circuit 22a 1 4 times. The 3rd multiplication circuit 51 multiplies the output of the 5th delay circuit 21c 1 2 times. The 3rd reduction circuit 93 reduces the output of the 1st multiplication circuit 63 from that of the 3rd multiplication circuit 51, and outputs a signal Hc which is expressed by The 2nd addition circuit 22b adds the output of the 1st delay circuit 43 and that of the 6th delay circuit 21d, and the 2nd multiplication circuit 64 multiplies the output of the addition circuit 22b 1 4 times. The 5th reduction circuit 95 reduces the output of the 2nd multiplication circuit 64 from the output of the 3rd multiplication circuit 51. In this way the output signal of the circuit 95, that is, Vc signal is expressed by The outputs of the 2nd switching circuit 24a and the 1st switching circit 24b are applied to the 2nd reduction circuit 92, the output of which is taken an absolute value by the 1st absolute value circuit 23a. Accordingly, the output signal Tv of the 1st absolute value circuit 23a is Under the illustrated system the adjacent picture element signals whose phases of color sub carrier waves are reversed relative to that of the signal to be separated the reversed sampling points are used to detect a direction in which the signals have less variation, and the picture element signal in the detected direction is used to separate the C signals from the composite television signals. This system ensures an exact, clear separation. At next, the case in Figure 6 is described in the following with the use of the circuit of Figure 3. Suppose that the A D converter 2 outputs a signal at P7 the 6th sample signal at a time T. The 3rd delay circuit 21a outputs a signal at P6 the 5th sample signal the 4th delay circuit 21b outputs a signal at P1 the 1st sample signal the 1st delay circuit 43 outputs a signal at P5 the 4th sample signal the 2nd delay circuit 44 outputs a signal at P2 the 2nd sample signal the 5th delay circuit 21c outputs a signal at P4 the signal to be separated and the 6th delay circuit 21d outputs a signal at P3 the 3rd sample signal . In the embodiment shown in Figure 6 the switching signal generator 26 sends a control signal to the 2nd switching circuit 24a in such a manner as to allow the output signal of the A D converter 2 to pass, and sends a control signal to the 1st switching circuit 24b in such a manner as to allow the output signal of the 4th delay circuit 21b to pass. In this way the output of the 2nd switching circuit 24a becomes a sample value at the point P7, and that of the 1st switching circuit 24 becomes a sample value at the point P1. The 1st addition circuit 22a adds the outputs of the 2nd switching circuit 24a and of the 1st switching circuit 24b, and the 1st multiplication circuit 63 multiplies the output of the circuit 22a 1 4 times. The 3rd multiplication circuit 51 multiplies the output of the 5th delay circuit 21c 1 2 times. The 3rd reduction circuit 93 reduces the output of the 1st multiplication circuit 63 from that of the 3rd multiplication circuit 51. In this way the output signal of this reduction circuit 93 Hc is expressed by Under the illustrated system the adjacent picture element signals whose color sub carrier wave phases are reversed relative to that of the signal to be separated are used to detect a direction in which the signals have less variation, and the picture elements in the detected direction are used to separate the C signals from the composite television signals. Thus the system ensures an exact, clear separation. The operation of the switching signal generator 26 will be described The cases 1 and 2 have been described with reference to Figures 5 and 6, respectively. To embody a Y and C signals separating filter, it is required to ascertain which case of the Figures 5 and 6 the arrangement of the adjacent sampling points belong to, and send a control signal to the 2nd or 1st switching circuit 24a or 24b, respectively. For example, in Figures 5 and 6 the absolute value of the difference signal between the sample value at the point P4 the signal to be separated and that at the point P1, and the absolute value of the difference between the sample value at the point P4 and that at the point P2 are compared. When the relationship is opposite, the switching signal generator 26 outputs a control signal in such a manner as to allow the 2nd switching circuit 24a to pass the output signal of the A D converter 2, and to allow the 1st switching circuit 24b to pass the output signal of the 4th delay circuit 21b. For example, when the phase of the sampling signal is fixed, the two dimensional arrangement shown in Figure 4 is fixed. Accordingly, the generator 26 can be constructed so that the 2nd and 1st switching circuits 24a, 24b are switched at every sampling point on each line through the recognition of horizontal lines of the input signals at the terminal 1. The 1st reduction circuit 91 reduces the output of the switching circuit 24c from that of the 5th delay circuit 21c, the latter output being a composite television signal, and the output signal of the selecting cirucit 24c being a C signal separated from the composite television signal. As a result, the output of the 1st reduction circuit 91 becomes a Y signal. Under the above mentioned system the sample values at points one line up and below or alternatively the smaple values at points two points forward and backward on the same line with relative to a specific sampling point are used to effect the separation of Y and C signals. Since the used sample values have little variation, the exact and clear separation is secured as compared with the conventional separating system. In addition, the values of the adjacent sampling points are used to detect a direction in which the signals have less variation, and the output of the filter in the detected direction is used to separate the Y signal. As a result, the exact, clear separaation is secured even when the video images are subjected to violent changes. This leads to the production of images free from cross color or cross luminance distortion. Furthermore, the A D conversion is performed with the sampling pulses having a frequency of four times that of color sub carrier waves, and a phase in accordance with the axis of the color difference signal, thereby ensuring that reversed sampling points whose color sub carrier wave phases are reversed to that of a specific sampling point are obtained one line up and below. This means that under this system no two line memory is required but a single line memory will suffice, thereby decreasing the production cost. Referring to Figure 7, a modified version of the embodiment will be described The circuit shown in Figure 7 is operated as follows Referring to Figures 9 and 10, the embodiment shown in Figure 7 will be described in greater detail, wherein the picture in Figure 9 has the addition of reference numerals and characters to that in Figure 8. The situatin in Figure 9 will be described by using the circuit in Figure 7 In the case of Figure 9 the switching signal generating circuit 26 outputs a control signal of the 1st state signal to the 2nd switching circuit 24a in such a manner as to allow the output signal of the 1st 1 2 times circuit 51 to pass, and also outputs a control signal of the 1st state signal to the 1st switching circuit 24b in such a manner as to allow the output signal of the 5th delay circuit 21c to pass. The 1st addition circuit 22a adds the output of the A D converter 2 and that of the 4th delay circuit 21b, and the 4th multiplication circuit 51 multiplies the output of the 1st addition circuit 22a 1 2 times. As a result, the output of the 1st addition circuit 22a, that is, the output of the 2nd switching circuit 24a is expressed by The 3rd addition circuit 22c adds the output of the 2nd switching circuit 24a and that of the 1st switching circuit 24b, and the 1st multiplication circuit 63 multiplies the output of the addition circuit 22c 1 4 times. The 3rd multiplication circuit 53 multiplies the output of the 7th delay circuit 21e 1 2 times. The 3rd reduction circuit 93 reduces the output of the 1st multiplication circuit 63 from the output of the 3rd multiplication circuit 53. Consequently, the output signal Hc of the 1st reduction circuit 93 is expressed by Under the illustrated system the adjacent picture element signals whose color sub carrier wave phases are reversed with relative to the particular picture element are used to detect a direction in which the signals have little variation, and the picture elements in the detected direction are used to separate the C signals from the composite television signals. Thus the system ensures the exact, clear separation. The example of Figure 10 will be described with reference to Figure 7 In the case of Figure 10 the switching signal generating circuit 26 outputs a control signal to the 2nd switching circuit 24a so as to allow the output signal of the 3rd delay circuit 21a to pass, and outputs a control signal to the 1st switching circuit 24b so as to allow the output signal of the 5th multiplication circuit 52 to pass. The 2nd addition circuit 22b adds the output of the 2nd delay circuit 44 and that of the 6th delay circuit 21d, and the 5th multiplication circuit 52 multiplies the output of the 2nd addition circuit 22b 1 2 times. Therefore, the output of the 2nd addition circuit 22b, that is, the output signal of the 1st switching circuit 24b is expressed by The 3rd addition circuit 22c adds the output of the 2nd switching circuit 24a and the 1st switching circuit 24b, and the 1st multiplication circuit 63 multiplies the output of the addition circuit 22c 1 4 times. The 3rd multiplication circuit 53 multiplies the output of the 7th delay circuit 21e 1 2 times. The 3rd reduction circuit 93 reduces the output of the 1st multiplication circuit 63 from the output of the 3rd multiplication cirucit 53. Thus the output signal Hc of the reduction circuit 93 is expressed by Under the illustrated system the adjacent picture element signals whose color sub carrier wave phases are reversed with relative to that of the particular picture element are used to detect a direction in which the signals have less variation, and the picture elements in the detected direction are used to separate the C signals from the composite television signals. Thus the system ensures an exact, clear separation of C and Y signals. The operation of the switching signal generating circuit 26 will be described In the opposite case Figure 10 the switching signal generating circuit 26 outputs a control signal so as to allow the 2nd switching circuit 24a to pass the output signal of the 3rd delay circuit 21a, and to allow the 1st switching circuit 24b to pass the output signal of the 5th multiplication circuit 52. When the phase of the sampling signal is fixed, the patterns shown in Figure 8 are equally fixed. Therefore, it is possible to construct the switching signal generating circuit 26 so that the 2nd and 1st switching circuits 24a, 24b can be switched at each sampling point on one line through the recognition of the horizontal line of the input signal. The 1st reduction circuit luminance signal output circuit 91 reduces the output of the selecting circuit 24c from that of the 7th delay circuit 21e. The output signal of the 7th delay circuit 21e is a composite television signal, and the output signal of the selecting circuit 24c is a C signal which has been separated from the composite television signal. As a result, the output signal of the 1st multiplication circuit 91 becomes a Y signal. As evident from the foregoing description, the sampling points one line up and below or the sampling points two points forward and backward on the same line are used to perform the separation of Y and C signals. An advantage of this system is that each sampling point has little variation, which results in the exact separation of Y and C signals. Furthermore, the adjacent samling points are used to detect a direction in which the signals have less variation, and the output of the filter in the detected direction is used to separate the Y signals. This method ensures the exact and clear separtion regardless of the situation in which video images are subjected to violent changes, and that the images free from cross color or cross luminance distortion is reproduced. In the embodiment illustrated in Figure 7, the A D conversion is performed with the use of a sampling pulse having a frequency of four times that of the color sub carrier wave, and whose phase is 45 advanced or delayed with relative to the color difference signal. This makes it possible to obtain a reversed sampling point whose color sub carrier wave phase is reversed with relative to that of the desired sampling point one line up and below thereof, thereby eliminating the necessity of using a two line memory. The use of a single line memory leads to the decreased production cost.
