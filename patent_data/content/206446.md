# Producing fused polymeric articles.

## Abstract
Novel particulate polymeric materials which can be ar ranged in a predetermined three dimensional pattern in or on a support surface, fused and cooled to provide fused, three dimensional polymeric articles. The particulate poly meric materials have the capability to provide a release coating about the fused polymeric article which permits re moval of the article from the support surface carrying the article.
