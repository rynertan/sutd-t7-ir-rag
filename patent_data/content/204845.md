A method of controlling a rotary cutter which is adapted to cut an elongated material 15 , such as a steel plate and corrugated cardboard, which is transferred between a pair of rotating shears 13 having a shear blade on their respective circumferential surfaces, to a set length while controlling a shear driving motor 9 . In this control method, an optimum shearing position of minimum energy is determined on the basis of a quantity of movement â„“
