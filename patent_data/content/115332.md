# Chromogenic tracers for use in an assay.

## Abstract
A chromogen, in particular, a fluorescent compound, is conjugated to a ligand through an amino acid spacer radial, which includes a free carboxyl group. The tracers are particularly suitable for use in a flow through assay for low molecular weight analytes. The tracers are rapidly bound, of good sensitivity, and low non specific binding.
