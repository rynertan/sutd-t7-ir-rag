# Continuous ink jet printing.

## Abstract
In a continuous ink jet printing method for printing multiple lines of print 13 15 , raster of drops is produced in which the differential charge between drops printed on opposite sides of an interline gap 17, 18 is increased in comparison with that between adjacent drops to be printed within a line 13 15 . At the same time the number of guard drops is maintained the same or is reduced between the printable drops immediately adjacent to the interline gap, so that the distance between printed drops immediately adjacent to the interline gap is increased without increasing the number of drops in the raster.
