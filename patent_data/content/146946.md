## Description
IRON ELECTRODE AND A PROCESS FOR ITS MANUFACTUREThe present invention concerns an improved iron electrode for use in electrochemical accumulators. It concerns, in particular, an electrode for use in association with a positive electrode, for example, a nickel electrode, in an accumulator wherein the electrolyte is an alkaline solution.The principle of negative iron electrodes is per se known and resides in the oxidation reaction of iron metal so as to form an iron hydroxide and generate electrons.In order to improve the performance of such electrodes, it has long been attempted to promote contact between those substances which must react with one another, as well as to promote the transfer and collection of electrons,It has also been proposed to construct electrodes from conducting microporous substrates, the pores of which contain the active substance. Such electrodes can take the form of a thin layer deposited throughout the entire thickness of the substrate, fully along its surface, as described in European patent application No. 80401007.2.However, none of these proposed embodiments have yet provided an iron electrode which offers sufficient performance to develop an accumulator having satisfactory characteristics, particularly with regard to the energy mass ratio, the power and the energy yield of the accumulator.The present invention therefore has as its object to produce a novel iron electrode which offers good performance, and in which the electron transfer phenomena is significantly enhanced.To this end, the present invention concerns an electrode having an active material disposed in the pores of a conducting porous substrate, which is in turn subjected to sintering. In accordance with the present invention, the active substance is a fine iron powder, the particles of which are either totally or partially coated with a permeable and porous copper deposit. The active substance is introduced by kneading into an open pored, tridimensional, conductive metallic structure. Such a conductive structure can advantageously be a branched structure such as is disclosed in European patent application No. 80401007.2 published under NO 0022 409 .The resulting iron electrode exhibits the characteristic of having two electron conducting grids. The first conducting grid is a macroscopic grid constituted by the porous substrate. The second conducting grid is a microscopic grid constituted by the copper which coats the iron particles. This second conducting grid provides improved yields for the active substance, and reduced polarization at high discharge rates.Further in accordance with the present invention, the iron electrode is cadmiated, i.e. partially covered with cadmium.The grain size of the iron powder is between 1 and 10 microns, and preferably equals about 4 microns. The ratio between the deposited copper mass and the iron mass is between 5 and 15 , and preferably equals about 10 . The ratio between the cadmium mass and the iron mass is between 2 and 8 , and is preferably about 5 .The present invention also concerns a process for making such an iron electrode, which generally comprises kneading an iron powder on o a conducting porous substrate, followed by a sintering step. In accordance with the present invention, at least portions of the iron particles are coated with copper, which coating is microporous and permeable, prior to the kneading operation. Such coating of the particles is accomplished by placing the iron powder in suspension in an acid solution, the pH of which is between 4 and 5, and by then adding copper sulfate to the solution. Preferably, the acid solution used is a boric acid solution or a dilute sulfuric acid solution.The principal advantage of this coating process resides in its development of a microporous copper layer which serves as an ion permeable microscopic grid.Further in accordance with the present invention, a paste is formed using the coated powder, a binder such as methyl cellulose, and a liquid such as water or alcohol. The resulting mixture is introduced into the porous substrate, dried, compacted and sintered. Generally, the compacting occurs at a pressure between 100 and 1000 bar. However, in a particularly preferred embodiment, this compacting occurs at a pressure under 200 bar to extend the lifespan of the electrode. The resulting iron electrode is then preferably subjected to another stage of the process according to the present invention, which includes a heat treatment under a neutral or reducing atmosphere at a temperature between 650 and 9500C.Further in accordance with the present invention, before the kneading step, the coated powder is advantageously mixed with a spacing agent, which is removed after sintering by an elimination treatment. The spacing agent is preferably silica or alumina, and the elimination treatment is preferably a chemical process accomplished in a basic bath.In a preferred embodiment of an electrode produced in accordance with the present invention, alumina is used as the spacing agent and the elimination treatment takes place in a soda bath. In connection with the use of a spacing agent, the compacting operation is preferably performed under a pressure of 250 bar. Preferably, the alumina used is anhydrous.The use of such an iron electrode is advantageous in increasing the porosity of the active substance from 25 to 55 . Thus, the electrolyte which is generally potash can move freely in the electrode during its use. A volumetric increase resulting from the iron to iron hydroxide transformation is allowed to take place in the mass and neither disturbs the surface of the electrode nor completely closes the pores. Thus, the use of the active material by the mass increases from 500 Ah kg without a spacing agent up to 650 Ah kg.Further in accordance with the present invention, the resulting electrode is advantageously subjected to a cadmiating operation by precipitation of a cadmium salt, followed by electrochemical reduction. This operation serves to reduce the autodischarge of the electrode by increasing the Faraday yields of charge, by increasing the hydrogen overpotential.The present invention and its advantages will be better understood by a reading of the following description, given as a non limiting illustration, with reference to the appended drawings in which Figure 1 is a partial view of an electrode according to the present invention, Figure 2 is a sectional view of the conducting substrate, Figures J, 4 and 5 are discharge graphs representing the developed voltage as a function of time for an accumulator incorporating an electrode according to the present invention, and Figure 6 is a graph representing the electrode s capacity as a function of the number of operating cycles, for different spacing agents.Figure 1 represents a portion of an iron electrode produced in accordance with the present invention. The electrode shown generally incorporates a branched structure of copper as is more specifically represented inFigure 2, and which comprises fibers 1, 2, 3 which combine to develop a honeycomb grid 4. The fibers 1, 2, 3 of the grid 4 combine to define a series of pores 7. The average dimension of the resulting mesh 5 is about 0.75 mm. The thickness of the fibers 1, 2, 3 is about 30 microns. Within the pores 7, the active material is present in the form of fine particles 8 of iron, having a grain size of about 4 microns. Each iron particle is surrounded by a thin layer of copper 9. The resulting particles are placed in partial contact with one another by the successive effects of kneading, compacting and sintering, as will be more fully described below, and are preferably at least partly coated with cadmium.The manufacture of such an electrode proceeds in the following manner.The conductor structure or branched structure is produced according to one of the processes disclosed inEuropean patent application No. 80401007.2, the subject matter of wich is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. The surface density of this structure is equal to about 50 mg cm2. Furthermore, the active substance iron powder is prepared from an iron powder obtained by the reduction of carbonyl iron, such that the powder exhibits a low grain size and a large specific surface. The particles of the powder are then subjected to a coating and agglomeration stage, with the copper. To this end, the powder is put into suspension in an acid solution e.g, boric acid , the pH of which is adjusted to between 4 and 5. The necessary quantity of copper sulfate is then added by progressively supplying a copper sulfate solution of 100 g l until there is obtained a deposited weight of copper of about 5 to 15 by weight with respect to the iron. This step serves to develop a microporous and discontinous copper film which is ion permeable.The coated powder is then dried, and a paste is made of this powder, ethyl alcohol and methyl cellulose. The paste is then introduced by kneading into the conductor structure, dried, and compacted under a presure of about 200 bar. Such compacting can also be carried out at other pressures between 100 and 1000 bar, in appropriate cases.The iron electrode thus obtained is thereafter subjected to a heat treatment sintering in a neutral or reducing atmosphere at a temperature between 650 and 9500C, and preferably at about 8000C. The methyl cellulose contained in the paste, which serves as a binder during the first step in manufacturing the electrode, is eliminated during this heat treatment.After sintering, the electrode is first dipped into a cadmium salt solution, the concentration of which is appropriate to cause about 5 by weight of cadmium to become fixed in the pores of the electrode, then dried and thereafter immersed in a potassium hydroxide solution to precipitate the cadmium in the form of a hydroxide. The cadmium is then electrochemically reduced. The weight of the cadmium added is preferably about 6 mg cm2, or about 5 by weight of the active substance. The addition of cadmium, by increasing the hydrogen overpotential, serves to increase the yields of charge to values close to 80 at state C 2 total discharge in 2 hours or at state C 5 total discharge in 5 hours .The electrode thus obtained exhibits good performance, developing a mass capacity of about 350 Ah kg. The performance of this electrode has been analysed in the following manner.An electrode of 50 cm2 was placed between two nickel electrodes of the type disclosed in European patent application No. 80401007.2. The resulting accumulator has the following properties surface density of the copper support ... 50 mg cm2 weight of the active substance ........ 100 mg cm2 capacity at state C 5 O .. 2.3 ampere hour Ah at 250CGraphs of the output voltage developed during discharge of the resulting accumulator at 250C are shown in the drawings for three discharge rates including 0.5 A aboutC 5 in Figure 3, 1 A about 0.4 C in Figure 4, and 2 A about C in Figure 5. These graphs show the display of a quasi constant voltage of about 1.3 V during 80 of the discharge, for each of the three discharge states illustrated.The mass energy of such an accumulator varies from 75 Wh kg at 250C to 45 Wh kg at 250C, passing 60 Wh kg at OOC, each of these measurements being made for a discharge rate of C 5. For high power and short duration requirements, these tests have shown that the currents developed can reach, for a 50 cm2 electrode surface, 20 Amperes at 250C, 10 Amperes at O C and 7.5 Amperes at 250C.In manufacturing such electrodes, it is particularly preferable to dry the coated powder obtained from the coating process, and to make a paste using this powder, ethyl alcohol, methyl cellulose and anhydrous or hydrated alumina, the weight of which is about 40 by weight of the iron powder. The mixture is introduced into the branched structure by kneading, and is then compacted under a pressure of about 250 bar. The iron electrode is thereafter subjected to a heat treatment of sintering, under a neutral or reducing atmosphere and at about 850XC. The resulting structure is then subjected to an elimination step in order to eliminate the spacing agent.To this end, the electrode is immersed in a soda bath, the concentration of which is about 800 gJl t at 1300C, for about 2.5 hrs. To be noted is that the thickness of the paste layer is completely controllable during the kneading operation, since the apparent paste volume is greater than without a spacing agent. Thus, a very homogeneous compacting and a perfect regularity of the thickness of the electrode is obtained. This electrode has also been used in association with two nickel electrodes, with the resulting assembly then dipped in a 6N potash electrolyte, in order to make an accumulator. For the first discharge, a capacity of 40 mAh cm2 was obtained. The capacity tends to become optimal and steady from the 8 th cycle and thereafter. The same experiment was done with an electrode comprising 10 of alumina by weight. A capacity of 20 mAh cm7 was obtained for the first cycle. With 60 of alumina by weight, a capacity of 65 mAli cm2 was obtained from the first cycle. With 30 of alumina by weight, a capacity of 30 mAh cm2 was obtained from the first cycle, and 60 mAh cm2 from the 10 th cycle and thereafter. Figure 6 illustrates these results in representing the developed capacity of the electrode as a function of cycles and for different alumina contents, with curve 1 60 curve 2 40 curve 3 30 curve 4 10 It is to be noted that for the three curves 1, 2, 3 a stationary capacity of about 60 mAh cm2 is very quickly obtained. To manufacture an electrode according to the present invention, an alumina content of more than 30 is preferably chosen. However, for reasons of mechanical behavior, particularly due to porosity, an alumina content of less than 40 is generally chosen. The present invention is not limited . to the embodiments described herein above, but rather includes all variants thereof.
