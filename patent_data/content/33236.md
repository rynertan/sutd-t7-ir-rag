# APPARATUS FOR PERPENDICULAR MAGNETIC RECORDING ON A MOVING MAGNETIC MEDIUM

## Abstract
Apparatus for perpendicular magnetic recording on a moving magnetic medium 14 is designed to provide a low reluctance return path for the magnetic recording flux. The recording head comprises a core 10 of magnetic material carrying a coil W1 , the core having a narrow record ing limb 11 , and a flux return limb 12 having a much greater cross sectional area. A return path for the magnetic flux is provided on the other side of the magnetic medium 14 and this may comprise either a similar head 10 or a high per meability substrate on which the medium is deposited. The magnetic medium 14 moves in such a direction that it passes first under the flux return limb 12 and then under the record ing limb 11 . For reading the recorded information a sub core 16 car rying a winding W3 is attached to the flux return limb 12 and is separated by a gap from the tip of the recording limb 15 so as to form with the core a ring type reading head. This is rendered inoperative during recording by supplying to the winding W3 a sufficient current to saturate the sub core. An alternative method of reading employs magneto resistive elements within the space between the recording limb 11 and the flux return limb 12 arranged to sense flux variations from the recording medium 14 .
