# Vaccines for gram negative bacteria and method for the preparation thereof.

## Abstract
An immunizing composition is disclosed and comprises a detoxified polysaccharide from a gram negative bacterium covalently coupled to a detoxified protein from said gram negative bacterium by means of a 4 12 carbon moiety. To prepare the above immunizing agent. the lipid A portion of lipopolysaccharide from a gram negative bacterium is sepa rated to give a detoxified polysaccharide. Reactive aldehyde groups are generated on the detoxified polysaccharide by selective oxidation. The detoxified polysaccharide is then covalently coupled to a detoxified protein from said gram negative bacterium by means of a 4 12 carbon moiety having functionalities reactive to the aldehyde groups on the detoxified polysaccharide and to the carboxylic groups on the detoxified protein.
