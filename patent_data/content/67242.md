## Description
GOODS DISCHARGE MECHANISM AND GOODS STORAGE AND DISCHARGE SYSTEM OF AN AUTOMATIC VENDING MACHINEThe invention relates to a goods discharging mechanism according to the first portion of claim 1 and to a goods storage and discharge system of an automatic vending machine having a plurality of storage shelves for goods arranged in parallel rows, according to the first portion of claim 2.Figure 1 shows the general arrangement of a typical automatic vending machine having goods storage shelves of the serpentine type.Referring to Fig.1, the body 1 of an automatic vending machine has three parallel storage shelves 3 disposed in the front to rear direction, each of which has a winding goods passage 2. A plurality of cylindrical goods is stored in the rolling position in each of said goods pas sages 2. Reference numeral 6 denotes a goods discharge mechanism disposed at the lower end of the respective goods discharge passages. 5 is an outlet provided within a front panel, through which the goods are discharged.The combination of the goods storage shelves and the goods discharge mechanisms will be referred to below as the goods storage and discharge system to which the present invention pertains.The goods discharge mechanism,as a constituent part of the goods storage and discharge system generally includes a solenoid, a transmission mechanism and first and second retainer members which are adapted to be alternately extended into and retracted from the associated goods passage.The first and second retainer members are adapted to retain the lowermost article and the article second from bottom, respectively, when they are extended.On the other hand there is an increasing demand for automatic vending machines capable of accommodating a large number of goods. To this end, recently it has been found advisable to add another row of storage shelving,i.e. to mount four shelves in one vending machine. There is also a requirement for reduced dimensions of automatic vending machines, due to the restrictions on installation space.To this end, an effective measure is to reduce the width of the goods discharging mechanism disposed in the adjacent rows of the goods storage shelves to diminish the space required for the assembly of the storage shelves.Out of the component parts of the goods discharge mechanism installed between adjacent rows of storage shelves, the solenoid occupies a comparatively large space. But there is a practical limit to the reduction of the size of this solenoid. Therefore usually the thickness of the goods discharge mechanism is determined by the height of the solenoid, which imposes a limit on the reduction of the installation space occupied by the goods storage shelves and hence, on the size of the automatic vending machine as a whole.The invention as claimed is intended to remedy these drawbacks. It solves the problem of how to provide a goods discharge mechanism and a goods storage and discharge system which do not necessitate substantial installation space even if the solenoid s dimensions are rather large. According to the invention, the solenoid and the transmission system of each of the goods discharging mechanisms are disposed at one side, while two goods discharging mechanisms are arranged in the space between two adjacent storage shelves. It is therefore possible to save the space for installation of the storage shelves, which in turn contributes to a reduction in the size of the automatic vending machine as a whole.The invention is described in detail below with reference to drawings which only illustrate specific embodiments in which Fig.1 is a schematic sectional view of a conventional goods storage and discharge system Figs. 2A and 2B are side elevation views of goods discharge mechanism in accordance with the present invention Fig. 3 is a rear elevation view of the mechanism in Fig.2A Fig. 4 shows the state in which the discharge mechanismsiin Fig.2 are superimposed Fig. 5A is a schematic sectional view of a goods storage and discharge system of the invention Fig. 5B shows the arrangement of the goods storage and discharge mechaniSm of the invention by comparison with the conventional arrangement Figs. 6A and 6B are side elevation views of another goods discharge mechanism in accordance with the present invention andFig 7 is a rear elevation view of the goods discharge mechanism shown in Fig. 6A.Hereinafter first a preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to Figs. 2 to 5, in which the same reference numerals are used to denote the identical parts or members as those in Fig. 1.Firstly, the constructional design of each of the goods discharge mechanisms will be explained with specific reference to Figs. 2 and 3 which show the goods discharge mechanism in the stand by state. In these two figures, the goods discharge mechanism 6 is illustrated as including a solenoid 7, a transmission member 8, a first retainer member 9 and a second retainer member 10. These constituent parts are supported by a base plate4 which also serves as the goods transfer surface 4a see Fig. 2 of the goods passage. The solenoid 7 and the transmission mechanism 8 are disposed on the left side of the central axis A of base plate 4.A retainer assembly 11 comprising the retainer members 9 and 10 is disposed so as to extend over the entire width of base plate 4 across the centre axis A. The reference number 7a designates the movable core of said solenoid 7. The transmission mechanism 8 includes a 3 shaped connecting plate 13 which is connected at one end to the movable core 7a by a pin 12, while a push up piece 15 is connected to the other end of said connecting plate 13 by pin 14. The push up piece 15 is bent into a shape with its cent ral portion supported by a stationary hub 16 fixed to the base plate 4 so as to rotate around the axis of hub 16.The push up piece 15 carries at its end opposite to pin 14 an engaging pin 17 to engage with the second retainer member 10.Reference numeral 18 denotes a tension spring which is retained at one end by the pin 14 and by the base plate 4 at the other end, thereby biassing,via the medium of connecting plate 13, the movable core 7a in the direction opposite to the direction of attraction of solenoid 7. The first retainer member 9 is supported at one end by a stationary hub 19 fixed to the base plate 4 so as to rotate around the axis of hub 19 in order to move to and away from the goods transfer surface 4a of the base plate 4. The first retainer member 9 has an engaging piece 20 which is formed integrally therewith and is adapted for engagement with engaging pin 14 of said push up piece 15.The engaging piece 20 is provided with two engaging surfaces 20a, 20b adapted for engagement with pin 14. In the standby state shown in Fig.2, the engaging surface 20a engages with pin 14 so as to support the first retainer member 9, while the latter is projected above the goods transfer surface 4a. A line B illustrates the locus of motion of the pin 14. The engaging surface 20b is disposed at an inclined angle to the line B when it is engaged by the said pin 14. The second retainer member 10 is supported at one end by a stationary hub 21 fixed to the base plate 4 so as to rotate around the axis of hub 21 to move to and away from the goods transfer surface 4a.Said second retainer member 10 is provided with Åa projection 22 for engagement with the engaging pin 17 of the push up piece 15.Reference numerals 4b,4c denote openings formed in the base plate 4 to permit the first and second retainer members 9, 10 to be projected into the space above the goods transfer surface 4a. The lowest goods and the articles second from bottom are designated by reference numerals 23 and 23a, respectively.In operation, when the selling command is issued with the mechanism in the state shown in Fig. 2A, solenoid 7 is energized to attract the movable core 7a, overcoming the force of the tension spring 18. As the movable core 7a is attracted, connecting plate 13 is moved accordingly to cause the rotation of push up piece 15. As a result of this rotation, engaging pin 17 of the push up piece 15 raises the second retainer member 10 to project it into the space above the goods transfer passage 4a into engagement with the article 23a second from bottom.In this state the pin 14 of connecting plate 13 slides on the engaging surface 20a of the engaging piece 20 of the first retainer member 9 to leave the engaging surface 20a.Consequently the first retainer member9 loses its support, so that it is rotated or swung when pushed by the article and disappears from goods transfer surface 4a. Meanwhile, the lowest article 23 is discharged in the direction of the arrow C Fig. 2B .In this state, first retainer member 9 is prevented from rotating because the engaging surface 20b is designed to be engaged by pin 14 of connecting plate 13.After completion of the discharge of the lowest article 23, solenoid 7 is de energized to permit movable core 7a to be retracted by the force of tension spring 18 back to the position shown in Fig. 2A. Consequently the first retainer member 9 is moved to the position above the goods transfer passage 4a by the thrust from pin 14 of connecting plate 13, while the second retainer member 10 is reset to the position beneath the goods transfer surface 4a,after being removed from the push up operation provided by push up piece 15.Consequently the second article 23a is disengaged from the second retainer member 10 and is pushed by the following goods into contact with the first retainer member 9. In this state, the article 23a is now the lowest article.In the goods discharging mecahnism of this design, the solenoid 7 and the transmission mechanism 8 are disposed on one side left side in Fig. 2A of the centre axis A of base plate 4. Therefore even if two goods discharge mechanisms are arranged back to back as illustrated in Fig. 2A and as shown by the broken line and numerals in , both mechanisms can discharge without any failure. Fig. 4 shows such an arrangement as viewed from the same side as solenoid 7.In order to make the actions clearer, one of the goods discharge mechanisms is hatched and the parts thereof are denoted by the reference numerals in Thus in the goods storage and discharge system Z of the invention two goods discharge mechanisms 6 are arranged backto back between adjacent rows of storage shelves,so that transmission mechanisms 8 and the solenoids 7 of the two mechanisms are superimposed on each other.Below a detailed description will be given with reference to Fig. 5, in which the same reference numerals are used to denote the identical parts or members as those used inFig. 2. In the automatic vending machine shown in Fig.51 there are four rows of storage shelves 3a,3b,3c, 3d disposed back to front within the body 1 of the vending machine.Two goods discharge mechanisms 6a,6b are located between the goods passages 2 of two adjacent storage shelves 3a,3b in back to back relation. Moreover two goods discharge mechanisms 6c,6d are disposed between the goods passages 2 of two adjacent storage shelves 3c,3d in back to back relation. The goods discharge mechanism 6a is positioned in the vicinity of the goods passage 2 of the storage shelf 3a, while goods discharge mechanism 6b is positioned in the vicinity of the goods passage 2 of storage shelf 3b. The mechanisms Ec and 6d are disposed in the vicinity of the goods passages of storage shelves 3c, 3d respectively.Reference numeral 24 denotes a chute common to all the storage shelves 3 and designed to guide the goods discharged by the discharge mechanisms 6 toward the outlet 5 provided in the front panel.The automatic vending machine further has an inner door 26, an anti theft door 27, a cooler 28 and a blower 29 for the circulation of chilled air.In the goods storage and discharge system for automatic vending designed in accordance with the invention, the storage shelves occupy much less space than in the conventional arrangement. In fact, in the conventional automatic vending machines, the storage shelves are mounted as shown by the line composed of two dots and dashes, so that only one goods discharge mechanism 6 is located between two adjacent storage shelves. In this case, it is necessary.to provide a mounting space D corresponding to the height H of the goods discharge mechanism 6 in each of the spaces between adjacent storage shelves 3.There fore if the conventional arrangement of goods discharge mechanism is used, it is necessary to provide additional installation space denoted by E, resulting in the correspondingly increased size of the automatic vending machine as a whole.Fig. 5B shows a conventional arrangement in which the conventional goods discharge mechanisms are arranged back toback, as well as the arrangement of the goods discharging mechanisms of the invention disposed in superimposed and back to back relation. More specifically, the conventional arrangement is shown in the upper half of Fig. SB, while the arrangement according to the invention is shown in the lower half of Fig. 5B.It will be seen that the additional space E is required by the conventional arrangement.In other words, the goods discharge and storage system of the invention requires less installation space for the storage shelves, as stated above. The goods discharge mechanism of the goods storage and discharge system of the invention may be designed as shown inFigs. 6A,6B and 7.This goods discharging mechanism will be explained in more detail below. In Figs. 6A,6B and 7, the same reference numerals have been used to denote the identical parts or members as those in Figs. 2A, 2B and 3. In Figs. 6A,6B and solenoid 7 and the transmission mechanism 8 are arranged on one side of the centre axis A of base plate 4, as is the case in goods discharge mechanism as shown in Fig.2 see Fig.7 .The transmission mechanism connected to movable core 7a includes a T shaped connecting plate 13. Reference number 30 designates a guiding plate for the connecting plate.This guiding plate 30 is fixed to base plate 4 and holds the connecting plate 13 slidably.The first retainer member 9 comprises two plates 9a, 9b.Plate 9a has a bent end which is rotatably attached to a. stationary hub 31 fixed to base plate 4, while the other end is also bent and connected to a bent end of the other plate 9b by a common pin 32, such that the first retainer member 9 can be flexed around pin 32. The other end of plate 9b is also bent and is rotatably attached to a pin 33 which penetrates connecting plate 13. The second retainer member 10 comprises two plates 10a, 1Ob which are assembled in the same way as plates 9a,9b of said first retainer member 9. According to this arrangement, when the solenoid 7 is energized in the state shown in Fig. 6A, the movable core 7a is attracted as shown in Fig. 6B to cause the motion of the connecting plate 13.When connecting plate 13 moves,pin 33 is moved accordingly to make second retainer member 10 project into the space above the goods transfer surface 4a,while retracting first retainer member 9, to permit the lowest article to be discharged.After the sale, i.e. discharge,of the article,the solenoid is de energized so that the state shown in Fig.6A is resumed due to the action of spring 18. This goods discharge mechanism can be used in the same manner as that in the embodiment shown in Fig. 5.
