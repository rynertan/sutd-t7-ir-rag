## Description
CEMENTITIOUS COMPOSITIONSField of the Invention The present invention relates to cementitious compositions comprising an hydraulic cement and a watersoluble or water dispersible organic polymer, and to cementitious products produced from such compositions.Background to the Invention Although the flexural strength of normal construct ional cements is generally low, typical values being about 5 MPa, various methods are known whereby an increase in the flexural strength may be obtained. One such method is to reinforce the cementitious composition by means of fibres, for example of asbestos, glass, steel, ceramic, synthetic resin or vegetable material. However, fibre reinforcement suffers from the disadvantages that the flexural strengths obtained are still relatively modest at about 40 MPa, that the improvement in the flexural strength may not be isotropic, and that the rheological properties of the cementitious composition may be impaired. It has also been disclosed that cementitious compositions having a higher flexural strength, typically about 150 MPa, may be prepared by mixing a water soluble or a water dispersible polymer with an hydraulic cement under conditions of high shear, as disclosed in European Patent Specification No. O,055 O35 Imperial ChemicalIndustries PLC . The polymer acts as a processing aid which permits closer packing of the cement particles than can normally be achieved. Furthermore, the amount of water that is required for processing the composition is less than that which is required for conventional cement compositions.By appropriate selection of the polymer and of the proportions in which the hydraulic cement, polymer and water are mixed together, a composition is obtained that can be rolled into a workable sheet, formed into shaped articles and used in applications hitherto open only to such materials as metals, ceramics and plastics. The only types of hydraulic cement that are described in EP A O,055,035 are aluminous cements and calcium silicate cements of the Portland type. Although calcium aluminate cement is preferred, it is a relatively expensive material. A more serious disadvantage of this type of cement is that, although the wet flexural strengths of products manufactured from it remain adequate at about 40 50 MPa, such products are liable to deformation in particular, the wet dimensional stability is poor and 5 10 swelling in water will commonly occur. Hence, for example, a decorative panel based on this material and wetted on one side by rain may warp severely.Commercial calcium silicate cements such as white Portland cement are, in general, cheaper than aluminate cements however, they too have been found to suffer from the problem of poor wet dimensional stability, which in most cases will be even more severe than with aluminate cements. Furthermore, such calcium silicate cements have the further disadvantages that their rheology in the required mix ratios is relatively poor and that they generally give much shorter working times than can be obtained with aluminate cement.Summary of the present invention The present invention provides a cementitious composition comprising an hydraulic cement and a watersoluble or water dispersible organic polymer, wherein at least 65 by weight of the hydraulic cement consists of hydraulic calcium silicate. The cementitious compositions of this invention are rendered settable by the inclusion of water and the present invention also provides a cementitious product produced by the setting of such an aqueous composition.Description of preferred embodiments The hydraulic cement consisting substantially of hydraulic calcium silicate preferably comprises at least 85 , particularly preferably at least 95 and especially at least 98 , by weight of hydraulic calcium silicate. A calcium silicate is considered hydraulic for the purposes of this invention if it shows hydraulicity under hardening conditions that are normal in cement technology, usually room temperatuJe 200C and atmospheric pressure. Suitable materials are tricalcium silicate C3S , beta dicalciurn silicate ss C2S and mixtures thereof. The C3S may be in the form of the monoclinic, triclinic or trigonal rhombohedral polymorph or a mixture of any of these. C3S in th e substantially pure form has hitherto been produced anct investigated only in the laboratory see, for example, R.T.H. Aldous, The Hydraulic Behaviour of Rhombohedral Alite , Cement and Concrete Research, Volume 13 1983 , pages 89 96. ss C S is described, for example, by L .L. Kantro and 2 C.H. Weise in Hydration of Various Dicalcium SilicatePreparations , J. Amer. Ceram. Soc., 1979, 62, pp 621 626. For the very test results, the hydraulic calcium silicate should contain as much C3S as possible. However, CSS produced on a commercial scale will casually contain a proportion commonly up to 30 , typically 20 30 , by weight of ss 2S and such a material has proved to be satisfactory. The remai .der of the hydraulic cement will normally comprise the phases C3A and or C4AF, froze lime and such inorganic materials e.g. such mineralisers as calcium fluoride as may be required in the production of the calcium silicate material and or for the stabilisation of the calcium silicate phases present in the hydraulic cement. However, the hydraulic cement should not contain more than 6 by weight of iron expressed as Fe203.Similarly, although a small amount of alumina Al203 may also be required to stabilise certain phases, the hydraulic cement should not contain more than 7 by weight af aluminate expressed as Al203. It is particularly preferred that the cement should contain not more than 1 by weight of iron expressed as Fe2Q3 and not more than 1 by weight of aluminate expressed as Al203, since above those levels they cannot be accommodated by direct substitution in the calcium silicate crystal structure.Furthermore, levels of Al203 and Fe2O3 above 1 may necessitate longer hardening times, ge explained hereinafter. The hydraulic cemeiit should contain not more than 4 by weight of sulphate, expressed as S03. With an increase in the total quantity of Al203 and Fe203, especially above 2 by freight of the hydraulic cement, there is a decrease in the amount of sulphate that can be tolerated if the tctal amount of A1203 and Fe203 in the hydraulic cement is 4 by weight or more, the amount of sulphate should be 1 by weight or less. The cementitious compositions, of the present invention may also contain, in addition to the hydraulic cement, other mineral components. This include any of the conventiongl particulate aggregates known in cement technology, for example sand any aggregate, however, preferably having a maximum particle sze of 200 Zm or less , and or any of the conventional extenders used in cement technology, for example slag fly ash, pozzolana or silica fume. Such additions will preferably have particle size distributions that will favour maximum packing densities o the asejemblies of particles making up the composite. Such aggregates and extenders which may be regarded as mineral fillers may be present if at all in an amount of, in general, up to 50 , preferably up to 30 and especially up to 15 , relative to the total weight of the hydraulic content and mineral filler. The polymer which term herein includes both homopolymers and copolymers is preferably selected such that a test composition comprising 100 parts by weight of the mineral content i.e. the hydraulic cement and, if present, any extender or aggregate , 5 parts by weight of the polymer and 16 parts by weight of water, when extruded in a capillary rheometer, undergoes an increase of at least 25 in shear stress when a ten fold increase in the shear rate of the test composition is effected when the shear rates as measured are within the l range 0.1 to 5s 1. This capillary rheometer test is described in detail in EP A 0,055,035 the teaching of which European patent specification is incorporated herein by reference . Suitable polymers include vinyl acetate polymers.Although a copolymer of vinyl acetate and a copolymerisable monomer may be employed, the preferred polymer is poly vinyl acetate . It is preferred that the vinyl acetate polymer be partially hydrolysed, the degree of hydrolysis being preferably at least 50 and particularly preferably in the range of 70 to 90 . The molecular weight of the vinyl acetate polymer will in general be at least 3,000 and up to, for example, 125,000. Other polymers that can be useful under certain circumstances but that do not pass the above rheometer test include cellulose ethers, polyacrylamides and alkylene oxide polymers. Usually, the water soluble or water dispersible organic polymer will be present in an amount of up to 15 , preferably from 1 to 15 and especially from 3 to 8 , by weight of the mineral components i.e. the hydraulic cement and, if present, the extender and aggregate in the compositions. It will be understood, of course, that the polymer component of the compositions may be constituted by two or more suitable polymers. The amount of water used to prepare a settable composition should normally be sufficient to enable a plastic composition to be obtained that can be formed into shaped articles such a composition will normally have a dough like consistency. Usually, the amount of water required is at least 5 by weight of the total composition. It is normally advantageous to use the minimum amount of water that is necessary to obtain such a composition and it is especially preferred that the amount of water should not exceed 25 by weight of the total composition. Thus, the amount of water may appropriately be less than 18 or even less than 12 by weight of the total composition. The composition of the present invention may comprise other components, for example processing aids. For example, it may be beneficial to include a plasticizer for the polymer component, for example glycerol, and or a hydration accelerator for the cement component, for example calcium chloride or calcium formate. The settable compositions of this invention may be produced simply by mixing the hydraulic cement, water, polymer and any other components. The components may be mixed in any desired order for preference, however, the dry solid components are mixed together first and the liquid components are added after, although it would also be possible for the polymer and the water to be mixed first to produce an aqueous solution or dispersion which is then mixed with the other components. A typical procedure for obtaining the settable composition involves the step of dry mixing the solid components, in partcular the mineral components the cement and, if present, mineral filler and the polymer, for a period of from 20 to 60 seconds, e.g. about 30 seconds, after which water and, if required, glycerol are added and the mixture is subjected to further mixing until a dry crumble is obtained, the further mixing stage usually taking from 20 to 90 seconds, for example about 60 seconds.The aforesaid dry mixing and wet mixing steps are typically carried out at a temperature of from 5 to 400C, preferably at ambient temperature, and under ambient conditions of humidity and atmospheric pressure. It is essential to mix the components thoroughly in order to obtain a uniform composition and this may be achieved by subjecting the mixture to high shear, for example by compounding in a bladed high shear mixer and or by passing the composition repeatedly through a twin roll mill or the like, or by vacuum extrusion. The high shear mixing step is typically carried out for one to eight minutes in order to give a homogeneous, cohesive material. The settable composition obtained by thoroughly mixing the components may be formed into shaped articles, for example rods, tubes or sheets, by extrusion moulding or compression moulding. The moulding stage may, for example, be effected at a temperature of from 15 to 1100C, typically from 80 to 1000C, under a pressure of from 2 to 20 MPa, typically from 4 to 15 MPa, for a period of from 5 minutes to 24 hours, typically from 30 to 60 minutes. Whatever the method of production however, the operation should be such as to discourage the retention of entrained air by, for example, maintaining pressure until the material has hardened sufficiently to retain its moulded shape. This process may be hastened if appropriate by maintaining the composition at an elevated temperature furthermore, the pressing may also be effected under conditions of high humidity.After release of the pressure, further curing under ambient conditions or high humidity curing may be carried out. In order to obtain good wet properties, in particular flexural strength and elastic modulus, one should ensure that sufficient hardening of the composite has occurred before the pressure is released after setting.Insufficient pressing may give a product of poor dimensional stability. The period for which a composition must be held under pressure is dependent upon the composition of the cement. It has been found that when the cement contains a significant amount of e C2S, sulphate so3 , Fe203 or A1203, it is usually necessary to effect pressing of the composition for an extended period.For instance, the presence of 3 A1203 or Fe203 may necessitate pressing times at lOd0C of 2 or 5 hours respectively whereas a composition containing 0.5 Foe 203 and or 0.5 A1203 by weight of the cement may require only 30 minutes under pressure. The cement contains preferably not more than 1 S03 ideally, it contains substantially no SO3. Preferably, no more than 30 by weight of the cement should comprise 0 C2S. The present invention permits the prdduction of cementitious compositions which have excellent wet dimensional stability, strength and flexural moduli and also excellent dry strength, modulus and rheological properties. The present invention is hereinafter illustrated in and by specific Examples, which are preceded by comparative Examples exemplifying the prior art. In theExamples, all parts and percentages are by weight, unless otherwise stated. In the analyses of the cements herein the various components are represented by the symbols customary in cement technology, where S designates SiO2,A designates A1203, F designates Fe203, and C designatesCaQ. The oxide analyses were determined by X ray fluorescence and the phase analyses by X ray diffraction.Comparative Example A A calcium aluminate cement Secar 71 was used, this having an oxide analysis of 0.4 S, 70.5 A, 0.1 F and 28.7 C, and a phase analysis of 6 C12A7, 44 CA, 30 CA2 and 20 CC Al203. 100 parts of the calcium aluminate cement and 6 parts of hydrolysed poly vinyl acetate Gohsenol KH17S were mixed dry, and 0.6 parts of glycerol and 11 parts of water were added. Further mixing produced a dry crumble, which was formed into a cohesive sheet by repeated rolling on a twin roll mill. After cutting to size the sheet was pressed in a hydraulic press between poly ethylene terephthalate sheets at a temperature of 8O0C and 5 MPa pressure for a period of 10 minutes.Upon removal from the press and after drying at 8O0C for 16 hours, the cementitious sheet had the following properties the properties of a bar of ordinary cement paste prepared by casting at a water cement ratio of 0.28 are given for comparison Calcium aluminate cement Ordinary cast cement hydrolysed poly vinyl acetate bar after 28 days sheet cure at room temperature temoe rature Flexural Strength 144 MPa 13 MPaElastic Modulus 47 GPa 8 GPaDensity 2390 kg m3 1930 mg m3 Upon total immersion of the Secar polymer sheets in water at 200C for given periods of time, the sheets were surface dried and tested without further drying.The following properties were obtained Duration of immersion 7 days 56 days Flexural Strength 93 MPa 50 MPaElastic Modulus 27 GPa 18 GPaWeight increase over dry 1.8 5.7 Thickness swelling over dry 3.3 7.3 Warpage 2.3 5.1 The warpage quoted here refers to total immersion, not one sided wetting, and is therefore the result of the combined effects of non uniform pore distribution between the two surfaces of the sheet resulting from manufacture on a roll and the characteristic response of the material in question to water absorption. The effect of singlesided wetting would be expected to be more adverse. The warpage is calculated as follows. The longitudinal dimension of the warped sheet is regarded as an arc having a chord length L in other words, L is the straight line, longitudinal distance between opposite edges of the sheet . The maximum distance, measured perpendicularly from the chord, between the sheet and the chord is X, the warpage being defined as X L expressed as a percentage. The use of composites of this type based on calcium aluminate cement for applications in a completely dry state is very attractive and can be recommended. Serious doubts about the long term durability exist however with particular reference to the dimensional stability of the sheets produced warpage and thickness swelling have been found to be of importance and would render the material unsuitable for any application involving nonuniform exposure to water, such as the cladding of buildings.Comparative Example B Sheets containing a commercial white cement of the Portland type Blue Circle Snowcrete were manufactured by a procedure similar to that used for Example A except that 12 parts of water were used. The nSnowcrete had an oxide analysis of 22.3 S, 4.5 A, 0.3 F, 67.7 C and 2.3 S03, and a phase analysis of 59 C3S, 20 C2S, 11 C3A and 1 4 The moulded sheets had the following properties after drying at 800C Flexural Strength 85 MPa Elastic Modulus 31 GPa Density 2390 kg m3 This material, although somewhat less strong than the rolled material described in Example A, is nevertheless of substantially superior dry properties to the ordinary cement material described in Example A.After immersion in water at 200C, the sheet possessed the following properties Duration of immersion 7 days 56 daysFlexural Strength 24 MPa 29 MPaElastic Modulus 16 GPa 20 GPaWeight increase over dry 11.2 13.0 Thickness increase over dry 9.4 13.0 Warpage 6.4 8.9 This Example shows that although a conventional calcium silicate cement can give material of high dry strength, the effect of water immersion is substantially more adverse than it is with the calcium aluminate cement.Dimensional stability and warpage are particularly poor.Comparative Example C A high early strength cement prepared according to the teaching of GB A 1,498,057 and containing trigonalC3S instead of the conventional monoclinic was used to manufacture sheets using a procedure similar to that ofExample A and with 11 parts of water. The high early strength cement had an oxide analysis of 22.2 S, 2.9 A, 1.3 F, 66.8 C and 3.3 S03, and a phase analysis of 69 C3S, 12 C2S, 5 C3A and 4 C4AF. The moulded cement sheets had the following properties after drying Flexural Strength 49 MPa Elastic Modulus 23 GPa Density 2290 kg m After immersion at 200C for the stated periods, the wet sheet possessed the following properties Duration of immersion 7 days 56 daysFlexural Strength 19 MPa 27 MPaElastic Modulus 12 GPa 17 GPaWeight increase over dry 14 14 Thickness swelling over dry 13 13 Warp age 5.1 7.5 The dimensional stability and flexural strength were poor.Example 1 An hydraulic cement consisting essentially of trigonal tricalcium silicate was prepared in the following manner. Calcium carbonate high grade chalk and silica ceramic grade sand were proportioned to give tricalcium silicate when blended with 1 by weight of calcium fluoride and 0.5 by weight of alumina, the resultant mixture being fired twice at 1,5000C in an open oil fired laboratory furnace for 1 hour. The clinker was ground between the burns. After the second burn, which was effected in order to reduce the free lime content, the 2 clinker was ground to a surface area of 400 m kg. The resultant hydraulic cement had an oxide analysis of 25.8 S, 0.5 A, 0.2 F and 71.0 C, and a phase analysis of 98 C35 It contained substantially no S03. The said hydraulic cement was used to manufacture sheets by means of a procedure similar to that described in Example A, except that 10 parts of water were employed.The cement polymer sheet had the following properties after drying Flexural Strength 74 MPa Elastic Modulus 39 GPa Density 2300 kg m3 After immersion in water, the wet sheet possessed the following propertiesDuration of immersion 200C 7 days 56 daysFlexural Strength 30 MPa 31 MPaElastic Modulus 28 GPa 32 GPaWeight increase over dry 6.7 6.7 Thickness swelling over dry 0.6 1.6 Warpage O 0 The most significant advantage of this composite over the prior art resides in the enhanced wet dimensional stability. This allows the possibility of exterior applications for this type of composite.A further advantage of the invention is that, although the wet strength and modulus are lower than those obtained with the calcium aluminate system, the fall in these properties on wetting is not progressive the material is of stable properties after wetting whereas the calcium aluminate shows progressive deterioration over the range of times tested.Example 2 The procedure of Example 1 was followed except that the sheet was not dried at 800C after pressing but was allowed to stand at 200C for 7 days in a normal atmosphere.The sheet had the following dry properties after this time Flexural Strength 74 MPa Elastic Modulus 30 GPa Density 2340 kg m3 After immersion in water at 200C, the sheet had the following properties Duration of immersion 7 days 56 daysFlexural Strength 39 MPa 43 MPaElastic Modulus 29 GPa 32 GPaWeight increase over dry 5.6 6.3 Thickness swelling over dry 1.2 1.8 Warpage O 0 Again the same trend was observed as in Example 1, but with enhanced strength when wet. Dimensional stability when wet remained at a good level. A further comparison is made below in terms of the wet strengths of the materials of comparative Example A and Example 2 relative to the respective dry strengths Secar 71 C3S Ex. 2 Duration of immersion 7d 56d 7d 56d of dry Flexural Strength 64 35 53 58 of dry Elastic Modulus 56 38 96 108 of Weight increase over dry 1.8 5.7 5.6 6.3 Thickness swelling over dry 3.3 7.3 1.2 1.8Warp age 2.3 5.1 0 0 This clearly demonstrates the strength retention of the particular trigonal C3S cement used when wet and shows the advantage of a stable composition.Example 3 An hydraulic cement consisting essentially of triclinic tricalcium silicate was produced as follows.Calcium carbonate high grade chalk having an alumina content of 0.4 and silica a ceramic grade sand were proportioned to give tricalcium silicate when blended with 1 of calcium fluoride. The resultant mixture was fired at 1500C for one hour in an open oilfired laboratory furnace. The resultant clinker was ground to a surface area of 400 mê kg. The cement obtained in this manner had an oxide analysis of 25.6 S, 0.3 A, 0.1 F and 71.99 C, and a phase analysis of 99 C3S having the triclinle morphology. SO3 was substantially absent. The hydraulic cement and a hydrolysed poly vinyl acetate were mixed and moulded to form sheets in a manner similar to that of Example 2, except that the mixture was hot pressed at lOOµC. The resultant sheet had the following dry properties Flexural Strength 77 MPa Elastic Modulus 28 GPa Density 2400 kg m3 After immersion in water at 200C for either 7 days or 56 days, the sheet had the following properties Duration of immersion 7 days 56 daysFlexural Strength 45 MPa 48 MPa of dry Flexural Strength 58 62Elastic Modulus 31 GPa 35 GPa of dry Elastic Modulus 111 125Weight increase over dry 4.4 4.6 Thickness swelling over dry 1.4 1.5 Warpage O 0Example 4 An hydraulic cement consisting essentially 98 percent of monoclinic tricalcium silicate was produced following the method of Example 1, except that 1.0 alumina was blended in, giving a final cement containing 1.4 A1203 and 0.1 Fe203. This cement contained substantial ly no S03. Sheets were manufactured from the hydraulic cement and hydrolysed poly vinyl acetate by the method described in Example 1, except that pressing at 800C was effected for 30 minutes with one batch of sheets batch A and for 120 minutes for another batch batch B . The sheets had the following dry properties Batch A Batch BFlexural Strength 58 MPa 86 MPaElastic Modulus 24 GPa 36 GPaDensity 2190 kg r 3 2400 kg m3 After immersion in water 20DC for either 7 or 56 days, the wet sheets possessed the following properties Batch A Batch BDuration of immersion 7d 56d 7d 56dFlexural Strength MPa 27 31 35 39Elastic Modulus GPa 22 22 32 34Weight increase over dry 10.4 12.1 5.6 6.2Thickness swelling 6.2 7.1 0.8 1.8Warpage 1.5 2.5 0.3 0.8 The above example illustrates the importance of the effect of the pressing conditions upon compositions having a high content of A1203. Example 5 An hydraulic cement consisting essentially 95 percent of triclinic tricalcium silicate was prepared following the procedure of Example 4, except that 1.2 of Fe203 was blended into the mix instead of Awl 203. This produced a cement containing 0.3 A1203 and 1.9 Fe203.This cement contained substantially no SO3. The hydraulic cement and hydrolysed poly vinyl acetate were formed into sheets as in Example 4, one batch batch A being hot pressed for 30 minutes and another batch batch B being hot pressed for 120 minutes.The resultant sheets had the following dry properties Batch A Batch BFlexural Strength 43 MPa 52 MPaElastic Modulus 17 GPa 24 GPaDensity 2400 kg m3 2350 kg m3 After immersion in water 200C for the periods stated below, the wet sheets had the following properties Batch A Batch BDuration of immersion 7d 56d 7d 56dFlexural Strength MPa 27 35 25 32Elastic Modulus GPa 13 22 28 33Weight increase over dry 7.7 10.0 4.0 4.7Thickness swelling 6.5 9.5 1.4 1.6Warpage 0.6 0.8 0.1 0.3 The above example illustrates the importance of the effect of the pressing conditions upon compositions having a high content of Fe203. Example 6 An hydraulic cement containing 99 triclinic C3S, as described in Example 3, and a hydrolysed poly vinyl acetate were mixed and then moulded into sheets using the procedure of Example 3, except that 10 of the cement was replaced by silica fume.The resultant sheets had the following dry properties Flexural Strength 66 MPa Elastic Modulus 26 GPa 3 Density 2360 kg m After immersion in water 200C for the periods stated below, the sheets had the following properties Duration of immersion 7 days 56 daysFlexural Strength 40 MPa 46 MPaElastic Modulus 28 GPa 35 GPaWeight increase over dry 4.6 5.1 Thickness swelling 0.9 1.6 Warpage O 0 The above example demonstrates that a cement polymer composite having excellent properties, especially with regard to dimensional stability, may still be obtained, even when an inert mineral filler is included.Example 7 An hydraulic cement consisting essentially 98 percent of ss C2S was prepared in the following manner.Calcium carbonate high grade chalk and silica ceramic grade sand were proportioned to give ss C2S and were mixed with 0.6 boric acid. The resultant mixture was fired at 14500C for one hour in an open oil fired laboratory furnace. The clinker was ground to a surface area of 400 mê kg. Analysis of the resultant cement indicated a content of Al2O3 of 0.3 and a content ofFe 203 of 0.3 . SO3 was substantially absent. Sheets were manufactured from the hydraulic cement and a hydrolysed poly vinyl acetate in accordance with the method of Example 1. The resultant sheets had the following dry properties Flexural strength 45 MPa Elastic modulus 24 GPa Density 2210 kg m3 After immersion in water for the stated period at 200C, the sheets exhibited the following properties Duration of immersion 7d 56d Fleui l I stiengtn 9 MPa 19 MPa Elastic modulus 7 GPa 13 GPaWeight increase over dry 10.1 12.9 Thickness swelling 1.1 2.3 Warp age 0.3 0.8 Although the hydraulic cement contained only a low concentration of A1203 and of Fe203, the wet flexural strength was poor owing to the slow rate of hydration of the C2S. The dimensional stability, however, was satisfactory. The properties of the cement polymer sheets containing the ss C S cement could be improved if, after 2 pressing as described above, the sheets were cured at 8O0C and at 100 relative humidity conditions which can be adopted for accelerated curing for 7 days and dried under ambient conditions for 7 days.Sheets that had been cured and dried in this manner exhibited the following dry properties Flexural strength 55 MPa Elastic modulus 31 GPa Relative density 2050 kg m After immersion in water for the stated period at 200C, the sheets exhibited the following wet properties Duration of immersion 7d 56dFlexural strength 17 MPa 24 MPaElastic modulus 18 GPa 24 GPaWeight increase over dry 7.5 7.7 Thickness swelling 0.1 0.6 Warpage O 0 Thus, satisfactory wet strengths and elastic moduli were achieved and the dimensional stability was excellent. Flexural strengths and moduli obtained by the present invention are at least of similar magnitudes to those of current high strength cement products, such as asbestos cement and glass fibre reinforced cement, and offer many advantages. It will of course be understood that the present invention has been described above purely by way of example, and modifications of detail can be made within the scope and spirit of the invention.
