# Valve clearance adjuster.

## Abstract
An automatic tappet adjuster for a valve operating mechanism has two components 12,14 with co operating buttress thread form screw threads 32 . The axial free play in the threads 32 sets the valve clearance. Excess clearance 56 is taken up by movement of one component 14 , acted on by spring 40 , relative to the other component 12 . The buttress thread form 32 exhibits higher friction against rota tion in one direction that in the other.
