# X ray generating system.

## Abstract
An X ray lithography system 48 has a long life target in the form of a cylindrical drum 50 which is helically rotated to allow a pulsed laser beam 14 to intersect successive adjacent areas along a helix on the drum. Thus the target is moved relative to the path of the laser beam by a predefined incremental amount after a plurality of laser beam pulses have been provided to the same spot on the target.
