## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF VITAMINIZED MILK MILK POWDER The present invention relates to te production of dry milk powders from milk vitaminised with Vitamin A. In the production of dry milk powders it is well known that the Vitamin A content of the liquid milk may be supplemented or, in the case of skim milk, restored by a process known as vitaminisation. In general there are two types of vitaminisation process the wet mixing t process and the dry blendlng process. In a wet mixing process a liquid oil based Vitamin A concentrate is added, with or without emulsification, to a small proportion of the liquid milk, to make a pre mix , which is then added back to the bulk of the milk prior to the drying operation.In m dryblending process the concentrated VIta nin A, in a beadlet form, is dry blended with the milk powder in the required proportion. Roth the convential wetmixing and the dry blending processes can be operated on a continuous, or a batch wise, basis. A disadvantage of the dry blending process of vitaminisation is that it is more difficult to obtain a homogeneous dispersion of the added vitamin. Furthermore, the element of double handling or batch blending involved in the dryblending process tends to increase production costs. The wet mixing process is thus the rt ore convenient of these two processes in practice. However, in our experience, all of the existing wet mixing techniques are subject to the disadvantage that the level of Vitamin A in the product decreases significantly on storage at temperatures of about 10 to 14 C. The rate of decrease in the Vitamin A level is particularly marked at high temperatures e.g.370C , such as may be encountered under tropical conditions.The Vitamin A level often decreases at such a rate tint, in a matter of wees, it has dropped below the generally required level of 5000 I.U. lOOg., almost regardless of the initial dosage. This instability can, of course, r csalt in the rejection of the milk powder by prospective purchasers it may also result in the consumption of a sub standard product which could, in certain circumstances, give rise to nutritional problems. This instability is, in our view, due to a number of factors as described herein The addition of an unprotected Vitamin A mixture en masse to a large bulk of raw milk e.g. the equivalent of one to two hours production results in a product of dubious and variable stability with regard to the Vitamin A shelf life. Ignoring the question of the difficulty of obtaining an even distributiori of the vitamin in a large bulk of raw milk, and the effect of agitation on the activation of milk lipases, one must consider the effect of microbIological attack, particularly with raw milk containing high counts of bacteria, on a dispersed vitamin emulsion. Raw milk contains live and proves enz yr.es, of bovine and bacterial origin, which will attack a finely dispersed fat emulsion, such as oily Vitamin A concentrates. Milk, in addition, contains pro oxidant factors which will affect any susceptible material, such as Vitamin A, and this is, in our view, a major scurce of Vitamin A instability. The rate of these effects will depend on, amongst other things, the degree of dispersion of the vitamin concentrate. The finer the dispersion the greater the surface area exposed, the more rapid the degradation of the Vitamin A due to factors detailed above. We have discovered that by carrying out a process whereby a prepared vitamIn premix, containing the appropriate ingredents and processed in the.appropriate manner, is mixed into milk, in the required proportions, we can enhance the stability of the vitaminised milk powder under both temperate and tropical conditions. The present invention provides a process for the production of vitaminised milk powder from a supply of a liquid milk product which process comprises a heat treating a small portion of the liquid milk product, b adding, to the liquid produced in a , an oil based Vitamin A concentrate, containing at least one emulsifying.agent, c emulsifying and heat treating the mixture produced in b d adding the emulsion obtained in c to the fluid milk product to be vitaminised, and e concentrating and drying the milk product to give a vitaminised milk product. Preferably the liquid milk product used in the process is skim. milk. In the process of the present invention, the portion of the liquid milk product hated in step a , above, and the liquid milk product in step c , above, are each heat treated to a sufficient degree, to activate a major portion of the naturally occurring antioxidant sulphydryl groups present in the milk protein and to stabilize the artificially created globule membrane. Typically, these heat treatments are maintained for at least one minute, preferably eight minutes, depending on heating temperature, in order to stabilize the artificially formed fat globule membrane, and to activate a major portion of the reducing sulphydryl groups. The Vitamin A concentrate is added to the portion of the milk product heat treated in a above, preferably after this has been cooled. The oil basedVitamin A concentrates used in the present invention will typically be in the form of a stabilized oily fcrlaticn of a Vitamin A ester, such as the acetate or the palmitate. Such oily concentrates are available commercially. Typically, the cily concentrate will be diluted before use with an oil, or fat, having an low peroxide value that should have no effect on the taste of the final product. Any vegetable oil, or animal fat, which fulfils these requirements may be used. Specific examples include butter coconut fat, soya oil and hardened palm kernel oil. The oil based Vitamin A concentrate contains at least one emulsifying agent to facilitate the emulsification and there after to form a protective membrane around the dispersed fat globules containing the Vitamin A. The Vitamin A concentrate preferably also contains one or more antioxidants. Suitable emulsifying agents include gelatine, glyceryl monostearate, glyceryl lactostearate, casein, calcium caseinate, whey proteins and sorbitan monostearate. The emulsification of the mixture is best carried out with the use of a homogeniser. The process of homogenisation completes the emulsification of the vitamin containing oil phase in the heat treated milk portion. The emulsification process forms an artificial membrane which helps to protect the vitamin from its micro environment. After the emulsification, the resulting emulsion.which we call the vitamin premix is heat treated at z temperature of at least 6O0C, preferably from 700 to 115 C, and then blended in the desired proportion into the bulk milk phase. Although, the addition of the premix to the bulk milk phase will cool the premix, the latter is preferably precooled before the blending stage typically to a temperature less than 10 C, preferably about 40C, to minimize microbiological deterioration. Following the addition of the vitamin premix to the liquid, the blended mixture is preferably heated, to bring about further activation of.the major portion of the milk protein sulphydryl groups, also further protecting the vitamin against the deleterious affects of its environment. The bulk liquid is then concentrated and dried by standard techniques, such as spray drying. The process of the invention may be carried out on a continuous or a batch wise basis. However, it is particularly suited to a continuous mode. Milk powders produced by the wet blending process of the present invention have a superior vitamin retention after storage at 37Or, compared with powders produced by known methods of wet blending. EREMPLE A Vitamin A premix for addition to skim milk to produce 10 tonnes of milk powder had a formulation as folows Skim Milk 900 1 Butter 20 kg Vitamin A Palmitate 1.01 kg oily form, 1.000,000 I.U. g Ascorbyl Palmitate 0.115 kg Gelatine 230 bloom 0.200 kg Glyceryl Lactostearate 3.0 kg GLS Glyceryl Monostearate GAS 4.5 kg The vitamin premix was prepared as follows The butter was melted and the temperature adjusted to 65 C. The oil based Vitamin A palmitate was added to the melted butter and was mixed until an even dispersion was obtained.To this dispersion was added a pre formed blend of GMS, GLS, ascorbyl palpitate and belatine,rfith stirring until the blend was dispersed and melted in.Care was taken not to incorporate air into the mixture.The oil blend produced was added at 650C, to the skim milk at 650C, which had previously been heat treated at 950C for 15 minutes in a homogeniser. In the homogeniser, the oil was homogenised into the skim milk phase. The circulation between the homogeniser and the balance tank was maintained for 5 minutes maintaining the homogeniser pressure , to ensure an even emulsion and subsequently heated to 91or. The resultant vitamin premix was then cooled to 4 C. Using an adjustable, positive displacement, metering pump the premix was fed into the raw skim evaporator feed at the suction side of the feed pump, at a rate to give the required vitamin level per 100.g. of powder. The raw milk premix blend was then heated at a temperature of 910C for 4 minutes.The heat treated skim milk was then evaporated and spray dried to give a vitaminised milk powder.
