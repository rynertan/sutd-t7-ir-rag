# Heating apparatus having a weight detector.

## Abstract
A heating apparatus comprises a housing 1 having a chamber 2 and a door 3 for closing the chamber, and a power supply source 4 to supply heating energy to the chamber. A door close sensor 19 is provided for detecting when the door is closed. A foodstuff is placed on a table 5 which is vertically movably mounted in the chamber on a resilient support 8 so that the table may oscillate at a frequency determined by the weight of the foodstuff. The housing may be constructed to transmit an impact to the table at the instant the door is closed, or alternatively, means 20 are provided for causing the table to oscillate at the frequency in response to the door being closed. The oscillation of the table is converted to an electrical signal and analyzed to determine the weight of the foodstuff by a control circuit 40 , which controls the power supply source in accordance with the determined weight.
