# Single track magnetic head assembly.

## Abstract
The single track magnetic head assembly comprises a non magnetic base 10 , a magnetic layer 12 disposed on one surface of said base, a non magnetic top closure 16 positioned adjacent to an upper portion of said magnetic layer, and a magnetic bridge section 18 positioned adjacent to the lower portion of said magnetic layer and below said top closure. A prewound coil 20 is attached to the bridge section. The base, the magnetic layer and the top closure have arched sections 24,26,30 to allow accurate definition of the throat height, and to enable testing of magnetic and physical properties of the magnetic head during the assem by process.
