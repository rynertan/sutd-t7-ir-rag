## Description
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR SETTING COORDINATE SYSTEM The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for setting a coordinate system, and more particularly to such a coordinate system setting method and apparatus particularly for use in entering graphics employing a tablet. A numerically controlled machine tool hereafter referred to as an NC machine tool is operated in a manner specified by a machining program stored on an NC tape to subject a workpiece to prescribed machining. To create an NC tape for a cutting operation, numerical control information and other machining conditions are punched into a paper tape in accordance with predetermined rules. The numerical control information includes all the data necessary for machining, such as numerical values obtained from a design drawing and relating to the dimensions of the workpiece that is to be machined, feed speed, and the like.When machining the workpiece by means of an NC machine tool, the NC tape which has been prepared is fed into the tape reader of a numerical control device so that the various instructions recorded on the NC tape may be read successively, the numerical control device responding by executing the read instructions to cause the machine tool to machine the workpiece as prescribed. Since considerable time and experience is required to create the information stored on an NC tape, an apparatus for preparing an NC tape automatically has recently been developed and put into practical use. The apparatus includes a graphic display, keyboard and printer and is extremely useful in preparingNC tapes in a simple, accurate and rapid manner.Such an apparatus for automatically preparing NC tapes is constituted by a microcomputer with its internal main memory for storing the NC tape preparation software, or system program. To create a machining program by means of the above described apparatus, the prescribed system program is loaded into the main memory, and a so called part program consisting of a group of data specifying the contour of a part, namely the path of a tool for cutting the contour, maust be created and entered in accordance with predetermined rules. The preparation of such a part program is troublesome. and time consuming, and can only be accomplished by a programmer having considerable programming skill. With these difficulties in view, there has been a demand for a system capable of entering graphics simply by specifying a plurality of points on such graphics, and attention has turned to a graphic entering apparatus employing a tablet. Such a graphic entering apparatus using a tablet can easily enter graphics even if the dimensions thereof are unknown. However, it has been troublesome to set and enter an NC data coordinate system.

An erlbodiment of the present invention relay further provide a method and apparatus capable of easily setting anNC data coordinate system even when no dimensions are known, and of setting and entering the reference point of an NC data coordinate system in case the reference point is located outside the read out area of a tablet. In one embodiment o, figure on a drawing placed on the read out area of a tablet is entered with a coordinate designating device by designating a plurality of points on the drawing, and at the same time a coordinate system of the figure is set and entered. To carry out the above coordinate setting, a first point on the drawing is designated by the coordinate designating device to enter the coordinates of the first point on a tablet coordinate system, and coordinates of the designated first point on an NC data coordinate system are entered through a keyboard to set a reference point of theNC data coordinate system.A second point on a straight line passing through the first point parallel to an X axis or Y axis of the NC data coordinate system is designated by the coordinate designating device to enter the coordinates of the second point on the tablet coo nate system. TheNC data coordinate system can be set and entered by employing the first and second points and the coordinates on the tablet coordinate system. The above and other features and advantages an example of of the present invention will become more apparent from the following description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which a preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown by way of illustrative example. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is a diagram illustrative of the principles of the present invention Fig. 2 is a block diagram of a system for reducing the present invention to practice Fig. 3 is a perspective view of the general features of a system for creating NC data Fig. 4 is a perspective view of a tablet input device in the system shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 5 is an enlarged, top view of a cursor unit included in the device of Fig. 4. Fig. 1 is explanatory of operations of establishing an NC data coordinate system. First, the reference pointRm of the coordinate system is set up in the following order a A point Pt on a read out area TRA and a drawingDR is designated by a coordinate designating device, and the coordinates xt, yt thereof on a tablet coordinate system are entered b The coordinates xn, yn of the designated pointPt on an NC data coor dinate system are entered through a keyboard. After the reference point of the NC data coordinate system has been determined by the foregoing steps a and b , then coordinate axes are established in the following manner a Where the tablet coordinate system Xt Yt and the NC data coordinate system Xn Yn are in parallel relationship to each other, a key on the keyboard is depressed to indicate the fact that the both coordinate systems are parallel or b Where the coordinate systems Xt Yt and Xn Yn are not parallel to each other, a or key is depressed and then a point Pt on a straight line passing through the point Pt parallel to the X axis on the NC data coordinate system Xn Yn in a direction dependent on the sign or is designated by the coordinate designating device to enter the coordinates xt , yt of the point Pt on the tablet coordinate system. The NC data coordinate system is thus set up by the foregoing procedure. Other processes than the above may be considered for setting coordinate axes. For example, a coordinate system can be established by designating a point on a straight line extending through the point Pt parallel to the Y axis. Actuation of the or key may not necessarily be required. After the NC data coordinate system has been set up, any arbitrary point Q on the drawing is designated by the coordinate designating device, and the coordinates xq, yq of the point Q on the tablet coordinate system can converted into corresponding coordinates xm, ym on the NC data coordinate system through the following coordinate transformation EMI8.1 whereEMI8.2 Fig. 2 is a block diagram of a system for reducing the present invention to practice. The apparatus includes a first register 101a for storing the cooridnates xt, yt of the point Pt on the tablet coordinate system, a second register lOlb for storing the coordinates xt , yt of the point Pt on the tablet coordinate system, and a third register lOlc for storing the coordinates xn, yn of the point Pt on the NC data coordinate system. When the coordinates xq, yq of the point Q Fig. 1 on the tablet coordinate system is entered from a tablet input device 102 into a fourth register lOld, a coordinate transformation unit 103 effects the arithmetic operations defined by the equations 1 and 2 to generate coordinate values xm, ym on the NC data coordinate system.An NC data creating unit 104 employs the coordinate values xm, ym to generate NC data which are then stored in a data memory 105.

The cursor unit 13c or stylus pen 13d is used to enter coordinate and other data. The details of the cursor unit 13c are illustrated in the enlarged view of Fig. 8, in which a top view of the cursor unit is shown. The cursor unit 13c has a main bodyCSB, first and second switches SW1, SW2, a position reader PER , a connector CNT and a cable CBL leading from the connector CNT to the main body CSB. To enter the coordinates of a point, the intersection Pc of the cross hairs provided on the position reader PR is aligned with the desired opint on a drawing laid on the tablet body, followed by depressing the first switch SW1 or the second switch SW2. embodiment of the According to the present invention, the reference point of an NC data coordinate system can easily be established, and it can be set up and entered even when the reference point is located outside the read out area of the tablet.
