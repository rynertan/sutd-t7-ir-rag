# Improvements in and relating to the production of belting.

## Abstract
Solid woven conveyor belting is produced by a process which includes the step of subjecting the fabric carcase 5 to a plurality of alternating changes of direction whilst immersed in a bath 14 of impregnant materials 15 , each of said changes of direction being effected by causing the carcase to follow a generally curved path whose radius of curvature is appreciably less than 75 mm. Prior to immersion, a synthetic polymeric yarn containing carcase may be subjected to a shrinking treatment 10 effective to shrink at least the synthetic fibre component of the carcase.
