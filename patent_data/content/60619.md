# Foldable and portable bicycle quick release latch.

## Abstract
The handlebar 25 , its elongated post 24a, 24b , the seat assembly 115, 116 , the pedal crank 135 and the frame 13 are foldable quickly and easily into a compact and regular shaped package that is easily port able and storable, and are unfoldable with similar speed and ease into a safe, durable and comfortable bicycle that accommodates adults of normal size. The frame 13 is designed with a low profile that is substantially the same in height and thickness as the dimensions of the wheels 11, 12 and their supports, and the handlebar 24 and seat assemblies 116, 115 extend upwardly to normal height, but fold and collapse, along with the pedals 19 , to substantially within the confines outlined by the folded frame. Highly effective and easily operated quick release latches 61 of the overcenter toggle type are provided at the lower end of a hinged steering post 24a and at a mid frame hinge 105 , each latch having an actuator arm 62 that normally lies in an unobtrusive position alongside one of the hinged members 24a and a con necting arm 65 that is nested in a groove in the ac tuator arm 62 . The arms are spring urged 70 to the overcenter latched condition and the effective length of the connecting arm 65 is adjustable by means of oppositely threaded connections at its ends.
