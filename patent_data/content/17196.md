## Abstract
Radio apparatus and in particular VHF transmitter and receiver apparatus for aeronautical use comprises a frequen cy synthesiser 17 which is able to generate any desired frequency within the range of the radio and a number of frequency channel selection devices. These selection devices include a channel tuning switch 11, 11 which is arranged on the front panel of the apparatus and which can be adjusted to select any desired channel within the frequency range of the radio and a number of channel selectors 12, 12 13, 13 14, 14 which can be preset to call up certain fixed channels as desired. A changeover switch 16a at the front panel of the apparatus makes it possible to select any one of the channel selectors 12, 12 13, 13 14, 14 or the channel tuning switch 11, 11 . All the channel tuning devices are of similar construction and are mechanical stepping switches but the adjacent devices for the fixed channel selectors can only be actuated by means of tools. The selected channel is indicated on a liquid crystal display 18 .
