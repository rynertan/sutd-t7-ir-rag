# HEAT COOKING DEVICE.

## Abstract
A safety device for a heat cooking device having an electronic control circuit 28 for controlling a main circuit for supplying electric power to a heating source. When the heat cooking device having the circuit 28 employs a mechanical latch unit and a cooking start button 7 is depressed, a start signal switch 29 and an opening and closing signal switch 30 in the circuit 28 are operated with a plurality of door switches 16 , 27 . Thus, the circuit 28 initiates operation to turn on switch 31 in the main circuit of the heating source such as a high frequency generator circuit 32 or the like. Thus, it can prevent the danger of the cooking device spontaneously turning on due to a self trigger from external noise or a malfunction in the circuit 28 .
