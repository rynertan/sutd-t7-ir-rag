## Description
This invention relates to a method for processing a light sensitive silver halide photographic material hereinafter referred to as a light sensitive material , more particularly to a method for processing a light sensitive silver halide photographic material in which the water washing processing step has been omitted and which can give a light sensitive material with little contamination generated on its surface and also improved in relation to staining caused by the sensitizing dye. Light sensitive materials are generally processed after imagewise exposure according to the processing steps of color developing, bleaching, fixing, stabilizing, bleach fixing, water washing, etc. In the water washing step subsequent to the processing with a processing solution having fixing ability, a thiosulfate which is a compound reactive with a silver halide to form a water soluble complex, other water soluble silver complexes and further sulfites or metabisulfites as preservative may be contained in or present on the light sensitive material, entrained into the water washing step these give a deleterious influence to the storability of images if the amount of washing water is small, as is well known in the art. Accordingly, for improving such a drawback, the salts as mentioned above are washed away from the light sensitive material using a large amount of running water in the washing after processing with a processing solution having fixing ability. However, in recent years, for economical reasons such as a shortage of water resources, increased costs in sewage fees and utilities as well as for environmental reasons, there has been a desire to employ processing steps in which the amount of washing water is reduced and countermeasures against pollution are taken. Such countermeasures include a method in which water is permitted to flow countercurrently with the use of a water washing tank which has a multi stage structure as disclosed in West German Patent No. 29 20 222 and S.R. Goldwasser Water Flow Rate in Immersion Washing of Motion Picture Film , SMPTE. Vol. 64, pp. 248 253, May 1955 , etc. Also known is a method in which a preliminary water washing is provided immediately after the fixing bath to reduce the pollutative components contained in or present on the light sensitive material and entrained into the water washing step and also reduce the amount of washing water. However, these techniques do, nevertheless, employ washing water. Thus, with the situation in recent years, where water resources are exhausted and the cost of washing with water is increasing due to increasing costs of crude oil, this problem is becoming more serious. There is also a processing method in which stabilizing processing is performed immediately after photographic processing without washing with water. For example, silver stabilizing processing with a thiocyanate has been known as disclosed in U.S Patent No. 3,335,004. However, this method involves the drawback of causing contamination on the surface of the light sensitive material after drying, because a large amount of inorganic salts is contained in the stabilizing bath. Further, other disadvantages such as generation of stain and a deterioration of the dye images during prolonged storage appear when these stabilizing processes are performed. GB A 1111428 discloses a method of processing in which, after development and fixing, the material is washed and then stabilised with a solution containing a polyethoxy ethanol wetting agent. Research Disclosure No. 131, page 46, Abstract No. 13142 discloses the use of an ammonium salt of an alkylaryl polyether sulphate in the final rinse bath. US A 4336324 discloses a method of processing whereby, after fixing, the material is processed without a substantial washing process in a plurality of stabilisation baths which are replenished by a multistage counterflow system under specified volume conditions, with at least the final bath having a pH of 2 to 6.5 Acccordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a method for processing a light sensitive material substantially without use of washing water, which has low energy costs and low pollution, while, at the same time, not giving rise to contamination and staining on the surface of the light sensitive material, or deterioration of the dye images during prolonged storage. The present inventors have made extensive studies and consequently found that the above objects can be accomplished by processing a light sensitive silver halide photographic material which comprises processing a light sensitive silver halide photographic material subjected to imagewise exposure with a processing solution having fixing ability, and thereafter processing said material with a first stabilizing solution having a surface tension of 20 to 78 dyne cm mN m at 20 C in an amount not exceeding 6000 ml per m² of light sensitive material and a second stabilizing solution having a surface tension of 8 to 60 dyne cm mN m at 20 C in an amount not exceeding 6000 ml per m² of light sensitive material, any washing with running water not exceeding 6000 ml per m² of light sensitive material. According to a preferred embodiment, it has also been found that the method of the present invention is more effective when the first stabilizing solution is endowed with at least one fungicidal means as shown below Further, according to another preferred embodiment, it has also been found that the objects of the present invention can be accomplished more effectively when the second stabilizing solution contains 0.7 x 10 ⁵ to 1500 x 10 ⁵ mole liter of a thiosulfate. Further, according to still another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the objects of the present invention can be accomplished more effectively when said light sensitive silver halide photographic material contains at least one of the compounds represented by the formula 1 shown below This invention will be explained in detail below. The stabilizing processing omitting substantially the water washing step brings a large amount of the components of the fixing solution or bleach fixing solution or soluble silver complexes and decomposed products thereof into the stabilizing solution as described above in the case of continuous processing where stabilizing processing is performed directly after processing with a fixing or bleach fixing processing these components will be attached to the surface of a the light sensitive material to cause contamination thereon after processing. Particularly, in the case of a light sensitive material having a transparent support, such contamination poses a great problem. Accordingly, it is the general practice to use a processing method to permit none of the fixing solution or bleach fixing solution components and soluble silver complexes to become attached so that no such contamination may be caused. However, these methods are counter to the objects of cost reduction and lowering pollution as mentioned above. Therefore, contamination on the light sensitive material surface after processing particularly in the case of a light sensitive material having a transparent support and the stabilizing processing with low cost and lower pollution have been considered to be antagonistic to each other and, in spite of a large number of studies hitherto made, no satisfactory result has yet been obtained. Further, in performing such a stabilizing process, the problem of stain generation, which is considered to be caused by a sensitizing dye, has recently been found, and it is very important to solve this problem. We have made extensive studies in order to overcome these problems, and have found surprisingly that the above objects of the present invention can be accomplished by using two different kinds of stabilizing solutions having surface tensions within specific ranges, substantially without performing the water washing step. This was surprising and entirely unexpected from a knowledge of the prior art. The surface tension of the stabilizing solution to be used for the processing of the present invention is measured according to the general measuring method as described in Analysis and Testing Method of Surfactants by Fumio Kitahara, Shigeo Hayano Ichiro Hara, published on March 1, 1982, by Kodansha K.K. , etc., and it is the value obtained according to such conventional general measuring method at 20 C. Each of the first stabilizing solution and the second stabilizing solution of the present invention may be contained in either a single tank or a multi stage tank. In the case of a multi stage tank, there may be employed a countercurrent system in which supplemental solution is added from the tank in the final stage and transferred successively through overflow to the tanks in the preceding stages. However, the system of overflow may also include, in addition to the system in which overflow is conducted simply, the system in which overflow is dealt with in a more complicated way. For example, the solution once overflowed is pooled and then permitted to flow successively into the tanks in the preceding stages by means of e.g. bellows pumps. The first stabilizing solution tank and the second stabilizing solution tank are independent of each other. If the overflowed solution in the second stabilizing solution tank is permitted to flow into the first stabilizing solution or, vice versa, troubles such as generation of contamination on the surface of a light sensitive material and deterioration in storability of stabilizing solution will occur. Thus, in the present invention, it is required that both stabilizing solution tanks should be independent of each other. The second stabilizing solution of the present invention may be a solution of any material which can give a surface tension of 8 to 60 dyne cm 20 C , but is preferably a surfactant. Particularly, at least one compound selected from the compounds of the formula II , the formula III shown below and water soluble organic siloxane compounds may be used. In the above formula, A represents a monovalent organic group, for example an alkyl group having 6 to 20, preferably 6 to 12, carbon atoms, such as hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl or dodecyl or an aryl group substituted with one or more alkyl groups having 3 to 20 carbon atoms, preferably alkyl groups having 3 to 12 carbon atoms, such as propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl or dodecyl. The aryl group may be phenyl, tolyl, xylyl, biphenyl or naphthyl, for example, preferably phenyl or tolyl. The position of the aryl group at which the alkyl groups are bonded may be either ortho , meta or para position. B represents an ethylene oxide or propylene oxide unit, and In the above formula, each of R₄, R₅, R₆ and R₇ independently represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group or a phenyl group, and the total number of the carbon atoms of R₄, R₅ The water soluble organic siloxane compound used in the present invention is a water soluble organic siloxane compound in general as disclosed in, for example, Japanese Provisional Patent Publication No. 18333 1972, Japanese Patent Publication No. 51172 1980, Japanese Patent Publication No. 37538 1976, Japanese Provisional Patent Publication No. 62128 1974 and U.S. Patent No. 3,545,970. In the following, typical examples of the compounds represented by the formulae II and III , and water soluble organic siloxane compounds are listed. Of the above water soluble organic siloxane compounds, above all the compounds represented by the formula IV shown below are more preferably used. In the above formula, R₈ represents a hydrogen atom, a hydroxy group, a lower alkyl group, an alkoxy group, Each of R₉, R₁₀ and R₁₁ independently represents a lower alkyl group preferably an alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl or propyl , and the above R₉ In the present invention, of these compounds capable of giving a surface tension of the second stabilizing solution of 8 60 dyne cm, above all those capable of giving a surface tension of 15 45 dyne cm are particularly preferably employed. The compounds represented by the above formulae II , III and water soluble organic siloxane compounds may be used either singly or in combination. Further, they can be added in amounts within the range from, say, 0.01 to 20 g per liter of the stabilizing solution to exhibit good effect. For the first stabilizing solution of the present invention, any solution may be used, which has a surface tension of 20 78 dyne cm 20 C . For example, ordinary water may be used. In the present invention, of the compounds capable of giving a surface tension of the first stabilizing solution of 20 78 dyne cm, above all those capable of giving a surface tension of 50 75 dyne cm are particularly preferably employed. As the compounds to be added into the first and second stabilizing solution, in addition to those mentioned above, there may be added various additives for improving and expanding the processing effect, such as fluorescent whitening agents organic sulfur compounds onium salts film hardeners chelating agents pH controllers such as boric acid, citric acid, phosphoric acid, acetic acid, or sodium hydroxide, sodium acetate or potassium citrate organic solvents such as methanol, ethanol or dimethyl sulfoxide dispersants such as ethylene glycol or polyethylene glycol other color controllers, as desired. The method for feeding the stabilizing solution according to the present invention is preferably practiced in the case of a multi stage countercurrent system by adding it into the later bath, which is then subjected to overflow from the former bath. There may be employed any method in which the compounds are fed as a concentrated solution into the stabilizing tank, a method in which the above compounds and other additives are added to the stabilizing solution to be fed into the stabilizing tank to provide a feed solution for the stabilizing solution, or a method in which they are added to the bath preceding the stabilizing processing step to be incorporated in the light sensitive material to be processed, or other various methods. In the present invention, the pH values of the respective stabilizing solutions is preferably 4 to 9. This is because silver sulfide tends to be generated at a pH lower than 4 which cause problems such as clogging of filter, while water slime or microorganisms tend to be generated at a pH over 9. Thus, the stabilizing solutions of the present invention are preferably used at the pH range from 4 to 9. The pH may be controlled by use of a pH controller as mentioned above. The processing temperature in each stabilizing processing is suitably from 15 C to 60 C, preferably from 20 C to 45 C. The processing time, which should preferably be as short as possible from the viewpoint of rapid processing, is generally 20 seconds to 10 minutes, most preferably one minute to 5 minutes, with a shorter processing time being preferred for the earlier stage tank and longer processing time for the later stage tank. The processing solution having fixing ability used in the present invention means a processing solution containing a solubilizing complexing agent which is solubilized as silver halide complex, including not only fixing solutions in general but also bleach fixing solutions, one bath developing fixing solution and one bath developing bleach fixing solution. The effect of the present invention can be greater when a bleach fixing solution or a fixing solution is used. As the solubilizing complexing agent, there may be included, for example, thiosulfates such as potassium thiosulfate, sodium thiosulfate, and ammonium thiosulfate thiocyanates such as potassium thiocyanate or sodium thiocyanate, ammonium thiocyanate or thiourea, thioether, highly concentrated bromides or iodides, as typical examples. Particularly, the fixing solution should desirably contain a thiosulfate. In the present invention, substantially without performing the water washing step means carrying out the first and second stabilizing processings by a single tank or multi tank countercurrent system after processing with a processing solution having fixing ability, but there may also be included the processing steps other than water washing in general, such as rinsing processing, auxiliary water washing and known water washing promoting bath. Any washing with running water should not exceed 6000ml per m² of light sensitive material. After each stabilizing processing of the present invention, no water washing processing is required, but it is possible to provide a processing tank for the purpose of rinsing with a small amount of water within a very short time, surface washing with a sponge and image stabilization or controlling the surface characteristics of the light sensitive material. In the present invention, when a specific chelating agent is used in the first stabilizing solution, there is generally an improvement in the storage stability of said first stabilizing solution. The chelating agent preferably used in the first stabilizing solution of the present invention has a chelate stability constant of 8 or higher with iron III ions. The chelate stability constant indicates the stability of a complex of a metal ion and the chelate in a solution, which means the constant defined as the reciprocal of the dissociation constant of the complex, which is generally known see L.G. Sillen A.E. Martell, Stability Constants of Metal Ion Complexes , The Chemical Society London 1964 , and S. Chaberek, A.E. Martell Organic Sequestering Agents Wiley 1959 , etc. The chelating agents having chelate stability constants with iron III ions of 8 or more include polyphosphates, aminopoly carboxylates, oxycarboxylates, polyhydroxy compounds, organic phosphates and fused phosphates. Particularly good results can be obtained when aminopolycarboxylates or organic phosphates are employed. Specific examples of chelating agents are set forth below. The chelating agent may be used either singly or as a combination of two or more compounds, and its amount is suitably within the range of 0.05 g to 40 g, preferably 0.1 to 20 g, per liter of the stabilizing solution. Of these chelating agents, particularly preferred is 1 hydroxyethylidene 1,1 diphosphonic acid. The amount of the first and second stabilizing solutions is 6000 ml or less, preferably 20 ml to 4000 ml, per 1 m² of the light sensitive material. The fungicide preferably used in each stabilizing solution used in the present invention is a hydroxybenzoic acid ester, phenol, thiazole, pyridine, guanidine, carbamate, morpholine, quaternary phosphonium, ammonium, urea, isoxazole, propanolamine, sulfamide or amino acid compound. The aforesaid hydroxybenzoic acid ester compounds include methyl ester, ethyl ester, propyl ester or butyl ester, for example, of hydroxybenzoic acid, preferably n butyl ester, isobutyl ester or propyl ester of hydroxybenzoic acid, more preferably a mixture of these three esters of hydroxybenzoic acid. The phenolic compounds are exemplified by phenol compounds which may have C₁ C₆ alkyl group, halogen atom, a nitro group, a hydroxy group, a carboxyl group, an amino group, an alkoxy group, a cycloalkyl group or a phenyl group, for example, as substituent, preferably o phenylphenol, o cyclohexylphenol, nitrophenol, chlorophenol, cresol, guaiacol, aminophenol and phenol. The thiazole compounds are compounds having a nitrogen atom and a sulfur atom in a five membered ring, preferably 1,2 benzisothiazoline 3 one, 2 methyl 4 isothiazoline 3 one, 2 octyl 4 isothiazoline 3 one, 5 chloro 2 methyl 4 isothiazoline 3 one and 2 chloro 4 thiazolyl benzimidazole. Suitable pyridine compounds include 2,6 dimethylpyridine, 2,4,6 trimethylpyridine and sodium 2 pyridinethiol 1 oxide, preferably sodium 2 pyridinethiol 1 oxide. Guanidine compounds which may be used include cyclohexidine, polyhexamethylene biguanidine hydrochloride, dodecylguanidine hydrochloride, preferably dodecyl guanidine and salts thereof. The carbamate compounds include methyl 1 butylcarbamoyl 2 benzimidazolecarbamate and methylimidazolecarbamate. Typical examples of morpholine compounds are 4 2 nitro butyl morpholine and 4 3 nitrobutyl morpholine. Quaternary phosphonium compounds include tetraalkylphosphonium salts and tetraalkoxyphosphonium salts, preferably tetraalkylphosphonium salts, more specifically tri n butyl tetradecylphosphonium chloride and tri phenyl nitrophenylphosphonium chloride. Quaternary ammonium compounds include benzalkonium salts, benzethonium salts, tetraalkylammonium salts, alkylpyridinium salts, specifically dodecyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride, dodecyldimethylammonium chloride and laurylpyridinium chloride. Typical examples of urea compounds are N 3,4 dichlorophenyl N 4 chlorophenyl urea and N 3 trifluoromethyl 4 chlorophenyl N 4 chlorophenyl urea. Isooxazole compounds include 3 hydroxy 5 methylisoxazole. Propanolamine compounds include n propanols and isopropanols, specifically DL 2 benzylamino 1 propanol, 3 diethylamino 1 propanol, 2 dimethylamino 2 methyl 1 propanol, 3 amino 1 propanol, isopropanolamine, diisopropanolamine and N,N dimethyl isopropanolamine. Sulfamide compounds include o nitrobenzene sulfamide, p aminobenzene sulfamide, 4 chloro 3,5 dinitrobenzene sulfamide and α amino p toluene sulfamide. A typical example of an amino acid compounds is N lauryl β alanine. Among the fungicides mentioned above, those preferably used in the present invention are thiazole compounds, pyridine compounds, guanidine compounds, and quaternary ammonium compounds. Particularly preferred are thiazole compounds. If the amount of the fungicide added to the stabilizing solution is less than 0.002 g per liter of the stabilizing solution, the desired effect is generally not realised, while an amount over 50 g is economically disadvantageous and also tends to cause a deterioration in the storage stability of the dye image. Thus, it is suitably employed in an amount within the range from 0.002 g to 50 g, preferably from 0.005 g to 10 g. Passing of the stabilizing solution through a magnetic field as mentioned above refers to passing the stabilizing solution through a magnetic field generated between the positive pole and the negative pole of a magnet the light sensitive material may be passed therethrough or not. The magnetic field to be used in the present invention may be obtained using permanent magnets, comprising iron, cobalt, nickel, or by passing direct current through a coil it is not particularly limited and all means capable of forming a magnetic field may be used. The magnetic field may be formed either by use of one magnet to form lines of magnetic force or by use of two opposed magnets positive pole and negative pole to form lines of magnetic force between the magnets. The permanent magnet may be provided in and or outside of the stabilizing solution and moved including rotation , or the stabilizing solution can be moved by stirring or circulation. A particularly desirable method is to fix a permanent magnet on a part or all of the inner portion or outer portion of the circulation system pipe and circulate the stabilizing solution. For fixing individually on the whole pipe, the pipe itself may be a permanent magnet or alternatively said permanent magnets may be mounted on the whole of said pipe. In the case of an automatic processing machine, permanent magnets, etc. can be provided in the stabilizing bath, but it is preferred to provide them in the circulation system for the stabilizing bath as mentioned above not merely the circulation pipe, but also the tanks or other parts in the course of circulation . When the stabilizing processing step involves a multi stage stabilizing bath, it is most preferred to pass the stabilizing solution in all the stabilizing baths through a magnetic field, but it is also preferred to pass the stabilizing solution in the stabilizing baths other than the stabilizing bath nearest to the processing solution having fixing ability through the magnetic field. Preferably the inside of the stabilizing bath may be provided with a resin lining incorporating a material capable of generating lines of magnetic force therein this lining can also be applied to the circulation system. Thus, the stabilizing solution can be passed through a magnetic field. Irradiation with UV rays of the stabilizing solution may be practiced in the present invention by means of commercially available UV ray lamps or UV ray irradiating devices in general, preferably a UV ray lamp with an output of 5 W to 800 W tube output . According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the UV rays have a wavelength within the range from 220 nm to 350 nm. Further, as the irradiation method, UV ray irradiating means may be placed in the stabilizing solution or outside of the stabilizing solution to effect direct irradiation thereon, or alternatively said UV rays may be irradiated onto the light sensitive material to be processed. The fungicidal means promote the desired effect of the present invention particularly when applied to the first stabilizing solution, but particularly preferably when applied to the second stabilizing solution, since this enhances further solution storability. In the processing of the present invention, silver may be recovered from the stabilizing solutions, as a matter of course, and also from the processing solutions containing soluble silver salts such as the fixing solution or bleach fixing solution, according to various methods. For example, the electrolytic method disclosed in French Patent No. 2,299,667 , the precipitation method disclosed in Japanese Provisional Patent Publication No. 73037 1977, West German Patent No. 23 31 220 , the ion exchange method disclosed in Japanese Provisional Patent Publication No. 17114 1976, West German Patent No. 25 48 237 and the metal substitution method disclosed in British Patent No. 1,353,805 , may effectively be utilized. Further, the above soluble silver salts may be subjected to silver recovery by recovering the overflowed processing solution according to the method as mentioned above, with the residual solution being either disposed of as waste solution or used as supplemental solution or tank processing solution with the addition of a regenerant. It is particularly preferred to mix the stabilizing solution with fixing solution or bleach fixing solution before carrying out silver recovery. It is also possible to treat the stabilizing solution of the present invention by contact with ion exchange resin, electrodialysis treatment see Japanese Patent Application No. 96352 1984 or reverse osmosis treatment see Japanese Patent Application No. 96352 1984 . In the present invention, when the thiosulfate concentration in the second stabilizing solution is 0.7 x 10 ⁵ to 1500 x 10 ⁵ mole 1, the desired effect of the present invention can better be exhibited, and still another effect of improvement of prolonged storability of the dye image is also exhibited, and therefore it is preferred to use a thiosulfate within the above range. Further, particularly when a thiosulfate is employed within the range of from 2 x 10 ⁵ to 200 x 10 ⁵ mole 1, particularly good results can be obtained. The thiosulfate concentration in the second stabilizing solution, when the second stabilizing solution is contained in two or more tanks, refers to the thiosulfate concentration in the tank nearest to the drying step, or, in the case of a single tank, to the thiosulfate concentration in the single tank. In the present invention, among these embodiments, the second stabilizing tank consisting of a single tank is more preferred from the standpoint of making automatic processing machines more compact. The first and second stabilizing tanks may also have a circulation pump and a filter device arranged therein, as desired. The processing steps used in the present invention may be as follows The light sensitive material to be used in the processing of the present invention preferably contains a sensitizing dye represented by the formula I shown below In the above formula, each of Z₁ and Z₂ represents a group of atoms necessary for forming a benzene ring or a naphthalene ring fused to the oxazole ring. The heterocyclic ring nucleus formed may be substituted with various substituents, preferably halogen atoms, aryl groups, alkenyl groups, alkyl groups or alkoxy groups. More preferable substituents are halogen atoms, phenyl groups and methoxy groups, most preferably phenyl groups. Preferably, both of Z₁ and Z₂ represent benzene rings fused to the oxazole rings, at least one of which benzene rings being substituted with a phenyl group at the 5 position of the benzene ring, or one benzene ring being substituted with a phenyl group at the 5 position and the other benzene ring with a halogen atom at the 5 position. Each of R₁ and R₂ represents an alkyl group, an alkenyl group or an aryl group, preferably an alkyl group. More preferably, each of R₁ and R₂ is an alkyl group substituted with a carboxyl group or a sulfo group, most preferably a sulfoalkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, especially sulfoethyl group. R₃ represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, preferably a hydrogen atom or an ethyl group. X₁ represents an anion, and The sensitizing dye represented by the formula I may also be employed in the so called color strengthening sensitizing combination in combination with the other sensitizing dye. In this case, the respective sensitizing dyes are dissolved in the same or different solvents these solutions may be mixed together before addition to the emulstion, or alternatively they can be added separately to the emulsion. When added separately, the order of addition and the time intervals may be determined as desired depending on the purpose. Specific sensitizing dye represented by the formula I are shown below. The timing at which the sensitizing dye represented by the above formula I is added to the emulsion may be at any time in the course of the step of preparing the emulsion, preferably during chemical ripening or after chemical ripening. The amount added is preferably 2 x 10 ⁶ mole to 1 x 10 ³ mole, more preferably 5 x 10 ⁶ mole to 5 x 10 ⁴ mole, per mole of silver halide. The silver halide emulsion which can be used in the present invention may employ any silver halides such as silver chloride, silver bromide, silver iodide, silver chlorobromide, silver chloroiodide, silver iodobromide and silver chloroiodobromide. Also, as a protective colloid for these silver halides, in addition to natural products such as gelatin, various synthetic compounds may be used. The silver halide emulsion may also contain conventional additives for photography such as stabilizers, sensitizers, film hardeners, sensitizing dyes and surfactants. As the support, there may be employed any material such as polyethylene coated paper, triacetate film, polyethylene terephthalate film or white polyethylene terephthalate film, but in the present invention, a material having a transparent support is particularly preferred. The light sensitive material for which the present invention is applicable may be any light sensitive materials such as color paper, reversal color paper, color positive film, color reversal film, direct positive paper and light sensitive materials for diffusion photography. The present invention is further illustrated in detail below in the following Examples. On a triacetate film base were provided a halation preventive layer and a gelatin layer, followed by coating a green sensitive silver halide emulsion layer thereon to a total silver quantity of 18 mg 100 cm². As the magenta coupler, 6 methyl 3 2,4,6 trimethyl benzyl 1H pyrazolo 3,2 C s triazole was employed, and conventional additives such as a high boiling point solvent, a film hardener and an extender were employed. As the sensitizing dye, the sensitizing dye SD 1 shown below was employed. This emulsion composition was applied on the base to prepare a sample of a silver halide color negative film light sensitive material. The above color negative film subjected to white grading exposure by means of KS 7 type sensitometer produced by Konishiroku Photo Industry K.K. was processed according to the following steps. The color developing solution employed had the following composition. made up to one liter with addition of water and adjusted to pH 10.06 using potassium hydroxide or 20 sulfuric acid . The bleaching solution employed had the following composition. made up to one liter with addition of water and adjusted to pH 6.0 using glacial acetic acid or aqueous ammonia . The fixing solution employed had the following composition. made up to one liter with addition of water and adjusted to pH 7.4 using conc. aqueous ammonia or acetic acid . As the first and the second stabilizing solutions, water adjusted to pH 7 by addition of 0.03 of the above fixing solution was employed. In the first and second solutions, the additives as shown in Table 1 were added and the surface tension at 20 C of each solution was measured by a surface tensiometer before carrying out the processing of the color negative film sample following the processing steps as mentioned above. For the film samples after processing, contamination on the film surface was observed. Also, for the samples after completion of developing, the magenta density at the maximum density portion was measured by means of PDA 65 Model photoelectric densitometer produced by Konishiroku Photo Industry Co., Ltd. and then the samples were stored under a xenon light source 70,000 lux at 60 C, 60 RH, and thereafter the portion previously measured was again subjected to measurement for determination of the fading percentage of the magenta density. The results are summarized in Table 1. From the above Table 1, it can be appreciated that only the samples processed with the first stabilizing solution having a surface tension falling within the range from 20 to 78 dyne cm and the second stabilizing solution having a surface tension falling within the range from 8 to 60 dyne cm are surprisingly free from contamination on the film surface and also lack of fading of dye is very good. In the first stabilizing solution in Example 1 Samples Nos. 1 5 , as a fungicidal means, each 0.4 g l of fungicides 2 methyl 4 isothiazoline 3 one, sodium 2 pyridinethiol 1 oxide, dodecyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride, or dodecylguanidine was added, and the same experiment as in Example 1 was carried out. The results are shown in Table 2. From the above Table 2, it can be appreciated that contamination on the film surface can be avoided by addition of the fungicidal means and also that the fading percentage of dye can further be improved. In the circulation system of the first stabilizing tank in Example 1, a magnet water activator having a permanent magnet 1 and 1 2 unit, produced by Algarid Co., in Australia was set, and the same experiment as in Example 1 was conducted. The same results as described above Experiment 1 were obtained. In the first stabilizing tank in Example 1, a UV ray lamp GL 15 wavelength 254 nm produced by Tokyo Shibaura Denki K.K. was set, and the same experiment as in Example 1 was conducted. The same results as described above Experiment 1 were obtained. The same experiment as in Example 1 was repeated except for varying the concentration of ammonium thiosulfate in the second stabilizing solution used in Example 2 Experiment 1 as shown in Table 3. The results are summarized in Table 3. From the above Table 3, it can be seen that both contamination and fading percentage of dye are good when the thiosulfate concentration in the second stabilizing solution is 0.7 x 10 ⁵ to 1500 x 10 ⁵ mole 1, all performances being very good particularly when it is 2 x 10 ⁵ to 200 x 10 ⁵ mole 1. A mixture of 5 g of 1 2,4,6 trichlorophenyl 3 2 chloro 5 octadecenylsuccinimidoanilino 5 pyrazolone as the magenta coupler, 3.0 g of tricresyl phosphate as a high boiling point organic solvent and 20 g of ethyl acetate, and optionally a necessary amount of dimethylformamide was dissolved by heating to 60 C, and then the resultant solution was mixed with 100 ml of an aqueous 5 gelatin solution containing 10 ml of an aqueous 5 solution of Alkanol B alkylnaphthalenesulfonate, produced by Du Pont Co. , followed by emulsification by a ultrasonic dispersing machine to obtain a dispersion. Next, the dispersion was added to a silver chlorobromide emulsion containing 20 mole silver chloride sensitized with SD 1 so that the magenta coupler is 10 mole based on silver, and further 1,2 bis vinyl sulfonyl ethane was added as the film hardener at a proportion of 12 mg per gram of gelatin. The mixture obtained was applied on a polyethylene coated paper support to a coated silver quantity of 4 mg 100 cm². The color paper as prepared above was subjected to the processing solutions and the processing steps shown below. In an automatic processing machine, the color developing tank solution, the bleach fixing tank solution, and the stabilizing solutions as described above were filled and, while processing a color paper subjected to picture printing exposure, the supplemental color developing solutions, the supplemental bleach fixing solutions A, B and the stabilizing supplemental solutions were supplemented at every three minutes through quantitating cups for continuous processing. The amounts supplemented were, per 1 m² of the color paper, 170 ml for the color developing tank, 25 ml each of the supplemental bleach fixing supplemental solutions A and B for the bleach fixing tank and 300 ml for the stabilizing tanks respectively. The stabilizing tanks in the automatic processing machine were made the first to the third tanks in the direction of the flow of light sensitive materials, and a multi stage countercurrent system was employed in which supplemental solutions were fed into the final tank, overflow from which was permitted to flow to the tank of the preceding stage, and further the overflow from this stage was permitted to flow into the tank of the stage precedent to said stage. The continuous processing was conducted until the total supplemental stabilizing solution was 3 fold the stabilizing tank volume to process the color paper sample as prepared above. The first stabilizing solution in the third tank the final tank and the second stabilizing solution after continuous processing were subjected to measurement of surface tension in a conventional manner. Also, contamination on the color paper surface and stain at the unexposed portion were observed with the human eye. The same experiment as in Experiment 1 was performed except for replacing the second stabilizing solution in the above Experiment 1 with water. The above Experiment 1 was repeated except that the second stabilizing solution was removed to omit processing with the second stabilizing solution. The above Experiment 1 was repeated except that the first stabilizing solution was removed to omit processing with the first stabilizing solution. The results are summarized in Table 4. From the above Table 4, it can be seen that no good results as regards both contamination on the color paper surface and stain can be obtained using either one of the first stabilizing solution and the second stabilizing solution, and further that both of the above characteristics are good only when the surface tensions of the first and the second stabilizing solutions are controlled to 20 78 dyne cm and 8 60 dyne cm, respectively. The experiments were conducted in the same manner as in Example 4 except for using the exemplary compound I 12 in place of the sensitizing dye SD 1 used in the color paper in Example 4. As a result, lack of contamination on the color paper surface was good, and lack of stain was further improved.
