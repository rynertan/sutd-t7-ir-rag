When the solenoid is energized, the solfienoid, the fixed core, the movable core and the covering means cooperate to form a magnetic loop for displacing the valve body. The covering means is fixed to the main valving unit by fastening means, with the radially extending flange of the fixed core interposed between them. Sealing means are provided for sealing in liquidtight manner between the fixed core and the tubular member, between the tubular member and the covering means, and between the main valving unit and the fixed core.

The above and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will be more apparent from the ensuing detailed description taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is a view illustrating a solenoid operated valve for oil hydraulic circuits, according to one embodiment of the invention, with its right half shown in longitudinal section and Fig. 2 is a view similar to Fig. 1, illustrating another embodiment of the invention.DETAILED DESCRIPTION The invention will now be described in detail with reference to the drawings. Referring first to Fig. 1, there is illustrated an embodiment of a solenoid operated valve according to the invention. Reference numeral 1 designates a valve casing which has a cylindrical configuration and has a recess la opening in its inner end face. The valve casing 1 is further formed with an inlet port P at a radially inward location, a return port T having a larger diameter at a radially outward location, and an outlet port A radially intermediate between the two ports P, T, all axially extending and opening in the outer end face of the valve casing 1. These ports P, T and A are to be connected to an oil pump, an oil tank and an oil hydraulic actuator in an associated oil hydraulic circuit, none of which is shown. The recess la of the valve casing 1 has a generally inverted frustoconical shape, in which an annular inner piece 2 is fitted on an annular stepped shoulder la formed in the same recess via an O ring 4, and an annular outer piece 3 on another annular stepped shoulder la formed in the recess la via anO ring 5, respectively. The recess la cooperates with the inner and outer pieces 2, 3 to define therebetween a valve chamber 6 with which the inlet port P directly communicates, whereas the outlet port A and the return port T communicate with the valve chamber 6, respectively, by way of a communication passage 2a radially formed through the inner piece 2, and a communication passage 3a radially formed in one end face of the outer piece 3. Arranged within the valve chamber 6 are a ball valve 7 and a valve seat 8 on which the ball valve 7 is seated, the ball valve 7 and the valve seat 8 being urged toward the outer piece 3 by a compression spring 9 interposed between the valve seat 8 and the bottom surface of the recess la. More specifically, the valve seat 8 is disposed in a central hole 2b formed through the inner piece 2 and cooperate therewith to define an annular gap G communicating with the ports P, A. On the other hand, the outer piece 3 has a through hole 3b through which a coupling rod 14 extends, and the through hole 3b defines a further annular gapG between itself and the rod 14. The above stated elements 1 9 cooperatively form a main valving unit V. A fixed core 10 is disposed on an inner end face of the casing 1 of the main valving unit V and has a central protruded portion 10e fitted in an opening R defined between the recess la and an inner end face of the outer piece 3, with an O ring 11 interposed between the same protruded portion 10e and the casing 1. This core 10 is formed of a magnetic sintered metal, and has a radially extending annular flange 10b and a cylindrical barrel portion 10d having a smaller diameter than the central protruded portion and axially extending integrally from the flange 10b in a direction away from the main valving unit V.The fixed core 10 has an axially extending passage 10a formed through the barrel portion 10d and communicating with the communication passage 3a in the outer piece 3, as well as a central through hole 10c also formed through the barrel portion along its axis and through which the aforementioned coupling rod 14 axially movably extends. Fitted around the barrel portion 10d of the fixed core 10 is a tubular member 12 which is formed of a non magnetic material, and has an end portion located at a boundary between the flange 10b and the barrel portion 10d and brazed to the barrel portion 10d and the flange 10b along its whole periphery. Fitted around the tubular member 12 is a coil assembly 13 which is formed by a solenoid 13a and an annular coil support 13b on which the solenoid 13a is wound. A movable core 15 formed of a magnetic sintered metal is axially movably received within the tubular member 12. The movable core 15 has a passage 15a axially formed therethrough and disposed in alignment with the passage 10a in the fixed core 10 to cooperate therewith to allow feeding of hydraulic operating oil to a zone around the movable core 15. The movable core 15 has a recess 15b formed in its outer end face, in which is disposed a compression spring 16 having a smaller setting load than the aforementioned compression spring 9. An outer end portion of the tubular member 12 has its outer peripheral surface formed with an annular stepped shoulder 12a cooperating with an annular stepped shoulder 13b formed in an inner peripheral surface of a corresponding outer end portion of the coil support 13b to define therebetween an annular groove S.A covering member 18 in the form of a cap has an inner peripheral edge fitted in the annular groove S in contact with a washer 17 disposed in the same groove S, and encloses the movable core 15 in a manner that its bottom inner surface urges the movable core 15 against one end face of the coupling rod 14 via the above mentioned spring 16 interposed therebetween. The above peripheral edge of the covering member 18 has its inner peripheral surface formed with an annular stepped shoulder 18b and an O ring 19 is interposed between the same annular stepped shoulder and the opposed outer peripheral surface of the outer end portion of the tubular member 12. The covering member 18 further has an annular flange 18a radially extending integrally from its outer peripheral surface and formed with a through hole 18a through which a lead wire 13a of the solenoid 13 extends.This covering member 18 is formed of a magnetic metal and stamped from a plate of such metal. Another or peripheral covering member 20, which is in the form of a cap and is also formed of a stamped magnetic metal material, is disposed over the coil assembly 13 in a manner that its inner peripheral surface portion close to the bottom is disposed in contact with the outer peripheral surface of the flange 18a of the covering member 18, and its annular flange 20b formed at its peripheral edge is disposed in contact with the outer end face of the flange 10b of the fixed core 10. Further, the bottom wall 20a of the covering member 20 has a central opening 20a and a smaller through hole 20a formed therethrough, through which the covering member 18 and the above mentioned lead wire 13 a extend, respectively.This peripheral covering member 20 has its above flange 20b secured to the fixed core 10 as well as to the valve casing 1, by means of a plurality of bolts 21 only one of them is shown penetrated through the flange 10b of the core 10 and the valve casing 1. The manner of assembling the solenoid operated valve according to the invention constructed as above will now be described First, the spring 9 is placed into the recess la of the valve casing 1 of the main valving unit V, on which spring is placed the valve seat 8, followed by fitting the inner piece 2 into the same recess la at the inner stepped shoulder la with the O ring 4 interposed between the inner piece 2 and the inner stepped shoulder la . After this, the ball valve 7 is positioned into the central hole 2b of the inner piece 2, and then the outer piece 3 is fitted into the recess at the outer stepped shoulder la with the O ring 5 interposed between the outer piece 3 and the stepped shoulder la so as to have its communication passage 3a in alignment with the return port T.The main valving unit V is thus assembled. The central projected portion 10e of the fixed core 10 is inserted into the recess R with the O ring 11 interposed between the same projected portion 10e and the valve casing 1, so as to have the passage 10a in alignment with the communication passage 3a.Then, the coil assembly 13 is fitted around the outer peripheral surface of the tubular member 12 which is preferably joined to the barrel portion 10d of the fixed core 10 by brazing in advance. The coupling rod 14 is then fitted through the central hole 10c of the fixed core 10, and then the movable core 15 is inserted into the tubular member 12 with its passage 15a in alignment with the passage 10a of the fixed core 10, followed by placing the spring 16 into the recess 15b of the movable core 15. Then, the peripheral edge portion of the central covering member 18 is brought into the annular groove S, after the lead wire 13 a is fitted through the hole 18a of the covering member 18 and the washer 17 and the O ring 19 are placed into the groove S, so as to urgingly hold the O ring 19 in the same groove S.Thereafter, the peripheral covering member 20 is mounted so as to cover the central covering member 18 in a manner that the lead wire 13a is first fitted through the hole 20a of the peripheral covering member 20, and then the cylindrical portion of the covering member 18 is passed through the central hole 20a of the covering member 20, while the inner surface of the bottom wall 20a and the flange 20b are brought into contact with the flange 18a of the covering member 18 and the flange 10b of the fixed core 10, respectively. Then, the bolts 21 are screwed through the flange 20b of the peripheral covering member 20, the flange 10b of the fixed core 10 and the valve casing 1 to tightly fasten them together. The operation of the solenoid operated valve according to the invention is as follows When the solenoid 13a is in a deenergized state, the spring 9, which, as previously noted, has a setting load larger than the opposing spring 16 urging the movable core 15 inwardly, urgingly biases the valve seat 8, that is, the ball valve 7 into a position closing the gap G between the central hole 3b of the outer piece 3 and the coupling rod 14 to block the communication between the return port T and the valve chamber 6, while simultaneously opening the gap G between the central hole 2b of the inner piece 2 and the valve seat 8 to establish the communication between the inlet port P and the outlet port A through the communication passage 2a.On this occasion, hydraulic operating oil pumped by the oil pump is supplied to the oil hydraulic actuator through the mutually communicating ports P, A to drive the same actuator. Then, when the solenoid 13a is energized, a magnetic loop is formed, which extends through the same solenoid 13, the central covering member 18, the movable core 15, the fixed core 10, and the peripheral covering member 20 so that the resultant magnetic force attracts the movable core 15 to bring it into contact with the associated end face of the barrel portion 10d of the fixed core 10 against the force of the spring 9.Consequently, the ball valve 7 is urgedly displaced downwardly as viewed in Fig. 1, via the rod 14 to cause opening of the gapG , while simultaneously closing the gap G, thereby establishing the communication between the outlet port A and the return portT through the communication passage 2a, the gap G and the communication passage 3a as well as interrupting the communication between the ports A, T and the inlet port P.Accordingly, the operating oil supplied to the oil hydraulic actuator is returned to the oil tank by way of the mutually communicating ports A, T. Incidentally, the operating oil leaked to the space 15b in the movable core 15 through the gapG travels back through the passages 15a, 10a, the central hole 3b and the return port T, to be returned to the oil tank. Fig. 2 illustrates a solenoid operated valve according to a second embodiment of the invention. In Fig. 2, corresponding elements to those in Fig. 1 are designated by identical reference numerals. The solenoid operated valve of Fig. 2 is different from the valve of Fig. 1 in the sealing means sealing between the tubular member 12 and the fixed core 10. More specifically, the fixed core 10 has an annular stepped groove 10f formed therein at a boundary between one end face of the flange 10b facing toward the movable core 15 and the outer peripheral surface of the barrel portion 10d, whereas the inner end portion of the tubular member 12 has its outer peripheral surface formed with an annular stepped shoulder 12b.An O ring 22 and a washer 23 are fitted into the annular stepped groove 10f in the order mentioned, while the stepped inner end portion of the tubular member 12 is inserted into a gap defined between the O ring 22 and the barrel portion 10d, and then the coil support 13b is placed in place so as to have the stepped shoulder 12b of the tubular member 12 and the bottom surface of the coil support 13b urgingly hold the O ring 22 and the washer 23 in place. The other elements, not referred to above, of the solenoid operated valve of Fig. 2, as well as the operation thereof are the same as those of the preceding embodiment, decription of which is therefore omitted. As noted above, the present invention provides excellent results as follows 1 Since the valve is constructed such that the fixed core, the tubular member, the movable core, the springs, the coil assembly and the covering members are successively stacked one upon another on the main valving unit, and also the valve is generally simple in construction, the manufacture and assemblage are easy, thereby reducing the production cost 2 Since the fixed core and the movable core are made of a magnetic sintered metal, desired size tolerances are available without requiring any machining operation, thereby also reducing the production cost as well as reducing the weight 3 Since the covering members are made of a stamped magnetic metal, the production cost can be further reduced and 4 The provision of sealing means comprised of an annular sealing member between the covering means and the tubular member, and sealing means comprised of brazing means or an annular sealing member between the tubular member and the fixed core, can achieve high liquidtightness at the junctions, thereby avoiding leakage of hydraulic operating oil to the outside. While preferred embodiments of the invention have been described, variations thereto will occur to those skilled in the art within the scope of the present inventive concepts which are delineated by the following claims.
