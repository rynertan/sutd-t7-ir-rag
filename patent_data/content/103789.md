# Method for defining graphic patterns for a numerical control apparatus.

## Abstract
A system for defining graphic patterns for an NC apparatus includes a display 102 a display control 103 for controlling the display to display, as head items, addres ses comprising the designation of a straight line or an arc for a planar graphic pattern, the coordinates of an ending point of the graphic pattern, a vector angle of the straight line or a radius of the arc, vector components of the straight line or coordinates of the center of the arc, and modifiers data setting means 104 for setting known data by successively or appropriately using addresses displayed on the display means and indicative of the straight line and the arc derived from the planar graphic pattern a memory 106 for storing the addresses, the data set by the data setting means, and formulas computing means 107 for computing the set data stored in the memory 106 according to the formulas to determine the addresses of unknown data which have not been given numerical values by the data setting means central processing means 105 for controlling the computing means and the memory to store the results of computation effected by the computing means and output control means responsive to the set data and computed data stored in the memory for controlling the movement of a machine tool.
