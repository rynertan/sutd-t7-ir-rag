# Measurement method, and apparatus therefor.

## Abstract
A method of measuring a coordinate value of a prescribed point on an object, and an apparatus for practicing said meth od, includes a step of generating a signal when a measuring element contacts the object at the prescribed point. In re sponse to the signal, a pulse distribution operation based on a commanded amount of movement is suspended, the differ ence between a commanded position and a positional devia tion is computed by arithmetic means, said deviation being the difference between a number of commanded pulses and a number of feedback pulses, and the positional deviation is cleared from the contents of an error counter, thereby to stop the measuring element. The difference computed by the arith metic means is the coordinate value of the prescribed point on the object.
