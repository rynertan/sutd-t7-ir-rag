# Apparatus for controlling operation of an industrial robot.

## Abstract
An apparatus for controlling operation of an industrial robot having a drive source for moving an arm to a preset position to effect operation under the control of a program. The position of the arm is detected and an output in the form of an electric signal is generated by a detector. A memory stores a position signal corresponding to a prescribed position ahead of the preset position. A comparator com pares signals from the electronic detection signal and the memory and issues a position completion signal irrespective of arm movement when the arm reaches the prescribed position. The detector, memory and comparator are added in parallel to an arm driver unit, whereby the program can proceed while the arm is being moved.
