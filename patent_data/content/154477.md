# Apparatus for inserting pouring spouts into containers.

## Abstract
A machine for inserting pouring spouts 270 in container tops or caps 230 feeds the tops to an indexing work table 80 through an inlet apparatus which coordinates the position of the tops with the position of the indexing table. Mounting apparatus 200 is provided to mount the tops 230 on the indexing work table, which table moves the tops in a coordinated sequence to work positions where the pouring spouts are inserted in the tops. The indexing work table 80 then moves the tops to an outlet position where ejecting apparatus 202 removes the tops with the inserted spouts from the indexing work table, the pouring spouts on the tops are placed in the desired position and the tops are properly oriented as the tops leave the spout inserting machine. A pneumatic assembly Figure 2 provides for the delivery of the container tops to the indexing table 80 and for transfer of the container tops with the inserted spouts away from the indexing table. The indexing table 80 is coordinated with the mounting apparatus 200, ejecting apparatus 202 and the inserting apparatus by a power transmission system Figure 4 powered by an indexing drive.
