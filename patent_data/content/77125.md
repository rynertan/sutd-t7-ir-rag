# Hydraulic pressure relief valve for lock up clutch.

## Abstract
A pressure relief valve 75 to control the opening of a port between two pressure vessels at a prede termined time to eliminate differential pressure between the vessels. More particularly, the lock up clutch as sembly 11 in a torque converter is actuated due to a pressure differential on the opposite sides of the clutch or piston plate, and the pressure relief valve will open upon deceleration of the vehicle driven by the torque converter to equalize the pressure on the opposite sides of the clutch plate and allow disengagement of the clutch plate from the torque converter housing 13 .
