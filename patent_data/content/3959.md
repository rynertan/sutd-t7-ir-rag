# Collapse resistant corrugated filter element.

## Abstract
A corrugated tubular filter element 1 is provided, resistant to corrugation collapse under high differential pressure, although formed of filter sheet material susceptible to such collapse, comprising, in combination, filter sheet material 2 enclosed in a dual layer of more open foraminous sheet material and formed in a closed corrugated configuration having axial corrugation folds arranged in groups 4 with adjacent side surfaces in supporting contact with each other and, interposed between said groups, solid wedge support elements 10 extending axially of the corrugation folds from end to end of the element having side surfaces in supporting contact with external side surfaces of the end folds of each group, substantially filling the spaces between the end folds of adjacent groups, and confining the folds of each group in substantially parallel array against lateral movement and a foraminous support sheath 15, 16 disposed at least one of externally and internally of the filter sheet material in supporting contact with adjacent fold ends and retaining the wedge support elements and folds against one of outward and inward movement.
