# Axial flow fan imparting both radial and axial flow components to the airflow.

## Abstract
A cross flow fan 10 imparts both radial and axial flow components to airflow passing through the fan, resulting in a conical exit airflow. The fan includes a hub 12 and circumferentially spaced, radially extending fan blades 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, and 24 . Backing plate portion 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, and 44 is associated with each of the blades 14 24 . The backing plate portions lie on a conical plane which rakes backwardly from the hub in a direction downstream from the fan. The fan blades 14 24 are disposed in a plane oblique to their corresponding backing plate portions, so that they intersect the latter along adjoining edge 50 . Each of the fan blades 14 24 includes portions having greater 56 and lesser 58 radii of curvature. The portions 58 of lesser radii of curvature cooperate with the corresponding backing plate portions 36 to provide a radial component to the flow through the fan whereas the leading edge portions 56 provide the axial flow component.
