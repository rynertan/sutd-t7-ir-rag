# Photographic materials and process comprising polymeric couplers.

## Abstract
A polymeric coupler which is at least a copolymer having a repeating unit A which comprises at least one coupler moiety COUP capable of forming a dye upon coupling with an oxidized color developing agent and at least one repeating unit B which is derived from a monomer which is an alkoxyalkyl acrylate is useful in dye forming photographic elements and processes. The polymeric coupler optionally comprises at least one repeating unit C derived from such monomers as those useful for repeating unit A , those useful for repeating unit B and other monomers which can be selected to provide useful physical and chemical properties. The photographic ma terial comprising such a polymeric coupler upon exposure and processing enables formation of a dye image having increased dye density.
