## Description
NATURE OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to the formation of thiona r.ide compounds by the reaction of sulfur with imine compounds. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThionamide compounds of the general structure EMI2.1 are not readily available industrially and are considered almost a rare chemical. Thionamide compounds are reported, however, to have potential uses in a variety of areas such as mining floatation additives, vulcanization, polynerization catalysts, electro plating, polynner stabilization, fiber fixatives, and as seed germinating agents. Thionamides are also suitable as chemical intermediates in the manufacture of other chemicals. I have now discovered a new and improved process for making thionamides by the reaction of free sulfur with imine compounds. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Briefly stated, this invention comprises a process for preparing thionamide compounds by reacting an imine having the following structural formula EMI3.1 where R is an alkyl group preferably of 1 to 8 carbon atoms, and is other than a cyclohexyl or phenyl group, R1 and R9 are each phenyl groups or alkyl groups of 1 to 18 carbon atoms, and R3 is a phenyl group of 1 to 18 carbon atoms or is a hydrogen atom, with free sulfur in the presence of an immiscible alcohol compound. Preferably R1 and R2 are 1 to 6 carbon atoms each.The total number of carbons in R, R1, R2, and R3 does not exceed 36 in number. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION As stated above, the process in general of this invention constitutes the preparation of a thionamide compound by reacting an imine having the structural formula EMI3.2 where R is an alkyl group, other than a cyclohexyl group, of 1 to 18 carbon atoms, R1 and R2 are phenyl groups or alkyl groups of 1 to 6 or 1 to 18 carbon atoms, and R3 is hydrogen or a phenyl group, with elemental sulfur in the presence of a triol or diol. Preferred imine compounds are those having the corresponding structural formulas 2 ethylbutylidene isopropyl amine EMI4.1 2 ethylbutylidene 2 ethylhexyl amineEMI4.2 2 ethylhexylidene 2 ethylhexyl amineEMI5.1 isobutylidene 2 ethylhexyl amineEMI5.2 The sulfur utilized in the process can be in any form and preferably is in particulate form for ease in mixing. The third and necessary component of the reaction mixture is a diol or triol compound and preferably is selected from the group consisting of glycerol, ethylene glycol, 1,2 propane diol and triethanol amine. Any polyol or mono ol can be used as long as it has sufficient polarity to make the alcohol phase and organic phase immiscible under the reaction conditions used.The sulfur is added to the reaction mixture preferably in a stoichiometric ratio of 1 gram atom of sulfur to 1 mole of the imine compound. The amount of diol or triol material included in the reaction mixture is between about 1 and 30tic by weight per part of total reaction mixture. Greater amounts could be used but are not economical. The reactants are mixed at room temperature preferably and then heated to a temperature of approximately 265OF 13O0C where the reaction becomes exothermic. The reaction is allowed to continue at an elevated temperature.The actual temperature of reaction is not critical other than it should not be allowed to rise to a point where decomposition of the reactants or reaction product begins to occur. Ordinarily the temperature will not exceed 400OF. The reaction is conducted at atmospheric or near atmospheric pressure. When the reaction is completed, the reaction mixture is allowed to cool to reduce the temperature. It is then desirable to refine the thionamide product obtained by removing water and glycerin and any unreacted components. One convenient method of purification constitutes first quenching the reaction mass in cold water and extracting the product in an organic solvent such as diethyl ether or pentane. After agitation the mixture is allowed to separate into two phases, an organic phase and an aqueous phase. The organic phase will contain the desired thionamide product. The thionamide product in the organic phase can then be decanted and the pentane or ether solvent removed by distillation. The resultant product ordinarily will be of a reddish amber appearance and is then ready for use for any of the uses outlined above. Example 1 Isopropyl amine in the amount of 118 grams 2.0 gram moles was slowly mixed at 10 0C in a reaction flask with 200 grams 2 gram moles of 2 ethylbutyraldehyde over a 10 minute period. The reaction mixture was allowed to separate into an aqueous phase and an organic phase, The aqueous phase 33 grams was discarded and the organic phase was dried by passing it through filter paper. Approximately 266 grams of organic product considered to be 2 ethylbutenylidene isopropyl amine was obtained. One hundred and twelve 112 grams 0.8 mole of this material was then mixed with 100 grams of glycerol and heated with stirring to 90 C. Powdered sulfur in the amount of 30 grams 0.94 grnm atoms was then added to the mixture and heated further.At approximately l20 C the sulfur melted into the glycerine phase and at 140 to 160 C the evolution of heat was observed. The mixture was allowed to react for 30 minutes after which the mixture was cooled, quenched by the addition of 500 ml of ice water and extracted twice with 20 milliliters ether portions. The two 250 milliliter ether portions were combined, and passed through filter paper to be dried. The ether was then boiled away and the residue subjected to vacuum distillation at approximately 600C to produce 107 grams of an orange solid, deemed to be the desired product N isopropyl 2 ethylbutylthionamide .The product obtained when analyzed for sulfur showed 19 sulfur, which corresponds to 18.5 in the theoretical structure. NMR analysis showed the material to have the composition of N isopropyl 2 ethylbutylthionamide. Example II The procedure of Example I was followed except that glycerine was omitted in the second reaction. There was no evidence of the evolution of heat and the resultant product was a mixture of black products and water soluble white crystalline material which was not the desired product. Example III Under the conditions described in the first reaction ofExample I the compound, 2 ethylbutylidene 2 ethylhexyl amine, was prepared by reacting 258 grams approximately 2.0 gram moles of 2 ethylhexyl amine and 200 grams 2.0 grammoles of 2 ethylbutyraldehyde. Approximately 404 grams of 2 ethylbutylidene 2 ethylhexyl amine were obtained. NMR analysis indicated the product obtained conformed to the structure for 2 ethylbutylidene 2 ethylhexyl amine. Three hundred and sixty 360 grams 1.7 gram moles of the product obtained was added to 50 grams of glycerol in a stirred flask and heated to 1000C. Sulfur powder 64 grams 2.0 gram atoms was added and the material heated further.At approximately l300C the sulfur melted into the glycerIne phase and some evolution of heat was noted at 140 to 1500C. The final reaction temperature was 1900C. After a thirty minute reaction period, the reaction mixture was twice extracted with pentane 500 ml each . The first pentane fraction was distilled at atmospheric pressure and the second pentane fraction distilled under vacuum. During the distillation the pentane was removed first and then the thionamide product, at a higher temperature. The first cut resulted in a yield of 181 grams and the second in a cut of 134 grams. The sulfur content of the first cut product was 16.3 and that of the second 16.6 to be compared with a theoretical sulfur content of 16.3 . Example IV The thionamide products obtained in Examples I and III were tested as wear additives in a concentration of 170 by weight in a 100 N lube oil stock using the Falex test procedure described in ASTM D 3233 73.Results were as follows Falex ResultsControl 100 Valube Neutral One minute step ups OK at 300 libs. jaw load, 7 lbs. torque failed at 500 lbs. jaw load, 11 lbs. torque.Product from Example I OR at 500 lbs. jaw load, 12 lbs. torque failed on step up to 750 lbs. jaw load.Product from Example III OK at 500 Ibs. jaw load, 12 Ibs. torque failed at 750 lbs. jaw load 19 lbs. torque.These results were deemed acceptable.

These tests indicate the utility of the compounds of the invention in improving wear and extreme pressure features of lubricants. The side effects of corrosion are substantially reduced. It has been determined that the presence of a polar solvent is not necessary if the imine compound has incorporated within it sufficient polarity. Specifically imine compounds meeting this requirement have the structural formula EMI14.1 where the total of the atomic weights of R, Rl, R2, and R3 is less than 300. The imine compound must further contain at least one of the following groups hydroxy, mercapto, ether, thioether, amid, thionamido, sulfoxy, sultonyl, tertiary amine, secondary amine or pyridyl amine. Imine compounds and their corresponding structural forniulas meeting this requirement are 2 ethylhexylidene 2,2 dimethyl 3 dimethylaminopropyl amine A EMI15.1 2 isobutylidene 2 methoxyethyl amine B EMI15.2 2 ethylhexylidene 2 N piperidino ethyl amine C EMI15.3 3 pyridyl methylidene isopropyl amine D EMI16.1 2 ethylhexylidene 1,1 dimethylolpropyl amine E EMI16.2 Example IV Each of the above amine derivatives A, B, C, D, and E was prepared in the laboratory. The prepared derivatives were then reacted with elemental sulfur on a basis of one gram mole of derivative per gram atom of sulfur. Reaction began when a mixture of a reactant was heated to about l100C. Reaction continued while the tempers ature rose to 1400C. After reaction was deemed complete, the mixture was cooled and extracted with ether. The ether fraction was then distilled to remove the ether. The residue was the desired end product.
