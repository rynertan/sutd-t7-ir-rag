# Compressor drive system.

## Abstract
A compressor drive system for controlling the gas pressure in a pressure gas volume 106 connected to the compressor 101 . A brushless alternating current motor 23 is directly coupled to the compressor, which is driven with the same speed as the motor. The pressure in the gas volume 106 is sensed by pressure sensing means 109 connected to a converter 114 . The converter simultaneous ly changes the amplitude and frequency of the drive voltage supplied to the motor 23 . This is done in response to pressure changes in volume 106 . The motor is stopped if the pressure exceeds a preset maximum value. A pressure gas container 104 is depressurized at motor stop to allow restarting without counter pressure on the compressor. Means 44 for controlling the amplitude and frequency of the drive voltage is provided so that the normal speed maximum load current is never exceeded during motor start.
