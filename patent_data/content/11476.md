# Production of methane by hydrogenolysis of hydrocarbons a process for the production of a supported ruthenium catalyst a catalyst comprising ruthenium.

## Abstract
Supported ruthenium metal catalysts prepared by reduction of carbonyl compounds give improved yields of methane in the hydro cracking of hydrocarbons, especially alkanes and alkyl aromatics. Alkanes may be cracked to methane at low temperatures 200 300 C and the de alkylation of alkyl benzenes may be controlled sufficiently to allow removal of isomers e.g. ethylbenzene from xylenes. The novel catalysts comprise ruthenium clusters having average dimensions below 20 Ã….
