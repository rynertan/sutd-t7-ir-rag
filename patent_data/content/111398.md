# Alkali metal silicate binder compositions.

## Abstract
A binder composition in aqueous solution, suitable for use in the production of foundry sand moulds and cores is otained by mixing an alkali metal silicate, glycosylated polyhydric alcohols produced by acid catalysed condensa tion of a carbohydrate having a reducing group and an alcohol having two or more hydroxyl groups, and optionally an oxyanion salt such as a borate.
