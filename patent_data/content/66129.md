# Method for producing L threonine by fermentation.

## Abstract
New L threonine producing strains of the genus Brevibacterium and Corynebacterium are obtained by separating a plasmid DNA from a microorganism of the genus Brevibacterium and Corynebacterium, inserting into the plasmid DNA a fragment of chromosomai DNA derived from a DNA donor strain of the genus Brevibacterium or Corynebacterium resistant to alpha amino beta hydroxy valeric acid to obtain a recombinant plasmid DNA, incorporating the recombinant plasmid DNA into a recipient strain of the genus Brevibacterium or Corynebacterium which is sensitive to alpha amino beta hydroxy valeric acid and isolating a strain transformed to become resistant to alpha amino beta hydroxy valeric acid. By aerobically cultivating the new strains in an aqueous culture medium L threonine may be obtained in high yields.
