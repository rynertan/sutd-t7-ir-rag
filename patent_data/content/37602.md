# Photographic elements containing novel cyan forming colour couplers.

## Abstract
Cyan forming phenol type colour couplers comprising in the 2 position of the phenol a benzamido group carrying on the benzene nucleus of the benzamido group at least one Q Rf group wherein Q is O , S , or SOâ‚‚ and Rf is a short chain fluorine containing group derived from hexafluoro propylene or trifluorochloroethylene. These cyan forming colour couplers can be incorporated in a red sensitized silver halide emulsion layer s of a photo graphic multilayer colour element or in a non light sensitive colloid layer in water permeable relationship with the red sensitized emulsion layer s .
