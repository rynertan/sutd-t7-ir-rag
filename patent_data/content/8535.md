## Description
A Gate Controlled Semiconductor device Thc prescnt invention relates to a semiconductor device, and more particularly to an improved gate structure for 2 gate controlled semiconductor device. A gate control semiconductor device such as, for exm.ple, a gate turn off thyristor is constructed similarly to the more usual reverse blocking three terminal thyristor. The gate turn off thyristor is switched rrotr a non conductive state to a conductive state by supplying a current to a gate electrode thereof, when main current flows into the gate turn off thyristor.The gate turn off thyristor is returned to the nonconductive state from the conductive state by supplying a negative current, which is the current flowing in the reverse direction for reverse biasing the cathode junction. The configuration of the cathode electrode is important to the turn off performance of the device. When a gate turn off thyristor is turned off by supplying a reverse biasing signal the reduction of the main current of the gate turn off thyristor starts in the vicinity of the gate electrode, and spreads to the central portion and finally reaches the cathode en itter layer.Various configurations of the cathode and the gate are used or proposed in order to enhance current interrupting capa bility. One method makes the traverse resistance of the base layer small. In view of the above, the gate turn off thyristor is designed so that the cathode electrode is located as near the gate electrode as possible, in order to eliminate the inner impedance between the cathode and the gate electrode. Acròrdingly, the cathode electrode is divided into many small pieces and, as a result, the length of the opposing faces of the cathode electrode and the gate electrode become inevitably long and, in particular, the cathode junction of a large capacity gate turn off thyristor is divided into a large number of small pieces. Figures 1 and 2 show an exampla of the conventional gate controlled semiconductor device in the form of a gate turn off thyristor. In Figures 1 and 2, the reference numeral 1 shows a semiconductor element. The semiconductor element 1 comprises a P1 layer 2 which is aP type region, an N1 layer bulk 3, P2 layer 4 which is aP type region and a plurality of N2 layers which are Ntype regions. The reference numeral 6 is a cavity provided on the centre portion of a surface of the P2 layer 4. A plurality of involute shaped slots 7 are provided on the surface of the P2 layer 4 so as to communicate with the cavity 6. The slots 6 are spaced apart equidistantallyA metallic layer 8 is arranged in a bottom portion of the cavity 6, and the metallic layer 8 consists of a bridging segment 8a and a plurality of involute shaped e .tensions Bb extending respectively along to the slot 7 from the bridging segment 8a toward the periphery of the semicoductor element 1. A lead 9 is connected to the bridging segment 8a of the metallic layer 8 to form a gate electrode assembly G.A plurality of involute shaped metallic layers 10 are provided, respectively, on each N2 layer 5. A circular shaped metallic layer 11 having a bore Ila is secured on the metallic layers 10 to form a bridging member. K is the cathode electrode assembly. In the cathode electrode assembly K, the gap between adjacent emitter regions is the same over the entire assembly. Figures 3 and 4 show another example of a gate turn off thyristor. In the gate turn off thyristor shown in Figures 3 and a low resistance layer 15 is embedded in the P2 layer 4. The low resistance layer 15 is formed by diffusing a high concentration P type impurity into the P2 layer 4. The low resistance layer 15 consists of a circular shaped bridging portion 15a provided in the cre portion of the P2 layer 4 and a plurality of involuteshaped extensions 15b extending radially and spirally fron the bridling portion 15a toward the periphery of the con ductile element 1. The distance D between adjacent extensions 15b is equal throughout, as in the case of the device of Figures 1 and 2.A metallic layer 8 is provided so as to contact the bridging portion 15a of the low resistance layer 15 to form a gate electrode assembly G.A plurality of involute shaped N2 layers 5 are provided on the P2 layer 4. A ring shaped N2 layer 5 is provided on the surface of the P2 layer 4, and a ring shaped metallic layer 11 is secured on the N2 layer 5 to form a cathode electrode assembly K. Accordingly, the device of Figures 3 and 4 is, substantially, an involute type gate turn off thyristor similar to that of Figures 1 and 2. In the device of Figures 3 and 4, the effective area of the element 1 is enhanced because of the P layer 5 embedded in the P2 layer 4. However, the strength against a reversing voltage between the gate electrode assembly G and the cathode electrode assembly K is superior to that of the device of Figures 1 and 2, because the P layer 5 is provided in the P2 layer 4. In the devices shown in Figures 1 and 2 and inFigures 3 and 4, when the element 1 is conductive, a main current flows from the anode electrode assembly A to the cathode electrode assembly K by way of the P1N1P2N2 layers.In turning OFF the semiconductor element 1, an OFF signal is supplied to the gate electrode assembly G from the external gate lead 9, and thereby the conductive element 1 is swept of the main current by means of the gate electrode assembly G. When turning OFF the main current, the current flows toward the external gate electrode 9 from the cathode electrode assembly I so as to apply the reverse bias to the junction formed by the P2 layer 4 and N2 layer 5. In this case, the current flows from the cathode assembly K to the gate electrode assembly G, and thereby the portion of theN2 layer 5 opposite to the gate electrode assembly G is turned OF. Thereafter, each cathode portion opposite to the gate electrode is, in turn, returned to an OFF state. hen the N2 layer 3 which forms the cathode electrode assembly K is swept of main current by the OFF signal supplied from the gate electrode assembly G, the main current which flows in the cathode region may be turned OFF quickly if a resistance component does not exist in the gate electrode assembly G, as illustrated in Figures 5A to SC. Figures SA to 5C show the variation of conductive areas in a cathode area when the main current anode current IA is turned OFF.In more detail, the main current of the semiconductor element 1 is assumed to be interrupted during the time interval T t0 to tng as is shown by a curve 1 in Figure SA. Ey applying the reversebias signal to the cathode emitter layer, the conductive element 1 is turned off during time interval to to tn. As is shown in Figure 5C, if the transverse resistance valueR and the resistance value r g of the gate electrode assembly G are zero, respectively, the turn OFF zones of the main current at various times may be distributed as is shown by dotted lines in Figures SA and 5C and, as a result, the main current 1A which flows in the radial and centre portions between the pair of extensions 8b and 8b is finally turned off, as is shown hypothetically by dotted lines of Figures 5A and 5C. In the actual gate turn off thyristor, there is some transverse resistance and gate resistance, and some reverse bias voltage is dropped due to the impedance of the gate electrode assembly G, the transverse resistance and the gate current Ig. The voltage drop of the reverse bias voltage becomes higher as the distance from the terminal of the gate electrode assembly G becomes longer.The turning off regions are distributed as is shown by dotted lines of Figure SD. The turn CFF time of the main current IX in the cathode electrode assembly Is increases as the distance between the terminal of the gate electrode and any portion of cathode electrode increases. Consquently, the main current 1A is finally concentrated to a point B which is localized at the radial and extreme end portion of the centre line of the cathode area. In the devices described above, the area occupied by the main current in the cathode electrode assembly K becomes progressively smaller and, therefore, the main current IA is finally turned off when the gate i pedance is highest, because the gate current 1g flows through the longest current path. It is, accordingly, impossible to manufacture a large current capacity gate controlled semiconductive device, since the current interrupting capabil ity is restricted by the length of the gate current path.It is important that the internal impedance of the gate electrode as well as the transverse resistance of the cathode layer be lowered. Accordingly, an object of the invention is to provide a high performance gate controlled semiconductor device in which the turn off of the main current is improved. According to the present invention a gate controlled semiconductor device comprises a semiconductor element wafer of semiconductor material having four layers of alternate conductivity types defining three series arranged junctions, said semiconductor element comprises an anode electrode assembly, a cathode electrode assembly, a gate electrode assembly surrounding said cathode electrode assembly, and means for changing the turn off timing of the main current of said semiconductor element.

With reference to Figures 6 and 7 of the drawings, in a gate controlled semiconductor device, a semiconductor element 1, the bulk of which is weakly N type, includes aP1 layer 2 which is a P type diffused region, an N1 bulk layer 3, a P2 layer 4 which is a P type diffused region and a ring shaped N2 layer 5 which is an N type diffused region. A device of the kind described above is made essentially as follows. First, a weakly N type silicon wafer is prepared.Nest P1 and P2 layers are grown over each of the end surfaces of the wafer by the diffusion of gallium. After that a cathode layer N2 is formed by diffusing N type layer to a given depth. Then, an aluminium layer is evaporated to form an ohmic contact. A metallic layer 8 is provided on a centre portion of the surface of the P2 layer 4, and a lead 9 is connected to the metallic layer 8. A first gate clectrode assembly G1 comprises the P2 layer 4, the metallic layer 8 and the lead 9. As is best shom in Figures 6 and 7, a low resis tance layer 15 is embedded in the P2 layer 4. The low resistance layer 15 consists of a circular shaped Thridcjng portion 15a localized in the outer portion of the N layer 4 and a plurality of extending portions 15h extending radially from the bridging portion la, toward the centre portion of the P2 layer 4. s is illustrated in vicurc 6, each of the efirtending portions 15b of the low resistance layer 15 is sector shaped so that the width of each extending portion 15b becomes gradually smaller at the end.Accordingly, the width d1 of the end portion of the effec tive emitter layer 19 is smaller than the width d2 of the base portion. A circular slot 16 is provided on the surface of the P2 layer 4 located at the outer side of the 22 layer 4 by etching the surface of the P2 layer 4 up to the upper surface of the bridging portion 15a of the low resistance layer 15. A circular shaped metallic layer 17 is arranged in the slot 16 so as to contact the bridging portion 15 of the high density P impurity layer 15. The metallic layer 17 is made by evaporating aluminium. Terminal leads 18 are connected to the metallic layer 16. The leads 18 are relatively big zluminizm wires which have low impedance. Accordingly, a second gate electrode assembly G2 comprises the low resistance layer 15 consisting of the high impurity P layer and consisting of the bridging portion 15a and the plurality of sector shaped extending portions 15b. A cathode electrode assembly i is formed by theN2 layer 5 and the metallic layer 11. As is shown inFigure 6, the N2 layer 5 is a main emitter layer, and a plurality of sector portions 5a of the N2 layer 5 form an effective emitter layer when the conductive element 1 is activated. It is important that each of the extensions 15b is formed of a radial sector in which the width of the end portion is narrower than that of the base portion connected to the bridging portion 15a of the low resistance layer 15, and that the cathode layer is substantially divided into many pieces. In operation, an ON signal is supplied from the first gate electrode assembly G1 and, an OFF signal is supplied from the second gate electrode assembly G2.During turn off current in the element 1 is swept from the element by the second electrode assembly G2. When the ON signal is supplied between the cathode electrode assembly 1 and the first gate electrode assembly G1, the gate current flows in a circuit which is formed by the first gate electrode assembly G1, the P2 layer 4, the N1 layer 3, the N2 layer 5 cathode layer and the second gate electrode assembly G2.The gate current causes a portion of the N2 layer 5 on the side of second gate electrode assembly G2 to turn on, and thereafter the main current begins to flow from the anode electrode assembly A to the cathode electrode assembly K. During flow of the main current, the conductive region of the N2 layer 5 spreads throughout the region of the N2 layer 5 from the second gate electrode assembly side of the N2 layer 5. When turning off of the main current occurs, gate turn off current flows toward the cathode electrode assembly IX from the leads 18 of the second gate electrode assembly G2 so as to apply reverse bias to the junctions formed by the P2 layer 4 and the N2 layer 5 by way of a circuit formed by the circular shaped metallic layer 17, the bridging portion 15a of the low resistance layer the P impurity layer 15 , each of the extensions 15b of theP impurity layer 15 and the P2 layer 4, and thereby each portion opposite to the second gate electrode assembly G2 is, in turn, returned to the off state. In turn off of the device, the main current is simultaneously interrupted in the whole surface of the cathode layer, because the resistance values are made equal in all gate current paths by constructing the effective emitter layer 19 of the semiconductor element 1 so that thn width of the end portion in the extending portion 15b becomes smaller than that of the base portion thereof. In the effective emitter layer 19, the width d1 in the far portion from the metallic layer 17 is smaller than thc nearest portion thereto.The ratio of the widths d1 and d2 of the effective emitter layer is determined by the resistance value in the radial direction of the lad resistance layer 15 and the transverse resistance value of the P type base layer. In comparing gate controlled semiconductor devices shown in Figures 1 to 4 and the gate controlled semiconductor device of Figures 6 and 7, a Pun 2 layer was manufactured by selectively diffusing gallium to an N type silicon bulk, and thereafter Boron was partially diffused on one surface of the NPN layer so that the sheet resistance became 0.851 mm2. Thereafter, an N type silicon layer was formed on the Boron diffused surface by the epitzatian method so that the bulk resistance became 15 Q m. The ring shaped cathode layer was formed on the surface of theN type silicon layer and phosphorous was selectivel diffused into the silicon layer. For the gate controlled semiconductor devices constructed above, the gate current value required was to be 0.2 to 0.5 amperes and the forward voltage drop was to be 2.5 to 3.0 volts. Further the voltage rating was to be 850 to 1400 volts. The same performance was obtained in the prior art device and the device of the present invention for the gating current characteristic, the forward voltage drop and the voltagc rating. In the prior art gate controlled semiconductor device, the turning off time interval was 3.0 ps and the rated current was 150 to 200 amperes. In the gate controlled semiconductor device of the present invention, the turn oLf time interval was 1.5 S s and the rated current was 200 to 400 amperes.As is obvious from the above data, the gate controlled semiconductor device of the present invention is superior to that of the prior art gate controlled semiconductor devices in respect of the current capacity and the turn off characteristic. Figures 8 and 9 illustrate a gate turr cfL thyristor which also employs in the invention. In the gate turn off thyristor shown in Figures 8 and 9, a disc shaped low resistance layer 20 is embedded in the P2 layer a, and a plurality of ring shaped low resistance layers 21a, 21b and 21c are provided concentrically with the low resistance layer 20. A plurality of involute shaped low resistance layers 22a are provided in the P2 layer 4. Each of the low resistance layers 20, 21a to 22c is, respectively, formed by diffusing the high impurity P type material. The layers 22a extend from the layer 20 toward the ring shaped low resistance layer 21a and are connected to the layer 21a.The low resistance layers 22a are also spaced apart eefui distantly. A plurality of involute shaped low resistance layers 22b are provided in the P2 layer 4, and are connected between the ring shaped low resistance layers 21a and 21b. A plurality of involute shaped low resistance layers 22a are provided in the P2 layer 4 and are also connected to the resistance layers 21b and 21c. A cavity 6 is provided on the surface of the P2 layer 4, located to the centre portion of the P2 layer 4 by etching the surface of the P2 layer 4 up to the upper surface of the low resistance layer 20. A disc shaped metallic layer 8 is provided on the low resistance layer 20 by evaporating aluminium. A first gate electrode assembly G1 comprises the lo i resistance layer 20, the metallic layer 8 and a lead 9 connected to the metallic layer 20. 7 circular shaped slot 16 is provided on the surface of the P2 layer 4 located on the outer side of the P2 layer 4 by etching of the surface of the P2 layer 4 up to the upper surface of the outermost low resistance layer 22c.A ring shaped metallic layer 17 is also provided on the layer 21c, and a plurality of leads 18 are connected to the metallic layer 17. A second gate electrode assembly G2 comprises the low resistance layer 20 as a bridging portion, the low resistance layers 22c, the low resistance layers 22b, the metallic layer 17 and the lea 18. In the gate controlled semiconductor device, there are effective N type emitter layers 23a, 23b and 23c. The width d2 of the effective cathode emitter layer 23b is designed so as to be smaller than the width d1 of the effective cathode emitter layer 23a and the width d Gf the effective cathode emitter layer 23c. As is shown inFigure 8, each of the widths of the layers 21a, 21b and 21c is, respectively, do and the radius of each of the layers 21a, 21b and 21c is, respectively, rl, r2 and r3.Accordingly, the transverse resistance of the lower region of the effective cathode emitter 2 3b is .smaller than that of the lower regions of the effective cathode emitter layers 23a and 23c. Under these conditions, the effective cathode emitter layer 23b is first turned OFF, and thereafter the effective cathode emitter layers 23a and 23c are turned OFF by applying the reverse biasing signal to the cathode electrode assembly K from the first gate electrode assembly G1 and the second gate electrode assembly G2. The distance between the metallic layer 17 and the region in which the main current is finally turnedOFF becomes short and thereby the current interrupting capability is enhanced. Although three series connected gate electrode IxEnibers are formed in the above embodiment, two or more series connected gate electrode member would give the same performance. Figures 10 and 11 show a further embodiment of the invention. The device has an involute shaped gate electrode assembly G1. A plurality of small shortcircuiting holes 24 are provided in the P1 layer 2, an projecting portions 25 of the N1 layer 3 are situated in the holes 24 to form shorting segments. In more detail, an anode emitter junction J1 is partially short circuited between the P1 layer 2 and the M1 layer 3 by the short circuiting projections of the N2 layer 3.The short circuiting projections 25 are arranged on a plurality of circular lines so that the nur..ber of projections 25 increases in the outer side of the P1 layer 2. The short circuit projections 25 are arranged concentrically on the P1 layer 2 so that the concentrations second higher in the outer side portion of the 1 layer 2 than that in the central portion. In turning of the device as constructed above, the current amplification factor is low in the outer side portion of the conductive element 1 and is high in the centre portion which is the nearest portion to the gate electrode assembly G1. The turnirg off operation starts at the portion furthest from the gate electrode assembly G1, and the central portion of the element I is turned of last.Accordingly, the current interrupting capability o the device is.Increased since the element 1 can be turned of by driving the gate from a low impedance source. In the device of Figures 10 and 11, many projections 25 are arranged in the periphery of the P2 layer 2, and few projections 25 are provided in the central portion. The short circuiting resistance at the periphery of the conductive element 1 is lower than that of the central portion which is the nearest portion to the gate electrode assembly G1, and the impedance between the gate electrode assembly G1 and all regions of the semiconductor element is relatively constant. Because of the constant impedance from the gate electrode to all regions of the conductive element 1, the turn off time interval is shortened since the main current is interrupted simultaneously in all regions of the semiconductor element 1. With the devices as constructed above, the turnoff time interval is shortened by SO to 70r , in cor,lDarison with prior art gate controlled semiconductor devices. In addition, the current interrupting capability the device as constructed above is much better. Another gate controlled Eemiconductor device mav be considered as a modification of the gate turn off thyristor of Figures 10 and 11. One modification is to make the width of the N2 layer 3 small in comparison Ft the distance from the gate electrode assembly G1. Another modification of the device of Figures 10 and 11 is to make the width of the P1 layer 2 narrow in comparison with the distance from the first gate electrode assembly G1. Figures 12 and 13 show a modification of the gate controlled semiconductor device of Figures 10 and 11. In the device of Figures 12 and 13 which also employ the present invention, a gate electrode assembly G1 is provided on the centre portion of the surface of the N2 layer 5 and is constructed as the involute shape similar to the device in Figures 3 and 4. In the device of Figures 12 and 13, gold is partially diffused in the N1 layer 3 so that the concentration of the diffused gold 26 varies in accordance with the distance from the OFF gate electrode assembly G1 in order to change the life time of the carriers in the base layer N2 layer 3 . In more detail, the gold diffusion layer 26 is provided in the N3 layer 3 so that the concentration of the gold increases with tho distance from the centre portion ol the N2 layer 3. As one method for changing the life time of the carr crs, control of the radiation dose may also be employed. In accordance with the device as constructed above, carrier life time in the N1 layer 3 varies as is shown in Figure 14. I amely, carrier life time in the centre port Ion of the N2 layer 3 is longer than in the outer side portion thereof in accordance with the distance from the gate electrode assembly G1. Iben turning off the main current, the turn off operation is initiateS at the outcr portion in which the density of the diffused gola is high and far from the gate electrode, and thereafter the main current is finally interrupted at the centre per Lion in which the density of the diffused gold is low and in the vicinity of the gate electrode assembly G10 The present invention is not limited to the above described embodiments and the invention is also applicable to other various semiconductor devices such as, for example, a thyristor having an amplifying function, and the like. As is explained asith reference to the above various embodiments, in the gate controlled semiconductor device in accordance with the present invention, means for making small the internal impedance between a drain tern real of the gate electrode assembly and the portion where the main current is finally interrupted is substantially provided in the semiconductor device. Accordingly, it should be apparent that following advantages are obtained 1 the current interrupting capability is significantly improved in comparison with the prior art device 2 a good characteristic and economical gate turn off thyristor can be obtained by making the internal impendance of the gate current path small 3 since fabrication is simplified in comparison with a conventional gate controlled semiconductor cievnce, a high quality device is obtained without decreasing a yield and 4 since reduction o the junction area is avoided, a high performance device is obtained without decreasing its current capacity. Accordingly, it is to be understood that the embodiments described in detail are only illustrative of the general principles involved other embodiments may be devised consistent with the scope of the invention.
