# Fluid flow measurement.

## Abstract
Mass flow rate is measured utilising a pair of parallel con duits 36, 37 having fixed ends 34, 35, 42, 43 . A driving mechanism 48 is connected between the conduits 36, 37 near their mid point for applying transverse oscillations to the conduits at a selected frequency. The fluid whose mass flow rate is to be measured is divided approximately equally by a Y shaped passage 38 in a support 32 and is supplied through the parallel conduits 36,37 . A motion sensor 56 upstream of the driving mechanism 48 and another one 58 down stream of the driving mechanism produce signals which have the same frequency as the driving frequency but which lead or lag the driving frequency with regard to phase. This difference in phase is a measurement of mass flow rate and is measured by a phase measuring device 80 .
