## Description
This invention relates to molecular sieves and, more particularly, to molecular sieving metallosilicates of tetravalent Lanthanide and Actinide series metals. This invention also relates to a method for making such molecular sieving metallosilicates, and a method for converting methanol to olefins using such metallosilicates. The term molecular sieve refers to a wide variety of positive ion containing crystalline materials of both natural and synthetic varieties which exhibit the property of acting as sieves on a molecular scale. A major class of molecular sieves are crystalline aluminosilicates, although other crystalline materials are included in the broad definition. Examples of such other crystalline materials include coal, special active carbons, porous glass, microporous beryllium oxide powders, and layer silicates modified by exchange with organic cations. See, D. W. Breck, Zeolite Molecular Sieves Structure, Chemistry, and Use , John Wiley Sons, 1974. Zeolites are crystalline, hydrated, framework aluminosilicates which are based on a three dimensional network of AlO₄ and SiO₄ tetrahedra linked to each other by sharing all of the oxygens. Zeolites may be represented by the empirical formula The structural formula of a zeolite is best expressed for the crystallographic unit cell as M The zeolites described in the patent literature and published journals are designated by letters or other convenient symbols. Exemplary of these materials are Zeolite A U.S. Patent 2,882,243 , Zeotite X U.S. Patent 2,882,244 , Zeolite Y U.S. Patent 3,130,007 , Zeolite ZSM 5 U.S. Patent 3,702,886 , Zeolite ZSM 11 U.S. Patent 3,709,979 , and Zeolite ZSM 12 U.S. Patent 3,832,449 . Although there are 34 species of zeolite minerals and about 100 types of synthetic zeolites, only a few have been found to have practical significance. Many of the zeolites, after dehydration, are permeated by very small channel systems which are not interpenetrating and which may contain serious diffusion blocks. In other cases dehydration irreversibly disturbs the framework structure and the positions of metal cations, so that the structure partially collapses and dehydration is not completely reversible. To be efficiently used as a molecular sieve, the structure of the zeolite after complete dehydration must remain intact. There has been considerable interest in developing metallosilicates other than aluminosilicates which exhibit molecular sieve characteristics. For example, U.S. Patents 3,329,480 and 3,329,481 disclose crystalline zircano silicates and titano silicates, respectively. U.S. Patent 3,329,384 discloses group IV B metallosilicates. U.S. Patents 4,208,305, 4,238,315 and 4,337,176 disclose iron silicates. U.S. Patent 4,329,328 discloses zinco , stanno , and titano silicates. European patent applications 0 038 682 and 0 044 740 disclose cobalt silicates. European patent application 0 050 525 discloses nickel silicate. U.K. patent application GB 2,024,790 A discloses a silica based material which has been modified with one or more elements which have entered the crystalline lattice of the silica in place of silicon atoms of the silica or in the form of salts of bisilicic or polysilicic acids. The elements identified as being suitable for making such silica based materials are chromium, beryllium, titanium, vanadium, manganese, iron, cobalt, zinc, zirconium, rhodium, silver, tin, antimony and boron. U.S. Patent 4,299,808 discloses chromosilicates formed by reacting an aqueous mixture of an oxide of silicon, a compound of chromium, a hydroxide of an alkali or an alkaline earth metal, and an alkylammonium cation or a precursor of an alkylammonium cation. U.S. Patents 3,769,386, 4,192,778 and 4,339,354 relate to rare earth metal containing silicates. U.S. Patent 3,769,386 discloses zeolitic alumino metallosilicates crystallized from an aqueous reaction mixture containing Na₂O, SiO₂, Al₂O₃ and R In GB A 2,033,358 there is described a crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite composition related to the family of ZSM 5 zeolites having the formula, in terms of mole ratios of oxides There remains a need for suitable metallosilicates that exhibit molecular sieve character and employ tetravalent metals of the Lanthanide or Actinide series in their crystalline framework.

Exemplary heteropolymetallates that are useful include In the method of the present invention for making the metallosilicates, the mixture provided for in step A containing water, the oxide of silicon source, mineralizing and or synthesis directing agent, and tetravalent Lanthanide or Actinide metal containing compound is thoroughly mixed and then placed in a reactor. The reactor is preferably an enclosed reactor e.g., a static bomb style reactor . The contents are heated to a temperature in the range of 80 C to 300 C, preferably 125 C to 200 C, for a time to provide the desired molecular sieving metallosilicate, preferably for 4 hours to 30 days, more preferably about one to about ten days. The pressure within the reactor is preferably at at least the vapor pressure of water at the temperature of the reactor contents. The contents of the reactor are then allowed to cool to room temperature. The crystalline solids are separated from the mother liquor and washed thoroughly with water. Separation can be effected by conventional filtration techniques. The crystalline solids are then allowed to dry in air, such solids being the desired molecular sieving metallosilicates of the invention. The metallosilicates can be heat treated at a temperature of 300 C to 900 C, preferably 400 C to 600 C in an inert, oxidizing or reducing atmosphere for a sufficient time to pyrolyze any synthesis directing agent intermixed with such metallosilicates. The time period for this heat treating step is dependent upon the mass of material being treated. Preferably the heat treating step is conducted for at least about 30 minutes, but this time period can be more or less than 30 minutes depending upon the mass of material being treated. The inert atmosphere is preferably nitrogen, argon, helium or neon. The reducing atmosphere is hydrogen or a mixture of hydrogen and one of the above indicated inert gases. The reducing atmosphere can thus contain from 1 to 100 hydrogen, preferably 1 to 20 hydrogen, with the remainder being inert gas. The oxidizing atmosphere can be oxygen or a mixture of oxygen and one of the above indicated inert gases. The oxidizing atmosphere can thus contain from 1 to 100 oxygen, preferably from 1 to 20 oxygen with the remainder being inert gas. A preferred oxidizing atmosphere is air. The X ray diffraction pattern for these heat treated metallosilicates show the following significant lines The metallosilicates of the invention can be cation exchanged with an ammonium salt or a salt of a catalytically active metal. The salt of the catalytically active metal is preferably the salt of a Group VIII, IB or IIB metal, with zinc, copper, nickel, cobalt and iron being preferred. The anionic portions of these salts include the nitrates, phosphates, sulfates, acetates and halides. The cation exchange procedure employed herein is entirely conventional. Briefly, the metallosilicate and the ammonium salt or salt of catalytically active metal are dispersed in water for a few minutes to several hours, preferably one to ten hours, and maintained at room temperature to the boiling point of the water, then filtered and washed, with the result being the formation of such cation exchanged metallosilicates. Optionally, the cation exchanged metallosilicates can be heat treated in an inert, oxidizing or reducing atmosphere using the heat treating procedures described above to convert the cation exchanged species to a more active form. This heat treating procedure is particularly suitable for driving off ammonia from an ammonium metallosilicate to convert such metallosilicate to the acid form. An advantage of the present invention is that radioactive isotopes of the Lanthanide and Actinide series metals can be included in the synthesis of the metallosilicates of the invention, and thus such radioactive isotopes can be trapped within the stable metallosilicate structures provided herein. Thus the present invention provides a direct method for the encapsulation of such radioactive isotopes. The metallosilicates of the present invention can be used in many of the known applications for zeolites and molecular sieves. The crystalline structure of these metallosilicates make them particularly suitable as catalysts and adsorbents. The metallosilicates of the invention are particularly suitable for the reforming and dehydration of methanol by contacting one of said metallosilicates with methanol at an elevated temperature. The product produced thereby is typically a hydrocarbon mixture containing a mixture of paraffins and olefins of six or less carbon atoms, dimethyl ether, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. The methanol reactant can be in the form of pure methanol or it can be mixed with an inert gas such as nitrogen, argon, helium or neon. The reaction can be carried out in either a fluidized bed mode or fixed bed mode, continuously or in batch operation. The liquid hourly space velocity LHSV of the reactants is not critical but should be from 0.01 to 100, preferably from 0.05 to 10 liters of reactant per liter of catalyst per hour. The partial pressure of methanol over the catalyst should normally be atmospheric or subatmospheric. The reaction temperature should be maintained from 250 C to 600 C, preferably from 300 C to 500 C. The contact time of reactant with catalyst is generally from 0.1 seconds to 40 seconds, preferably from 1 second to 10 seconds. The product selectivities on a per carbon atom basis from the converted methanol using the metallosilicates of the invention typically are the following In order to further illustrate the present invention, the following examples are provided.
