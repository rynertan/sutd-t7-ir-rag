# Modified monoolefin copolymer elastomer with improved heat and oil resistance.

## Abstract
An EPM or EPDM type of elastomer is modified by graft copolymerization with acrylic ester type of monomeric material whose homopolymer has a glass transition tem perature of not greater than 6 C, in an amount sufficient to provide an ester group COO content of from 25 to 40 by weight, to yield a mixed copolymerizate vulcanizable to a heat and oil resistant elastomeric state.
