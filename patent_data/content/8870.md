## Description
HEAT SEALING ELEMENT AND METHOD OF HEAT SEALING TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to a packaging machine and method whereby sterilized and filled flanged containers are closed by lid stock secured to the flanges of the containers by a heat seal. BACKGROUND ART One known heat sealing means for sealing plastic materials utilizes a heat sealing member which is fluid heated and which includes a body of material of low thermal conductivity and a strip of material of high thermal conductivity in communication with a heat exchange fluid passage formed in the body of low thermal conductivity.This known structure utilizes nonyieldable pressure applying elements and hence is not well adapted for applying a uniform sealing pressure and temperature to areas to be sealed which are of irregular or nonuniform configuration.United States Patent 4,062,718 is representative of this known structure. Another known structure for sealing covers to containers utilizes a nonyieldable element arranged to apply heat and pressure to the lid of a container and thereby to seal the lid to the container flange and is arranged to cooperate with a yieldable bevelled compressible member against which the container flange rests. In this known arrangement, sealing pressure and temperature are not applied uniformly throughout the sealing area due in part at least to the bevelled or inclined disposition of the sealing surface of the yieldable compressible element.Canadian Patent 957,662 is representative of this known device. DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION According to this invention in one form, lid stock is sealed to the flange of a flanged container in such manner that a uniform application of pressure and heat is made to the lid stock by heated yieldable pressure applying means which includes a sealing block having a heat exchanging passage formed therein which is filled with heated liquid, the heat exchanging passage comprising a groove formed in a surface of the sealing block and a flexible membrane secured to the sealing block in overlying fluid tight outwardly protruding relation to the groove. As the yieldable flexible membrane is brought into pressure applying heat exchanging contact with the lid stock, the membrane is adapted to engage and apply uniform pressure throughout the sealing area of the lid stock irrespective of irregularities in the configuration or surface area of the lid stock or of the cooperating sealing area of the container flange due to the fact that the membrane is flexible and may thus conform to the configuration of the sealing area. According to one form of the invention, liquid disposed within the heat exchanging passage formed in the sealing block may be heated by heater units imbedded in the sealing block. In this arrangement a heat transfer passage may be formed in the sealing block and arranged in communication with the groove so that the application of sealing pressure by the flexible membrane effects a stirring or agitating action of the fluid whereby the membrane and fluid having given up heat during a sealing operation may be circulated within theheat transfer passage to a region therein adjacent the heater unit so that the temperature of the fluid is automatically regulated with the aid of the mechanical and hydraulic action on the fluid due to the performance of each sealing operation. The inventicn in another form utilizes a sealing block having a heat exchanging passage formed therein to which liquid is sied from a separate liquid reservoir and a controlled heater unit via flexible conduits. According to a preferred erbodirent of the invention, which is adapted for sealing flanged containers which are of circular configuration, the groove formed in the sealing block is circular and the flexible membrane is secured in overlying fluid tight relation to the groove formed in the sealing block by a pair of concentric rings which are secured to the sealing block by a plurality of screws which extend through the sealing membrane so as to grip the sealing membrane between the sealing rings and the surface of the sealing block in which the sealing groove is formed.Preferably the sealing membrane is configured so that the sealing portion thereof which is disposed between the clamping rings protrudes from the sealing block so as to form a doughnut shaped annular structure or so as to form an annular structure the lower portion of which is of a V shaped cross sectional configuration. If desired the membrane could be specially molded so as closely to conform with the shape of the sealing surface. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS For a better understanding of the invention, reference may be had to the accompanying drawings in whichFIG. 1 is a schematic representation of an aseptic packaging machine to which the sealing element of this invention is particularly well adapted FIG. 2 is a perspective view of a sealing element formed according to one embodiment of this invention FIG. 3 is a cross sectional view of the arrangement shown in FIG. 2 which is taken along the line designated 3 3 in FIG. 1 FIG. 4 is a view from below taken along the line designated 4 4 in FIG. 3 and in which FIG. 5 is a schematic system view of a second embodiment of the invention. BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION Referring to FIG. 1, the packaging apparatus is generally indicated by the numeral 1 and is fully enclosed by a hood or shroud which permits sealing of the interior thereof from outside ambient air, a feature which permits maintenance of sterile and inert atmospheric conditions inside the machine. Located inside the machine is a cup conveying means 2, which is composed of a series of orifice carrier plates connected together with chains to form an endless belt. The orifice carrier plates have holes which are shaped to conform to the shape of the preformed cups, which cups extend through the plate and are retained with the cup sealing flanges conforming to the shaped surfaces of the plates.The cup conveying means 2 passes around a series of drive and guide sprockets 3, 4, 5, and 6 so that the cup conveying means can move the cups through a sequence of machine operations as set forth below. A supply of preformed cups is provided as indicated at 7, the cups being positively delivered into orifices in the carrier plates of the cup conveying means which carries the cups around guide sprocket 3 into a generally downward travel. Continuing downwardly and around sprocket 4, the cups are carried below the surface of a reservoir of liquid sterilant 10 contained in sterilant tank 9. As the cup conveying means travels around sprocket 4, the cups are turned to a inverted position. Cup retainer rail 8 is disposed along the path of travel of the cups through this portion of the machine to prevent cups from falling out of the orifice carrier plates, while inverted, by action of gravity.The arrangement of the cup travel through the sterilant tank or reservoir is such that the cups are completely flooded with the liquid sterilant and all traces of air are displaced therefrom to insure liquid contact over all internal surfaces of the cups. The supply of sterilant in tank 9 is maintained at a temperature in the range of 600C. to 1000C., and the speed of travel through the sterilant is such as to keep the cups immersed in the liquid for a period of one to sixty seconds Fresh sterilant is supplied to tank 9 from a source outside the machine not shown , and sterilant from the machine tank 9 is continuously recirculated through filtering and heating means not shown to maintain the temperature and cleanliness thereof. Following passage through the sterilant bath, the cups travel upwardly out of the sterilant tank and around guide sprocket 5 and then generally horizontally to drive sprocket 6. Sterilant drains from the inverted cups during this portion of their travel through the machine. The entire inner atmosphere of the machine is an inert sterile gas such as nitrogen. If desired, jets of sterile inert gas may be directed inside the cups during this portion of their travel to sweep remaining traces of the liquid sterilant therefrom. Such gas jets 11 may also be directed to the sealing rim or flange areas of the cups to insure that such sealing areas are dry and free of liquid which might interfere with the later sealing operation. Next, the cup conveying means travels around sprocket 6, turning the cups to an upright position, and then carries them to filler station 12. Here, filler nozzle 13 delivers a meter amount of food product into each cup, and nozzle 13 is supplied by conduit 14 with presterilized food product. Filler 12 and its associated parts are designed to deliver food product into the cups without splashing of the food, and without contaminating the sealing flange or rim of the cups with particles or droplets of the food product. The cup conveying means next carries the cups to a sealing station, indicated generally at 15. A supply web of cover material 16 is passed through a sterilant bath 17 and into proximity above the flanges of the cups. Sealer 15, operating heat sealing element 18,applies the cover material to the top of the filled cups and seals the cover material thereto by the action of heat and pressure. Reciprocating vertical movement of the sealing element 18 is permitted by flexible diaphragm 19 which separates the sealing element from the sterile and inert atmosphere of the interior of the machine. If desired, the cover material may be cut to the desired shape of the cup and waste cover material can be stripped from the cups b die cutting and stripping means 20, the waste material, still interconnected, passing out of the machine and being wound into a roll for easy disposal.Alternatively, the cover web may be pre cut into strands of interconnected covers prior to delivery to the machine, and, following the sealing operation, merely cut apart, thus eliminating any stripping Oi waste cover material from the filled and sealed cups. Note that cutting means 20 may be located immediately following sealing means 15, or may be spaced therefrom and follow after cups have moved past a microbiological barrier 21. This barrier may suitably be a liquid sterilant curtain, which separates the interior, sterile part of the machine from the ambient air. The cup conveying means next carries the finished cups to an ejection mechanism indicated at 22 where cups are displaced from the cup conveying means and removed from the machine as indicated at 23. Thereafter, the cup conveying means completes its travel and returns to cup supply means 7. While details are not shown, drive means for the cup conveying means may be conveniently located in the lower portion of the machine as indicated at 24.Motion of the cup conveying means is intermittent and is synchronized with the operation of filler means 12, sealing means 15, and cutting and stripping means 20. According to this invention and as shown in FIGS.2 and 3, sealing element 15 includes a sealing block 25 supported by vertically reciprocable plunger 26 whose up and down motion is imparted by means of fluid motor 27.This fluid motor comprises a piston and cylinder mechanism of known construction which is operated by a source of air or liquid under pressure not shown in the drawings which is interconnected with the fluid motor 27 via conduit 28.Fluid motor 27 is supported by plate 29 which in turn is mounted on support blocks 30 secured to the frame 31 of the machine. If desired some other known mechanical drive could be used instead of fluid motor 27. As is best shown in FIG. 3, cup conveying means generally designated by the numeral 2 comprises a pair of chains 32 and 33 supported by guide rails 34 and 35.Interposed between and supported by chains 32 and 33 are slide blocks 36 and 37 which are slidable along rails 38 and 39 respectively. Interposed between slide blocks 36 and 37 are a plurality of cup retaining apertured carrier plates 40 each of which is provided along its upper surface with a recess 41. Thus a cup 7 such as is indicated at C in FIG. 3 ,. flfl t9 i n tho opening 42 in carrier plate 40 with the flange F of the container C disposed in the recess 41.The lid stock from which the closure for the container C is formed is indicated at S in FIG. 3. It is thus apparent that downward motion of the sealing block 25 imparted by fluid motor 27 causes the lid stock S to be moved into pressure contact with the flange F of container C. According to this invention, a flexible sealing membrane M which preferably is about three mils thick is secured to the lower surface 43 of sealing block 25 by a pair of retaining elements 44 and 45. These seal retaining elements 44 and 45 are secured to the sealing block 25 by screws 46 and 46a so as to form a fluid tight junction between the membrane M and the sealing block 25 so that liquid L disposed within the annular groove 47 is secured in fluid tight relation therein. Thus the groove or passage 47 constitutes a heat exchanging passage which as illustrated in FIG. 3 is in the form of a groove 47 formed in surface 43 of sealing block 25. Preferably the peripheral configuration of the flexible and resilient sealing membrane X corresponds to the flanged opening of the article and is shaped so as to apply uniform sealing pressure to the flange. Thus for cups having a downwardly sloping flange, the membrane may be of V shaped contour and positioned so that it will apply sealing pressure progressively from the inner to the outer region of the sloping flange as the membrane is moved downwardly into sealing contact. The material used to form the membrane must be highly resistant to heat and be adaptable to being permanently shaped in a desired configuration. Oil derived from petroleum may be used as the fluid L. Its temperature preferably is maintained in a range between 900C. and 300 C. For most applications of the invention the fluid L will be a liquid when at operating temperature. The invention is not limited to liquids however and the term fluid is intended to include other media, some of which are identified below. Whatever medium is omnl ovnd should be capable of withstanding a temperature of 300 C. without breakdown and should have high heat capacity and high thermal conductivity. Glycerol could be used as could a silicone oil produced by Dow ChemicalCompany and marketed as Dowtherm. Solder, mercury and an oil having metallic particles suspended therein could also be used.Such particles could be aluminum, copper, silver, iron and other metals Wax and steam can also be used. Arranged in communication with the heat exchanging passage 47 is an annular heat transfer passage H which also contains heated fluid. For the purpose of applying heat to the sealing block 25 and in turn to the fluid L in heat exchanging passage 47 and in heat transfer passage H, a heater unit 48 is imbedded within the sealing block 25. Of course this heater unit could be ring shaped or could take the form of a plurality of heater units disposed about the body of sealing block 25. A temperature indicating element 49 preferably is arranged with its temperature sensing element 50 imbedded within a passage formed in sealing block 25 and preferably in close proximity to the lower surface 43 of block 25. With the heat exchanging passage 47 and the heat transfer passage H filled with heated liquid such as oil, downward motion of the sealing block 25 and parts associated therewith applies heat and pressure to the lid stockS and effects a bond between the lid stock and the flangeF of container C. Since the flange F of container C as indicated in FIG. 3 is downwardly bevelled and since the film of membrane M is flexible, it is apparent that the membrane M is well adapted to apply pressure and temperature to lid stock S and to the flange F which are uniform throughout the sealing area irrespective of variations in the configuration of the lid stock S or the flange F or in the surface areas to be sealed in contact with each other. In addition the fact that heat transfer passageH is in direct communication with heat exchange passage 47 and H to cause a redistribution of the liquid so that heat given up from the liquid through the membrane M is replaced due to the proximity of liquid within heat transfer passage H to the heater means 48. By this means the repetitive operation of the sealing element results in a continuous redistribution of heat throughout the body of the liquid thus maintaining uniform sealing temperature of the sealing membrane M. According to another feature of the invention, the lid stock is stretched somewhat during the sealing operation due to the fact that the membrane M by frictional engagement with the lid stock places the lid stock in tension about the downwardly bevelled flange F as is obvious from FIG 3. As shown in FIG 3 the melrbrarle M is of V shaped cross sectlonw configuration. It will be understood that the invention is not limited to this particular configuration but that for some applications of the invention other configurations are desirable such for example as arcuate stepped or other special cross sectional configurations. The membrane M is preset in configuration as is desired for a particular application of the invention. Instead of heating the liquid by heater elements such as 48 imbedded in the sealing block 25 as shown inFIG. 3, the liquid L supplied to the heat exchanging passage 47 and the heat transfer passage H may be heated by a unit which is separate and apart from the movable sealing block 25. Such an arrangement is indicated schematically in FIG. 5 in which a fluid reservoir 51 is connected by a conduit 52 and pump P with a heater 53 whose temperature is controlled by control device TC.Thus liquid is supplied through conduit 54 and valve 55 to manifold 56 from whence it is supplied through flexible conduit 57 to the sealing block schematically indicated at 25a Of course connection of conduit 57 is by way of a suitable passageway indicated by dotted lines 58 in FIG. 3 to the heat exchanging passage 47 and the heat transfer passage H Fluid from the sealing block 25 is returned via the Dassaqe indicated in dotted lines in FIG. 3 by the numeral 59 which in turn is connected with flexible conduit 60 to the manifold 56 and thence through valve 61 and conduit 62 to reservoir 51. If desired a suitable temperature gauge 63a may be arranged so as to monitor the operating conditions and supplemental control may be achieved by conduit 63 and valve 64. While many materials may be used in the construction of the flexible membrane M, one suitable material is manufactured and sold by E.I. DuPont deNemours Co.,Wilmington, Delaware, under the trademark Kapton which is described as a polyimide film. Another suitable material is silicone rubber. Of course the container 7 and the lid stock S may be formed of any known suitable plastic material and may take the form of laminated or other structures.
