# A color photographic light sensitive material.

## Abstract
A color photographic light sensitive material comprises a support and thereon a hydrophilic colloidal layer compris ing a nondiffusible coupler and a hydrophilic colloidal layer comprising an aromatic primary amine developing agent and or a precursor thereof. The color photographic light sensitive material further comprises a polymer layer at the furthest position from the support on the same side of said hydrophilic colloidal layer, which polymer layer is permeable to an alkaline processing liquid but less permeable to said aromatic primary amine developing agent and or precursor thereof.
