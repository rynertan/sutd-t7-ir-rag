# Process for reducing lead peroxide formation during lead electrowinning and an electrolyte for electrowinning lead.

## Abstract
An electrolyte and a process for reducing lead peroxide formation when electrowinning lead from inorganic acid solu tions are disclosed. In accordance with the invention, arsenic is added to an inorganic acid electrolyte containing lead, whereby oxygen is evolved at the anode while lead peroxide formation is reduced or eliminated during electrolysis.
