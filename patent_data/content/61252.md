## Description
TUBE DIAPHRAGM VALVE This invention is concerned with flow valves and more particularly with the type of flow valves known as tube valves. Tube valves are axial flow valves wherein a tube or sleeve is used for controlling flow through the valves. Such valves are shown for example in U.S.Patents 3,942,756 and 3,838,704. Tube valves generally have a pervious cage like core extending from an inlet to an outlet of a casing surrounding the core. A resilient tube is fitted over the core between the casing and the core. A control chamber defined between the casing and the tube is used for operating the valve between closed and open positions. The closed position occurs when the tube abuts a central impervious barrier portion that transverses the longitudinal direction of the cage like core. The tube valves give excellent control over large volume flows. They are characterized by good reliability and longevity. The prior art tube valves are pone to the phenomena known as water hammer .The water hammer problem can be diminished by using larger valves per volume of flow being controlled.When larger valves are used the head loss through the valve increases in addition to the inherent additional costs of the larger valve. Thus there is a problem of long standing in reducing water hammer effect and still minimizing the size of the tube valves. It is an object of the present invention to provide new and improved tube valves in which the abovereferred to disadvantages are substantially reduced or overcome. According to the present invention a tube valve is provided comprising valve casing means first and second port means longitudinally spaced apart in said casing means a hollow support structure having pervious walls in a longitudinal direction between said port means an impervious barrier transversing the longitudinal direction of said structure positioned to cause flow through said pervious walls and around said barrier tube means surrounding said structure and extending substantially from first port means to second port means said tube means having a valve closed position abutting said barrier thereby preventing flow around said barrier and a valve opened position removed from said barrier thereby enabling flow around said barrier said casing means and said tube means defining a control chamber aperture means in said casing to enable varying the pressure in said control chamber to move said tube means, said closed and said opened positions and said barrier adapted to control resistance to the movement of said tube means from said open position to said closed position thereby damping any water hammer effect caused by said movement. A further feature of the invention provides ceratin flow passageways in said barrier. to further control the change in characteristics of the tube movements to overcome the inherent water hammer effect. The operation and utilization of the present. invention will be more fully apparent from the descrip tion of a preferred embodiment taken in.conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a cross sectional view of the in ventive tube valve showing it in the closed position and the complete open position, Fig. 2 is a cross sectional view of the. same valve showing it in the process of closing, Figs. 3a and 3E we schematic showings of prior art tube valves to illustrate the water hammer effect, and FigS. 4a and 4b are schematic showings of the improved valve in the process of closing to illustrate how the water hammer effect is minimized. In Fig. 1 the tube valve 11 is shown in crosssection view in its normal closed position. The valve comprises a casing having an outer wall 12 and end closures 13 and 14. The end closures are shown as having an inlet port 16 in end closure 13 and an outlet port 17 in end closure 14. It should be understood while 16 is referred to herein as an inlet port and 17 as an outlet port, the valve is shown as being symmetrically constructed so that flow can occur in either direction. The valve further comprises a central core shown generally as 18. The core is comprised of a cage like structure made up of an annular array of fingers extending from end enclosure 13 to a central barrier assembly 19 and from end enclosure 14 to the central barrier assembly 19. The central barrier assembly 19 is shown as comprised of a centrally disposed cylindrical section 21 which has a larger diameter than a pair of truncated conical sections 22 and 23 on the inlet and outlet sides of the central cylindrical section 21, respectively.The conical sections 22 and 23 have their smaller diameters on those portions of the conical sections that abut the cylindrical section. Accordingly the conical sections flare away from the cylindrical section and grow larger as they extend towards the ends of the valve. The conical sections 22 and 23 also have peripheral slots therein shown as slots 24 and 26 on sections 22 and 23, respectively. These slots add to the damping effect that the conical sections have on the movement of the tubing. It should be noted that while two slots are shown, one on each of the conical sections, more slots can be utilized or the area the cross section area of the slot can be varied, depending on the characteristic reaction desired from the valve. The cage structure 18 is shown as comprising the annular array of fingers such as fingers 27 and 28 on the inlet side defining an inflow slot 29 and such as fingers 31 and 32 on the outlet side defining an outflow slot 33. The cage is normally abutted by the sleeve or tube 34 which is an elastic member normally stretched tightly over the cage so as to abut the. central barrier assembly 19 and preventany flow froitithe inlet to the outlet The casing 12 and the tube 34 define a control chamber 36. An aperture means, such. as aperture 37 in casing 12 provides an entrance way to the control chamber. When the control chamber is attached to a fluid source at the same pressure as the inlet fluid supply, then the valve is retained in the closed position shown in the full line drawing of Fig. 1. If however the control chamber 36 is attached to a drain so that the inlet pressure is greater than the pressure in the control chamber, the valve then opens and the tube assumes the dashed line shape shown at 34a, for example. The valve can be used for throttling purposes in which case the tube assumes a position somewhere between the position of tube shown in 34 and 34a. Note that the tube 34 is shown as held between the end closures and the casing. The manner of retaining the tube in place could be done in any manner well known to those skilled in the art. Fig. 2 shows the valve in the process of closing. To better show the improved features provided by the novel central barrier assembly 19 , the numerical designations in Fig. 2 are the same1 as those of Fig.1 wherever possible. In Fig. 2 the aperture 37 has been connected to the line pressure that is also connected to inlet 16. Accordingly , the control chamber 36 is at line pressures Then the tube 34 moves towards the cage assembly on the outlet side much faster than it does on the inlet side. Because of the heat loss across the barrier assembly 19 there is less pressure from the interior of the core toward the casing on the outlet side than there is one the inlet side. Therefore the tube on the inlet side moves more slowly toward the core than does the tube on the outlet side. The relative motion ofthe tube towards the core when the compartment and the inlet have the same applied pressure is shown in Figs. 3 and 4. Initially when the control compartment pressure and inlet pressure are equal there is no distinguishable difference in the motion of the tubes between the prior art valves and the inventive valves. This is illustrating by comparingFig. 3a and Fig. 4a. In both figures the tube has moved to a relatively horizontal position and the compartment is filled with hydraulic fluid, i.e water. However, as the tube gets closer to the outlet corner of the cylindrical section 21 in the prior art valve, the head drop through the valve increases. Con sequently, the pressure in the control chamber in the prior art valves forces the tube on the outlet side into juxtaposition with the cage at .an ever accelerating rate Thus the outlet sidetube drops down ta the cage so as to cause the water hammer effect. The new valve of Pigs 4 has the side conical section which slows the tubes descent on the outlet side thereby preventing water hammer. Not e that while sections 2Z and 23. are shown as having conical shapes they could also be cylindrical, and produce the desired effects. Similarly they can be wall like sections or disc like sections. The major diameter of sections 22 and 23 should however be less than the diameter of central section 21. Also if one side of the valve is always the outlet then only one side section is required, that is of course on the outlet side. The slots, shown as 24 and 26 are also important to mute the hammer effect, The slots can be of different sizes or more than one slot can be provided depending on the rating of the valve. The valve provided retains the relatively small physical dimensions of the tube valves but by slowing the movement of the tube 34 on the outlet side, the hammer effect is minimized, or muted. Accordingly a flowthrough tube valve is provided that does not suffer from the usual hammer effect which has been known to cause extensive dainage to hydraulic systems as well as to the valve. The muting of the hammer effect is accomplished without enlarging the size of the valve. and without materially changing the reaction time of the diaphragm . While the principles of the invention have been described above in conne ction with the specific apparatus and applications, it is to be understood that this description is made by way of example only and not as a limitation on the scope of the invention.
