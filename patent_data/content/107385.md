## Description
A METHOD OF PRODUCING A ZEOLITE CONTAINING OCCLUDED MULTIMETALITE AND THE PRODUCT OF SUCH A METHOD This invention relates to a method of producing crystalline zeolites which are occluded with multimetalites. Such heterogeneous compositions have the ability to serve as catalysts in a wide range of hydrocarbon conversion reactions. The cracking activity of the subject zeolites may vary according to the composition of the multimetalite occluded therein. Zeolitic materials, both natural and synthetic, have been demonstrated in the past to have catalytic properties for various types of hydrocarbon conversions. Certain zeolitic materials are ordered, porous crystalline aluminosilicates having a definite crystalline structure within which there are a large number of smaller cavities which may be interconnected by a number of still smaller channels.Since the dimensions of these pores are such as to admit for adsorption molecules of certain dimensions while rejecting those of larger dimensions, these materials have come to be known as molecular sieves .and are utilized in a variety of ways to take advantage of these properties. Such molecular sieves, both natural and synthetic, include a wide variety of positive ion containing crystalline aluminosilicates.These aluminosilicates can be described as a rigid three dimensional framework SiO4 and A104 in which the tetrahedra are cross linked by the sharing of oxygen atoms whereby the ratio of the total aluminum and silicon atoms to oxygen is 1 2. The spaces between the tetrahedra are occupied by molecules of water prior to dehydration. The electrovalence of the tetrahedra containing aluminum is balanced by the inclusion in the crystal of a cation, for example, an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal cation. This can be expressed wherein the ratio of aluminum to the number of various cations, such as Ca 2, Sr 2, Na, K or Li is equal to unity. One type of cation may be exchanged either entirely or partially by another type of cation utilizing ion exchange techniques in a conventional manner.By means of such cation exchange, it has been possible to vary the properties of a given aluminosilicate by suitable selection of the cation. Heterogeneous catalytic compositions are known which comprise a zeolite having a metal or metal compound impregnated within the zeolite. The intrazeolite metal or metal compound exhibits catalytic activity when dispersed within the intracrystalline spaces of the zeolite. Examples of such impregnated zeolites and methods for producing them are disclosed in U.S Patent No. 3,344,058, U.S. PatentNo. 3,373,109 and U.S. Patent No. 3,509,042. These prior art methods of incorporating metals or metal compounds generally involve introducing a water soluble metal compound into a zeolite forming mixture prior to crystallization of the zeolite. The resulting wet metal containing crystalline zeolite is thereafter dried and subsequently subjected to a thermal treatment, preferably in hydrogen.The finished catalyst contains the metal component distributed in the zeolitic structure in metallic form. Zeolites which are occluded with metals according to the above described conventional methods are subject to substantial limitations. In particular, occluded metals of such zeolites may not be adequately anchored within the zeolite channels. Under the severe conditions of temperature and pressure encountered in catalysis, occluded metals migrate from the zeolite channels to the zeolite surface. A reducing atmosphere or the presence of hydrocarbon exacerbates this migration. Accordingly, there is a need for materials which exhibit the catalytic characteristics of free metals or metal compounds when occluded within zeolites which are not susceptible to migration from the zeolite channels under catalytic reaction conditions. Alloys having reduced vapor pressures have been suggested as free metal substitutes.In particular, multimetalites such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent No.3,752,776 to Chester et al. have been investigated in this regard. Multimetalites are a class of inorganic materials having the ability to serve as catalysts in a wide range of hydrocarbon conversion reactions. The empirical formula of these compounds can be written 1 2 Mx3. . . Mxn Dy where Mxl, Mx2, Mx3 and Mxn are catalytically active metals.The subscripts of the various symbols should reflect the empirical composition using the Law of Definite Proportions, i.e., the smallest whole numbers. U.S. Patent No. 3,752,776 to Chester et al. discloses a method for preparing multimetalite catalysts by thermally decomposing inorganic compounds known as heteropoly amines which comprise a transition metal complex and a heteropoly anion. These compounds can be represented by the general empirical formula EMLN m n M xM y z where M a transition metal or a mixture of a transition metal with hydrogen N the number of ligands LN a set of N ligands at least one of which functions as a reducing agent m the charge on the anion n the charge on the cation M a transition metal or non metal or hydrogen M a metal selected from the group consisting of Group V B and VI B metals x is 1 or 2 y is between 5 and 20 z is between 20 and 50 Thermal decomposition of these compounds produce multimetalites and materials which can be represented by the following formula M M M 0 m n x y w where M is derived from the cation of a compound of the above type wherein said cation is hydrogen, or a transition metal or mixture thereof with each other, M is a metal or a non metal and M is derived from the metal which is represented by M11 in the parent compound and w is a number representing the number of oxygen atoms and is less than z noted hereinbefore. Generally at least two of M, and M differ from each other.For purposes of illustration the products of the thermal decomposition of the compounds CO NH3 6 MMo6024H63 x H2 where M Co, Fe, Cr and Al should be written as follows CoCoMo6O19 CoFeMo6O19 CoCrMo6019 CoAlMo6019 In addition to the above described heteropoly amine precursors, multimetalites can also be derived from a mixture of metal salts and or metal oxides said mixture containing at least two different metal components and exhibiting catalytic activity when incorporated within a zeolite. Suitable metal components include one or more of the metals ofGroups Ia, Ib, IIa, IIb, IIIa, IV, V, VI, VII and VIII of the PeriodicTable. Representative of these metals are copper, zinc, rare earths, actinium, titanium, tin, molybdenum, chromium, tungsten, iron, vanadium, cobalt, nickel, manganese, and metals of the platinum group, i.e., platinium, palladium, osmium, rhodium, ruthenium and iridium as well as combinations of these metals, their salts, oxides or sulfides.Representative of the anion of the catalytically active metal salts which can be employed to base exchange the aluminosilicates include chlorides, bromides, iodides, carbonates, bicarbonates, sulfates, sulfides, thiocyanates, dithiocarbonates, peroxysulfates, acetates, benzoates, oxalates, citrates, fluorides, nitrates, nitrites, formates, etc. The preferred salts are chlorides, nitrates, sulfates and acetates. A preferred group of metal components are those selected fromGroup VIII of the Periodic Table, such as cobalt, nickel and the platinum series, which are particularly useful in hydrogenation dehydrogenation and hydrocracking reactions. The amount of catalytically active metal components encased within the crystalline structure of the aluminosilicate may vary widely and will depend upon the charge stock undergoing conversion as well as on the particular nature of the metal component. Generally, the amount of each metal component will be within the range of .05 to 20 percent by weight. When a metal of the platinum series is employed, the amount thereof will generally range from .05 to 5 weight percent. With other metal components such as molybdenum, cobalt, tungsten, chromium, iron, vanadium, and nickel, the amounts employed will generally be within the range of .05 to 20 weight percent, it being understood that in any instance, the amount of metal component will be such as to afford selective conversion of the portion of the charge mixture making contact with the active catalytic surfaces and undergoing conversion. Multimetalites have been found to catalyze a wide variety of reactions, such as hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, isomerization, hydrogenolysis, combustion of carbon monoxide, decomposition of nitric oxide, cracking and hydrocracking of hydrocarbons, reforming, aromatization, dehydrocyclization, alkylation, hydrodesulfurization, denitrogenation, disproportionation, carbonylation, hydroformylation, polymerization and nitrogen fixation. They can be used as catalysts by themselves, in conjunction with supports such as alumina, silica, clay and the like and can also be treated with hydrogen to improve their catalytic capabilities. However, conventional techniques for impregnating zeolites with aqueous solutions of multimetalite precursors have not been successful. According to the invention there is provided in one aspect a method for producing a zeolite material containing occluded multimetalite which comprises combining a starting zeolite material, a multimetalite precursor, and a liquid, predominantly non aqueous inorganic solvent for the precursor to produce a zeolite which is impregnated by the multimetalite precursor drying the impregnated zeolite material to remove the solvent and calcining the resulting dried zeolite to convert the occluded multimetalite precursor to occluded mult imetalite. In a further aspect, the invention resides in a zeolite material containing occluded multimetalite prepared by impregnating a zeolite with a multimetalite precursor dissolved in a liquid, predominantly non aqueous inorganic solvent, drying the multimetalite precursor impregnated product to remove the solvent, and calcining the dried product to convert multimetalite precursor to multimetalite The resulting metal containing zeolite comprises immooilized intrazeolitic metal components which resist migration from the zeolite interior even under severe conditions. The crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite material used herein have unusually low alumina contents2 i.e., high silica to alumina mole ratios, such that they are very active even when the silica to alumina mole ratio exceeds 30. Such activity is surprising, since catalytic activity is generally attributed to framework aluminum atoms and or cations associated with these aluminum atoms. These zeolites retain their crystallinity for long periods in spite of the presence of steam at high temperatures which induces irreversible collapse of the framework of other zeolites, e.g., of the X and A type Furthermore, carbonaceous deposits, when formed, may be removed by burning at higher than usual temperatures to restore activity.These zeolites, used as catalysts, generally have low coke forming activity and therefore are conducive to long times on stream between regenerations by burning carbonaceous deposits with oxygen containing gas such as air. An important characteristic of the crystal structure of this particular class of zeolites is that it provides a selective constrained access to and egress from the intracrystalline free space by virtue of having an effective pore size intermediate between the small pore LindaA and the large pore Linde X, i.e., the pore windows of the structure are of about a size such as would be provided by 10 memberea rings of silicon atoms interconnected by oxygen atoms. It is to be understood, of course, that these rings are those formed by the regular disposition of the tetrahedra making up the anionic framework of the crystalline zeolite, the oxygen atoms themselves being bonded to the silicon or aluminum atoms at the centers of the tetrahedra.Briefly, the preferred type zeolites useful in this invention possess, in combination a silica to alumina mole ratio of at least about 12 and a structure providing constrained access to the intracrystalline free space. The silica to alumina mole ratio referred to may be determined by conventional analysis. This ratio is meant to represent, as closely as possible, the ratio in the rigid anionic framework of the zeolite crystal and to exclude aluminum in the binder or in cationic or other form within the channels. Although zeolites with a silica to alumina mole ratio of at least 12 are useful, it is preferred in some instances to use zeolites having substantially higher silica alumina ratios, e.g., 70 and above or even 1600 and above. In addition, zeolites as otherwise characterized herein but which are substantially free of aluminum, that is zeolites having silica to alumina mole ratios of up to infinity, are found to be useful and even preferable in some instances. Such high silica or highly siliceous zeolites are intended to be included within this description. Members of this particular class of zeolites, after activation, acquire an intracrystalline sorption capacity for normal hexane which is greater than that for water, i.e., they exhibit hydrophobic properties. This hydrophobic character can be used to advantage in some applications. The zeolites of the particular class useful herein have an effective pore size such as to freely sorb normal hexane. In addition, their structure must provide constrained access to larger molecules. It is sometimes possible to judge from a known crystal structure whether such constrained access exists. For example, if the only pore windows in a crystal are formed by 8 membered rings of silicon and aluminum atoms, then access by molecules of larger cross section than normal hexane is excluded and the zeolite is not of the desired type. Windows of l0 membered rings are preferred, although in some instances excessive puckering of the rings or pore blockage may render these zeolites ineffective. Twelve membered rings usually do not offer sufficient constraint to produce the advantageous conversions, although the puckered 12 ring structure of TMA offretite shows constrained access.Other 12 ring structures may exist which may be operative. Rather than attempt to judge from crystal structure whether or not a zeolite possesses the necessary constrained access to molecules of larger cross section than normal paraffins, a simple determination of the Constraint Index may be used. The meaning of Constraint Index and its method of determination are fully decribed in, for example2 U.S.Patent No. 3,9052915. The preferred class of zeolites used herein includes zeolite beta, ZSM 5, ZSM 5 ZSM ll intermediates, ZSM ll, ZSM 12, ZSM 23, ZSM 35,ZSM 38, ZSM 48 and other similar materials. ZSM 5 is particularly preferred. Zeolite beta is described in U.S. Patent No. 3,308,069. ZSM 5 is described in greater detail in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,702,886 and Re 29,948. ZSM 5 ZSM ll intermediate compositions are described in U.S.Patent No. 4,229,424. ZSM ll is described in U.S. Patent No.3,709,979. ZSM 12 is described in U.S. Patent No. 3,832,449. ZSM 23 is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,076,842. ZSM 35 is described in U.S.Patent No. 4,016,245. ZSM 38 is more particularly described in U.S.Patent No. 4,046,859. ZSM 48 is more particularly described in EuropeanPatent Publication No. 0015132. The specific zeolites described, when prepared in the presence of organic cations, are substantially catalytically inactive, possibly because the intracrystalline free space is occupied by organic cations from the forming solution. They may be activated by heating in an inert atmosphere at 5400C for one hour, for example, followed by base exchange with ammonium salts followed by calcination at 5400C in air. The presence of organic cations in the forming solution may not be absolutely essential to the formation of this type zeolite however, the presence of these cations does appear to favor the formation of this special class of zeolite. More generally, it is desirable to activate this type catalyst by base exchange with ammonium salts followed by calcination in air at 5400C for from 15 minutes to about 24 hours. Natural zeolites may sometimes be converted to zeolite structures of the class herein identified by various activation procedures and other treatments such as base exchange, steaming, alumina extraction and calcination, alone or in combinations. Natural minerals which may be so treated include ferrierite, brewsterite, stilbite, dachiardite, epistilbite, heulandite, and clinoptilolite. In a preferred aspect of this invention, the zeolites hereof are selected as those providing among other things a crystal framework density, in the dry hydrogen form, of not less than about 1.6 grams per cubic centimeter. The dry density for known structures may be calculated from the number of silicon plus aluminum atoms per 1000 cubicAngstroms, as described on page 19 of the article Zeolite Structure byW.M. Meier, included in Proceedings of the Conference on MolecularSieves, London, April, 1967 published by the Society of ChemicalIndustry, London, 1968. When the crystal structure is unknown, the crystal framework density may be determined by classical pycnometer techniques. For example, it may be determined by immersing the dry hydrogen form of the zeolite in an organic solvent which is not sorbed by the crystal. Or, the crystal density may be determined by mercury porosimetry, since mercury will fill the interstices between crystals but will not penetrate the intracrystalline free space. Multimetalite precursors suited for occlusion in the zeolite compositions of the present invention include the metal amine heteropoly salts described in U.S. Patent No. 3,752,776. Multimetalite precursors may also include a mixture of metal salts and or metal oxides, said mixture containing at least two different metal species, such precursors being described in greater detail above. The metal species of the multimetalites derived from these precursors exhibit catalytic activity when occluded or incorporated within a zeolite. Metal salts suitable for inclusion in multimetalite precursors include metal chlorides and metal nitrates as well as ammonium metal oxides. Preferred metal salts include hydrated metal nitrates such as Zn NO 6H20, Al N03 3 9H20, Cr N03 3 9H20, Ce N03 3 3 3 9H20, and Co N03 2 6H20. Metal oxides or metal chlorides sucn as MoO3 and GaCl3 may supplement or replace metal salts in a multimetalite precursor. The multimetalite precursors are introduced within the zeolite by dissolving the precursors in a liquid, non aqueous, inorganic solvent, and preferably an ammonia solvent and contacting the zeolite with the multimetalite solution. The ammonia solvent can be anhydrous liquid ammonia or ammonia mixed with less than about 50 weight percent water. Other suitable solvents include liquid SO2. A HZSM 5 zeolite suitable for use in the present invention can be prepared from low sodium ZSM 5 which has been calcined in an inert atmosphere to drive off any organic template ions remaining after synthesis. The calcined zeolite can then be activated by heating in air. In one embodiment of the present invention, the activatedHZSM 5 is combined with all the components of the multimetalite precursors, e.g., a mixture of hydrated metal nitrates, such asZn N03 6H20 and Al N03 3 9H20. The ammonia solvent can then be added to the zeolite multimetalite precursor mixture.Addition of the ammonia solvent dissolves the multimetalite precursor and the resulting solution permeates the zeolite structure resulting in intrazeolite occlusion of the multimetalite precursors. The zeolite is then heated under generally mild temperatures ranging from room temperature to 200 OC, preferably 110 to 150 OC, say 1300C, in order to drive off the ammonia solvent. The resulting dried composition is then calcined at temperatures ranging from 250 to 6500C, preferably 300 to 5000C, say 3500C, for periods ranging from 0.5 to 24 hours2 preferably 1 to 4 hours. Such calcining converts the multimetalite precursors to multimetalites, resulting in zeolite compositions containing virtually immobilized occluded multimetalites. Alternative embodiments include the addition of an ammonia solvent multimetalite precursor solution to the dried zeolite or alternatively the addition of an ammonia solvent zeolite mixture to the multimetalite precursors. In another embodiment, each metal species of the multimetalite is independently incorporated and calcined within the zeolite composition. For example, a single hydrated metal hydrate is introduced within the zeolite by an ammonia solvent. The resulting composite is dried and calcined and another metal salt is subsequently introduced in a similar fashion. The precursor occluded zeolite is then calcined to form a multimetalite occluded zeolite. Additional metal species may be occluded in the same zeolite by continuing this serial incorporation procedure. The composition of the resultant multimetalite occluded zeolite can be expressed with respect to its metal species by the following atomic ratio of metal species formula M1 M2 Mn Al Fr where M1, M2 and Mn each represent the number of moles the particular metal species occluded within the zeolite, and AlFr represents the number of moles of framework aluminum present in the zeolite. Where AlFr 1, M12 M2 and Mn can range anywhere from 0.1 to essentially infinity, preferably 0.5 to 1000. Examples of zeolite compositions and their corresponding atomic ratios are given in Table I. In general, suitable amounts of each metal species added to a zeolite of the present invention can vary according to the particular selectivity and activity desired in the final multimetalite occluded product. The following examples illustrate the preparation of multimetalite occluded zeolites and the use of such products as catalysts.
