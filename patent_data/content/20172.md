## Description
NEMATICIDAL HALOETHENYLTHIOPHENES The present invention relates to a method and composition for controlling nematodes and to novel nematicidal compounds. More particularly, the invention relates to dihaloethenylthiophenes useful as nematicides for agricultural crops. Dihaloethenylthiophenes are known to be useful as intermediates for the preparation of pharmaceuticals.German Offenlegungsschrift 2810262, published September 28, 1978 generically describes compounds useful for that purpose and specifically exemplifies 2 2,2 dichloroethenyl thiophene. Certain ethenylthiophenes have been reported by Handele to have nematicidal activity, for example, 1,2 di 2 thienyl ethenes and 1 phenyl 2 thienyl ethenes. See M.J. Handele, SYNTHESE, SPECTRA EN NEMATICIDE ACTIVITEIT VAN 1,2 DITHIENYLETHENEN EN 1 FENYL 2THIENYLETHENEN, Thesis, University of Utrecht, 1971.Certain dihaloethenylnitrofurans are also said to have nematicidal activity. See, for example, U.S. Patent 4,024,161, issued May 17, 1977. It has now been found that the dihaloethenylthiophenes described below are excellent nematicides for use in agricultural crops. The present invention thus provides a method and composition for controlling nematodes in agricultural crops by applying to the locus of infestation a nematicidally effective amount of a compound of the formulaEMI1.1 wherein each X is a halogen atom each R is halogen, hydrogen, lower alkyl, or nitro n is 0, 1 or 2 andR1 is hydrogen, lower alkyl, or di lower alkyl phosphate. Particularly effective as nematicides are compounds in which at least one R is other than hydrogen, especially at the 3 or 5 position of the thiophene ring, preferably nitro or lower alkyl at position 5 of the ring. Also of particular interest are compounds in which R1 is other than hydrogen. The novel compounds of this invention are those described above in which R1 is other than hydrogen or in which at least one R on the thiophene ring is nitro, advantageously at the 3 or 5 position of the thiophene ring, preferably nitro at the position 5 of the ring. Throughout the specification and claims the term lower , as applied to a hydrocarbyl radical means having 1 4 carbon atoms, and the term halogen or halo means bromine, chlorine or fluorine, preferably bromine or chlorine. The nematicides of this invention, like most agricultural chemicals, are generally not applied full strength, but are formulated with agriculturally acceptable carriers normally employed for facilitating the dispersion of active ingredients, various additives, and optionally with other active ingredients, recognizing the accepted fact that the formulation and mode of application of a toxicant may affect the activity of the material. The present compounds may be applied, for example, to the soil in which nematode control is desired as granules or powders or liquids, the choice of application varying, of course, with the nematode species and environmental factors present at the particular locus of infestation.Thus, the compounds may be formulated as granules of various sizes, as d sts, as wettable powders, as emulsifiable concentrates,1 as solutions, as dispersions, as controlled release compositions, and the like.Some of the compounds may also be applied to the exposed leaves and stems for control of soil infestations of nematodes. A typical formulation may vary widely in concentration of the active ingredient depending on the particular agent used, the additives and carriers used, other active ingredients, and the desired mode of application. With due consideration of these factors, the active ingredient of a typical formulation may, for example, be suitably present at a concentration of from about 0.5 up to about 99.5 by weight of the formulation. Substantially inactive ingredients such as adjuvants and carriers may comprise from about 99.5 by weight to as low as about 0.5 by weight of the formulation. Surface active agents, if employed in the formulation, may be present at various concentrations, suitably in the range of 1 to 30 by weight.Provided below is a general description of exemplary types of formulations which may be employed for dispersion of the nematicides of the present invention. Dusts are admixtures of the active ingredient with finely divided solid carriers and or diluents such as talc, natural clays, kieselguhr, pyrophyllite, chalk, diatomaceous earths, calcium phosphates, calcium and magnesium carbonates, sulfur, lime, flours, and other organic and inorganic solid carriers. These finely divided formulations generally have an average particle size of less than about 50 microns 325 mesh, U.S. SieveSeries ASTM E 11 61 . In most cases, the active ingredient will be present in dust formulations at a concentration in the range of 1 to 15 , and occasionally from 1 to about 30 , the balance of the composition typically being agriculturally acceptable carrier or diluent. Wettable powders, also useful formulations for these nematicides, are in the form of finely divided particles which disperse readily in water or other liquid vehicles. The wettable powder is ultimately applied to the soil or plant as a dry dust or a dispersion in water or other liquid. Typical carriers for wettable powders include fuller s earth, kaolin clays, silicas, and other highly absorbent or adsorbent inorganic diluents. The concentration of active ingredient in wettable powders is dependent upon physical properties of the active ingredient and the absorbency characteristics of the carrier.Liquids and low melting solids mp 100 C are suitably formulated in the concentration range of 5 to 50 by weight, usually from 10 to 30 high melting solids mp 100 C being formulated in the range of 5 to 95 by weight, usually 50 to 85 . An agriculturally acceptable carrier or diluent, frequently including a small amount of a surfactant to facilitate wetting dispersion and suspension, accounts for the balance of the formulation. Granules are admixtures of the active ingredients with solids of particle sizes generally in the range of 4 to 100 mesh U.S. Sieve Series . Granular formulations may employ hard core materials such as sands and other silicates, mineral carbonates, sulfates or phosphates and the like, or porous cores such as attapulgite clays, fuller s earth, kieselguhr, chalk, diatomaceous earths, ground corn cobsi wood dusts and the like. Impregnating or binding agents such as aliphatic and aromatic petroleum solvents, alcohols, ethers, ketones, esters, vegetable oils, polyvinyl acetates, polyvinyl alcohols, dextrins, sugars and the like are commonly used to aid in coating or impregnating the solid carriers with the active ingredient. Emulsifying agents, wetting agents, dispersing agents, and other additives known in the art may also be added. A typical granular formulation may suitably contain from about 1 to about 50 by weight active ingredient and 99 to 508 by weight of inert materials. Microencapsulated or other controlled release formulations may also be used with nematicides of this invention for control of nematodes. Emulsifiable concentrates EC s are homogeneous liquid compositions, usually containing the active ingredient dissolved in a liquid carrier. Commonly used liquid carriers include xylene, heavy aromatic naphthas, isophorone, and other nonvolatile or slightly volatile organic solvents. For application of the nematicide, these concentrates are dispersed in water, or other liquid vehicle, forming an emulsion, and are normally applied as a spray to the area to be treated.The concentration of the essential active ingredient in BC s may vary according to the manner in which the composition is to be applied, but, in general, is in the range of 0.5 to 95 , frequently 10 to 80 , by weight of active ingredient, with the remaining 99.5 to 5 being surfactant and liquid carrier. Flowables are similar to EC s except that the active ingredient is suspended in a liquid carrier, generally water. Flowables, like EC s, may include a small amount of a surfactant, and contain active ingredient in the range of 0.5 to 95 , frequently from 10 to 50 , by weight of the composition. For application, flowables may be diluted in water or other liquid vehicle, and are normally applied as a spray to the area to be treated. Typical wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agents used in nematicidal formulations include, but are not limited to, the alkyl and alkylaryl sulfonates and sulfates and their sodium salts alkylaryl polyether alcohols, sulfated higher alcohols polyethylene oxides sulfonated animal and vegetable oils sulfonated petroleum oils fatty acid esters of polyhydric alcohols and the ethylene oxide addition products of such esters and the addition product of long chain mercaptans and ethylene oxide. Many other types of useful surfaceactive agents are available in commerce. The surfaceactive agent, when used, normally comprises from 1 to 15 by weight of the nematicidal composition. Other useful formulations include simple solutions of the active ingredient in a relatively non volatile solvent such as corn oil, kerosene, propylene glycol, or other organic solvents. This type of formulation is particularly useful for ultra low volume application. The concentration of the nematicide in use dilution is normally in the range of about 2 to about 0.18. Many variations of spraying, dusting, soil incorporated, and controlled or slow release compositions in the art may be used by substituting or adding a compound of this invention into compositions known or apparent to the art. Nematicidal compositions may be formulated and applied with other suitable active ingredients, including other nematicides, insecticides, acaricides, fungicides, plant regulators, herbicides, fertilizers, and so forth. In applying the foregoing chemicals, an effective nematicidal amount must be applied. While the application rate will vary widely depending on the choice of compound, the formulation and mode of application, the plant species being protected and the planting density, a suitable use rate may be in the range of 0.5 to 25 kg hectare, preferably 1 to about 20 kg hectare. Trees and vines for example may require at least 5 kg hectare whereas annuals such as corn may require considerably lower rates of application, for example 1 to 5 kg hectare.

The formulation used was a standard 5 wt. dust formulation made up as follows Active ingredient 100 active basis 5 parts Base 95 parts 96 attaclay 2 highly purified sodium lignosulfonate 100 2 powdered sodium alkylnaphthalenesulfonate 75 The mixture was ground to a fine powder. Biological Tests The formulation described above was tested for activity against root knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita as follows Nematode Culture Tomato seedlings with two large true leaves were transplanted into six inch clay pots containing steam sterilized sandy soil. One week after transplanting, galled roots of nematode infested tomato plants, with fully developed egg masses, were placed in three holes in the soil around the seedling roots.Holes were then closed with soil. The plants were allowed to grow until fully developed egg masses were formed 6 to 7 weeks after inoculation . Inoculum Preparation Infected tomato roots, containing egg masses, were cleaned under running tap water, cut into short pieces and comminuted with water in an electrical blender for 30 seconds. The shredded roots were poured onto layers of washed sand in a wooden flat. The flat was covered with plastic sheeting and kept at greenhouse temperatures for 3 to 7 days to allow about 50 of the larvae to hatch. Preparation of Root Knot Nematode Infested Soil Samples of the infested soil prepared as described above were processed for nematodes by using the Caveness and Jensen centrifugal sugar flotation extraction technique Caveness, F.E. and Jensen, H.J., Modification of the Centrifugal Flotation Technique for theIsolation and Concentration of Nematodes and their Eggs from Soil and Plant Tissue, Proc. Helm. Soc., Washington, 22, 87 89 1955 . A 500 mesh sieve was used to collect the nematodes and eggs, and their number was estimated under a stereomicroscope. Enough sand containing eggs and larvae was mixed with additional steam sterilized sandy soil so that there were 600 to 800 root knot nematode larvae and eggs per pot of soil three inch diameter each, containing approximately 300 g soil .Depending on the total amount of nematode infested soil needed, mixing was accomplished by use of a cement mixer for 5 minutes or the V shaped rotary mixer for 60 seconds. Soil so infected was used for soil incorporated and systemic nematicidal studies within two days of preparation. For the soil incorporation tests the formulated compounds to be tested for nematicidal activity were incorporated in the root knot nematode infested potting soil to give soil treatment at a rate of 25 ppm. weight chemical volume soil . Young tomato plants were planted in this soil in three inch pots. At the end of two weeks the roots of all plants were examined and rated in comparison to untreated checks.For the systemic test an aqueous acetonic solution 2400 ppm was sprayed on the leaves and stems of plants planted in inoculated soil. For this test readings were taken at 1 and 7 days. The rating system used to report results is as follows Knot Index 4 No control amount of swellings equivalent to that developed on the roots of the untreated check plants.3 Amount of sellings 25 less than that developed on the roots of the untreated check plants.2 Amount of swellings 50 less than that developed on the roots of the untreated check plants.1 Amount of swellings 75 less than that developed on the roots of the untreated check plants.0 No swellings complete control. Control Treatments The untreated check plants were treated in the same manner as those treated with the active ingredient. The formulation base, without active ingredient, was added to the soil for untreated plants and separate untreated plants were used to detect the effects, if any, of chemicals in the formulation base. Each test series also included a formulation of carbofuran, a known nematicide, as a standard for comparison. Results The results of the tests are shown inTable I. High levels of activity in the soil incorporated test were exhibited by most of the exemplified compounds. One of the compounds showed excellent systemic activity and another showed some systemic control after seven days.
