# Electric arc welder that provides non sticking arc initiation and thereafter maintains the arc.

## Abstract
An electric arc welder has a current conducting means which can supply welding power to an arc along a first volt ampere curve, has a second current conducting means which can be paralleled with the first current conducting means to supply welding power to that arc along a second and distinctly different volt ampere curve, has a voltage sensing circuit which senses the arc voltage, and has a control circuit which automatically and virtually instantaneously shifts the supplying of welding power from a point on the first volt ampere curve to a point of essentially equal potential on the second and distinctly different volt ampere curve when the voltage sensing circuit senses that the arc voltage has fallen below a predtermined value. That control circuit will subse quently shift the supplying of welding power from a point on the second and distinctly different volt ampere curve to a point of essentially equal potential on the first volt ampere curve when the voltage sensing circuit senses that the arc voltage has risen above that predetermined value. In this way, a welding wire or welding rod can be continually advanced toward a weld puddle in a work piece, and the welding power which is supplied along the second and distinctly different volt ampere curve will transfer the tip of that welding wire or welding rod to that weld puddle without shorting and thereby extinguishing the arc.
