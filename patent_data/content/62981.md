# METHOD OF TREATING WATER IN OIL DISPERSIONS

## Abstract
A method of treating salt water in oil dispersions com prises mixing with the dispersion a latex of a rubber having a high wet gel strength. The incorporation of the latex into the dispersion causes exudation of water from the dispersion with resulting thickening. If sufficient latex is used the dispersion may be transformed into a solid. Suitable rubbers include natural rubber, polychloroprene rubber, butadiene acrylonitrile rubber, styrene butadiene rubber and poly methyl methacrylate graft natural rubber. The tackiness of solids formed using for example a natural rubber latex can be reduced by using in addition to the natural rubber latex, a latex of a low or zero wet gel strength polymer e.g. PVC, poly vinyl acetate or polys tyrene. The effectiveness of the method of treatment may be improved by the use of a suitable compatible solvent e.g. toluene or a filler such as a clay filler.
