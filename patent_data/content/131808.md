# Very high frequency power transformer and method of manufacturing.

## Abstract
A transformer assembly suitable for use in very high frequency VHF switching power supplies that maintains a low leakage inductance between critical transformer wind ings while complying with the physical and electrical requir ements imposed by standards for primary to secondary isola tion. The transformer includes a telescopic bobbin assembly 99, 112 with an inner 99 and an outer 112 section that telescope together to form an interior clearance space or chamber between the two sections. The interior chamber has a narrow conduit 108 exiting to the exterior of the bobbin assembly 99, 112 . Described are two embodiments for a transformer used in a forward averaging type converter and a third embodiment for a transformer used in a frequency mod ulated converter.
