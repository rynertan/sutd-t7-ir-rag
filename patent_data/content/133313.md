# Three mold hand over hand blow molding machine and method.

## Abstract
Disclosed is an improved hand over hand blow molding machine and the method for forming a chain of hollow, shaped article bodies of biaxially oriented, normally highly crystalline thermoplastic material from a tube of said material in substantially unoriented condition, but at an orientation temperature. The machine and method are characterized by an additional blow mold in tandem with one of the blow molds of the prior art two mold machine and method. The machine is operated so that each longitudinally stretched portion of the tube on which the mold pieces of each blow mold closes has substantially the same extent of longitudinal stretch or elongation. This is done by arresting the travel of the tube into the machine according to the distance of travel of the blow mold pulling it into the machine.
