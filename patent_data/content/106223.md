# ENERGY CONTROL WINDOW FILM SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR MANUFACTURING THE SAME

## Abstract
An energy control sheet, including a highly transparent substructure having first and second surfaces, a substantially transparent, thin film metal layer formed on one surface of the substructure, and a highly transparent thin film dielectric layer formed over said metal layer. The dielectric layer comprises a mixed metal oxide layer having metal consti tuents of at least one lanthanide series metal e.g. cerium oxide and at least one transition or semiconductor metal e.g. tin oxide . The dielectric layer is characterized by substantial water vapor impermeability so that the weather ability of the energy control sheet is substantially improved. The metal layer is either a silver layer or a silver palladium alloy.
