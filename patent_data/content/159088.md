# Device for removable fixing in a continuous relationship a hood onto a vehicle.

## Abstract
A device for removably fixing in a continuos relationship a hood onto a vehicle is formed by a seat of substantially G shaped cross section, formed along the rear and or side edge of the body in face of which the hood is disposed when being applied onto the vehicle, and by a flexible element formed along the perimetral rear and or side edge of the hood, whose cross section is larger than that of the opening allowing the access to said body seat into which the flexible element is extractable pressed by hand in this way, a removable continuous fixing of the hood onto the body is obtained along the entire side and rear perimeter thereof, maintaining the conventional structure of its front portion, and in addition, the removable continuous fixing of the hood is obtained by a simple pressure of its perimetral edges configured in a special manner for allowing to be coupled, in a separable manner, to corresponding configurations of the body, so as to render extremely easy the fixing and the removal of the hood.

## Description
DESCRIPTION The invention relates to a device for removably fixing in a continuous manner three sides of a hood onto a vehicle. Usually, the conventional hood is of the type which is stretched to form the roof of the vehicle and anchored to the upper structure of the windshield, by means of a hooking device which stretches it. In this known technical solution, the hoods provide their seal along the perimetral edges, against inner and outer projections of the body or by means of structures forming part of the hood itself. It is an object of the invention to provide a type of a removable continuous fixing of the hood to the body, along its entire side and rear perimeter, keeping the conventional configuration of its front portion. Another object of the invention is to allow carrying out the removable continuous fixing of the hood by a simple pressure of its perimetral edges configured in a special manner for being coupled, in a separable fashion, to corresponding configurations of the body, so as to render extremely easy the fixing and the removal of the hood. For these and further objects, which will be better ubderstood from the following description, the invention provides a device for the removable continuous fixing of hoods on vehicles, characterized in being formed by a seat of substantially G shaped cross section, formed along the rear and or side edge of the body in face of which the hood is disposed when being applied on the vehicle, and by a flexible element formed along the perimetral rear and or side edge of the hood, having a cross section larger than that of the opening forming the access to said seat of the body into which the flexible element is extractably pressed by hand. The device according to the invention will now be described with reference to the annexed drawings, in which Figure 1 is a view, given by way of example, illustrating the way of manually installing a hood by means of the removable continuous fixing according to the invention, Figure 2 is a cross sectional view along the line II II ofFig. 1. The section of the body along which the hood 10 is fixed in accordance with the invention identifies e G shaped seat 11 obtained by joining two elements forming part of the structure of the vehicle Fig. 2 . The element 12, fcrmed by an outer portion 12a and by bent orthogonal branches 12b, 12c and 12d, is joined to the element 13 formed by orthogonal branches 13a and 13b. Along the branches 12d and 13a the connection between the two elements 12 and 13 is provided. Thus, as can be seen still in Fig. 2, the G shaped seat 11 is identified by the branches 12b, 12c and 12d of the element 12 and by the branch 13b of the element 13. The hood 10 is provided, along its perimetral side and rear edges, with a flexible element 14, for example a solid pipe made of rubber, contained in a sewn flap 15, tubular in shape, of the edge of the hood sheet. On installing the hood see Fig. 1 , its perimetral edge comprising the flexible element 14, is progressively pressed into the G shaped seat 11 by compulsorily passing the access bottleneck formed between the branches 12a and 13b and whose width is smaller than the diameter of flexible element 14. Only a manual action will permit the extraction of the element 14 from the G shaped seat 11 when the removal of the hood is required in fact, during the forward movement, the aerodynamic action stretches the sheet of hood 10, thus aiding in the provision of an optimum seal of the element 14 within the seat 11, without, however, that the element 14 may come out from the seat itself. The branch 13b of the elemert 13, besidesvacting to partially cbstruct the G shaped est 11, thereby locking in it the element 14, allows also to register the outer thread 16 of the sheet of the hood 10. Furthermore, it is to be noted that the portion 20 of the branch 12b, which is external with respect to the contact point with the flap 155 and the section 18 of the flap 15 itself, which extends between the said contact point and the seam 17, provide a channel 19 which serves as a passage and a discharge of the water, thus eliminating the use of the gaskets usually provided for this purpose. Figure 1 shows a hood 10 fixed not only laterally, but also rearwardly, by means of the fixing method described hereinabove, and consequently removable in its integrality after having been bent. but it is understood that the fixing device according to the invention may also extend only along the side edges, while rearwardly the hood may be steadily fixed to the body, so as to be simply bent on this latter, and not removed completely.
