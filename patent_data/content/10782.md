# Method and apparatus for severing optical fibers.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for cutting an optical fiber 20 along a plane that is either oblique or perpendicular to its axis 29 . In principle, a predetermined portion of a fiber is held between a fixed holding fixture 22, 23 and a driven retaining fixture 30 . The driven fixture 30 is adapted to travel in an orbiting, spiraling path. A cutting device 26 is mounted adjacent to the fiber portion and between the fixed 22, 23 and driven 30 fixtures. Upon activation, the driven fixture 30 orbits in a spiraling path and successively, the fiber 20 will contact the cutting edge 27 of the cutting device 26 when the radius of the traveled orbit is equal to the radius of the cutting edge 27 . This contact with the cutting edge 27 causes the fiber 20 to be scribed circumferentially in a plane either oblique or perpendicular to its axis 29 depending on the mounting angle of the cutting device 26 . Further spiraling of the driven fixture 30 bends the fiber 20 at the scribe and causes the fiber 20 to snap or break in the plane of the scribe mark.
