# FRACTURE FIXATION ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
A fracture fixation assembly comprises a fracture plate 10 and location members 22, each of which includes a locating portion 16 and a clamp portion 17. The locating portion is provided with a hole for receiving means, such as a screw 19, for attaching the location device to the bone with the clamping portion of the location member holding the plate against the bone. The fracture plate is devoid of holes and the location members may be such as to allow or prevent relative axial movement between the plate and the location members.
