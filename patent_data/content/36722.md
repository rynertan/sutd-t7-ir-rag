# Electromagnetic horn.

## Abstract
An electromagnetic horn has a diaphragm 11 , tone disc 29 , spacer 30 and mass 31 which are clamped together between an abutment shoulder 34 and an annular rib 35 on an internally screw threaded sleeve 33 , the annular rib 35 being produced by deformation of the sleeve after the afore said parts have been mounted on the latter. A screw threaded rod 37 extruding from the armature 12 is engaged in the sleeve 33 . Tuning of the horn can be effected by rotation of the rod 37 without the need either to release and then retight en any locknuts or to deform the body 10 . For ease of assembly of a contact breaker assembly 14 into the horn body 10 , a first arm 40 carrying a first contact 47 is mounted at one of its ends in the body 10 . A second arm 48 carrying a second contact 49 is mounted on the first arm 40 but is electrically insulated therefrom. The second arm has an extension 53 abutting a contact stud 54 fixed in the body 10 . An adjuster 46 is engaged with the other end of the first arm 40 . The second arm 48 can be assembled and the first arm 40 before securing of the assembly in the body 10 .
