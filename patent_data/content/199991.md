# Fluoropolymer alloys, their preparation and application.

## Abstract
This invention relates to fluoropolymer alloys made of melt fabricatable extra high molecular weight fluorlnated ethylene propylene copolymer EHMW FEP and one or more other polymers. In fluoropolymer alloys made of EHMW FEP and polytetrafluoroethylene, weight percentage of the former is 0.1 99.9 and the latter is 99.9 0.1 . The processes for preparing fluoropolymer alloys are blend of dried powder co mill or wetted powder co mill. Using the fluoropolymer alloys of this invention, various kinds of articles have been fabricates by melt compression or cold compaction and sintering. These properly fabricated arti cales show a great improvement in creep property and also a prolonged service life in comparision with those made from ordinary polytetrafluoroethylene.
