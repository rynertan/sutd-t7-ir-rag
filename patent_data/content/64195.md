# Automatic control of the length of a row of articles to be injection molded.

## Abstract
A method of automatically controlling the length of a row of articles to be injection molded on a multi cavity mold 11,12 having an elongate runner 14 and a plurality of successive cavities 13 spaced equidistantly along the runner 14 , comprising the steps of detecting an initial position of a control rod 20 inserted in the runner 14 registering both the direction and the extent to which the control rod 20 is to be moved for longitudinal adjustment with respect to the runner 14 , depending on the initial position of the control rod 20 and a preselected length of the article row to be molded moving the control rod 20 longitudinally of the runner in the registered direction detecting the movement of the control rod 20 to the registered extend and in response to the last named detecting, terminating the movement of the control rod 20 . An apparatus 10 for carrying out this method is also disclosed.
