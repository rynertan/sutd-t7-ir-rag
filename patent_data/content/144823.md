# Method of fabricating a lateral PNP transistor.

## Abstract
A method for making a lateral PNP transistor simul taneously with an NPN transistor and the resultant device wherein a first mask 76 defines a base width by the resistor implant 78, 80 for a P type resistor and a second mask 86 is overlaid asymmetricially on said first mask to partially cover the collector 80 . At the same time that the NPN extrinsic base contact is made, P type dopants are intro duced in the areas 88, 89 exposed by the first and second masks to provide an emitter 92 and a collector contact 94 for the PNP transistor, said transistor thus featuring a graded collector 96, 94 with a high punch through voltage.
