# BEVERAGE PROCESS AND COMPOSITIONS

## Abstract
Process for making a beverage or ingredient therefor comprises forming an alcoholic solution of at least one flavoured component comprising alcohol soluble oil, e.g. citrus fruit oil, diluting the alcoholic solution with water or water alcohol mixture to form an emulsion which is then filtered through a filter system to separate the emulsion and the filtrate collected. The process is especially applicable to naturally occur ring flavoured substances, preferably in the form of an alcohol extracted oil and flavour transfer to an aqueous alcoholic medium can be more efficient than counter current extraction or tincture techniques.
