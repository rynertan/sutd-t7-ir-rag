# Anti skid device.

## Abstract
Anti skid device of a kind that includes a chain provided pulley that on use is brought to contact with the side of the vehicle wheel so that when the vehicle wheel is rotated the chain pieces 2 are successively thrown in between wheel and ground in order to improve the traction. The anti skid device is rotatably journaled in an arm 7 that in turn is fastened to a housing 8 that is turnably journaled on a stub axle 9 . The turning movement of the arm and the housing is achieved in one direction by a bowden wire 20 and in the other direction by a return spring 23 . The stub axle 9 of the housing 8 is fastened to a plate 10 that in turn is fastened to a tube 11 by means of welding. The tube 11 is in turn arranged in clamps 12 and 13 , that in turn are fastened to the bolts holding together the vehicle axle and its spring. Since the fastening tube 11 is held in clamps 12 and 13 the device according to the invention can be displaced lengthwise of the vehicle as well as it can be given different movement paths between parking and working position by turning the tube 11 in the clamps 13 . In this way a step by step adjustment of the working position of the device is possible and thereafter the best movement path between the two positions can be choosen.
