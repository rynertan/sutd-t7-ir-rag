# Pelletizing apparatus.

## Abstract
Apparatus 1 for pelletizing finely divided particulate materials comprises a generally vertically oriented housing 2 having an inlet at the upper end and an outlet at the lower end, and a plurality of half catenary shaped baffles 3 fixedly mounted in the housing 2 along the vertical axis thereof at spaced apart successively lower elevations, the baffles 3 being spaced apart in a direction transverse to the vertical axis of the apparatus and arranged such that i the concave surface of the baffles alternately face in opposing direction toward the center of the housing 2 , and ii the exit lip of each succeeding baffle 3 extends beyond the vertical plane of the exit lip of the preceding baffle 3 to define a cascading and alternately reversing flow path along the vertical axis of the apparatus.
