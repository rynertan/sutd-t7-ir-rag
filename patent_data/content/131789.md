## Description
The present invention was wholly or partially made with funds provided by the National Cancer Institute underGrant No. CA 08748. Accordingly, the United StatesGovernment has certain rights in this invention. This invention relates to a method of treating human cancer in humans using purified human tumor necrosis factor hTNF alone, or hTNF in conjunction with human interferon hIFN . A method for producing hTNF is described. Background TNF The history of tumor necrosis factor TNF begins more than a century ago with the finding that during certain bacterial infections in humans, there was a concomittant regression of any human tumors present in vivo. For over 40 years, Coley and others treated human malignancies with bacterial cell free filtrates or mixed bacterial vaccines often times with positive results. Studies in guinea pigs and mice were done as well.The antitumor effect in experimental animals is a severe hemorrhagic reaction at the core of the tumor within 4 hrs of bacterial administration to a test subject or animal.This is followed by a slower necrotizing effect which exhibits a growing intensity over the next 48 hours. The tumor mass undergoes a progressive darkening in color indicative death and hemorrhage leading in many instances to complete tumor regression. This striking hemorrhagic necrosis induced in certain experimental tumors by gram negative bacteria or by endotoxin lipopolysaccharide derived from their cell wall has long been considered as the experimental counterpart of the clinical observations described above. However, work at Sloan Kettering led to the conclusion that bacterial stimulation causes release of a factor, possibly of macrophage origin, that is itself directly or indirectly responsible for tumor cell killing.Evidence for this comes from work showing that the serum ofBCG infected mice injected with endotoxin causes hemorrhagic necrosis of transplanted sarcoma Meth A and other tumorsSerum from BCG injected mice or serum from normal mice given endotoxin is inactive. Endotoxin alone lacks toxicity for most tumor cells in vitro. This active serum component has been called tumor necrosis factor TNF . TNF activity cannot be ascribed to residual endotoxin as measured by pyrogenicity, Limulus testing and chemical analysis for endotoxin moieties. TNF, unlike endotoxin, is directly cytotoxic for certain tumor cells in vitro cultured cells from normal sources remain uninjured LloydJ. Old, New Developments in Cancer Therapy, MSKCC ClinicalBulletin 6 118 1976 , E.A. Carswell et al Proc. Nat l. Acad. Sci. USA 72 3666 70 Sept 19751.Other rodents, i.e.rats and rabbits, produce TNF as well, with BCG plus endotoxin administration. TNF was first found in the serum of mice primed with Bacillus Calmette GuFrin BCG , and challenged 2 3 weeks later with endotoxin from E. Coli.Neither BCG or its counterparts see below , nor endotoxin alone produces the TNF factor in mouse serum both must be present. C. granulosum, C Parvum, malaria or Zymosan yeast cell walls , which like BCG, induce massive hyperplasia of macrophage and other cellular elements of the reticuloendothelial system can substitute for BCG in priming mice for release of TNF. These factors are BCG counterparts. The serum derived after BCG and endotoxin treatment is atypical in that it does not completely clot.A protocol for optimal production and assay of TNF in mice includes a BCG an inoculum of 2x107 viable BCG organisms for maximal stimulation and hyperplasia of the reticulo endothelial RES system, b endotoxin 14 21 days later, at height of RES stimulation by BCG, 0.25 25 microgram inoculum of endotoxin lipopolysaccharide w from E. Coli . The highest dose gives the best TNF levels in mice, c TNF collection The optimal time is 2 hr post endotoxin administration later times less efficient due to circulatory collapse produced by shock , and d TNF assays 1 In Vivo The necrotic effect of TNF positive mouse serum on BALb c Meth A ascites Sarcoma transplanted into BAlbic x C57 BL 6 F1 hybrid is demonstrated in the following way.After 7 days the effect of TNF positive serum on subcutaneous transplant tumor in vivo is scored visually within 24 hr. A reaction is first seen in 3 4 hours. In 7 day transplants, the necrotic response generally corresponds with the volume of TNF positive serum administered from about 0.1 0.5 ml. reaction shows that the tumor mass has been completely or almost completely destroyed leaving only a peripheral rim of apparently viable tumor tissue. 6 day transplants are less responsive, 5 day transplants not at all responsive. 2 In Vitro TNF sensitive L M cells were derived from cloned mouse CL929 cells.deposited at the American Type Cul there Collection ATCC under the deposit number L 929. A TNF 1 resistant line of L cells was derived bv repeated passage of the TNF sensitive L cells in media containing TNF. TNF is cytotoxic for TNF sensitive L cells tL S but not for TNF resistant L cells L R . The assay is done using 0.5 ml of medium containing serial dilutions of TNF added to wells 24 well Costar plates seeded 2 3 hours previously with 50,000 typsinized L cells in 0.5 ml Eagle s minimal essential medium and determining the the amount of protein that resulted in 50 cell kill, estimated at 48 hours by phase microscopy or.trypan blue exclusion. For example, for one stand ard batch 1 unit in vitro partially purified mouse TNF is equal to 58 ng or a specificactivity of 20,000 units mg protein. This partially purified mouse TNF contains no IFN. The original serum before purification has some Interferon IFN . Besides BCG,,C. granulosum, C. Parvum, Malaria orZymosan yeast cell wall can also be used as priming agents. Green et al., J. Nat l. Cancer Inst. 59 1519 1977 report mice reach a maximum hypersensitivity to endotoxin six days post C. Parvum injection. In that method endotoxin administration begins 4 days after C. Parvum. Endotoxin doses are as little as 0.25 micro grams but 25 micrograms are used to elicite TNF release. TNF release is maximal 90 minutes after intravenous injection of 1 microgram of endotoxin. TNF production varies with different mouse stains. Endotoxin from any gram negative bacterium such as E.Coli is the most efficient agent found to date to releaseTNF in vivo. Carswell et al, Supra The effect of TNF is seen in a variety of tumor mouse systems, namely SarcomasS 180 CD 1 Swiss , BP8 C3H Leukemias EL4 C57Bl 6 , ASL1 A Strain , RADA 1 A Strain , RLol BALB c , and mastocytoma Psis DBA 2 . Meth A is highly sensitive to TNF when the tumor is injected intradermally as in the in vivo assay. Tumors with lesser response were also reported reticulum cell sarcoma RCS5 SJL was resistant, Mammary tumors of C3H An.x .1 Fi were only minima lly responsive andAKR spontaneous leukemias were of intermediate sensitivity. Thus mouse TNF clearly has a therapeutic effect on mouse tumors. Carswell et al, Supra . In vitro, transformed marine fibroblasts L cells in culture were most sensitive to TNF as compared to Meth A sarcoma cells or mouse embryo fibroblasts MEF . Viable cells are counted after 48 hour exposure to TNF. The effect here is ytotoxic as well as cytostatic, but delayed, since it is not seen for the first 16 hours. The effect in theMeth A in vivo test is a necrosis process which begins in the centre of the Meth A tumor spreading outward leaving a rim of seemingly unaffected tumor tissue. The tumor can then begin to grow again from this residuum.Treatment with an optimal dose of TNF will cause complete regression in a good percent of the animals so treated. TheL cell effect is the basis for the in vitro assay, Supra. A resistant line of L cells has been developed as well, derived by repeated passage of TNF sensitive L cells in media containing TNF. TNF is cytotoxic for sensitiveL cells L s l but not for resistant L cells L R . These assays are also used for assay of hTNF below . Indirect indications so far point to macrophages as being one cell source of TNF in mice and rabbits since liver and spleen macrophages undergo massive hyperplasia when under the influence of BCG or its counterparts plus endotoxin. In sum then 1 agents which prime for TNF release cause marked macrophage hyperplasia 2 selective lysis of splenic macrophages is seen shortly after endotoxin injection intoBCG primed mice 3 serum containing TNF is rich in enzymes of lysosomal origin and activated macrophages are characteristically rich in such lysosomes. Cloned lines of mouse histiocytomas J774 and PU5 1.8 produce TNF constitutively which production is greatly increased after exposure to endotoxin. channel et al 1980 Infect. Immun. 30, 523 530, and Williamson et al unpublished . As isolated from serum, mouse TNF is a glycoprotein which exists in at least two forms, a 40 60,000 and a 150,000 molecular weight form. Mannel et al 1980 Infect.Immun. 28, 204 211 Kull et al. 1981 J. Immunol. 126, 1279 83 Haranaka, K. et al., 1981 Jpn J. Exp. Med., 51, 191 194 Green, S. et al. 1976 Proc. Nat l. Acad. Sci. USA 73, 381 385 and unpublished . TNF is stable when frozen, preferably below 700C. Its activity is destroyed at 700C for 30 min. It is pyrogenic in rabbits in a range from 5 500 microgras kg and non pyrogenic at 5 microgram kg.Rabbit TNF has been reported to have a molecular weight range of approximately 39 68 k daltons.

Med. 160, 354 358 Interferon Proteinaceous interferon is produced by host animals as a result of a previous virus infection. The host interferon produced protects the animal against a subsequent viral infection. IFN has been shown to play an important role in the jitimunoregulatory system. Interferon has been found to effect the following cell functions It inhibits cell division, tumor growth, antibody formation, erythroid differentiation, and adipocytes differentiation while enhancing macrophage phagocytosis, lymphocyte toxicity, NK cell activity, cell surface antigen expression and antibody production. Interferon IFN has recently been found to be a possible anti cancer agent as well. There are three main interferon types namely alpha, beta and gamma, distinguished by their antigenic and biochemical properties. Alpha is secreted by leukocyte white blood cells, beta by fibroblasts and both of these can be virally induced0Gaznma IFN is secreted by lymphoid cells and is known as immune interferon. Stewart, W.E. II, et al., Nature 286, 110 1980 1 Major antigenic differences form the primary basis for differentiation among the threeIFN species. In addition, the IFNs differ in a number of biological and physicochemical properties. Human alpha and beta IFN have been purified and their amino acid sequences have been determined partly by direct amino acid sequencing Knight, E.Jr., et al., Science 207, 525 526 1980 Zoon,K.C., Science 207, 527 528 1980 1 and more completely by analysis of the cloned complementary DNA sequences tMantei, N., et al. Gene 10, 1 10 1980 Taniguchi, T., et al.,Gene 10, 11 15 1980 1. Comparison of cloned alpha and beta IFN DNA sequences indicated only 29 homology between the two IFNs at the amino acid level Taniguichi, T.,Mantei, N., et al., Nature 285, 547 549 980 1. Within each of the three major IFN species there may be molecular subspecies with a lesser degree of heterogeneity.Several subspecies of human alpha IFN have been recognized so far by comparison of cloned DNA sequences. Nagata, S., et al.,Nature 287 401 408 1980 1. Much less information is available about gamma IFN.This IFN is usually found in supernatants of lymphocyte cultures exposed to mitogens such as various lectins or specific antigens in cultures of sensitized cells. The definition of gamma IFN rests on two major criteria i unlike alpha and beta IFN, the biological activity of gzmma IFN is largely destroyed by exposure to pH 2, and ii antisera prepared against alpha and and beta IFN do not cross react with gamma IFN. In addition, experiments carried out with relatively crude preparations of gamma IFN suggest a number of biological differences. For example, gamma IFN was shown to induce the antivsral state much more slowly than alpha or beta IFN Dianzani, F ., et al., Nature 283, 400 402 1980 .In contrast, gamma IFN might be more active as a cell growth inhibitory and anti tumor agent Crane, J.L. Jr., et al., J. Nat. Cancer Insti. 61 871 874 1973 Gupta et al, Proc. Nat l. Acad. Sci. U.S.A, 76, 4817 1979 Blalock et al, Cellular Immunology 49 390 394 1980 . Clinical trials of IFN for cancer therapy had been hindered because not enough could be produced. Genetic engineering techniques have surmounted this problem and theNational Cancer Institute is conducting large scale trials of human interferon hIFN . Thus both natural and recombinant hIFNs are known and used clinically. Summary The present invention reveals a process for the production and purification of human TNF hTNF for the first time. Such a process would be useful for clinical trials. Over 30 human cell lines in tissue culture are screened for their ability to produce TNF. Phorbol 12 myristate, 13 acetate PMA is also found to be necessary to enhance hTNF production. PMA is known as a tumor promoting agent. B cell lines with or without PMA are the most promising sources for hTNF production, at the present time. The standard TNF assays described above are used to assay Bor hTNF i.e. the in vivo assay for tumor necrosis and the in vitro assay for L cell cytostasis cytotoxicity. T cells, monocyte, and promylocyte cell lines produce little or no TNF.Neither exogenous BCG, nor exogenous endotoxin, are necessary for hTNF production by this method. A surprising synergistic anti tumor cell effect is found when hTNF and either recombinant or natural hIFN are used together to kill or inhibit human tumor cells. hIFN or hTNF exhibit an anti tumor effect individually, but the effect of hTNF used together with hIFN is greater than the sum of their separate anti tumor effects. Description The present invention finds that human cell lines can serve as the source of hTNF. Methods of production of mouseTNF seem to be mostly dependent on the effects of BCG and endotoxin. The present method of production from humanB cells produces TNF without added BCG or endotoxin. Thus, this TNF is essentially free of exogenous endotoxin, bacterial, and as well as serum contaminants. As shown inTable I, of the hematopoietic cells tested, B cells are the best producers of TNF. High levels of TNF production without the presence of either exogenous BCG or exogenous endotoxin is an unexpected result. Small or trace amounts of hTNF are found in supernatants of cell lines of T cell, monocyte or pro myelocytic origin. The in vitro L cell assay Carswell et al, Supra determined levels of TNF produced by cells of human origin.Thus for the first time, levels of TNF found in this study are free of any exogenous endotoxin contamination since there is no endotoxin addition to the culture system as described below. Previous studies by others in the mouse find the presence of endotoxin a problem as it can be difficult to free a system of endotoxin. EBV transformed B cell lines are derived from patients with melanoma. Other cell lines are from cell bank collections of Dr. Lloyd Old, Dr. Jorgen E. Fogh or Dr.Peter Ralph of Sloan Kettering Institute. LukIl cells are obtained from Dr. W. Stewart Pickering et al 1980 Proc.Nat l. Acad. Sci. USA 77, 5938 5942 . EBV transformed B cell lines are derived from patients with melanoma Houghton et al, Proc. Nat l. Acad. Sci. USA, 77 4260 1980 . In screening human cells of hematopoietic origin forTNF production, see Table I 5 x 105 cells per ml are cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 8 fetal calf serum FCS with and without PMA 10 ng ml Sigma Chemical Co., St.Louis, Mo . Table 2 shows the composition of RPMI 1640.After incubation for 48 hrs at 370C, the cells are collected by centrifugation and resuspended at 1 x 106 per ml inRPMI 1640 medium without PMA for another 48 hrs. Cell free supernatants are collected by centrifugation of the cell cultures. These supernatants are frozen at 200C before TNF activity is determined by the L cell assay used on supernatants diluted by one half. In the in vitro assay, mouse L M cells derived from theNCTC clone 929 L line were obtained from the American TypeCulture Collection ATCC and grown in Eagle s MinimumEssential Medium MEM GIBCO, Grand Island, N.Y. supplemented with nonessential amino acids, penicillin 100 Ulmi , streptomycin 100 g ml and 8 heat inactivated fetal calf serum, at 370C. A mouse TNF resistant L cell line L R was derived from sensitive L cells L S by repeated passages in mouse TNF containing medium.The activity of hTNF is assayed by adding equal volumes of medium such as 0.5 ml containing serial dilutions of TNF to wells 24 well Costar plates seeded three hours previously with 50,000 trypsinized L cells in 0.5 ml of medium , and determining the amount of protein that results in 50 cell kill estimated at 48 hours by phase microscopy, or trypan blue exclusion. As seen in Table I, hTNF as produced by human B cells is cytotoxic for mouse L S cells but not mouse L R cells in the standard mouse TNF in vitro assay as described above. Cells to be screened for hTNF are grown with and without tumor growth promoting agent. PMA, for example, is effective in enhancing several fold the hTNF response of B cells as shown in the L S columns of Table I see column heading no PMA . PMA is also known as TPA. PMA Cultured mouse L M cells derived from L 929 ATCC made resistant to hTNF by repeated passage in medium containing hTNF 2 3 microgram every week continuously to about 106 cells are also completely cross resistant to mouse TNF. This is an interesting cross resistance effect. To assay for hTNF In Vivo, BALB c x C57BL F mice 61 Jackson Labs , injected intradermally 7 days earlier with 5 x 105 Meth A sarcoma cells, receive a single intravenous dose of hTNF. After 24 hr, tumor hemorrhagic necrosis is graded as no effect , slight , moderate , or extensive , the latter involving 90 of the tumor surface see Carswell Supra . Thus hTNF shows a similar effect on standard TNF assays in vivo and in vitro, though in general hTNF has a higher specific activity on human cell targets as compared to mouse TNF. Endotoxin is determined by Limulus Amebocyte Lysate Microbiological Associates Since cloned lines of mouse histiocytes produce TNF, further studies of normal and malignant human histiocytes obviously must be done to determine production of hTNF by these cells in humans. The examples of B cells from Table I suggest normal B cells have this capacity as well. Example of Preparation and Concentration of hTNF from LukII Cells . 5 x 105 LukII cells ml are cultured inRPMI 1640 containing 5 FCS and 10 ng ml PMA and incubated for 48 hr. at 370C. At 48 hr, cells are collected by centrifugation and resuspended at 8 10 x 105 ml in serum free R ITS PREMIX insulin 5 micrograms ml ,Transferrin 5 micrograms ml , selenum 5ng ml serum substitute Collaborative Research, Waltham Mass and 2 nM ethanolamine and incubated an additional 48 hr.Supernatants are spun free of cells and frozen at 200C.LukII supernatants are concentrated by Amicon stirred cells PM 10 membrane , and applied to a DEAE Sephadex A 50 column 40 x 2.6 cm equilibrated with Tris 0.05M, NaC1 0.15 M buffer, pH 7.3 at 50C. 5 ml fractions are eluted with the same buffer. TNF activity is detected in the initial flow through fractions and such peak fractions are pooled. This procedure results in a 25 fold increase in specific activity 2 5 x 104 units mg protein . hTNF active fractions as determined by the L cell in vitro assay are pooled and concentrated by Amicon cells. The specific activity of the pooled fractions of hTNF is in the approximate range of 1x103 1x104 in the case of cells grown in media supplemented with fetal calf serum FCS . The specific activity of the pooled fractions of hTNF is in the approximate range of 2 5x104 micrograms in the case of cells grown in serum free media. I.V. injection of DEAE fractionated hTNF caused hemorrhagic necrosis of Meth A tumors by the in vivo test,Supra. 300 micrograms produced necrosis in 1 5 of the mice and necrosis in the remaining 4 5. 150 microgram of hTNF produced necrosis in 5 7 of the mice and necrosis in 2 7 of the mice. 75 micrograms of hTNF produced necrosis in 1 5 of the mice and necrosis in 4 5 mice. No necrosis is observed in three out of three 3 3 control mice following injection of comparable DEAE fractions of culture medium RPMI 1640 . Thus hTNF is fully active in vivo and in vitro in standard tests used to determine TNF activity. Whether grown with or without FCS, the molecular weight of hTNF is approximately 70,000 daltons as determined onSephacryl S 200 column chromatography. Righ or low pH over for example, 12 hrs., destroys the activity of hTNF e.g.approximately 90 loss of activity at pH 2.0, 55 activity is destroyed dt pH 4.0, and approximately 45 loss at pH 10.Activity of hTNF is stable in the pH range of approximately 6 8. As to heat stability, hTNF activity is destroyed by exposure to 700C for 60 min. but is stable at 560C for 60 min. Activity is preserved even after long periods of storage at 780C or 200C. IFN activity of 100 units per ml is found in the unfractionated supernatant from PMA stimulated LUKII cells.No interferon activity is detected in the pooled fractions of purified hTNF derived by DEAE chromatography, nor in the purified mouse TNF used. Human interferon activity is measured by inhibition of the cytopathic effect of vesicular stomatis virus on WISH or GM 2767 cells Stewart W.E. II 1979 The Interferon System Springer, Vienna and compared against an international standard in the case of recombinant human alpha IFN Roffman La Roche and the laboratory standard in the case of human natural gamma IFN.Recombinant alpha hIFN 2.4 x 108 units mg protein is obtained from Hoffman La Roche, natural alpha hIFN lenkocyte derived 0.64 x 106 units mg protein is prepared for the Sloan Kettering Institute evaluation program by the Kocher Laboratory, Berne Switzerland, natural beta hIFN lx107 units mg protein is obtained from RoswellPark Memorial Institute RPMI and natural gamma hIFN leukocyte derived 1x107 units mg protein is obtained from Dr. Berish Rubin, Sloan Kettering Institute. Neither mouse nor human TNF as partially purified have detectableIFN activity. The various hIFNs lack detectable hTNF activity as shown by lack of cytotoxicity or cytostasis onL S cells in the in vitro assay, Supra. The hTNF produced has different effects on different cell lines as shown in Table 3. Cytotoxicity is noted using a 35 or greater reduction in cell viability after seven days while cytostasis is noted using a 35 or greater reduction in cell number after seven days. For this study and for all further studies as shown in this description hTNF as produced by the LUKII cell line as described above is used. This specific set of examples is for reference purposes only, and is not meant to limit the invention.Other B cell line hTNF, as well as TNF from other cell sources in humans, can obviously be used on a variety of human cells in vivo and in vitro. It will be obvious to those skilled in the art to see the effect of BCG and its counterparts as well as endotoxin on the TNF production of human cells in vitro and in vivo. The effect of hTNF on human breast cell lines Tables 3 4 is similar to that of mouse TNF since both it are cytotoxic for a majority of the cell lines of breast cancer origin tested. Lung and melanoma cells are also affected by hTNF but here the predominant effect is cytostatic. Of the four normal cell lines tested with hTNF, lung, kidney, fetal lung and fetal skin, none are sensitive to hTNF. Therefore, the cytotoxic, cytostatic or hemorrhagic necrosis effect of hTNF on human cells appears to be confined to human tumor cells. hTNF has a higher specific activity on human cell targets as compared to mouse TNF. Human interferon, whether recombinant or natural, whether alpha, beta or gamma, has an inhibitory effect on tumor cell growth as is well known and, as shown here, by example for four tumor cell lines Tables 5, 6 and 9. In general, the number of anti viral units of IFN required to cause a 35 or greater cytotoxic or cytostatic effect is higher with alpha hIFN than with beta or gamma hIFN. None of the IFN preparations showed cytotoxicity or cytostasis onL S mouse cells in vitro, thereby indicating absence of hTNF activity. Yet these two cellular products when purified and used together, exhibit an effect greater than the sum of their separate effects as seen in the examples shown in tables 7 and 8. The combined cytotoxic effect ofIFN and hTNF is found also to be synergistic by the method suggested by Clarke Clark, D.A. 1958 Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci.76 915 921 i.e. pharmacologically synergistic. See Tables 10, 11 and 12. This unexpected result can be of enormous value in treating human tumors. An example of a method used to exhibit the effect of hTNF, hIFN or a combination of the two follows. Cells are trypsinized, rinsed twice, plated at 4 5 x 104 well 24 wellCostar plates in MEM containing 8 FCS and incubated at 370C. After 16 24 hr, the medium is aspirated and 1 ml dilution of either DEAE fractionated hTNF, or IFN, or hTNF plus IFN is then added. Total cell counts viable and non viable are determined at 3, 5 and 7 days by phase microscopy. Cultures are refed on day 5 with fresh medium containing the same concentrations of hTNF and or hIFN. This method is used for the results in Tables 3 9. The protocol according to Clark, Supra to screen for drug synergism or potentiation is to test two factors, X and Y herein hIFN X and hTNF Y alone and in combination.Enhanced tumor inhibition or cell toxicity leads to trials of kx kY or herein, k hIFN k hTNF to see if this quarter dose combination is comparable to the full dose of either alone and if it is, synergism of the two factors X and Y, herein hIFN and hTNF is demonstrated. This we see inTables 10, 11 and 12 wherein the same method as for table examples 4 8 is used at days 3 and 5 only. Clearly, synergism is shown at v hIFN k hTNF which effect is greater than either TNF alone or hIFN alone for the three cell lines in tables 10, 11 and 12. Thus the two, hTNF and hIFN, can be used above or cogather in various combinations to treat human tumors and cancer since they elicit a greater cytotoxic activity on lancer together than either one alone. Indeed, it is obvious that to obtain maximal therapeutic effect, cancer patients should be stimulated to produce both TNF and or i47N, or treated with varying combinations of the above therapeutic species TNF and IFN , perhaps alternating them or maximal benefit, or using different timed sequences etc. IL other factors such as TNF are necessary for maximal IFN action, supply of this deficiency can lead to enhanced IFN activity against cancer. IFN augmented action may be due to nTNF functioning as a biological response modifier of the immune system. It is then obvious to those skilled in the art to try hIFN action against human cancer cells in conjunction with other biological response modifiers alone or in combination, such as hormones, or other immune response modifier molecules which are hormone like, such asIL 2, or other cytokines, or lymphokines, or lymphotoxin.Indeed testing varying combinations of the different IFNs and such molecules against cancer is indicated. To these methods can be added testing of hTNF or hIFN from different cell sources against cancer.
