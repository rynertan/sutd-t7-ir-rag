# Optical instrument structure.

## Abstract
Rigid supporting structures for the components of high precision optical instruments, such as interferometers or monochromators, have hitherto been based on massive castings. Such castings suffer from residual non recoverable changes of shape during temperature cycling, due to the differential temperatures set up in the castings. The inven tion provides a rigid structure assembled from a number of flat sheet structural elements 51,52,57,64. Each sheet ele ment is substantially rigid in its own plane and is attached to one or more other sheets at points of contact which are such that the edge of one sheet bears against the surface of another sheet, the planes of the two sheets being perpendi cular in the region of the points of contact. An open ended rectangular box structure 50 may be assembled from two sheets 51,52, each with a single right angled fold. Each point of contact and attachment may be formed as a foot 53,54,55,56,58,59,77,62,63,80 standing proud from the re mainder of the sheet edge.
