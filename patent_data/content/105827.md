# GAS TRANSPORTING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A first gas produced or supplied at a first location is reacted combined with a selected reactant in a reversible chemical reaction to produce a gaseous reaction product which is converted to liquid form and conveyed, as a liquid, to a second location remote from the first location, whereup on it is converted back to its original gaseous constituents in a chemical reaction the reverse of the initial reaction. The regenerated first gas, now at the second location, is sepa rated from the regenerated reactant which is returned to the first location to be used again.
