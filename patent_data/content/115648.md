# Snowshoes.

## Abstract
Devices which can be attached to a persons feet to enable him to walk on thick snow layers, ice and smelted icewater. Each device comprises a lightweight floatable member two gliders per shoe 6, 7 with foot attaching means on the upper surface, front valve or flaps 3 means on the front lower surface, and rearflaps 4 means on the lower surface to resist backward propulsion.

## Claims
1. Snow shoes made of light syntetic material e.g a.b.s or polyester form within which foam is introduced and whose weight not exceed 3.5 KG. 2. The dimensions of such shoes are IMIOx33x25 cm. 3. The two gliders per shoe, thus guarantee a good stability fig I 2 fig 3 fig 4 and de cut out holes in the gliders. 4. The two flaps 4 5 made of plastiek material per shoe display a 45 mohility in order to provide at the highest speed a gripping resistance when a regress of the occurs. fig I 2 The flaps 4 5 are held back by the cut uut hollows in the gliders and can thus not be moved beyond 45 . if,f or example they were to move beyond this limit,the shoe would slide backwards for a stroke or twenty cm,as musch on a snow a water surface. 5. The flaps are removable and exchangeable at a mo ment s notice by example simply extracting the rods I 2 Fig 6. The useful life ofthe flaps is much prolonged owing to their being,so to speak contresunk between the two catamaran gliders. 7. As a combination shoe this is in fakt a novelty since it may provide in the winterall the pleasures of wintersports,while in the summer it may be used to walk onwater and offers many sports.

## Description
Background of the InventionThese Snow shoes were specially designed to exend even furthet the pleasures of snow sports. ThaRs to these shoes one may easily learn to ski on ice,one may learn easily also long course skiing.One may further use such shoes as mono ski or climbup slanting slopes or mountainsides from which one ski dQwn,one may also Skate on thin ice of lakes, rivers or canals without any fear or anxiety of breaking through it, since the shoes may also be used to walk on ice water. Burthermore is it possible with these shoes to wade easily through thick and loose snow layers. Additional purpose and advantages of tis invention will reveal themselves in the description and claims which follow and are to be taken together with the appended drawings. The applicant claims the benefit of the filing date of his prio foreign patent application,namelyBelgian Patent Application 5 5529 filed December 13,1982 Summary of Invention This snow shoe is designed in such a way that the under surface is provided with two types of gliders Moreover two flaps are also provided,the purpose of wich is securely to cling into the snow in a reverse slide. On the top surface of the body are means for in serting or attaching the foot of the person. The shoe is made of ultra light syntatic or a wide variety of water resistant material,example ETHO foam polystyrene foam,polyester ,abs ,etc ...and weighs less than 3.5 KG. The invention can be used as a combination shoe,this is in fakt a novelty since it may provide in the winter all the pleasres of winter sports,while in the summer it may be used to walk on the water. Brief Description of Drawings Fig.I is am under side surface view with the Flaps Rod Nuts one can also observe the C t out holes in the Gliders. Fig.2 is an under side surf ace view with the ..flaps which may swivel over 45 and may be fushed against the cut out holes in the gliders. Fig.3 is a view of a prototype shoe on which the flaps are alredy mounted Fig.4 is a view of the prototype shoe without the flaps0 Fig.5 is a view with the snow shoe man on the water. Fig.6 is a view with the snow shoe man walking on melting ice and water. Fig.7 is a view of,from left to right I.the first prototype 2.the shoe without flaps and foot attachment 3 and 4 finished product. Fig.8 Same as above Fig.9 view of the shells with foot attachment for walking on water Fig.10 Finished snow shoe for walking on water. Fig.11 Finished snow shoe for ski on snow,on ice, and long course skiing. Fig.12 left a summershoe and right a wintershoe. In An order to switch over to snow amusement a snow shoe footattament may at will be adapted in a flsh on such combination shoe. SPECIFIC EXAMPLE OF INVENTION The foot is introduced in the shoe piece of the shoe Fig 11 fig 12. The measurements of this shoe piece are ImIOx 33x35 and thus provide an excellent support.In the case of a forward slide of the shoe, both under area flaps 3 4 fig 1, fig 2,fig 3,shall horizontally settle, and thus offer no resistance. In case of eventual reverse move mentof either of these ahoes, these same flaps shall grip the snow or ice in 2 firm manner.Thus provide a firm hold on the ground. When climbing up a slanting hill in the snow, one en counters not the slighest difficulty in doing so, climbing up with thes shoes raises one to the top of the hill. The flaps prevent at all times any regress. Gliding downhill is also vasly improved for all be ginners,Thanks to the stability provided by the twin gliders per shoe without any hindrance from the flaps . When used as mono ski it nay provide ,if so wished, unusual additional enjoment. RECAPITULATION These combination all round snow and watershoes shall undoubtedly appeal to many as an ideal sports article with which one may benefit in tune winter from all the pleasures of the snow, they may even be used by children as a sledge and at the same they provide all the joys of watersports in the somer in a single purchase.
