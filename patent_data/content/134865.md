# Attachment mechanism for a boom.

## Abstract
A gooseneck for rigidly but detachably attaching the boom 9 of a sail powered vehicle to the mast 5 . The gooseneck includes a mast collar 15 which in the unassembled condition is freely slideable over the mast 5 . A boom yoke 17 receives the forward ends of the boom spars 10 . The yoke 17 is vertically rotatable about a fulcrum 31 provided in the mast collar 15 . Cooperating surfaces 27, 51 in the collar and boom yoke 17 lock the yoke to the collar and circumferentially compress the collar onto the mast as the boom is lowered to a horizontal attitude, thus firmly locking the mast collar, and the boom yoke carried thereby, to the mast.
