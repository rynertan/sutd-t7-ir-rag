# Blends of polyolefin plastics with elastomeric plasticizers.

## Abstract
Compositions of matter useful in the preparation of film which is soft and has high tensile, tear and impact strength comprise polyolefin plastics such as polypropylene blended with an elastomeric plasticizer the latter comprises poly ethylene or a copolymer of ethylene and an unsaturated ester of a lower carboxylic acid, olefinic elastomer and a hy drocarbon oil.
