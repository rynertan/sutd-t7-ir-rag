# METHOD AND INSTRUMENT FOR MEASURING MOISTURE

## Abstract
A method and instrument for measuring moisture in a medium measures an electric parameter which depends directly on the conductivity of the medium and on the total contact area between electrodes of the instrument and the moisture in the medium. The instrument includes a probe B including a number of electrodes 8 which is inserted into the medium. Electrical voltage from a direct voltage source 7 is fed to a selected pair of the electrodes 8 by way of a switching circuit 1 . The polarity of the voltage supplied is altered by way of a polarity switching device 2 under the control of a synchronizer 4 . An ammeter 5 is responsive to the current and outputs to a processor 6 arranged to calculate the moisture content.
