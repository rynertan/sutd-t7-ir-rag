# A cosine signal corrector.

## Abstract
A single carrier is amplitude modulated by a signal which is a transform as the sine function of the audio signal, and one set of sidebands is removed. In a receiver 76 , the signal can be recovered by first deriving the Hilbert transform of the sine transform, and multiplying it by the signum of the derivative of the original audio signal to obtain the cosine transform. The sine and cosine transforms are then decoded to obtain the original audio signal.
