# Unsinkable craft with places for kneeling paddlers.

## Abstract
Unsinkable craft capable of being powered even on the crest of very high waves by paddlers who are neither sitting nor standing but are mounted and kneeling on both knees, thus realizing a new and functional operating position.

## Claims
Claims 1. Unsinkable craft able to be steered even on the crest of very high waves by paddlers who are neither sitting nor standing, but kneeling with both legs, folded so as to realize a new and functional operating position. 2. Craft as claimed in claim 1 realized in plastic or other materials, with a hull completely empty or filled with porous light substances such as expanded polystyrene and the like with a tapered shape at the ends for hydrodynamics equipped corresponding to the central part with a place for the knees of one or more paddlers, realized with two impressions parallel to the axis of symmetry and separated by a median swelling to allow the paddlers to mount it some holes between said impressions and the external edge above the water line allow any water which enters the space to flow out. 3. Craft as claimed in the preceding claims, wherein hull 1 is completely closed with no internal access, and on its upper surface are realized, with no loss of continuity, the two impressions 2 and 2 , parallel to the axis of symmetry 3 and to central swelling 4, with holes 5 for water outlet the tapered bow 6 and stern 7 also tapered but at a slightly milder curvature and eventual keel 8 allow the craft to be powered and steered with paddles on the crest of the waves, thus realizing exceptional entertainment and functionality. 4. Craft as claimed in the preceding claims, wherein one or more seats are arranged on the central swelling 4.

## Description
Unsinkable craft with places for kneeling paddlersPatrizio ZANAZZOThis invention concerns an unsinkable craft with places for paddlers who are at the same time mounted and kneeling.Floating boards are known which are used in sport to surf on the crest of waves, preferably in the ocean.Windsurfers are also known, consisting of a device for entertainment and sport on the water of seas, lakes and the like.Finally, from time immemorial, canoes, kayaks and the like have been used, characterized by propulsion by rowers with paddles, seated or in equilibrium with one knee on the bottom.However, these floating surf boards involve atributes of daring and technical ability which make them usable only by champions of the specialty and only in specific ocean areas, while the windsurfers are characterized by wind propuJio Canoes and the like, on the other hand, since they are open and not bridged, are susceptible to being filled with water, overturned and sunk. This makes them unsuited for high seas. The aim of this invention is to realize a completely new type of craft, unsinkable and able to be steered even on the crest of very high waves by paddlers who are neither sitting nor standing, but are mounted on the craft and kneeling on both knees, thus realizing a new and functional operating position.This aim is achieved with a craft made of plastic or other materials, with a hull completely empty or filled with porous light substances such as expanded polystyrene and the like with a tapered shape at the ends for hydrodynamics. Corresponding to the central part, it is equipped with a place for the folded knees of one or more paddlers, realized with two impressions parallel to the axis of symmetry and separated by a median swelling to allow the paddlers to mount it some holes bebetween said impressions and the external edge above the water line allow any water which enters the space to flow out.Unlike all other existing craft, because of its structure and its modest height above water, the finding allows for extremely easy dismounting and mounting.An exemplifying but non limiting embodiment of the invention is represented in the enclosed drawing, figures 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4 show respectively a lateral, top, front and rear view. Figure 5 shows an axonometric view.In the drawing details, the completely closed hull with no internal access is indicated with 1, on the upper surface of which are realized, with no loss of continuity, the two impressions 2 and 2 , parallel to the axis of symmetry 3 and to central swelling 4, with holes 5 for water outlet. The tapered bow 6 and stern 7 also tapered but at a slightly milder curvature and eventual keel 8 allow the craft to be powered and steered with paddles on the crest of the waves, thus realizing exceptional entertainment and functionality.In a variant, one or more seats may be arranged on said swelling 4.Naturally, while the principle of the finding remains the same, the realization, materials, sizes and the details of construction may be widely varied from that described here without going beyond the bounds of this invention.
