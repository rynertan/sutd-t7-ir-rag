# Four wheel drive transmission system.

## Abstract
A transmission system especially useful in performance saloon cars includes a simple epicyclic gear 2 between an engine 1 and a standard gearbox MG or AG . The drive to the front axle 10 is taken from the sun gear 12 . The drive to the rear axle 20 is via the gearbox from the annulus 16 . The torque splits in the optimum ratio between front and rear axles for the gear selected. In first gear and top gear the front rear torque ratios are 1 3 and 3 2 respectively.
