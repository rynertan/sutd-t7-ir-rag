# Double tank type fast breeder reactor.

## Abstract
A double tank type fast breeder reactor including a reac tor vessel 1 , and a tank 11 of a secondary cooling system located outside the reactor vessel. The reactor vessel contains a core 3 and installations of a primary cooling system 4 8 , and the tank contains circulation pumps 13 of the secondary cooling system and steam generators 15 alternately located in the tank, and a body of sodium 12 serving as a secondary coolant located at outer peripheries of the circulation pumps and steam generators. The tank includes an annular portion defined in the tank between walls of the tank and reactor vessel serving as a path of circulation of the secondary cool ant. Each steam generator is small in width and has a shroud 21 surrounding heat transfer tubes 20 defining a narrow annulus between one side wall thereof and the reactor vessel and another narrow annulus between an opposite side wall thereof and the tank, and each circulation pump of the secon dary cooling system has a shroud 22 defining a narrow annulus between one side wall thereof and the reactor vessel and another narrow annulus between an opposite side wall thereof and the tank.
