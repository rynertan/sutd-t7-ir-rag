## Description
SNAP RING, BOLTLESS PIPE JOINTBackgrourd of the Invention The present invention relates to a cast iron pipe joint, and more specifically, to a boltless pipe joint employing a estraining ring and a snap ring. In joining cast iron pipe, it is desirable to produce a joint which is of high strength, good sealing quality, weadily assambled in the field and capable of a reasonable degree of deflection from ho irontal alignment. Prior art pipe joints include a type requiring a retainer ring to be bolted onto a cylindrical bell which was threaded onto an end or one pipe. A second pipe was then inserted into the bell and the retainer ring was then bolted onto the bell.Such operation was time consuming in the field, with usually ten bolts per joint having to be tightened.Further, the strength of such joints in opposition to the flow thrust or separating force between pipes was limited to the shear strength of the bolts and their respective nuts, not a desirable feature. Another prior art type of pipe joint eliminated the need fo a bolted connaction. A bell was threaded into an end of 2 first pipe, and a second pipe was inserted into this bell. A bayonet type locking ring was then inserted into the bell and rotated to contact the respective flanges of the locking ring with the flanges of the bell. Such a joint is more readily assembled than a bolted type joint, out in the event of 2 rotatIon of the locking ring, the joint can soparate. A cordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a pipe joint that is readily assembled in the field, is of high strength and has an improved locking mechanism.Summary of th Invention The present invention provides an improved cast iron pipe joint of z srap ring, boltless design that is of high strength, readily assembled in the field and has an improved locking mechanism and 2 method of assembling such joint. In particular, the present invention provides a join between two ends of two inon pipes comprising a first elongated cvlindrical pipe having an externally threaded end, a cylindrical bell sleeve threaded onto said threaded end of said first pipe, a first cylindrical notch in the interior surface of sa bell slaeve, a sealing gasket within said notch, a ball end of a second pipe inserted into said bell sleeve contacting said sealing gasket, a restraining ring located between said bell sleeve and said ball end of said second pipe, and a snap ring expanded within a sacond cylindrical notch in the interior surface of said bell sleeve to hold said restraining ring and said ball end of said second pipe within said bell sleeve in sealing engagement with said first pipe Further, the present invent on provides a method of joining two pipes compising the steps providing a first pipe having a threaded end, threading a cylindrical bell onto said threaded pipe end, placing a gasket into 2 first notot in the interior surfnce of said cylindrical bell, inserting the bell end of a sacond pipe into said cylindrical bell, placing z circular restraining ring between the interior surface of said a cylindrical bell and th ball end outer surface of said second pipe and expanding a snap ring within a second notch in said cylindrical bell to hold said within said cylindrical bell. In the pipe joint of the present invention, a threaded en c 2 1st ast iron pIpe is provided A A generally cylindrical bell is provided. This bell has an internally threaded smaller diemeter end, and expands in a generally linear manner to a larger diameter unthreaded end. About midway between the ends of the bell, a circular notch is provided on the interior surface. Such rotch is utilized to hold a sealing gasket or o ring which usually is comprised of rubber or similer elastomer.A circular extension on the interior surface of the bell is spaced between the sealing gasket notch ate a second ci rcuja . notch or area of increasad interior section diameter. Such second notch holds a generally cylindrical restraining ring. Such restraining ring has an inner inclined surface and an outer generally flat surface.A third circular notch or area of increased interior section diamëter is adjacent the second notch and is separated from the lage diameter eni of the bell by an overhang or flange.Such third notch contains a snap ring which by its own spring action is expanded into the notch. Such snap ring abuts the restraining ring to hold it against the ball end of a second pipe.The inclined surface of the restraining ring abuts the spherical surf ace of the ball end of the second pipe, thusly maintaining the second pipe in 2 sealing relation with the first pipe by the contact of, the ball end of the second pipe with the sealing gasket. Further, as the restraiaing ring inclined surface contacts the ball end of the secon pipe between the point of greatest diameter of the ball end end the point where the second pipe expands to rorm the ball end, the expanding diameter of the ball end aots t abut the restraining ring and thusly prevent the pull out of the second pipe from the cylindrical bell. Finally, the snap ring insertei into the third notch abuting the end flange of the bell nd the restraining ring maintains the restraining ring and thus the second pipe in sealed engagement with the first pipe. Rotation of the snap ring will have no effect on the seal. Further, the entire cross section or the snap ring maintains the contact between the bell end flangs and the restraining ring. The entire snap ring would have to shear to break the joint of the present nvention.
