## Description
Chemical Process This invention relates to .improvements in or relating to the manufacture of antibiotics. More particularly, it relates to a novel process for the preparation of intermediates of value in the synthesis of certain ss lactam antibiotics, for example, cephalosporins. A number of antibiotic cephalosporin compounds are now known which have a 2 2 aminothiazol 4 yl 2 substituted oxyimino acetamido side chain in the 7 position. It is particularly desirable that the 2 substituted oxyimino group should be in the syn isomeric form, the syn isomers exhibiting greater antibacterial activity than their corresponding antiisomers. The syn configuration of the 7 side chain is defined by the configuration of the oxime substituent with respect to the carboxamido group and may be represented thus EMI1.1 where R is the oxyimino substituent.One such antibiotic, 6R,7R 7 Z 2 2 aminothiazol 4 yl 2 2 carboxyprop 2 oxyimino acetamidol 3 l pyridiniummethyl ceph 3 em 4 carboxylate known by the approved name ceftazidime , is described inter alia in our US Patent Specification No. 4 258 041 and details of its preparation are given therein. One general method for preparing cephalosporin antibiotics having a syn 2 2 aminothiazol 4 yl 2 substituted oxyimino acetamido side chain at the 7 position involves building up the 7 side chain through a series of reactions to form the desired Z 2 2 aminothiazol 4 yl 2 substituted oxyimino acetic acid the side chain acid or a reactive derivative thereof followed by coupling with the 7ss amino cephalosporin nucleus. The side chain acid is in the form of a syn isomer and this is indicated by the Z notation.A series of such reactions for the preparation of protected forms of the side chain acids for ceftazidime and related compounds are described in Preparations 1 to 9 of the above mentioned US Patent Specification. In the first stage of these sequences of reactions, ethyl acetoacetate is reacted with sodium nitrite in acetic acid to give ethyl Z 2 hydroxyiminoacetoacetate which is subsequently reacted with sulphuryl chloride to form ethyl Z 4 chloro 2 hydroxyiminoaceto acetate and then thiourea to form ethyl Z 2 2 amino thiazol 4 yI 2 hydroxyiminoacetate. This compound is then treated to yield the desired side chain acid, e.g. by introducing the substituent on the oxyimino group. However, the yields of the ethyl Z 4 chloro2 hydroxyiminoacetoacetate intermediate and of ethyl Z 2 2 aminothiazol 4 yl 2 hydroxyiminoacetate obtained in this reaction sequence are generally unsatisfactory for commercial production and it is usually necessary to isolate the 4 chloro intermediate in the process. European Patent Application Specification No.45005 describes a process for the preparation of esters of Z 2 2 aminothiazol 4 yl 2 methoxyiminoacetic acid by oximating i.e. nitrosating a 4 chloro acetoacetic acid ester, reacting the resulting 4 chloro 2 hydroxyiminoacetoacetic acid ester, without isolation, with thiourea to give a Z 2 2 aminothiazol 4 yl 2 hydroxy iminoacetic acid ester and then methylating this compound to give the desired product. The nitrosation reaction is effected by reacting the starting compound with an alkali metal nitrite the use of sodium nitrite is exemplified in the presence of acetic acid. However, we have found that the yield of Z 2 2 aminothiazol4 yl 2 hydroxyiminoacetic acid ester obtained in such a process is not particularly satisfactory. British Patent Specification No. 1576625 generically describes inter alia the nitrosation of a 4 halo acetoacetic acid in which the carboxyl group is protected, to form a mixture of syn and anti isomers of the corresponding protected 4 halo 2 hydroxyiminoacetoacetic acid. According to this specification, the nitrosation reaction may be effected using nitrous acid, an alkali metal nitrite or a lower alkyl nitrite, although only the use of sodium nitrite is exemplified. It is indicated that, when an alkyl nitrite is to be used, the reaction should be carried out in the presence of a strong base. Japanese Published Patent Application No. 56100772 describes a process for the preparation of 2 2 aminothiazol 4 yl 2 alkoxyiminoacetic acid esters by reacting an acetoacetic acid ester with an alkyl nitrite in the presence of a mineral acid to give a 2 hydroxyiminoacetoacetic acid ester which is then isolated. The isolated compound is then reacted with a dialkyl sulphate to give the corresponding 2 alkoxyiminoacetoacetate ester, which is itself isolated and reacted with a halogen to form a 4 halo 2 alkoxyiminoacetoacetic acid ester. Finally, the isolated halogenated compound is reacted with thiourea to give the desired final product. There is no indication in this publication as to whether the final product is in the form of a syn or anti isomer, or a mixture of such isomers.Moreover, it is to be noted that it is necessary to isolate the intermediates produced in each stage of the reaction sequence described in Japanese PublishedPatent Application No. 56 100772 and, indeed, a different solvent system is used for each stage. Such a process would be inconvenient and uneconomical to operate on a manufacturing scale. We have now discovered that 4 halo 2 hydroxy iminoacetoacetic acid esters, predominantly in the syn isomeric form, may be obtained in unexpectedly high yield by reaction of 4 halo acetoacetic acid esters which are readily available commercially with an alkyl nitrite under acidic conditions. The 4 halo 2 hydroxyiminoacetoacetic acid ester can then be reacted with thiourea to form the desired 2 2aminothiazol 4 yl 2 hydroxyiminoacetic acid ester in substantially pure syn isomeric form, which is obtained in correspondingly high yield. Furthermore, we have found that high yields of the syn 2 2 aminothiazol4 yl 2 hydroxyiminoacetic acid ester may surprisingly be obtained even when the reaction sequence is effected without isolation of the intermediate 4 halo 2 hydroxyiminoacetic acid ester.We have found that even on large scale operation the new process enables the preparation of syn 2 2 aminothiazol 4 yl 2 hydroxyimino acetic acid esters in high yield and in a simple and economic manner. Thus, the new process has considerable advantages in manufacturing terms. Thus, according to one aspect of the invention there is provided a process for the preparation of a 4 halo 2 hydroxyiminoacetoacetic acid ester in which a 4 halo acetoacetic acid ester is reacted with an alkyl nitrite under acidic conditions. The starting 4 halo acetoacetic acid ester for the process of the invention is generally an alkyl ester such as a C14 alkyl ester e.g. an ethyl ester.The 4 halo substituent may conveniently be chlorine or bromine. The alkyl nitrite starting material is generally a C16 alkyl nitrite such as, for example, methyl nitrite, butyl nitrite,iso amyl nitrite and preferably isopropyl nitrite. Where the 4 halo 2 hydroxyiminoacetoacetic acid ester prepared according to the invention is subsequently converted into a side chain acid ester containing a further blocked carboxyl group COOR for example in the substituted oxyimino moiety, as in protected forms of the ceftazidime side chain acid it may be necessary, prior to a coupling reaction with an amino B lactam, to remove the original ester group by selective hydrolysis whilst retaining the carboxyl blocking group R . It will be appreciated that in such instances the esterifying group in the starting 4 haloacetoacetic acid ester is desirably one which may readily be removed by a method which does not affect the carboxyl blocking group R . The nitrosation reaction of the invention is effected under acidic conditions e.g. in the presence of a mineral acid such as hydrochloric or sulphuric acid. The reaction may conveniently be effected in the presence of one or more organic solvents and or an excess of the alkyl nitrite. Examples of solvents which may be employed include hydrocarbons such as a light petroleum, toluene or benzene, ethers such as diisopropyl ether, diethyl ether or dioxan, esters such as ethyl acetate, and or alcohols such as isopropyl alcohol. Isopropyl alcohol is a particularly convenient solvent when isopropyl nitrite is used, as isopropyl alcohol is a product of the reaction. The solvent system is generally chosen so that optimal solubility for the starting materials is obtained and a mixture of solvents may be employed.The solvents used should be liquid at the temperature selected for the reaction which may, for example, be from 50 to 150 0c, preferably from 0 to 50 C. The 4 halo 2 hydroxyiminoacetoacetic acid ester, may if desired be isolated from the reaction medium and optionally crystallised prior to a subsequent reaction with thiourea to form the desired 2 2 aminothiazol 4 yl 2 hydroxyiminoacetic acid ester substantially in the syn isomeric form. However, isolation is not essential and it may be more convenient to react the 4 halo compound directly, without isolation, with thiourea to give the desired aminothiazolyl compound.Thus, it will be noted that the desired side chain acid ester is obtained substantially in the syn isomeric form whether or not the 4 halo intermediate is isolated. The reaction of the 4 halo 2 hydroxyiminoacetoacetic acid ester prepared according to the invention with thiourea is preferably carried out in the presence of a base, such as pyridine or N,N dimethylaniline.If the reaction is effected without isolation of the 4 halo intermediate, it is generally necessary to remove any nitrosating species from the reaction medium which may remain after the nitrosation step in order to prevent these species from reacting with the syn 2 2 aminothiazol 4 yl 2 hydroxyiminoacetic acid ester. As such nitrosating species are generally volatile compounds they may conveniently be removed by passing a stream of an inert gas, such as nitrogen, through the reaction medium. It will be appreciated that where the 4 halo product is isolated prior to reaction with thiourea, then any nitrosating species will be removed in the isolation step. The reaction with thiourea is conveniently effected in the presence of one or more organic solvents such as esters, ethers and or alcohols, for example as described above for the reaction with the alkyl nirite, optionally in admixture with water. It is particularly convenient to use one or more alcohols as the solvent since this facilitates the subsequent crystallisation of the desired final product. It is convenient to effect the reaction with thiourea at a temperature of 50 to 150 C, preferably from 0 to 50 C. The syn 2 2 aminothiazol 4 yl 2 hydroxyiminoacetic acid ester produced by the process may be recovered from the reaction medium by any convenient means, such as by crystallisation. As indicated above, cephalosporin antibiotic compounds having a syn substituted oxyimino group in the 7 side chain have been found to exhibit enhanced antibacterial properties. It is generally desirable to employ the syn isomeric form of the side chain acid in their preparation. The process of the invention has been found to enhance greatly the yields of the syn isomers of both the 4 halo intermediate and the side chain acid ester. In particular, the 4 halo intermediate is obtained predominantly as its synisomer e.g. containing at least 75 and preferably 85 , of the syn isomer. When the 4 halo intermediate is isolated in crystalline form, it has been found to be substantially in the syn isomeric form.In order to maximise the recovery of the 2 2 aminothiazol4 yl 2 hydroxyiminoacetic acid ester, this compound is preferably isolated as a free base as this assists in the crystallisation of the syn isomer, leaving any anti isomer in solution in the solvents normally used. The process of the invention and the subsequent reaction with thiourea enable syn 2 2 aminothiazol4 yl 2 hydroxyiminoacetic acid esters to be obtained in high yield. The product may then be subjected to a further series of reactions to yield a compound which may, for example, be coupled to a Th amino cephalosporin to give an antibiotic cephalosporin such as ceftazidime, for example as described in our US Patent Specification No. 4258041. Syn 2 2 aminothiazol 4 yl 2 hydroxyiminoacetic acid esters prepared according to the invention may also be used in the preparation of other B lactam antibiotics, e.g. cephalosporin antibiotics such as cefotaxime, cefmenoxime, ceftriaxon, ceftizoxime and cefodizime, as well as monocyclic 8 lactam antibiotics such as azthreonam. The process according to the invention will be illustrated by the following non limiting examples.In the examples, all temperatures are in C. HPLC is high performance liquid chromatography.
