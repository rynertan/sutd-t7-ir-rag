## Description
The present invention is related to obtaining a functionally intact whole gene directly from a genome, said gene being suitable for expression of gene products. The present invention further relates to a method of excising a complete gene from a genome in a single step and cloning the gene thus obtained. Applicants are the first to develop a novel method of obtaining a complete functionally intact gene in a single step, as disclosed herein Once DNA fragments have been prepared, they are ligated into viral or plasmid vectors where they are reproduced. If the DNA contains a gene which codes for a protein product most often this is the commercial reason to clone the DNA in the first place , the expression production of that protein or some part of it by the clone of interest is used to detect the gene containing clone. A commonly used method to detect these protein products is binding of antibodies specific for the protein product. The cDNA technique, which is most commonly used for preparing DNA for cloning, has the following limitations 1 In almost every case only part of the gene is cloned 2 The piece of the cloned gene is usually biased toward the part which codes for the carboxyl terminal end of the protein 3 The technique depends on a ready supply of mRNA which is only made, in most cases, in certain tissues or life cycle stages which may be difficult to obtain. The present invention obviates the problems of the cDNA technique by cloning the complete gene in a single step. This reduces the time needed to get the complete gene, which of course, can also be obtained after cDNA cloning, but by going on to the restriction endonuclease method of preparing DNA for cloning and repeating the cloning process. Since the method of detection of a clone may be biased away from the structures displayed in the protein at the carboxyl terminal end, the technique of the present invention, which clones the complete gene, would not be subject to that Problem. This could be exemplified by a cell surface membrane antigen where the immune system only produced antibodies against amino terminal portions of the protein. Finally, the technique of the present invention prepares DNA fragments containing the genes in direct proportion to the number of copies of that gene in the genome rather than to the relative amount of mRNA present in the biological sample available. This advantage overcomes the problem of cloning a gene for a protein which is present in only limited quantity or which is produced in only tiny amounts by a cell sample and which can be detected only be sensitive detection methods. This is so because the mRNA to make the cDNA for the gene of interest is normally present only in cells where the protein is made. The other two commonly used techniques may not have the disadvantages of the cDNA technique, but in turn have disadvantages of their own. The random shear method does not suffer from the lack of mRNA, but like the cDNA technique most often results in the cloning of only a portion of the gene. Also due to the small sizes of the pieces of DNA used in this method a larger number of clones must be examined to find the gene. The restriction endonuclease method of preparing DNA for cloning is usually a required second step for the cDNA and for random shear techniques to eventually clone the entire gene. It also may be used to clone genes directly, but has the disadvantage that numerous restriction enzymes must be tried to find just one of The present invention provides advantages over the prior art techniques by first cutting the DNA at specific sites, less than 100 bases from the front and the rear of the coding area of the gene. It does not cut randomly within the gene. This results in DNA pieces containing the whole gene as opposed to fragments or small portions of a gene. The frequency of the appropriate DNA fragment in the clone mixture is dependent on gene copy number and the size of the DNA of the genome rather than the amount of mRNA available. Furthermore, the close proximity of the cut site to the start of the gene makes the DNA suitable for expression of the gene product in many expression vectors. Moreover, the cut is not specific for a certain base sequence, rather it recognizes a structure in the DNA and cuts somewhat randomly within a certain base stretch overcoming the problem existing for many expression vectors of the DNA having to be in the right reading frame to allow the gene product to be expressed. The present invention is useful for eukaryotic genomes It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to obtain an isolated, functionally intact whole gene from a eucaryolic source by treating genomic DNA from said source under controlled conditions with mung bean nuclease and formamide in an amount sufficient for releasing said gene from said source. It is a further object of the present invention to clone the isolated complete gene. It is another object of the present invention to provide a bank or library of intact whole genes or gene fragments derived from said intact whole genes or reconstructed recombinant variations thereof. It is a still further object of the present invention to obtain useful macromolecules including gene products from the cloned whole gene. Another object of the present invention is to provide a method of obtaining intact whole gene in a single step process of treating the genomic DNA with a mixture comprising mung bean nuclease and denaturing agent. As to the operating conditions, it was found that the preferred amount of mung bean nuclease ranges between about 0.5 and about 2 units of nuclease per µg of DNA. On the other hand it was also found that the preferred amount of formamide ranges between about 5 to about 65 by volume of the reaction mixture. A most preferred condition consists in using for 1 unit of mung bean nuclease, a formamide amount ranging from about 30 to about 45 , whereby DNA is treated at about 50 C for about 30 minutes in a buffer solution at a pH of about 4.6, and the obtained gene is thereafter isolated from the reaction mixture. Other objects and advantages will become apparent as the description of the present invention proceeds. These and other objects, features and many of the attendant advantages of the invention will be better understood upon a reading of the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings wherein Fig. 1 shows an analysis of DNA fragments released from genomic DNA by mung bean nuclease digestion. Fig. 2 shows a map of mung bean cleavage sites in the Fig. 3 is a map of the plasmid pPbSL7.8 insert and shows restriction sites as well as 3 mung bean cleavage sites which occur in restrictions containing 45 formamide. The thick lines represent. from left to right, the coding area for the small rRNA, the 5.05 RNA and 2.2 kb of the large rRNA of Genomic DNA 5 µg was digested with mung bean nuclease in 40 lane 3 or 45 lane 4 formamide. The products were compared by Southern blot analysis using a radiolabelled plasmid pPbSL5.6 probe which contains ony the gene for the small rRNA subunit. The band at 6.7 kb in lane 1 results from hybridization of the probe to a pBr322 derived sequence on the blot. These and other objects and advantages are achieved by the present invention which comprises an isolated, functionally intact whole gene and a method of isolating a functionally intact whole gene comprising treating a source of said gene with an amount of mung bean nuclease and formamide sufficient for releasing said gene from said source. Any eukaryotic genomic source containing genes can be employed for the practice of this invention. Mung bean nuclease is commercially available, for example from Pharmacia P L Biochemicals, Piscataway, New Jersey. The enzyme is used in an amount sufficient to excise the DNA, for example 1 unit of enzyme per 1 µg of DNA. But the amount may vary from 0.5 unit to 2 units or the like depending on the reaction conditions. The enzyme unit is that as defined by the supplier, e.g. Pharmacia P L Biochemicals. Formamide is employed at a concentration range of about 5 to 65 v v in the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture is a buffer solution having a pH of about 4.2 4.8. A preferred buffer solution comprises about 0.2M Nacl, 1mM ZZnSO₄ and 30mM Na acetate, pH 4.6. The term gene or expression product includes such entities as messenger, transfer, soluble and ribosomal ribonucleic acids, peptide, poly peptide or proteins and antibodies made against said peptide or protein. Included within the scope of the present invention are also partial fragments, recombinants, or any other form of reconstructed or reconstituted entities derived from the isolated intact gene obtained in accordance with the present invention. Typically mung bean nuclease reaction is carried out in a volume of 100 µl with 1 unit of enzyme per 1 µg of genomic DNA at about 50 C in varying concentrations of formamide, preferably about 20 50 v v for about 20 40 minutes in 0.2M NaCl, 1 mM ZnSO₄ and 30mM Na acetate, pH 4.6. The incubation is carried out for a sufficient time, usually about 30 minutes in the above reaction mixture. Then, the solution is diluted 4 fold with about 0.01M ethylenediamine tetraacetate EDTA and extracted with phenol as is well known in the art. DNA fragments containing the desired intact whole genes are then isolated from this reaction mixture by precipitating said DNA fragments with 2 volumes of absolute ethanol. The precipitate is left overnight at 20 C, then centrifuged at about 10,000 rpm 12,000g for about 30 minutes in a refrigerated centrifuge. The residue comprising the isolated intact gene S is rinsed with 80 ethanol in H₂O, the supernatant poured off, the residue recentrifrized if necessary and then dried in vacuum. The dried DNA representing the intact whole complete gene can then either be stored at 20 C or dissolved in a suitable buffer, e.g. 10mM tris HCl, pH 7.5 containing 1mM NaEDTA and used for subsequent steps e.g., cloning, transcription, translation, electrophoresis and the like or for obtaining other gene products or macromolecules proteins, antibodies, and the like or stored frozen for later use as desired. Cloning of isolated whole gene can be accomplished by any suitable technique, such as described by Young and Davis in Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 80 1194, 1983 and Science, 222 778, 1983 Any suitable cloning vehicle, e.g. a microbial or yeast plasmid or a bacteriophage and the like can be employed to clone the whole gene. A preferred cloning vehicle is λgt11. In order to test for or produce the product s coded by the isolated gene, the gene is artificially introduced into an expression vector, preferably a unicellular organism capable of expressing said gene usually in the form of a peptide or protein. The polypeptide or protein thus expressed is usually identified by standard techniques such as immunological procedures, electrophoresis, aminoacid sequencing and the like. Depending on the importance and significance of the expression product e.g., protein , scientifically, commerically, pharmaceutically, etc., the expression product can be further used to produce antibodies mono or poly clonal or the like, all of which are envisaged within the scope of the present invention. For analyzing the results of mung bean nuclease digestion under various controlled conditions, standard Southern blot analysis is employed as described by Southern, J. Mol Biol. 98 503, 1975. Both unlabelled or radiolabelled probes can be used. The term functionally intact means the gene is capable of encoding, controlling or directing all those functions which are inherent in a gene, e.g. transcription, translation and the like. As an illustrative example of the present invention, genomic DNA was cleaved with mung bean nuclease under a series of controlled conditions and the gene products analyzed by Southern blot analysis. Cloned genes isolated from Four different DNAs were used as radiolabelled probes for Southern blot analysis, cDNAs for chicken B actin and Investigation of the area surrounding the histidine rich protean HRP of The circumsporozoite protein gene was investigated using clone pmPf5 as a probe, which contains the complete coding area of the gene as described by Dame et al in To determine the site of mung bean nuclease cleavage, fragments generated by mung bean nuclease digestion were cloned and sequenced. This was accomplished by combining equal aliquots of DNA from 35 and 40 formamide mung bean nuclease reactions shown in Fig. 1D and ligating them into the expression vector, λgt11. Two hundred thousand inserts containing clones were immunologically screened with monocolonal antibodies specific for the circumsporozoite protein of It should be noted that cleavage depends on the structure of the naked DNA. A cloned DNA sequence synthesized in and isolated from Isolated intact genes in accordance with the present invention can, of course, be preserved as a gene bank or library. An exemplary λgt11 library is constructed as follows. One of the benefits of the present invention is the recombinant libraries can be produced containing mostly complete gene fragments. The presentation of any gene in the library then relates directly to its copy number in the genome. This is of special importance with regard those conditions where proteins of importance are not easily available because such proteins are produced during a particular stage in the life cycle of an organism or are not available in sufficient quantity. Isolation of intact genes, cloning thereof and producing protein from cloned isolated gene and using the protein to produce antibodies mono or polyclonal , all of which are now made possible by the present invention, opens a new vista in bio technology. Such was not heretofore possible for the simple reason that intact functional genes could not be isolated directly from genome in a simple, efficient, single step reaction. The fact that the mung bean nuclease technique has been found to be successful in obtaining functionally intact complete isolated genes from such organism as
