# CONCRETE SET MODIFICATION WITH ENCAPSULED SURFACTANT

## Abstract
A composition of matter useful for retarding the set time of concrete rormulations significantly without adding more water thereto comprises a high molecular weight condensa tion product of naphthalenesulfonic acid and formaldehyde, preferably an alkali metal salt derivative thereof, which is encapsulated within a matrix of a water soluble polymer which is polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, hydroxy ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, or polyacrylamide. By use of such a polymer encapsulated surfactant, the set time of a concrete formulation can be delayed significantly from that containing the surfacant alone, and the applicabil ity of the concrete formulation can be greatly extended.
