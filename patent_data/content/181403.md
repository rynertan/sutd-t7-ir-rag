# PROCESS FOR PREPARING INORGANIC FIBERS.

## Abstract
A process for preparing inorganic fibers having excellent stringiness, which comprises heating an organic solvent solution containing 85 wt or more polymetalloxane and having a viscosity of 5,000 P or more at 25 C or solid polymetalloxane to prepare a spinning solution of 1 to 3,000 P in viscosity, spinning the solution to form fiber precursor, and baking the precursor.
