# Novel silicon containing oxime compounds, a method for their preparation, and anti tumor agents containing the same.

## Abstract
Various kinds of organosilicon compounds are already known having anti tumour activity. Their relatively strong toxicity however has impeded a wide use of such compounds in actual therapy. The primary object of the invention is to provide a novel anti tumor agent comprising as its therapeutically effective ingredient, an organosilicon compound having low or no toxicity. The novel compound is a trihydrocarbylsilylmethyloxyimino alkane, which is a silicon containing oxime compound hitherto not described in any prior art literatures, represented by the general formula R 1 3Si CH2 O N Y.
