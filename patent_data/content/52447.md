## Description
Winding Machine This invention relates to a winding machine with a device for facilitating start up of winding by the operator on empty bobbin tubes. The device is of use even if only one bobbin tube is mounted on each spindle of the winding machine but is especially useful if each spindle is to carry more than one bobbin, with the result that the operator has to start up winding on more than one bobbin at the same time. According to the invention, a winding machine for winding yarn on a bobbin carried on a winding spindle and including at least one yarn traversing means for forming a yarn package, is characterised in that at least one first guide is provided for guiding yarn to a bobbin tube on the spindle, in that a guide support carries at least one further guide for guiding yarn from said first guide to means for removing waste yarn from the winding machine, and in that the path of yarn between said first guide and said further guide lies over a region of the surface of a bobbin tube, said support being movable along a path so as to displace said yarn over said bobbin tube surface axially of the spindle to a location at which the yarn is gripped to begin winding it on the bobbin tube. The path of the yarn between said first guide and said further guide may lie over a region of the surface of a bobbin tube which rotates, during winding, in the opposite direction to the direction of movement of said yarn over said surface. The arrangement may be such that the yarn is gripped between said bobbin tube and an adjacent bobbin tube or a flange on the winding spindle. Said guide support may comprise a rod mounted for movement in the direction of its length and the arrangement may be such that the movement can be effected by pushing the rod against the action of a spring which returns the rod to its original position when the rod is released. The yarn may be guided downwardly on one side of the winding spindle to a yarn guide below the spindle serving as said first guide and which may be constituted by a roller on a pivotally mounted arm connected to control a drive motor for the winding spindle so as to control yarn tension.From said first guide the yarn moves upwardly on the opposite side of the winding spindle and passes over the surface of a bobbin tube on the spindle to said further guide which is located above the winding spindle. The invention will now be further described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a diagrammatic side elevation of part of a machine according to the invention, and Figure 2 is a diagrammatic end elevation of the machine of Figure 1 in the direction of the arrow A in Figure 1. The winding machine shown in the drawings comprises a winding spindle 5 driven by an electric motor 6. The winding spindle 5 is adapted, in conventional manner, to receive four bobbin tubes 7, 8, 9.and 10. Yarn traversing means comprising yarn guides 13, 14, 15 and 16 each reciprocated by a separate scroll cam not shown housed in a traverse mechanism housing 17 are provided for the bobbin tubes 7, 8, 9 and 1O, Four yarns 18, 19, 20 and 21 are forwarded to the winding machine by godets 22, 23, 24 and 25, respectively. The yarns may come directly from a spinning machine or from another yarn source, for example a yarn package, not shown .The yarns 18, 19, 20 and 21 are guided from the godets 22, 23, 24 and 25, respectively, through yarn guides 28, 29, 30 and 31, respectively, downwardly on one side of the winding spindle 5 through guides 32, 33, 34 and 35, respectively, and downwardly to pulleys 36, 37, 38 and 39, respectively, which also serve as yarn guides. The guides 28 to 35 are mounted on the machine frame, such mounting being indicated diagrammatically in the drawings. Each of the pulleys 36, 37, 38 and 39 is mounted on a respective arm. Only one arm 42 is shown, in Figure 2, but each arm is pivotally mounted and connected to a conventional motor control mechanism so as to control the speed of the motor 6 in known manner in dependence upon the tensions in the yarns 18, 19, 20 and 21. After passing round the pulleys 36, 37, 38 and 39, the yarns 18, 19, 20 and 21 are forwarded upwardly on the side of the winding spindle 5 remote from the said one side to the bobbin tubes 7, 8, 9 and 10, respectively, and move over regions of the surfaces of the bobbin tubes remote from the said one side of the winding spindle mentioned above, that is, remote from the yarn guides 32, 33, 34 and 35. From the bobbin tubes 7, 8, 9 and 10, the yarns pass through guides 43, 44, 45 and 46, respectively, and thence to an aspirator 47 fixed on the frame of the machine and constituting means for removing waste yarn from the winding machine. The guides 43, 44, 45 and 46 are all secured to a support constituted by a rod 48 of rectangular cross section nonrotatably mounted in apertured plates 49 and 50 secured to the frame of the winding machine. A spring 53 between the plate 49 and a knob 54 on the end of the rod 48 urges the rod 48 to the left in Figure 1. Rotatably mounted in apertured plates 55 and 56 secured to the traverse mechanism housing 17 is a rod 57 on which are mounted four wire tailing guides 60, 61, 62 and 63. A bail roll 64 is mounted on the traverse mechanism housing 17. On starting up winding, the yarns 18, 19, 20 and 21 are threaded round the godets 22, 23, 24 and 25, respectively, through the guides 28, 29, 30 and 31, respectively, and through the guides 32, 33, 34 and 35, respectively. From the guides 32, 33, 34 and 35, the yarns are passed round the pulleys 36, 37, 38 and 39, respectively, over the bobbins 7, 8, 9 and 10, respectively, through the guides 43, 44, 45 and 46, respectively, and are offered to the aspirator 47 which removes the running yarns from the winding machine.The operator can thread up only one yarn at a time and when he has completed threading up all four yarns he pushes the rod 48 to the right in Figure 1, thereby moving the yarn guides 43, 44, 45 and 46 mounted on that rod to the right and carrying the yarns 18, 19 and 20 into V shaped slots 65, 66 and 67, respectively, formed by chamfered edges of adjacent bobbins 7 and 8, 8 and 9 and 9 and 10, respectively. The yarn 21 is carried into a V shaped slot 68 formed between a chamfered edge of the bobbin 10 and a chamfered flange 69 on the spindle 5. Having entered the V shaped slots 65, 66, 67 and 68, the yarns 18, 19 and 20 are trapped between the bobbins 7 and 8, 8 and 9 and 9 and 10, respectively, and the yarn 21 is trapped between the bobbin 10 and the flange 69.Clockwise rotation of the spindle 5 and of the bobbins 7, 8, 9 and 10, as seen in Figure 2, will therefore carry the yarns from paths such as the path 72, shown in chain dotted lines in Figure 2, to paths such as the path 73, shown in full line in that Figure, so that the yarns pass through the nip between the bail roll 64 and the bobbins 7, 8, 9 and 10 and begin to wind on to the respective bobbins. In this situation, each yarn is restricted by a respective tailing guide 60, 61, 62 or 63 to winding only on to an end portion of the corresponding bobbin. After a sufficient tail for each yarn has been wound, the rod 57 carrying the tailing guides 60, 61, 62 and 63 is rotated clockwise, as seen in Figure 2, to bring the tailing guides clear of the yarns and allow normal winding to commence. The yarns then migrate, in the usual way, to paths at right angles to their respective bobbin axes and are captured by the yarn guides 13, 14, 15 and 16, respectively, since each yarn path then crosses the path of the associated yarn guide as the guide executes its reciprocating movements. Thereafter, normal winding proceeds, each yarn 18, 19, 20 or 21 being guided to the respective bobbin. As an alternative to the yarn paths shown, the yarns 18, 19, 20 and 21 may be threaded up for start up so that they pass upwardly from the pulleys 36, 37, 38 and 39, respectively, on the same side of the winding spindle 5 as they move down to the pulleys, and pass between the bail roll 64 and the bobbin tubes 7, 8, 9 and 10, respectively, the winding spindle 5 being located in the conventional way at start up so as to space the surfaces of the bobbin tubes a short distance from the bail roll. The yarns 18, 19, 20 and 21 are still arranged, however, to lie on paths which bring them into contact with the surfaces of the bobbin tubes 7, 8, 9 and 10, respectively. The yarns continue to the guides 43, 44, 45 and 46, respectively, and then to the aspirator 47. The position of these guides would be altered so that in achieving these yarn paths the yarns did not come into contact with the support rod 48. Each of the yarn paths in this instance lies over a region of the surface of a bobbin tube which rotates during winding in the same direction as the direction of movement of the yarn over that surface. In certain circumstances, for example when using strong yarns, it may be desirable to provide, intermediate the bobbin tubes 7 10 and the aspirator 47, yarn severing means which is ineffective to sever the yarn when. it is moving from the respective bobbin tube to the aspirator, but which acts rapidly to sever the yarn when the yarn starts to move in the direction from the aspirator to the bobbin tube. A hinged knife, associated with each yarn guide 43 46, whose cutting action is occasioned by yarn travel in one, but not in the opposite, direction may be employed for this purpose.
