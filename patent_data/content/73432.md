# Connecting device for medical liquid containers.

## Abstract
A connecting device for medical liquid administration sets, particularly for use in continuous ambulatory perito neal dialysis comprises a tubular port extending from a medical liquid container. The tubular port has a pierceable diaphragm positioned within and sealing the same. A hollow tubular piercing pin having a sharpened tip is used for penetrating the pierceable diaphragm. A length of flexible tubing extends from the piercing pin and is connected to a catheter positioned in the peritoneum of the patient once the piercing pin and port are connected. A locking mechanism is utilized for selectively retaining the piercing pin within the tubular port following insertion, and for asepticizing the connection.
