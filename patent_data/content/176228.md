## Description
The present invention relates to the field of ink jet inks which are used in impulse drop on demand types of ink jet printers. More particularly, the present application relates to such ink jet inks which exhibit good crack and smear resistances, are heat stable, and are easily jettable using drop on demand type apparatus. Originally, printing with hot melt type ink was suggested in connection with electrostatic printing apparatuses. In U.S. Patent 3,653,932 Berry et al , entitled Electrostatic Printing Composition Comprising Didodecyl Sebacate , an electrostatic printing process is disclosed using an ink comprised of one or more of specified di esters. In the Berry process, ink is heated into a fluid phase and is caused to form a convex meniscus at the nozzle tip by hydrostatic pressure. This pressure causes the end of the ink to intrude into an electrostatic field. Ink is then electrostatically drawn into a single file stream of drops which traverses the span between the tip of the nozzle and the carrier. The preferred inks for use in this process are di esters of sebacic acid which have been esterified with alcohols of paraffins having 12 or less carbon atoms in their chains. Each of the preferred inks is disclosed as having a melting point which does not exceed about 51 U.S. Patent No. 3,715,219 Kurz et al discloses a similar electrostatic printing process using an ink composition comprising about 3 by weight of a dye, and the remainder a vehicle comprised at least one alcohol of the paraffin series which has the general formula CH₃ CH₂ More recently, impulse ink jet printing processes using hot melt inks have been disclosed. Impulse ink jet printing differs from electrostatic printing in that individual droplets are discharged from a printing head in response to relatively low pressures which are typically achieved using piezoelectric head elements. Unlike electrostatic printing processes, such drop on demand processes produce much larger droplets which decelerate, not accelerate, as they move towards the carrier. One recent hot impulse ink jet hot melt ink is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,390,369 Merritt et al , entitled Natural Wax Containing Ink Jet Inks . This patent discloses the use of a number of natural waxes, such as Japan wax, candelilla wax, carnauba wax, etc. These waxes may be used at percentages of from 0.5 to 97.0 by weight either as the basic fluid vehicle of the ink or as an additive to other fluidic vehicles such as fatty acids, more particularly oleic acid or oleic acid with benzyl ether. Merritt et al disclose a number of such inks having viscosities of 6.7 to 15.7 at 165 In related European Publication 99682 A2 a number of hot melt impulse ink jet inks are disclosed which are described as being solid or semi solid at ambient temperature. The preferred ink is disclosed as comprising stearic acid in an approximate weight range from 50 to 99 . As explained in that application, commercially available stearic acids are produced from saponified and distilled animal fats, usually being composed of 60 liquid and 40 solid acid, the bulk of the liquid acids being separated from the solid acids by hydraulic pressing to produce, for example, single pressed, double pressed, triple pressed stearic acids etc. According to the Applicants have found that stearic acid containing inks exhibit very good jettability, good heat stability 3 5 days at 120 Notwithstanding the advances which have been in the art of hot melt ink jet ink printing, a need still exists for inks which are impulse jettable, heat stable, material compatible especially with the coloring agents employed , and which exhibit good print qualities, particularly good resistances to smearing and cracking. The formulation of high quality impulse ink jet inks requires the balancing of many important factors. For example, hot melt inks which have relatively low melting points are typically susceptible to smearing. As the melting points of those inks are increased, smearing resistance is improved, but the viscosity increases. While the viscosity of many inks can be reduced to a jettable range by increasing the temperatures at which they are jetted, higher jetting temperatures bring with them heat stability problems which can lead to the decomposition of the subject inks when heated over long periods of time in typical drop on demand type printers. For example, the aforementioned U.S. Patent 3,715,219 describes compositions having a preferred melting point which does not exceed about 61 C and a freezing point which is not below about 30 C. In view of the low melting points of these compositions Example III reporting the highest at 58 C , such inks are notoriously subject to smudging. This is a direct consequence of the relative softness of such materials at room temperature. It would be desirable to use materials which generally have melting points of at least 65 C, as these would clearly be solids at room temperature. Many of the compositions as suggested by U.S. Patent 3,715,219, in contrast, would probably best be described as semi solids. The present invention provides in one aspect, a hot melt impulse ink jet ink, comprising Aliphatic acids, alcohols and ketones are the preferred type. In another aspect the invention provides a hot melt impulse ink jet ink, comprising By major proportion by weight is meant more than 50 wt of the total ink. In a further aspect the invention provides a method of ink jet printing comprising The coloring agent may be a dye, for example nigrosine base. The preferred amount of coloring agent present is 1 to 5 wt , more especially 2 to 3 wt . The plasticizer is preferably present in an amount of 2 to 3 wt . The plasticizer assists prevention of cracking and smearing of the ink upon solidification of it on the substrate employed in printing. The plasticizer employed preferably has a melting point of 80 120 C. An acrylic resin is one suitable plasticizer. The ink should preferably comprise at least 86 wt of the vehicle the ink therefore preferably containing from 86 to 99.9 wt of the vehicle. The vehicle preferably comprises 40 90, more preferably 50 70 wt of said C₂₀ C₂₄ acid s . The preferred inks of the present invention have a melting point of at least 65 C, and satisfy the aforementioned viscosity requirements within the 80 90 C range of intended operating temperatures. In addition to the C₂₀ C₂₄ component the inks may also comprise minor proportions of shorter chain acids or alcohols in the C₁₄ C₁₉ range, preferably aliphatic. Such shorter chain acids are generally present because commercial grades of acids such as behenic acid comprise such materials. Commercial grade behenic acid, which comprises approximately 70 C₂₀ C₂₄ acids most of the remainder being stearic acid has been found to be a suitable primary component for an impulse ink jet vehicle due to its heat stability and compatibility with colorants, such as nigrosine base. As a relatively higher molecular weight material, however C₂₀ C₂₄ acids are somewhat more prone to cracking than their lower molecular weight counterparts. Moreover, in order to achieve good jettability with state of the art printers, inks of the present invention should preferably exhibit viscosities of no more than about 14 x10 ³Pa.s. at 80 C, such that they may be jetted at operating temperatures of between 80 and 90 C. When commercial grades of behenic acids are employed, the vehicle may contain lesser amounts of C₁₄ C₁₉ acid s or alcohol s , once again with acids being preferred over alcohols. In any event, it is preferred that the weight of the C₂₀ C₂₄ component of the vehicle be at least 150 , and preferably twice, the weight of the C₁₄ C₁₉ component of the vehicle. One preferred ink of the present invention consists of about 80 wt of a commercial behenic acid product Hydrofol 2260 15 wt stearone 3 of a dye, such as nigrosine base and 2 plasticizer acrylic resin, Acryloid DM 55 . As said ketone for use in the inks of the invention, stearone is preferred. Stearone is 18 pentatriacontanone and has a melting point of 87.8 C. Another suitable ketone is laurone. The ketone s will have a melting point of from 65 to 120 C, normally 80 to 120 C and preferably 80 to 110 C. This assists in plasticizing the ink on hardening and may also assist solubility of the coloring agent and gives good heat stability. As an alternative, the vehicle may comprise 0 to 70 wt of waxes, such as candelilla wax, which melt at or above 65 C. A preferred wax containing vehicle comprises 20 25 wt C₂₀ C₂₄ acid s 5 15 wt C₁₄ C₁₉ acid s and 65 70 wt candelilla wax. Other suitable waxes include bamboo leaf, certain beeswaxes, caranda, carnauba, hydrogenated castor oil, Chinese insect, cotton, cranberry, certain Douglas fir bark, esparto, certain flax, Indian corn, Madagascar, most microcrystalline waxes, montan, ouricury, ozocerite, palm, peat wax, rice bran, shellac wax, sisal hemp, sorghum grain, Spanish moss, and refined sugar cane waxes.
