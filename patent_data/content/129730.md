# Photo electro data memory.

## Abstract
A photo electro data memory uses a record member comprising the colour centres in sodium fluoride, and which is exposed to laser light of wavelength 577 and 607nm while being subjected first to an electric field of 50 volts, and then of 100 volts. A different photo electro reaction is induced in the material where the light falls, depending on the light fre quency and the electric field, and these different reactions can be subsequently read.

## Description
PHOTO ELECTRO DATA MEMORY DESCRIPTION Technical Field This invention relates to a photo electro data memory. Background Art The patent to Castro et al, U.S. 4,101,976, describes an optical data storage system that utilizes the frequency dimension to increase the storage capacity significantly. The system includes a storage material, for example, in the form of a block, adapted to undergo a photo induced reaction upon exposure to light and which exhibits inhomogeneous absorption line broadening. Data bits are stored by selective photo induced reactions induced by a narrow band laser at specific frequencies within the broad inhomogeneous line. The lifetime of these photo induced data bits is of the order of years so as to provide a nonvolatile storage system. In a preferred embodiment a material is selected so that the photo induced reactions can be made reversible thereby permitting, when desired, the erasing of the data bits. The patent to Carson, U.S. 3,568,167, proposes a storage information system by bleaching colour centres in alkali halides. Some degree of frequency domain storage is obtained by grinding together several materials each bleachable at different wavelengths. Electric fields are used to enhance the bleaching, that is, writing, on crystals cooled to 200 C. The patent to Schneider, U.S. 3,673,578, describes the use of homogeneous electric fields in conjunction with light to create and destroy F centres in alkali halides. This allows writing, erasing and reading with a single wavelength. However, both of these patents utilize electric fields that are homogeneous and these homogeneous electric fields are not used to increase storage density, but rather to aid the writing process. Summary of the Invention It is a primary object of this invention to provide a method of forming an improved photochemical holeburning memory. It is another object of this invention to provide a method of increasing the storage capacity of a photochemical holeburning memory. These and other objects are accomplished by a method of burning holes while using an inhomogeneous electric field in a photochemical hole burning memory. When the electric field is changed, the entire spectrum of the memory is swept clean without losing the information so that a new set of holes can be burned thereby increasing the storage capacity. A new set of holes can be burned whenever a different electric field is used. Restoring the original electric field regenerates the holes burned at that field. An example involves the use of colour centres in NaF having a spectral hole burned therein with a laser at an optical frequency at 5770 or 6070A zero phonon lines at a voltage of 50 volts and subsequently at a voltage of 100 volts. Other objects of this invention will be apparent from the following detailed description, reference being made to the following drawings in which specific embodiments of the invention are shown. Brief Description of the Drawings FIGURE 1 illustrates the line profile curves A, B, C, D, E and F resulting from the steps of this process. Description of the Preferred Embodiment The method employed in this invention is applicable to photochemical hole burning memories of the type described in the Castro et al U.S. Patent 4,101,976 which is incorporated herewith by reference thereto. In this type of optical data storage system, the data is stored in the frequency dimension to provide a third dimension. Photochemical hole burning memories employ a storage material which is a layer or block of a material which is adapted to undergo a photo induced reaction upon exposure to light. The photo induced reaction would be a photo chemical reaction or a photochromic reaction, that is, a light induced change in the material optical properties. Examples are suitable materials such asNaF or LiF which have colour centres. Most materials that have a Stark effect, i.e., the optical transition frequency in the material depends on the electric field applied, are suitable materials. These materials must exhibit inhomogeneous absorption line broadening.Curve A of Figure 1 shows a section of such an inhomogeneously broadened absorption line. In accordance with this invention, the material is placed in an inhomogeneous electric field. This may be accomplished by applying a fixed voltage to electrodes placed on opposite sides of the material.Examples of voltages that may be applied are 0 to 500 volts depending upon the electrode geometry and the optical spot size. Curve A shows the absorption spectrum over a frequency range while a voltage V1 is applied. The voltage V1 may, for example, be 50 volts. The next step of the invention is to expose the material to a laser having a frequency in, for example, ultra violet, visible or infrared radiation and lying inside the inhomogeneous line to burn a hole M as shown in Curve B. After the hole at M frequency has been burned or created, the laser is adjusted so that laser light having a frequency N enters the material to burn a hole N as shown in Figure B. Similarly, a hole P is burned in the material at a frequency P. The three holes Ml, N and P represent three separate bits of data. In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the next step is to apply a different voltage V2, for example 100 volts, to the material to give a curve as shown for Curve C. While the inhomogeneous field provided by applying the voltage V2 to the electrode is about said material, a laser having a frequency R and later a frequency S strikes the material to form holes R and S as shown in Curve D. The voltage is then changed back to V1 as shown by Curve E. The data bits represented by M , N and P may be read while the voltage is at V1. When the voltage is changed to V2, the data bits at R and S frequencies may be read. Many different values of the voltage can be used and this provides as an additional dimension to those of space and frequency with an increase in information storage capacity. This process has a high signal to noise ratio. A small fraction of the inhomogeneous line, for example, about 1 , is used up in burning a pattern of holes at a given value of an applied voltage. Thus basically the embodiment of the invention makes use of a photoreactive material in which different reactions can be induced, at the same recording spot or location in the material, depending on the frequency of the illuminating or exposure light beam for recording, the different reactions being inhomogenous and being detectable i.e. read, by directing light at the recording spot at successively different frequencies in the possible exposure band and detecting absorption characteristics of the material e.g. by determining its entire absorption characteristic. The invention is implemented using a photoreactive material which is photo electro reactive in that the different reactions are different and inhomogenous depending not only on the frequency of the recording light beam, but also on the electric field to which the material is subjected. Thus at one spot on the recording material, several digital data bits can be recorded using one electric field, and several further and different bits can be recorded using a second electric field.
