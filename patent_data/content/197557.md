# SWITCH ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
A switch assembly coprises a switch mechanism, a latch mechanism having a latch lever and mounted operatively engageably with the switch mechanism, a first contact operated in response to movement of the lever of the latch mechanism relative to the switch mechanism into a latched state, a second contact operated in response to the release of the latch lever from the latched state, whereby the timing at which the first contact is operated is deviated from that of the second contact.
