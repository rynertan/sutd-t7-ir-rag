# TUBULAR CAPACITOR

## Abstract
A tubular capacitor is formed as follows. A ceramic tube comprising an outer ceramic cylinder 22, 22 , 37, 61 and a plurality of radial walls 24, 38 41, 62 69 is extruded. The extruded body may also include a second ceramic cylinder 23, 23 coaxial with the first. The one or more cylinders and the radial walls form a plurality of longitudinal passages. After the extrudate is fired and cut, the surfaces of the passages and the remaining surfaces of the cylinder or cylinders are metallized. Selected regions of metalization are removed to form discrete electrodes 25 27, 25 27 , 43 46, 72 79 . Two sets of electrodes are respectively connected to first and second electrical termination means 49, 50, 80 .
