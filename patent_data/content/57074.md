# Time code signal generators.

## Abstract
A time code signal generator for a video tape recorder comprises a time code generator 20 for generating a first time code signal in response to a vertical synchronizing signal, a memory 14 for storing a second time code signal reproduced from the video tape recorder, a circuit 15 for comparing the first time code signal with the second time code signal to produce an inconformity signal, a counter 17 for counting the inconformity signal, and a switch 24 for supplying the second time code signal in response to an output of the counter 17 .
