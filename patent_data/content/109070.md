# MOS type semiconductor device.

## Abstract
A MOS type semiconductor device with a gate protecting circuit 23₁ for protecting an internal circuit 22 is disclosed. Distances D2, D3 between the diffusion layer 29₁C, 29₁R in the gate protecting circuit and the diffusion layers 24, 25, 27, 28 in the internal circuit is selected at such values that minori ty carriers derived from the diffusion layer in the internal circuit are prevented from reaching a depletion layer in the gate pro tecting circuit which is caused by the impression thereto of a surge voltage, and that are at least ten times a predetermined minimum distance D1 each separating the adjacent diffusion layers of those 24, 25, 27 .
