# Biologically active peptides structurally related to regions within growth hormones.

## Abstract
Disclosed are novel synthetic peptides having primary structural homology to a continuous sequence of amino acid residues of human growth hormone in a region spanning positions thirty two to forty six hGH₃₂ ₄₆ , or deletion pep tide . In preferred forms, peptides of the invention com prehend duplicate portions i.e., sequence fragments of hGH₃₂ ₄₆ stereochemical analogs and fragment analogs of hGH₃₂ ₄₆ including one or more amino acid residues in D isomeric configuration and, interspecies analogs and fragment analogs of hGH₃₂ ₄₆ including one or more non homologous amino acid residues duplicating variant re sidues present in corresponding positions in corresponding regions of heterologous species growth hormones. Peptides of the invention are administered to mammals contem poraneously with exogenous insulin to generate hypogly cemic effects greater than available through administration of insulin alone. A presently preferred heptapeptide has the sequence, NH₂Glu Glu Ala Tyr Ile Pro Lys COOH, and has insulinpotentiating activity greater than hGH₃₂ ₄₆.
