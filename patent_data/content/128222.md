# ROTARY HEAD CYLINDER WITH FLUID BEARING.

## Abstract
A rotary head apparatus, which is employed in a video tape recorder and has a dynamic pressure type fluid bear ing, is provided with cylindrical rotary transformers 31, 32 which are coaxial with a fixed shaft 22 , thereby to reduce the size of the apparatus. Moreover, of the two herringbone groups 26A, 26B provided on the fixed shaft 22 , the group 26A closer to the free end is made larger in size than the one closer to the fixed end, thereby giving a stable rotational performance even when the apparatus is inclined.
