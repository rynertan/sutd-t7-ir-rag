# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR HIGH DENSITY WIRE HARNESS MANUFACTURE

## Abstract
Apparatus and method for the assembly of wire harnesses consists of two jaw like parts which receive and guide a wire to an assembly point. Each half of the assembly tool is double ended, so that the wire may be inserted from either the left or right. The wire feed system includes a wire tensioning and cen tering tool mounted on the end effector and pneumatically driven wire feed system. A stationary clamp initially receives the terminated wire from the wire feed system and positions it for acquisition by the gripper and at least one and preferably several alignment fixtures disposed on various points of a wire harness formboard. The alignment fixtures are adapted to receive the contact end gripper thereinto for the proper align ment of the contact with the gripper prior to insertion of the contact into a connector. The technique enables the manufac ure of high density wire harnesses effectively and efficiently.
