## Description
DISAZO ORANGE DYES FOR NYLON This invention relates to a new group of compounds that are useful in the dyeing of polyamides, such as nylon, silk and wool, in orange hues. The new dyes are compatible with several acid blue dyes and several acid red dyes that are commercially important as dyes for nylon. They are particularly suited for use as the 11yellow dye component in trichromatic systems for dyeing polyamide carpeting and other fabrics. They are also relatively inexpensive to make, and they have outstanding application and fastness properties. Other aspects of the invention are concerned with a method of making the new compounds and with a methed of dyeing polyamides with said compounds.Still other aspects of the invention are directed to the novel dyed polyamides resulting from the use of the new compounds as dyes The new compounds have the structure EMI1.1 wherein R is H, CH3, CH2CH3, C6H5, or CH2OH R1 is H or R16, whereinR16 is CH3, cH2CH3, CH2CH2OH, EMI1.2 EMI1.3 SO2 lower alkyl, S02 phenyl, or SO2 phenyl substituted with one or more halo, lower alkyl, or lower alkoxy groups R2 is H , lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, or C1 R3 is H, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, or C1 R4 is H, CH31 CH2CH3, orEMI2.1 Rll is H or lower alkyl M is H, Li, Na, K, NH4, or N R5 4, wherein R5 is H orEMI2.2 R6 is H, CH3, or CH2CH3 n is 1, 2, 3, or 4 and OR1 is ortho or para to the azo linkage, and when OR1 is ortho to the azo linkage, a blocking group such as lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, or C1 must be present para to the azo group. Throughout the following description and in the claims, unless the text clearly shows a different meaning intended, the terms R, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R11, R161 M and n have the same meanings as in Structure I above. Where the terms lower alkyl or lower alkoxy are used, they refer to alkyl and alkoxy compounds having one to four carbon atoms. The Structure I compounds wherein R1 is H, to wit EMI2.3 are useful as dyes for imparting orange hues to polyamide fibers however, they generally exhibit some sensitivity to alkali. The Structure Ia compounds are also useful as pre cursors for making a large number of similarly structured compounds that have highly useful working properties when used as dyes for nylon and other polyamide fibers. These related compounds have enhanced alkali stability and are produced by end capping the Structure Ia compounds by any of the many well known end capping techniques for example, by replacing the terminal phenolic hydrogen with an alkyl, hydroxyalkyl, alkyl sulfonyl or aryl su lfonyl group to reduce alkali sensitivity and otherwise vary the working properties of the precursor compounds.For economic reasons, some of the preferred alkyl, hydroxyalkyl, alkyl sulfonyl, and aryl sulfonyl groups are the R16 substituents they provide compounds of Structure Ib EMI3.1 The Structure Ia compounds are prepared by sequep tidal diazotization and coupling reactions, utilizing synthesis routes and techniques that are well understood in the art. More specifically, they are prepared by diazotizing a monosulfophenylamine having the desired R3 substitution coupling the resulting diazonium salt with a phenylamine which is capable of coupling in the para position in relation to its amino group and which has the structure EMI4.1 rediazotizing the monoazo compound coupling the diazonium salt pf the monoazo compound with a phenol having the de siredR2 and R11 substitutions.The Structure Ib compounds are made from the Structure Ia compounds by reaction with a reagent capable of providing the desired R16 substitution.The Structure I compounds can be formed as or converted to the desired salt form. For example, conversion to the free sulfonic acid form may be accomplished by treatment with a strong acid this form may then be converted by treatment with a suitable base to give the desired M substitution. As is also well known1 in those cases where theStructure II phenylamine is insufficiently reactive to produce high yields of monoazo coupling when reacted with the monosulfophenylamine diazonium salt, the coupling reactivity may be enhanced by first converting the Structure II phenylamine to its corresponding methane sulfonate derivative by reacting it in a conventional manner with formaldehyde bisulfite adduct and, following the first coupling, by removing the methane sulfonate group by basic hydrolysis to regen erase the primary amino group Suitable monosulfophenylamines for use in producing the new Structure I compounds include, but are not limited to 2 aminobenzene sulfonic acid, 3 aminobenzene sulfonic acid, 4 aminobenzene sulfonic acid, 2 aminotoluene 5 sulfonic acid, 2 aminotoluene 4 sulfonic acid, 4 aminotoluene 3 sulfonic acid, 5 aminotoluene 2 sulfonic acid, 4 aminotoluene 2 sulfonic acid, 3 amino 4 methoxybenzene sulfonic acid, 4 amino 3 methoxybenzene sulfonic acid1 5 amino 2 methoxybenzene sulfonic acid, 3 amino 4 chlorobenzene sulfonic acid, 5 amino 2 chlorobenzene sulfonic acid, and 2 amino 5 chlorobenzene sulfonic acid.

Insofar as we have been able to determine, many of the foregoing Structure II phenylamines have not heretofore been used as intermediates in the making of disazo dyes.Some in their own right are new and novel compounds. These phenyl amines may be synthesized by alkylating an appropriately substituted nitrophenol with a suitable alkylene oxide or alkylene chlorohydrin, followed by reduction of the nitro group to form the free primary amine, or by alkylating an appropriately substituted acetamidophenol with a suitable alkylene oxide or alkylene chlorohydrin, followed by acid hydrolysis to form the free primary amine see, e.g., Chemical Abstracts, 51, 8724a b . Suitable phenols for use in producing the new Struc ture Ia compounds include, but are not limited to phenol, 2 methyiphenol, 3 methylphenol, 4 methylphenol 2 methoxyphenol, 3 methoxyphenol, 4 methoxyphenol, 2 chiorophenol, 3 chlorophenol, 4 chlorophenol, di lower alkyl phenols, lower alkyl chlorophenols, di lower alkoxy phenols, and lower alkoxy chlorophenols. Suitable end cappiny reagents for making tulle newStructure Ib compounds include, but are not limited to, dimethyl sulfate, dimethyl sulfate, methyl chloride, methyl bromide, methyl iodide, ethylene oxide, ethyl chloride, ethyl bromide, ethyl iodide, propylene oxide, l chloro 2propanol, butylene oxide, styrene oxide, ethylene chlorohydrin, propylene chlorohydrin, butylene chlorhydrin, glycidol, glycerol monochlorohydrin, methane sulfonyl chloride, benzene sulfonyl chloride, toluene sulfonyl chloride, and chlorobenzene sulfonyl chloride. Of the Structure I compounds, those that have theStructure IcEMI9.1 wherein R1 2 is H or CH3 R13 is H or CH3 R14 is H, CH3, or CH2CH3 andEMI9.2 are especially well suited for use in accordance with this invention. The Structure Ic compounds can be inexpensively made and exhibit outstanding working and fastness properties. Depending on the particular solubility characteristics desired, the Structure I compounds can be made as the sodium, potassium, lithium, or N Rg 4 salt forms such as the ammonium, alkanolammonium and polyalkanolammonium salts by various well known techniques, which involve having the desired M ion or ions present during the various coupling and or neutralization reactions employed in making the compound. The alkali metal ions may be provided by their hydroxides, carbonates, bicarbonates and the like. The ammonium, alkanolammonium, and polyalkanolammonium ions can be provided by the use of ammonia , alkanolamines and polyalkanolamines.Examples of suitable alkanolamines and polyalkanol amines include mono , di and triethanolamines mono , di and tripropanolamines. mono , di and tributanolamines and their ethoxylated, propoxylated and butoxylated derivatives, as well as mixtures of these derivatives. Amines from which such salts are derived may be readily prepared by reacting ammonia, mono , di or trialkanolamines with ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide or mixtures thereof.Any of the salt forms can be converted to their free acids by treatment in a conventional manner with a strong acid and filtering the free acid can be converted to any of the various salts by neutralization with a suitable base The sodium, lithium, ammonium and triethanolammonium salts and the trisethoxylated triethanolammonium salts having the structure EMI11.1 where m, p, and q are 0, 1, 2 or 3 and m p q 3 are the preferred salt forms because of economic considerations and the solubility properties imparted thereby. The Structure I compounds impart orange hues to polyamide fibers from aqueous dye baths, and because of their compatibility with certain acid red dyes and certain acid blue dyes that are readil y available and widely used in the dyeing of polyamide textile fibers they are well suited for use in combination or trichromatic dye systems for the dyeing of synthetic polyamide fibers particularly synthetic polyamide carpeting that enable various hues and shades to be obtained by varying the concentration of two or three different colored dye components one being a red dye component, one being a blue. dye component, and one being a yellow dye component. In compound dye systems, in addition to imparting the usual desirable fastness properties such as wet fast ness, light fastness and stability to deleterious atmospheric gases , it is essential that the various dye components used in the system be compatible from a performance standpoint. Specifically, the color components should poss ess substantially the same aqueous solution stability, substantially the same dyeing rates, and substantially the same migration characteristics, so as to provide unifonn strike, exhaustion and build up under the particular time and temperature conditions encountered in the dyeing operation usually from room temperature to 1000C .Color components meeting these characteristics permit the desired hue to build up uniformly on tone and enable the dyer to have good control over the dyeing process at all stages thereof. As used in this application, and unless a contrary intent is evident from the context, the term dyeing is used in its broadest sense, to cover the coloring of the fiber by the application of a color component from an aqueous solution, and includes coloration by printing with aqueous print pastes as well as by conventional dyeing tech niques. In addition, the terms yellow dye or yellow color component are used to include compounds that are sold commercially as yellow dyes and as orange dyes and include the compounds of this invention. Of the thousands of known acid dyes that are capable of dyeing synthetic polyamide fibers, relatively few dye combinations have the requisite compatibility from a performance standpoint to enable their effective use in trichromatic systems for dyeing synthetic polyamide fibers from aqueous dye baths, so as to provide uniform strike, buildup, and exhaustion of color during the dyeing operation and to reproduce repetitively uniform dyeings.The finding and selecting of compatible red, yellow, and blue dyes is also greatly aggravated because, under the present state of the art, persons skilled in the art cannot with certainty predict the degree to which structural alterations of a dye will influence a dye s performance, nor can they predict with certainty how an incompatible dye should be structur ally modified to render it compatible with the other color component or components of the system. Accordingly, one of the primary objectives of the present invention is to provide a new and relatively inexpensive group of azo compounds i.e., the aforementioned Structure I compounds that are capable pf functioning as acid dyes for polyamide fibers, imparting orange hues thereto when applied from aqueous dyebaths. It is also an objective of the present invention to provide a new system of compatible dyes that includes an acid red dye component, a n acid blue dye component, and an acid yellow dye component that can be used in rapid, continuous dyeing applications where readily controlled dyeing is desired, such as in continuous printing, foam dyeing and spray dyeing of carpets, and particularly in applications where high speed, computer controlled equipment is employed. It is a further objective of the invention to provide such a system that can also be used in exhaust dyeing, such as in becks. It is a still further objective of the invention tq provide new trichromatic dye systems which utilize the new orange compounds of this invention as the acid yellow dye components and which, from selectively within the group of new orange compounds, provide performance compatibility that permits use in trichromatic dye systems having different strike rates. Because of their somewhat different performance properties, particularly their strike rates, the Structure I compounds wherein R1 is a lower alkyl group such as C3 or CH2CH3 and those wherein R1 is an alkanol group such as CH2CH2OH,EMI14.1 are not uniformly compatible with the same acid blue dyes and the same acid red dyes in trichromatic dyeing systems. The Structure Ic dyes in which R15 is a lower aikyl group are faster striking than those in which R15 is an alkanol group, the remainder of the molecules being identical. Thus, where R15 in a Structure Ic compound is CH3 or CR2CH3 a subgroup hereinafter identified as R8 , the compounds of Structures Id and Ie EMI14.2 are compatible in performance with the faster striking acid red dyes, such asEMI14.3 and the faster striking blue dyes, such asEMI15.1 The Structure Ic compounds identical to the above dyes of Structures Id and Ie, with the exception that R15 is one of the alkanol substituents hereinafter Rg substituents specified in Structure Ic,EMI15.2 exhibit a comparatively slower rate of strike and are better suited for use with slower striking acid red dyes, such asEMI15.3 and slower striking acid blue dyes, such asEMI16.1 Thus, by varying the structure of the compounds of this invention, it is possible to make orange dye components that have very desirable working properties and which exhibit a wide range of strike rates, so that they can be used in trichromatic systems in which the dyes will be compatible in performance with desired acid red and acid blue dye combinations. As is generally known in the art, the water solubility of an acid dye may vary according to the identity of theM substituent. Usually when M is alkanolammonium or polyalkanolammonium, the dye possesses greater water solubility than when M is an alkali metal. The alkanolammonium or polyalkanolammonium salt forms can be advantageously employed when storage stable, high concentration aqueous liquid forms of the dyes are to be produced. The concentrations of the color components in the trichromatic system can be varied in a conventional manner in order to develop the desired hue in the dyeing. The following examples will serve to describe the preparation of the Structure I compounds, demonstrate the compatibility of the color components used in the trichromatic dye systems of the invention, and illustrate the use of said systems in the dyeing of polyamide carpet fibers.In the examples, parts and percentages are by weight and temperatures are given in degrees Centigrade, unless otherwise stated. Example 1 A solution of 17.3 parts of sulfanilic acid in 4 parts of sodium hydroxide and 100 parts of water was diazotized directly at 0 5 C in the usual, known manner by adding 25 parts of concentrated hydrochloric acid followed by 7 parts of sodium nitrite dissolved in 20 parts of water.After addition of sulfamic acid to remove the slight excess of nitrous acid, the diazo slurry was added to a cold 100 C solution of 18.1 parts of 1 2 amino 4 methylphenoxy 2 propanol in 100 parts of water and 12 parts of concentrated hydrochloric acid.

The slurry was acidified with 25 parts of concentrated hydrochloric acid and then treated with a solution of 7 parts of sodium nitrite dissolved in 20 parts of water. The precipitated diazonium salt was isolated by filtration after stirring at 30 350C for two hours. The filter cake obtained was added to a cold 50C solution of 10.6 parts of 85 phenol in 100 parts of water and 6 parts of sodium hydroxide. After two hours stirring, the pli was adjusted to 9.2 with hydrochloric acid, and 15 parts of propylene oxide were added. The mixture was heated to and maintained at gentle reflux for four hours. The resulting solution was treated with 1 part diatomaceous earth as a filter aid and filtered. Spray drying of the filtrate yielded 40 parts of a dark orange, water soluble powder having the structureEMI19.1 This powder dyed nylon carpet fibers from aqueous dyebaths in bright orange shades having excellent light fastness.
