## Description
BORON CONTAINING ESTERS, THEIR PREPARATION AND USE AS ANTIOXIDANTS This invention relates to boron containing esters, their preparation and use as antioxidants. Boronated phenols made by the reaction of various esters of boron acids with phenolic compounds are known antioxidants. A variety of such reaction products are described in U.S. Patent Specification No. 3,014,061.Other such disclosure appears in U.S. Patent SpecificationsNos. 2,813,830 3,347,793 3,509,054 3,359,298 and 3,356,707. Although such prior art generically describes various phenolic esters of many types of boroniacids, it fails to describe the reaction products of tri sec C4 12 alkyl orthoborates with 4,4 methylenebis 2, 6 di tert butyl phenol . It has now been discovered that the narrow class of reaction products of 4,4 methylenebis 2 ,6 di tert butyl phenol made using tri sec C4 12 alkyl orthoborates are extremely effective antioxidants and surprisingly have been found to be much more resistant to hydrolysis when compared to reaction products made from tri n alkyl orthoborates as described in the prior art. The invention provides a 4,4 methylenebis 2,6 ditert butyl phenol mono or di di sec C4 12 alkyl orthoborate ester. The invention also includes a process for preparing an ester of the invention which comprises reacting 4,4 methylenebis 2 ,6 di tert butyl phenol with a tri sec C4 12 alkyl orthoborate. A preferred embodiment of this invention is a boronated phenolic antioxidant having improved hydrolytic stability, said antioxidant being the product made by a process comprising reacting at elevated temperature a one mole part of 4,4 methylenebis 2,6 di tert butyl phenol and b 0.5 5 mole part of tri sec alkyl orthoborate wherein said sec alkyl group contains 4 12 carbon atoms. The compound, 4,4 methylenebis 2,6 di tertbutyl phenol , is a well known commercial antioxidant herein sometimes designated 4,4 MBTP . Only reaction products made using sec C4 12 alkyl orthoborates are within the scope of the present invention The invention does not encompass metaborates, pyroborates or esters of boronic or borinic acid. Also, the invention is limited to the aliphatic C4 12 secondary alkyl esters. The invention is based on the discovery that the reaction products made from sec C4 12 alkyl orthoborates are not only extremely effective antioxidants but they have unexpectedly been found to have many times the hydrolytic stability compared to the isomeric n alkyl esters. Examples of sec alkyl orthoborate esters include tri sec butyl orthoborate, tri sec pentyl orthoborate, tri 1,3 dimethylbutyl orthoborate, di sec butyl secpentyl orthoborate, tri 1,3 dimethyl pentyl orthoborate, tri l methyl nonyl orthoborate, di l methyl undecyl sec butyl orthoborate, and the like. Highly preferred sec alkyl orthoborates are those in which the alkyl group is linear from end to end but bonded to the orthoborate group at a secondary carbon atom in other words, a methylene carbon atom in the linear chain somewhere between the two end methyl groups. Examples of these are l methyl propyl sec butyl , l methyl butyl, l ethyl propyl, l methyl pentyl, l ethyl butyl, l methyl hexyl, l ethyl pentyl, l propyl butyl, l methyl heptyl, l ethyl hexyl, l methyl undecyl, l ethyl decyl, and the like. Of this highly preferred class, the most preferred orthoborate is tri sec butyl orthoborate. The mole ratio of tri sec alkyl orthoborate to 4,4 methylenebis 2,6 di tert butyl phenol can vary over a wide range. A useful range is about 0.5 6 moles of tri sec alkyl orthoborate per mole of 4,4 methylenebis 2,6 di tert butyl phenol . A more preferred range is from 1 1 to 3 1. The antioxidants are made by forming a reaction mixture of the tri sec alkyl orthoborate and 4,4 methylenebis 2,6 di tert butyl phenol and heating this mixture while distilling out displaced sec alkanol. The reaction should be conducted at a temperature high enough to cause the phenol hydroxyl to displace a sec alkyl group from the orthoborate ester and to cause the displaced sec alcohol to distill out but not so high as to cause decomposition of the reactants or products. A useful temperature range in which to experiment is from l50 3000C. When using tri sec butyl orthoborate, the preferred temperature range is 200 275OC. The transesterification reaction can be catalyzed by a small amount of an acidic material.This includes sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, methane sulfonic acid, p toluene sulfonic acid, and the like.The preferred catalysts are the lower fatty acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, and the like. The most preferred catalyst is acetic acid. Only a catalytic amount of catalyst is required. A useful catalyst range is 0.02 0.2 weight percent based upon total reaction mass. The principal components in the reaction mixture are 4,4 metbylenebis 2,6 di tert butyl phenol mono di sec C4 12 alkyl orthoborate ester and 4,4 methylenebis 2,6 di tert butyl phenol di di sec C4 12 alkyl orthoborate ester together with varied amounts of unreacted 4,4 methylenebis 2,6 di tertbutyl phenol . Analysis of products made from tri secbutyl orthoborate show them to contain 0 50 weight percent 4,4 methylenebis 2,6 di tert butyl phenol , 25 75 weight percent 4,4 methylenebis 2,6 di tertbutyl phenol mono di sec butyl orthoborate ester and 10 75 weight percent 4,4 methylenebis 2,6 di tert butyl phenol di di sec butyl orthoborate ester. In order to meet emission standards, most present day automobiles in the U.S. include a catalytic converter in the exhaust system to lower hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide content of engine exhaust gas.Such catalysts are expected to remain effective for at least 50,000 miles. Certain chemicals in the exhaust gas can cause premature deactivation of the catalyst. One such chemical is lead or lead compounds in the exhaust gas. To prevent this, catalyst equipped cars are required to operate on lead free gasoline. It has been found that additives in the crankcase lubricating oil can also find their way into the exhaust gas. One such additive is zinc dialkyldithiophosphate ZDDP . These additives cause phosphorus compounds to be emitted in the engine exhaust. Such phosphorus compounds can cause catalyst deterioration. Thus far, it has not been found practical to remove ZDDP from the crankcase oil becauseZDDP is required both for antiwear and antioxidant protection. The amount of ZDDP in the oil required to provide adequate protection is generally an amount which is sufficient to impart at least 0.14 weight percent phosphorus to the oil. At this concentration, catalyst deactivation due to phosphorus can occur.There is a greater incentive to decrease the amount of phosphorus in motor oil while at the same time providing an adequate level of antiwear and antioxidant protection for the engine. In another preferred embodiment of the invention the amount of ZDDP in crankcase lubricating oil formulated for use in the crankcase of an internal combustion engine is reduced to a level which provides a low phosphorus lubricating oil composition containing only from 0.05 to 0.11 weight percent phosphorus. The low phosphorus formulation is made possible by including in the oil an antioxidant amount of the previously described new antioxidants, preferably the reaction product of 4,4 methylenebis 2 ,6 di tert butyl phenol and a tri sec C alkyl orthoborate. In this 4 12 embodiment the most preferred additive is the reaction product of 4,4 methylenebis 2,6 di tert butyl phenol and tri sec butyl orthoborate. The following Examples show how the present additives are made EXAMPLE 1 In a reaction vessel was placed 127 grams 0.3 moles of 4,4 MBTP and 234 grams 1.02 moles of tri sec butyl orthoborate.

It was then vacuum stripped at 0.408 gm cm2 Hg for one hour at a pot temperature of 182 205OC. The product analyzed 1.4 weight percent boron and by HPLC contained 26 weight percent 4,4 MBTP, 49 weight percent mono di sec butyl orthoborate ester of 4,4 MBTP and 17 weight percent di di sec buty1 orthoborate ester of 4,4 MBTP. EXAMPLE 5 In a reaction vessel was placed 140 grams 0.33 moles of 4,4 MBTP and 154 grams 0.66 moles tri sec butyl orthoborate. The mixture was stirred under nitrogen and heated at 25OOC. for seven hours while distilling out sec butanol. Residual volatiles were then stripped at 0.408 gm cm2 Hg while heating from 155 0C. to 225 0C. over a 0.7 hour period. The product analyzed 1.7 weight percent boron and contained 15 weight percent 4,4 MBTP, 46 weight percent mono di sec butyl orthoborate ester of 4,4 MBTP and 23 weight percent di di sec butyl orthoborate ester of 4,4 MBTP. EXAMPLE 6 In a reaction vessel was placed 140 grams of 4,4 MBTP and 77 grams tri sec butyl orthoborate. This was stirred and heated under nitrogen for 6 hours at sec butanol. It was then stripped at 0.408 gm cm2 Hg for 1.2 hours while heating from 1130. to 235 0C.

EXAMPLE 7 In a reaction vessel was placed 100 grams 4,4 MBTP, 82 grams tri sec butyl orthoborate and three drops of acetic acid. The mixture was stirred under nitrogen for 2.5 hours at 230 2700C. while distilling out sec butanol. The product was then stripped at 0.408 gm cm2 Hg for 0.7 hours while heating from 900C. to 195 0C. The product analyzed 1.6 weight percent boron. EXAMPLE 8 This Example was conducted the same as the previous Example except the reaction time was reduced to two hours while heating from 2000 to 2600C EXAMPLE 9 In a reaction vessel was placed 100 grams 0.24 moles 4,4 MBTP, 109 grams 0.47 moles tri sec butyl orthoborate and 0.04 weight percent acetic acid catalyst.

It analyzed 2.1 weight percent boron and contained 4 percent 4,4 MBTP, 35 percent 4,4 MBTP mono di secbutyl orthoborate ester and 58 percent 4,4 MBTP di di sec butyl orthoborate ester. Antioxidant Effectiveness Tests were conducted to determine the antioxidant effectiveness of the additive. The first series of tests are referred to as Oxidation CorrosionTests. In these tests the additive is dissolved in a typical unformulated SAE 20 lubricating oil to which has also been added an oil soluble oxidation catalyst 0.005 weight percent Fe as iron naphthenate . A clean weighed copper lead bearing is also placed in the oil.The oil sample is heated to 1600C. and air is bubbled through the oil at a rate of 0.2 liters per minute for 18 hours. Following this, the viscosity and acid number of the oil are measured and the bearing is weighed to determine weight loss. Also, the oil is visually rated on a scale from A clear to E heavy sludge . The following results were obtained TABLE 1 Percent Acid Bearing Viscosity Number Weight VisualAdditive Increase Increase Loss mg Rating 4,4 MBTP 0.75 wt. percent 250 . 12.3 135 CPresent antioxidantl, 4 1.2 1 B 0.75 wt. percent 1 Reaction product of 4,4 MBTP and tri sec butyl orthoborate A second test was conducted. This was the industry standard L 38 test in which an engine is operated under prescribed conditions. The crankcase oil is a non additive lubricating oil except for the additive under test which was present at 1 weight percent. Every 10 hours the engine is stopped and the oil analyzed and the bearing weighed. The following table gives the results of the L 38 test TABLE II Bearing Weight Acid No. Percent Time Loss mga Increase Visc.Increase3 hrs.

These results show that the present additives are not only effective as antioxidants but provide a high degree of protection against bearing weight loss.Hyrdrolytic Stability A very important property of the present additives is their hydrolytic stability. Without this the additives could not endure in an environment where moisture is present such as in an engine crankcase. The hydrolytic stability was measured by dissolving the test additive in lubricating oil in an amount sufficient to impart 0.1 weight percent boron.Then, a 100 gram sample of the test oil was mixed with 25 grams water and the mixture stirred 42 hours while bubbling air through the mixture at a rate of 30 liters per hour. The stability of the product made with tri sec butyl orthoborate was compared to that of the isomer made with tri n butyl orthoborate. After the 42 hour mixing, the water phase was analyzed for boron.Results of the tests are reported in terms of percent boron extracted into the water phase. TABLE III Additive Percent Boron LossPrior art Normal Butyl Borate Reaction Product 82.0Present Sec butyl Borate Reaction Product 5.0 These results show that the present sec alkyl orthoborate derivatives have many times the hydrolytic stability of the n alkyl orthoborate derivatives. The antioxidants are added to the substrate to be protected in a small but effective amount sufficient to give the required degree of antioxidant protection.This can vary widely within the range of 0.005 10 weight percent. A preferred range is 0.05 5 weight percent. Good results are usually achieved using 0.1 3 weight percent. The antioxidant can be used in a broad range of organic material normally subject to gradual degradation in the presence of oxygen during use over an extended period. In other words, the organic compositions protected by the present antioxidants are the type in which the art recognizes the need for antioxidant protection and to which an antioxidant of some type is customarily added to obtain an extended service life. The oxidative degradation protected against is the slow gradual deterioration of the organic composition rather than, for example, combustion. In other words, the present additives are not flame retarding additives nor flame suppressing additives and the degradation protected against is not combustion but rather the gradual deterioration of the organic composition due to the effects of oxygen over an extended period of time. Examples of organic materials in which the additives are useful include petroleum oils and waxes such as solvent refined, midcontinent lubricating oil, microcrystalline wax, and Gulf coast lubricating oils, all of which are effectively stabilized. Hydrocarbons such as gasoline, kerosene, diesel fuel, fuel oil, furnace oil, and jet fuel are effectively protected. Likewise, synthetic hydrocarbon lubricants, for example, alpha decane trimer, polybutene lubricants, di and tri C12 30 alkylated benzene and naphthalene synthetic lubricants are likewise protected. The additives can be used to protect any of the many organic substrates to which an antioxidant is normally added. It can be used where economics permit to protect such substrates as asphalt, paper, fluorocarbons, such as teflon, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinylidene chloride, coumarone indene resins, polyvinyl ethers, polyvinylidene bromide, polyvinyl bromide, acrylonitrile vinyl bromide copolymer, vinyl butyral resins, silicones such as dimethylsilicone lubricants, phosphate lubricants such as tricresyl phosphate and the like. The additives are incorporated into the organic substrate in a small but effective amount so as to provide the required antioxidant protection. A useful range is from 0.005 to 10 weight percent, and a preferred range is from 0.05 to 5 weight percent. Methods of incorporating the additive into the substrate are well known. For example, if the substrate is liquid, the additive can be merely mixed into the substrate. Frequently the organic substrate is in solution and the additive is added to the solution and the solvent removed. Solid organic substrates can be merely sprayed with a solution of the additive in a volatile solvent. The additives are especially useful in mineral oil or in synthetic oils of viscosity suitable for use in the crankcase of an internal combustion engine. Crankcase lubricating oils have a viscosity up to about 0.056 m2 hr 80 SUS at 98.890C 2100F . Sometimes such motor oils are given a classification of both 15 17.780C 0 F and 98.890C 2100F , such as SAE 10W 40 or SAL 5W 30. Mineral oils include those of suitable viscosity refined from crude oil from all sources including Gulf coast, midcontinent, Pennsylvania, California, Alaska,North Sea, and the like. Various standard refinery operations can be used in processing the mineral oil. Synthetic oil includes both hydrocarbon synthetic oil and synthetic esters. Useful synthetic hydrocarbon oils include liquid polymers of alphaolefins having the proper viscosity. Especially useful are the hydrogenated liquid oligomers of C6 12 alphaolefins such as alpha decene trimer. Likewise, alkylbenzenes of proper viscosity can be used, such as didodecylbenzene. Useful synthetic esters include the esters of both monocarboxylic acid and polycarboxylic acid as well as monobydroxy alkanols and polyols. Typical examples are didodecyl adipate, trimethylol propane tripelargonate, pentaerythritol tetracaproate, di 2 ethylhexyl adipate, dilauryl sebacate and the like. Complex esters prepared from mixtures of monoand dicarboxylic acid and mono and polyhydroxyl alkanols can also be used. Blends of mineral oil with synthetic oil are particularly useful. For example, blends of 5 25 weight percent hydrogenated alpha decene trimer with 75 95 weight percent 30.1152 m2 hr at 37.3 C. mineral oil 150 SUS at i000F. results in an excellent lubricant. Likewise, blends of about 5 25 weight percent di 2 ethylhexyl adipate with mineral oil of proper viscosity results in a superior lubricating oil. Also, blends of synthetic hydrocarbon oil with synthetic esters can be used. Blends of mineral oil with synthetic oil are especially useful when preparing low viscosity oil e.g., SAE 5W 20 since they permit these low viscosities without contributing excessive volatility. The more preferred lubricating oil cmposition includes zinc dihydrocarbyldithiophosphate ZDDP in combination with the present additives. Both zinc dialkyldithiophosphates and zinc dialkaryldithiophosphates as well as mixed alkyl aryl ZDDP are useful. A typical alkyl type ZDDP contains a mixture of isobutyl and isoamyl groups. Zinc di nonylphenyl dithiophosphate is a typical aryl type ZDDP. The amount of ZDDP used has imparted as much as 0.14 weight percent or more phosphorus to the oil which can damage exhaust gas catalysts. With the use of the present additives, the amount of ZDDP can be reduced to supply less than 0.11 weight percent phosphorus to the oil. Another additive used in the oil compositions are the alkaline earth metal petroleum sulfonates or alkaline earth metal alkaryl sulfonates. Examples of these are calcium petroleum sulfonates, magnesium petroleum sulfonates, barium alkaryl sulfonates, calcium alkaryl sulfonates or magnesium alkaryl sulfonates. Both the neutral and the overbased sulfonates having base numbers up to about 400 can be beneficially used. These are used in an amount to provide 0.05 1.5 weight percent alkaline earth metal and more preferably 0.1 1.0 weight percent. In a most preferred embodiment the lubricating oil composition contains a calcium petroleum sulfonate or alkaryl e.g., alkylbenzene sulfonate. Viscosity index improvers can be included such as the polyalkylmethacrylate type or the ethylenepropylene copolymer type. Likewise, styrene diene VI improvers or styrene acrylate copolymers can be used.Alkaline earth metal salts of phosphosulfurized polyisobutylene are useful. The crankcase oils can also contain ashless dispersants such as the polyolefin substituted succinamides and succinimides of ethylene polyamines such as tetraethylene pentamine. The polyolefin succinic substituent is preferably a polyisobutene group having a molecular weight of from 800 to 5000.Such ashless dispersants are more fully described in U.S.Patent Specifications 1.oS. 3,171,us2 and 3,219raj6. Another useful class of ashless dispersants are the polyolefin succinic esters of mono and polyhydroxyl alcohols containing 1 to 40 carbon atoms.Such dispersants are described in U.S. Patent SpecificationsNos. 3,381,022 and3,522,179. Likewise, mixed ester amides of polyolefin substituted succinic acid made using alkanols, amines and or aminoalkanols represent a useful class of ashless dispersants. The succinic amide, imide and or ester type ashless dispersants may be boronoated by reaction with a boron compound such as boric acid. Likewise, the succinic amide, imide and or ester may be oxyalkylated by reaction with an alkylene oxide such as ethylene oxide or propylene oxide. Other useful ashless dispersants include theMannich condensation products of polyolefinsubtituted phenols, formaldehyde and polyethylene polyamine. Preferably, the polyolefin phenol is a polyisobutylene substituted phenol in which the polyisobutylene group has a molecular weight of from 800 to 5000. The preferred polyethylene polyamine is tetraethylene pentamine. Such Mannich ashless dispersants are more fully described in U.S. Patent Specificatiarls Nos. 3,3 S,972 3,413,347 3,442,808 3,448,047 3,539,633 3,591,598 3,600,372 3,634,515 3,697,574 3,703,536 3,704,308 3,725,480 3,726,882 3,736,357 3,751,365 3,756,953 3,793,202 3,798,165 3,798,247 and 3,803,039. The above Mannich dispersants can be reacted with boric acid to form boronated dispersants having improved corrosion properties.
