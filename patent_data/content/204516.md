# VISION SYSTEM FOR DISTINGUISHING TOUCHING PARTS

## Abstract
A practical vision system for controlling the positioning of a robot arm recognises and locates objects. The vision system 20, 30 processes binary images, but recognises objects based on boundary features such as lines, arcs, corners and holes instead of blob features such as area and best fit ellipse. Consequently, the vision system can process two common situations not handled by blob analysis merged blobs due to touching or overlapping parts and incomplete blobs due to low image contrast. The microprocessor based system is interfaced to the robot system and can recognize up to five parts per second.
