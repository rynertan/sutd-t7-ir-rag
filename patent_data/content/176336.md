## Abstract
It is known to evaluate the optical quality of aircraft canopies by having an operator view a pattern through the canopy and then make a subjective quality assessment dependent on the amount of distortion noticed. It has also been proposed to image a point light source through successively chosen portions of the canopy onto two linear imaging arrays arranged orthogonally to measure the deviation of the apparent position of the source caused by the canopy. Herein there is disclosed canopy testing using an area imaging device, eg a T.V. camera, to view a scene, a cross hatch pattern say, though the canopy. The viewed image is digitised and stored and a computer evaluates the target image by comparing the apparent positions of its features with their real positions and or by sensing deviations from straightness of the pattern lines. In a development, a polarimeter or polarization sensitive camera is used to test for hazing and curvature defects.
