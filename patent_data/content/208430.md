# A method and apparatus for performing variable length data read transactions.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for performing variable length data read transactions is presented in accordance with a pre ferred embodiment of the present invention. An input output I O device which performs variable length data read trans actions, such as one which includes a terminal, has associated with it a command linked list, located in system memory, in which a system processor or memory controller has placed command elements. For read transactions, each element typically specifies the place in system memory where data will be transferred, and the number of bytes of data to be transfer red. The I O device autonomously fetches elements on the linked list and executes them. As bytes are being transferred from the I O device to system memory a residual byte count is kept by the I O device. When the I O device has completed the data transfer, it may interrupt or otherwise provide the system processor with status information as to the data transfer. Additionally, the system processor may terminate a data transfer by sending a special flush command to the I O device. Upon receipt of the flush command, the I O device stops the data transaction, and returns to the system process the re sidual byte count. The residual byte count is used by the system processor to determine how many bytes of informa tion were transferred to system memory.
