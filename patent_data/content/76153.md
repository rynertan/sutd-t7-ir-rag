# TV RECEIVER

## Abstract
A monolithic circuit for a television receiver including an amplifier 1 receiving the r.f. input which passes via filter 2 and mixer 3 also receiving the output from local oscillator 4. The i.f. therefrom passes via filter 5 and i.f. amplifier 6 to the synchronous demodulator formed by filter 9 and mixer 8 whereby the demodulated video information is available for further use. A frequency discriminator formed by mixer 10 and delay 11, tracks any frequency variations to provide feedback control to oscillator 4 to compensate for tempera ture fluctuation. The elements 5, 9, 11 are fabricated using SAW techniques. The elements 1,3,4,6,8,10 are standard semiconductor configurations. Additional filtering after mixer 3 can be employed to separate the sound channel from the composite video and a further SAW delay line employed to produce the sound channel discriminator.
