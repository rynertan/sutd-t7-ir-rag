# Process for extruding polymers.

## Abstract
Making polymeric extrudates having a smooth surface by feeding a molten polymeric core material through a die cavity 15 wherein a portion of the wall of the die cavity 15 is a rigid microporous structure 12 located upstream from a narrowed flow passage 16 of the die cavity 15 , the microporous structure 12 having a substantially uniform pore size, simultaneously forcing under pressure through the microporous structure 12 about 0.03 10 , based on the total weight of the extrudate, of a low viscosity liquid to form a sheath on the molten polymeric core material thus displacing the polymeric core material before the resulting sheath core composite enters the narrowed flow passage 16 of the die cavity 15 said process conducted under conditions to produce a pressure drop across the micropo rous structure 12 of at least 0.10 MPa more than the pres sure applied on the polymeric core material.
