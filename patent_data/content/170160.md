# A FEEDING INSTALLATION FOR THE DAMPENING SOLUTION IN OFFSET PRINTING PROCESS

## Abstract
An installation for continuously feeding and renewing, into the dampening fountains of printing processes, a solution comprising water and chemical additives, compris es a tank containing a solution that can be automatically replenished as to the percentage of water and chemical additives, by means of probes and automated devices controlling the level and some of the main parameters of said solution, e.g. acidity and density. The solution is refrigerated by a suitable apparatus and is agitated and stirred continuously by means of a re circulation circuit which uses either ejectors or jet pumps having their suction conduits connected to the discharge ducts from the printing press fountains which receive a proportional quantity of solution from a feeding circuit comprising at least one pump and filters.
