## Description
Pyjamas provided with closeable openings for the body examination, particularly for bed ridden patients.The present invention refers to pyjamas particularly carried out for the use by bed ridden patients and provided with closeable openings to allow the body examination by the medical staff.It is known that the medical staff has to be able to repeatedly inspect the body of a bed ridden patient in a hospital in order to be able to carry out the operations requested on him or her by the medical science, as for instance auscultations, measurements of arterial and venous blood pressure, phleboclysises, electrocardigrams and the like.The common pyjamas, usually worn by the patients, confined to bed in hospitals, generally do not allow the direct body examination and they must be taken off the patient during the above cited operations, with serious drawbacks for the patient.From the patent N. 931,230, disposable white coats for hospital use are known, of the kind with closure by means of surfaces provided with a cohesive adhesive. Eow ever, such white coats do not resolve the drawbacks that happen with the known pyjamas, but on the contrary they add other ones.Infact, being designed to be thrown away after use, the above cited white coats are made from one sheet only, which does not make the examination of the top part of the trunk of the patient possible without slipping off the white coat, whereas on the contrary, in the case of usual pyjamas, composed of jacket and trousers, it is possible to slip off the jacket only with a certain ease.Furthermore, the execution in one sheet only, i. e.without seams, make it impossible to carry out the sleeves of the jacket and the legs of the trousers, and furthermore the very cheap material used for the disposable white coat appears rather shoddy and therefore irritating to wear.Such drawbacks have repercussions on the well being of the patient, who does not feel at his ease wearing such a kind of white coat.Furthermore, also the positions of the openings do not allow the facilitated body examination of the patient.Another disadvantage consists in that the cohesive adhesive, essential due to the kind of cheap material and due to the cheap execution of the white coat of the Patent N. 931,230, appears difficult in the use and poor in the effectiveness in the case of repeated closing and reopenings.According to the present invention, pyjamas, particularly for bed ridden patients, are characterized in that they comprise openable closing device, capable of being repeatedly opened and reclosed, and located so that, when opened, openings are available, capable of making the body examination of the patient by the medical staff easier.According to the needs, openable closing devices can be provided on one or both of the sides of the jacket, on one or both of the sides of the trousers, on one or both of the shoulders and on the top part of one or both of the sleeves, on the centre of the front part of the jacket, on the centre of the back part of the jacket, on the bottom part of one or both of the sleeves, at the crutch, and, or on the innermost part of the legs.In the following, the present invention will be further clarified from the description of one form of practical embodiment of the pyjamas for persons in bed, provided with closeable openings for the body examination, description made in a purely illustrative and not limitative way, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 shows the jacket of the present pyjamas for bed ridden patients, with the examination openings opened Figure 2 shows the trousers of the present pyjamas for bed ridden patients, with the examination openingsopened andFigure 3 shows the pyjamas of the present invention as worn, with the examination openings closed again.With reference to the accompanying drawings, and particularly to the figure 3 thereof, the pyjamas for bed ridden patients, according to the present invention, are generally shown as a whole by 10 and comprises a jacket 12, better shown in figure 1, and a pair of trousers 14, better shown in figure 2.The jacket 12 is formed in a traditional way and has two sleeves 16, 18, as well as a front part 20 and a back part 22. Furthermore, areas 24 and 26 are provided on the front part 20 and corresponding areas 28 and 30 on the back part 22, which are designed to cover the shoulders of the bed ridden patient.At the top sides of the sleeves 16 and 18 and at the top sides of the shoulder areas 24, 28, 26 and 30 openable closing devices are provided, indicated by 32 and 32 , 34 and 34 , 36 and 36 , 38 and 38 , respectively, as more clearly shown in figure 1.Also at the lateral side of the front part 20 there are openable closing devices, indicated by 40 and 42, and designed to cooperate with corresponding openable closing devices 40 and 42 , respectively.The trousers 14, also formed in a traditional way, have legs 42 and 46, as well as a front part 48 and a back part 50. At the lateral edges of the front portion 48 openable closing devices are provided, indicated with 52 and 54, and designed to cooperate with corresponding openable closing devices 52 and 54 , respectively, provided on the lateral edges of the back part 50.The present pyjamas are worn by the patients with the openable closing devices arranged in their closed position, i. e. with the shoulder devices 36 and 36 and, or 38 and 38 partially or totally opened to make the passing of the head of the patient easier.When an examination by the medical staff, or the treatment with particular therapies or the taking of measurements, is to be carried out, the body parts to inspect can be easily exposed by opening one or some of the closing devices.For instance, if a measurement of pressure is to be carried out, or a phleboclysis is to be made, by open ing the closing device 32, 32 or 34, 34 of one of the two sleeves of the jacket 12, one can easily reach the corresponding arm of the patient, without compelling him or her to slip off his ór her jackèt. Similarly, the legs can easily be inspected by opening the closing devices 52, 52 or 54, 54 , located at the legs of the trousers 14, whereas the chest or the back of the patient can be easily reached by opening the closing devices 40, 40 and 42, 42 , located at the lateral edges of the jacket 12. The closing devices are preferably comprised of a strip of fibrous material anda strip of bristle like material formed like very little hooks, of the kind known on the market as adhesive ribbon closure, but it is obvious that any openable closing device, for instance of the button, hook or zipper type can be utilised just as well.So it is also obvious that other openable closing devices can be provided at other parts of the pyjamas, whereas some of the devices shown in the drawings can be omitted. For instance, one of such further devices can be located at the centre of the front area 20 of the jacket, so as to provide, when opened, a complete central front opening between the neckline and the waist, while another openable closing device can be located at the central area of the back, so as to provide, when opened, a complete central back opening between the neck and the waist.Also, with a proper openable closing device a complete opening can be created at the innermost bottom part of the sleeves and the sides of the jacket till the waist, so as to be able to carry out the jacket in two separate halves. Similarly, as far as the trousers 14 are concerned, a further openable closing device can be provided at the crutch, so as to carry out a closeable opening which extends from about 10 cm under the waist line in the front part to about 10 cm under the waist line in the back part.Furthermore, by locating another openable closing device at the innermost part of the legs of the trousers, also these latter ones can be carried out in two separate halves.It is obvious that other numerous changes and modifications can be performed by the skilled in the art on the embodiment of the present invention hereinbefore described, without departing from the scope of it it is intended therefore that all these changes and modifications are encompassed in the field of this invention.
