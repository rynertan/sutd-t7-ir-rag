# Process for producing olefin polymers.

## Abstract
Olefin polymers or copolymers have been prepared using a polymerization catalyst composed of A a solid titanium catalyst component containing magnesium, titanium, halogen and an electron donor and derived from a magnesium containing solid carrier obtain ed by contacting a magnesium compound in the liquid sta te with a precipitant, and B an organometallic compound of a metal of Groups I to III of the periodic table. According to the invention polymers of high stereo specificity are produced in the form of free flowing parti cles or granules using a highly active catalyst in which the catalyst component A is a reaction product of a titanium compound in the liquid state and a magnesium containing solid carrier, I the magnesium containing solid carrier being form ed by contacting i a magnesium compound in the liquid state having no reducing ability and not containing a tetraalkoxy , tetra cycloalkoxy or tetraaryloxy titanium compound, said ma gnesium compound being selected from a liquid magne sium compound a hydrocarbon solvent solution of a ma gnesium compound and a magnesium compound in the liquid state obtained by contacting a magnesium com pound with an electron donor selected from alcohols, or ganic carboxylic acids, aldehydes, amines and mixtures thereof, with ii a precipitant other than a titanium compound, and ii the reaction product being formed by reacting a titanium compound iv in the liquid state with the magne sium containing solid carrier from I an electron donor iii having no active hydrogen being used at least once in I and or II .
