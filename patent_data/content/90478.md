## Description
Title Method and apparatus for stimulating carcasses by means of electrical pulses. The invention relates to a method and apparatus for stimulating carcasses by means of electrical pulses. It is generally nown that the quality of the meat of a carcass,especially on the score of tenderness and color, can be enhanced by passing electrical pulses through the carcass.This technique is commonly referred to as electrical stimulatIon. Moreover, the use of electrical stimulation appears to substantially reduce the period of tie required for the pH vale cf the meat to drop to a level suitable for chilling the meat. More particularly, electrical stimulation results in the following advantages the breakdown of muscle carbchydrates and high energy phosphates of the meat is accelerated, resulting in the pn value dropping rapidly to the desired level. As a result thereof, so called cold shortaning is prevented. B cold shortening is understood an excessive contraction of a muscle occuring when chilling meat having a too high pH value, generally speaking a pE value in excess of 6.0, and resulting in tis meat becoming leathery.It further appears that electrical stimulation results in an additional tenderizing effect irrespective of the degree of muscle contraction. Furthermore, the color of the meat is considerably enhanced, presumably by a denaturation of muscle proteins. In a known method and apparatus for electrical stimulation of carcasses, for reasons of safety use is made of a series of low voltage pulses having an effective value of approximately 5 volts or less. In order to achieve that the current passing through the carcass is sufficient for effecting adequate electrical stimulation, a positive, i.e.live, electrode of a unit producing electrical voltage pulses need be manually attached to the carcass by means of a special clamp to be placed at a particular nerve center located in the nose of the carcass,while the chain from which the carcas is suspended is earthed. As this known method requires manual attachment of the live electrode to each carcas at the afore said particular location, problems of a techncal and economical nature arise if relatively large numbers of carcasses are to be processed within a limited period of tine. For example, if a number of 1600 to 1800 carcasses has to be processed per day, it is not feasible to each time stop the conveyor line for attaching the nose clamp electrode In other words, such a known method is not suitable for use in an automated process. On the other hand, electrical stimulation techniques are known in which use is made of relatively high voltages, for example approxir.ately 3000 to OCO volts.For reasons of safety ar.d or reasons of an operational and economical nature, however, these known high voltage techniques are less suitable for use in an automated process too. It is an object of the invention to provide a method and apparatus for electrical stimulation lacking the above drawbacks inherent in prior art techniques. In accordance with the invention, a method for the electrical stimulation of carcasses is characterized by applying one or a number of successive high voltage pulses across two spaced surface regions of the skin of the carcass undergoing treatment so as to reduce the electrical contact resistance of the skin or horny layer at these surface regions, and subsequent thereto applying electrical low voltage pulses to these surface regions of reduced contact resistance. Furthermore, a method for the electrical stimulation of carcasses is characterized in that the electrical stimulation of the carcasses is performed subsequent to the bleeding phase and prior to the skinning phase of a carcas processing line. In this manner, the nerve paths of the carcass will still be conductive, so that a particularly effective stimulation is achieved. Furthermore, as the stimulation is performed prior to the skinning of the carcass, the transfer of infections is practically excluded. In a method according to the invention, the high voltage pulse s is are used only for locally affecting the skin or horny layer of a carcass so that tht local electrical contact resistance is substantially reduced.The electrical low voltage pulses, which are primarily active in realizing the desired electrical stimulation, may be applied to the carcass in an efficient manner suitable for automation without the continuous progress cf the processing procedure being interrupted. In particular, a method according to the invention is characterized in that the high voltage pulses are applied periodically at a rate a number of times lower than that at which the low voltage pulses are applied. In a preferred embodiment of the method according to the invention, the high voltage pulses are periodically applied at a rate of maximally 60 pulses per minute, each high voltage pulse being present during a time interval of maximally 1.5 milliseconds. In this embodiment, preferably the low voltage is applied in the form of periodic pulses having a repetition rate of approximately 14 Hz and a peak value ensuring the desired passage of current through the carcass. The invention renders it possible to reduce the pH value of a carcass in such rapid manner that a carcass can be chilled and stored in a refrigerating space directly after having traversed the dressing line. An apparatus for performing a method of electrical stimulation, which apparatus is suitable for use In an automated processing line, comprises a carcass conveyor means including a flexible carcass carrIer attached thereto, a first electrode rail cf electrically conductive material which is electrically insulated relative to a stationary support, such as a wall, and is adapted to support and guide a carcass advanced by the carcass conveyor means, and a second electrode rail extending substantially parallel to the first electrode rail. In accordance with the invention, such an apparatus is characterized in that the second electrode rail is a electrically insulated relative to a stationary support therefor, b electrically connected to the positive live output terminal of a unit generating electrical voltage pulses, and c mounted beyond the reach of operating personnel the first electrode rail is a electrically connected to the negative neutral output terminal of the unit generating electrical voltage pulses, and b provided with at least one protruding edge arranged for supporting an advancing carcass sliding along this rail by a relatively small surface region of the skin and the flexible carcass carrier includes a section of electrically conductive material which is electrically insulated relative to the carcass conveyor means and is adapted to slide along the second electrode rail while in electrical contact therewith. The structural realization of such an apparatus according to the invention is robust, simple, inexpensive and reliable in operation. The two electrode rails are so mounted relative to the carcass conveyor means and the suspension chain attached thereto that, by gravity, a carcass suspended from this chain preferably by a hind leg a has a shoulder portion urged against the lowermost electrode rail, which is at zero potential, and b urges the suspension chain against the uppermost electrode rail, which is at operating potential, so that the carcass being advanced by the carcass conveyor means is electrically connected through sliding contact connections to the unit for generating the required electrical voltage pulses while being electrically insulated relative to the surroundings. Furthermore, as the uppermost, live rail is mounted beyond the reach of operating personnel and the currentconducting circuit including the carcass undergoing treatmentIs electrically insulated relative to the surroundings, the apparatus is safe for operating personnel. Moreover, the apparatus can be manufactured at a reasonable costprice, while the structural realization is such that the slaughtering capacity is not reduced by the stimulating procedure. In particular, an apparatus for performing a method of electrical stimulation according to the invention is characterized in that the first electrode rail is configured so that the contact surface between this rail and the carcass is so small that a sufficient contact pressure is ensured while no damage is being done to the skin. It is a technical advantage of the present invention that the electrical stimulation can be performed following the bleeding phase of a carcass without impairing operational safety. This means that in an apparatus according to the invention the first electrode rail is mounted at a level approximately corresponding to the position of the shoulder of a carcass suspended from the conveyor means In accordance with a further aspect of the invention, the second electrode rail is configured so that a proper electrical contact with the Insulated, electrically conductive section of the flexible carcass carrier is ensured. For reasons of manufacture, in accordance with the invention it is further advantageous to compose the second electrode rail of a plurality of sections which are insulated relative to each other and the stationary supporting surface and which are each connected through a separate line to the positive live output terminal of a unit generating the required electrical voltage pulses A unit for generating the required electrical voltage pulses which can advantageously be used in an apparatus for performing a method of electrical stimulation in accordance with the invention, is characterized by a high voltage generator for producing periodic high voltage pulses, which generator includes an output circuit having a unidirectional section through which an electrical current produced by the respective high voltage pulse is passed to an output terminal and a low voltage generator for producing periodic low voltage pulses, which generator includes an output circuit having a unidirectional section through which an electrical current produced by the low voltage pulses is passed to the afore said output terminal. In particular, in accordance with the invention such a unit generating electrical voltage pulses is characterized in that the high voltage generator is adapted to produce voltage pulses having a peak value of maximally 10 kvolts, a pulse width of maximally 1.5 milliseconds and a rate of maximally 6C pulses per minute and the low voltage generator is adapted to produce voltage pulses having a peak value ensuring the desired passage of current through the carcass and a rate of 14 Hz. In illustratIon of the invention, a number of embodiments will be described hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 schematically shows a side elevational view of an apparatus for performing the method of electrical stimulation according to the invention Fig. 2 schematically shows a front elevational view of the apparatus shown in Fig. 1 Fig. 3 shows a block diagram of a unit capable of producing the electrical voltage pulses required for performing the method of electrical stimulation according to the invention and Figs. 4.1 4.8 show different voltage waveforms in illustration of the operation of the unit shown in Fig. 3. The embodiments of apparatuses for performing a method of electrical stimulation according to the invention as shown in the Figures are intended to serve only in illustration of the invention without the exclusive rights claimed being restricted thereto. The method of electrical stimulation according to the invention is based on the concept that the high voltage, when applied to a carcass in the form of a pulse of short duration, is operative to reduce the relatively high contact resistance presented by the skin or horny layer of the carcass so that the electrical currents required for the electrical stimulation of the carcass can be produced by means of known per se low voltage pulses applied to the carcass through surface regions the contact resistance of which has thus been reduced. Strictly speaking, a single high voltage pulse having a peak value of maximally 10 kvolts and a width of maximally 1.5 milliseconds is sufficient for preparing a carcass for subsequent low voltage pulses causing the desired electrical stimulation. For reasons of a practical and technical nature, however, it is recorrmended to periodIcally apply such high voltage pulses to the carcass undergoing treatment, for example at a rate of one pulse per second, and to apply the low voltage pulses causing the electrical stimulation at a higher rate, for example 14 pulses per second, in the time intervals between successive high voltage pulses, the low voltage pulses having a peak value of 80 volts. An embodiment of an apparatus for performing a method of electrical stimulation according to the invention is schematically shown in Figs. 1 and 2, while Fig. 3 shows a block diagram of a unit capable of generating the electrical voltage pulses required for the electrical stimulation according to the invention. In Figs. 1 and 2, reference numeral 1 identifies a conveyor means movable along a conveyor rail of a dressing line. A chain, the so called leg chain, from which the carcass 2 undergoing treatment is suspended by one of the hind legs, is attached to the conveyor means 1. A portion of this leg chain consists of electrically insulating material, which is schematically indicated by reference numeral 3 in Figs. 1 and 2.For this purpose, use may be made of a piece of electrically insulating material, such as polyester hoisting belt, having a length of e.g. 10 centimeters and attached between a pair of known per se triangle shackles. In this manner, the chain section from which the carcass is suspended is electrically insulated relative to the conveyor means and the surroundings. The apparatus further includes a first electrode rail 4 arranged to support and guide the carcass suspended from the conveyor means when the carcass is being advanced by this conveyor means. This first electrode rail is secured by means of a connection member 5 of electrically insulating material to a support bracket. This support bracket is mounted to a stationary support, such as a wall 7. The first electrode rail is mounted at suc a dIstance from the flocr 8 that a carcass suspended from the leg chain has its one shoulder portion urged against this electrode rail and remains in this position while being advanced.Furthermore, this first electrode rail is placed at such a horizontal distance from the wall 7 that the neck of the suspended carcass is located over the socalled blood gutter 9. For example, this first electrode rail may be a metal bar of substantially U shaped crosssection so that the carcass contacts this first electrode rail b way of two relatively small skin surface regions. The apparatus further includes a second electrode rail 10 mounted substantially parallel to the first electrode rail 4 at such a distance from the floor 8 that this second electrode rail is beyond the reach of operating personnel. Similarly, this second electrode rail is secured by means of a connection member 11 of electrically insulating material to a support bracket 12 mounted to a stationary support such as the wall 7.The first and the second electrode rail and the carcass conveyor means are so mounted relative to each other that, by gravity, a carcass suspended from the leg chain has a shoulder portion urged against the first electrode rail 4 and causes the section of the chain that is electrically insulated relative to the surroundings to be urged against the second electrode rail 10. When advanced by the conveyor means, the carcass is thus in electrical sliding contact with the first electrode rail 4 and the second electrode rail 10.The first electrode 4 and the second electrode rail 10 are electrically connected through a first line 13 and a second line 14, respectively, to the negative neutral and the positive live output terminal, respectivly, of the unit not shown in Figs. 1 and 2 for producing the electrical voltage pulses required for the electrical stimulation according to the invention. As schematically shown in Pig. 2, it is possible to compose the second electrode rail of a plurality three in the embodiment shown of sections 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3 which are electrically insulated relative to each other. These sections are secured to each other by means of connection members 15 and 16 of electrically insulating material. Each of these sections is electrically connected through an individual lIne to the positive live output terminal of a unit for generating the electrical voltage pulses required for the electrical stimulation. If desired, in this embodiment three individual ones of such units may be used having their negative neutral output terminals connected in common to the first electrode rail 4. Fig. 3 shows a block diagram of a unit for generating the voltage pulses required for the electrical stimulation according to the invention. The unit is energized via a supply terminal from a conventional mains, such as a 220 volts, 50 HzAC mains. Such a unit includes a high voltage generator section 17 and a low voltage generator section 18. The high voltage generator section s adapted to produce in the loaded state periodic high voltage pulses, particularly high voltage pulses having a peak value of 3 molts in this embodiment, a rate of one pulse per second and a pulse width of approximately 1 millisecond. The high voltage generator section 17 includes an input stage 19 in which the AC voltage supplied by the mains is rectified and doubled so that a fluctuating DC voltage having a peak value of approximately 500 volts is obtained at the output of this input stage see Fig. 4.1 . The DC voltage thus formed at the output of the input stage is applied to an energy storage stage 20 including a bank of capacitors. The arrangement is so that this bank of capacitors is charged by means of the output voltage of the input stage during a predetermined period of time, for example 1 second, after which an electronic switching means, such as a thyristor circuit, initiates a switching operation causing the electrical charge accumulated in the bank of capacitors to be discharged to a high voltage transformer 21.The voltage obtained at the output of this energy storage stage 20 has a configuration as shown in Fig. 4.2. High voltage pulses having the configuration shown in Fig. 4.3 are induced from the output voltage of the energy storage stage 20 by means of the high voltage transformer 21. An output circuit 22 including a set of blocking diodes dimensioned for high voltages is operative to rectify and transfer these high voltage pulses to the output terminal 14, which is the positive or live output terminal of the unit. The voltage pulses presented at this output terminal havethe configuration shown in Fig. 4.4. As will be explained lateron, the high voltage transtorm2r 21 also functions as an isolating transformer, so that the output terminal 14 is electrically floating relative to the surroundings. The low voltage generator section 18 includes an input transformer 24 for transforming the AC mains voltage down to an AC voltage of approximately 70 volts R.M.S. The output voltage of this input transformer is schematically shown in Fig. 4.5 and is applied to a rectifier stage 25 operative to produce a DC voltage of approximately 80 volts at its output see Fig. 4.6 . This DC voltage is applied to a known per se electronic switching circuit 26, in which it is converted to a square shaped output voltage of the configuration shown in Fig. 4.7. This square shaped output voltage is applied to the output terminal 14 through an output stage 27 including a set of blocking diodes. Consequently, a composite output voltage comprising the high voltage pulses of the configuration shown in Fig. 4.4 and the output pulses of the configuration shown in Fig. 4.8 appears at the output terminal 14.The input transformer 24 is likewise arranged as an isolating transformer, so that the output terminal 14 is fully floating relative to the surroundings. To this end, the two isolating transformers 21 and 24 are dimensioned to satisfy the standard NEN 40015. The blocking diodes included in the output stage 27 prevent the high voltage pulses produced by the high voltage generator section from having an undesired effect on the low voltage generator section. Xn a thus arranged apparatus it is achieved that both the live and the neutral output terminal, as well as the carcass electrically connected thereto are electrically fully floating relative to the surroundings, which means that the electrical circuit formed via these output terminals and the carcass fs electrically uncoupled relative to the surroundings and ground. This is essential in connection with the operational safety of the apparatus. The current flowing through the carcass as a result of the low voltage pulses is on the order of approximately 200 milliamps. The amount of energy generated by the high voltage pulses is within accepted safety standards. Self evidently, the embodiments described above may be modified by the worker in the art and or different embodiments may be realized without the scope of the present invention being transgressed.
