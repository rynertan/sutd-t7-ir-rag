# Method for recovering methane from coal seams.

## Abstract
Methane is recovered from an underground coal seam via a borehole which extends from the earth s surface through the overburden to a cavity that is created by hydraulic, mechanical or chemical techniques at the bottom of the hole and to which the coal is caved under the influence of the in situ rock stresses. Adsorbed methane is freed by the natural crush ing.
