# Mold for use in metal or metal alloy casting systems and process for mixing a molten metal or metal alloy.

## Abstract
A mold 12 for use in an apparatus 10 and process utilizing an electromagnetic field to stir a molten metal or metal alloy comprises a plurality of laminations 62, 72, 77 of thermally and electrically conductive material separated by electrically insulating material. The electrically insulat ing material is oriented to minimize at least some of the flow path lengths of currents induced in the mold 21 whereby magnetic induction losses caused by the mold 12 are substantially reduced and the stirring efficiency is en hanced.
