## Description
This invention relates to a soft contact lens. The soft contact lens of the invention is prepared from a m√ènomer mixture preferably containing trifluoro ethyl methacrylate and or hexafluoroisopropyl methacrylate and, when used, is difficult to be deposited with tears or the like. The invention makes it possible to provide a soft contact lens having excellent mechanical strength and elasticity, which can sufficiently stably retain its lens shape even when processed into a thin lens. In recent years, soft contact lenses hereinafter abbreviated as soft lenses t have come to be widely used in place of conventional hard contact lenses because of their comfort of wearing. Most soft lenses are composed mainly of 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate HtYS or N vinylpyrrolidone NVP , and have a water content of as a wide range as from about 20 to 85 .Soft lenses vary in physical properties such as mechanical strength, refractive index, oxygen permeability, specific gravity and the like depending on the water content of the materials. In general wit increase in the waver content, the oxygen per eability increases, but the mechanical strength decreases. Further the refractive index and the specific ravity decrease and approach the value of water. Since the materials for soft lenses are high in affinity for tears, the surfaces of the lenses are well wetted. Consequently, while soft lenses are used, resistance to soft lenses on the Qtithelium of a cornea and on the inner surface of an eyelid is reduced, so wearers of soft lenses are relieved of discomfort due to the lenses as foreign bodies. Further, soft lenses permit, to a certain extent, the supply of oxygen to a cornea epithelium through their own materials, and hence have a function of relieving wart of oxygen in a cornea to some degree. Increase in the water content of soft lenses leads to improvement of the wettabtiity and oxygen pe eabi lity through the lenses, but results in lowering of the mechanical strength of the materials, so that the lenses get easier to break while handled. As another method for supplying more oxygen to a cornea, there is a method by which soft lenses are made more thinner. This method is advantageous in that wearers of soft lenses are relieved of uncomfortableness due to the lenses as foreign bodies. However, according to this method, the front side and the back side of the lenses are difficult to distinauish from each other when the lenses are handled, and the lenses are folded in two and the two halves adhere to each other when the lenses are handled, so that the lenses are very inconvenient when attached to eyes. As a general problem in soft lenses, there is a problem of contamination on the lenses. Contamination on soft lenses is due to the adhesion of proteins, lipids, mucoids and the like in tears the denaturation, precipitation and adhesion thereof by boiling and the adhesion of proteins, lipids and the like from fingers during handling of the lenses. The lenses stained there with show white turbidity, color change to yellow and the like. Further, when the precipitated and adhered matters form a layer, the layer of these matters is cracked, so that the surface of the lenses becomes uneven.Consequently, the surface of the lenses becomes waterrepellent and is lowered in oxygen permeability, so that the comfortableness to wearing deteriorates Further, the formation of said layer facilitates propagation of fungi, bacteria and the like. When soft lenses are seriously deposited, the effect of improving visual acuity by the lenses is greatly lessened and the discomfort due to the lenses as foreign bodies becomes very serious. The lenses sometimes become unusable. Further, the lenses sometimes cause cornea disease of their wearers and hence contamination is a serious problem in soft lenses. As one mode of the employment of a soft lens, there is sometimes made an attempt to provide for continuous wear a soft ins having a high water content for a patient after a cataract operation.However, in this case, since a material having a high water content is used, a tear composition is apt tot penetrate into the material, and the lens is liable to be contaminated because it cannot be washed everyday, which causes shortening of life of the lens. When contamination of soft lenses is caused by a tear composition, the contamination of the lenses varies depending upon the difference in composition of tears among wearers, but, in general, there is strong suspicion of the origin against proteins, particularly lysozyme present in tears. Further, mucoids, lipids and the like appear to adhere to the lysozymes complexly. As a treatment for contamination on soft lenses, there are now used a washing treatment with a cleaner and a treatment with an enzymatic agent, however1 in a sense, these are only passive countermeasl es for removing deposits. Further, these treatments sometimes cause deposits on the lenses when the subsequent washing is insufficient. In consideration of these facts, the present inventors have devoted themselves to studies to succeed in imparting deposit resistance to a material itself for a soft lens without deteriorating its physical properties, and to finding a soft lens that retains its lens shape sufficiently even when its thickness is small, and is convenient for handling, whereby this invention has been aecomplished. That is to say, an object of this invention is to provide a soft lens to which proteins, lipids, mucoids and the like from tears and the like h ardly adhere. Another object of this invention is to provide a soft lens which retains its lens shape sufficiently even when its thickness is small. The present invention provides a soft contact lens comprising a copolymer obtained by polymerizing a composition comprising A at least 50 by weight at least one monomethacrylate of an alkylene glycol, B 5 to 35 by weight of at least one fluorine containing methacrylic ester wherein the ester moiety contains up to 4 carbon atoms and C less than 40 by weight of one or more compounds selected from the group consisting of an unsaturated carboxylic acid having one or more carboxyl groups in the molecule, a monomethacrylate of a polyhydric alcohol having three or more hydroxyl groups, and an alkyl methacrylate the percentages of A I B and C being calculated on the basis of the total weight of A B C and the sum of the percentages of A B C being 100 . The fluorine containing methacrylic ester is advantageously a fluorine containing alkyl ester wherein the alkyl group contains at least one terminal CF3 groupTrifluoroethyl methacrylate hereinafter abbreviated as TFEM wherein the trifluoroethyl group has the formula CH2CF3, and or hexafluoroisopropyl methacrylate hereinafter abbreviated as HFIPM , wherein the hexafluoroisopropyl group has the formula CH CF3 2, are preferably used as the fluorine containing methacrylic ester and the invention is thus primarily discussed in terms of these compounds.Other fluorine containing methacrylic esters which may be used include pentafluoro n propyl methacrylate wherein the pentafluoro propyl group has the formula CH2CF2CF31 and pentafluoro n butyl methacrylate wherein the pentafluoro n butyl group has the formula CH2CH2CF2CF3. The composition used in accordance with the invention contains at least 50 by weight of component A based on the total weight of A B C . The amount of component A should not exceed 95 by weight. Component C must be present that is the proportion of component C cannot be zero. The soft contact lens of the invention is preferably obtained by subjecting to casting polymerization by a continuous and or stepwise temperature raising method a composition as specified above mechanically processing and polishing the resulting polymer to give thereto a lens shape and then hydrating and swelling the polymer. A continuous and or stepwise temperature raising method of from 350C to 1100C is preferably used. Advantageously the soft lens of this invention is obtained by subjecting to casting polymerization by a continuous or stepwise temperature raising method from 35 C to 110 C, a composition comprising 50 to 95 by weight of a monomethacrylate of an alkylene glycol 5 to 35 by weight of trifluoroethyl methacrylate hereinafter abbreviated as TFEM and or hexafluoroisopropyl methacrylate hereinafter abbreviated as HFIPM and less than 40S by weight of one or more compounds selected from the group consisting of an unsaturated carboxylic acid having one or more carboxyl groups in the molecule, a monomethacrylate of a polyhydric alcohol having three or more hydroxyl groups, and an alkyl methacrylate finishing the resulting polymer by mechanical processing and polishing to give thereto a lens shape and then subjecting it to a hydration and swelling treatment involving an alkali treatment. Since at least one fluorine containing monomer such as TFEM or HFIPM is used in the soft lens of this invention, foreign matters adhere hardly to the surface of the soft lens, so that the soft lens is greatly reduced in color change to yellow and in white turbidity as compared with conventional soft lenses. Further, the lens can sufficiently retain its normal lens shape even when processed so as to be thin which is also a new property obtained by the addition of at least one fluorinecontaining monomer such as TFEM and HFIPM. The production of a soft lens by use of a fluorine containing acrylic or methacrylic ester has conventionally been known Louis Plamseck Jr. JapanesePatent Appln. Kokai Laid Open 29,660 1978, U.S. Patent 4130706 however this process uses a fluorinecontaining ester whose ester motets is a straight chain having 5 or more carbon atoms and uses no fluorine containing ester whose ester moiety is short for example wii less than 5 carbon atoms such as TFEM and HFIPM used in this invention.It has been confirmed that a hydroxyl grouo containing monomer and the fluorine containing monomer used in the abovementioned patent are poor in miscibility with each other and give only an opaque polymer by usual bulk polymerization, however TFEM and HFIPM used in this invention can give a transparent polymer and lens without causing white turbidity and opaqueness, by bulk polymerization with the hydroxyl group containing monomer, which is a novel finding by present inventors. Further, unlike this invention, the above mentioned patent does not aim at obtaining a deposit resistant soft lens.When at least one fluorine containing monomer suc as TFEM, HFIPM or the like is used as a copolymer component in this invention, a soft lens good in shape stability, elasticity and mechanical strength can be obtained even when the thickness of the lens is small. Therefore, there could be obtained an ideal soft lens which advantageously supplies oxygen to the cornea of a lenswearer and gives only slight discomfort due to the lens as a foreign body. It has become clear that as compared with conventional soft lenses containing no fluorine, the soft lens of this invention is reduced in deposit with proteins, lipids and mucoids. In particular, deposit with protein was measured by use of lysozyme labeled with 1251 to show a significant difference in absorption of the lysozyme between the soft lens containing at least one fluorine containing monomer of this invention and a soft lens containing no fluorine and having the same water content as that of the soft lens of this invention. Further, even when the thickness of the lens of this invention was adjusted so as to be one third of the conventional thickness about 0.05 mm in central thickness , the lens retained its shape, and such a phenomenon that a piece of lens gets folded into two and stuck was not observed, and the lens could be handled without inconvenience. This was an unexpected result, and was the discovery of a novel effect brought about by the employment of at least one fluorine containing monomer. The fluorine containing monomer is used in an amount of 5 to 35 by weight. TFEM and HFIPM can bemused alone or simultaneously. However, when the added amount of the fluorine containing monomer is less than 5 My weight, the effect of the monomer on antideposit is insufficient, and with increase of the added amount, the effect on antideposit is heightened, but the elasticity of the resulting soft lens is reduced. When the added amount exceeds 35 by weight, elasticity required of a soft lens becomes unobtainable. Preferably, an amount of 10 to 20 by weight is employed. The monomethacrylate of an alkylene glycol is monomethacrylate of, for example, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol or a polyethylene glycol, and is the main constituent of the soft lens of this invention. As the monomethacrylate, ethylene glycol monomethacrylate, i.e., 2hydroxyethyl methacrylate 2 HEMA is preferably used. Simultaneous.use of 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate and propylene glycol monomethcarylate is also preferred. Representative examples of the unsaturated carboxylic acids having one or more carboxyl groups in one molecule include acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, itaconic acid and the like, and the unsaturated carboxylic acid is a constituent for increasing the water content by a hydration and swelling treatment involving an alkali treatment and imparting elasticity required for a soft lens. As the unsaturated carboxylic acid, methacrylic acid is particularly preferred. As the monomethacrylate of a polyhydric alcohol having three or more hydroxyl groups, glyceryl methacry ate or monomethacrylate of pentaerythritol is pbNbly used, and this constituent contributes to the increase of the water content and the elasticity. The preferred alkyl methacrylate is the methyl, ethyl, n propyl or n butyl ester of methacrylic acid, and is a constituent for improving the strength, processability and shape stability of the resulting soft lens. In addition to these constituents, there may be used, as cross linking agents, polyfunctional miners suchfor example ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, diethylene glycol dimethacrylate, triethylene glycol dimethacrylate, tetraethylene glycol dimethacrylate, butylene glycol dimethacrylate, neopentyl glycol dimethacrylate, propylene glycol dimethacrylate, diethvlene glycol bisallylcarbonate, trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate, bisphenolA dimethacrylate, methylenebisacrylamide, and the like.N vinylpyrrolidone, acrylamide, methacrylamide or the like may be used as a constituent for increasing the water content. As the polymerization initiator, there may be used any suitable,for example conventional radical generating agents , fcr benzoyl peroxide, lauroyl peroxide, cumene hydroperoxide, di tert butyl peroxide, bis 4 tert butylcyclohexyl peroxydicarbonate, diisopropyl peroxydicarbonate azobisisobutyronitrile, azobisisovaleronitrile and the like, and initiators generating a radical at low temperatures are more preferable. In a preferred method for making the lenses of this inven tion, the desir constituents are mixed and then poured into aold made of a metal, glass or plastics, after which in such a condition that the resulting mixture is hermetically sealed, polymerization is completed in an electric furnace by a continuous temperature raising method of from 350 to 1100C. After completion of the polymerization, the resulting polymer is taken out of the mold and finished by usual mechanical processing and finishing to give thereto a lens shape.In order to hydrate and swell the finished adens, the lens is immersed in a physiological saline containing sodium carbonate, sodium hydrogencarbonate, potassium hydrogencarbonate, and or the like, at room temperature or with heating, and then immersed in a physiological salt solution and allowed to stand at room temperature or heated while the physiological salt solution is renewed several times, to be hydrated and swollen. The thus produced soft lens has the same optical properties and elasticity as those of conventional soft lenses, and has such an effect of the addition of at least one fluorine containing monomer that it is less susceptible to adhesion of deposit due to proteins, lipids and mucoids than conventional soft lenses.Further, a soft lens retaining a lens shape sufficiently stably could be obtained even when the thickness of the soft lens was small. This invention is further explainedJielow in more detail referring to Examples and Comparative Examples, which are not by way of limitation but by way of illustration. In Examples and Comparative Examples, parts are by weight. Example 1 To a mixture of 89.7 parts of 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate, 10 parts of TFEM and 0.3 part of methacrylic acid was added 0.1 part of azobisisobutyrohitrile as a polymerization initiator, and the resulting mixture was sufficiently stirred and mixed, poured into a mold made of plastics, and then hermatically sealed up therein. The mixture was then subjected to polymerization in a continuous temperature raising furnace of from 350 to 1100C, and the resulting transparent polymer was processed by cutting and polishing to give thereto a lens shape.The thus obtained lens was treated in a physiological saline containing 1.28 of sodium hydrogencarbonate at 800 to 900C for 1 hour and then in a physiological salt solution at 800 to 900C for 1 hour, whereby the lens was allowed to absorb water and swell and at the same time, the unpolymerized monomer was eluted from the lens. The thus obtained soft lens had a water content of 35 and a tensile strength of about 850 g mm2, was comfortable to wear and, as shown in Table 1, adsorbed only very small amount of protein lysozyme as compared with a conventional soft lens having the same water content, though it was equal in optical properties to the conventional soft lens. Further, the soft lens, even when its thickness was made smaller, had the same shape stability as did those having a conventional thickness. Example 2 To a mixture of 84 parts of 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate, 15 parts of TFEM and 1 part of methacrylic acid was added O.1 part of diisopropyl peroxydicarionate, and the same procedure as described in Example 1 was followed to obtain a soft lens having a water content of 36 . As shown in Table 1, this lens adsorbed only very small amount of the protein as compared with the conventional soft lens having the same water content and containing no fluorine compound.Example 3 To a mixture of 70 parts of 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate, 10 parts of TFEM and 20 parts of glyceryl methcarylate was added 0.1 part of bis 4 tert butylcyclohexyl peroxydicarbonate, and polymerization and lens processing were carried out in the same manner as inExample 1, after which the thus obtained lens was treated in a physiological salt solution at 800 to 900C for 2 hours to produce a soft lens having a water content of 36 . This soft lens had excellent resistance to deposit.Examples 4 to 14 Soft lenses having various compositions and water contents were produced by the same technique as inExamples 1 to 3. All the soft lenses were colorless and transparent, had the same optical properties, mechanical processability and strength as conventional soft lenses, and were less susceptible to deposit with proteins. The soft lenses had good shape stability even when they were thin.Comparative Examples 1 to 4 By the same technique as in Examples 1 to 3, soft lenses were produced from individual polymers having various compositions containing no fluorine containing monomer, and were used as controls. Each of the soft lenses obtained in the aboveExamples and Comparative Examples was immersed in a solution of egg white lysozyme labeled with radioactive iodine 125I concentration 500 vg ml, pH 7.3 0.05 M borate buffer , and taken out of the solution after 2.5 hours, 24 hours, 3 days and 10 days, and the lens surface was washed with flowing water. Thereafter, the amount of egg white lysozyme adhered to the lens was measured by a method by which y rays were detected by means of a welltype scintillation counter. As shown in Tables 1 to 4, the amounts of lysozyme adhered to the lenses of the comparative examples 1 to 4 containing no fluorinecontaining monomer as a copolymer component are taken as 100 , and those in the examples are shown in comparison therewith. The shape stability is expressed by z , o, 8 or x explained below based on the observation of the elasticity, ability to restore the original shape during handling, and shape stability during handling of a thin lens central thickness O.05 mm .
