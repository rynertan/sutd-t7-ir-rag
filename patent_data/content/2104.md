## Description
The present invention is concerned with pleochroic dyes suitable for uee in solution with liquid crystal materials for electro optic device applications. Electro optic display devices of certain known types depend upon liquid crystal properties displayed by certain compounds known as liquid crystal compounds or materials which display phases intermediate between the fully ordered crystalline state and the fully disordered liquid state, apart from certain temporary short range ordering that is present in most liquid phases. Broadly speaking there are two principal types of liquid crystal phase, the smectic mesophase in which the molecular ordering is of a substantially lamellar type and the nematic mesophase in which the ordering is substantially linear. Included sometimes as a sub claim of the nematic mesophase and sometimes classified as a separate mesophase is the cholesteric mesophase. This last type has a helical order, arising from the presence of a chiral or optically active centre in the molecular composition of the material and this helical order is superimposed upon the linear order of the nematic sosophase. Liquid crystal materials have the property of imposing their own ordering upon other molecules incorporated in the materials and having an appropriate molecular configuration or shape. This property is the basis of guest host devices in which a host liquid crystal material has its orientation controlled by the application of electrical or magnetic fields and in turn imposes its order upon guests molecules of, for exsmple,pleochroic dyes.These are dyes whose absorption properties vary with the orientation direction of the electric vector of light incident upon them relative to their own molecular alignment. A suitable pleochroic dye has an elongated rod,like molecule which absorbs relatively little light passing along its longitudinal axis but has a maximum absorption of light having its electric vector oriented along the longitudinal axis of the molecule. Such dye molecules when placed in a liquid crystal material can adopt an orientation which follows the molecular orientation given to the crystal material and taking advantage of this two broad classes of guest host devices are possible based respectively upon a nematic or Freedericksz effect device and secondly upon a cholesteric to nematic phase change device. In a nematic device the liquid crystal material is originally oriented by known treatment of the inner surfaces of the container, eg glass plates bearing device electrodes, containing the liquid crystal material. This orientation is changed by application of an electric field between the device electrodes. The guest dye material also changes its orientation resulting in a change in absorption of light passing along the axis of the electrical field giving a switchable electro optic display. In a cholesterio to nematic phase change device the liquid crystal material has positive dielectric anisotropy and is or includes an optically active compound which causes the material to exhibit a cholesteric mesophase having a long pitch helical ordering of short range the focal conic state . In the off state the device scatters incident light because the ordering is only short range. However when the device is switched on the electrical field applied across the serial imposes a linear nematic order parallel to the electric field which results in orientation of any guest dye molecules also parallel to the electrical field and provides minimum absorption in that direction.Thus in the on state the device is less scattering and a switchable display is obtained between the on and off states. The dye enhances the contrast between the two states. In order to provide maximum contrast between the two states it is important that the guest molecules adopt as closely as possible the time averaged orientation of the host, however this is achieved only to a limited degree because of random thermal fluctuations. The degree to which the orientation varies from the ideal is measured by a quantity known as the order parameter S which is given by the following equation 1 2 S 2 3 cos2e 1 where cos28 is a time averaged term and e is the instantaneous angular orientation of the molecules with respect to the time averaged orientation of the host molecules.The determination of the value of the order parameter S is well understood in the art see for example the paper A new absorptive mode reflective liquid crystal display device by I L White and o N Taylor in the Journal of Applied Physics, 1974 m pages 4718 to 4723. For perfect orientation the order parameter S is one that is e is zero and pleochroic dyes for use in guest host devices should have an order parameter in the liquid crystal host as near one as possible but they must also have adequate chemical, photochemical and electrochemical stability, eg stability when exposed to atmospheric contaminants, electric fields as in device operation and to ultraeviolet radiation. They should not be ionic or have any ionisable character and must also have sufficient solubility in the host materials although the concentrations of guest pleochroic dye required for the desired effect are generally quite small.The concentration is normally selected to ensure a light absorbance in the range of about 1.0 to 1.2 in the absorbing state of the cell, and of course depends upon cell thickness and the absorption coefficient of the dye.Typically this gives concentrations of pleochroic dye of up to about i by weight of the host material. Although a vast number of dyes are known only a relatively very small proportion of these would be of any practical utility in liquid crystal applications because only a very small proportion are for instance pleochroic, non ionic and sufficiently soluble and capable of aligning in liquid crystal material. Of the small number of dyes which have been found suitable in liquid crystal applications either the properties required for such applications have not been optimised or order parameters have been optimised at the expense of other important properties. For example, the family of dyes containing chains of azo linked phenyl rings described in UK Patent Application No 25859 75 German O.S. No 2627215 US Serial No 695, 404 have members showing high order parameters but in general the stability of the compounds in this family is not particularly good. It is an objet of the invention to provide, for use in solution with liquid crystal material, dyes which show reasonable order parameters as well as reasonable chemical, electrochemical and photochemical stability. In accordance with the present invention a liquid crystal material includes in solution therewith at least one pleochroic dye characterised in that the dye is an anthraquinone of general formula EMI4.1 where R2 i8 either hydrogen or a hydroxyl group, where 5 is an anilino or molifie or substitutedlanilino group and where R1 is hydrogen when R2 is a hydroxyl or ngalified group and R1 is an anilino or substitutedEanilino group when R2 is hydrogen.

Anthraquinone dyes of general formula I have been found to show reasonable order parameters, typically 0.5 or more the precise figure depending in each on experimental conditions, eg the host material and device construction . In addition they have been found to show improved stability, particularly photochemical stability, compared with the dyes containing chains of azo linked phenyl rings referred to above. The liquid crystal material and anthraquinone pleochroic dye are effectively in guest hoet relationship and are thue suitable for use in electro optic device applications. The host liquid crystal material may be any liquid crystal compound or mixture of liquid crystal compounds but it has been found that mixtures of alkyloyanobiphenyls, alkyl oxycyanob iphenyl B and alkylcyanoterphenyls as disclosed and claimed in UK Patent Specifications No 1,433,130 1,44 1,571 and 1,452,826 are particularly advantageous in the present invention. In the Formula fl above the group R4 may represent alkyl groups which are straight chain alkyl groups or branch chain alkyl groups which may include a chiral centre or R4 may represent alkyloxy, alkoxyalkoxy, alkyl or dialkylamino, alkyl or dialkylaminoalkoxy, or dialkyloxycarbonyl groups similarly characterised. The properties and usefulness of a guest material are determined principally by the shape and configuration that it adopts and in particular by the shape and configuration adopted by the group H of Formula II above 4 and so long as the guest achieves a guest host relationship with the host material the identity of the group R4, so long as it falls within the classes delineated, is not critical. Guest pleochroic dyes in which the group R4 is selected from n nonyloxy, p oxy biphenylyl, and p dimsthylamino , are preferred when R2 OH and R1,R5 and H6 H and dyes in which R4 R1 is selected from ethyl, n pentyloxy , and p dimethylamino are preferred when R2 I R5 R6 H. In accordance with a further aspect of the present invention an electrooptic device of the nematic Freedericksz effect or cholesteric to nematic phase change type includes a liquid crystal material including in solution therewith a pleochroic dye of general formula I above. The present invention will now be described by way of example only with reference to the following Sxarnples which describe the synthesis of pleochroic anthraquinone dye falling within the scope of Formula I above and Tables 2 to 5 which also give certain of their properties indicating their suitability as guest materials in the present application and also with reference to the accompanying drawings of which Figure 1 is a cross section of a simple electro optic cell in which a liquid crystal material of the present invention may be employed and Figures 2 to 5 are graphs illustrating the stability of pleochroic dyes employed in the present invention when exposed to ultra violet light. Turning now to Figure 1, an electro optic display cell 10 is shown in cross section and consists of two glass plates 11 and 12 separated by a spacer 13. Each of the glass plates 11 and 12 has on its inner surface a transparent electrode 14 and 15 respectively, connected to a voltage source 16 through a switch 17 connected in series. The space 18 within the electro optic display cell 10 is filled with a guest host liquid crystal material of the present invention The surfaces of the electrodes 14 and 15 may be treated by one of the methods well known to those skilled in the art to control the orientation of immediately adjacent liquid crystal molecules. The voltage source 16 provides a voltage which is normally a low frequency alternating voltage as is well understood in the art. When the switch 17 is open the applied voltage is zero and the liquid crystal molecules take up an appropriate orientation. If the device is to operate as a cholesteric to nematic phase change device the molecules are oriented in helices of cholesteric mesophase corresponding to the focal ionic texture or the planar Grandjean texture. In both of these instances a guest dye molecule takes up the orientation of the host liquid crystal material and the layer 18 appears strongly coloured with the colour of the guest dye molecules because a substantial proportion of the molecules are oriented perpendicular to the direction of the incidence of the light upon the cell. When the switch 17 is closed and the voltage of the source 16 applied across the electrodes 14 and 15 the host liquid crystal material, if of positive dielectric anisotropy, is oriented along the line of the applied field and orients the guest dye molecules in the same direction.The cell then appears clear or weakly coloured because the dye molecules do not significantly absorb light incident in the direction of the electric field, that is along the long axis of the dye molecule. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the electrodes may be shaped in the form of letters or numbers or other symbols sought to be displayed or there may be a multiplicity of electrodes forming individual members of symbols. Also the cell may inclue a reflector eg a white or coloured diffuse reflector, or a mirror behind the cell so as to improve the visibility of the symbol etc. The pleochroic anthraquinone guest materials are readily prepared by methods that will be apparent to one skilled in the art of chemical synthesis and typical synthesis of specific examples are given inExamples 1 to 5 below.

In the following tests a General Electric F20 T12 BLB BlackLight Fluorescent Lamp was used as low level ultra violet light source and solutions of anthraquinone dyes in liquid crystal host E9 were contained in frit sealed nominally10 12 m thick SiO aligned cells, the filling hole being sealed with epoxy resin, and the cells placed upon a heat sink plate 15cm from the lamp. The cells remained at room temperature. a RESISTIVITY The resistivity of the contents of the cell was measured at intervals for a period of up to 1500 hours, the mean of three determinations being taken and plotted to yield the graph displays in Figure 2. Resistivity measurements taken during the first few hours of such tests are not always trustworthy because, it is believed, trace quantities of metal ions are plated on to the electrodes of the cell. Turning now to Figure 2 in which the ordinate is the resistivity of the cell measured in ohm cm on a log scale and the abscissa is time of exposure on a linear scale. The curves, which are the best fit lines drawn through experimental points represent the dyes with which they are labelled. It will be immediately apparent from Figure 2 that the dyes of the present invention are significantly more stale than dye A. b ORDER PARAMETER Using the same type of lamp samples in solution in liquid crystal host E7 were contained in unsealed PVA aligned cells 25 m thick placed 6 away from the lamp. Turning now to Figure 3 in which the ordinate represents the order parameter of the contents of the cell and the abscissa is time of exposure in hours, both on a linear scale, the curves again represent the dyes with which they are labelled. Again it is clear that the dyes of the present invention, in this instance represented by dyes 52, 46, and 27 are considorably more stable than dyes A,B, C of the prior art, and also than 54. This last includes an azo Ñ grouping and turned yellow after 24 hours. Dye C also changed colour during the first hundred hours of the test. At that time it had Nnax 450 nm compared with 568 nm for the original dye see Table 1 . EX1PLE 7 Stability of Materials under high power ultra violet light. In the following tests a Ranovia Are Tube type 509 10 quartz tube with a 500 watt total output in the range 230 to 1000nm and with peaks at 2zCi 254, 2t5, 280, 313, 366, 405, 436 and 577 nm was used as the high power ultra violet light source. a RESISTlvlTr The cells were the same as employed in Example 6 a using E7 as the liquid crystal host material. The cells were placed on a heat sink 20cm fion the lap and had an average temperature I 250C during the test. The resistivity was UIeas11edst. time interval up to a total time of 100 hours. Figure 4, in which the ordinate is resistivity measured in ohm cm and the abscissa is time of exposure both plotted on a log scale and the curves represent the dyes with which they are labelled, gives the results. Again it is clear that the dyes of the present invention are more stable than the prior art dyes represented by dye A. b ORDER PARAMETER Using the same type of lamp as above samples of dye in E7 host material were placed in unsealed PVA aligned cells spaced with MYLAR spacers of 25 or 50 um 20cm from the lamp on a heat sink plate. The cells remained at room temperature. The order parameters were measured at time intervals of up to 100 hours. Turning now to Figure 5, in which the ordinate represents order parameter and the abscissa represents time of exposure both on a linear scale and the graphs represent the dyes with which they are labelled, the order parameter is seen to be substantially unaltered during the course of the experiment. Although the order parameter of dye B remains substantially unaltered the dye itself was degraded and the absorbance of the cell fell from 1.12 to 0.73 progressively throughout the course of the test.This indicates progressive destruction of dye B by the W light.
