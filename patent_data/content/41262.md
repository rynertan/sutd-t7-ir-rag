# Programmable telephone traffic measuring equipment.

## Abstract
The measuring equipment, comprising a stored program processing unit, is connected through a system of probes to the lines on which digital criteria to be extracted are present said probes reduce the voltages present on the lines, accord ing to a fixed and identical ratio, to the values necessary for the operation of the logic circuits of the processing unit. The reduced voltages are compared with suitable threshold vol tages in a comparator that supplies the processing unit with two level signals 0 and 1 . The processing unit interprets the telephone meaning of these signals and executes the requested processings. The processing results are recorded on magnetic cassette tape. Additional devices are connected to the measuring equipment for the analysis of multifre quency criteria and or tones, for the connection to insertion networks of apparatus measuring traffic intensity, or for con tinuous recordings.
