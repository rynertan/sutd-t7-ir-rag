Preferred sub groups for compounds of formula I are as set forth and defined in the aforementioned European Patent Publication, UKPatent Specification and US Patents.The most preferred somatostatin analogue for use in accordance with the present invention is the compound of formula IaEMI5.1 in which Thr ol represents the L threoninol residue of formulaEMI5.2 tb SEP CH3 tb SEP IH OH tb NH CH CH2OH tb SEP L tb hereinafter referred to as SMS, the synthesis of which is specifically described in the aforementioned European PatentPublication.Further preferred somatostatin analogue for use in accordance with the present invention are the compounds of formula Ib and IcEMI5.3 in which Thr ol has the meaning given above, hereinafter referred to as COMPOUND II and COMPOUND III respectively, the synthesis of which is specifically disclosed in the aforementioned UK Patent Specification.The said somatostatin analogues exist, and may be used in accordance with the present invention in free form or in pharmaceutically acceptable salt or complex form. Such salt and complex forms are also known from the aforementioned patent references and include in the case of SMS in particular the acetate. In general such salt and complex forms exhibit the same or similar order of activity and tolerability as the free forms and references throughout the present specification and claims to somatostatin analogues of formula I as well as the compounds SMS,COMPOUND II and COMPOUND III, are to be understood as including both free, and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt and complex forms unless otherwise specified. In accordance with the present invention it has now surprisingly been found that the somatostatin analogues of formula I, in particular SMS, COMPOUND II and COMPOUND III, are effective in inhibiting the proliferation and or keratinisation of epidermal cells and are useful in the treatment of dermatological diseases involving morbid proliferation and or keratinisation of epidermal cells, in particular in the treatment of psoriasis.Effectiveness of the said compounds in the treatment of e.g.psoriasis may be demonstrated in clinical trials, conducted e.g.as follows The trial is conducted employing adult and g subjects exhibi ting chronic severe psoriasis involving 20 or more of the body surface as estimated by the rule of nines, and whose disease condition is either stable or progressive on current therapy. All systemic, topical or phototherapy specifically directed at skin disease is stopped for at least 2 weeks prior to commencement of the trial. Only bland emollients, 2 salicyclic acid in olive oil, coal tar shampoos, and or 1 hydrocortisone cream or ointment and medication for arthritis or other concomitant disease to psoriasis is continued during this period.After the 2 week washout period, subjects are admitted to the trial after an overnight fast of 8 10 hours. On admission, the following laboratory tests are performed complete blood count, serum electrolytes, glucose, calcium, phosphorous, uric acid,ALT AST LDH alanine amino transferase aspartate aminotransferase lactate dehydrogenase , plasma epidermal growth factor, growth hormone, gut peptide profile gastrin, somatostatin, VIP vasoactive intestinal peptide , insulin, glucagon, PP pancreatic polypeptide , neurotensin, substance P, motilin, prolactin, gastrin releasing peptide, GIP gastrin inhibiting peptide and calcitonin and urine EGF. Clinical extent of psoriasis is estimated by rule of nines, and lesions are graded for redness, thickness and scaliness using a 0 4 scale as described byKragballe et al. Arch. dermatol. 119, 548 552 1983 .Clinical photographs are taken of selected lesions. A 6 mm punch skin biopsy is performed using 1 lidocaine infiltration anaesthesia.During the course of the trial subjects receive i 0.1 mg SMS in the form of its acetate day for the first 3 days, administered s.c. in 2 doses of 0.05 mg each, once in the morning and once in the evening ii 0.2 mg SMS in the form of its acetate day for the remaining 25 days, administered s.c. in 2 doses of 0.1 mg each, mornings and evenings .No other therapy is allowed during the trial period, except as already employed during the washout period. All testing carried out at entry into the trial fasting blood, urine, estimation of clinical extent of psoriasis, clinical photography, punch skin biopsy is repeated during the course of the trial on days 7, 14, 21 and 28.Subjects taking part in the trial and receiving SMS in the indicated dose regimen exhibit marked improvement in psoriatic condition as evidenced by progressive reduction in clinical extent of psoriasis, in particular in the extent of psoriatic lesion, as well as by marked reduction in grading for lesion condition. In addition results from sequential punch skin biopsies, indicate marked histological change in relation to lesion condition, including reduction of mitotic index, reduction of inflammatory infiltrate and noticeable improvement in vasculature.Efficacy of SMS therapy may also be proven on repetition of the trial in double blind, cross over format employing two groups of patients, one group receiving SMS in accordance with the above indicated regimen and the other receiving placebo injections only, both groups being matched for extent of lesions.Subjects receiving SMS show marked improvement with respect to parameters specifically listed above as compared with subjects receiving placebo only.Similar results may be obtained employing other compounds of formula I in particular COMPOUND II and COMPOUND III. As an alternative to s.c. administration, the somatostatin analogues may also be applied topically, e.g. at the site of psoriatic lesion, or by other non parenteral route.In accordance with the foregoing, the present invention provides a method for the treatment of dermatological disease involving morbid proliferation or keratinisation of epidermal cells, e.g.for the treatment of psoriasis, in a subject in need of such treatment, which method comprises administering to said subject an effective amount of a somatostatin analogue of formula I as hereinbefore defined, in particular of the compound SMS, COMPOUNDII or COMPOUND III.For this use, the dosage will, of course, vary depending on the mode of administration, the particular somatostatin analogue used and the treatment desired. In general, for SMS, satisfactory results are obtained on administration at a daily dosage in the range of from about 0.01 to about 2.5, preferably about 0.05 to about 0.5, especially about 0.1 to about 0.2 mg day conveniently administered in divided dosages 2 to 4 times a day or in sustained release form. Dosage forms suitable for parenteral e.g. s.c., i.v. or i.m. administration accordingly comprise from about 0.0025 to about 1.25, preferably from about 0.0125 to about 0.25 or 0.5, especially from about 0.025 to about 0.1 mg SMS admixed with an appropriate diluent or carrier therefor.Dosages for other somatostatin analogues of formula I, in particular COMPOUND II and COMPOUND III will be of corresponding order. Where appropriate, initial treatment may subsequently be followed by a second course of therapy with a similar or,where appropriate, reduced dosage regimen.The somatostatin analogues may be administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition comprising the somatostatin analogue in free form or in pharmaceutically acceptable salt or complex form in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. Suitably they are put up in a form suitable for injection, e.g. for parenteral administration.Alternatively they may be put up in the form of creams or ointments or solutions for topical application or in tablet or capsule form for systemic application.Suitable forms for injection may be prepared in accordance with standard techniques, e.g. in accordance with the following example EXAMPLEThe following ingredients are employed to prepare injection solutions comprising 0.025, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.5 mg active ingredient SMS ml .
