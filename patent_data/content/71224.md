# Process for producing peroxydicarconates.

## Abstract
The invention covered relates to an improved, solvent free process for the continuous manufacture of peroxydicar bonate polymerization catalysts. The improvement in the process is the mere decanting of the reaction product through a filtering medium into a separation zone, decanting to a washing zone, decanting to a second separation zone and then taking the product up in an aqueous medium containing a suitable emulsifying agent whereby the resul tant initiator or catalyst emulsion can be conveniently and safely stored until ready for use in a polymerization reaction.
