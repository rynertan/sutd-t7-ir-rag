# Ophthalmic irrigating solution.

## Abstract
An ophthalmic irrigating solution useful for irrigating the human eye contains sodium, potassium, magnesium, cal cium chloride, and bicarbonate ions as well as dextrose and glutathione in proportions consistent with the osmotic stability and continued metabolism of the endothelial cells. The irrigating solution is prepared by mixing a first basic solution which provides the bicarbonate and a second acidic solution which provides the calcium, magnesium, dextrose and glutathione. The first and second solutions may be stored as stable sterile solutions for extended periods of time and mixed within 24 hours of use.
