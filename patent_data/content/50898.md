## Description
Compact ValveThis invention relates to valves in general and more particularly to a compact check valve and in a preferred embodiment a compact combined check and pressure reducing regulating valve.In a system utilizing gas from a high pressure cylinder for example, for the supply of carbon dioxide therefrom, it is usual to provide coupling means connecting the cylinder to a supply line, a valve controlling the on off supply of high pressure gas through the supply line, and a pressure regulator for causing a reduction in pressure between the cylinder outlet and a gas consumption point in the system. The valve is arranged to be opened selectively when the coupling is made between the cylinder and supply line. The regulator is normally located in the supply line.In various applications, there is a need for the coupling to be a quick release coupling, enabling quick connection of the supply line to and from such a cylinder. One construction of a quick release coupling is disclosed inUnited States Patent Application Serial No. 200,020 a co inventor of which is the inventor of the invention disclosed herein. In the device disclosed therein the valve is a check valve installed in the cylinder. The coupling is such that when made, a member is inserted into an appropriate bore in the cylinder in a sealing manner and opens the check valve to immediately permit the flow of gas, a separate valve not being necessary. Integral with the member inserted into the bore but external to the cylinder is a regulating valve.The valve disclosed in said U.S. Application Serial No.200,020, extends almost fully across the neck of the gas cylinder. However, it is sometimes desired to insert an elongated device or member such as a level sensor through the neck of the cylinder, in which case it is not possible to use a valve as disclosed in said U.S. Application.Furthermore, the use of an external regulator further adds to the cost of the installation.In accordance with the present invention, in order to permit a device such as a level sensor to extend through the neck of a gas cylinder, a special type of valve, hereinafter sometimes referred to as a pancake valve, which gives the necessary clearance for the sensor or similar axial element, to be inserted into the gas cylinder, is provided. Furthermore, there is also disclosed such a valve which also incorporates means for regulating and pressure reducing thereby avoiding the need for a separate regulator external to the cylinder.According to the invention there is provided a valve which and is for use in an opening in the neck of a gas cylinder and which does not obstruct a clear passage along the axis of said cylinder comprising a a first valve member for positioning in fixedly and outwardly disposed position in said opening in a sealing manner b a second valve member for positioning in movably and inwardly disposed position in said opening, one of said valve members forming a valve seat surface and the other a sealing edge and c means acting against and biasing said second member against said first member.The invention further provides a valve which is for use in an opening in the neck of a gas cylinder and which does not obstruct a clear passage along the axis of said cylinder comprising a a hollow annular nut having on the inside thereof an internal annular projection with a sharp edge, said nut being for screwing into said opening in said neck b a valve seat member comprising a cup shaped member having an outwardly extending flange at its open end, the base of said cup shaped member forming a valve seat surface which cooperates with said annular projection with a sharp edge and c means acting against said flange and biasing said cupshaped member against said annular projection on said nut.Embodiments of the present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein Fig. 1 is a cross section of a fitting when attached to a cylinder which may be used with the present invention Fig. 2 is a cross sectional view of a valve according to the present invention adapted for insertion into the fitting of Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is a cross sectional view of a valve of the general type disclosed in Fig. 2, which also permits regulating andFig. 4 illustrates a modified version of the valve of Fig. 3.Normally, when a valve forms part of a quick release coupling and is utilized with a fitting in a gas cylinder, it extends all the way across the fitting. However, such is not possible when a sensor assembly or the like must extend along the axis of the fitting. Thus, a valving mechanism which can be contained within a smaller depth, i.e., essentially within the wall thickness of the fitting or cylinder neck is desirable in such a case.Furthermore, fittings of this nature usually contain a pressure relief mechanism such as a burst disc assembly adapted to burst under conditions of excessive pressure.As illustrated by the cross section of Fig. 1 the fitting 41 contains, in addition to an opening 47 for a valving mechanism and an opening 49 for a sensor or the like, an opening 71 for containing the burst disc assembly.This opening is threaded and the conventional assembly with a burst disc may be screwed therein. The fitting 41 is shown screwed to a high pressure cylinder 40 and sealed thereto by means of a seal 93.A pancake valve forming part of a quick release coupling is shown in cross sectional view in Fig. 2. It includes a valve seat member 73. This is essentially a cup shaped member having an annular flange 75. Cup shaped valve seat member 73 contains an interior projection 77 forming an actuator, which is either screwed or press fitted therein. A spring 78 biases member 73 outwardly acting between the flange 75 and a surface 79 on s threaded part SO of the valve. Part 80 contains an interior annular projection 81 with a sharp edge 83 which, in the closed position, abuts against the bottom surface 85 of member 73 which is covered with a valve seat 86 of hard rubber or the like. Part SO is in the nature of a hollow externally threaded annular nut which is screwed into appropriate threads in the opening 47. As an alternative to forming surfaces 79 on part 80 they may be on the fitting 41 so that when part 80 is screwed into place, the spring 78 biases the cup shaped part 73 against the sharp edge 83 of the annular inward projection 81. See Fig. 3. Such surfaces are shown inFig. 1. In either case the biasing of spring 78 closes the valve. When the valve is coupled to the other part of the coupling a connection is made, the other coupling part having a pin which pushes against the projection 77 to move the member 73, acting against the biasing force of the spring 78, to lift the seat 86 away from the sharp edge 83 of annular projection 81.Gas can then flow from inside the fitting 41 around the member 73 and or through a plurality of ports 87 formed in the walls of member 73 and thence thhrough the central opening 89 in the outer part of the valve. Of course, appropriate sealing will be provided between part 80 and the other part of the coupling. Such a quick release coupling of which one part includes a conventional valve structure is shown, for example, in said copending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 200,020.The combination of this type of valve, in a fitting such as the fitting 41, along with a sensor assembly provides a particularly advantageous gas cylinder package which can be easily connected and disconnected and in which it is easy to determine when the cylinder is almost exhausted and needs to be replaced. It is a further advantage, if the neck of the cylinder is extended and formed appropriately to receive the parts which, in the illustrated embodiment are installed in the fitting 41.In such a case, the fitting 41 simply becomes part of the neck of the cylinder and for example the level sensor burst disc assembly and the valve part of quick release coupling are installed directly in the neck of the bottle avoiding the need for a separate fitting 41. Such a gas cylinder is disclosed in copending U.S. ApplicationSerial No. 200,022. It is also noted that the compact valve of the present invention may be used in other applications where the space along the axis of the cylinder must be kept clear for installation of other apparatus.A further development of the valve of Figs. 1 and 2 is illustrated in Fig. 3. In Fig. 3, identical parts are given the same reference numeral. The valve of Fig.3, in addition to beig part of a quick release coupling and acting as a check valve, also functions as a regulator valve. In the illustrated embodiment, the spring 78 acts between the flange 75 and a flange 79a formed in the wall of the fitting 90, or on the wall of a cylinder, rather than between the flange 75 and a flange on a nut 80. Nut 80, in this case, is split into parts 80a and 80b. Part 80b is inserted or threaded into the inner end of bore 47 and contains the portion 81 with the sharp edge 83. The manner in which edge 83 cooperates with the valve seat 86 is as before. Rather than utilizing a directly acting member such as the projection 77 an actuator in the form of a tubular member 77a with a central bore 76 forming an outlet passage is provided. Tubular member 77a is supported for axial motion by a diaphragm 87.The diaphragm is secured between the part 80b and the threaded nut part 80a and divides the bore into an inner chamber 93 and outer chamber 101. Part 80a is sealed in the opening 47 by means of an O ring seal 88. An axially movable support surface in the form of an annular disc 91 is provided and is capable of axial movement within the outer chamber 101 formed within the part 80a. A biasing spring 102 extends between support surface 91 and diaphragm 87.In a rest position, support surface 91 is thus biased against a flange 95 formed at the outside of the nut part 80a. The flange is defined at one edge by an entrance opening or bore 97. Ports 99 of a radial nature are formed in the tubular member 77a. Ports 99 couple inner chamber 93 to bore 76 forming the outlet passage. During operation, a probe 103 on the other part of the quick release coupling is inserted into the bore 97. It is provided with an O ring seal or the like 105 sealing against the tubular member 77a. Insertion causes the axially movable support surface 91 to move inward. The inward movement of the support surface 91 results in a similar inward movement of the diaphragm and with it the tubular member 77a. This moves the valve seat surface 86 away from the sharp edge 83 against the force of the biasing spring 78.This permits a flow around the cupshaped member 73 and into the chamber 93. Flow from the chamber 93 through the ports 99 and bore 76 takes place.The flow continues out from the cylinder through the probe 103. However, as gas is admitted to the chamber 93 it acts on the diaphragm 87 to offset the force of the spring .107. The tubular member 77a thus tends to move outwardly closing off the valve formed between the sharp edge 83 and the valve seat 86. In this manner regulation and pressure reducing takes place with the valve so formed opening and closing to maintain a pressure at the chamber 93, and thus at the outlet, which is determined by the strength of the spring 107 and the position of the support surface 91.This position is in turn determined by the position of a nut 111 threaded on the probe 103. A lock nut 113 is provided so that once the desired pressure is established it may be maintained. Fig. 4 illustrates an alternative manner of implementing the regulator and pressure reducing valve. In tliis device, a nut 80c which is an integral unit and equivalent to the parts 80a and 80b of Fig. 3 is used. In this embodiment, a spring 107 acts between the support surface 91 and a rigid annular member 87a attached to the tubular member 77a. A seal 115 is inserted at the edge of the rigid member 87a.Member 87a works as a piston and, again, the member 77a is free to move inward and outward axially.Thus, a relatively compact unit which is part of a quick release coupling is a check valve, and at the same time acts as a regulating, pressure reducing valve is provided in a single unit.The valve of the invention can be embodied in an arrangement which is not a quick release coupling.
