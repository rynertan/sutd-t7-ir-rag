## Description
CONSTANT ORDER RELEASE, SOLID DOSAGE INDOMETHACIN FORMULATION AND METHOD OF TREATING ARTHRITIS AND OTHER INFLAMMATORY CONDITIONS The present invention relates to an improved pharmaceutical formulation for indomethacin and more particularly relates to a solid dosage, constant order release indomethacin formulation. The number of people who have arthritis is increasing.It is currently estimated that between 35 40 million people in the United States alone, or one in every seven individuals, have arthritic symptoms which require medical treatment. There will be one person every thirty three seconds who will develop symptomatic arthritis and need medical treatment. Even with the introduction of newer, non steroidal drugs, such as indomethacin, naproxen, fenoprofen, ibuprofen and the like, aspirin remains the primary drug of choice for the treatment of the arthritic patient. However, there are some inflammatory joint diseases that are not easily managed with aspirin alone or where aspirin may not be indicated.These special situations are acute gouty arthritis, rheumetoid spondylitis and severe degenerative osteoarthritis of the hip. When aspirin alone is ineffective, or cannot be tolerated, the non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs are used.The non steroidal anti inflammatory agents fall into three distinct chemical categories as noted in the reference pharmacology textbook, Goodman and Gilman, The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 6th Edition, Section V, Chapter 28, pages 705713 1 indole acetic acid derivatives which include indomethacin, a methylated indole derivative and sulindac, a fluromethinyl sulfinyl indole derivative 2 fenamates, a family of aspirin like drugs that are derivatives of N phenylanthranilic acid, ncluding mefenamic, meclofenamic, flufenamic, tolfenamic and etofenamic acids and 3 propionic acid derivatives.The latter group comprises the most common and widely used forms of non steroidal phenylalkanoic acids and presently in clues ibuprofen, naproxen, fenoprofen, flurbiprofen and ketoprofen. While these compounds share common pharmacological behavior, they are distinct chemical entities, and because of their differences in chemical structure, pharmaceutical formulations that are appropriate for one or several of the above compounds, are not necessarily operable for all groups or for all members of a given group. Indomethacin was the first commercially available, non steroidal anti inflammatory agent in the United States, and the product met with enormous commercial success. However, while the drug is more potent than aspirin as an anti inflammatory agent, and has been found to possess analgesic properties as well, the severe side effects, particularly the severe gastrointestinal side effects which, on occassion have resulted in patient deaths, created a need for alternative therapy and resulted in the development and introduction of other nonsteroidal anti inflammatory agents. However, despite its side effects, indomethacin is a very valuable therapeutic agent for conditions which do not respond to salicylate treatment, and considerable work has been done to provide improved formulations of the drug with lessened side effects. See for example United States PatentNos. 4,173,626 4,228,160 and 4,228,161. Much of the prior work concentrated on sustained release indomethacin preparations as methacrylic acid ester beads. See Dittgen et al Pharmazie 32 3 p.185 1977 inChemical Abstracts 87 11555g 1977 , Garcia Diss. Abstr. Int. B 38 2 pp.602 3 1977 in Chemical Abstracts 87 161724a 1977 ,Dittgen et al Gyogyszergszet 20 7 pp.260 262 1976 in ChemicalAbstracts 87 189376h 1977 Kala et al, Pharmazie 31 11 pp. 783 9 1976 in Chemical Abstracts 86 60497c 1977 and Dittgen et al Gyogyszergszet 20 71 pp.260 2 1976 in Chemical Abstracts 85 198123p 1976 . United States Patent No. 4 73,626 discloses a sus tained release indomethacin capsule containing uncoated indomethacin pellets, indomethacin pellets coated with a slow dissolving material and non medicated pellets. United States Patent No. 4,228,161 discloses an anti inflammatory combination having reduced ulcerogenicity comprising indomethacin and a phenylbenzoic acid compound. United States Patent No. 4,228,160 provides a complex of cyclodextrin and indomethacin which is taught to have substantially reduced ulcergenicity. It is clear that the prior art has been concerned with reducing the ulcergenicity of indomethacin, and that while a vast body of prior art exists in the field of sustained release, buffered, enteric coated and like formulations, there has not been a simple solution to the problem posed by indomethacin. The present invention provides an improved indomethacin formulation. Specifically, a constant release rate, solid dosage form indomethacin tablet having lessened gastrointestinal side effects, and which is simpler and less costly to produce. The present invention provides a constant release rate indomethacin tablet which may be administered once or twice daily and which has lessened side effects over the existing, commercially available capsule dosage formulations.The constant release tablet contains a therapeutically effective amount of indomethacin admixed with a slow dissolving, water insoluble cellulose derivative a disintegrating agent, and a bulking agent or diluent. Coloring agents or dyes as well as a tablet lubricant and the like can also be included. The constant release rate indomethacin tablet of the present invention comprises an intimate admixture of a therapeutically effective amount of indomethacin, from about 1.7 to 3.7, and preferably 2 to 3 weight percent of a slowdissolving, water insoluble cellulose derivative, such as cellulose acetate phthalate, ethyl cellulose and the like, from about 1.5 to 5.0, preferably 1.9 to 3.2 weight percent of a disintegrant such as corn starch, methyl cellulose, hydrophobic cellulose derivatives, alginic acid or a saccharide such as lactose, maltose or fructose, and from 40 80 weight percent, preferably 55 75weight percent of a pharmaceutically acceptable bulking agent or diluent. In addition, the tablet may include a coloring agent or dye, as well as lubricants and the like. Preferably, each tablet contains from 50 200 mg of indomethacin and weighs from about 270 to 646 mg, respectively.Generally, for ease of administration, tablets will contain 50, 75, 100, 150 or 200 mg of indomethacin per tablet. Tablets containing 50 mg of indomethacin will weigh approximately 270 mg, tablets containing 100 mg of indomethacin will weigh approximately 538 mg and tablets containing 200 mg of indomethacin will weigh approximately 646 mq. The preferred slow dissolving, water insoluble cellulose derivatives are cellulose acetate phthalate and ethyl cellulose alone, or in combination with each other. Other such derivatives are well known in the art and include methyl cellulose, powdered cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose and the like. Corn starch and lactose are the preferred disintegrating agents and dibasic calcium phosphate is the preferred bulking agent or diluent. Other suitable diluents include calcium phosphate, tricalcium phosphate, calcium sulfate, spraydried lactose, anhydrous lactose, mannitol, sorbitol, microcrystalline cellulose, acacia, gelatin, sucrose, ammonium calcium alginate, alginic acid, starches, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sodium carboxy methyl cellulose and the like. It is generally desirable to include from 0.3 to 1.5 weight percent, preferably from 0.5 to 0.9 weight percent of a lubricant in the tablet formulation of the present invention. The term constant release rate, as used herein, refers to a formulation wherein the in vitro release of indomethacin from the tablet, using a U.S.P. dissolution apparatus, pH 7.5, is constant and linear against time until all of the drug is released when plotted on an x,y graph using the formula dc wherein K constant, dc decreasing concentration and dt decreasing time, a straight line is formed. Calculation of the data points by linear regression analysis should give a value of 0.85 to 1.0. A value cf 1.0 is a perfect straight line. The preparation of the indomethacin tablets of the present invention is simple, straight forward and results in a significant savings in production costs, and hence costs to the patient, over presently available capsule formulations . Generally speaking, constant release rate indomethacin tablets are advantageously prepared by dissolving the slow dissolving, water insoluble cellulose derivative in a suitable solvent and carefully admixing the solution with a dry blended powder of indomethacin, a disintegrating agent and a diluent to form a wet granulation. The granulation is dried, screened through a 14 20 mesh screen, and the sized granules are then compressed in a rotary or single station punch press. For ease of tabletting, it is preferred to add a lubricant such as magnesium stearate to the dried granules prior to tabletting. The preferred solvent is a l l v v mixture of isopropyl alcohol and methylene chloride. Other suitable solvents include, but are not limited to lower aliphatic alcohols such as methanol, n propanol, ethanol, denatured alcohol, acetone, methyl ethyl acetate and non chlorinated hydrocarbons. Since indomethacin may undergo a yellowish color change on exposure to light, a coloring agent of the yellow series may be added to mask this slight color alteration.Alternatively, the tablets may be film coated after compression to prevent this light induced alteration. The tablets of the present invention did not show any discoloration when placed in bright sunlight for 30 days as long as they remained in a light resistant container. Turning to the preferred process of the present invention, the cellulose derivative, preferably cellulose acetate phthalate, is dissolved and dispersed in a solvent, preferably isopropyl alcohol methylene chloride l l v v , which is used to make a wet granulation. The amount of cellulose derivative may range from 1.7 3.7 weight percent of the final tablet weight, and preferably from 2 3 weight percent. Generally from about 15 to 25 weight percent of solvent, based on the total weight of the formulation, and preferably from about 16 to 22 weight percent is employed. The cellulose derivative and solvent are blended until the cellulose derivative is completely dispersed and clarity of solution has been obtained. Generally, it takes between 35 40 minutes per 125 liters of fluid, using a lightening blender, to effect solution. The granulating fluid is then added to dry blendedU.S.P. indomethacin, 16 200 mesh and preferably 40 80 mesh, a bulking agent and adisintegrant, in a slow, steady stream, preferably at a rate no faster than 3 minutes per liter of solution.If the fluid is added too rapidly, it is difficult to obtain an even granulation. Following the addition of the cellulose solution, blending is continued for from about 3 to 12 minutes, preferably 3.5 to 6 minutes per kilogram of material. It is critical that the wet granulation be completely dried before screening. Failure to observe this technique may result in rupture of the granules and a loss of the constant release rate profile. In conventional prior art tabletting procedures, the wet granulations are generally screened immediately after formation and then dried. However, if the prior art processes are employed, the constant release rate profile of the indomethacin tablets of the present invention may be destroyed. It is preferable to maintain the humidity below 50 both during the granulating and tabletting processes. Indomethacin tablets made in this manner do not exhibit the proclivity for gastro intestinal irritation which is a notable feature of regular indomethacin. They perform in a ccnstant release rate manner in vitro as previously noted. Because of the unique and superior constant release rate properties, indomethacin tablets made by the described process and ingredients can be administered once or possibly twice a day to provide 24 hour suppression of pain and inflammation. Example 1 Indomethacin tablets weighing 538 mg and containing 100 mg of indomethacin were prepared from the following formulation and by the following process. Ingredient Amount Indomethacin, U.S.P., 80mesh 100gm Dibasic Calcium Phosphate 400gm Corn Starch l0gm Cellulose Acetate Phthalate 14gm Isopropyl Alcohol 100ml Methylene Chloride 100ml Magnesium Stearate 4gm The indomethacin, dibasic calcium phosphate and corn starch were dry blended in a Hobart mixer. The dissolved cellulose acetate phthalate was slowly added until a wet granulation was formed. The material was discharged onto paper lined trays and dried overnight. The granules were then screened through a number 16 screen and blended with magnesium stearate. The granulate was then compressed into tablets using a rotary press. Each tablet weighed 528 mg and contained 100 mg of indomethacin with a tablet hardness of 10kip. Example 2 Indomethacin tablets containing 100 mg of indomethacin were prepared from the following formulation. Ingredient Amount Indomethacin, U.S.P., 80 mesh 100gm Dibasic Calcium Phosphate 400gm Anhydrous Lactose 10gm Opadry Blue non enteric lOgm Cellulose Acetate Phthalate lOgm Ethyl Cellulose 4gm Isopropyl Alcohol 100ml Methylene Chloride 100ml Magnesium Stearate 4gm In this formulation the indomethacin, dibasic calcium phosphate, lactose and opadry blue were dry blended for 10 minutes in a Hobart mixer. The cellulose derivatives were then dissolved and dispersed in the solvents. The granulating fluid was then added to the dry blended powder. Blending was carried out until a wet granular mass was well formed. The granulate was then discharged onto paper lined trays and dried overnight. Following the drying process the granules were screened through a 16 mesh screen, blended with magnesium stearate and compressed on a rotary tablet press. Each 538 mg tablet contained 100 mg of indomethacin and had a hardness of 10 kp. Example 3 Constant release rate indomethacin tablets were made from the following formulation. Ingredient Amount Indomethacin, U.S.P., 80 mesh 100gm Dibasic Calcium Phosphate 400gm Corn Starch 10gm Opadry Yellow non enteric 10gm Cellulose Acetate Phthalate 14gm Isopropyl Alcohol 100ml Methylene Chloride 100ml Magnesium Stearate 3gm The indomethacin, dibasic calcium phosphate, corn starch and opadry yellow were placed in a Hobart mixer and dry blended for 10 minutes. The cellulose acetate phthalate was dissolved and dispersed in the solvents. After complete dissolution the solvent was added to the powder with complete mixing until a wet granulation was formed. The granulate was discharged onto paper lined trays and dried overnight. After complete drying the granulation was reduced by screening through a number 16 mesh screen. The material was blended with magnesium stearate and compressed into tablets on a rotary press.Each 537 mg tablet contained 100 mg of indomethacin and had a hardness of 10 kp. Example 5 To demonstrate that the product does not have a tendency to dissolve in the stomach the following disintegration test was done using tablets made from Example 3. Table 1 Tablets Residue After 6 Hours Disintegration, U.S.P. Basket Apparatus, No 2 Disks Gastric Acid pH 1.2 Start Weight 6 hours Residue Remaining mg weight mg 6 hours 539 mg 490 mg 90.91 540 mg 492 mg 90.118 536 mg 488 mg 91.04 537 mg 493 mg 91.648 538 mg 487 mg 90.528 539 mg 490 mg 90.918 538.2 mg 490.0 mg 91.02 Table 2 Intestinal Fluid pH 7.5 Start Weight 6 hours Residue Remaining mg weight mg 6 hours 540 mg 108 mg 20.0 537 mg 105 mg 19.6 536 mg 100 mg 18.7 541 mg 110 mg 20.3 538 mg 106 mg 19.7 539 mg 107 mg 19.9 538.5 mg 106 mg 19.7 These studies suggest that the indomethacin tablets made by the present invention are relatively resistant to disintegration in an acid media.In a neutral pH which is found beyond the stomach in the small intestine a slow, steady erosion of the tablet system is noted. Example 6 While the tablets showed a steady constant erosion, to be considered a true constant release rate formulation requires testing by dissolution. Tablets made by Example 1 were placed in an approved U.S.P. dissolution apparatus and assayed for indomethacin content. Twenty tablets were randomly weighed and the average tablet weight was 537.3 mg. The amount of indomethacin per tablet was reported as 94.2 mg. Dissolution was carried out using U.S.P. apparatus II, pH 7.5 150 RPM at 37 c.

This data demonstrates that tablets made from the present formulation have a constant release rate profile and have little disintegration or tablet disruption in gastric acid. The present formulation provides relatively low, sustained serum blood levels of indomethacin yet effectively inhibits prostaglandin synthesis and relieves pain and inflammation without the severity of gastric side effects encountered with present formulations.
