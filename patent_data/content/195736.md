# Accumulator injector.

## Abstract
An accumulator injector 10 employs a shuttle piston assembly 90 to produce a pilot injection prior to the primary fuel injection of the injector 10 and to control the injection rate. The shuttle piston 90 communicates with the control chamber 58 and the accumulator chamber 86 of the injector to provide a controllable pressure bleed means for controlling the valve needle 70 lift of the injector 10 .
