# Foldable and portable vehicle with foldable handlebar.

## Abstract
A foldable, portable bicycle in which the handlebar, its elongated post, the seat assembly, the pedal crank and the frame are foldable quickly and easily into a compact and regular shaped package that is easily portable and storable, and are unfoldable with similar speed and ease into a safe, durable and comfortable bicycle that accommodates adults of normal size. The frame is designed with a low profile that is substantially the same height and thickness as the dimensions of the wheels and their supports, and the handlebar and seat assemblies extend upwardly to normal height, but fold and collapse, along with the pedals, to substantially within the confines outlined by the folded frame. The handlebar assembly has an elongated steering post that is hinged at its lower end on a vertically compact bearing to fold into a laterally offset position along one side of the wheel, and also is turned to dispose the handlebar in a front to rear position when folded, to lie compactly within the folded frame. The post is longitudinally extendable from a length approximately the same as the diameter of the front wheel to a substantially greater length.
