## Description
PACKAGED PACKAGED SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE WHICH PROVIDES FOR ENHANCED POWER DISSIPATION by William S. hy BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to a packaged semiconductor device and particularly to a packaged semi conductor device which provides for enhanced power dis sipation.2. Background of the Invention Conventional transfer molded epoxy and silicone dual in line packages for semiconductor devices ofrer major cost advantages over ceramic or metallic packages at the expense of high thermal impedence. Recent developments in the field of metallurgy have resulted in the availability of materials having a thermal conductivity which approaches that of copper 2700 BTU sq. ft. hr. F. in. and a coefficient of thermal expansion which approximates that of silicon 1.8 x 10 in. in. F. . The close match of expansion coefficient permits die attdch of silicon integrated circuit devices to the material by use of conventional interface metals or alloys without cracking or otherwise degrading the electrical properties of the device due to the effects of mechanical stress. The present invention provides a new package structure for a semiconductor device which is based upon existing and widely used lead frame techniques for plastic packages, which new structure provides lower thermal impedence than conventional package structures. A preferred structure provides lower junction to ambient e JA temperature rise in terms of degrees Centigrade per watt than commonly used ceramic dual in line counterparts. While cost to manufacture the new package is somewhat higher than present plastic dual in line packages, a significant cost advantage over existing ceramic dual in line packages is realized.

DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Packages for semic onductor devices are made in a variety of forms such as dual in line.packages, edge mounted packages and flat packs. The present invention is illus trated herein with respect to a dual in line package, although it is in no way limited to such a configuration . Figs. 1 and 2 show a conventional plastic dual in line package 10. Mounted within this package are a semiconductor device 14, for example, an integrated circuit device, and a plurality of electrically conducting metal leads 12 which extend from the periphery of the package 10 and are bent over at their ends to form connectors. A package of this type is thus adapted for plugging into a circuit board or the like by inserting the male leads into female receivers formed on the board. In forming various types of semiconductor packages, including the one shown in Figs. 1 and 2, it is common to utilize a lead frame such as the frame 11 shown in Fig. 3. The frame 11 is formed of thin metal and includes a central mounting pad 16 and at least one pad support member 15 which extends to a rim 13 formed about the frame. Metal leads 22 extend inwardly from the rim 13 into close proximity to the mounting pad 16. The inner portion 24 of these leads are commonly referred to as lead fingers. In it the conventional dual in line package shown in Figs. 1 and 2, as well as in various other types of packages for semiconductor devices, a semiconductor device 14 is mounted on the central pad 16 and fine wires 18, which typically are either gold or aluminum are connected between device con tacts and the lead fingers 24 of the leads 22. An encap sulation material, for example, an epoxy resin or a high purity silicone plastic, is utilized to encapsulate the device 14 and the wires 18. The encapsulation material may be applied by transfer molding techniques which are well in in the art. The molding operation is is accomplished by the application of heat and pressure to a mold to produce the desired exterior package configuration. The exterior rim 13 of the frame is then removed.In the case of a dual in line package, the outer ends of the leads 22 are bent as illustrated in Fig. 2 to form a package that may be plugged oR S D into a circuit board. The packaged semiconductor device of the present in vention is shown in Fig. 6. A mounting pad 100 which is formed from a low expansion, high thermal conductivity material has a semiconductor device 102 mounted thereon.The mounting pad material has a thermal conductivity which is within abount 20 that of copper and a coefficient of thermal expansion which is within abount 20 that of silicon. A material of the type just described is manufactered by Semi Alloys Incorporated, Mount Vernon,New York. Pad support means 15 are attached to the mounting pad 100. A plurality of metal leads 108 having short lead fingers 109 extend into close proximity to the mounting pad 100. The leads 108 are electrically connected to the semiconductor device 102 by wires 104. A plastic encapsulation 106 encloses the mounting pad 100 and the semiconductor dice 102 and extends laterally beyond the lead fingers 109 such that the ends of the leads 108 extend from the enapsualtion 106 as connectors for the packaged semiconductor device Fig. 7 .. Conventional lead frames such as that shown inFig. 3 may be utilized in the manufacture of the packaged semiconductor device of the present invention by adding one punch station to remove the mounting pad 16 thereof as illustrated in Fig. 4. The lead frame can be manufactured from a low cast material such as cold rolled steel. Lead frames formed of cold rolled steel would result in not only improved thermal conductance through the lead frame but also extended life of the stamping tool. Following removal of the mounting pad 16, the thermally conducti ng material 100 is attached to the remaining and support means 15 by welding, diffusion bond, or other well known techniques. Fig. 8 and 9 show a preferred, embodiment of the packaged semiconductor device of the present invention. A mounting pad 200 formed from the above described low expansion, high thermal conductivity material has an upper surface 200a and a lower surface 200b. A semiconductor device 202 is mounted centrally on the upper surface 200a of mounting pad 200. Pad support means 15 are attached to the mounting pad 200 at the periphery of its upper surface 200a.A plurality of metal leads 208 having short lead fingers 209 extend into close proximity to the mounting pad 200. The leads 208 are electrically connected to the semiconductor device 202 by wires 204 An encapsulation 206 encloses the mounting pad 200 such that the upper surface 200a of the mounting pad 200 and the semiconductor device 202 are encapsulated while the lower surface 260b of the mounting pad 200 is exposed to an .operational environment. As shown in Fig.. 8 and 9 it is preferred that the lower surface of the encapsulationEMI7.1 be coplanar with the lower surface 200b of the mounting pad 200. The operational enviromment may be either still air or moving air. The structure shown in Figs. 8.and 9 exnoses the high thermal conductivity material to the assembly environment and provides a superior thermal path for dissipation of heat generated in device Qoeraiìon. The packag ed semiconductor device of the present invention provides several advantages over prior art devices such as lower cost as compared to ceramic packages, the ability to utilize existing tooling in its maintenance, and the ability to package higher power devices in plastic.
