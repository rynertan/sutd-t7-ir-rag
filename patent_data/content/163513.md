# A television apparatus using non interlaced scanning format.

## Abstract
A television signal 130 is delayed both by a first field delay 400 and a second field delay 400 . A frame delay luminance signal Y fr and a field delayed luminance signal y fd are thus produced. The frame delayed and field delayed signals are combined by a combiner 412 to produce a first luma signal Ym and a second luma signal Yfd is produced from the field delayed signal Yfd . The first and second luma signals are displayed in a non interlaced manner. The field delayed signal Yfd is pro duced by a line interpolator 404 . The frame delayed signal is produced by a frameinterpolator 400,400 405 . A motion detector 406, 407, 408 detects frame to frame picture motion. The combiner 412 combines the field delayed Y fd and frame delayed Yfr signals is dependence upon the motion as detected by the detector. Preferably, the signals are combined proportionally to the motion so that in the presence of motion, the picture is derived more from the field delayed signal than from the frame delayed signal.
