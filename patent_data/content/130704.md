# ROLL PROFILE GAUGE

## Abstract
The surfaces of worn and ground rolls are profiled by an electronic processor based gauge 12 which is easily mounted on a roll grinding machine 10 . A fluidic sensor 52 within the gauge determines the distance to the roll surface. The change in roll diameter is detected by changes of air gap between sensor and roll surface 18 . The electronic processor 12 automatically produces a linear scale of the roll profile on a chart recorder 118 . Two fixed spherical elements 80 are mounted on a V shaped frame member 38, 40 which contact the roll.
