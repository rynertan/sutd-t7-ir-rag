# Electronically controlled coil assembly.

## Abstract
Electronically controlled coil assembly for use in electri cal and electronic applications such as tuned circuits, transformers, and devices, which require or utilize a moving magnetic field. The coil assembly comprises a plurality of electrical conductors 28 carried by a substrate 21 with electronically controlled elements 31 for controlling the windings, which are energized or connected into a circuit. Embodiments are disclosed, in which the coil assembly is constructed both in printed circuit form and in microminia ture form.
