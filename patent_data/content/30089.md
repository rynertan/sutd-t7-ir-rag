# Detergent composition and method for producing it.

## Abstract
A particulate alkaline detergent composition is disclosed Which is suitable for washing fabrics and exhibiting good detergency, stability and bleaching while the level of inor ganic material deposited on the fabrics is at an acceptably low level. The composition comprises a synthetic detergent active, a mixture of tri polyphosphate and orthophosphate in the ratio of 20 1 to 3 1 and a mixture of a peroxygen bleach such as perborate and a bleach activator such as tet raacetylethylenediamine. The phosphates constitute from 10 to 40 of the composition while the bleach system consti tutes from 5 to 30 . The amount of pyrophosphate, if any, should be kept below 5 . Soap may be added to the com position. The compositions may be prepared by mixing the bleach system and optionally the alkali metal phosphate with a spray dried powder containing the remaining constituents.
