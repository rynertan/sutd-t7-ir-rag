## Description
SUSTAINED HIGH LEVEL PRODUCTION OF RECOMBINANT HUMAN GAMMA INTERFERON USING A BOVINE PAPILLOMAVIRUS VECTOR This invention relates to a process for producing recombinant human immune interferon. More particularly, the invention relates to a process for production of recombinant human immune interferon in mammalian cell expression systems using a bovine papillomavirus shuttle vector. Interferon is a glycoprotein whose synthesis in cells is principally induced by viruses or mitogens.Interferons are classified into three major species designated IFN a leukocyte , IFN ss fibroblast , and IFN y immune . Interferons possess potent antiviral, anticellular, immunoregulatory, and antitumor activities. Interferon treatment of cancer and viral infections in animals has met with some success. Consequently, immune interferon is of great interest clinically as well as academically. In general, recombinant DNA techniques have now become well known. See Methods In Enzvmoloav, Academic Press Volumes 65 and 68 1979 100 and 101 1983 and the references cited therein, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. An extensive technical discussion embodying most commonly used recombinantDNA methodologies can be found in Maniatis, et al., Molecular Cloning, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory 1982 . Genes coding for various polypeptides may be cloned by incorporating a bNA fragment coding for the poiypeptide in a recombinant DNA vehicle, e.g., bacterial or viral vectors, followed by transformation of a suitable host. Previously, this host was primarily an Escherichia coli 5,colt cell line.However, with the development of eukaryotic viral vectors, it is now possible to reintroduce cloned genes into their natural environment where mechanisms involved in control of gene expression and developmental regulations can be tested. An important application of eukaryotic vectors is the production of biologically active gene products suitable for pharmacological use. Several methods are currently in use for delivering defined foreign deoxyribonucleic acid DNA segments into eukaryotic cells. These include physical injection of DNA Mueller, C., A.Graessmann, and M. Graessmann, Cell 1978 15 579 , fusion of DNA containing liposomes Dimitriadis, G.J., Nature London 1978 274 923 or erythrocytes Rechsteiner, M., Natl. Cancer Inst. Monoor. 1978 48 57 with target cells, and the direct application of naked DNA onto cells in the presence of calcium phosphate Graham,F.L., and A.J. van der Eb. Viroloov 1973 52 456 and marker DNA Mantei, N., B. Werner and C.Weissmann, Nature, London 1979 281 40 M.Wigler, et al., Cell 1977 11 223 and B. Wold, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1979 , 76 5684 . More recently, insertion of DNA into recipient cells was achieved by using viral particles Simian virus 40 SV40 in which a segment of the viral genome is covalently linked to defined nucleic acid segments Gruss, P., and G. Khoury, Proc. Natl.Acad. Sci. 1981 78 133 Hamer, D.H., and P.Leder, Nature 1979 , 281 35 40 and R.C. Mulligan, et al., Nature London 1979 277 108 . Whereas the SV40 vector system offers a rapid and efficient way to introduce foreign DNAs into permissive host cells, the system is limited by the size of DNA that can be accomodated within the virus particle.Moreover, since monkey cells are permissive forSV40 replication, infection by recombinant SV40 particles culminates iaefledeath. SV4o DNA has not yet been exploited as a cloning vector in nonpermissive rodent cells, because i SV40 transformation is associated with integration of the viral genome, a process that may disrupt the integrity of the foreign DNA segment of interest, and ii there is no indication that the genfLwiLbx active at detectable levels from the low integrated copy numbers which are sufficient for the expression of the SV40 transforming gene. The use of bovine papillomavirus BPV DNA as a viral vector is well documented and was originally based on the observation that the viral genome persists as an extrachromosomal plasmid in transformed cells Law, M. F., D.R. Lowy, I.Dvoretzky, and P.M. Howley, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.,USA 78 2727 2731, 1981 . In this form, the cloned gene is maintained in a uniform sequence environment of the BPV minichromosome eliminating potential problems associated with the integration of the cloned DNA into inactive regions of the host chromosome. This property was fully exploited in the establishment of BPV shuttle vectors capable of replicating in prokaryote and eukaryotic cells Sarver, N., J.C. Byrne, and P.M, Howley, Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 79 29 7147 7151, 1982 DiMaio, D., R. Treisman, and T. Maniatis, Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 79 13 4030 4034. 1982 andKushner, P.J., B.B. Levinson, and H.M. Goodman, J Mol. Appln. Genet., 1 6 527 528, 1982 . Such vectors are efficient in directing the regulated expression from inducible promoters and in expressing gene products destined for intra and extracellular location. Vectors which may be employed as starting materials useful for the construction of the vectors of the subject invention are described in U.S. Patent 4,419,446, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. Another improvement in the BPV vector system was the incorporation of a dominant selectabie marker which has expanded the range of cells capable of supporting amplified BPV plasmid replication beyond those manifestirrg the transformed phenotype. This invention realizes the utility of BPVDNA to imortalize cells and to exist as multicopy plasmid in transduced cells. It further describes adaptation of these transduced cells for prolonged amplified expression of a foreign gene using human gamma IFN cDNA as the model gene. The present invention relates to a bovine papillomavirus expression vector capable of replication in a prokaryotic host and replication and expression of, non native genetic information in an eukaryotic host comprising a prokaryotic promoter, a eukaryotic promoter., at least two dominant selectable markers, a signal sequence, and an enhancer element. The present invention has made it possible to provide readily available large quantities of human immune interferon. This has been achieved by the application of recombinant DNA technology to preparing cloning vehicles encoding for the human immune interferon protein, and by screening isolating procedures for recovering human immune interferon essentially free of other proteins of human origin. Accordingly, the present invention provides human immune interferon or its fragments essentially free of other proteins of human origin. Characteristically, the immune interferon protein is glycosylated. Immune interferon is produced by recombinantDNA techniques in host cells or other self replicating systems and is provided in essentially pure form. Also provided are methods and compositions for preparing the above described interferon as well as therapeutic compositions and uses for the interferon protein or fragments in the treatment of cancer or viral infections in humans and animals. The invention further provides replicable expression vectors incorporating a DNA sequence encoding immune interferon and a self replicating host cell system transformed or transfected thereby. The host system is mammalian cells. The human immune interferon is produced by a process which comprises a preparing a replicable expression vector capable of expressing the DNA sequence encoding interferon in a suitable host cell system b tr ansforming said host system to obtain a recombinant host system c maintaining said recombinant host system under conditions permitting expression of said interferon encodingDNA sequence to produce immune interferon protein and d recovering said interferon protein.Preferably, the interferon encoding replicable expression vector is made by preparing a doublestranded complementary DNA ds cDNA preparation representative of interferon mRNA and incorporating the ds cDNA into replicable expression vectors within a eukaryotic transcription cassette containing regulatory elements required for transcription of said cDNA. The preferred mode of recovering the interferon comprises reacting the proteins expressed by the recombinant host system with a reagent composition comprising at least one binding protein specific for interferon. Binding proteins such as antibodies to IFN y, either monoclonal or polyclonal, would be useful in the recovery step. See for example the antibody described by Lee J., et al. Immunol. Methods 69 1 61 70 1984 . According to one embodiment, the invention provides a bovine papillomavirus expression vector capable of dual host replication by virtue of the presence of a prokaryotic replicon and a eukaryotic replicon. The vector also contains a eukaryotic promoter, a prokaryotic promoter, at least two dominant selectable markers. and a signal se quence. According to a further embodiment, this invention provides various derivatives of BPV expression vectors characterized in possessing increased expression capabilities when compared to a standard vector. According to another embodiment, the invention provides a host transformed by a bovine papillomavirus expression vector capable of replication in a prokaryotic replicon, a eukaryotic replicon, a eukaryotic promoter, at least two dominant selectable markers, and a signal sequence. According to a final embodiment, the invention provides a process for producing human interferon comprising providing a replicable expression vector capable of expressing the DNA sequence encoding immune interferon in a suitable host, transforming said host, and maintaining said transformed host under conditions permitting the expression of said interferon, the improvement which comprises the employing the vector pdBV y IFN as the replicable expression vector.

Different alleles of interferon may exist in nature. These variations may be characterized by difference s in the nucleotide sequence of the structural gene coding for proteins of identical biological function. In addition, the location and degree of giycosylation as well as other post translation modifications may vary and will depend to a degree upon the nature of the host and environment in which the protein is produced. It is possible to produce analogs having single or multiple amino acid substitutions, deletions, additions, or replacements. All such allelic variations, modifications, and analogs resulting in derivatives of interferon which retain the biologically active propbrties of native interferon are included within the scope of this invention. Expression vectors refer to vectors which are capable of transcribing and translating DNA sequences contained therein, where such sequences are linked to other regulatory sequences capable of effecting their expression. These expression vectors must be repiicable in the host organisms or systems either as episomes, bacteriophage, or as an integral part of the chromosomal DNA. One form of expression vector which is particularly suitable for use in the invention is bovine papillomavirus PBV DNA. The phrase shuttle vector means the vector contains the necessary replication regions replicons to allow replication in two distinct hosts.The shuttle vectors of this invention are capable of replication in E. coli, a prokaryotic organism due to the presence of a bacterial replicon contained in the plasmid PML2D1, itself a derivative of plasmid pBR322 as well as capable of replication in an PBV susceptible eukaryotic cell line due to the BPV replicon. The molecularly cloned bovine papillomavirus 1 DNA as well as a cloned 69 subgenomic fragment of the bovine papillomavirus 1 genome are very efficient in inducing transformed foci in susceptible mouse cell Howley, P.M., et al. 1980, inM. Essex, et al., ed. , Viruses in Naturallv Occurring Cancers, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory ColdSpring Harbor, New York p. 233 247 and Lowry,D.R., et al., Nature London 1980 287 72 . Bovine papillomavirus transformed cells contain multiple copies 10 to 120 per cell of the viral DNA. These copies exist exclusively as unintegrated extrachromosomal molecules Law, et al., suDra, thus, offering a natural means of amplifying foreign DNA sequences which are covalently linked to the bovine papiilomavirus transforming segment.Since integration of the viral genome does not occur, Law et al., supra , the physical contiguity of the passenger DNA segment should be preserved.The transformed phenotype provides a marker for selecting those cells that have incorporated the foreign DNA segment thus, any cell line susceptible to bovine papillomavirus transformation is a potential recipient. Bovine papillomavirus transformed cells grow faster than their nontransformed counterparts. This should facilitate the large scale production of cells containing the exogenous gene and possibly, therefore, the gene product. Recombinant vectors and methodology disclosed herein are suitable for use in host cells covering a wide range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. In general, of course, prokayotes are preferred for the cloning and amplifica tion of DNA sequences and in the construction of vectors. For example, E. coli K12 strain HB101 ATCC No. 33694 , is particularly useful. Of course, other microbial strains may be used. Vectors containing replication and control sequences which are derived from species compatible with the host cell or system are used in connection with these hosts.The vector ordinarily carries an origin of replication, as well as genetic characteristics capable of providing phenotypic selection in transformed cells. For example, E. coli can be transformed using the vector pBR322, which contains the promoters and genes for ampicillin and tetracycline resistance Bolivar, et al., Gene, 2 94 1977 . These antibiotic resistance genes provide a means of identifying transformed cells. The expression vector may also contain control elements which can be used by the vector for expression of its own proteins. Common prokaryotic control elements used for expression of foreign DNA sequences in E coii include the promoters and regulatory sequences derived from the 8 galactosidase and tryptophan trp operons of E coli, as well as the pR and pL promoters of bacteriophage lambda.Combinations of these elements have also been used e.g., TAC, which is a fusion of the trp promoter with the lactose operator . Other promoters have also been discovered and utilized, and details concerning their nucleotide sequences have been published enabling a skilled worker to combine and exploit them functionally. In addition to microorganisms, cultures of cells derived from multicellular organisms may also be used as hosts. In principle, any such cell culture is workable, whether from a vertebrate or invertebrate source. However, interest has been greatest in vertebrate cells, and propagation of vertebrate cells in culture tissue culture has become a routine procedure in recent years. Examples of such useful hosts are the mouse L cells, VERO, HeLa, mouse C127, Chinese hamster ovary CHO , W138, BHK,COS 7, and MDBK cell lines. Expression vectors for such cells ordinarily include an origin of replication, a promoter located upstream of the gene to be expressed, along with any RNA splice sites, polyadenylation site, and transcription termination sequence. For use in mammalian cells, the control functions on the expression vectors are often provided by viral derived sequences. For example, commonly used promoters are derived from polyoma,Adenovirus 2, and most frequently, Simian Virus 40 SV40 . Further, it is also possible and often desirable, to utilize promoter or control sequences naturally associated with the desired gene sequence, provided such control sequences are compatible with the host system. To increase the rate to transcription, eukaryotic enhancer sequences can also be added to the construction. These sequences can be obtained from a variety of DNA viruses such as SV40, polyoma or oncogenic retroviruses such as the mouse sarcoma virus and mammary tumor virus. A mammalian origin of replication is usually part of the viral vector used as a vehicle, such as that provided by SV40 or other viral sources, or may be provided by the host cell chromosomal replication mechanism. If the vector is integrated into the host cell chromosome, the latter is often sufficient. Host cells can prepare interferon proteins which can be a variety of chemical compositions.The protein is produced having methionine as its first amino acid present by virtue of the ATG start signal codon naturally existing at the beginning of the structural gene or inserted before a segment of the structural gene . The protein may also be intraor extracellularly cleaved, giving rise to the amino acid which is found naturally at the amino terminus of the protein. The protein may be produced together with either its signal poiypeptide or a conjugated protein other than the convention signal polypeptide, the signal polypeptide of the conjugate being specifically cleavable in an intra or extracellular environment. Finally, interferon may be produced by direct expression in mature form without the necessity of cleaving away any extraneous polypeptide. The signal sequence used herein is the y lFN signal sequence described by Devos, et al. Nucleic Acid Res. 10 2487 1501 1982 and Gray, et al. Nature 295 503 508 1982 which includes the coding region for an additional three amino acids lys, tyr, cys 3 to the region reported. This modified sequence is a unique signal sequence construction and is useful for the expression and export of a variety of other protein products in addition to iFN z for which open reading found sequences are available. Recombinant host cells refer to cells which have been transformed with vectors constructed using recombinant DNA techniques. As defined herein, immune interferon is produced as a consequence of this transformation. Immune interferon or its fragments produced by such cells are re ferred.to as recombinant immune interferon . Plecombinant and Screening Methodology The procedures below are but some of a wide variety of well established procedures to produce specific reagents useful in the process of this in invention. Double stranded cDNA ds cDNA is in serted into the expression vector by any one of many known techniques. In general, methods, etc., can be found in Maniatis, suDra, and Methods InEnzvmoloov, Volumes 65 and 68 1980 and Volume 100 and 101 1983 . In general, the vector is linearized by at least one restriction endonuclease, which will produce at least two blunt or cohesive ends. The ds cDNA is ligated with or joined to the vector insertion site. If prokayotic cells or other cells which contain substantial cell wall material are employed, the most common method of transformation with the expression vector is calcium chloride pretreatment as described by Cohen, R.N., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 69 2110 1972 . If cells without cell wall barriers are used as host cells, transfection is carried out by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method described by Graham and Van der Eb, Viroloov, 52 456 1973 . Other methods for introducing DNA into cells such as nuclear injection or protoplast fusion, have also been successfully used. The organisms are then cultured on selective media and proteins for which the expression vector encodes are produced. Clones containing the entire gene for immune interferon are identified in a semi micro C.P.E. inhibition assay using WISH cells as the indicator cells and EMC as the challenge virus. This method of identification requires that the ds cDNA be inserted into a vector containing appropriate regulatory nucleic acid sequences adjacent to the insertion site. These regulatory sequences initiate transcription and transiation of those ds cDNA molecules inserted in the vector. Those clones containing interferon cDNA sequences correctly positioned relative to the regulatory sequences synthesize part or all of the interferon protein. Restriction endonuclease digestion and nucleotide sequencing techniques are used to determine the sequence of amino acids encoded by the cDNA fragments. The invention may be more fully appreciated by reference to the following Examples which in no event should be construed to limit the invention.EXAMPLE 1Isolation of the Recombinant Clone The gamma interferon cDNA clone employed herein was obtained as follows. Briefly, size fractionated mRNA was isolated from human peripheral blood lymphocytes that had been induced with A231 87 and mezzarine I.A. Braude, Biochemistrv, 23 5603, 1984 . The mRNA was converted into double stranded cDNA and cloned into the Pstl site of pBR322 by G C tailing using standard procedures. An 843 base pair Sau3A fragment containing the gamma interferon signal peptide, coding region, and translation termination codon, was cloned into a BPV derivative vector as shown in Figure 1. The resulting construct contained gamma interferon sequences placed downstream from a mouse metallothienein 1 promoter, MSV enhancer sequence, and also contained the SV40 small t splice sites and polyadenylation site. The vector also contains 314 b.p. between the 3 end of the IFN cDNA and the SV40 elements. The 314 b.p. are derived from the 3 ends of the neomycin gene See Figure 4B . C127 mouse cells were transformed using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method Graham and van der Eb, suDra followed by enhancement with 25 dimethylsulfoxide Stowe and Wilkie, J.Gen. Virol., 33 447, 1976 as described previously Sarver, et al., Mol. Cell Biol., 1 1 486, 1981 . Phenotypically transformed foci were isolated and established as cell lines. Single cell cloning was achieved by plating at limited dilution into 96 well plates Co star , incubating at 37 C., identifying wells containing a single cell, and propagating these cells into established lines. As an initial characterization of the foci, tissue culture media from transformed cells derived from 16 individual foci was collected and assayed for the presence of biologically active gamma interferon.The biological assay specifically measured a reduction in the cytopathic effect of EMC on humanWISH cells. The results in Figure 2A demonstrate a large variation in the amount of biologically active gamma interferon produced by different foci. However, when the analysis was performed on 24 independent single cell clones obtained from a single transformed focus number 8 4 G , the amount of biologically active gamma interferon produced differed over a much smaller range Figure 2B . Having identified gamma interferon biological activity BPV transformed cells, the nature of the polypeptide product was investigated. Cells were labelled with 35S methionine, extracellular media was harvested and immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal goat anti gamma interferon serum. The precipitated proteins were then analyzed on SDS polyacrylamide gels as described elsewhere Sarver, et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 1 486 496 1981 .Analysis of BPV transformed cells demonstrated the presence of a prominent band identical in its electrophoretic mobility to native gamma interferon Figure 7 . This band was absent from the media obtained from cells transformed by BPV constructs containing gamma interferon cDNA inserted in the opposite orientation. In a competitive binding study, samples were incubated with antiserum previously neutralized with 2 rig of gamma interferon. Under these conditions, a significant reduction of the amount of gamma interferon like protein that was immunoprecipitated. The production of crude gamma interferon was subsequently examined as a function of the serum concentration in the medium. Duplicate cultures of transformed cells were grown in the presence or absence of fetal calf serum. The culture media was harvested daily and assayed for the presence of biologically active gamma interferon. The data inFigure 3 demonstrated that approximately 10 fold more gamma interferon is produced in cells maintained in the presence of 2.5 fetal calf serum when compared with cells maintained in the absence of serum.Purification of Recombinant Human Gamma Interferon In order to obtain sufficient material for biochemical characterization, approximately 50 liters of crude tissue culture medium was collected and used for large scale protein purification. The purification procedure used was essentially that described by Braude suora for the purification of natural gamma interferon.The protocol consists of essentially 5 steps that are summarized in Table 1.

This resulted in an 85 recovery of the gamma interferon activity present in the starting material. Approximately one third of the G 100 material was then further processed on CM Biogel.Peak points of the Biol Gel column had a specific activity of 1.2 x 10 IU per mg. The specific activity of gamma interferon has been reported to be between 1.0 and 2 x 10E lU mg, consequently, the recombinant material purified by the protocol approaches that of the pure human gamma interferon. The recombinant protein is biologically indistinguishable from nature IFN in that it confers antiviral protection on appropriate host cells, induces the expression of class ll major histocompatibility MHC antigens in HeLa and endothelial cells and is neutralized by anti human z lFN serum. Its identity with authentic human y lFN is further illustrated by the fact that a monoclonal antibody provided by Rebesh Rubin, New York Blood Center which recognized nature y lFN isolated from included peripheral blood leukocytes, but not bacterially produced recombinant human y lFN, complete neutralizes the y lFN obtained from the engineeredC127 cells. Greater than 80 of the recombinant protein is found extracellularly, indicating efficient transport across the cell membrane. The reported amino acid sequence of y lFN accounts for a peptide of 17,000 daltons. The apparent size of 22,000 25,000 daltons of crude Figure 4 purified y iFN, coupled with the observation that it binds to the ConA sepharose column, strongly suggests that it contains carbohydrate moieties. Thus, post trans rational modifications of the rlFN protein, including removal of the signal peptide and glycosylation of the protein appear to be faithfully carried out in transformed C127 cells.EXAMPLE II in an attempt to increase the level of expression the DNA region adjacent to the 3 encoding end of the rlFN genetic region was subjected to various modifications. With refemce to Figures 1 and 4, the detail of the region is indicated by the enlarged insert. The region of modification comprises an inactive fragment of the neomycin resistance gene, a region of SV40 DNA containing 1 small t splice sites which have been implicated in the post transcriptional modification of mRNAs, as well as 2 a polyadenylation site. As used herein the phrase posttranscriptionai regulatory includes sequences involved with mRNA processing events such as the small t splice regions and poly A addition sequences described above. Two of these elements 3 to the gamma interferon gene theoretically are dispensible for gene expression A 314 bp fragment representing only the 3 portion of the neomycin gene which does not impart resistance to neomycin on the host cell and a donor acceptor site derived from the SV40 small t intron. Since the gamma interferon insert is already a processed cDNA, splicing should not be required for gene expression. Figure 4 depicts the structural features of these elements. In order to minimize the overall size of the DNA vector, additional vectors were constructed which differed only in the region 3 to gamma interferon cDNA Figure 5 , and assessed their potential for directing high levei gene expression.These results, which are summarized in Table 2, demonstrate the following. Sequences derived from the neomycin gene interfere with gamma interferon expression when placed between the 3 terminus of the insert and the RNA processing signals. Thus, p8 4, containing the 3 portion of the neomycin gene at this position, induces only 10 20 the level of gamma interferon as does p72 4 from which the neomycin sequences had been removed. This interference with gene expression is even more dramatic when the entire neoymcin gene 5 and 3 portions is placed downstream of the gamma interferon cDNA. In this case, no gamma interferon biological activity was detected in most of the lines tested p50 2, Table 2 . Surprisingly, cells containing p50 2 DNA are resistant to G41 8, indicating that the neomycin gene is fully functional. The presence of a SV40 small t intron has an augmenting effect on gamma interferon cDNA expression. Thus, p70 21, deleted of SV40 splicing signals is only 50 as efficient is splicing gamma interferon as p84, the original vector. This result was cdmpleteiy unexpected since the a lFN is a cDNA insert, the necessity of region encoding splicing elements should not be required. The reason for the enhancing ability of this region is unknown. Several cell lines harboring the modified p72 4 depicted in Figure 6 were established, some capable of secreting as much as ten fold high levels of gamma interferon that previous lines. Extensive biochemical characterization of one such line NS72 4 9 6 has demonstrated that the plasmidDNA is maintained as an episome at high copy number, the gamma interferon specific RNA is of the correct size and that the secreted protein is a glycosylated monomer 22,000 26,000 d in size.Greater than 95 of the foreign protein was secreted outside the cell proper. The cell lines have been in culture for at least four months and are stable with regard to the level of human gamma interferon expression.
