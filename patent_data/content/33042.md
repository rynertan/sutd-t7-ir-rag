# Ophthalmic inserts for lowering intraocular pressure comprising carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.

## Abstract
Although carbonic anhydrase inhibitors C.A.I. can be administered systemically by oral or intravenous routes, attempts to administer them topically have been ineffective and inactive in the treatment of intraocular hypertension. The alkali metal salts, especially the sodium and potassium salts, of salt forming C.A.I. are now found to be remarkably effective in lowering intraocular pressure, even in normotensive hosts, but especially in those hosts having an elevated intraocular pressure.

## Description
OPHTHALMIC COMPOSITIONS OF CARBONIC ANHYDRASEINHIBITORS FOR TOPICAL APPLICATION IN THE TREATMENTOF ELEVATED INTRAOCULAR PRESSUREDISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to compositions of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors that are topically effective in the treatment of elevated intraocular pressure. More particularly, it relates to compositions comprising the alkali metal salts of saltforming carbonic anhydrase inhibitors that, when applied topically to the eye, are transported to the cilary process. In particular, this invention relates to compositions of the sodium and potassium salts of salt forming carboxy anhydrase inhibitors and their use to lower intraocular pressure, especially in the treatment of ocular hypertension and glaucoma. Glaucoma is a degenerative disease of the eye wherein the pressure in the eye i.e., intraocular pressure is too high for the normal function of the eye and, as a result, damage occurs to the optic nerve head and results in irreversible loss of visual function. If untreated, glaucoma will eventually lead to blindness. Ocular hypertension, i.e., the condition of elevated intraocular pressure without optic nerve head damage or characteristic glaucomatous visual field loss, is now believed by the majority of ophthalmologists to merely represent the earliest phase in the onset of a glaucoma. A number of the drugs presently employed to treat glaucoma are not entirely satisfactory, particularly in the earliest course of the disease when the side effects they produce are often worse than the symptoms of the disease. Pilocarpine, for example, although systemically harmless and quite effective, causes considerable local difficulties. The pupil constricts so that little light becomes available to the eye and the eye loses its ability to adapt from light to dark.Accommodation is stimulated so that the patient s refraction is sometimes incorrect and vision is blurred. The drug itself causes a local vasodilitation and red eyes and irritation are common.In short, although valuable, it really isunsatis factory as a first line drug. When carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are used systemically they have a number of disadvantages.While extremely effective in lowering intraocular pressure, they often cause a numbness and tingling, gastrointestinal upsets and, frequently, depression, lethargy, and a loss of appetite, and general malaise.These, in addition to the occasional more severe systemic complications such as aplastic anemia, are so common that many physicians are reluctant to routinely prescribe carboxy anhydrase inhibitors.As a consequence, only highly motivated patients who understand the seriousness of their condition will faithfully continue medication. While investigators have long realized the benefits that would accompany topical administration, the selection of the proper entity has long eluded them. Reports in the literature indicate that carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are inactive topically Even the extreme measure of direct injection into the anterior chamber is reported to have no pressure lowering effect. In the face of this collection of negative findings, it is now discovered that if an alkali metal salt, most preferably the sodium or potassium salt, of a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor is employed as a topical agent, the pressure lowering effects are substantially equivalent to systemic administration of the parent drug. Because carbonic anhydrase inhibitors have a profound effect in altering basic metabolism, the avoidance of a systemic route serves to diminish, if not entirely eliminate, those side effects caused by metabolic acidosis such as vomiting, numbness, tingling, and general malaise and the like. In the practice of this invention, the alkali metal salts of carbonic anhydrase inhibitor are prepared from the known, salt forming carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, the following of which are preferred EMI4.1 where t is an alkali metal cation As used herein, the term alkali metal includes lithium, sodium, potassium, cesium and rubidium. These salts may be hygroscopic and, as a consequence, may occur as hydrated species.However, when used in aqueous isotonic ophthalmic solutions, hygroscopicity is obviously no longer a problem. When formulating into an insert, the material should be kept as dry as possible during manufacture and protected from excessive moisture during storage and before use. The preferred alkali metal salts include as cations, potassium, sodium, and rubidium, with the most preferred being potassium and sodium. In ophthalmic solutions, the potassium cation is preferred, but in inserts, the potassium and sodium forms are both preferred cations. Other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors can be used if they are capable of forming an alkali metal salt. Especially useful are those carbonic anhydrase inhibitors which have the sulfamoyl moiety i.e., SO2NH2 as a substituent. This can form the salt, SO2 Ht, where t is defined as above.Thus, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as p sulfamoylbenzoic acid N 5 aminosulfonyl l,3,4 thiadiazol 2 ylipropanamide N 5 amino sulfonyl 1,3,4 thiadiazol 2 yl butanamide and 5 benzenesulfonamido 1,3,4 thiadiazol 2 sulfonamide can also be used when formulating the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor alkali metal salts into an ophthalmic preparation, e.g., from 0.1 to 5 by weight can be employed. The objective is to administer a dose of from 0.1 to 10 mg. per eye to the patient. Thus, in a liquid vehicle from 0.1 to 15 is carbonic anhydrase inhibitor salt, the remainder being carrier. The compounds of this invention are preferably administered in the form of ophthalmic pharmaceutical compositions adapted for topical administration to the eye such as solutions, ointments or as solid inserts. Formulations of these compounds may contain from 0.01 to 5 and especially 0.5 to 2 of medicament. Higher dosages as, for example, about 10 , or lower dosages can be employed provided the dose is effective in lowering intraocular pressure. As a unit dosage from between 0.001 to 10.0 mg., preferably .005 to 2.0 mg., and especially 0.1 to 1.0 mg. of the compound is generally applied to the human eye, generally on a daily basis. The pharmaceutical preparation which contains the compound may be conveniently admixed with a nontoxic pharmaceutical organic carrier, or with a pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic carrier.Typical of such pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are, for example, water, mixtures of water and watermiscible solvents such as lower alkanols or vegetable oils, polyalkylene glycols, petroleum based jelly, hydroxyethyl cellulose, ethyl oleate, carboxymethyl cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and other conventionally employed acceptable carriers.The pharmaceutical preparation may also contain non toxic auxiliary substances such as emulsifying, preserving, wetting, bodying agents and the like, as for example, polyethylene glycols 200, 300, 400 and 600, carbowaxes 1,000, 1,500, 4,000, 6,000 and 10,000, antibacterial components such as quaternary ammonium compounds phenylmercuric salts known to have cold sterilizing properties and which are non injurious in use thimerosal, methyl and propyl paraben, benzyl alcohol, phenyl ethanol buffering ingredients such as alkali metal chloride7 borate, acetate, gluconate buffers, and other conventional ingredients such as sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine, oleate, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monopalmitylate, dioctyl alkali metal sulfosuccinate, monothioglycerol, ethylenediamine tetracetic acid and the like. When buffers are used that comprise an alkali metal cation, it is most highly preferred that the alkali metal cation of the buffer is identical to the alkali metal cation of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Additionally, suitable ophthalmic vehicles can be used as carrier media for the present purpose including conventional phosphate buffer vehicle systems, isotonic boric acid vehicles, isotonic alkali chloride vehicles, tris and the like. The pharmaceutical preparation may also be in the form of a solid insert. For example, one may use a solid water soluble polymer as the carrier for the medicament. Inserts that are known in the art that are suitable for use with this include those set forth and described in U.S.P. 3,993,071 U.S.P.3,986,510 U.S.P. 3,868,445 and U.S.P. 3,867,510 employing the formulation and fabrication techniques described therein. The polymer used to form the insert may be any water soluble non toxic polymer, for example, cellulose derivatives such as methyl cellulose, alkali metal carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose acrylates such as polyacrylic acid salts, ethylacrylates polyacrylamides natural products such as gelatin, alginates, pectins, tragacanth, karaya, shondrus, agar, acacia the starch derivatives such as starch acetate, hydroxyethyl starch ethers, hydroxypropyl starch, as well as other synthetic derivatives such as polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyvinyl methyl ether, polyethylene oxide, neutralized carbopol and xanthan gum and mixtures of said polymer. If a solid insert is employed, it preferably is prepared from cellulose derivatives such as methyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose or hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose or from other synthetic materials such as polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyethylene oxide or polyvinyl methyl ether. Hydroxypropyl cellulose, one of the preferred polymers for the preparation of the insert is available in several polymeric forms, all of which are suitable in the preparation of these inserts. Thus, the product sold by Hercules, Inc. of Wilmington, Delaware, under the name KLUCEL such as KLUCEL HF, HWF, MF, GF,JF, LF and EF, which are intended for food or pharmaceutical use, are particularly useful. The molecular weight of these polymers useful for the purposes described herein may be at least 30,000 to about 1,000,000 or more. Similarly, an ethylene oxide polymer having a molecular weight of up to 5,000,000 or greater, and preferably 100,000 to 5,000,000 can be employed. Further, for example, POLYOX, a polymer supplied by Union Carbide Co., may be used having a molecular weight of about 50,000 to 5,000,000 or more and preferably 3,000,000 to 4,000,000. Other specific polymers which are useful are polyvinyl pyrrolidine having a molecular weight of from about 10,000 to about 1,000,000 or more, preferably up to about 350,000 and especially about 20,000 to 60,000, polyvinyl alcohol having a molecular weight of from about 30,000 to 1,000,000 or more, particularly about 400,000 and especially from about 100,000 to about 200,000 hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose having a molecular weight of from about 10,000 to 1,000,000 or more, particularly up to about 200,000 and especially about 80,000 to about 125,000 methyl cellulose having a molecular weight of from about 10,000 to about 1,000,000 or more, preferably up to about 200,000 and especially about 50 to 100,000 and CARBOPOL carboxyvinyl polymer of B.F. Goodrich and Co. designated as grades 934, 940 and 941. For the purpose of this invention the type and molecular weight of the polymer is not critical.Any water soluble polymers can be used which have an average molecular weight which will afford dissolution of the polymer and, accordingly, the medicament in any desired length of time. The inserts, therefore, can be prepared to allow for retention and, accordingly, effectiveness in the eye for any desired period.The insert can be in the form of a square, rectangle, oval, circle, doughnut, semi circle, 1 4 moon shape, and the like. Preferably, the insert is in the form of a rod, doughnut, oval or 1 4 moon. The insert can be readily prepared, for example, by dissolving the medicament and the polymer in a suitable solvent and evaporating the resulting solution to afford a thin film of the polymer which can then be subdivided to prepare inserts of appropriate size. Alternatively, the insert can be prepared by intimately admixing polymer and the medicament and thereafter molding the resulting mixture under the influence of heat and pressure to form a thin film. Preferably, the inserts are prepared by molding or extrusion procedures well known in the art. The molded or extruded product can then be subdivided to afford inserts of suitable size for administration in the eye. The insert can be of any suitable size which readily fits into the eye. For example, castings or compression molded films having a thickness of about 0.25 mm. to 1.50 mm. can be subdivided to obtain suitable inserts. Rectangular segments of the cast or compressed film having a thickness between about 0.5 and 1.5 mm. can be cut to afford shapes such as rectangular plates of 4 x 5 20 mm. or ovals of comparable size. Similarly, extruded rods having a diameter between about 0.5 and 1.5 mm. can be cut into suitable sections to provide the desired amount of polymer. For example, rods of 1.0 to 1.5 mm. in diameter and about 2 20 mm. long are found to be satisfactory. The inserts may also be directly formed by injection molding.It is preferred that the ophthalmic inserts containing the medicament of the present invention be formed so that they are smooth and do not have any sharp edges or corners which could cause damage to the eye. Since the term smooth and sharp edges or corners are subjective terms, in this application these terms are used to indicate that excessive irritation of the eye will not result from the use of the insert. The medicated ocular inserts can also contain plasticizers, buffering agents, appropriate inert fillers, and preservatives. Plasticizers suitable fox this purpose must, of course, also be completely soluble in the lacrimal fluids of the eye. Examples of suitable plasticizers that might be mentioned are water, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerine, trimethylol propane, di and tripropylene glycol, hydroxypropyl sucrose and the like. Typically, such plasticizers can be present in the medicated ophthalmic insert in an amount ranging from up to 1 to about 30 by weight.A particularly preferred plasticizer is water which is present in amounts of at least about 5 up to about 40 . In actual practice, a water content of from about 10 to about 20 is preferred since it may be easily accomplished and adds the desired softness and pliability to the insert. When plasticizing the solid medicinal product with water, the product is contacted with air having a relative humidity of at least 40 until said product picks up at least about 5 water and becomes softer and more pliable. In a preferred embodiment, the relative humidity of the air is from about 60 to about 99 and the contact is continued until the water is present in the product in amounts of from about 10 to about 20 . Suitable water soluble preservatives which may be employed in the insert are alkali bisulfate, alkali thiosulfate, ascorbate, benzalkonium chloride, chlorobutanol, thimerosal, phenylmercuric acetate, phenylmercuric borate, parabens, benzyl alcohol and phenyl ethanol. These agents may be present in amounts of from 0.001 to 5 by weight of solid insert, and preferably 0.1 to 2 . Suitable water soluble buffering agents are alkali, alkali earth carbonates, phosphates, bicarbonates, citrates, borates, and the like, such as sodium or potassium phosphate, citrate, borate, acetate, bicarbonate and carbonate. These agents may be present in amounts sufficient to obtain a pH of the system of between 5.5 to 8.1 and especially 7 8 usually up to about 2 by weight of polymer. The insert may contain from about 1 mg. to 100 mg. of water soluble polymer, more particularly from 5 to 50 mg. and especially from 5 to 20 mg. The medicament is present from about 0.1 to about 25 by weight of insert. The following examples serve to more fully illustrate this invention.EXAMPLE 1Solution Composition Na salt of methazolamide 1 mg. 15 mg.Benzalkonium chloride 0.10 mg. 0.10 mg.Sodium hydroxide q.s. pH 8 10 pH 8 10Water for injection q.s. ad. 1.0 ml. 1.0 ml.phosphate buffer salts, may be added to further adjust the pH to the level desired and benzalkonium chloride are added to and dissolved in water.

Ophthalmic inserts are manufactured from a solvent cast film prepared by making a viscous solution of the powder blend using a methanol water solvent system 10 ml. methanol is added to 2.5 g.of powder blend, to which 11 ml. of water in three divided portions is added . The solution is placed on a Teflon polytetrafluoroethylene plate and allowed to dry at ambient conditions. After drying, the film is placed in an 88 relative humidity cabinet until it is pliable. Appropriately sized inserts are then cut from the film.EXAMPLE 4Na salt of methazolamide 1 mg .Hydroxypropyl cellulose q.s. a.d. 12 mg. Ophthalmic inserts are manufactured from compression molded films which are prepared on aCarver Press by subjecting the powder mixture of the above ingredients to a compressional force of 12,000 lbs. gauge at 3500F for one minute. The film is cooled under pressure by having cold water circulate in the platen. Ophthalmic inserts are then individually cut from the film with a punch. Each insert is placed into a vial, which is then placed in a humidity cabinet 88 relative humidity at 300C for two to four days. After removal from the humidity cabinet, the vials are stoppered and then capped.The vials containing the hydrated insert are then sterilized by means known in the art such as irradiation with high energy electron beams, gamma radiation with a wuitable radiation source such as Co60.

Therefore, the pressure reducing effects are cumulative.EXAMPLE 5Preparation of N 5 aminosulfonyl 3 methyl 1,3,4 thiadiazol 2 3H ylidene acetamide Potassium Salt To a solution of 0.1N potassium hydroxide in methanol 1.19 1., 0.119 mole is added distilled water 300 ml. and N 5 aminosulfonyl 3 methyl 1,3,4 thiadiazol 2 3H ylidene acetamide 28.12 g., 0.119 mole at room temperature.

However, these two salt forms e.g., sodium and potassium , achieve comparable ceiling effects. Therefore, when rapid onset of action is desired it is preferred to employ the sodium salt when inserts are used as the carrier or vehicle. Generally, administration of one to two drops per eye of the liquid formulation from twice a day to once every 8 hours is sufficient to control ocular hypertension. When using inserts to administer the medication one insert per day per eye is suitable.However, as with all medication, medical monitoring of symptoms must be employed to enable one to arrive at the optimum dosage for the patient.
