## Description
IMPROVED POLYURETHANE CATALYST COMPOSITIONS The present invention generally relates to preparation of polyurethanes from hindered aliphatic isocyanates, and particularly to improvements in catalysis of the reaction between hindered aliphatic isocyanates and hydroxyl containing compounds. More specifically, the invention relates to novel synergistic catalyst compositions for the formation of polyurethane by reaction between hydroxyl containing compounds and secondary and or tertiary aliphatic diisocyanates. The term aliphatic isocyanate refers to compounds in which the isocyanate group NCO is attached to a carbon atom not in an aromatic ring, and hindered isocyanates are those in which the carbon atom to which the isocyanate group is attached is provided with at least one other inert substituent, generally a lower C1 Cg alkyl group. The preparation of polyurethanes from aliphatic isocyanates is well known and the advantages derived therefrom are appreciated by those skilled in the art. Primary aliphatic isocyanates, for example,1,6 hexamethylene diisocyanate, react significantly faster with compounds containing amino, carboxyl and hydroxyl groups than secondary or tertiary isocyanates. However, many isocyanates containing secondary and or tertiary isocyanate groups are known and some of them provide highly useful polyurethane products.Unfortunately, they usually are exceedingly slow reacting and require catalysis, especially in reactions with hydroxyl containing compounds. Reaction injection molding, commonly referred to by the acronym RIM, is a relatively recent advance in polyurethane technology. The process requires fast polyurethane reactions, that is, on the order of seconds at temperatures in the range of about 25 400C. Commonly used polyurethane catalysts, such as lead naphthenate and dialkyl tin dicarboxylates, are not adequate to promote the reaction between hindered aliphatic isocyanates and hydroxyl containing compounds under these conditions. It is, therefore, a principal object of the present invention to provide catalyst compositions which increase the rate of reaction between hindered aliphatic secondary and or tertiary isocyanates and hydroxyl containing compounds. It is another object of the invention to provide catalyst compositions for the practical utilization of hindered aliphatic secondary and or tertiary isocyanates in the RIM reaction with hydroxyl containing compounds. It is still another object of the invention to provide catalyst compositions for the RIM reaction between aliphatic tertiary diisocyanates and both primary and secondary polyols. In accordance with the present invention, it has been discovered that certain combinations, or mixtures, of lead naphthenate and dialkyl tin dicarboxylates provide enhanced reaction rates between hindered aliphatic secondary and or tertiary isocyanates and hydroxyl containing compounds. More specifically, certain combinations of lead naphthenate and dialkyl tin dicarboxylates are synergistic and provide rates of reaction several times faster than are obtained with either catalyst component alone. The catalyst compositions of the present invention are effective in accelerating the reaction between hydroxylcontaining compounds and aliphatic isocyanates containing at least one secondary or tertiary isocyanate group. Stallmann, U.S. Patent 2,723,265, describes the preparation of a broad range of hindered isocyanates represented by the formula EMI3.1 wherein R1 and R2 represent lower alkyl C1 Cg groups andX represents a bridging unit. A process for the preparation of compounds containing secondary and tertiary isocyanates is disclosed byHoover, U.S. Patent 3,290,350. In the process disclosed in this patent, isocyanic acid is added to a compound containing at least one reactive vinylidene group, of the formula EMI3.2 wherein R1 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and hydrocarbyl Cl Cl2 groups and R2 is hydrogen, hydrocarbyl C1 C12 or substituted hydrocarbyl, wherein thesubstituents are inert to isocyanic acid and are bonded to a carbon atom at least 2 carbon atoms removed from the ethylenic linkage, or R1 and R2 are conjointly hydrocarbylene of 2 12 carbon atOms.Isocyanates prepared according to this process contain the group EMI3.3 A particularly useful clas s of isocyanates prepared according to the process of the Hoover patent are those derived from compounds having more than one vinylidene group, the product isocyanates being represented by the formula EMI4.1 tb SEP R1 SEP R1 tb OCN C arylene C NCO tb SEP R2 SEP R2 tb wherein R1 is hydrogen or C1 C4 alkyl and R2 is hydrogen orC1 C4 alkyl. A wide range of botb secondary and or tertiary isocyanates and diisocyanates may be prepared in accordance with the aforementioned prior art, the reaction of which with hydroxyl containing compounds may ugefully be catalyzed by the catalyst compositions of the present invention.Such isocyanates and diisocyanates may for example include, but are not limited to, the following compounds a,a dimethyl p xylylene diiso cyanate, a,a,a1 ,a1 tetramethyl m xylyl ene diisocyanate, alpha , alpha , alpha , alpha tetramethyl p xylyl ene diisocyanate, alpha methyl alpha , alpha dimethyl m xylyl ene diisocyanate, bis 4 l isocyanato l methyl ethyl phenyl imethane, a ethyl a methyl p xylylene diisocyanate, 2,6 bis l isocyanato l methyl ethyl naphthalene, 1 ,4 bis l isocyanato 1 methyl ethyl cyclohexane, 1,3 bis 1 isocyanato 1 methyl ethyl cyclohexane, 1,8 diisocyanato p menthane, isophorone diisocyanate, and the like. Many catalysts have been used to accelerate the rate of reaction between isocyanates and hydroxyl containing compounds. Lead naphthenate and dialkyl tin dicarboxylates are two of the more commonly used catalyst materials heretofore employed for such purpose. Neither of these catalysts, however, when used alone at any reasonable concentration, is effective to adequately accelerate the reaction between hindered aliphatic isocyanates and hydroxyl containing compounds at temperatures below about 1000C.In accordance with the present invention, mixtures of lead naphthenate and dialkyl tin dicarboxylates, containing from about 25 to about 75 percent by weight of dialkyl tin dicarboxylate, provide reaction rates several times greater than are obtained by the use of either component alone. A preferred composition contains 50 weight percent of each component. Dialkyl tin dicarboxylates, represented by the structure EMI5.1 wherein R represents an alkyl group containing from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, and R represents an alkyl group containing from 1 to 18 carbon atoms, are well known catalyst compounds per se. The preferred dialkyl tin dicarboxylates are dimethyl tin dilaurate and dibutyl tin dilaurate. The lead naphthenate dialkyl tin dicarboxylate catalyst compositions of the present invention in general may be used effectively at a concentration of about 0.05 to about 5 percent by weight, based on the weight of the isocyanate and the hydroxyl containing reactants, although in some instances higher concentrations may be used to advantage. The catalyst compositions of the present invention are suitably employed with aliphatic secondary and or tertiary diisocyanates which are reacted with primary and or secondary polyols, as commonly used in the art, to produce polyurethane products, e.g., coatings and injection molded products, according to conventional polyurethane technology.Such commonly used polyols include, for example, ethylene glycol, 1,2 propanediol, 1,3 propanediol, 1 ,I4 butanediol, 1 ,6 hexanediol, glycerol, trimethylolpropane, p,p bis hydroxyethoxy benzene, and the like low molecular weight mol. wt. 500 5000 polymers or oligomers, such as hydroxyl terminated polyether polyols, for example, polytetramethylene ether glycol, polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, and propylene glycol ethylene glycol block copolymers and hydroxyl terminated polyester poypls such as, polyethyleneadipate, poly ethylene propylene adi pate, and hydroxyl terminated polyurethane prepolymers prepared therefrom. The present invention is illustrated by the following non limiting examples, wherein all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated.
