# Gas laser with acoustic baffle.

## Abstract
A gas laser having an outer conductive shell and two axially displaced spaced plastic cylinders mounted within the shell. The inner plastic cylinder supports the high voltage components to produce a transverse electrical discharge. The outer plastic cylinder is spaced from the outer shell by rubber feet and forms an acoustic baffle to decrease the noise radiated during operation. High speed fans circulate the laser gas around the annular path between the two cylinders and between the high voltage elec trodes. The inner plastic cylinder is manually removable for repair or other reason and carries with it all of the electrical components within the outer shell. High voltage is fed to the high voltage electrodes by means of a circuit that does not include the outer shell. This arrangement minimizes operating noise, provides maximum safety for operating personnel and minimizes electri cal interference.
