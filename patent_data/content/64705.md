# 5 Aminomethyl 2,3 dihydro 2 oxo 1H imidazole 4 carboxylic acid derivatives.

## Abstract
2,3 Dihydro 2 oxo 1H imidazole 4 carboxylic acid de rivatives having a substituted amino methyl substituent at the 5 position, are useful as cardiotonics, antihypertensives and antithrombotic agents. The compounds are obtained by the reaction of an appropriate amine with a 5 bromomethyl 2,3 dihydro 2 oxo 1H imidazole 4 carboxylic acid ester or amide.
