# Cooling apparatus for dot matrix impact print head.

## Abstract
Cooling apparatus for dot matrix impact print head suit able for application in serial printers, where the print head is mounted on a carriage 7 sliding on guiding bars 4, 5 for reciprocating movement thereon, comprising a liquid filled container 10 with inlet 11 and outlet 12 mounted on the carriage and in termal contact with the printing head, a heat dissipator mounted in the printer and having a liquid filled cavity with inlet and outlet, flexible conduits connected to said inlets and outlets so as to form a liquid circulation loop and a unidirectional fluid valve 28 in said loop so that liquid circu lation is induced in said loop by the reciprocating movement of the liquid container. In the preferred form of embodiment the liquid container is formed integral with the print head, the liquid in the con tainer being in direct contact with electromagnetic cores of the print head, and the heat dissipator is formed by a guiding bar, the bar being hollow and having inlet and outlet.
