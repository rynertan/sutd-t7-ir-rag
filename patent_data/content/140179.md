## Description
Lubricating ProcessThe invention resides in a process for lubricating iron and normal or non inoxidable steel screws and screwnuts for fixing any kind of material, especially made of ferrous metals.Atmospheric and weather influences especially in the form of atmospheric moisture, combined with oxygen and materials of pollution are the main factors of corrosion of ferrous surfaces, e. g. of screws and screw nuts.This corrosion, especially oxidation and rust formation on the surfaces, can cause the so called binding of the threads and nuts, which makes it very difficult and often impossible to remove the screws without destruction or severe damage of the parts which are fixed together. This problem can be solved by the use of stainless steel screws and screw nuts but materials, which are completely resistant against corrosion are not easy to obtain and are very expensive.The purpose of the present invention is therefore to provide a process for lubricating and protecting iron and normal or non inoxidable steel screws and screwnuts against corrosion, which can overcome the disadvantages of the prior art. This purpose is solved by the present invention.Subject of the present invention is a process for lubricating iron and normal or non inoxidable steel screws and screw nuts for fixing any kind of material, especially structures made of ferrous metals, characterized in that together with lubrication passivation and consequent protection against direct contact with the ambient atmosphere and inherent oxidation and corrosion of the thread s or screw s surface and simultanteously conversion of rust, if already present, is promoted and or attained by conversion of the rust into an irreversible complex compound that will be integrated in the ferrous surface.In the process particularly a lubricating formulation is used which comprises a semi aqueous emulsifying composition containing at least 5 per cent by weight, based on the total formulation, of a tannin complex compound.The semi aqueous emulsifying composition is particularly obtained by emulsifying the tannin complex compound in an oily or oily type basis by means of a phosphated emulsifier. The emulsion can also contain non phosphated auxiliary emulsifiers. Such a semi aqueous emulsion is perfectly stable in the original non metallic packages used for storage during at least one year.Subject of the present invention is also a lubricating formulation comprising a semi aqueous emulsifying composition containing at least 5 per cent by weight, based on the total formulation, of a tannin complex compound, and the use of such a lubrication formulation for simultaneous lubrication, passivation, protection against corrosion and rust conversion of ferrous surfacessespecially of screws and screw nuts.Amongst the materials to be fixed according to the present invention are machines and industri al equipment of any kind, bridges, port sites, wharves installations and equipment, ships and boats, vehicles of any type, agricultural machines, hydsulic engineering and waterworks.The invention is described in more detail by the following particularities The lubrication is effected by means of lubricating substances as components of the lubricating formulation, which are preferably synthetic or semi synthetic, resistant to oxidation, impermeable and water repellent and non saponifiable. They need not but can contain special additives, i. e. lubricating additives as commonly used.For attaining the passivating, anti corrosive and rustconverting properties a semi aqueous emulsifying composition is incorporated into the lubricating formulation, which contains a condensed tannin complex, which must correspond, at least, to five per cent by weight of the total formulation. This complex inhibits the corrosion of the ferrous surfaces and attains the conversion of rust mainly in the form of Fe hexaquo into a chelate complex, i. e. a bis chelate, with the following assumed formula cf. A. J. Seavell, Journal of Oil andColor Chemists Association, No. 61, 1978 EMI4.1 This structure comprises the iron tannate formed between the Fe3 hexaquo ion of the iron oxide and a condensed tannin complex.In compliance with the same theory it is also possible to assume a redox reaction between Fe hexaquo ions and acid solutions of a condensed tannin Fe3 R OH Fe2 ROH oxidized radical R a flavanoid unit, i. e. a structure providing anOH group in ortho position .According to A. J. Seavell Journal of Oil and Colour 2 Association, No. 61, 1978 a mono complex could also undergo a redox process but once formed there is, however, little likelyhood of Fe III bis chelate complex gaining an electron, because it already carries a negative charge, i. e. stabilizes the higher valency state with respect to the lower Fe III T2 e Fe II T2 2 T chelated tannin The emulsion containing the tannin complex is obtained by starting from a semi aqueous solution emulsifying composition of the said substance, with the participation of a phosphated emulsifying agent, which also reinforces the passivating action on the ferrous surfaces.Different emulsifiers, e. g. non phosphated emulsifiers, can be. used as auxiliary agents.According to the invention on the ferrous surfaces a greasy layer can be formed when the water and watermiscible components of the composition necessary for the complex reaction are separated and are slowly evaporated due to the so called breaking of the emulsion.This layer, which is hydrophobic, impermeable and permanently non drying, involves and fixes the irreversible iron tannin chelate and, due to its greasy and insaponifiable properties, offers a permanent protection to the screws and screw nuts, thus avoiding the disadvantages and troubles caused by the binding of the threads and nuts due to oxidation and rust formation.According to the invention therefore a highly useful lubricating process and formulation is provided, which can also be used for the placing of large gauge screws, both internally and externally, and wherein the formulation has impermeable, isolating and stable properties inherent to the highest grade lubricating substances used and to their oily or greasy character, which allows a great coefficient of surface isolation mainly in the case of threaded surfaces against atmospheric agents and weather influence, even in the form of atmospheric moisture, which, combined with oxygen and materials of pollution, are the main factors of corrosion. Screws and screw nuts protected according to the present invention can also advantageously and efficiently be used to fix wood en parts, remaining a very long time protected against oxidation and corrosion, even if the wood is green or insufficiently dried. According to the invention simultaneously to the lubricating, impermeabilizing and isolating effects a surface passivation, anti corrosive properties and irreversible rust conversion is attained. The process and formulation according to the present invention is therefore of major technical and economical interest for a great number of applications in several fields, from building, both civil and military, to ship building and repair industries , machinery, bridges, water works and all kinds of vehicles.
