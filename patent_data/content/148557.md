# Deep fat fryer.

## Abstract
A deep fat fryer has a filtration system to continuously filter liquid cooking fat circulated by a pump not shown . A filter 40 with a filter element of material such as carbon impregnated cloth is located in the bottom of a frying tank and is rotatable about a swivel joint between a horizontal operating position shown in full lines and a vertical servicing position shown in broken lines. In the vertical position the upper end of the filter is above the surface of the fat in the frying tank and the filter element may readily be replaced without draining the tank and without risk of leakage of fat by removing a locknut 146 and sliding the filter 40 off a pipe 132 through which the fat is supplied to the filter 40 and thence to the tank.
