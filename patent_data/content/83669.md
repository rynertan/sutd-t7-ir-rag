# Strut for Mcpherson type automobile suspensions.

## Abstract
A strut for McPherson type automobile suspensions wherein, in order to minimize the maximum bending stress occurring in the tubular member 10 forming the cylinder of the liner type shock absorber, the knuckle bracket 12 fitted to the lower end of the tubular member 10 is formed by the first 14 bracket with a U shaped cross section and the second bracket 16 with a shaped cross section fitted in the opening part of the said first bracket 14 and a ribbed part 30 is formed beforehand by extending upward the upper end part of the said second bracket 16 so that, by contacting the said ribbed part 30 to the outer walls of the said tubular member 10 those parts which receive the maximum bending stress may be reinforced.

## Description
Strut for McPherson type automobile suspensionsThe present invention relates to a tubular member forming the cylinder of liner type shock absorbers and a knuckle bracket constructed from sheet metal and relates to a strut for McPherson type automobile suspensions, wherein the said knuckle bracket parts for fitting the bearing bush, i.e., the bearing spindle of the wheel brake and the said tubular member are fitted at the lower end in the through hole of the said knuckle bracket and fixed forced push fitting, welding or other means.Constructions of such a type are well known, for instance, from US Patent No. 3,941,401. The knuckle bracket of the strut described in this specification is formed from sheet metal and therefore it is better in that it offers low in manufacturing costs and light weight compared with the common knuckle brackets which are formed from forged steel or cast iron. In addition, it is general knowledge that a cylindrical axle bracket is already being used in practice which has a bracket part for fitting the knuckle spindle at one side of a strut formed by the first bracket with aU shaped cross section covering three fourths of the outer circumference of a tubular member in a strut and the second bracket with a Vi shaped cross section fitted in the opening part of the first bracket.However, where these well known struts for McPherson type suspensions are used in practice, the maximum bending stress is applied to that part of the tubular member which is fitted in the upper end of the knuckle bracket. Since the bending force occuring between the tubular member and the knuckle bracket causes the corresponding part of the tubular member to deform elastically with repeated vibration occuring, cracks or fractures may develop in the tubular member due to bending fatigue and there is a danger of automobile suspensions breaking, thus causing serious danger.These defects may be lessened by increasing the thickness of the particular part of the conventional above mentioned tubular members or by welding a reinforcing sleeve fitted to the particular part of the tubular members as disclosed in the Specification of US Patent No. 3,430,977 however, such means will nullify the low cost and weight advantages to be obtained with the use of a knuckle bracket formed from sheet metal.Therefore, the purpose of the present invention is to use a knuckle bracket made of sheet metal which has low manufacturing costs and a light weight and acts as a strut for McPherson type suspensions which, with use of quite simple means, may reduce the maximum bending stress occurring in the tubular member at the part fitted in the upper end of the knuckle bracket.Thus, with the bending load being applied to the tubular member in the same direction relative to the knuckle bracket, the result is not only a knuckle bracket consisting of the first bracket with a U shaped and a second bracket with a 2 shaped cross section in the opening part of the first bracket, but also a back wall on the upper end of the second bracket extending upward from this part and a pair of walls facing each other and extending forward at right angles from both side edges of the said back wall. Thus, where the knuckle bracket is fitted to the tubular member, the ribbed part of the second bracket of the said knuckle bracket is placed along the outer circumference of the tubular member so that the part extending as a rib of the knuckle bracket may serve to reinforce that part of the tubular member which receives the maximum bending stress in the strut.In this way, the maximum, bending stress applied to the tubular member is reduced to a low level, so that destruction of the tubular member may be prevented and its service life may lengthened considerably. Furthermore, even though the knuckle bracket may be formed by extending a rib, its original function is not at all affected nor does this arrangement lead to major increases in cost.Also, where front edges of the face to face walls which form the said rib part are formed as tapered parts inclined backward, the bending stress occurring in the tubular member may be rendered uniform by this ribbed part.Furthermore, when holes are formed in these face to face walls in the ribbed part to allow a brake hose to pass through, it is possible to avoid difficulties associated with the fitting of any separate brackets for supporting the brake hose.The following describes the potential applications of the present invention with reference to the drawings attached.Fig. 1 represents a side view of a strut according to the present invention. Fig. 2 represents a plan view of the same. Fig. 3 represents a diagonal view of its essential structure part. Fig. 4 represents a side view of the first bracket forming a knuckle bracket. Fig. 5 represents a plan view of the same. Fig. 6 represents a side view of the second bracket forming the same knuckle bracket Fig. 7 represents a plan view of the same.Figs. 1, 2 and 3 show a tubular member 10 , which forms the cylinder of a liner type shock absorber and is located in a strut for McPherson type automobile suspensions.It is already common knowledge that this tubular member 10 is provided with a knuckle bracket 12 , at the lower end, which has a pair of flange parts 12a 12b for fitting a bearing bush, i.e., bearing spindle of an automobile wheel brake.The said knuckle bracket 12 consists of the first bracket 14 and the second bracket 16 , both of which are formed from sheet metal for the purpose of reducing product weight and costs.As can be seen from Figs. 4 and 5, the first bracket 14 is formed by bending sheet metal so as to produce aU shaped cross section and is provided at both the upper and lower ends with reinforcing edges 18 20 extending horizontally and with a pair of bracket parts 14a 14b extending forward, in which bracket parts 14a 14b fitting holes 22 are formed for fitting the said bearing spindle.Moreover, as indicated in Figs. 6 and 7, the second bracket 16 is formed by bending sheet metal so as to produce a W shaped cross section, and fitting holes 24 are bored in the pair of bracket parts 16a 16b extending forward and mating with the fitting holes 22 of the said first bracket 14 .As can be seen from Fig. 2, the above second bracket 16 is inserted into the first bracket 14 throngh the opening part 26 Refer to Fig. 5 and fitted so as to ensure the respective pairs of bracket parts 14a and 16a , 14b and 16b mate with the fitting holes 22 and 24 . If necessary, they are combined to form an integral body by welding or other means. The knuckle bracket 12 thus constructed by the first bracket 14 and the second bracket 16 has a nearly tubular through hole 28 at the center, into which hole 28 the said tubular member 10 is inserted at the lower end and force push fitted, welded or joined by other means.In the above mentioned case, as can particularly be seen from Fig. 3 the second bracket 16 forming the knuckle bracket 12 extends beyond the upper end of the first bracket 14 and forms a ribbed part 30 , which part 30 is an essential element of the present invention.The said ribbed part 30 consists of a back wall 32 extending upward from the body of the second bracket 16 and extensions of the pair of bracket parts 16a 16b , i.e., a pair of face to face walls 32a 32b extending forward at right angles from the front side edges of the said back wall 32 , and the back wall 32 of this ribbed part 30 contacts and supports the outer surfaces of the said tubular member 10 to reinforce that part in the tubular member 10 which receives the maximum bending stress.Particularly, when the front edges of the pair of face to face walls 32a . 32b in the ribbed part 30 are formed as tapered parts 34 inclined backward, as shown in this practical example, the bending stress of the part reinforced by the ribbed part 30 in the tubular member 10 may be rendered uniform as indicated by the bending stress diagram marked by the double dot dash line inFig. 1. Also, when these face to face walls 32a 32b are provided with holes 36 to allow a brake hose to pass through, it is possible to suppress the fitting of any separate bracket.
