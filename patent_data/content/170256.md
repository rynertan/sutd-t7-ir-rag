# System for detecting abnormalities in gas engines.

## Abstract
A system for detecting abnormalities in a gas engine comprises a pressure measuring device 3 for measuring the pressure within each engine cylinder 1 to generate corresponding signals a device 5 for determining from these signals the maximum pressure for every cycle of the engine operation a comparator circuit 15 for comparing each maximum pressure with reference values of a specific range and, when the maximum pressure is outside of that range, generating a corresponding signal indicating the existence of an abnormality and an actuator 16a operating in response to this signal to actuate and close a shut off valve 16 in the fuel gas supply line 18 of the engine, an alarm device 17 being simultaneously activated by this signal.
