# METHOD FOR WRITING CLOCK TRACK FOR USE WITH AN EMBEDDED SERVO TRACK FOLLOWING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A method for writing a clock track on a magnetic storage medium of a disc system comprising a fixed read write head, at least one moving read write head, and means for translating the magnetic storage medium relative to the fixed and the moving heads, whereby information may be written on the medium in the form of magnetic transitions and the magnetic transitions may be read with the fixed and the moving heads, includes the steps of writing a single pair of transitions with the fixed heads, selecting a predetermined number N of transition pairs for a clock track, reading the single pair of transitions to create a single initial electrical pulse, phase lock looping the initial electrical pulse to a number of electrical pulse to a number of electrical pulses approximately equal to the square root of N, writing an intermedi ate clock track with the moving head, the intermediate clock track having a number of transition pairs equal to the square root of N, reading the intermediate clock track to create a number of intermediate clock electrical pulses equal to the square root of N, phase lock looping the intermediate clock electrical pulses to a number of electrical pulses equal to N and writing a clock track with the fixed head having N transition pairs.
