# Process for the preparation of cyclic hexapeptide.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a process for preparing a cyclic hexapeptide somatostatin analog, specifically cyclo D Trp Lys Val Phe N Me Ala Tyr . The cyclic hexapeptide is synthe sized in large quantities in a solution synthesis procedure. However, because of the unexpectedly rapid cyclization rate of this compound, conditions have been developed such that a much more concentrated solution, and thus smaller volumes of the reaction medium, may be employed than would be expected.
