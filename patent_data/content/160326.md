# Process for obtaining fatty acid product from glyceride oil soapstock.

## Abstract
The present invention provides a process for obtaining a fatty acid product from a glyceride oil soapstock. The process includes the following steps a An acidulated soapstock is formed by reacting the glyceride oil soapstock with an aqueous mineral acid solution. b The acidulated soapstock is separated into an aqueous solution and a fatty material emulsified sludge material mixture. c The fatty sludge mixture is dried to a moisture content of less than about 5 , such that the emulsion in the emulsified sludge material is substantially broken. d The dried fatty sludge mixture is separated into the fatty acid product and a solids residue.
