# Current sensor.

## Abstract
A current sensor, integratable with power switching and control circuitry on a common substrate and insulatable from current carrying conductors, utilizes a piezoelectric element 14 located between a pair of current carrying conductors 11, 12 . The conductors 11, 12 carry a current flowing in the same direction, causing an attractive force therebetween to act upon the piezoelectric element 14 and generate a voltage therein proportional to the square of the conductor currents. Use of a pair of sensors, each in a different portion of a half bridge circuit, and associated electronics for providing a sensor output proportional to the instantaneous value of the sensed current, is also des cribed.
