# Electrochemical cell and method for assembling same.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a resealable vent closure for galvanic cells, such as non aqueous oxyhalide cells, which comprises a castellated type of cap 42 employed to compress and retain a resilient deformable member 56 over a vent orifice in the cell s housing such that the compressed resilient deformable member 56 will form a normally tight seal at the vent orifice which will vent and reseal after a predetermined pressure build up within the cell. The invention is also directed to a method for assembling an electrochemical cell, such as a nonaqueous oxyhalide cell, with the above described resealable vent closu re.
