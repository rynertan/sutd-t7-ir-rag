# Polyolefins containing multiple olefinic unsaturation and carboxylic acid groups and process for their preparation.

## Abstract
Terpolymers of a lower olefin, a vinyl ester and a 2 ene carboxylic acid are reacted with water at elevated temperatures to produce polyolefins containing multiple olefinic unsaturation and carboxylic acid groups. Ester groups are converted to olefinic unsaturations by elimination of an acid such as acetic acid. The carboxylic acid groups give the product polymers emulsifiability in water, while the double bonds cause the polymers to be sensitive to ultraviolet light. The polymers are suitable as components in ultraviolet light cured inks, coatings and rubber lubricants and as chemical intermediates for further reaction at the sites of the double bonds.
