IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO 1 BENZOYL 3 ARYLPYRIDYL UREA COMPOUNDS This invention relates to novel benzoylurea derivatives which have been found to be particularly effective as insecticides, and to insecticidal formulations containing those novel compounds. In U.S. Patent No. 3,748,356 there are described a number of 2,6 disubstituted benzoyl derivatives similar to the compounds of the invention. However, the teaching in that patent implies that it is phenyl rather than pyridyl substituted benzoyl ureas which. would be expected to be the more promising insecticidally active compounds. Surprisingly, the Applicants have now discovered that certain arylpyridyl benzoyl ureas of formula I EMI1.1 wherein each R is independently H, Br, C1, F, CH3I or OCH3 with the proviso that both R groups are not simultaneously H, and with the further proviso that when one R group is fluoro or methoxy the other R group is not simultaneously H X O or S n 0 1 RÚ is independently Cl, Br, CH3, or CH3CH2 m 0 2 andR2 is a phenyl radical of the formula EMI2.1 R3 represents Br, Cl, or F R4 represents CF3, OCF3, OC2F5, OCF2CF2H, or SCF3 R5 represents Methyl, Ethyl, Methoxy, Ethoxy, SUCH31 or e CH3CH2 with the limitation that the entire substi tuted phenyl radical bears 1 not more than 4 substituents, when all substituents are halo substituents 2 not more than 3 substituents, when any one substituent is other than halo 3 not more than 2 different substituents and wherein positions on the pyridine ring are as follows 1 the NH to pyridine bond is at the 2 position of the pyridine ring, the R2 group is at the 5 position of the pyridine ring, and when m 1 2, any R1 is at the 4 , 6 , or 4 and 6 positions of the pyridine ring, subject to the limitation that a when simultaneously R1 represents bromo and n 0, m 1 and This at the 6 position b when simultaneously RÚ represents C1 and m 1, R1is at the 6 position c when simultaneously m and n 0 and each R represents OCH3, R2 is not unsubstituted phenyl, 3 chlorophenyl, 3,4 dichlorophenyl, or 4 methoxyphenyl d when simultaneously m and n 0 and each R represents CH3, R2 is not 4 chlorophenyl e when simultaneously m and n 0 and one R represents C1 and the other R represents H, R2 is not 3 chlorophenyl, 3,4 dichlorophenyl, 4 tolyl, 4 methoxyphenyl, or 3,4,5 trimethoxyphenyl f when simultaneously m 2 and n 0 and one R1 moiety represents CH3 or CH3CH2, the other RÚmoiety is not chloro or bromo g when n 1, neitherR group repre sents CH3 or OCH3, any RÚ repre sents CH3 or Cl, and Rê represents a para substituted phenyl in which the substituent is Br, C1, F, CH3, or CF3 h when n 1 and one R group simul taneously represents H, m 1 2 or 2 the NH to pyridine bond is at the 3 position of the pyridine ring, the R2 group is at the 6 position of the pyridine ring, and when m 1, any R1 is at the 5 position of the pyridine ring, subject to the limitation that m 0 1 and a when n 0, R1 represents CH3 or CH3CH2 b when simultaneously n 0 and one R represents C1 and the other R represents H, R2 is not 3 chloro phenyl c when simultaneously n 0 and one R represents CH3 and the other R represents H, R2is not unsubsti tuted phenyl d when n 1, each R independently represents C1 or F, any R1 repre sents CH3, and Rê represents a para substituted phenyl in which the substituent is Br, C1, F, CH3r or CF3 or agriculturally acceptable acid addition salts thereof, are effective insecticidal agents. The compounds of this invention will be named herein as substituted ureas, numbered as follows EMI5.1 Thus the compounds are named as l 2 substituted or 2,6 disubstituted benzoyl 3 5 phenyl or substituted phenyl 2 pyridyl ureas, thioureas, or acid addition salts, as l 2 substituted or 2,6 disubstituted benzoyl 3 5 substituted phenyl 2 pyridyl l oxide ureas or thioureas, as l 2 substituted or 2,6 disubstituted benzoyl 3 6 phenyl or substituted phenyl 3 pyridyl ureas, thioureas, or acid addition salts, or as l 2 substituted or 2,6 disubstituted benzoyl 3 6 substituted phenyl 3 pyridyl l oxide ureas or thioureas. The compounds of the present invention can be prepared by the reaction of a 2 substituted or a 2,6disubstituted benzoyl isocyanate or isothiocyanate of the formulaEMI6.1 with a 2 or 3 pyridylamine of the formulaEMI6.2 or a 1 oxide thereof. The reaction of an isocyanate or isothiocyanate with an amine is a well known type of reaction, cf. U.S. Patents Nos. 3,748,356 and 4,083,977.In general, the reaction is carried out in an organic solvent such as a hydrocarbon, chlorinated hydrocarbon, ethyl acetate or acetonitrile at temperatures of about OOC. to the boiling temperature of the solvent, typi cally from 0 to 1000C. Preferably the reaction is conducted at room temperature. The acid addition salts can be prepared by reacting a benzoyl urea or benzoyl thiourea product with the desired acid, by conventional procedures.Acids having a pKa of 3.0 or lower are preferred, use of mineral acids is most preferred. The benzoyl isocyanates which may serve as the starting materials can be prepared by the reaction of the corresponding benzamide with oxalyl chloride by the method of Speziale et al., J. Orq. Chem. 271 3742 1962 . The benzoyl isothiocyanates can be prepared by reacting the corresponding benzoyl chlorides with an inorganic thiocyanate such as ammonium thiocyanate on lead thiocyanate. The pyridylamines are not well known in the art but may be synthesized by several different adaptations or extensions of literature procedures. Some of these literature procedures are reviewed in Pyridine and Its Derivatives, ed. Klingsberg, especially Parts 2 and 3 Interscience Publishers Inc., N.Y. 1961 and 1962 . Many of the compounds serving as starting materials for synthesis of the pyridylamines are commercially available and all can be prepared according to known procedures. A preferred method for synthesizing certain 2 pyridylamine compounds is presented in synthesis route XI herein below. In this procedure, the cyclization of substituted or non substituted y l hydroxy , benzyloxy , or C1 C3 alkoxyimino Cl C3 alkanei C1 C3 alkylbenzenebutanenitrile or substituted or non substituted y l hydroxy , benzyloxy , or C1 C3 alkoxyimino C1 C3 alkaneibenzenebutanenitrile to form a corresponding 2 pyridylamine is a novel reaction which can be carried out in any one of a number of different solvents.Preferred solvents include chlorinated hydrocarbons, alkylated benzene, halogenated benzene, and nitrobenzene provided that the oximinonitrile is soluble in the solvent and that the boiling point of the solvent is at least 1100C. and preferably higher than 140 C. Preferred catalysts, exemplified herein with methanesulfonic acid, are anhydrous acids which are partially miscible with the solvent and which have a high dissociation constant. A particularly critical stage in this novel synthetic procedure is the addition of the oximino nitride to the mixture of solvent and catalyst. This must be done while the latter mixture is being slowly distilled and stirred in order to insure that the desired cyclization will occur. The reaction mixture is then refluxed and the 2 pyridylamine is subsequently recovered according to conventional procedures. Various synthetic routes which are useful for the preparation of pyridylamine compounds are presented and illustrated as follows. EMI9.1 This synthetic route is illustrated by Examples l ó.

compounds of the present invention are useful for the control of insects of various orders, including Coleoptera such as Mexican bean beetle,Colorado potato beetle, white grubs Diptera, such as yellow fever mosquitoes, house fly Lepidoptera, such as European corn borer, corn earworm, tobacco budworm, Egyptian cotton leafworm, southern armyworm, fall army worm, sod webworm, tobacco hornworm, loopers, beet armyworm, diamond back moth, imported cabbage worm Orthoptera, such as German cockroach, American cockroach and Thysanoptera, such as thrips. The compounds of the present invention are additionally useful for the control of other insects such as horn fly, common cattle grub, stable fly, face fly, mosquitoes, screwworm, tabanid fly, army cutworm, midges, southwester 1 corn borer, lesser cornstalk borer, horse bot fly, cabbage maggot, velvet bean caterpillar, pecan nut casebearer, pink bollworm, hickory shuckworm, walnut caterpillar, green cloverworm, alfalfa caterpillar, leaf miner fly, yellowstriped armyworm, rednecked peanutworm, stalk borer, sunflower moth, tomato pin worm, Oriental fruit moth, lum curculio, peachtree borer, melon fly, lesser peachtree borer, grape root borer, black fly, nose bot fly, grape berry moth, sheep ked, leaf rollers, and spruce bud worms. It is believed that the present compounds act by interfering with the mechanism of metamorphosis which occurs in insects, causing the death of the insects. It is also believed that ingestion by the insects is necessary to invoke this mechanism. While the death of any given insect may be delayed until that insect reaches some stage of metamorphosis, the net result of this activity is the control and suppression of insects. Therefore, in another embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method of suppressing insects which comprises applying to a locus of the insects an effective amount of a compound of the present invention. The locus can be any environment inhabited by insects to be controlled, such as soil, air, water, foods, vegetation, manure, inert objects, stored matter such as grain, and the like. The compounds of the invention will normally be applied by spraying, to the locus in an amount varying from 3.001 to 10 Ibs acre depending on the nature of the locus and the type and severity of the insect infestation.Preferably the compounds are applied in an amount varying from 0.1 to 1 lb acre. Preferably the compounds of the present invention are supplied in a formulation, for ease of application. The compounds can be formulated with various adjuvants, including water, organic liquids, surface active agents, inert solids, and the like.Suitable surface active agents include anionic agents, such as sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium dodeczlber.zene sulfonate, and the like and nonionic agents, such as polyoxyethylene glycol nonylphenyl ether. Mixtures are often desirably employed. The formulation can take the form of a liquid, dust, granule, aerosol, and so forth containing from 0.1 to 80 of a compound of the invention. Specifically the formulation may be an emulsifiable concentrate having 12 50 actives, a wettable powder having up to 80 actives, a granule having up to 10 . actives, and a dust having up to 1.25 actives. In addition to the amounts of actives specified, the balance of the ingredients for the previously listed formulations is comprised of the various adjuvants listed above.These adjuvants and their use in formulations such as those exemplified herein, are well known and appreciated in the art. Moreover it is understood that those with ordinary skill will readily select one or more of the above or different adjuvants for use in formulating the present compounds in accordance with the percentages disclosed above. The formulations also can be designed to slowly release the active compound or to make the active compound immediately available. Many methods of formulation are known in the art and can be employed to impiement the present invention.

It can be obtained from Kelco Corporation, Division of Merck, Rahway, New Jersey 07066. Ethylene glycol is used to give the formulation freeze thaw stability. The concentration of active agent in the formulation is not critical, inasmuch as an effective concentration will vary with the nature of the locus to be treated, the severity of insect infestation, the susceptibility of the particular insects involved, etc.In general, concentrations ranging from about 0.1 to 1000 ppm give good results. As exemplified by Table 2, below, lesser concentrations of from about 5 to about 100 ppm have given good control of southern armyworm larvae. The use of insecticides by oral administration to animals for the control of manure breeding insects is a rather new concept in insect control. At the present time, only a few insecticides are so used, of which a standard reference compound is diflubenzuron, 1 2,6 difluorobenzoyl 3 4 chlorophenyl urea. The compounds are active against the larvae of insects which breed in manure, especially insects of the order Diptera. Especially important manurebreeding insects, against which the method of this invention is particularly effective, include the house fly Musca domestica , the stable fly Stomoxys calci rans , the horn fly Haematobia irritans , and the face fly Musca autumnalis . Therefore in another embodiment, the compounds of the present invention are orally administered to the animals to be treated, and pass essentially unchanged through the alimentary tract of the animal.The compound thus is excreted in the animal s feces, where it is effective against the larvae of insects.The animals which may be treated. in accordance with the present method include especially poultry, such as for example, chickens, ducks, turkeys and geese ruminants, such as for example, cattle, sheep and goats and economic monogastic animals, such as for example, horses and swine. The compounds may also be used, if desired, in carnivorous animals, such as chose of the cat and dog families. Use of the method of this invention in poultry, especially chickens, and in ruminants, especially bovines, is most highly preferred. The exact means by which the compounds used in the method of this invention are administered to the animals is not critical. It is easiest and most convenient to mix the compound in the animal 8 feed. When the compounds are administered as feed additives, they may be used in concentrations in the feed ranging from about 1 ppm. to about 50 ppm. by weight. A preferred range of concentration is from about 1 ppm. to about 10 ppm. by weight. The formulation of feed additives into animal feeds is a well known art. It is usual to make a concentrated premix as a raw material for treated feeds. The formulation of the premix is guided solely by convenience in mixing feed from the premix, and by economy. The premix may contain from about 1 to about 400 g. 1b. of the insecticide, depending on convenience in mixing feed containing the desired concentration of the compound. Premixes may be either liquid or solid. The improved feed premises which are provided by this invention and which are novel because of the presence of the insecticides used in. the method of this invention, are formulated in any of the conventionallyused physiologically acceptable carriers. Liquid carriers which are suitable for premix use include glycols such as for example polyethylene glycols of various molecular weights and propylene glycol, invert oils including vegetable oils and hihly refined mineral oil, and physiologically acceptable alcohols such as ethanol.Solid premix carriers include, for example, vermiculite, diatomaceous earth, physiologically acceptable clays such as attapulgite and montmorillonite, and granulated or powdered feed components such as cracked corn, soybean meal, alfalfa meal, rice hulls, corn cobs, cracked wheat or oats, and waste materials of grain processing. It will further be understood by those skilled in animal husbandry that animal feeds containing from about I ppm. to about 50 ppm. by weight of a compound useful in the method of this invention are novel and are important embodiments of the invention. Such feeds may preferably be in the form of cereal based feeds, adapted to the needs of poultry, ruminants and or monogastric animals such as horses and swine. The usual dry or slurried animal feeds, based on grains such as wheat, oats, barley, maize and the like, may be treated with compounds used in the method of this invention, just as animal feeds are routinely treated with medicaments and parasiticides in the ordinary practice of the animal husbandry art. The compounds may also be administered as additives to the animal s drinking water, in which case they should be used in a concentration of from about 1 ppm. to about 30 ppm., preferably from about 1 ppm.to about 15 ppm. Administration of the compounds by means of sustained release boluses is particularly advantageous when ruminants, especially cattle, are to be treated.Such boluses are made as tablets are made, except that a means to delay the dissolution of the compound over a period of time is provided. Boluses may be made to release the compound steadily over long periods of time, even 100 days or more. A number of polymeric substances have been used to prepare slow release boluses particularly effective polymers are the copolymers of polylactic and polyglycolic acids. It is necessary to retain a slow release bolus in the rumen of the treated ruminant, so that the bolus is not carried on out of the digestive tract. Boluses are retained in the rumen most easily by making them of a high density material, as by mixing metal particles into the composition, or by providing wings which open in the rumen and make the bolus too large to get through the opening into the omasum of the animal.Boluses should release from about 0.01 mg. kg. of body weight day to about 2 mg. kg. day, preferably from about 0.01 to about 0.25 mg. kg. day. The compounds may also be administered in the form of pharmaceutical dosage forms, such as tablets, capsules, drenches, suspensions and the lnlce, but administration in such forms is usually not preferred because of the relative inconvenience of such administration. Mineral blocks provide another advantageous formulation with which to administer the insecticides, particularly to ruminant animals. Such blocks are usually supplied to ruminants, even to those on pasture.The usual blocks are highly compressed forms of physiologically desirable salts and nutritive substances, generally including phosphates, carbonates, halides, calcium salts, trace elements such as zinc, cobalt, manganese and the like, vitamins, steroids, and lubricants and binders to assist in compression. Mineral blocks are old in the animal husbandry art. The addition of the insecticides of the present method, however, provides novel blocks which are important embodiments of the present invention.The insecticides should be added to the blocks in concentrations from about 0.01 to about 0.5 , preferably from about 0.05 to about 0.25 . It is necessary to administer at least an insecticidally effective amount of compound to the animal to be treated. It is most effective to measure the amount administered, however, as a concentration in the medium with which it is combined. Effective insecticidal amounts, or concentrations, are described above. It is not implied that administration of any amount of any compound used in the method of this invention will kill all larvae of all manure breeding insects. It is not in the nature of biological methods to be invariably 100 effective. However, the oral administration of a compound of the present method, in an insecticidally effective amount, will produce a worthwhile reduction in the number of insect larvae which mature in the manure of the treated animal. In many cases complete control of the larvae will result, and no adults will develop.It is understood that partial control of the manure breeding insects is significant and beneficial, and that the population of the insects is usefully reduced, even though not all of them may be killed by the insecticidal treatment. Control of manure breeding insects in accordance with the present invention is, clearly, more convenient and effective than is insect control by traditional methods of applying insecticides to the manure after it has been gathered and piled. The added operation of spraying or dusting insecticides over the manure is avoided. More importantly, the method of this invention results in the insecticidal compounds being intimately mixed through the mass of the manure, so that any larvae in the mass are sure to come into contact with the compound. While all the compounds of the present invention show considerable efficacy in the control and eradication of undesirable insect pests, certain compounds are more effective than others. Accordingly, preferred compounds of the present invention are those wherein each R is independently chloro or fluoro,X 0, n 0, the NH to pyridine bond is at the 2position of the pyridine ring, R2is at the position of the pyridine ring and represents 4 bromo or 4 chlorophenyl, and R1 is at the 4 , 6 , or 4 and 6positions of the pyridine ring and represents chloro or methyl. Gne of the most useful compounds of this preferred group has been shown to be 1 2, 6 difluoro benzOyl 3 i 4 chlorophenyl 4,6 diethyl 2 pyridvl urea. While it is understood that there are many other useful and potentially important embodiments of the present invention, the preferred embodiment is as disclosed herein above. The insecticidal activity of the present compounds was determined by testing the efficacy of romula ons of the compounds against Mexican bean beetle larvae Epilachna varivestis , and against southern armyworm larvae Spodoptera eridania . These insects are members of the Coleoptera and Lepidoptera orders of insects, respectively. The formulations were applied to the foliage of plants and the larvae were subsequently permitted to feed on the foliage. The compounds were tested in a plurality of concentrations, from a concentration of about 1000 ppm. to about 1 ppm. Each compound to be tested was formulated by dissolving the compound in a solvent made up with small amounts of Toximul R and Toximul S, typically 5.9 grams and 4.0 grams, respectively, per liter of 1 1 anhydrous ethanol and acetone. Water was then added to obtain a solution containing the compound in a concentration of 1000 parts per million. A portion was diluted further with water containing small amounts of Toximul R andToximul S, to obtain treating solutions of lesser concentrations. It is understood that those skilled in the art will vary the amounts of water and Toximul R and Toximul S depending on the particular concentration of active compound desired. Each of Toximul R andToximul S is a sulfonate nonionic blend produced byStepan Chemical Company, Northfield, Illinois. Each solution of test compound was sprayed onto two 4 inch square pots of bean plants containing 6 to 10 plants per pot. The plants were allowed to dry and then 12 leaves were removed and the cut ends wrapped in water soaked cellucotton. The leaves were divided between six 100 x 20 mm. plastic petri dishes.Five second instar Mexican bean beetle larvae Epilachna varivestis and five second and third instar southern armyworm larvae Spodoptera eridania were placed in each of three dishes. The dishes were then placed in a room wherein the temperature and relative humidity were controlled at about 78 oF. and about 51 percent, respectively, for a period of four days, at which time the first evaluation of the effects of the test compounds was made. After this evaluation, two fresh leaves from the original treated pots were placed in each dish. The dishes were again maintained in the temperature and humidity controlled room for an adadditional three days until the final seven day evaluation was made. Insecticidal effect was determined by counting the number of living larvae per dish. All the treatments were compared to solvent controls and nontreated controls. The rating code percent of control used was as follows 0 0 1 1 50 2 51 99 3 1008 control The results of this test are set forth inTable 1, which follows. In the table column 1 identifies the compounds by the number of the preparative example column 2 lists the concentration of the test compound in the formulation and columns 3 through 6 give the Rating Code at days 4 and 7 for the two insects against which the compounds were tested.

A test was done to determine the ovicidal activity of a representative compound of the present invention against the eggs of a typical insect such as, for example, Egyptian cotton leafworm Spodoptera littoralis . In this test the adult insects were allowed to lay their eggs on filter paper. The eggs were treated by dipping the filter paper containing the eggs into solutions of the test compound which were prepared by dissolving 10 mg. of the test compound in 1 ml. of a solvent which per liter contained 50 percentV V each of acetone and ethanol and 23 g. of Toximol R and 13 g. of Toxn mol S. The dissolved test compound was dispersed in 9 ml. of distilled water to make up a stock dispersion containing 500 mg. L. Lower concentrations were made by preparing dilutions of the stock dispersion.The test compound was evaluated at concen traJ ions of 500 mg. L. and 50 mg. L. and the test compound was that of Example 71. The results of the experiment showed that at two and six days after treatment at 500 mg. L., the ovicidal effect was 10 percent and 100 percent respectively. At 50 ms. L. over the same time interval, the ovicidal effect was somewhat reduced although still at 2 percent and 95 percent respectively. The chemosterilant activity of the present compounds was determined by dissolving a representative compound in acetone and then dipping adult boll weevils Anthonomus grandis into the solution. The treated insects were air dried and cultured under controlled conditions. Eggs were collected and the chemosterilant activity was determined by comparing the number of nonviable eggs collected from the treated adults with the number of nonviable eggs collected from a control group. The mean mortality of the adults in both the treated and control groups was also determined. The results are presented below in Table 3.The percent control was defined as follows No. of viable eggs from treated adults . No. of viable eggs from control adults Table 3 Chemosterilant Activity Against Boll Weevil Ovicidal Activity Mean Adult Percent Control Mortality Mean Nonviable Eggs Example Days after Appln.

The cabbage was allowed to dry for 24 hours and then leaf discs portions of the leaves were fed to 50 second instar larvae of Egyptian cotton leafworm Spodoptera littoralis in petri dishes under controlled conditions. The leaf discs were changed as often as was necessary to maintain cleanliness and an adequate food supply.The percent control was determined at 2, 3, 5, and 8 day intervals as follows No. of dead treated larvae No. of dead control larvae 100 No. of surviving control larrae The plants from which the leaf discs were obtained were bottom watered after spraying so as to avoid erosion of the insecticides.

Provides 75 mg. of manganese, 50 mg. of zinc, 25 mg. of iron, and 1 mg. of iodine per kg. of complete feed.The above feed was medicated by mixing with the test compound and thus medicated feeds with varying concentrations of the active ingredient were prepared. The concentration of the active compound in the test diet was 3.8, 7.5, and 15 ppm and feed at each concentration level was fed to at least 4 birds divided into at least 2 pens providing replicate groups per concentration. Birds were randomly allotted to the 3 treatments with 4 nontreated birds divided into 2 groups to serve as negative controls. The birds were fed ad libitum with the medicased rations. At the end of 6 weeks all medicated feeds were withdrawn and the nonmedicated basal ratio was placed in the feeders for an additional 3 weeds. Approximately 500 grams of feces were collected on the mornings of test days 0, 7, 1t, 21, 23, 35, 42, 49, 56, and 63 from each pen. The fecal samples were properly identified and stored in a cold room at 340F. until bioassayed for insecticidal activity. About 50 ml. or water were mixed with each 500 gram fecal sample in one quart plastic containers and 100 housefly eggs were seeded on each manure sample. The thus prepared samples were covered with muslin and maintained at room temperature until evaluated. Larval development, pupal formation, and adult emergence were observed and recorded. Insecticidal effect was determined by counting the number of pupae or adult flies per sample and comparing with the number in the nonmedicated control samples. The insecticidal activity was expressed as a percent control which was defined as follows below. No. of pupae or adults No. of pupae or adults in control in medicated sample No. of pupae or adults in controlThe results are presented in Table 12.
