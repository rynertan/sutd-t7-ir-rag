# Connector member adapted for ultraviolet antimicrobial irradiation.

## Abstract
A connector member 11 is disclosed for sealed connec tion with a second connector member 30 , to permit sealed flow of material through the joined connector members. The connector member 11 is made of a material selected from the group consisting of aliphatic hydrocarbon resins, alipha tic polyester resins, copolymers of olefins and vinyl acetate, and olefin acrylate copolymers. The material also contains an effective amount of an antioxidant agent being selected to provide to the material the characteristic of permitting transmission of at least 15 percent of at least one wavelength of ultraviolet radiation having a wavelength between 220 and 300 nanometers through a thickness of 0.003 inch of the material.
