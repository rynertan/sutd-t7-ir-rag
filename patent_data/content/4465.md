# METHOD OF REGENERATING ADSORBENTS

## Abstract
Water and carbon dioxide contaminants are removed from a feed gas stream by adsorption in first and second adsorbent zones arranged in series. Regeneration of the adsorbent zones is accomplished by a introducing a heated regeneration gas intermediate the first and second adsorbent zones and passing the heated regeneration gas through the first adsorbent zone and b subsequently passing a low temperature regeneration gas sequentially through the second and first adsorbent zones.
