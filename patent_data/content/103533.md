# ANTI THEFT APPARATUS FOR MOTOR VEHICLES

## Abstract
Anti theft apparatus is described for use in motor vehicles which include a vacuum source 16 generating a vacuum when the vehicle engine 14 is running. The anti theft ap paratus comprises a disabling device 22 for disabling normal operation of the vehicle, a releasing device 24 for releasing the latter to permit normal operation of the vehicle, and a vacuum control device 34 which includes a manipulatable member, in the form of a removable piston key, effective to connect the vacuum source 16 to the releasing device 24 , to cause it to release the disabling device 22 and thereby to permit normal operation of the vehicle, only when the piston key is in a preselected position in the vacuum control device 34 . The disabling device 22 acts on the gearshift lever 20 locking it in its park position. In a second embodiment it acts on the fuel feed line blocking the full flow of fuel to the engine.
