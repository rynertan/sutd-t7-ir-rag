## Description
PROCESS AND INTERMEDIATES FOR PRODUCTION OF BENZOTHIAZINE CARBOXAMIDES The invention relates to a novel class of compounds of empirical formula CgH7N205SRRlZ which are useful as 9725 intermediates in an improved process for production of benzothiazine carboxamide anti inflammatory agents. Two methods for synthesis of N substituted benzothiazine carboxamide anti inflammatory agents are disclosed in U.S 3,591,584. The first of these is used to prepare carboxamides in which the N substituent is not an heterocyclic moiety. It comprises contacting an organic isocyanate,,R3NCO, wherein R3 is, e.g.certain alkyl, phenyl or naphthyl groups, with a 4 oxo or 3 oxo l,2 benzothiazine to produce e.g., the compound of the formulaEMI1.1 or the corresponding 3 oxo 4 carboxamide. A second method is preferred for the preparation of those amides wherein the N substituent is an heterocyclic moiety it involves reaction of the corresponding carboxylic acid ester with the appropriate amine, R2NH2, where R2 is a heterocyclic group, to produce the desired benzothiazine carboxamide, e.g.,EMI2.1 In U.S. 3,891,637 a process is disclosed whereby the N heterocyclic amides of formula VII are obtained from the corresponding N phenyl amides by a transamidation process. U.S. 3,853,862 discloses a process for production of 4 oxo 1,2 benzothiazine 3 carboxamides of formula VII by cyclization of a benzenesulfonylglycineamide III in the presence of a metal hydride, e.g.,EMI2.2 U.S. 4,289,879, issued September 15, 1981, discloses a method for preparing piroxicam 4 hydroxy 2 methyl N 2 pyridyl 2E 1,2 benzothiazine 3 carbox amide 1,l dioxide via the corresponding 3 2 methoxyethyl ester. In accordance with the present invention, it has now been found that a novel class of compounds of the empirical formula C9H7N205SRR1z I is obtained by reacting an ester of formulaEMI3.1 with an equimolar amount of an amine of the formula ZNB2 in the presence of reaction inert organic solvent at a temperature of from about 0 to 1100C, wherein R is hydrogen, benzyl or alkyl having from one to three carbon atoms R1 is benzyl or alkyl having from one to four carbon atoms and Z is benzopyronyl, alkyl substituted benzopyronyl, 2 pyridyl, alkyl substituted2 pyridyl, 2 thiazolyl, 2 thiazolyl substituted by one or two alkyl groups, or 5 alkyl 3 isoxazolyl, each alkyl having from one to four carbon atoms, can be prepared and isolated in good yield. The compounds of formula I are of as yet undefined structure. The present invention also provides a novel process for production of 4 oxo 1,2 benzothiazine 3carboxamide l,l dioxide anti inflammatory agents of the formula IV , said process having significant advantages over prior art methods. EMI4.1 wherein R and Z are as.defined above, which comprises the steps of a reacting a 4 oxo 1,2 benzothiazine 3 carboxylic acid ester of the formulaEMI4.2 with an equimolar amount of an amine of the formula ZNH2 in the presence of a reaction inert organic solvent and at a temperature of from 0 to 110 C to provide an intermediate of empirical formula CgH7X2O5SRRÚZ I b heating the intermediate obtained in a in the presence of a reaction inert organic solvent at a temperature of from about 120 to 2000C to eliminate R1OH where R1 is as defined above. In the compounds of the invention of formula I and in the process of the invention particularly preferred values for substituents R, R1 and Z are R is alkyl having from one to three carbon atoms, R1 is alkyl having from one to four carbon atoms, and Z is 2 pyridyl, 2 thiazolyl, 5 methyl 3 isoxazolyl, 6 methyl 2 pyridyl or 4,5 dimethyl 2 thiazolyl. More particularly preferred values for the above substituents are R is methyl, R1 is methyl or ethyl, and Z is 2 pyridyl, 2 thiazolyl or 5 methyl 3 isoxazolyl. The most particularly preferred compound of the invention is of formula I where R and R1 are each methyl and Z is 2 pyridyl. The corresponding antiinflammatory agent of formula IV provided by the invention process is known generically as piroxicam . See, e.g., Wiseman, Roy. Soc. Med. Int. Cong. Symp.Ser. 1, 11 23 1978 . The invention process has advantages of improved yield and increased productivity which affords a significantly greater weight of product of formula IV per volume of solvent. The product of formula IV obtained by the invention process is also of improved purity. A further advantage of the invention process is that the mother liquors can be recycled repeatedly to the next batch with good results. Isolation of the intermediate of formula I in the process of the invention affords an additional purification, not possible in the prior art process.Thus, in the instant process, one may use starting materials of lesser purity since they are purified by isolation of the intermediate compound I . This is a distinct advantage since an impure amine ZONE2 can be employed without reduction of purity of the antiinflammatory agent IV . Furthermore, it is known in the art that amines, of the formula ZNEz as defined above are difficult to purify by prior art methods. The compounds of the invention of the formula I are obtained by contacting approximately equimolar amounts of 4 oxo 1,2benzothiazine 3 carboxylic acid ester of formula II and the appropriate amine, ZNH2, where Z is as previously defined. The reaction is carried out in the presence of a reaction inert organic solvent at a temperature of from about 0 to 1100C and a reaction time of up to twenty four hours.An especially preferred range of temperature for this reaction is from about 20 to 90do, at which temperature the reaction is ordinarily complete in from a few minutes to a few hours, for example, 15 minutes to about four hours. The product of formula I is then isolated, if desired, e.g., by cooling the reaction mixture to room temperature or below, filtering to collect the precipitated solid, and drying, A reaction inert organic solvent as defined herein is one that does not react appreciably with either the starting materials or the products of the reaction under the reaction conditions employed, and is capable of dissolving at least a substantial portion of the starting materials at or below the reaction temperature. Further, said solvent is one from which the desired product is readily recoverable by standard techniques known to one of skill in the art. Examples of reaction inert organic solvents which can be employed in preparing the desired compounds of formula I are hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, the xylenes, ethylbenzene, tetralin and decalin halogenated hydrocarbons such as chloroform, methylene dichloride, ethylene dichloride, ethyl bromide and ethylene dibromide ketones such as acetone and methylethylketone, ethers such as ethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, 1,2 dimethoxyethane and diethyleneglycol dimethylether dialkylamides such as dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide and N methyl 2pyrrolidinone dimethylsulfoxide and acetonitrile. Particularly preferred are the above solvents having an atmospheric boiling point at least as high as the maximum reaction temperature employed. Especially preferred is commercial mixed xylenes for reasons of economy and efficiency. Initial studies on the products of formula I suggested covalent bonding between the amine and ester to form a structure analogous to the classical un stable intermediate for such reactions. However, the results of further investigation strongly suggest that a 1 1 molar adduct is a more accurate representation of the structure of the compounds of empirical formula I . The 13C NMR and 1H NMR spectral evidence and the presence of two carbonyl bands in the infrared spectrum, particularly, are consistent with such an adduct. As mentioned above, the compounds of formula I are useful as intermediates in production of anti inflammatory agents of the formula IV by elimination of R1OH.EMI7.1 The above reaction is also carried out in the .presence of one of the particularly preferred reaction inert organic solvents, defined above, but at an elevated temperature in order to drive out the alcohol generated in the reaction. A preferred temperature for this reaction is from about 120 to 2000C and especially preferred is about 135 to 1450C. The reaction inert organic solvents that can be used in production of compounds of formula IV by the above reaction are the same as those given above for the production of the invention compounds of formula I , except those which boil at a temperature substantially below the preferred range of temperature, and would thus require the use of high pressure equipment. Especially preferred solvents for this reaction are toluene, the xylenes, ethylbenzene, tetralin and decal in and most especially preferred is mixed xylenes for reasons of economy and efficiency.Of course, as one of skill in the art will recognize, the mixed xylenes also have the advantage of having a boiling point within the especially preferred range of temperature, a feature which facilitates temperature regulation and removal of by product alcohol, R1 OH. In the first step of the invention process the formation of a solid intermediate product of formula I provides a purification method not possible with the prior art process in which the ester II and amine ZNH2 are reacted to form IV directly. Thus, relatively impure starting materials of formula II and ZNE2 can be employed in the instant process and purification effected by isolation of the novel intermediate of formula I prior to its conversion to the anti inflammatory agent, IV . A further advantage of the present process is that the desired product IV can be obtained in improved yield and with greater throughput than is possible with the most favorable prior art process, i.e., the method of U.S. 3,591,584 described above for production of benzothiazine 3 carboxamides via the corresponding 3 carboxylic acid ester and a heterocyclic amine such as ZNH2 where Z is as defined herein. In the prior art method when total concentration of reactants greater than about 3 g per 100 ml of solvent are employed, the reaction mixture produces relatively high levels of decomposition products and color bodies, which makes isolation of the desired product of formula IV difficult and renders an impure product not suitable for pharmaceutical use without further costly purification steps. The present process, however, can be carried out in such a manner that the throughput can be increased in Step b to 6 8 grams per 100 ml, or higher, without sacrificing yield of product or its purity.This is accomplished by isolating the novel intermediate compound of formula I obtained in Step a and adding it in portions to the heated solvent mixture employed in Step b to eliminate the elements of R1OH and form the product IV in high yield and purity. Yet another advantage that can be demonstrated with the invention process is that the mother liquors can be recycled repeatedly to the next reaction run.High yield and high purity of product is observed after repeated recycling of mother liquors in the instant process, thus avoiding loss of product retained in the mother liquor. By contrast, when recycling is carried out with the prior art process, accumulation of impurities becomes so great after a few recycles of mother liquor that the desired product can not be isolated or can only be isolated with great difficulty. The following Examples are illustrative of the claimed invention.

The mixture is heated to 800C with vigorous stirring, held at this temperature for two hours, cooled to room temperature, filtered and dried to obtain 158.6 g 98 of the desired complex as yellow crystals, m.p. 132 1330C.

Addition of 1.0 equivalent of methyl 3,4 dihydro2 methyl 4 oxo 2H l,2 benzothiazine 3 carboxylate 1,1dioxide to a sample of the above product in dimethylsulfoxide produced an increase in 11 of the lines of the 13C NMR spectrum, with slight changes in chemical shift. This clearly shows that in solution there is a rapid exchange during the NMR time scale. EXAMPLE 2 To 13 ml acetone is added 2.69 g 0.01 mole methyl 3 ,4 dihydro 2 methyl 4 oxo 2H l, 2 benzothia zine 3 carboxylate l,l dioxide and 0.94 g 0.01 mole 2 aminopyridine and the mixture warmed to affect solution. The yellow solution is refrigerated until precipitation is complete, filtered and the yellow crystals dried to afford the compound I , R R1 CH3, Z 2 pyridyl, m.p. 132 133 C, in 84 yield. The above procedure is repeated on the same scale, but employing a wide variety of reaction inert organic solvents in place of acetone. The results are summarized in the table, below.

When the ester reactant II is used in excess, it sometimes forms as white crystals adhering to the sides of the flask which are readily separated from the yellow crystals of formula I . When the procedure is repeated in tetrahydrofuran at OOC or in toluene at 110 C, the results are substantially the same.

To a one liter flask purged with nitrogen is added 300 ml mixed xylenes, 120 g 0.446 mole methyl 3,4 dihydro 2 methyl 4 oxo 2H 1,2 benzothiazine 3 carboxylate l,l dioxide and 48 g 0.510 mole 2aminopyridine. The mixture is heated to 900C, stirred rapidly at this temperature for one hour and allowed to cool under a nitrogen atmosphere. To a five liter flask containing 3300 ml xylene is added 12 g of activated carbon Darco G 60 and the mixture heated at reflux while collecting xylene water in a separator decanter. To this is added one half of the above xylene slurry of the intermediate compound of formula I obtained above. The mixture is brought to reflux and methanol xylene distilled off at a rate of 25 mi per hour while adding fresh xylene to maintain a reaction volume of about 3500 ml.After four hours, one third of remaining slurry of the intermediate compound is added and methanol xylene distillation resumed at the same rate. The remaining portions one third or remainder of intermediate are added at 8 hours and 12 hours, respectively, and the distillation continued at 25 ml hour for a total of 16 hours. After 16 hours the distillation rate is decreased to 12.5 ml per hour for a total of 34 hours. The reaction mixture is cooled to about 1000C, and filtered to remove carbon, washing the carbon cake with 100 ml warm xylene.
