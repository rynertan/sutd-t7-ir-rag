# Transit vehicle control apparatus and method.

## Abstract
Apparatus and method for a passenger transit vehicle running on a track, for speed control at specific locations such as a station the apparatus uses first and second sets of sensing coils on board the train, cooperating with a track embedded two wire antenna which is transposed at known periodic intervals of distance a plurality of vehicle carried signal receivers comprising said sensing coils operative with the transposed signal transmitting cable antenna for provid ing an initial and higher speed position determination and then a lower speed and more accurate position determination for stopping the vehicle at a desired location. The sensing coils are so spaced with respect to said trans position interval that a higher stopping accuracy than what is possible in prior art is achieved.
