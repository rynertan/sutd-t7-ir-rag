## Description
FIELD EFFECT TRANSISTOR BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to field effect transistors, and more particularly to a compound semiconductor field effect transistor. Various proposals have been made for improving the performance of field effect transistors. In GaAs MESFET being one sort of the compound semiconductor field effect transistors, a structure as shown in Fig. 1 has been proposed in order to improve the performance Journal of Technical Disclosure Vol. 6 16,No. 81 4352 . The structure comprises a semi insulating GaAs substrate 1, an active n layer 2, and a burried p layer 3 provided between the substrate 1 and the layer 2. The main role of the burried p layer 3 is to suppress the short channel effect. The short channel effect is the phenomenon that as the gate length L is decreased the threshold voltage is significantly shifted to the negative direction. In other words, the short channel effect is a phenomenon produced in that electrons injected from a source n layer 5 to the semi insulating GaAs substrate 1 flow into a drain n layer 6, so to speak, in addition to current path flowing through the active n layer 2 there is other current path flowing through the semi insulating GaAs substrate 1. Consequently, the burried p layer 3 is provided so that a barrier at side of the substrate is made high.In this constitution, injection of electrons to the substrate 1 is suppressed and the above mentioned other current path is eliminated so as to suppress the short channel effect. The burried p layer 3 in this structure is of low concentration and totally depleted, so that parasitic capacitance between the active n layer 2 and the burried p layer 3 or between the n layers 5, 6 and the burried p layer 3 is reduced and the element can act at high speed.Numeral 7 designates a gate electrode, numeral 8 a source electrode, and numeral 9 a drain electrode. Similar device is disclosed also in Japanese patent application laid openNo. 211783 1982. However, the inventor has found that the GaAsMESFET with above mentioned structure is weak to ot particle. That is, a memory such as SRAM Static Random Access Memory constituted using this element is subjected to destruction of the stored information every time the particle is entered. This phenomeon is called soft error. Soft error in Si device was found by T.C May andM.H. Woods in 1979 T.C May and M.H. Woods, IEEE Trans,Electron Device, ED 26, p2, 1979 . Generating mechanism of the soft error in the Si device is usually thought as follows. The stored information is held as existence of charge stored in a capacitor of a memory cell in the case of DRAM Dynamic Random AccessMemory and as height of potential at node in a memory cell in the case of SRAM. When one d particle is entered in theSi substrate, pairs of electrons and positive holes of 106 in number are generated along the i particle track in the Si substrate, and carriers of the electrons or the positive holes are diffused or drifted in the substrate and flow in the capacitor or the node. Therefore the charge amount stored in the capacitor or the potential of the node varies significantly and the memory information held therein is destroyed.Also in the SRAM constituted using the GaAsMESFET having the burried p layer as shown in Fig. 1, the soft error seems to be generated in similar mechanism. Next, difference in the soft error phenomenon between the Si device and the GaAs MESFET having the structure of Fig. 1 will be described. In the Si device, if the carriers generated along the track of one particle are 106 in the total number, the total amount of the charge flowing in the capacitor or the node is 160 fC at most corresponding to flowing in of all generated carriers and not beyond 160 fC. The inventor has repeated the measurements in the operation state of the GaAs MESFET having the structure ofFig. 1, and has found the difference between the GaAs MESFET and the Si device as follows. In the GaAs MESFET having the structure of Fig. 1, the charge amount flowing in the capacitor or the node becomes several times larger than in the Si deviceWhen one i particle is entered. This phenomenon means that the GaAs MESFET having the structure of Fig. 1 is liable to the soft error by the particles in comparison to the Si device. This phenomenon means also that carrier multiplication mechanism to multiply the charge flowing in the node exists in the GaAs MESFET having the structure of Fig. 1. As one of the carrier multiplication mechanism, the inventor has found existence of following mechanism. In this mechanism, the total amount of any of the positive charge due to positive hole and the negative charge due to electron is equal quality of 160 fC. Since the burried p layer 6 of the conventional structure is totally depleted, when voltage is applied to the drain n layer 6, electric line of force extends from the drain n layer 6 to the source n layer 5 thereby drift of the generated carriers is promoted by the electric line of force. Mobility of electron to determine the drift speed of carriers in GaAs is ten times or more in comparison to that of positive hole.Consequently, after electrons are completely absorbed to the drain n layer 6, positive holes still remain in the substrate. Potential barrier at side of the substrate is lowered, and injection of electrons from the source n layer 5 is promoted, thereby subsidiary current path is formed and new current flows in the drain side. Thus mechanism similar to the mechanism of short channel effect acts. Since the flowing in charge becomes several times of 160 fC, carrier multiplication is observed. In the above description, since conduction type of the active layer 2, the source region 5 and the drain region 6 in Fig. 1 is made n type and conduction type of the burried layer 3 is made p type, positive holes generated by partic1es remain in the substrate and the carrier multiplication occurs. On the contrary, if conduction type of the active layer 2, the source region 5 and the drain region 6 in Fig. 1 is made p type and conduction type of the burried layer 3 is made n type, the multiplication effect of carriers does not occur. Because the positive holes generated by d particles remain in the substrate so as to suppress injection of positive holes from the source side.In this case, however, if one d particle enters the device, the total amount of charge flowing in the electrode becomes about 140 fC at maximum value and is still too large to avoid the soft error. As above described, in the structure of providing the totally depleated burried layer under the active layer in order to prevent the short channel effect, soft errors due to M particlescannot be completely prevented. Accordingly, a field effect transistor with a structure capable to prevent soft errors due to i particleshas been desired. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the invention is to provide a field effect transistor which is immune to d particles. Another object of the invention is to provide a field effect transistor which can prevent the s1iort channe l effect and Ssoft errors. In order to attain the. above objects, a field effect transistor of the invention comprises a semiconductor layer to constitute source region, drain region and an active layer, and another semiconductor layer which is contacted to the semiconductor layer and conductive in the reverse conduction type with respect to the above mentioned semiconductor layer and not totally depleted, so as to prevent the short channel effect and the soft error.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In an element structure according to the invention, in order to suppress the carrier multiplication and prevent the soft error, for example, a burried p layer 13 being not totally depleted is formed under an active n layer 12 or under n layers 15, 16 as shown in Fig. 2. Carrier concentration of the burried p layer 13 being not totally depleted is 1015 cm 3 or more and preferably 1016 cm 3 or more. If the carrier concentration is less than 1015 cm 3, the layer is depleted and the carrier multiplication will occur.Therefore the carrier concentration is preferably 1015 cm 3 at least. Further, if the carrier concentration is 1016 cm 3 or more, it can be easily controlled. It is therefore preferable in practice that the carrier concentration becomes 1016 cm 3 or more. A control electrode 17 is installed to control potential of the burried layer 13. The control electrode 17 is not essential but preferably installed for the stable operation of the FET and higher immunity. According to the FET with such structure, phenomenon of decrease of the potential barrier due to positive holes remaining solely in the substrate can be avoided. Because the positive holes flow through neutral region region being not depleted of the burried p layer 13 to the control electrode 17 and do not remain in the substrate. Thus injection of electrons from the source side into the substrate is suppressed thereby the carrier multiplication is suppressed. Also, when conduction type of each layer is reversed to that of the above description thus conduction type of the source region 12, the active layer 15 and the drain region 16 is made p type and conduction type of the burried layer 13 is made n type and further the control electrode 17 is installed, the soft error can be prevented.Because electrons generated by the d particles flow through the burried n layer 13 to the control electrode 17 and positive holes are prevented from flowing into the layers 12, 15, 16 by the static potential of the burried n layer 13. Summarizing this, according to the element structure of the invention, when the active layer is n type and the burried layer is p type, the carrier multiplication is suppressed and further the total amount of flowing charge can be made less than the charge amount generated by the ct particles. On the contrary, when the active layer is p type and the burried layer is n type, the total amount of flowing charge also can be made less than the charge amount generated by the particles. Thus the element structure of the invention can increase the immunity to particle and prevent the soft error. Embodiments of the invention will now be described. First Embodiment Fig . 3 shows a field effect transistor similar to that of Fig. 2. A burried p layer 33, an active n layer 32 and n layers 35, 36 are formed on a semi insulating GaAs substrate 31 by means of ion implantation and subsequent high temperature annealing. The ion implantation of the burried p layer 33 may be performed using any of Be, Mg, C,Zn, and the implantation energy depends on the forming conditions of the active n layer 32 and the n layers 35, 36 but is usually selected within range of 70 keV 300keV. The dose depends on the implantation energy so as to satisfy condition of being not totally depleated, but is usually selected within range of 1 x 1011 cm 2 or more.The high temperature annealing is usually performed at a temperature of 700oC 850 oC. As a result, carrier concentration of the burried p layer becomes 1 x 1015 cm 3 or more. If the dose is 1 x 1012 cm 2 or more and the high temperature annealing is performed at 700 oC 850 or, the carrier concentration can be made 1 x 1016 cm 3 or more. The burried p layer is formed to thickness of 100 nm or more. A source electrode 39, a drain electrode 40 and a gate electrode 38 are formed by ordinary lift off method. A control electrode 37 of the burried p layer 33 may be made of any metal making ohmic contact with the GaAs layer of p type, such as Cr or AuZn. According to this embodiment, the carrier multiplication generated by o particles can be suppressed. Second Embodiment Fig. 4 shows a second embodiment. This embodiment is provided with p layer 41 of higher concentration than that of the burried p layer 33 formed under the control electrode 37 in the FET with structure shown in Fig. 3. The p layer 41 is made by the high dose ion implantation of any of Mg, Be, C, Zn and the high temperature annealing process or the selective diffusion process of Zn using an insulation film as a mask. In the case of the ion implantation, the implantation energy is usually selected within range of 10 keV 300 keV and the dose is usually selected within range of 1013 cm 2 or more. In the case of the selective diffusion of Zn, the diffusion is performed at a high temperature of 800 oC or more so that the surface concentration is made 1018 cm 3. According to this embodiment, the contact resistance between the control electrode 37 and the burried p layer 33 can be decreased by one figure and the carrier multiplication effect can be further reduced in comparison to the FET with structure shown in Fig. 3. In the FET ofFig. 3, in order to provide the ohmic contact with the burried p layer 33, the control electrode 37 must be made of metal such as Cr or AuZn being other than metal to be used in the source electrode 39 or the drain electrode 40, i.e., metal giving the ohmic resistance with a layer of n type, such as AuGe. In this embodiment, however, since the p layer 41 is at high concentration, even if the control electrode 37 is made of metal with the same sort as that of the source electrode 39 and the drain electrode 40 or of metal with the same sort as that of the gate electrode 38, the ohmic contact can be realized. Consequently, addition of process for forming the control electrode 37 may be omitted and the whole manufacturing process can be simplified. Third Embodiment Fig. 5 shows a third embodiment. In this embodiment, p layer 51 of high concentration is formed adjacent to a source n layer 35, and a source electrode 59 is arranged on the n layer 35 and on the p layer 51 simultaneously. According to this embodiment, the carrier multiplication can be suppressed in similar manner to the first and second embodiments, and further the area of device can be decreased in comparison to these embodiments thereby the high integration can be achieved. In the integrated circuit, the carrier multiplication effect and the soft error during the o particle entering become a problem only at limited elements. If a burried layer is formed, parasitic capacitance will increase.In order that unrequired parasitic capacitance is not produced in the circuit and the circuit speed is maintained, the element structure as shown in Figs. 3 5 may be preferably adopted only at limited elements where the soft error becomes a problem. From this point of view, as shown in Figs. 3 5, the element where the burried p layer 33 is selectively formed at a required portion is preferable to the structure where the burried layer is formed throughout the integrated circuit. Fourth Embodiment Fig. 6 shows a fourth embodiment. In order to maintain the high speed of the integrated circuit as above described, the parasitic capacitance should be eliminated as much as possible. In this embodiment, in order to reduce the parasitic capacitance between a drain n layer 36 and a burried p layer 63, the burried p layer 63 is not formed under the n layer. In order to suppress the carrier multiplication effect and prevent the soft error during the d particle entering, the lowest condition is in that the burried p layer 63 is formed entirely or partially under any one among the n layer 35, the n layer 36 and the active n layer 32. How the burried p layer 63 should be arranged depends on design of the speed of the integrated circuit. Fifth Embodiment Fig. 7 shows a fifth embodiment. An active n layer 52 and n layers 55, 56 are formed on p type GaAs substrate 53 by the ion implantation and the subsequent annealing process. The carrier concentration of the p type substrate 53 is made range of 1015 cm 3 or more so that the substrate is not totally depleted. A source electrode 59, a drain electrode 60 and a gate electrode 58 are formed by ordinary lift off method. A control electrode 57 of the p type substrate 53 may be made of any metal making the ohmic contact with p type GaAs, such as Cr or AuZn or the like. According to this embodiment, the carrier multiplication and the soft error generated by particle can be suppressed in similar manner to the third embodiment.Also, process of forming the burried p layer 33 of Fig. 3 may be omitted and the process can be simplified. When the burried layer being not totally depleted is formed under the active layer, problem of increase of parasitic capacitance occurs. If the parasitic capacitance increases, the circuit speed will decrease. It is therefore important to decrease the parasitic capacitance. Embodiments from this point of view will be hereinafter described. Sixth Embodiment Fig. 8 shows a field effect transistor of a sixth embodiment. A burried p layer 90, an active n layer 82 and n layers 85, 86 are formed on a semi insulating GaAs substrate 81 by the ion implantation and the subsequent high temperature annealing process. The ion implantation of the burried p layer 90 may be performed using any of Be, Mg, C,Zn, and the implantation energy depends on the forming conditions of the n type channel layer 82 and the n layers 85, 86 but is usually selected within range of 70 keV 300 keV to aim the formation close to the channel layer 82. The dose depends on the implantation energy but is usually selected within range of 1 x 1011 cm 2 or more so that the burried p layer 90 is not totally depleted. Focused ion beam is used in the ion implantation for forming the p type layer 90.The beam diameter is about 0.2elm and the finished width of the p type layer 90 becomes about G.25Bm , whereby the capacitance increase due to the burried layer may be neglected. The high temperature annealing is usually performed at a temperature of 700 OC 850 oC. A source electrode 88, a drain electrode 89 and a gate electrode 87 are formed by ordinary lift off method. According to such element structure, decrease of the potential barrier just under the channel layer 82 can be avoided even when positive holes remain in the substrate. According to the element structure, phenomenon of decrease of the potential barrier at the substrate side by the positive holes solely remaining in the substrate can be avoided. Thus injection of electrons from the source side into the substrate is suppressed and the carrier multiplication is prevented. Further, since width of the p type layer 90 is as narrow as 0.25 m or less, increase of capacitance due to the burried layer may be neglected. Seventh Embodiment Fig. 9 shows structure of a ninth embodiment. In this embodiment, a burried p layer 90 is provided with a control electrode 91. Fig. 9 is a view along longitudinal direction of a gate electrode 87 and the burried layer 90 and from side of a sectional surface 93 cutting nearly at the center between the gate electrode 87 and the burried layer 90. A drain electrode and a drain region exist approximately in symmetry of a source electrode 88 and a source region 85 with respect to the gate electrode 87 in similar manner to the sixth embodiment. Forming conditions of source drain region, source drain electrode, the gate electrode 87, the channel 82 and the burried p layer 90 are similar to that of the sixth embodiment. The p layer 92 electrically connects between the burried layer 90 and the control electrode 91, and may be formed by the high dose ion implantation of any of Mg, Be,C, Zn and the active annealing or by the selective diffusion of Zn. Condition of the active annealing is in a temperature of 700 8500C for 15 minutes. The control electrode 91 may be made of Au Mo, Au Zn or Au Cr, and takes the ohmic contact with the p layer 92 by the alloy heat treatment about 400 OC . According to this embodiment, effects similar to that of the sixth embodiment are obtained, and since positive holes generated by d particle under the channel layer 82 can be removed out of the FET through the burried layer 90, the carrier multiplication effect can be further reduced. Eighth Embodiment Fig. 10 shows an element structure of an eighth embodiment. In this embodiment, the gate electrode 87 and the control electrode 91 of the seventh embodiment are overlaid, thereby both are electrically connected. Fig. 10 is a view from similar direction to Fig. 9. This embodiment is similar to the seventh embodiment except for the forming position of the control electrode 91 and the p layer 92. The p layer 92 and the control electrode 91 are formed under the pad of the gate electrode 87. The forming method is similar to that of the seventh embodiment. According to this embodiment, effects similar to that of the seventh embodiment are obtained, and not only width of the depleted layer under the gate electrode but also width of the depleted layer between the burried p layer 90 and the channel layer 82 can be simultaneously varied by the FET control voltage applied to the gate electrode 87, thereby width of the channel layer can be controlled from upper and lower sides. Width of the burried p layer is less than the gate length and therefore the transconductance being two times or more in comparison to the prior art can be obtained. Ninth Embodiment A ninth embodiment will be described referring toFig. 11. In order to only suppress the influence by d particle, concentration in the burried p layer 3 in the structure of Fig. 1 may be made high so that the burried p layer 3 is not totally depleted. However, in this structure structure of high concentration of the burried p layer 3 inFig. 1 so that the layer is not totally depleated , the parasitic capacitance of the element increases and the high speed of the element is inhibited. Consequently, in this embodiment, a burried p layer 117 just under the active layer is made low concentration, and further p type layer 118 of high concentration is arranged at deep portion. If the p type layer 118 of high concentration is conductive, effects of this embodiment are obtained even when the p type layer 117 of low concentration is not conductive totally depleated .Generation of charge by the o particle entering is phenomenon occurring at considerably deep portion in the substrate in comparison to thickness of the active layer 112. We have confirmed that when the p type layer 118 of high concentration is arranged in such deep portion, effect to suppress the influence of d particle scarcely varies. Further, according to this structure, increase of the parasitic capacitance due to arrangement of the p type layers 117, 118 can be made negligibly small. Processes for achieving the structure of Fig. 11 will be described as follows. In this embodiment, a semiinsulating GaAs substrate 111 is used, and all layers of n and p types are formed on the substrate 111 by the ion implantation. First, ions to provide acceptor impurity, such as Be, Mg, Cd, C, are implanted to the semi insulating GaAs substrate once or otherwise several times at the energy variation, thereby the p type layers 117, 118 are formed.The ion implantation of high energy is required for the p type layer of high concentration at deep portion so as to decrease the capacitance, and is usually selected within range of 150 keV 3 MeV. The dose depends on the implantation energy, but is usually selected within range of 101l cm 2 or more. Next, ions to provide donor impurity, such as Si, Se,S, Te, are implanted so as to form the active n layer 112 and the n layer 116. For the n layer 112, the energy and the dose are selected within range of 30 100 keV and within range of 1011 1013 cm 2, respectively. For the n layer 116, the energy and the dose are selected within range of 30 200 keV and within range of 1012 1015 cm 2, respectively.The annealing after the ion implantation is performed at a temperature of 600 900 or for 5 30 minutes.In usual, after all ion implantation is finished, annealing is performed once. However, the annealing of n type may be performed and then the p type implantation annealing may be performed. Or, after the implantation annealing of the p type layer and the active n layer, the gate 114 may be formed and the self alignment implantation annealing of the n layer may be performed. Of course, other various processes may be effected. Next, the ohmic electrode 113 and the gate electrode 114 are formed so as to constitute the FET. Tenth Embodiment Fig. 11 shows structure where the burried p layer 118 is not provided with an electrode. In a tenth embodiment as shown in Fig. 12, a control electrode 129 is added to the structure of Fig. 11 and voltage of a burried p layer 128 can be controlled. This embodiment also is formed by all ion implantation process in similar manner to the ninth embodiment.However, in order to form the p type layer 128 of high concentration at deep portion, the ion implantation of high energy is not used but the ion implantation utilizing the channeling to obtain a deep p type layer is performed. Fig. 13 shows the concept of.a channeling ion implantation device. First, a manipulator 132 is adjusted so that ion beam 134 and crystal axis low index axis such as 4100 , 110 , 111 of GaAs substrate 131 are arranged accurately in parallel to each other. He ion beam is produced by the ion implantation device and applied to theGaAs substrate 131. Then the reflected ions are received by a detector 133, and the incident angle to the GaAs crystal 131 is adjusted using the manipulator 132 so that the reflected ions become minimum. Next, when the same device is used, the ion beam is converted into ions to provide donor impurity to GaAs, such as Si, Se, S, and the ion implantation is still performed.Since the ion beam is entered in parallel to the crystal lattice of the GaAs crystal 131, the incident ions are not liable to the scattering by the crystal lattice and can be entered to deep portion in the crystal at low energy. Other n, n layers and electrodes are formed in similar process to that described in the ninth embodiment, thus the field effect transistor is completed. Eleventh Embodiment In an eleventh embodiment, a transistor is produced using epitaxial growth method or using epitaxial growth method together with ion implantation method. As shown in Fig. 14, on a semi insulating GaAs substrate 141, epitaxial growth of p type GaAs layer 142 of high concentration, p type GaAs layer 143 of low concentration and an An active n layer 144 is performed in this order. The epitaxial growth method may be any of metalorganic chemical vapor deposition MO CVD method, molecular beam epitaxy MBE method, halogen vapor phase epitaxy VPE method and liquid phase epitaxy LPE method.The active layer numeral 2 in Fig. 1 uses the epitaxially growth layer, and after the transistor is formed, mesa etching is performed or the ion implantation of element to make GaAs high resistance, such as 02, Cr, Fe, is performed, thereby element separation is performed. Or, the epitaxial growth is performed only at the p type layers 142, 143, and ion to provide donor impurity, such as Si, Se, S, may be selectively implanted in the p type layer 143 of low concentration so as to form the active layer and the n layers numerals 2, 5, 6 in Fig. 1 . Next, electrodes numerals 8, 9 in Fig. 1 are formed in similar process to that described in the ninth embodiment, thus the field effect transistor is completed. In the description of the above mentioned embodiments, conduction type of the burried layer or the substrate is made p type and conduction type of the active layer is made n type. However, even when the conduction type is reversed, amount of flowing in of carriers during the d particle entering can be made less than the charge generated by the particle. Although the substrate material is limited to GaAs in the description, other compound semiconductor such as InP, GaAlAs, InGaAs, InGaAsP, a ficourse, can suppress the carrier multiplication effect by the element structure of the invention. Because mobility of electron in compound semiconductor is usually larger by one figure than mobility of positive hole thereby positive holes always remain in the substrate. Regarding the substrate of Si, Ge, the carrier multiplication is small in itself and can be suppressed similarly. According to the invention as above described, the carrier multiplication effect during the particle entering can be suppressed thereby the particle immunity can be increased in comparison to the prior art. Thus the short channel effect can be prevented and the soft error can be suppressed.
