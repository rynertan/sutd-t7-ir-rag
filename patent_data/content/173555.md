# Process for making a calcium control system.

## Abstract
Ions are controllably released into solution by novel blends of a hydrocolloid that is one or a combination of guar, oxidized guar, carboxymethyl guar, depolymerized guar, hydroxyalkyl guar, polyvinyl alcohol, carboxymethyl cellulose, xanthan gum, cold water soluble locust bean gum, cold water soluble starch, hydroxyethylated starch, and hydroxypropylated starch, and a calcium, barium, or strontium salt, in which the ratio of salt to hydrocolloid ranges from 10 1 to 1 20, based on total dry weights. They are rnixed with a soluble alginate in relative amounts such that the bivalent cation level is the amount theoretically necessary to convert 16 60 of the sol uble alginate. The mixtures are especially useful in alginate print paste compositions and in preparation of various foods for humans and animals.
