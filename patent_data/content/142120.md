# Method and apparatus for measuring blood constituent counts.

## Abstract
Blood constituents such as red cells, white cells, and platelets are centrifuged into layers in a capillary tube 1 and the true extent of one or more of the layers is measured photometrically. Each layer to be measured is optically scan ned by a sequence of scanning operations with the actual extent of each layer traverse being recorded in a computer 26 . After each layer has been completely circumferentialiy scanned and each traverse recorded, the computer 26 determines the true average axial dimension for each layer and computes, through prior input, the actual constituent count for each constituent layer.
