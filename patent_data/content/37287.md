# Motion transmitting devices and toothed wheels for use therein.

## Abstract
A motion transmitting device, e.g. a torque converter, for transmission of rotary motion makes use of a toothed wheel 7 in which each recess between adjacent teeth 31 is a portion of an ovoid hole. A datum plate 40,50 has ovoid holes 41 equidistantly arranged about a centre 0 eccentric with respect to the wheel. Connector pins 21 engage with rolling motion the holes 41 in the datum plate and the recesses between the teeth, entering into and out of engagement with the wheel as the wheel is driven eccentri cally with respect to the datum plate. The number of pins 21 and holes 41 differs from, preferably by unity, the number of teeth. Of the three integers, wheel, eccentric and datum, one forms the input, one the output and the third is the fixed reference.
