# Document interleaver device.

## Abstract
A device for handling documents which operates to interleave or intermix documents from separate stacks 16, 18 in accordance with a predetermined pattern. The docu ments are fed through the machine preferably so as to be visible and retrievable throughout their travel. The machine includes an inspection station where the documents are overlapped to permit visual inspection of at least one edge portion of each separate document. The documents from separate stacks are fed one by one through separate feed paths A, B with means for insuring single document feed and means for counting prior to merger and discharge of the merged documents.
