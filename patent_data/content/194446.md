# A cooler for human tissue for use during hyperthermia treatment against cancer.

## Abstract
A cooling device is provided for use in cooling surround ing human tissue during hyperthermia treatment of cancer ous tumour. The device comprises at least one tube 8 , wound in a flat coil of closely adjacent turns, constructed of a fluoreresin having continuous pores, such as porous, ex panded poltetrafluoroethylene, and through which flows a coolant. Microwaves used in hyperthermia treatment of cancerous tumours can pass through the device and heat the turmour to be treated while the adjacent noncancerous tissue is cooled by the coolant. Because the tube is porous, the cooling effect is enhanced.
