# Method for protecting the inner surface of a copper alloy condenser tube from corrosion and a copper alloy condenser tube protected thereby.

## Abstract
A thin corrosion protective film of an iron oxide can be formed on the inner surface of a condenser tube made of a copper alloy by first applying on the inner surface a thin layer of an acidic suspension containing iron powder and then exposing the thus coated inner surface to an atmosphere of an oxidising gas. The above method can be carried out in a relatively short period of time and also in a relatively simple fashion. The resultant protective film is uniform and hardly reduces the thermal conductivity of the condenser tube, and is thus ideal as a protective film for condenser tubes of a heat exchanger.
