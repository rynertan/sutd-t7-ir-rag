# Clutch control system.

## Abstract
An electronic control system for a motor vehicle friction clutch and which has an electrical reference signal generator, an engine speed sensor and signal means, and a throttle posi tion sensor which produces a signal indicative of throttle open ing. The throttle signal is combined with the engine speed sig nal to form a modified engine speed signal and a comparator receives the modified engine speed signal and reference sig nal to produce an error signal derived from the two. A clutch position control is operated by the error signal to vary the state of engagement of the clutch to equalise the modified engine speed and reference signals.
