## Description
The present invention relates to a trigger and spring mount mechanism for a firearm and particularly, but not exclusively, to such a mechanism for a semi automatic firearm. Firearms operable manually have included triggers for pulling by the operator which triggers are pivoted about a fixed axis. Rotation of the trigger about such an axis provides for a sufficient force to operate trigger bars, and sears in combination with hammers to initiate and accomplish discharge of the firearms. U.S. Patent No.2342,283 Hyde discloses a trigger mechanism in which a trigger has a finger grip section and a central trigger section having two horizontally aligned lugs projecting from opposite sides therefrom. These lugs seat in bearing surfaces of a trigger casing and a spring element holds the trigger in its seat and biases the trigger towards its at rest position. The movement of the trigger relative to the frame is limited by the engagement of trigger arm sections with the frame. It is an object of the present invention to provide a firearm having a trigger mechanism which obviates or mitigates disadvantages associated with such mechanisms. This is achieved by providing a firearm having a trigger including a bearing cam positioned on the central trigger section of the trigger a recess in the firearm frame for receiving the bearing cam the recess including two substantially planar intersecting surfaces arcuate retaining means adjacent the recess for preventing the bearing cam from moving selected distances from one or more of the two planar surfaces, the arrangement being such that the trigger is pivoted about its bearing cam which cam is movable against the arcuate retaining means and the recess planar surfaces, the trigger being mounted to avoid interference with the barrel and barrel mount of the firearm, the barrel and barrel mount being capable of retracting and lowering. Preferably a spring biasing system is provided so that the trigger and trigger bar are biased to their at rest positions. These and other aspects of the present invention will become apparent from the following description when taken in combination with the accompanying drawings in which In FIGS. 1 3, pistol frame 10 includes right vertical frame section 11, left vertical frame section 12 and horizontal bottom frame section 13. Right frame recess 14 and left frame recess 16 are shaped and spaced apart to serve rotatable bearing cams 21, 22 positioned on trigger 17. Trigger 17 includes finger grip section 18, body portion 19 and right and left bearing cams 21, 22. Trigger 17 also has a trigger extension 23 for pivotable connection with trigger bar 24. Trigger bar 24 rotates about trigger 17 through pin 26. Right frame recess 14 includes a mount bearing upstanding surface 14a and a generally horizontal surface 14b. Likewise, left frame recess 16 has upstanding surface 16a and horizontal surface 16b. Also shown in FIGS. 1 3 are slide stop 27 including slide stop pivot axis 28 and slide latch piece 29. Stop pivot axis 28 is rotatably mounted in frame openings 28a and 28b and serves to confine and control bearing cams 21, 22 movement. Cams 21, 22 are normally biased against surfaces 14a, 14b, 16a, 16b but when forces, such as the operators manipulation of the firearm, cause the trigger 17 to move forward pivot axis 28 limits such movement. Plunger channel 31 in left side frame section 16 carries trigger bar plunger 32 and plunger spring 33 which bear against the trigger bar 24 to urge it into various positions as described below. Turning to FIGS. 2 and 3, barrel 36 including barrel support section 37 are mounted for rotation about barrel pivot 38 through barrel link 39. Turning to FIGS. 6 and 7, slide 41 includes firing pin recess 42 and firing pin 43. Slide return spring 46 and trigger guard 47 are also shown. After the trigger 17 is pulled back to fire causing the pistol to discharge, slide 41 and barrel 36 disengage and the slide then moves rearwardly allowing barrel support section 37 to rotate about pivot 38 as link 39 rotates about slide pivot pin 28 in the direction of arrow A FIG. 7 . Trigger 17 is mounted for rotation does not interfere with the recoil and return of slide 41 and barrel 36. Since cams 21 and 22 are spaced apart providing an opening therebetween FIG. 5 , this construction allows barrel link 39 to lower between trigger cams 21, 22 where normally there is a pivot pin in prior firearms. This arrangement also permits the trigger mechanism to be located farther to the rear of the firearm. Alternatively, a single trigger bearing cam offset to one side could be used provided it was shaped to provide for stable turning of the trigger during firearm operation. Turning to FIGS. 8 13, trigger bar 24 is shown positioned below and urged against slide 41. With the slide 41 forward and trigger 17 forward or back , bar 24 rides in slide recess 51 FIGS. 8 and 9 . With slide 41 back during recoil, bar 24 is lowered as it moves out of recess 51 and is acted upon by slide surface 41a FIG. 10 . Trigger bar 24 is pivotably connected to trigger 17 about pin 26 and is urged rearwardly and upwardly by plunger 32 positioned in tubular frame recess 31 see also FIG. 1 . Plunger 32 is urged rearwardly by coil spring 33 mounted in spring base piece 57 FIG. 11 . Spring base piece 57 includes detent groove 58 which accommodates detent spring 59 to hold base piece 57 in position FIGS. 11 and 12 . Detent spring 59 is held by retaining pin 55 and spring 59 sits in groove 54 of slide pivot pin 28. With particular reference to FIG. 11, it is seen that plunger 32 engages trigger bar 24 to urge bar 24 in a rearwardly and upwardly direction.
