# Low capacitance field effect transistor.

## Abstract
A compact field effect transistor having extremely low source drain to substrate capacitance is disclosed, together with a method of fabricating it. The source 27 and drain 25 regions of the FET are fabricated on an underlying layer of insulating material 12, typically silicon dioxide, while the gate region including a channel 24, is fabricated directly on the semiconductor substrate 10. The source drain 27 25 and gate 24 regions are all simultaneously formed by deposition of a single layer of epitaxial silicon 21. In this manner a monocrystalline silicon gate region 24 is created with polycrystalline silicon source drain regions 27 25. The different rate of growth of silicon dioxide over monocrystalline 24 and polycrystalline silicon 27 25 is utilized to create the gate oxide, while an overlying layer of doped polycrystalline silicon 30 serves as the gate electrode. The source drain regions are typically doped by an impurity diffused from a layer of phosphorous glass deposited between the insulating material and the source drain regions.

## Description
Low CAPACITANCE FIELD EFFECT TRANSISTOR BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention This invention relates to integrated circuits, and in particular, to a compact field effect transistor structure having very low capacitance and a method for fabricating it.Description of the Prior Art Many different types of field effect transistor FET structures and processes for fabricating them are now known. In conventional FET s of the prior art, spaced apart source and drain regions are formed in an underlying semiconductor substrate. A relatively thin layer of silicon dioxide, commonly termed gate oxide, is formed on the surface of the substrate between the source and drain regions.On top of the gate oxide a gate electrode, fabricated from an electrically conductive material, is deposited and defined. The gate electrode will typically be fabricated from metal or doped polycrystalline silicon. In enhancement mode field effect transistors a channel may be implanted or otherwise fabricated between the source and drain regions. Unfortunately, such prior art FET s suffer from a number of disadvantages. Typically such structures have high capacitance between the source and substrate and between the drain and substrate, herein referred to as source drain to substrate capacitance. In addition, such structures have low punch through voltage between the source and drain. Although the source drain to substrate capacitance may be reduced by lowering the impurity concentration of the substrate, lowering the impurity concentration also tends to reduce the punch through voltage. Furthermore, both parameters deteriorate rapidly as the length of an enhancement mode FET channel is reduced below 1 micron because the depletion width of the source and drain regions are of about the same magnitude. The processes by which prior art FET structures are formed also result in undesired consequences, For example, in conventional silicon gate FET fabrication processes a polycrystalline silicon gate electrode is deposited and defined. The gate electrode itself then functions as a mask for the introduction of Impurities to define the source and drain regions. Because these regions tend to diffuse under the edge of the gate, undesired gate source and gate drain capacitances are created through the thin gate oxide. These capacitances have increasingly undesirable effects as increasingly larger memory arrays are fabricated. Furthermore, prior art arrays of silicon gate FET s are difficult to fabricate with uniformly thin layers of insulation beneath the gate electrode. This is in part due to lifting of the edges of the polycrystalline silicon gate as surrounding regions of the silicon substrate are oxidized. The lifting of the gate causes the turn on potential of individual transistors within an array to vary from one to another, thereby degrading perfornence of the array. SUMSbERY OF THE INVENTION A general object of this invention is to provide an improved field effect transistor and a method of making same. In one embodiment a transistor structure fabricated according to the invention comprises a semiconductor substrate, first and second spaced apart regions of insulating material disposed on the substrate and separated from each other by an intervening region of the substrate, a layer of semiconductor material disposed across the first and the second regions and across the intervening region of the semiconductor substrate, a layer of insulating material disposed across the surface of the layer of semiconductor material, and an electrode overlying at least that portion of the layer of insulating material which overlies the intervening semiconductor substrate. In one embodiment a method of fabricating an integrated circuit transistor structure according to the invention comprises forming a first layer of insulating material over first and second spaced apart regions of a semiconductor substrate, the first and second regions being separated by an intervening region of the semiconductor substrate, depositing a layer of selected conductivity type semiconductor material over the layer of insulating material and the intervening region, introducing opposite conductivity type impurity into the layer of semiconductor material overlying the layer of insulating material, forming a second layer of insulating material over the layer of semiconductor material, and fabricating an electrically conductive region over at least that portion of the second layer of insulating material overlying the intervening region.

Figure 7 is a cross sectional view of the structure shown in Figure 6 taken perpendicular to the crosssection shown in Figure 6. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The integrated circuit structure depicted inFigure 1 may be fabricated using known techniques. As shown in Figure 1 on a suitable P conductivity semiconductor substrate 10, for example, doped with 5 x 1016 atoms per cubic centimeter of boron, a layer of silicon di i 12 is formed. In the preferred Thbodiment silicon dioxide layer 12 is approximately 3,000 Angstroms thick and is fabricated by using any well known technique, for example, thermal oxidation. One such technique is to heat substrate 10 in an oxygen atmosphere to a temperature of 10000C for co minutes. After fabrication of silicon dioxide 12, a relatively thin layer of phosphorous pentoxide P205 glass 15 is formed on the upper surface of silicon dioxide 12. In the preferred embodiment the phosphorous glass 15 is 100Angstroms thick and is fabricated by chemical vapor deposition. In such a process phosphine and oxygen are passed over the wafer to create the layer of phosphorous pentoxide on its surface. During subsequent heating, for example, for 30 minutes at IOOOOC, the underlying silicon dioxide 12 will dissolve slightly allowing the upper approximately 1000Angstroms of layer 12 to become doped with phosphorous ions.The resulting structure may then be further processed as described in conjunction with Figures 2 through 7. An alternative structure which may be utilized as a starting point for the process described in conjunction with Figures 2 through 7 is the structure shown in Figure la. As shown in Figure la, substrate 10 and silicon dioxide layer 12 are fabricated in the same manner as discussed in conjunction with Figure 1. On the upper surface of silicon dioxide 12, however, is formed a layer of tantalum 16 approximately 500 Angstroms thick. Tantalum layer 16 may be fabricated by sputtering in a vacuum or by other known processes. On the upper surface of tantalum 16 a relatively thin layer of polycrystalline silicon 17, on the order of 1000 Angstroms thick, is deposited, for example, by chemical vapor deposition. The polycrystalline silicon 17 is then heavily doped with N conductivity type impurities.For example, in the preferred embodiment the doping concentration of layer 1 is 1020 phosphorous atoms per cubic centimeter. This may be achieved by well known diffusion or ion implantation techniques. Another technique for forming the tantalum polycrystalline silicon layers is to use chemical vapor deposition to deposit tantalum 16, deposit polycrystal line silicon 17, and dope silicon layer 17 all in one operation. The structure from either Figure 1 or Figure la is then subjected to further integrated circuit processing operations as described in Figure 2 and subsequent. Figures 2 7 illustrate the subsequent process operations in which the structure of Figure 1 is used. As shown in Figure 2, an opening 20 is made through phosphorous glass 15 and silicon dioxide 12. Opening 20 may be created using known photolithographic integrated circuit fabrication techniques, for example, forming a first mask and etching by chemicals or plasma. According to ene such technique, layers 12 and 15 are removed by plasma etching with carbon tetrafluoride. If the structure shown in Figure la is utilized, then a first mask is formed and the opening through layer 17 is made with carbon tetrachloride plasma. Layers 16 and 12 are then etched using carbon tetrafluoride plasma. As next shown in Figure 3, a layer of epitaxial silicon 21 is deposited across the upper surface of the structure shown in Figure 2. In the preferred embodiment the epitaxial silicon 21 is deposited approximately 5,000Angstroms thick using a low pressure process to prevent the dopant in layer 15 from diffusing into what will become the channel 24 of the transistor structure. In region 24 where the epitaxial silicon 21 contacts the upper surface of substrate 10, monocrystalline silicon will be formed. In regions 27 and 28, however, where epitaxial silicon 21 overlies phosphorous glass 15, polycrystalline silicon will be formed. Region 24 of layer 21 is then doped to an appropriate level, for example, by ion implantation to a concentration of 5 x 1016 atoms per cubic centimeter of boron. The combined structure shown in Figure 3 is then heated to cause the phosphorous from the phosphorous glass 15 to diffuse out into epitaxial layer 21 in regions 27 and 28. In the preferred embodiment this is achieved by heating the structure to a 9000C for 40 minutes. The resulting N resistivity will be 10 ohms per square. Impurity concentra tions between S x 1019 and 1020 atoms per cubic centimeter have been found suitable for the fabrication of regions 27 and 28 in the structure depicted. Because region 24 of epitaxial layer 21 does not overlie phosphorous glass 15, no source of N conductivity type impurities is present for diffusion into region 24.Moreover, because the N conductivity type impurity diffuses in polycrystalline silicon 21 approximately four times faster than in monocrystalline silicon 24, the effective width of region 24 will be only slightly reduced by any lateral diffusion which occurs. The outer lateral boundaries shown in Figure 6 of N doped regions 27 and 28 may be then defined using a second mask and well khown photolithographic techniques. Outside these boundaries epitaxial layer 21 will be removed using well known chemical etching, plasma etching, or other techniques. As shown in Figure 4, a layer of silicon dioxide 25 is next formed on the upper surface of epitaxial layer 21. In the preferred embodiment layer 25 is fabricated by heating the underlying structure in an oxygen atmosphere to a temperature of about 8000C for 4 hours to form about 300Angstroms of silicon dioxide on the upper surface of the P conductivity type portion of epitaxial layer 21 and about 1000 Angstroms of silicon dioxide on the upper surface of the N conductivity type portions of layer 21. The different rate of formation of silicon dioxide on underlying N and P conductivity type doped regions is a known phenomenon which is discussed in further detail in C. P. Ho et al. ThermalOxidation of Heavily Doped Silicon , J. Electrochem. Soc. 125, 665 1978 . A layer of polycrystalline silicon 30 is then formed across the upper surface of silicon dioxide 25.Layer 30 may be deposited as N conductivity type doped polycrystalline silicon or may be deposited as relatively pure polycrystalline silicon which is subsequently doped with an appropriate impurity, for example, arsenic or phosphorous.In the preferred embodiment the impurity concentration of layer 30 is approximately 1020 atoms per cubic centimeter of phosphorous. Undesired portions of layer 30 may then be removed using well known photolithographic and etching techniques to define a gate electrode as shown in Figure 5. As shown in Figures 5 7 the result of the process described is a field effect transistor of the enhancement mode type. The source drain regions, gate oxide, and the oxide surrounding the gate oxide are all self aligned. The process eliminates lifting of the gate electrode. Electrical connections to the source drain regions may be made by suitable openings in silicon dioxide layer 25 at locations not shown in Figures 5 7. In an alternative embodiment in which the structure of Figure la is utilized as a starting structure, the tantalum lines 17 beneath the source drain regions will function as very low resistance electrical connections to the source drain regions. This embodiment is particularly advantageous when the field effect transistor depicted is to be utilized in a semiconductor memory. In such an application the tantalum lines 17 will function as bit or word lines, while other subsequently formed lines will function as word or bit lines, respectively. The transistor structure of Figures 5 7 is particularly advantageous as a field effect transistor because it may be fabricated using relatively few masking steps and has exceptionally low capacitance between the source drain and the substrate. The low capacitance results from the layer of silicon dioxide 12 separating the source drain regions from the substrate 10. In addition, the structure shown is completely self aligned, that is, once the gate region 20 is defined, the source drain regions and thicker oxide surrounding the gate are automatically fabricated on each side of the gate region without masking tolerances. Figure 6 is a top view of the structure shown inFigure 5. For clarity, where boundaries of regions are fabricated aligned, the boundaries have been displaced slightly to display the extent of the depicted regions. For example, the coincident edges of the source drain and channel have been displaced slightly to illustrate the boundaries of these regions. Gate electrode 30 completely overlies channel 24, which separates the source and drain. Because the channel will usually be wider than any contact to the source and drain, the source and drain may be reduced in width away from the channel as shown. Figure 7 shows a cross sectional view of the structure shown in Figures 5 and 6, illustrating the manner in which the gate electrode 30 overlies the channel 24. The gate oxide separates the gate 30 from channel 24, while oxide 12 and glass 15 separate gate 30 from the substrate 10 as shown. Although two embodiments of the process and structure of this invention have been described above, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that numerous variations and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. For example, the conductivity types of the various regions may be changed.
