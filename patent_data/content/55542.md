# Improvements in or relating to the bulk production of alloys by deposition from the vapour phase and apparatus thereof.

## Abstract
A reuseable collector 10 for use in a process for the bulk production of alloy by deposition from the vapour phase. The collector employs a coating of solder alloy 17 on the deposition surface such that after deposition has been completed the solder alloy may be melted and the deposited alloy removed from the collector without the necessity of destroying the collector.
