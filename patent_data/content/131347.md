# APPARATUS FOR UNIFORMLY DISTRIBUTING LIQUID OR FOAM

## Abstract
A closed cylindrical housing is provided with a first cylin drical member secured to the bottom of the housing. A sec ond cylindrical member concentric with, but of lesser diame ter than, the first member passes through a housing cap. The second member terminates in spaced relationship with the bottom of the housing. Liquid or foam supplied to the interior of the housing through the second member rises between the first and second cylindrical members and enters an annular space defined between the first member and the cylindrical housing. A plurality of spaced apertures in the housing com municate with the annular space and serve as outlets for the discharge of liquid or foam.
