## Description
CYANINE AND MEROCYANINE SPECTRAL SENSITIZING DYES This invention is directed to a new group of cyanine and merocyanine spectral sensitizing dyes which can be prepared from 3 indolizine carboxaldehyde, and more specifically to direct positive emulsions sensitized therewith. The prior art describes many dye systems which can be used in the photographic industry to extend the spectral sensitivity of a light sensitive silver halide emulsion, for both negative working and positive working direct positive systems.A light sensitive silver halide emulsion is spectral sensitized when it is rendered more sensitive by addition of dyes which absorb certain portions of the spectrum. Dyes are needed which sensitize direct positive emulsions in the red and orange spectral region for films which are exposed with an orange or red phosphor or laser. Previously know orange and red direct positive dyes are symmetrical carbocyanines and generally give low speed and low contrast. This invention is directed to a new group of spectral sensitizing dyes which can be made from derivatives of 3 indolizine carboxaldehyde, which sensitize direct positive silver halide emulsions to orange and red light and which can serve to provide photographic films which demonstrate high speed and high gradient. According to one feature of the invention there is thus provided a spectral sensitizing dye selected from the group consisting of cyanines having the general formula I EMI2.1 wherein R is H or alkyl of 1 4 carbon atoms R and R are H, alkyl of 1 7 carbon atoms, substituted alkyl, aryl e.g. phenyl or substituted aryl e.g.substituted phenyl and R may be any of the groups represented by R and R and may also be alkenyl of not more than 7 carbon atoms Y is hydrogen, alkyl of 1 4 carbon atoms, NO2 or halogen Q represents sufficient carbon, nitrogen and or sulfur atoms to form a 5 or 6 member heterocyclic or substituted heterocyclic ring and X is an anion and merocyanines having the general formula II.EMI2.2 wherein R is H or alkyl of 1 4 carbon atoms R ,R and Y are as defined above and Q represents sufficient carbon, nitrogen and or sulfur atoms to form a 5 or 6 member heterocyclic or substituted heterocyclic ring. When Q in formula I or formula II forms a substituted heterocyclic ring, the substituents may be such as to form a fused ring system. According to a further feature of the present invention, there is provided a light sensitive silver halide emulsion which contains an effective amount of a spectral sensitizing dye according to the invention as hereinbefore defined. According to a still further feature of the present invention, there is provided a direct positive photographic film comprising a support, a fogged gelatino silver halide emulsion on said support, and optionally one or more auxiliary layers, characterized in that the emulsion contains an effective amount of a spectral sensitizing dye according to the invention as hereinbefore defined. The dyes according to the invention are usually made up as dilute alcohol solution and are added to a gelatino silver halide emulsion in amounts ranging from 0.01 g to 1.2 g per 1.5 moles of silver halide. Where any of R , R and R1 represents substituted aryl, e.g. substituted phenyl, the substituent may for example be alkoxy e.g. methoxy or nitro.R preferably represents methyl, phenyl, p methoxyphenyl or p nitrophenyl. R preferably represents hydrogen. R1 preferably represents alkyl or alkenyl containing up to 4 carbon atoms, e.g. methyl or 2 propenyl.The anion is preferably 4 methylbenzenesulfonate or tetraphenylborate. Typical positive working. gelatino silver halide emulsions useful in the practice of this invention are legion in number and description. It is preferred to use silver bromoiodide prepared from a balanced. double jet type precipitation about 0.2 IL edge length containing about exlO 5 mole percent rhodium in about 190g gelatin per mole of silver halide. These emulsions are fogged with cesium thiadecaborane and hydrochloroauric acid and contain sensitizing adjuvants such as polyethylene oxides. The emulsion can be coated at about 0.4 3 g Ag m2 coating weight on a paper or a polyester base having an antihalation backing layer.and the emulsion hardened with formaldehyde. Some typical dye structures representative of the dyes of this invention include EMI4.1 EMI5.1 EMI6.1 As stated above. these emulsions may be coated on a polyester or paper support, but it is preferable to use 0.004 inch O . lrnm thick polyethylene terephthalate film coated on both sides with the subbing layer of Rawlins. U.S. Pat. No. 3,443,950 vinylidene chloride alkyl acrylate itaconic acid copolymer mixed with an alkyl acrylate and or methacrylate polymer overcoated with a thin substratum of gelatin. A conventional antihalation layer is preferably applied on one side and the sensitized. fogged emulsion of this invention on the opposite side of the film support.After drying, film strip samples of the resulting photographic film can be tested by a 10 3 second exposure through a g step wedge on the Mark 6 Sensitometer made byE. G. And G. Co. which uses the GE type FT 118 XenonFlash Tube. After exposure, the strips may be developed in any conventional developer e.g., mixed hydroquinone phenidone developing agent .One preferred developer contains the following ingredients Ingredient Amt. g l Sodium Metaborate 19.8 Sodium Sulfite 244.4 Sodium Carbonate 35.7 Sodium Hydroxide 45 soln. 151.9 5 Nitrobenzimidazole 0.09 Benzotriazole 0.92 l Phenyl 5 Mercaptobenzo 0.10 triazole Hydroquinone 111.0 Phenidone 5.95 Potassium Bromide 5.35 pH 11.6 12.0Additional wetting agents, sequestrants. and adjuvants may also be incorporated in the developer, as known to those skilled in the art.Typically. the exposed strips are developed for about 30 seconds in the above developer at 950F 35 C followed by a 50 second water wash, and fixed for 30 seconds in a conventional ammonium thiosulfate fixer at a pH of about 5.4 and a temperature of 950F 350C . The fixed element is then washed 30 seconds in water and dried. In addition, the dyes of this invention can be used as a dye pair to supersensitize a direct positive emulsion, especially when combined with the dyes of U.S. 4.355.098. Supersensitization usually results in speed and spectral extension of the emulsion beyond that which might be predicted from a simple arithmetic addition of the individual effects produced by each dye alone. Supersensitization is an old phenomenon in the negative working silver halide industry. A good review of this subject is found for example, in Gilman et al. J. Photogr. Sci. Vol.21. pages 53 70 1973 . Supersensitization of direct positive emulsions using dye pairs is also known in the prior art.
