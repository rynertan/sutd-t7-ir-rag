## Description
Compositions having antimicrobial activityThis invention relates to compositions endowed with antimicrobial activity.The compositions of the invention are characte rized in that they contain, as active principles, N haloamidine of formula 1 EMI1.1 wherein X is a chlorine or a iodine atom.Compounds of formula 1 , per se known, and their preparation methods, are described in 1 P. Robin, C.R.Acad.Sci., Paris, 177, 1304 1923 2 L. Citerio, D. Pocar, R. Stradi, B.Gioia, J. Chem. Soc. Perkin I, 1978, 509.In Table 1 the formula of the object compounds, the corresponding abbreviations used in their biological screening, the molecolar weight, the melting point and the method used particularly for their preparation are shown.EMI1.2 TABLE 1EMI2.1 tb ompounds SEP Structural SEP M.P.

Ehrhard and H. Ruschig, Arzneimittel, Vol.4, pages 20 and following, Verlag Chemie, 1972 . Such an activity, mainly due to the features of the nitrogen halogen bond, yet derives also from the nature of the residual part of the compound. Nevertheless, the already known compounds, besides having sometimes weak activity, are often unstable and this limits the possibilities of practical use.It has now been found that the compounds of formu la 1 are endowed with marked antimicrobial activity and that, surprisingly, such an activity is considerably higher than that of active compounds con taining N halogen bonds, up to now used for this purpose.As it will be evident from the data hereinafter reported, the compounds of the invention have par tially an antimicrobial activity higher than that of the known antimicrobial agent chlorhexidine N,N bis 4 chlorophenyl 3,12 diimino 2,4,11,13 tetraazatetradecandiimidamide .It is particularly interesting the activity of compounds AB and AB 6 against strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and indole positive Proteus, usually the most drug resistant species.The activity against these strains, has been clearly higher than chlorhexidine s one.The bactericide activity appears at the concentration of 100 p.p.m. in different way. on single strains, the bactericide activity appearing at different contact times.It is to stress the particular action of compound 6 on Pseudomonas and indole positive Proteus within 3 minutes 100 activity and the action of compounds AB5 on the same strains within 60120 minutes.The chlorhexidine, at the minimum bactericide con centration of 200 p.p.m., has proved to be less active. The serum has an inhibitory action on the activity Tab. 4 .In conclusion, the main antibacterial interest of the investigated compounds of the invention is oriented on strains particularly resistant to drugs and disinfectant agents Pseudomonas aeruginosa and indole positive Proteus .Taking into account the activities characterizing the cited compounds, the invention refers also to the use of the compounds of general formula 1 as antimicrobial agents. According to the invention, the meaning of use includes all the operations concerning the preparations of compounds of formula 1 , their purification, their formulation in forms suitable for their employment and or for their making up in containers suitable for the employment to which they are designed.For the practical use, the compounds of the present invention, corresponding to the formula 1 , are appropriately transformed in suitable forms for the application to the areas and to the objects to be disinfected such as solutions, emul sions, suspensions, sprays, compositions in form of paste or powder.For the preparation of such forms, the compounds of the invention are mixed up with suitable solvents, diluents or inert excipients.The results of the studies which have allowed to evidence the activity of the claimed compo unds are hereinafter reported.Materials and methodsBacterial culturesDifferent bacterial species isolated from patients are employed. When more strains of the same microorganism were used, these showed dif ferent antibiogram spectrum. Strains of E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, indole positive and negative Proteus, Staphilococcus aureus, Enterobacter, Salmonella sp.,Serratia marcescens, B. subtilis and Bacillaceas are investigated.Compounds AB and AB 6 are dissolved in ethanol ethyl alcohol 950, C. Erba and all the subsequent dilutions performed in distilled water.The chlorhexidine is diluted from the commercial product already dissolved in distilled water.Determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration MIC The broth dilution is employed to assess MIC values for all strains. Sterile microtiter plates with U bottom with 96 wells are employed.0.1 M1 of liquid medium tryptose Roche broth are put in each well, the plates are kept at 200 and, before use, at room temperature.The disinfectant agent is put in the wells of the row 2 at a concentration of 4000 mcg ml real 2000 mcg ml and then with a 100 micropipette dilutions are performed from row 2 to row 11.The row 1 is the control of the medium and the row 12 is the control for the fertility of the medium itself.After having performed the dilutions, 0.01 ml of a 24 hrs bacterial broth culture previously diluted at 10 4 for Gram negative strains and 10 for Gram positive ones are placed in all wells, from the rows 2 to 12.After the inoculation, the plate is hermetical ly sealed with adhesive transparent band and an hole is done with a needle.The plates are kept at 350 for 24 hours and a macroscopic reading is carried out in case of non uniform reading, taking place only for chlorhexidine, the cultures from the wells are plated on agar heart brain medium Sclavo through Dinatech apparatus head Inoculum 96 and the reading of the growth is carried out in the following 24 hours. Bactericide activityIt is assessed through Dinatech apparatus with Inoculum 96 head.Chemical compounds at established concentra tions are placed in amount of 1 ml in the con tainers, the bacterial inoculum is then added in amount of 0.1 ml 24 hrs culture and at pre established times 3,5,10,30,60 and 120 mi nutes , through the head, the mixture compound disinfectant agent is transferred in solid medium agar heart brain medium . After incubation at 350C for 24 hours, the reading is carried out. The tests are repeated in presence of human serum at the concentration of 10 . ResultsThe evaluation of the MIC, reported in Table 2, shows an higher value for chemical compoundsAB5 and B6 for Proteus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa straine.Such an activity is higher than that showed by chlorhexidine.Also the other compounds have higher antimicro bial activity for Staphilococcus aureus andBacillaceae in comparison with Gram negative strains.The bactericide activity on the strains is reported in Table 3. The reported concentration of 100 p.p.m. for each chemical compound is the minimum one which proved to be active in preliminar tests, concentrations of 10 and 1 p.p.m. proved to be in fact inactive. For chlorhexidine, the minimum active concentration is 200 p.p.m.From the reported data on different strains, it comes out for E. coli total bactericide activity developing within 3 minutes for compound AB5 activity noticed within 30 120 minutes for chlorhexidine. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa and indole positive Proteus the total bactericide activity is within 3 minutes for compound AB6, from 60 to 120 minutes for the chlorhexidine.Both chemical compounds show activity on Staph.aureus, B. subtilis, Serratia marcescens andSalmonella sp. Chemical compound AB6 is the most active the longest time in which it is active is 30 minu tes for Serratia marcescens.

At last, the irritability characteristics have been examined and can be summarized for both compounds as follows Cutaneous irritability Patch test The product, applied in powder 0.5 g on the intact or scarified rabbit s skin, did not cause any irritative effect.Ocular irritability Draize test The product, instilled as 5 suspension in the rab bits conjunctival sac 0.1 ml , causes a slight ocular irritation only of the conjunctiva vasal hyperhemia without damages of cornea and iris.The clinical picture regresses in the following 2448 hours. The irritative phenomenon is inhibited by the water wash of the eye immediately after the instillation of the product.
