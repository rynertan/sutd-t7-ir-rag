# INTEGRATED PRESSURE SENSOR

## Abstract
In an integrated pressure sensor, a silicon chip 10 for pressure detection and a substrate 22 for supporting the silicon chip are made of the same material, the silicon chip 10 has a thin diaphragm portion 14 and a peripheral fixed portion 12 thicker than the diaphragm portion 14 , and the silicon chip 10 is bonded to the substrate 22 through a thin insulating film 20 .
