For high sensitivity detection of amino acids, methods ³²S PITC labelling of ¹³⁵I PITC labelling are disclosed in 1 W.G. Lauer, Fundamental Techniques in Virology, Eds. K. Habel and N.P. Salgman p.379 1969 Academic Press N.Y., and 2 C.J. Burrell, P.D. Cooper, J.M. Swann, Aust J. Chem. It is an aim of the present invention to provide a method for detecting amino acid derivatives in which the above mentioned problems are obviated or reduced. Accordingly, this invention provides a method for detecting amino acid derivative, which method is characterised by reacting 5 thiazolinone amino acid derivatives of the general formula a below with an amino compound which is of the general formula b below and which is labelled with a radioactive iodine isotope or which is a fluorescent amino compound, to form phenylthiocarbamyl amino acid derivatives of the general formula c below, and detecting the phenylthiocarbamylamino acid derivatives Preferably, the 5 thiazolinone amino acid derivatives are obtained by reacting phenyl isothiocyanate of the general formula d below with a protein or a peptide of the general formula e below to form phenylthiocarbamylprotein of the general formula f below, and reacting the phenylthiocarbamylprotein with an acid in an anhydrous condition according to the formula III below to effect cyclization and scission In the above general formulae the symbols R₁, R₂ and R₃ represent known chemical parts, groups or radicals, for example, amino acid side chains, e.g. hydrogen or hydrocarbon radicals, which will readily be appreciated and known by those skilled in the art. The said symbols can thus represent any known and appropriate chemical parts, groups or radicals and such chemical parts, groups or radicals are specifically included herein. The method of the invention may enable the amino acid derivatives to be detected with a high degree of sensitivity. Also, smaller amounts of specimens may be used as compared with the amounts of specimens used in known methods. Thus, the method of the invention is of considerable industrial importance and value. The amino compound of the general formula b may be a radio active iodine isotope labelled iodohistamine. Alternatively, the amino compound of the general formula b may be a fluoroescent amino compound in the form of aminopyrene or aminofluorene. Preferably, the phenylthiocarbamylamino acid derivatives are detected by using a gamma ray detector or a fluorescence spectrophotometer. The present invention also provides a method for detecting amino acids or amino acid derivatives, which method is characterised by reacting thiazoline derivatives with an amino compound to form phenylthiocarbamylamino acid derivatives, and detecting the phenyl thiocarbamylamino acid derivatives, the amino compound being a radioactive isotope labelled or isotope containing amino compound or a fluorescent amino compound. The invention will now be further illustrated, merely by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which In order to facilitate a full and complete understanding of the present invention, reference will also be made to the following Examples. This Example demonstrates a basic detection method wherein 5 thiazolinone derivatives of amino acids hereinafter abbreviated to ATZ were reacted with a radioactive iodine isotope labelled iodohistamine to form phenylthiocarbamylamino acid derivatives, and these phenylthiocarbamylamino acid derivatives were detected with a high level of sensitivity. In the basic detection method a dipeptide hereinafter abbreviated as Leu Ala consisting of leucine hereinafter abbreviated as Leu and alanine hereinafter abbreviated as Ala is used instead of a protein for simplicity. The basic detection method is described in the following order Leu Ala 202 mg was dissolved in 50 aqueous pyridine, and the pH was adjusted to 8.6 by the addition of 2N sodium hydroxide NaOH . Subsequently, phenylisothiocyanate was added thereto. The pH was kept at 8.6 by the addition of 2N sodium hydroxide because it was decreasing with the addition of the phenylisothio cyanate. After the variation in the pH had been decreased, the solution was heated at 40 C for one hour. After the reaction, the reaction solution was washed with benzene. After the benzene dissolved in the water phase had been purged with nitrogen N₂ gas, the pH was adjusted to 2 by the addition of 1N hydrochloric acid HCR , whereupon PITC Leu Ala was obtained in the form of a white precipitate. Yield 270 mg, yield 80 , melting point 148 C. The above PITC Leu Ala 100 mg was dissolved in TFA 1 ml , and the solution was heated at 50 C for 5 minutes. After the reaction, the solution was completely evaporated to dryness. Butyl chloride was added to the residue to thoroughly dissolve the product in it, and the resulting solution was passed through a cellulose column Ala was adsorbed on the column . The effluent was collected and evaporated to dryness. ATZ Leu was obtained in the form of a white solid. Yield 70 mg, yield 95 As the above reaction formula shows, the amino group of I. histamine attacks the carbonyl group of ATZ amino acid to give a product. The reaction is the reverse of a reaction for cleaving the peptide bond between phenylisothiocyanate and the peptide. In the above reaction formula, Ø and R are any known and suitable chemical parts, groups or radicals. Ø and R, for example, may be amino acid side chains, e.g. hydrogen or hydrocarbon radicals, or Ø may be the phenyl radical. ATZ Leu 70 mg obtained from PITC Leu Ala was dissolved in 30 pyridine dimethylformamide 20 ml , to which was then added I. histamine 2HC1 200mg . The resulting mixture was heated with agitation at 50 C for one hour. The reaction solution was evaporated to dryness and the residue was dried to solid form and extracted with 1N sodium bicarbonate and ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate phase was dried and evaporated to dryness. The residue was recrystallized from benzene to obtain a product in the form of a white crystal. Yield 120 mg, yield 83 . There was good agreement between the result of elementary analysis of this product and the values calculated from its theoretical formula. Each of the reaction mixture and the reaction product was passed through a high pressure liquid chromatography column and the detection was made by ultraviolet fluorescence spectra at 269 nm . The results are shown in Figure 3. Figure 3 i shows a high pressure liquid chromatography chart just after mixing. Figure 3 ii shows a high pressure liquid chromatography chart after heating at 50 C for 30 minutes. Figure 3 iii shows a high pressure liquid chromatography chart after heating at 50 C for one hour. As these Figures clearly show, the coupling reaction between the thiazolinone derivative of leucine and iodohistamine was completed by heating at 50 C for one hour, so that the thiazolinone derivative was detected in the form of a phenylthiocarbamylleucine derivative. This Example demonstrates how a method similar to that described in Example 1 was applied to various dipeptides and a pentapeptide, and the detection was performed by using thin layer chromatography and an X ray film. The dipeptides and heptapeptide used were as follows Leu Gly, Pro Phe, Phe Ala, Met Leu, Ser Phe, Ile Ser, Gly Glu, Ala Ala, Val Glu, Gln Gly and Tyr Gly Gly Phe Leu. A similar method to that described in Example 1 was followed. Thus, each of the above peptides was reacted with phenylisothiocyanate to form a phenylthiopeptide, which was converted into a thiazolinone derivative by cyclization and scission by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid. The thiazolinone derivative was reacted with iodohistamine partially labelled with a radioactive isotope to form a phenylthiocarbamylamino acid derivative. A variety of the formed phenylthiocarbamylamino acid derivatives were passed through a thin layer chromatographic column and then detected as clear exposed spots on an X ray film after exposure for day and night. In the thin layer chromatography, a solvent system comprising benzene, methanol and tert butyl alcohol in a volume ratio of 8 1 1 was used in development. The results are shown in Figure 4, wherein ordinates represent radio frequency RF values. As compared with the sensitivity of detection in the prior art, the level of sensitivity of the present invention was extremely high as follows In this Example, no radioactive substance is used in the main reaction. It is used only in the final step in the sequence determination method, so that the main reaction is quite the same as in the prior art. A radioactive substance is used in a special vessel in only the final modification reaction of a reaction product intermediate ATZ in each step and therefore the reaction itself does not differ at all from that in the prior art. Therefore, it is possible to perform the reaction without adversely affecting the reaction yield, while minimizing radioactive contamination This Example demonstrates how 5 thiazolinone derivatives of amino acids were reacted with a fluorescent amino compound 9 aminofluorene to form phenylthiocarbamylamino acid derivatives, and the products were detected with high sensitivity. A similar procedure to that described in Example 1 was followed until the step of obtaining thiazolinone derivatives. The thiazolinone derivative of leucine hereinafter abbreviated as ATZ Leu was used. This reaction proceeded according to the following reaction formula to form a phenylthiocarbamylamino acid derivative. In the above reaction formula, R is any known and suitable chemical part, group or radical. R, for example, may be an amino acid side chain, e.g. a hydrogen or hydrocarbon radical. The reaction was performed in the following way. To ATZ Leu 70 mg, 0.21 mM was added 9 aminofluorene 130 mg, 0.6 mM dissolved in 30 pyridine dimethyl formamide, and the resulting mixture was reacted by heating at 50 C for one hour. After the reaction, the reaction solution was evaporated to dryness. Chloroform CHCl₃ was added to the residue and the insoluble matter 9 aminofluorene HCl was separated by filtration. The chloroform phase was washed with 0.1 N HCl and 0.11 N NaHCO₃, over Na₂SO₄ and concentrated to dryness. The residue was recrystallized from benzene to obtain a product in the form of a white crystal. Yield 130 mg, yield 88 , melting point 225 C. Each of the reaction mixture and the reaction product was passed through a high pressure liquid chromatography column, and the detection was performed by ultraviolet fluorescence spectra at 269 nm . The results are shown in Figure 5 with Figure 5 i showing a high pressure liquid chromatography chart of the reaction mixture just after mixing, and Figure 5 ii shows a high pressure liquid chromatography chart after reacting by heating at 50 C for one hour. As these Figures 5 i and 5 ii clearly show, a thiazolinone derivative a of leucine after the reaction was detected in the form of a phenylthiocarbamylleucine derivative c . In addition, comparison between the sensitivity of detection in this invention and that in the prior art phenylthiohydantoinamino acid detection method revealed that the sensitivity of detection in this invention was extremely high as follows In accordance with this invention, extremely high sensitivity of detection of the amino acid derivatives is shown below by comparison with the sensitivity of detection in the prior art method in which a phenylthiocarbamylamino acid derivative is used It will be appreciated from the above Figures and Examples, that this invention resides in reacting an iodine labelled or a fluorescent amino compound with a thiazolinone derivative of an amino acid to form a phenylthiocarbamyl derivative and detecting it with a high degree of sensitivity. Although the above Examples only use iodohistamine or aminofluorene, it is to be understood that other iodine labelled or fluorescent amino compounds can be used, and that this invention is not to be limited to the particular chemicals or compounds used in the Examples.
