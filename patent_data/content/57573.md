# Multistage thermostat.

## Abstract
A multistage thermostat includes multistage cycler means 36 comprising a primary cycler 102 which controls a pri mary heating stage heat pump and a plurality of cyclers 103 104 which control respective stages of the secondary heat electric heat . The setpoint means Tsp is driven by a clock 11 and night setback and day setup means 12. The setpoint means and a temperature sensor Ts are differenced to form a signal for controlling the multistage cycler. The error signal is fed through a proportional constant means 81 and an integra tor means 71 in parallel to control the multistage cycler means. To prevent the primary heating stage going off at setback when the temperature is low, and prevent secondary heating stages coming on on setup when the primary heating means can handle the load, a comparator unit 25 detects any sud den change in the setpoint and re initiates or resets the inte grator to a new stored value.
