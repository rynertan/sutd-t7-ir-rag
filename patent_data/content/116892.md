# Tamper evident closures and packages.

## Abstract
A tamper evident closure and package having a contain er 10 , a resealable, substantially rigid closure 12 for closing, opening and reclosing the container 10 , color changing means 32a in Figures 1 6 which effect a color change upon stretching, and coacting mechanical means 24, 36, 44 and 46 in Figures 1 6 for uncapping and recapping the closure 10 and for stretching the color changing means 32a which clearly and unequivocally indicate the condition of the package, e.g., open or closed. Where legends, or other well defined indicia, indicating opening is desired, the color changes can be localized in the skirt by providing thin sections 32a which stretch preferen tially and adjacent thicker sections 38 which remain substantially unstretched. The thin sections 32a for exam ple can be a legend, or alternatively the thick sections 38 can be the legend while the thin sections 32a provide a suitable background. The colour changes employed by the invention can be accomplished by such phenomena as stress whitening inherent in various plastic materials. Alternatively, the color changes can be accomplished by mechanisms such as the use of encapsulated staining or coloring agents incorporated in a suitable matrix.
