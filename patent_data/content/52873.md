# PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF BODIES MOLDED FROM CARDBOARD OF THE CORRUGATED TYPE CONTAINING SYNTHETIC FIBRES

## Abstract
Formed bodies are obtained by thermoforming corru gated cardboard containing at least 30 by weight of thermoplastic fibrils of high specific surface area, the forming operations consisting in a heating of the cardboard at temperatures equal to or greater than the melt temperature of the fibrils b introducing the cardboard thus heated into a press or forming mold, and c allowing the cardboard thus heated to cool down in said press or mold at a temperature below the melt temperature of the fibrils. c cooling of the cardboard to a temperature below that of the fibril forming polymer. 2 Process according to claim 1, characterized in that heating operation a is carried out at a temperature greater by 25 C than the melt temperature of the fibril forming polymer. 3 Process according to claims 1 and 2, characterized in that the fibril forming polymer is an olefinic polymer. 4 Manufactured products based on corrugated cardboard obtained through the process according to claims from 1 to 3.
