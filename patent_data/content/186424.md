# ACRYLOFUNCTIONAL SILICONES

## Abstract
New acrylofunctional silicones and a method for their synthesis are disclosed. The acrylofunctional silicones are the product of reacting aminoalkyl or diaminoalkyl silicones with isocyanatoacrylates. The acrylofunctional silicones are useful coating materials, and can be cured by ultraviolet radiation.
