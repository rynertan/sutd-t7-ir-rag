# Process for preparing alpha arylalkanoic acids.

## Abstract
Rearrangement of alpha halo alkylarylketals in neutral or weakly alkaline conditions and in the presence of a polar protic medium and subsequent hydrolysis of the thus obtained esters, in the same reaction medium, to afford the corresponding alpha arylalkanoic acids or their salts which are particularly useful as anti inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic agents.
