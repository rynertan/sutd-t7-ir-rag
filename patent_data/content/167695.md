## Description
A DEVICE OF POTAELt DUSTED FOR SOFT PRECISEThe present invention concerns a device for dusting objects and rooms with softness and precision, cc n prising a rotable duster operated by an electric mo tor incorporated in the handle of said device.It is already well known that the devices used to take away atmospheric dust from objects, furniture pieces, surfaces and similar always consisted in feather dusters out of animal or vegetal materials.Furthermore, to meet particular requests of deeper cleaning, vacuum cleaners of various kinds have re cently been realized, provided with a motor which determines a depression at one end of the suction it pipe, and with a dust container.All said devices, however, have prooved to be ina dequate to dust very light and small objects, even tually placed into exhibitors, like medicine boxes, small fancy articles and trikets placed In glass show cases and similar, which even if requesting continuous care would thereby be removed, upset and also ruined by the too hard and heavy contact with the knovn devices.It is the aim of the present invention to realize a device which will eliminate all above mentioned inconveniences. The present invention, as it is characterized in the attached claims, solves the problem of soft ness taking away the dust placed on any kind 6f light object and also in places difficult to reach like corners, of various kinds. By using a device of this kind the following advantages are obtain ed objects placed on any surface can be dusted without removing the same, places difficult to reach like glass show cases can be freed from the dust, inner parts of the vehicles up to the most hidden parts for traditional craning will be dusted.This aim will be reached by the device according to the present invention, comprising a handle which eventually may be of anathomic conformation containing an electric motor operated by means of a feeding cable by the network and or by pri mary and or rechargeable, incorporated batteries, so as to determine, with an eventual interposi tion of a speed reducer, the rotation of an axis on which a cylindrical supporting element is in serted by pressure or in any other way, and on the other end the duster for the elimination of the dust, and in this way the duster will be put into rotation. The present invention will be described more in detail according to the attached drawings, show ing some preferred embodiments.Figure 1 shors in a perspective view the device according to the present invention, wherein the inner components are shown in transparency.Figure 2 shows a lateral section of a further em bodiment of said device, provided with recharge able batteries.Figure 3 shows a long section of another embody ment of said device with a rotable axis being non coaxial with the cylindrical element carry ing the duster.Figures 4 and 5 show long sections of respective ly, an embodiment provided with a dust aspiratDr and a further embodiment provided with an eventual ly removeable parabola lamp for the concentration of the light beam.The figures show a device for soft, precision dust ing, mainly comprising a handle 1, eventually with an anathomic conformation, containing an electric motor 2 operated by network current through cable 3 and or by electric batteries 4, so as to deter mine, with the eventual interposition of a speed reducer, the rotation of axis 6 projecting from the front end, and of cylindrical element 7 hollow or solid , inserted by pressure on the end of said axis 6 and liably carrying at the end thereof duster 8.According to the present invention said handle 1 is provided with a switch 5 with stable or labi le position, of the pushbutton kind, or of both, and ends up with rotating axis 6, keyed on the electric motor 2 axis.In a different embodiment according to figure 3, the axis projecting from the motor may operate, by means of interposition of transmission ele ment 12, non coaxial axis 6 carrying cylindri cal element 7 and duster 8.In a further embodiment, cylindrical element 7 may be connected to the end of axis 6 by screw, joint, bayonet or in any other known way.Said duster 8 may be realized in different forms and dimensions and with different components, ac cording to the requests, with feathers, delicate texile or syinthetic fibres, also mi ed, or in any case assembled in the most adequate form. In the embodiment according to figure 4, the devi ce according to the present invention proves able to perform, beyond the operation already describe ed, also and contemporarily a function of aspira tor of the dust removed by duster 8 through hollow cylindrical element 7, due to the presence of a fan or similar, housed in the handle 1 body, with an incorporated or outer dust container.A further selection of the inventions functions may request the insertion, at the end of handle sideways or in any proper position, of a small lamp 10 with an adequate parabola 11 for the con centration of the light beam which may assist the operator in the control of the operation of said device, where there should be lack of light.An eventual, further variant of the present inven tion of greater dimensions than all precedent will be provided with a jack for the connection with the electric circuit of a vehicle, so as to provide far the reoving of the dust in vehicles with a consequent long lasting autonomy in working.It is provided that the device handle motor batte ry may comprise a series of cylindrical elements 7 with dusters 8 of different kinds, which can be interchangeable and inserted at free choice onto motor axis 6. In this case the device will be placed, separated from the various cylindrical elements, and toge ther with the duster, into an appropriate contain er. In another solution, the handle will be provided with and end eye 13 for hanging it up on an appro priate place.It should be noted that cylindrical element 7, whizz on one side is connected to motor axis 6 and on the other side carries duster 8, may be, independently from the solid or hollow realization thereof, ac cording to its unction, rigid or flexible the ri gidity allows a major power in eliminating the dust while the flexibility which obviously induces a working at a lower angular speed permits a grea ter sensibility in working, which is the aim of the present invention. It is possible to provide on the same motor axis a series of dusters of different dimensions and with cylindrical elements of different rigidity so as to cover the different requests of use.The main feature of the functioning of the object according to the present invention os the one of replacing a manual alternative or partially rotat ing alternative movement, produced by a rotation of the wrist, of an already well known means, by a rotation movement, with the help of an eventual aspiration and deposit of the removed dust, which movement is always manually directed to that area requesting the elimination of the dust, but which performs the necessary work independently just re questing the manual intervention in the shifting of the device. The result is a precise operation, manually di rected, and with an extreme sensibility towards the object the softness and the variety of the whole is out of doubt and well experienced, toge ther with the variants in length and in flexibi lity and composition of the group carrying the duster.
