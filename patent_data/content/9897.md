# Processes for the preparation of gels, products obtained thereby, and their use.

## Abstract
Edible alginate and low methoxy pectate gels are pro duced by rapidly mixing aqueous slurries containing finely divided foodstuff and particles of sparingly soluble solid, e.g. calcium sulphate, capable of releasing gelling agent into solution, throughout gellable aqueous alginate or low methoxy pectate sols, and then under shear free con ditions allowing the solid to release the gelling agent. e.g. calcium ions so that the mixture can gel.
