# DC switching voltage regulator with extended input voltage capability.

## Abstract
A direct current high voltage switching voltage regulator for generating a controlled low voltage, low current output referenced to the positive side of a variable voltage input voltage is provided while maintaining operation over an extended voltage input range with low power loss and heat dissipation and consequent high efficiency.
