# Photographic silver halide element containing an antistain agent or antistain agent precursor.

## Abstract
A stain retarding concentration of a phosphine anti stain agent or phosphine antistain agent precursor in the undercoat layer of a photographic silver halide element comprising a support having thereon a a photographic silver halide gelatino emulsion layer, and b an undercoat layer between the emulsion layer and the support, provides reduced stain in the element upon exposure and process ing. The photographic element can contain a silver halide developing agent. The photographic element, after expo sure, can be processed by means of an aqueous alkaline activator bath and then an aqueous thiosulfate stabilizer bath.
