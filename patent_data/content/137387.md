## Description
The present invention relates to a plasmid, microorganisms containing this plasmid and a process for producing L phenylalanine by fermentation. Various prior art methods for producing L phenylalanine by fermentation are known. For example, a method has been reported which comprises artificially inducing mutation from a wild strain to thereby impart L phenylalanine productivity to the strain since the wild strain does not produce L phenylalanine. Examples of mutants having L phenylalanine productivity that have been hitherto known include mutants of the genus Brevibacterium and the genus Corynebacterium resistant to phenylalanine antagonists U.S. Patent 3,660,235 , mutants of the genus Corynebacterium requiring tyrosine for growth and resistant to phenylalanine antagonists U.S. Patent 3,759,790 , mutants of the genus Brevibacterium and the genus Corynebacterium resistant to phenylalanine antagonists and sensitive to decoinine Japanese Published Unexamined Application 64793 81 . On the other hand, there has been recently reported an attempt to utilize genetic recombination techniques for growth of L phenylalanine producing bacteria, which is different from growth using articifial mutation as described above. Japanese Published Unexamined Application 1890 81, GB A 2053906 and EP A 0085958 disclose that mutants from Furthermore, it is known to produce amino acids by transforming a Coryneform glutamic acid producing bacterium with a plasmid containing a gene coding for the biosynthesis of said amino acid EP A 0071023, GB A 2076853 . In EP A 0136359 a document according to Article 5463 , such a process is described for the production of L phenylalanine. It is an object of the present invention to provide a plasmid conferring increased L phenylalanine productivity and microorganisms capable of producing L phenylalanine with significantly increased productivity. This and other objects of the invention as will hereinafter become more readily apparent have been accomplished by providing a plasmid conferring increased L phenylalanine productivity obtainable from FERM BP 580 and microorganisms having increased L phenylalanine productivity obtainable by transforming a recipient bacterium selected from Coryneform glutamic acid producing bacteria and mutants thereof with this plasmid. Further there is provided a process for producing L phenylalanine, which comprises 1 culturing in a culture medium said microorganism having L phenylalanine productivity, and 2 recovering L phenylalanine accumulated in said culture medium. characterized in that as a microorganism having L phenyl alanine productivity there is used a microorganism as described above. A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of the attendant advantages thereof will be readily obtained by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with accompanying drawing, wherein The present inventors have noted that by incorporating a gene connected with a vector plasmid capable of replicating in cells of a Coryneform glutamic acid producing bacterium into a recipient bacterium selected from Coryneform glutamic acid producing bacteria and mutants thereof, wherein the gene when introduced into a mutant induced from a Coryneform glutamic acid producing bacterium and having auxotrophy for L phenylalanine is capable of eliminating the auxotrophy of the mutant for L phenylalanine, strains capable of producing L phenylalanine in a high yield can be obtained. These strains produce large amounts of L phenylalanine in a conventional process for producing L phenylalanine by fermentation as described below. The DNA fragment containing a gene of a phenyl alanine biosynthesis system can be obtained from chromosomal DNA of Coryneform glutamic acid producing bacteria bacteria that give a DNA fragment containing a gene of a phenylalanine biosynthesis system are referred to as DNA donors . Coryneform bacteria are aerobic, Gram positive rods, are non acid fast, and are described in Bergey s Other host bacteria include mutants of Coryneform glutamic acid producing bacteria which have lost glutamic acid productivity and mutants which produce products other than glutamic acid. It is preferred to use as DNA donors mutants having enhanced biosynthesis of phenylalanine or its precursors by imparting mutation such as resistance to phenylalanine antagonists thereto, e.g. m fluorophenylalanine. β 3 thienylalanine, and 5 methyltryptophane. The term phenylalanine precursor as used herein refers to at least chorismic acid and optionally other such as 3 dehydroxy D arabino heptulonic acid 7 phosphate, 3 dehydroquinic acid, 3 dehydroshikimic acid, shikimic acid, shikimic acid 3 phosphate, enolpyruvylshikimic acid 3 phosphate, prephenic acid, and prephenylpyruvic acid, as well as other molecules which are interemediates in the biosynthesis of phenylalanine. Examples of mutants having increased phenylalanine production are described in, for example, U.S. Patents 3,660,235 Brevibacterium lactofermentum ATCC 21420 and Corynebacterium acetoacidophilum ATCC 21421 and 3,759,970 and Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application 64793 8 Brevibacterium lactofermentum FERM P 5248 and 5246, Brevibacterium flavum FERM P 5249 and Corynebacterium acetoacidophilum FERM P 5250 . Examples of genes of the phenylalanine biosynthesis system include at least the gene for chorismic acid synthase and optionally the gene for 3 deoxy D arabino heptulonic acid 7 phosphate DAHP synthetase, the gene for 3 dehydroquinic acid synthetase, the gene for 3 dehydroquinic acid dehydratase, the gene for shikimic acid dehydrogenase, the gene for shikimic acid kinase, the gene for 5 enolpyruvyl shikimic acid 3 phosphate synthetase, and the gene for prephenic acid dehydratase. By inserting these genes in vector plasmid pAf1844 having the capability of autonomous replication and using the plasmids to introduce the genes into DNA recipients belonging to Coryneform glutamic acid producing bacteria, strains having improved productivity of phenylalanine can be obtained. As bacteria belonging to Coryneform glutamic acid producing bacteria which can be used as DNA recipients, a variety of strains as described above can be employed. When strains having auxotrophy for phenylalanine are used as recipients, transformants having introduced genes coding for a phenylalanine biosynthesis system can be easily selected by detecting disappearance of the auxotrophy. Further in case that strains sensitive to phenylalanine antagonists are employed as recipients, transformants having introduced genes coding for a phenylalanine biosynthesis system exhibiting resistance to phenylalanine antagonists can easily be selected by monitoring resistance to phenylalanine antagonists. In order to obtain transformants having higher productivity of phenylalanine, better results are obtained using as recipients mutants in which biosynthetic activity of phenylalanine or its precursors is enhanced. This may be done by imparting to the recipient a mutation such as resistance to a phenylalanine antagonist, auxotrophy for phenylalanine, etc. Furthermore, excellent results may also be obtained with mutants in which permeability of phenylalanine out of the cells is improved, mutants in which decomposition of phenylalanine is decreased, and mutants or recombinants in which biosynthetic activity of metabolites supplied for the synthesis of phenylalanine as components such as glutamine or phosphoenolpyruvate is increased. In particular, the present invention is preferably practiced when a microorganism produced by the process as described above produces L phenylalanine in an amount at least 13 mg dl higher than that produced by the bacterium which received the gene when the microorganism and the recipient bacterium are cultivated for three days under same conditions. Increases in productivity of at least 41 mg dl and at least 200 mg dl are more and most preferred, respectively. Microorganisms having these increased activities can be readily recognized by measuring the amount of L phenylalanine accumulated in the culture medium. As the vector there is used pAf1844 which can be autonomously replicate in Coryneform glutamic acid producing bacteria and has the following characteristics DNA donors or chromosomal DNAs and vector DNAs can be extracted in a conventional manner. The chromosomal DNAs and the vector DNAs are cleaved by restriction enzymes, respectively. The cleavage of the vector DNAs is achieved either by cleaving the vector DNAs with restriction enzymes for cleaving at one site or by partially reacting restriction enzymes for cleaving at a plurality of sites with the vector DNAs. With respect to chromosomal DNAs, various kinds of restriction products can be obtained by controlling reaction conditions such that cleavage with restriction endonuclease is partially effected. As methods for ligating the thus obtained chromosomal DNA fragments with the cleaved vector DNAs, conventional methods using ligase enzymes can be employed. On the other hand, there can be also utilized a method for ligation which comprises adding deoxyadenylic acid and deoxycytidylic acid or deoxyguanylic acid and deoxycytidylic acid to the chromosomal DNA fragments and to the cleaved vector DNAs, respectively, mixing them, and then annealing. The incorporation of the thus obtained recombinant DNA, comprising the chromosomal DNA and the vector plasmid, into recipients belonging to Coryneform glutamic acid producing bacteria can be done by various methods including the following treating the recipient cells with calcium chloride to increase the permeability of DNA, as is reported regarding In the protoplast method, a sufficiently, high frequency can be obtained even by the method used for Selection of the transformants carrying the vector plasmids containing the gene for phenylalanine biosynthesis system can be easily accomplished by selecting strains that have lost the auxotrophy for phenylalanine when phenylalanine auxotrophs are used as recipients and by selecting strains that have become resistant to the antagonists when genes for a phenylalanine biosynthesis system exhibiting phenylalanine antagonist resistance are introduced as recipients. It is also possible to select strains using improved productivity of phenylalanine as a measure. When genetic markers such as drug resistance, etc., are present on the vectors, the transformants can be more easily selected. The methods of culturing the L phenylalanine producing bacteria thus obtained are conventional and are similar to methods for the cultivation of conventional L phenylalanine producing bacteria. That is, the culture medium can be a conventional medium containing carbon sources, nitrogen sources, inorganic ions, and, when required, minor organic nutrients such as amino acids and vitamins. Examples of carbon sources include glucose, sucrose, lactose, starch hydrolysates containing those sugars, whey, molasses, and the like. Examples of nitrogen sources include gaseous ammonia, aqueous ammonia, ammonium salts and others. Cultivation is conducted under aerobic conditions in which the pH and the temperature of the medium are adjusted to a suitable level, and cultivation is continued until the formation and accumulation of L phenylalanine substantially cease. Thus, markedly high amounts of L phenylalanine are formed and accumulated in the culture medium. To recover L phenylalanine from the culture medium, conventional methods are applicable. The invention now being generally described, the same will be better understood by reference to certain specific examples which are included herein for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to be limiting of the invention or any embodiment thereof, unless so specified.
