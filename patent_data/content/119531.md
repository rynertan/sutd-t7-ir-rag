# Blends of aromatic polycarbonate resin, olefin polymers or copolymers and acrylate or methacrylate copolymer resins.

## Abstract
Thermoplastic molding compositions are described which comprise an admixture of a an aromatic polycarbonate resin, b an olefinic polymer or copolymer and c a third com ponent which is a copolymer of an olefin and an acrylate, meth acrylate, acrylic acid or methacrylic acid. The presence of the third component enhances impact strength in thicker sections and improves weld line strength.
