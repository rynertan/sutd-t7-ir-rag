## Description
A METHOD OF FABRIC TING PELLICLE COVER FOR PHOTOMASK Field of Invention This invention relates to projection printing systems and, more particularly, to such a system having a pellicle covering the mask and or wafer. The systems according to the invention are particularly adapted, among other possible uses, for effecting the exposure of photoresist coated semiconductor wafers in the manufacture of integrated circuits. This application is closely related to U.S. PatentApplication entitled Pellicle Cover for Projection PrintingSystem , filed on even date herewith, and bearing Attorney sDocket No. MI 3067, and U.S. Patent Application entitled Pellicle Cover for Photomask filed on even date herewith, and bearing Attorney s Docket No. MI 3114 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Projection printing systems for forming an image on a light sensitive substrate or wafer normally include a mask having a transparent substrate with a pattern of opaque and transparent areas formed on one surface thereof, an illumination system for directing a beam of radiation energy such as light or rJv rays through the mask to a radiation sensitive substrate or wafer, optical means for forming a focused image of the mask pattern on the radiation sensitive substrate and a pellicle cover for maintaining the images of any dirt particles on the surface of the mask out of focus.The pellicle cover is normally bonded to the substrate and completely covers the mask pattern. Such systems, for example, are described in U.S. Patents 4,063,812 4,246,054 and 4,131,363 and in an article by Ron Hershel entitled Pellicle Protection of Integrated Circuits Masks , appearing in SPIE, vol. 275 Semiconductor MicrolithographyVI. 1981 page 23. With increasing miniaturization, the pattern elements have become smaller and smaller to the extent that pattern resolution is limited by the wavelength of the light.This has led to the use of shorter wavelengths of the UV spectrum. One disadvantage of the mask covers used heretofore is that they are only suitable for use in the range of from 4000 angstroms and above. Thus, an object of this invention is to provide a new and improved method of making a pellicle cover, and also to use a polymer that is suitable for use in the 2000 and above range. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The foregoing and other advantages of the mask covers of the invention, as compared to mask covers heretofore utilized for the above stated purposes, will become apparent as the discussion proceeds. Briefly, in order to accomplish the desired results, the invention provides a new and improved method of fabricating a pellicle cover assembly for use in a projection printing system for forming an image on a radiation sensitive wafer, said method comprising the steps of applying a thin uniform polymer film onto a polished surface of a substrate such as a silicon wafer, curing the polymer and making a cut around the circumference of the film. The method further comprises the steps of soaking the so coated substrate in water, attaching a peeling ring to the film surface, peeling off the film, and attaching a supporting ring to the film. There has thus been broadly outlined the more important features of the invention in order that the detailed description thereof that follows may be better understood, and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated. There are, of course, additional features of the invention that will be described hereinafter and which will form the subject of the claims appended hereto. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the conception upon which the disclosure is based may readily be utilized as a basis for designing other systems for carrying out the several purposes of the invention It is important, therefore, that the claims be regarded as including such equivalent methods as do not depart from the spirit and scope of the invention. Specific embodiments of the invention have been chosen for purposes of illustration and description, and are shown in the accompanying drawings, forming a part of this specification. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 is a schematic drawing of a projection printing system for forming an image on a radiation sensitive wafer constructed in accordance with the concepts of the present invention and Figures 2 to 4 are side elevations showing the method steps involved for forming a pellicle cover assembly according to the concepts of the invention DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Referring to Figure 1, there is shown a projection printing system for forming an image on a radiation sensitive wafer, which comprises a mask 10 having a transparent substrate with a pattern of opaque and transparent areas formed on one surface thereof. An illuminating system is provided which includes a radiation source 12 and a condenser lens system 14 for directing radiation through the mask 10 to a radiation sensitive wafer member 16.An optical system 18 serves to form a focused image of the mask pattern on the wafer. A pellicle cover assembly 20 is mounted on the mask 10, as by means of a support ring 22. As a result, scratching or particulate contaminates 24, which would otherwise rest on the mask surface, now rest on the surface of the pellicle and hence are focused out of the focal plane by thousands of times the depth of field, as indicated at 26, Figure 1. Their shadows are dissipated over the image field and have no effect on the resist image. According to the invention, there is provided a new and improved method of fabricating the pellicle assembly. This method comprises the steps of applying a thin uniform polymer layer or film 28 onto a polished surface of a substrate 30, as seen in Figure 2. Any suitable polymer film may be employed. For example, a suitable material is polymethylmethacrylate, known as PMMA.Any suitable polished surface of a substrate may be used such as, for example, a silicon wafer. A particularly suitable way of applying the polymer film to the substrate is by means of conventional spinning techniques. The next step in the method is to cure the polymer, conditions being contingent on the polymer. PMMA for example must be baked at l700C for one hour.Thereafter, with a suitable tool such as a razor blade or the like, a circular cut is made around the circumference of the film as indicated at 32 in Figure 3 This cut is made through the polymer layer 28 so that the wafer 30 is exposed, as indicated at 34, Figure 3. This provides an edge where fluid can enter between the polymer film and the wafer 30. The so coated wafer is then soaked in deionized water for a suitable period of time. The polymer expands in the water and loosens its adhesion or bonding to some extent with respect to the wafer surface, thereby preparing the polymer layer 28 for subsequent removal from the substrate or wafer 30. Next, a flexible, thin, flat, preferably aluminum, peeling ring 35 is attached to the film surface as indicated at 36 in Figure 4. A suitable adhering agent is employed for this application such as, for example, double sided sticky tape. The film 28 is carefully peeled off the wafer 30 with the peeling ring 35. To complete the pellicle cover assembly 20, this film 28 is then attached to a suitable pellicle support ring 22, the design of which is dependent on the exposure tool used. A suitable adhering agent is epoxy. It will thus be seen that the present invention does indeed provide a new and improved pellicle assembly which has a high transmission in the range of from about 2400 angstroms to about 8000 angstrums, low light scattering, and thickness uniformity, and which is rugged enough to be handled and cleaned without damage. although specific embodiments have been illustrated and described, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention which is to be limited solely by the appended claims.
