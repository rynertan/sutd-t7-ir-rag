The described method of processing and transporting produce, particularly perishable vegetable matter is charac terized by the following steps placing the produce in an air tight container at a first location, sprinkling as soon as pos sible from the top of the air tight container onto the produce chilled water at a temperature of about 0 C 2.9 C while purging simultaneously the air in the container with an oxy gen free gas, then transporting the container to a second location, during transportation, maintaining the atmosphere in the container oxygen free, maintaining the temperature in the container as low as the produce tolerates and exhausting said oxygen free gas. This method is versatile, energy con serving, rapid, efficient, and inexpensive.
