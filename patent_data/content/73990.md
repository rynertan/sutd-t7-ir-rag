# Method for manufacturing an open foamed inner shoe particularly for ski boots.

## Abstract
The method comprises the step of inserting an inner liner 1 into a mold 2 having, at those areas of the inner liner which are apt to define the shoe toe end, convex patterns 4 adapted to model the interior surface of the liner 1 as mating convex areas. On the inner liner 1 , a foaming step is carried out which makes the shaping of the concave areas a perma nent one. Upon completion of the foaming operation, the liner 1 and respective foamed in padding are removed from the mold 2 , a single longitudinal seam 15 is sewn at the toe end, and a sole is applied to complete the inner shoe construction.

## Description
This invention relates to a method for manufacturing an open foamed inner shoe particularly for ski boots. It is current practice, in the manufacture of inner shoes for ski boots, to utilize an open foaming procedure, whereby an inner liner is prearranged inside a mold and overlaid, at least in part, with an outer liner. In between the two liners, so arranged, a plastics material, usually a polyurethane, is foamed in place to provide the desired padding. The liners, thus paired, are then folded over and sewn along the edges to produce the desired shape for the inner shoe. To form the toe end of the ski boot inner shoe, the above described liners are die cut such as to include, at those areas which will constitute the toe end, a pair of appendages separated from each other by a cutout. During the inner shoe manufacturing process, seams are formed to join the two appendages together and practically close the cutout and produce the desired toe end configuration. It will be appreciated from the above considerations that this prior technique involves extended labor time, as dictated by the necessity of sewing a seam which extends transversely to the shoe at the toe end thereof, that is at a relatively awckward location. Another disadvantage is that the seam, as sewn across the toe end of the inner shoe, may inconvenience the wearer, since it affects the very region where the wearer toes are located. Accordingly the task of this invention is to remove such prior drawbacks by providing a method for manufacturing an open foamed inner shoe, which affords a significant attenuation of the production steps involved in the manufacture of such an inner shoe, while resulting in a product possessed of improved features. Within this task it is an object of the invention to provide a method which,while reflecting in its main steps traditional ski boot inner shoe making procedures, exhibits some particular expedients which make it undoubtedly advantageous for the pertinent industry. It is a further object of this invention to provide a method for manufacturing a ski boot inner shoe which can be implemented through the use of currently available machinery and molds for the production of open foamed inner shoes, with but a few marginal alterations. Yet another object of the invention is to further simplify the mold design, to enable the inner shoe to be produced from a single liner, thus avoiding the necessity of providing, in order to perform the foaming operation, arrangements to hold the two liners open as with conventional techniques. Furthermore, with but a single inner liner, it becomes possible to form on the foamed portion, which is intended to remain on the shoe outside, decorative patterns, or a manufacturer s logo, and so zn. According to one aspect of the invention the above task and objects as well as yet other objects,such as will be apparent hereinafter,are achieved by a method for manufacturing an open foamed inner shoe particularly for ski boots,zharacterized in that it comprises the steps nfinserting an inner liner into a mold having,at those areas of said inner liner which are to form the inner shoe toe end,convex patterns adapted to model the inside surface of said inner liner into mating concave areas,performing on said liner a foaming operation effective to make the shape of said concave areas permanent,removing said liner and respective foamed in padding from said mold,and sewing a single longitudinal seam across the toe end and applying a sole to thus complete the inner shoe. Further features and advantages will be more apparent from the following description of a preferred, but not limitative, embodiment of a method for manufacturing an open foamed inner shoe particularly for ski boots, to be taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, where Figure t shows schematically the inner shoe forming mold in the open position thereof Figure 2 shows schematically the mold after the inner liner has been applied Figure 3 shows schematically the mold in its closed position during the foaming operation Figure 4 is a cross sectional view of the mold in its closed position during the foaming operation and Figure 5 illustrates the general configuration to be obtained for the inner shoe. Nalcing reference to the drawing figures, this method for manufacturing an open foamed inner shoe particularly for ski boots consists of inserting an inner liner 1 into a mold 2 formed with an imprint 3 which mates with the shape of the inner liner 1. moreover, and here resides a peculiar feature of the invention, the cited imprint 3 defines, at those areas of the inner liner 4 which are to form the toe end of the shoe, convex patterns 4 which enable in practice the inside surface of the inner liner to be modelled with mating concave areas. Also provided in the mold are means for holding the inner liner 1 closely against the imprint bottom said means may advantageously comprise pull out tape lengths 5 or pegs formed integral with the mold, or other equivalent elements suitable to hold the liner closely against the imprint. After positioning the inner liner 1, the mold is closed by a mold cover or die 20, which has at the locations of the convex patterns 2 mating protrusions 30 which allow the area of the shoe toe end to be modelled as desired. Upon closing the mold, the foaming operation is carried out in a manner known per se to produce the shoe inner padding. During this operation, at least a part of the padding is admitted into the cited concave areas such that the latter can acquire a permanent shape. Thus, the desired rounding off of the shoe toe end can be achieved. Upon completion of the foaming operation, and after opening the mold, the article of manufacture is removed, and a sewing operation is performed to produce, at the toe end, but a single middle longitudinal seam 15, as shown in Figure 3, and optionally sew on the shoe sole where the sole is not cemented in place. It will be appreciated that with this procedure, the rounding to be produced at the toe end area is achieved through a suitable shaping of the liner, as obtained on account of the particular shape of the molds and of the method followed, rather than by sewing across the toe end, as with conventional methods. Tabus, a product is provided which, besides affording much improved aesthetic features over the prior art, also has the advantage of being more comfortable to wear, since there no sewn seam which could inconvenience the wearer at the toe region of the foot. moreover, a significant economical advantage is achieved thanks to the use of a single liner. The invention as described is susceptible to many modifications and variations without departing from the scope of the instant inventive concept. Furthermore, all of the details may be replaced with other technically equivalent elements. In practicing the invention, the materials used, as well as the dimensions and contingent shapes, may be any selected ones to meet individual requirements.
