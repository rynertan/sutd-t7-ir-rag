# Continuous plus embedded servo data position control system for magnetic disk device.

## Abstract
A magnetic disk drive of the type in which a disk assembly has a dedicated servo surface containing circular tracks of dedicated servo signals and data surfaces containing circular data tracks divided into sectors each of which includes a data field and a servo field containing embedded servo signals, a dedicated servo signal detector for detecting servo signals on said dedicated surface, an embedded signal detector for de tecting embedded servo signals on a data surface and a head positioning system for positioning a read write head over a selected data track. The entire output of the embedded signal detector is combined with the high frequency components of the output of the dedicated signal detector to produce a composite track error signal and the head positioning system responds to the composite track error signal to maintain the read write head over the selected data track.
