# Manufacturing process of magnetic recording medium.

## Abstract
A manufacturing process of a magnetic recording me dium comprising a composite film of an organic polymer and a ferromagnetic substance on an non magnetic support means using a multicomponent simultaneous vapor deposition pro cess, in which process an incident beam a of the organic poly mer A is irradiated on the support means substrate 1 at an incident angle Ψ₁ in the range of 60 Ψ₁ 90 while an inci dent beam b of the ferromagnetic substance B is irradiated thereon so as not to be overlapped with the incident beam a of the organic polymer A , to form a high density magnetic re cording medium having an improved magnetic property and having a magnetic anisotropy in the direction either perpendi cular to or parallel to the surface of the magnetic film by selec tively setting the incident direction b of the magnetic sub stance B in relation to the incident direction a of the organic polymer A .
