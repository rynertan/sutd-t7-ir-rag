## Description
PREPARATION OF N CHLOROIMIDES AND A NOVEL N CHLOROIMIDE. The invention relates to the chlorination of imides to prepare N chloroimides and to a novel N chloroimide. The principal prior art processes for preparing N chloroimides customarily have involved the use of an aqueous system. In general, such prior art processes for preparing N chloro ..ides can be classified as foliows 1 Chlorination of the corresponding imide usiny an inorganic hypochlorite in a mixture of acetic acid and water 2 Chlorination by passing chlorine into an aqueous solution comprising equivalent amounts of the corresponding imide and a strong base, e.g., sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide 3 Chlorination of the corresponding imide using t butyl hypochlorite in a mixture of t butyl alcohol and water. Of the above general methods, only method 2 prescribes the use of chlorine itself in the production of the N chloroimide. However, due to the fact of the aqueous system, this method has been found to have serious drawbacks. First, chlorine is only very slightly soluble in water. Secondly, and more importantly, it is known that an imide, when present in an alkaline aqueous medium such as would result from potassium or sodium hydroxide and water, undergoes rapid hydrolysis. Even more importantly, it has been established tHurwitz, Degradation of N Chlorosuccinimide in Aqueous Solution , Diss. Abst., B, 28 3 , 971 1967 that zn N chloroimide product, when present in an aqueous alkaline medium, such as would be the case under the conditions of chlorination provided by method 2 above, degrades with possible formation of the highly explosive and toxic gas, nitrogen trichloride. Non aqueous processes for preparingN chloro compounds have been few. A process for preparing N halo t alkyl cyanamides is described inU.S. Patent No. 2,686,203. This process treats a t alkyl cyanamide with molecular chlorine in an inert solvent and in the presence of a molar equivalent of a halogen acid acceptor, typically pyridine. Recently, a method for preparing Nchlorophthalimide under substantially non aqueous reaction conditions was discovered. The aforementioned deficiencies of an aqueous alkaline medium thus were avoided by this method which involves contacting an alkali metal salt of phthalimide with chlorine under non aqueous conditions in the presence of a halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbon and at a temperature of from about 100C. to about 400C. Belgian Patent 853,686. This invention provides an even more advantageous process for preparing N chloroimides, which comprises contacting the corresponding imide with molecular chlorine under substantially anhydrous conditions in the presence of 1 an epoxy compound in an amount representing at least about one epoxy moiety per each imide moiety and 2 at least a catalytic amount of a tertiary amine. More particularly, the invention comprises contactiny an imide containing one or more of the moietiesEMI3.1 with molecular chlorine as described above. In more preferred embodiments, the invention comprises contacting with molecular chlorine, as described above, the imides phthalimide, succinimide, saccharin, glutarimide, 3,3 dimethylglutar imide, maleimide, , 4 tetrahydrophthalimide, term ahy 3,4,5, 6 tetrachlorophthalimide, pyromellitic diimide, benzophenone tetracarboxylic diimide, naphthalene 1,4,5,8 tetracarboxylic diimide, chlorendic imide, carbonyl salicylamide, diphenimide, tetrahydrofuran tetracarboxylic imide, 1,8 naphthalimide, or bicyclo 2.2.2 oct 7 ene 2, 3,5, 6 tetracarboxylic 2,3,5,6 diimide, to prepare the corresponding Nchloroimides. The present invention is advantageous in that it avoids the deccmpw ion likely to result from the aqueous chlorinatis processes, and is carried out on the imide itself, rather than on a salt thereof. N chloroimides, the products of the process of this invention, have long been recognized as reagents useful in reactions requiring a source of positive chlorine. Examples of such reactions are, for example, oxidation of alcohols, sulfides, amines, and imines chlorination of amines, reactive aromatic systems, carbonyl compounds having ahydrogens, and the like. Publications which describe such reactions include R. Filler, Chem. Revs. 63, 21 1963 and R. Stroh, Methoden der OrganischenChemie Houben Weil , Vol. 5, Part 3, pp. 760 762, 796 et seq., Geory Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart 1962 . Recently, it has been discovered that a penicillin sulfoxide can be converted to the corresponding 3 methylenecepham sulfoxide by the following sequence EMI4.1 This reaction is reported in Kukolja et al., Journal of the American Chemical Society, 98, 5040 1976 and is further elaborated in Belgian Patent No.837,040. The first step contemplates thermal generation of the sulfenic acid which then is trapped by oxidation to the sulfinyl chloride. The sulfinyl chloride is cyclized to the 3 exomethylenecepham sulfoxide using a Lewis acid reagent, in particular, stannic chloride. The first step, formation of the sulfinyl chloride, requires use of a positive chlorine reagent, and, in particular, an N chloroimide. Particularly preferred N chloroimides in accordance with Belgian Patent No. 837,040 includeN chlorophthalimide, N chlorosuccinimide, and Nchloroglutarimide. In carrying out the above penicillin sulfoxide reaction, it is desirable to employ an Nchloroimide having certain properties. First, it is desirable to use an N chloroimide having a level of reactivity which is neither too great nor too small, that is, a level which provides reaction at readily available conditions while being sufficiently unreactive and stable to provide ease of handling and use in the intended reaction. Secondly, it is desirable to employ an N chloroimide which will produce, as byproduct, a corresponding imide which is sufficiently insoluble in the reaction system to permit ready removal from the reaction medium and, thus, easy isolation of the desired product. These properties are provided by the novelN chloroimide, N,N dichlorobicyclo 2.2. 2 oct 7 ene 2, 3,5, 6 tetracarboxylic 2 ,3, 5, 6 diimide of the formula EMI6.1 As indicated, the above compound is highly suitable for use as a positive chlorine source in the reaction reported by Kukolja et al.since 1 it is both sufficiently stable to permit ready use and sufficiently reactive to provide a ready source of positive chlorine, and 2 it gives rise to a highly insoluble diimide byproduct which can be conveniently removed from the reaction medium. The stability of the compound is indicated by the fact that it melts with decomposition only after being heated to a temperature of 2660C. Furthermore, it remains unaffected after extended periods, for example, 16 hours, of toluene reflux.Other more reactive N chloroimides are at least partially destroyed by reaction with the solvent when the mixture is maintained for extended periods at elevated temperature. For example, N chlorosuccinimide is reported to react with toluene 1100C., 16 hours to produce both ring and cr substitution. C. Yavoslavsky and E. Katchalski,Tetrahedron Letters, 51, 5173 1972 1. Moreover, the compound of formula I is sufficiently soluble in organic solvents which are commonly employed in carrying out positive chlorine reactions to permit such reaction to occur. For example, its solubility in boiling toluene is approximately 3 g. per liter. Conversely, its correspondins diimide, the byproduct from a positive chlorine reaction, is almost entirely isoluble and thus is readily removable from the reaction mixture.The solubility of the dlimide in oiling tclene is less than 25 mg. per liter. Moreover, the c mrde byproduct is highly stable and crystalline, having a meltin point in excess of 410 C. The compound of formula I is most 2d vantageously prepared by the use of the novel process which has been described. It may also be made, however, by the common processes of the prior art b N chlorinating bicyclo 2.2.2 oct 7 ene 2,3, ,6 tetracarboxylic 2,3,5,6 diimide. A useful prior art process for such N ch iorination is illustrated in Example 16 below, hertz the diimide is N chlorinated with molecular chlorine in acetic acid in the presence of an acetate.The reaction occurs efficiently at temperatures from OOC. to about 800C. The chlorination which prepares the compound of formula I may also be carried out with other prior art N chlorinating agents, of which hypochlorites are best known and most often used.In iparticular, tertiary butyl hypochlorite may be used, and alkali metal hypochlorites such as sodium and calcium hypochlorites have been commonly employed in the prior art for N chlrination. Further, still other well known prior art N chlorination procedures can be used to prepare the compound of formula I.For example, l chlorobenzotriazole is an adequate reagent, and the chloroisocyanuric acids are also used as N chlorinating agents. Exemplary publications concerning the pre aration of N chloroimides include Filler and Strh, cited above, and Oelschlaeger et al., charm. Acta. Helv. 47, 1 6 1972 Matsushim et al.,Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 271, 243 51 1972 andCinquini et al., Synthesis 1972, 259 60. As is explained in prior art such as the above, the commonly used N chlorinating agents are effective when used in solvents such as the chlo urinated aliphatic and aromatic solvents as discussed bel , and also in aqueous reaction mixtures. In general, reaction temperatures from OOC. to 50 C.are effective and are commonly used. As indicated hereinabove, this invention provides a process for preparing N chloroimides.The process of this invention involves the inter act, n of molecular chlorine with the imide corr spoding to the intended N chloroimide product under sub ntially anhydrous conditions. The reaction defined by the process of thiE invention is equimolar in the sense that one mole of chlorine is consumed for each mole of available imide moiety. Therefore, it is highly preferred that at least one mole of chlorine is present per each mole of imide moiety. Even more preferably, about a 10 molar excess of chlorine is brought into contact with the imide. The temperature at which the reaction is carried out is not critical, but generally ranges from about 100C. to about SOOC. and, preferably, from about 5 C. to about 25 C. The reaction generally is completed after a period of from about 1 hour to about 24 hours, and, preferably, is carried out over a period of from about 3 to 15 hours. A further feature of the process of this invention is that it can be and is carried out under substantially anhydrous conditions. It is not intended by the term substantially anhydrous conditions to mean the total absence of water from the reaction system instead, this term prescribes the exercise of reasonable precautions to ensure its preclusion, including the avoidance of any deliberate addition of water to the reaction medium prior to or during the time in which the reaction is being effected. Amounts of water which are customarily present in such commercial solvents and reactants as may be employed in the process of this invention need not first be removed in order to comply with the substantially non aqueous requirement. In general, amounts of water up to about 0.2 of the reaction mixture are not harmful. Although it is not an essential feature of the process of this invention, the reaction can be carried out in the presence of an inert organic solvent. By the term solvent is intended that medium which partially or completely solubilizes the imide starting material. The term inert defines a solvent which generally does not react with the reactants, principally, with the chlorine, under the conditions of the process. Typical such solvents are halogenated aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons.Examples of halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons are chlorobenzene, 1, 2 dichlorobenzene, 1,4 dichlorobenzene, bromobenzene, and the like. Examples of halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons are methylene chloride, chloroform, 1,1,2 trichloroethane, 1,2dichloroethane, l,l dichloroethane, l,l,l trichloroethane, and the like. Of the above, the halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons are preferred, and, of these, the preferred solvent is methylene chloride. The imide starting material employed in the process of this invention is defined broadly as a diacylamine compound and specifically as a compound containing one or more of either or both of the following moieties EMI11.1 Preferably, these imides do not contain additional functional groups which would be reactive under the conditions of this invention. Typical such functional groups, the presence of which preferably is avoided, are ether, epoxy, hydroxy, amino, sulfide, sulf oxide, carboxyl, and active methylene as well as other such groups having at least one acidic hydrogen. Illustrations of specific imides which are particularly suitable for the process of this invention are phthalimide, succinimide, saccharin, glutarimide, 3,3 dimethylglutarimide, maleimide, A4 tetrahydrophthalimide, 3,4,5,6 tetrachlorophthalimide, pyromellitic diimide, benzophenone tetracarboxylic diimideEMI11.2 naphthalene 1,4,5,8 tetracarboxylic diimide EMI12.1 chlorendic imideEMI12.2 carbonyl salicylimideEMI12.3 diphenimideEMI13.1 tetrahydrofuran tetracarboxylic diimideEMI13.2 1,8 naphthalimideEMI13.3 bicyclo 2.2 2loct 7 ene 2,3,5,6 tetracarboxylic 2,3,5,6 diimide. The foregoing is intended to be illustrative only and is indicative of the wide variety of imides, including polyimides, which are suitable for use in the prccess of this invention. Particularly preferred imides for use in the process of this invention are phthalimide, succinimide, saccharin, and bicyclo 2.2.2loc. 7 ene 2,3,5,6 tetracarboxylic 2,3,5,E diimide. Of the above, the most preferred imides are phthalimide and bicyclo 2.2.230ct 7 er.R 2,3,5,6 tetracarboxylic 2,3,5,6 diimide. In addition to the principal reactants, that is, molecular chlorine and the selected imide, the process of this invention contemplates the use of a catalyst and an acid scavenger. The catalyst and scavenger are believed to work in combination to effect removal of the hydrogen chloride by product which forms in the process of this invention during reaction of the molecular chlorine with the imide.It is believed that the scavenger serves as the ultimate repository for the hydrogen chloride while the catalyst serves as a transfer agent by which the generated hydrogen chloride by product is made available for pick up by the scavenger. In the context of this invention, the scavenger is an epoxy compound. The epoxy compound is present in an amount at least equivalent to the amount of imide starting material. As used in this context, the term equivalent means the presence of at least one epoxy moiety per each imide moiety. A large excess of the epoxy compound can be employed without detriment. However, for the sake of convenience and economy, it is preferred that the epoxy compound be present in an amount of from about 1.1 to about 5 equivalents per equivalent of tho imide starting material.It is further preferred to employ an epoxy compound having a terminal epoxide group, that is, one containing the moietyEMI15.1 Typical preferred epoxy compounds are ethylene oxide propylene oxide, 1,2 epoxybutane, butadiene diepoxide, 1,2 epoxy 3 phenoxypropane, 1,4 butanediol diglycidyl ether, 1,2,7,8 diepoxyoctane, and the like. The most preferred epoxy compounds are propylene oxide and 1,2 epoxybutane. In combination with the scavenger, a catalyst is employed. The catalyst is present in a small but significant quantity, generally from about 0.01 to about 0.04 mole equivalents per equivalent of the imide moiety present in the imide starting material. A larger amount can be employed without detriment. The catalyst which is employed in the process of this invention is a tertiary amine having properties which make it suitable to serve as a catalytic transfer agent. By catalytic transfer agent is intended a tertiary amine which achieves transfer of the hydrogen chloride by product from the site of the protonated N chloroimide intermediate to the scavenger where it is permitted to react with the scavenger and thereby be removed from the reaction medium.The tertiary amine which is employed has characteristics which permit formation of its hydrochloride salt by deprotonation of the protonated N chloroimide intermediate. The resulting hydrochloride salt is sufficiently soluble in the reaction medium to permit its transport to the scavenger and sufficiently unstable to permit reaction with the scavenger. Thus, the tertiary amine catalyst has the following characteristics 1 ability to generate its hydrochloride salt by reaction with the protonated N chloroimide intermediate and 2 generation of a hydrochloride salt, the properties of which include a at least partial solubility in the reaction medium, and b sufficient instability to react with the scavenger with removal of the hydrogen chloride and regeneration of the free tertiary amine. Typical tertiary amines which are suitable for use in the process of this invention are 1,5 diazabicyclo 4.3. 0 non 5 ene DBN , 1,5 diazabi cyclo 5.4.0 undec 5 ene DBU , pyridine, 1,8 bis dimethylamino naphthalene, 4 dimethylaminopyridine,N,N dimethylbenzylamine, diisopropylethylamine, quinoline, 2,4,6 trimethylpyridine, pyrimidine, pyrazine, and the like. In general, pyridine or structural derivatives of pyridine, including quinolines, are preferred for use as catalysts in the process of this invention. Of high preference are pyridine and, especially, quinoline. An example of a typical preparation of anN chloroimide in accordance with the process of this invention is as follows Phthalimide 0.6 mole is slurried in methylene chloride about 1.7 liters or less , and the mixture is chilled to about O SOC. 1,2Epoxybutane 3.0 moles and quinoline 0.006 mole are added. Sufficient chlorine about 0.66 mole , either as a gas or a liquid, is added by introducing it below the surface of the slurry by means of an inlet tube. The cooling bath then is removed, and the mixture is allowed to warm to a temperature not in excess of about 250C. After about 1 3 hours, the phthalimide starting material will be gone or nearly gone, and the mixture will have slowly cleared to a yellow solution.A partial vacuum then is applied to the mixture for a few minutes to remove excess chlorine, and amylene 2 methyl 2 butene is added to take up the remaining chlorine leaving a pale straw colored reaction mixture. Some exothermicity may be noted as the amylene reacts with the excess chlorine. The excess 1,2 epoxybutane and methylene chloride are removed in vacuo at a temperature not in excess of about 25 300C. The N chlorophthalimide product crystallizes out oz solution as the solvent is removed. The volume of the mixture is reduced to approximately 130 150 ml. and comprises mainly product and butylene chlorohydrin. The mixture is chilled in ice for about one hour and filtered, and the collected product is washed with a small volume of cold toluene or petroleum ether.The product is vacuum dried at 250C. for about 18 hours to obtain the product as colorless to off white granular crystals in an amount representing a 92 96 yield. The examples which follow are illustrative of the process of this invention. They are provided solely for the purpose of illustration and are not intended to be limiting on the broad scope of this invention.

Example 14 To 1,000 ml. of methylene chloride were added 246.2 g. 1 mole of bicyclo 2.2.2 oct 7 ene 2 ,3,5, 6 tetracarboxylic 2, 3,5, 6 diimide, 600 ml. of propylene oxide, and 4.7 ml. 0.04 mole of quinoline. The mixture was cooled to 200C,, and chlorine addition was begun at a rate sufficient to permit maintenance of the temperature of the mixture at 20 300C. with ice cooling After about 40 minutes, the mixture began to thicken, and the chlorine addition rate was reduced. After 2.5 hours the chlorine rate was reduced to a slow eat, and the mixture was stirred gently overnight at about 25 30QC. In the morning, the reaction mixture 250C. was white.The rate of chlorine addition was increased, and, after 2.5 hours, the temperature had increased to 300C. Chlorine addition was discontinued, and the reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo to remove excess propylene oxide and chlorine. After about 25 minutes, the temperature had dropped to 50C.The reaction mixture was filtered rapidly, and the filter cake was washed successively with 500 1000 ml.of methylene chloride, ether, toluene, and pentane.The filter cake then was air dried for several hours, and the solid was further dried in vacuo at 40 50 C. overnight to obtain 308.4 g. of N,N dichlorobi cyclo 2.2.2 oct 7 ene 2,3,5,6 tetracarboxylic 2,3, 5,6 diimide, m.p. 2660C. dec. . Analysis Percent Cl Theory 22.5 Found 21.7. Some methylene chloride may be retained in the product. This is removed by ref fluxing the N chloroimide in toluene. Example 15 To a 1 1. flask were added 125 g. from a total of 267.7 g. of phthalimide, 170.6 g. of cold 1,2 epoxybutane, and 2.3 g. of quinoline. The mixture was cooled to 13QC., stirred, and chlorine was added by means of a tube extending beneath the surface of the mixture. The mixture was maintained at 13 150C., and about 56 g. of chlorine were added over about 1.5 hours. During. the chlorine addition, the mixture first became thicker and then progressively thinner. The chlorine addition was discontinued, and 96 g. of phthalimide were added to the mixture. The temperature was maintained at 14 150C., and chlorine addition again was begun. About 40 g. of the chlorine were added over a period of about 0.75 hours during which time the thick mixture again became thinner. Chlorine addition was discontinued, and the remainder of the phthalimide, providing a total of 267.7 g., was added to the mixture. Chlorine addition again was begun, and about 30 g. of chlorine were added over a period of about 0.5 hours, the temperature again being maintained at 12 150C. The mixture was allowed to warm to 210C. over 0.5 hours. A sample of the mixture was removed and analyzed by thin layer chromatography TLC . The analysis indicated the presence of some unreacted starting material. The mixture then was cooled to about 120C., and 6.5 g. of chlorine were added. The mixture again was allowed to warm to temperature and filtered to obtain 322.4 g. of N chlorophthalimide, essentially identical to the product of Example 1. Anal sis Percent C1 Theory 19.5 Found 18.7. Example 16 A 369 g. portion of bicyclo 2.2.2 oct 7 ene 2,3,5,6 tetracarboxylic 2,3,5,6 diimide was combined with 369 g. of sodium acetate in 1500 ml.of acetic acid with stirring under a chlorine atmosphere. The temperature was maintained at 400C. with slight cooling for 1 hour. The temperature was then lowered to 320C., and the sides of the flask were washed down with a little additional acetic acid. The reaction mixture was then heated to 600C. and was stirred at that temperature while it was kept saturated with chlorine by bubbling gas through the mixture. The heat and chlorine flow were then turned off, and the mixture was stirred gently for 2 hours more. At the end of this time, its temperature was 270C. The flask was then washed down with 300 ml. of methylene chloride, and the mixture was cooled in an ice bath. Over a period of 25 minutes, 2500 ml. of ice cold water was added to the mixture. The temperature was then 50C. The mixture was then filtered, and the solids were washed with 1500 ml.of water and 1500 ml. of methylene chloride. The product was then dried in a vacuum desiccator at 30 400C. to obtain 472 g. of N,N dichlorobicyclo 2.2.2 oct 7 ene 2,3,5,6 tetracarboxylic 2,3,5,6 diimide, substantially identical to the product ofExample 14. Example 17 A portion of bicyclo 2.2.2 oct 7 ene 2,3,5,6 tetracarborylic 2,3,5,6 dizzide is dissolved in methylene chloride. A portion of tertiary butyl hypochlorite is added, and the reaction mixture stirred for 16 hours. The reaction mixture is then evaporated to dryness under vacuum, to obtain crude N,N dichlorobicyclo 2.2.2 oct 7 ene 2,3,5,6 tetracarboxylic 2,3,5,6 diimide, which is further purified by recrystallization to obtain the essentially pure compound, substantially identical to the product of Example 14.
