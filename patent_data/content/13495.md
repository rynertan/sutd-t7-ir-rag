# Positive displacement device.

## Abstract
The device may be used as a pump, a motor or a vibrator for concrete. It includes a body 10 having at least three, and preferably four or five wall portions 42 , which are disposed one after the other along the axis of the body 10 , discrete chambers 43 being formed behind each wall portion 42 , which may, for example, be a toroidal diaphragm, means 24 55 being provided to feed an operating fluid under pres sure to the discrete chambers 43 to move the wall portions 42 transversely to the axis of the body 10 in a sequence to cause displacement of an external fluid axially of the body 10 . When used as a motor, movement of the external fluid th axially of the body will cause displacement of the wall por tions and thus flow of the operating fluid so that power may be derived therefrom.
