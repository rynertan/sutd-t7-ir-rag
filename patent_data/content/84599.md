# 9,10 Bis alkylphenylethynyl anthracenes and chemiluminescent compositions.

## Abstract
Bis p alkylphenylethynyl anthracenes are described for use as fluorescer components in chemiluminescent reaction mixtures and in precursor solutions or solid mix tures. Chemiluminescent mixtures comprising these fluo rescers are shown to generate higher light capacity and higher quantum yields than those made with similar prior art fluorescers.
