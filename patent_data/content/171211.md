# Container locking.

## Abstract
The hinged door 2 of a cargo container is provided with a locking mechanism contained wholly or mainly within the thickness of the door to draw the door into a closed and sealed position with respect to its surrounding door frame 4 . In one arrangement the mechanism has a tapered locking bolt 16 that can be slid into a receiving recess 34 in the surrounding door frame such that engagement of one face 36 of the bolt taper with the socket urges the door its fully closed and sealed position as the bolt is extended into the recess, and when the bolt is retracted engagement of the recess with the opposite face 40 of the bolt taper breaks the door seal. In another ar rangement the mechanism has a rotary pin 54 projecting into a cam track 56 to effect locking engagement.
