# Process for preparing magnetic layer and magnetic head prepared using the same.

## Abstract
Ion implantation is conducted in a desired area s of the surface of a magnetic layer, and annealing of the layer is carried out to control the composition in that desired area s . The control of the composition may be facilitated by applying a one directional or rotating magnetic field during ion implantation. In preparing a magnetic head, a portion of a magnetic pole at least on one side thereof in close proximity to a magnetic recording medium is formed into an iron or iron based magnetic alloy film, at least part of which is subjected to ion implantation and annealing.
