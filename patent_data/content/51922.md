# Cable having a sheath surrounding a conductor.

## Abstract
Considerable problems are experienced with cables when inserting them in conduit. Only a limited length can be inserted in the conduit so that there must be frequent joints in the cable and the outer sheath is often damaged. The present invention provides a laminate which is particularly applicable as the outer sheath on a cable and which includes a first inner layer of plastics and an outer layer of different harder plastics and incom patible with the first layer and bonded to the inner layer by a bonding layer which is a mixture of the plastics of the two layers. The laminate has applications in addition to cable sheaths.
