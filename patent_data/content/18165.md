# A bath and a process for electrodepositing ruthenium, a concentrated solution for use in forming the bath and an object having a ruthenium coating.

## Abstract
The invention provides a bath that is operable at, or close to, pH7 to deposit a coating of ruthenium on a sub strate eg. the contacts of electrical switches, which does away with the need to provide a protective coating on the substrate prior to ruthenium plating. The bath contains the product of the reaction between i a compound or a com plex that contains a nitrogen bridge linkage joining togeth er two ruthenium atoms and ii an aqueous solution of oxalic acid or of an oxalate, or of another dibasic organic aliphatic acid or its salt. The invention provides also a process of coating a conductive substrate with ruthenium, characterised in that it is carried out in a divided cell with the said bath as ca tholyte, that the anolyte is a solution of the dibasic acid with a pH of approximately 2 and wherein the current den sity is not less than 2A dmÂ². Furthermore the invention pro vides a concentrated solution for use in forming said bath as well as an object having a ruthenium coating produced by said process.
