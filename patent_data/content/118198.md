## Abstract
A magnet pole piece for an NMR imaging magnet is made of a plurality of magnetic wires 3 with one end of each wire held in a non magnetic spacer 1 , the other ends of the wires being brought to a pinch 5 , and connected to a magnetic core 6 . The wires are embedded in a synthetic resin 4 and the magnetisation and uniformity thereof can be varied by adjusting the density of the wires at the spacer which forms the pole piece.
