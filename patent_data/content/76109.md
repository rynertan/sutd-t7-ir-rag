# Method of producing grain oriented silicon steel sheets having excellent magnetic properties.

## Abstract
A grain oriented silicon steel sheet having excellent magnetic properties can be stably produced by adjusting properly the C content in a silicon steel to be used as a starting material depending upon the Si content in the steel, removing a proper amount of C from the steel during the course after the hot rolling and before the final cold rolling, and further carrying out the final cold rolling at a reduction rate of 40 80 .
