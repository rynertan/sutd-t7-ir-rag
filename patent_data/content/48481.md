# SHAPED POLYESTER COMPOSITE MATERIAL HAVING AN ACTIVATED SURFACE THEREOF AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCING THE SAME

## Abstract
A shaped polyester composite material having an excel lent bonding property to rubber, comprises a shaped substrate comprising an aromatic linear polyester matrix and 0.3 to 15 , based on the weight of the matrix, of silicon dioxide fine particles having an average size of 5 to 100 millimicrons and dispersed in at least a surface portion of the substrate, and a surface coating layer formed on the fine particle containing surface portion of the substrate and comprising a surface activating material consisting of at least one member selected from silane conpling compounds and organic titanium compounds, the surface coating layer having been heat treated at a temperature of 50 C or more but at least 10 C below the melting point of the polyester matrix.
