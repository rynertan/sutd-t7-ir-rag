# Developing apparatus.

## Abstract
A developing apparatus comprises a developing roll 11 for carrying a nonmagnetic toner 17 thereon, and an elastic blade 13 pressed against the outer circumferential surface of the developing roll 11 to apply the toner 17 thereto. The toner 17 is applied to the surface of the developing roll 11 by the elastic blade 13 to form a thin layer of the toner 17 on the surface of the developing roll 11 . The thin layer is opposed to a photosensi tive body 15 to deposit the toner 17 on a latent image on the photosensitive body 15 . The developing roll 11 has a surface 12 which is opposite to the photosensitive body 15 and the whole of which is roughened.
