# BLEND OF POLYARYLENE SULFIDE AND WHOLLY AROMATIC POLYESTER

## Abstract
A polymer blend which is capable of exhibiting an anisotropic melt phase, improved processability characteris tics and the ability to form molded articles having satisfac tory mechanical properties is provided. The polymer blend comprises approximately 5 to approximately 95 percent by weight, based upon the total weight of the blend, of a polyarylene sulfide and approximately 5 to approximately 95 percent by weight, based upon the total weight of the blend, of a melt processable wholly aromatic polyester which is capable of forming an anisotropic melt phase apart from the blend. Blend compositions containing high concentrations of wholly aromatic polyester i.e., at least 60 percent by weight wholly aromatic polyester can be used to form fibers and films.
