# BEARING BRACKET FOR OUTER WALL VENETIAN BLINDS

## Abstract
The present invention relates in brief to a bearing bracket mainly for outer wall Venetian blinds. The bearing bracket comprises, on the one hand, a lifting roll 4 and on the other hand, a turning roll 13 , these rolls being connected by a coupling 11, 19, 20 which during rotation of the lifting roll 4 in varying directions causes the turning roll 13 to be moved to various predetermined positions of adjustment for the skewing of the blind laths. The predeter mined positions of adjustment corresponding to a complete ly open, completely closed and slightly open Venetian blind. The coupling 11, 19, 20 comprises a ratchet wheel 11 having two rows of ratchet teeth and two pawls 19, 20 for cooperation with one row each of ratchet teeth on the ratchet wheel 11 . When rotating the lifting roll 4 the turning roll 13 is carried to the position corresponding to the predeter mined positions of adjustment for the skewing of the blind laths. In said positions resp. pawl 19, 20 is brought out of latching engagement with the corresponding set of ratchet teeth on the ratchet wheel 11 and the coupling is disen gaged. A sleeve 50 is arranged around the ratchet wheel 11 and the ratchet wheel 11 is rotatable within the sleeve. The sleeve 50 has openings through which the teeth of the pawls 19, 20 can engage the teeth of the ratchet wheel. The sleeve 50 has two abutments of which during the rotation of the ratchet wheel 11 one or the other, depending on the direction of rotation, is brought into contact with the disengaged pawl 19, 20 and lifts it up so that its teeth are free from the teeth of the ratchet wheel 11 .
