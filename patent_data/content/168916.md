# Fluidized catalytic cracking process.

## Abstract
Process and apparatus for the fluid catalytic FCC of hydrocarbons. The output of a reactor riser zone 3 is fed a riser cyclone separator 5 , a primary cyclone separator 7 , and secondary cyclone separators 9 , connected in series within a single reactor vessel 1 . The riser cyclone separator is connected to the primary cyclone separator by a conduit 121, 123 , which pre vents random post riser thermal cracking of the hydrocarbons after they exit the riser cyclone separator. An opening in the conduit 127 is provided to allow stripping gas to enter the conduit. Catalyst separated in the riser cyclone separator can drop through a riser cyclone dipleg 124 and can then pass through a dipleg seal which comprises a seal pot or catalyst held around the dipleg. Steam may be directed into the riser cyclone separator to improve the separation of hydrocarbons from catalyst.
