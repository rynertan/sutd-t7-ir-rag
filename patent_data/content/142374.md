# A computerized system for imparting an expressive microstructure to a musical score.

## Abstract
A computerized system into which is fed the nominal values of a musical score, the system acting to process these values with respect to the amplitude contour of individual tones, the relative loudness of different tones in a succession thereof, changes in the duration of the tones and other deviations from the nominal values which together consti tute the microstructure of the music notated by the score. The system yields the specified tones of the score as modified by the microstructure, thereby imparting expressiv ity to the music that is lacking in the absence of the microstructure.
