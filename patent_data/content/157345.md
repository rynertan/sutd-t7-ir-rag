# APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR PAD BATCH DYEING OF TUBULAR KNITTED COTTON FABRICS

## Abstract
For pad batch dyeing of tubular knitted fabrics of sub stantial cotton content. one or more connected strings of tu bular knitted fabric F are advanced toward a dyeing appa ratus, where the fabric is gripped across its full width and positively advanced toward the dye solution 120 . A ring guide spreader 30 is positioned in close coupled relation to the driven entry roller 28 and spreads the fabric to flat form and to its natural greige width. Closely coupled to the ring guide means is a dye pad station comprising a pair of horizontally opposed resilient squeeze rollers 32, 33 , a treating roller 34 forming a submerged dye nip with the front squeeze roller, and a submerged guide roller 35 to receive the fabric as it travels in a downward incline through the dye nip and redirect it to a vertically upward path for passage through the squeeze nip. The squeeze rol lers 32, 33 are submerged in the dye liquor 120 to a depth less than half their diameter.
