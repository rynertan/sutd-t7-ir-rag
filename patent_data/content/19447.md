# Three mirror anastigmatic optical system.

## Abstract
Primary mirror 12, secondary mirror 14 and tertiary mirror 16 form an anastigmatic relayed image forming optical system which is off axis and decentered in both aperture and field angle. The secondary and tertiary mirrors are tilted and decentered relative to the optical axis of the primary mirror to enhance image quality. Additional advantages include compact packaging, easy accessibility to all components, and improved shielding of unwanted out of field radiation.
