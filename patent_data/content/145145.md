# Ignition apparatus for internal combustion engines.

## Abstract
An ignition apparatus for internal combustion engines has means for preventing input noise from an ignition signal line from affecting the ignition timing of the engine to cause knock or a start malfunction. A bistable circuit 8 is provided for eliminating such input noise. The bistable circuit is associated with a Schmitt circuit 5 which serves to energize or de energize an ignition coil 3 for inducing a discharge voltage. The Schmitt circuit is overridden by the bistable circuit for a time interval corresponding to a time for which such input noise exists. Afterwards, the Schmitt circuit receives as an input the ignition signal in synchronism with the engine speed and controls the ignition timing.
