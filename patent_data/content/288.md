## Description
Curable Polyurethane Prepolymers and Polyurethane Based Adhesive Compositions This invention relates to curable polyurethane prepolymers and adhesive compositions based thereon.Such adhesive compositions are particularly well suited for bonding shoe soles to shoe uppers in footwear manufacturing. Modern shoe industry employs machines capable of producing large quantities of the necessary shoe parts. Those parts must be joined together to form the final product. In industrial manufacturing processes, joining of shoe parts is often accomplished by adhesive bonding. This step must produce adequate strength bonds in a short time to avoid slowing down the production lines. The most critical bonding operation is the attachment of the shoe uppers to the sole. The sole can be made of a variety of natural or synthetic plastic or elastomeric materials, such as polyvinyl chloride, thermoplastic rubber, styrene butadiene copolymers, and thermoset polyurethanes. The adhesive currently most widely used are solvent solutions of synthetic elastomers, sudh as polychloroprene or polyurethane. The bonding process involves coating the substrates with an adhesive solution, evaporating the solvent, then reactivating the adhesive film by the application of mild heat before assembly. Activation temperatures above about 70 0C must be avoided because they cause distortion of many heat sensitive shoe materials. It would be advantageous to replace the solvent solutions with solvent free adhesives since such adhesives offer not only economic advantages but also operational advantages because the health and fire hazards associated with the presence of solvent vapors are eliminated as also are processes of collecting and disposing of the solvents. Solvent free adhesives are known and are used in other bonding operations. They comprise fluid isocyanateterminated prepolymers that can be chain extended or cured by admixture with di amine curing agents such as methylenedianiline. The combination of curing agent and an isocyanate terminated prepolymer should have adequate potlife after mixing but sufficiently high reaction rate for continuous line applications. Unmodified methylenedianiline, when used with typical urethane prepolymers, gives adhesives having too short a potlife to be applicable in sole attaching operations. A complex of methylenefianiline with sodium chloride in a mole ratio of 3 1 is a known curing agent for urethane prepolymers. A typical dispersion of this complex is available from E.I. du Pont de Nemours Co.,Wilmington, Delaware, United States of America, under the name Caytur 21 . Mixtures of Caytur 21 with urethane prepolymers have a very long potlife but are slow to cure 0 unless activated at temperatures above 120 C, that would destroy many typical shoe materials. The activation temperature of methylenedianiline sodium chloride complexes can be reduced to about 900C by addition of certain active hydrogen compounds including urea, according to the teachings of U.S. 3,891,606, but this is still too high a temperature for most shoe materials.Therefore, a polyurethane based adhesive capable of producing in a short time and at a moderate temperature bonds having good strength is greatly needed. We have now produced a polyurethane prepolymer which is isocyanate terminated and which can be formulated into an adhesive Composition. Such adhesive compositions may be formulated solvent free and, moreover, 0 can be cured at a temperature of about 70 C which is a sufficiently low temperature as not to give rise to damage to shoe materials when the adhesive is used in footwear manufacturing operations. The essence of our invention lies in the formation of the polyurethane prepolymer by reaction of tolylene diisocyanate with a mixture of a poly tetramethyleneoxy glycol and a poly ethyleneoxy compound. In particular the invention provides a curable polyurethane prepolymer formed by reaction of tolylene diisocyanate and a polyalkylene oxide characterised in that from 1.2 2.0 moles of tolylene diisocyanate containing at least 65 of the 2,4 isomer are reacted with 1 mole of poly tetramethyleneoxy glycol having a number average molecular weight of about 400 3000, and a poly ethyleneoxy compound having a number average molecular weight of about 310 4000 and containing 7 30 CH2 CH2O groups and 1 or 2 hydroxyl groups, its CH2 CH2O groups providing 0.5 4.0 of the combined weight of the poly ethyleneoxy compound and poly tetramethyleneoxy glycol, while the poly tetramethyleneoxy glycol provides no less than 80 of said combined weight. A mixture of a methylenedianiline sodium chloride complex with finely ground urea can be used as the curing agent for the isocyanate terminated prepolymer in accordance with the invention to form an adhesive suitable for shoe sole attaching operatings. The adhesive bond forms fast and has 0 high strength. A curing temperature of about 70 C does not damage the usual shoe sole materials or deform the molded shoe bottoms. The isocyanate terminated prepolymer can be readily made by those skilled in the art. Preparation of prepolymers of the present invention will suitably follow the teachings of U.S. Patents 2,929,800 to Hill and U.S.3,755,261 to Van Gulick modified by the incorporation of the poly ethyleneoxy compound. rThe order of addition of the ingredients is not critical. The preferred proportion of the poly ethyleneoxy compound is such that its CH2 CH2 0 groups provide 1.0 to 3.0 of the combined weight of poly ethyleneoxy compound and poly tetramethyleneoxy glycol. It is critical for the success of this inven tion that the prepolymers be based on a poly tetra methvleneoxy glycol, which must constitute at least 80 of the combined weight of poly ethyleneoxy com pound and poly tetramethyleneoxy glycol. Poly ethyleneoxy glycols and polyester glycols, for example, have been found to produce inferior results. The poly ethyleneoxy compound is the product of addition of ethylene oxide to a suitable compound having one or two active hydrogens. Representative starting materials from which the poly ethyleneoxy compounds of this invention are prepared include, for example, the following. A. Alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, butanol, octanol, decanol, dodecanol, octadecanol and cyclohexanol. B. Diols such as ethylene glycol, butanediol, hexane diol, cyclohexanediol, diethylene glycol, dipropy lene glycol and poly propyleneoxy glycols. C. Phenols such as phenol, cresol, naphthol, octyl phenol, nonylphenol and dodecylphenol. D. Monocarboxylic acids such as acetic, butyric, lauric, palmitic, stearic and benzoic acids. E. Dicarboxylic acids such as succinic, glutaric, sebacic, dodecanedioic, isophthalic and tere phthalic acids. F. Amides of any monocarboxylic acids of the type described under D, above. G. Mercaptans and thiophenols such as butyl mercaptan, dodecylmercaptan, and thiophenol. The preferred poly ethyler.esxy compounds are the readily available and highly effective oxyethylated alcohols, phenols, and diols for example, octylphenoxypoly ethyleneoxy ethanols, nonylphenoxypoly ethyleneoxy ethanols, poly ethyleneoxy glycol, and oxyethylated poly propyleneoxy glycols. Because of their basic character, which may adversely affect the stability of the adhesive compositions of the present invention, amines are not suitable starting materials. The ethylene oxide reaction products will have repeating units CH2 CH2 C . Some commercial products suitable in the practice of the present invention are made by adding both ethylene oxide and propylene oxide to the base compound having one or two active hydrogens. Usually, these alkylene oxide adducts contain both poly ethyleneoxy and poly propyleneoxy blocks. For the purpose of this invention, the number of propyleneoxy units is not critical, so long as the total number of ethyleneoxy groups CH2 CH2 O in the molecule is within the 7 30 range, the total molecular weight is no more than 4000, and the mole ratio of ethyleneoxy units to propyleneoxy units is not less than 0.2. Commercial products suitable in the practice by the present invention are available from several sources under trade names such as, for example, Pluronic , BASF Wyandotte Corp., and Triton , Rohm and Haas. Other suitable poly ethyleneoxy compounds can be made, for example, according to the process described in U.S. Patent 2,674,619. The methylenedianiline sodium chloride complex usually is sold as a dispersion in an inert liquid. Such dispersions can be prepared following the general procedure of U.S. 3,876,604 to Caruso et al .Finely powdered urea is best added to methylenedianiline sodium chloride complex as a dispersion. The Rça,dispersion can be made by ball milling urea with an inert liquid of U.S. 3,876,604 until proper particle size is obtained usually, less than 20 microns . The amount of urea used should be 2 5 parts per 100 parts by weight of complex. The proportion of the methylenedianiline sodium chloride complex to the prepolymer is such that the amine NH2 NCO mole ratio is about 0.95 1 to 1.50 1, ratios of 1.00 1 to 1.30 1 being preferred.Below 0.9, the bond development is too slow. for most industrial applications, while above 1.50 the ultimate bond strength is often too low. It is interesting to note that the compositions of the present invention can be used not only as heat activated adhesives but also as casting or liquid injection molding compositions.Should the present system be used for casting or molding, rather than as an adhesive, the lower limit of the NH2 NCO range can be as low as 0.70, the preferred range being 0.85 1.20. Within the preferred range, cured articles having best physical properties are obtained. In the practice of the present invention, the adhesive is used as a two part system. The isocyanateterminated prepolymer which contains the poly ethyleneoxy compound is mixed with the curing agent shortly before use. The composition has at room temperature a potlife in excess of 8 hours preferred compositions, in excess of 24 hours. The adhesive is applied by suitable means such as brushing, doctoring or transfer coating onto one or both surfaces which are to be bonded the adhesive surface or surfaces are heated to initiate reaction, and the parts joined in a press for at least 10 seconds. The bonded assembly is sufficiently strong to be subjected to the remaiBigg steps of footwear finishing. The strength of the bond increases with time, approaching its maimimLthin several hours after bonding. The adhesive composition of the present invention can be also used, if desired, in other applications, including those where parts to be joined are coated with the adhesive composition, assembled together, and then heated to full cure. Such applications require, of course, heat stable parts to be joined. This invention is now illustrated by the following examples of certain representative embodiments thereof, wherein all parts, proportions, and percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated. EXAMPLE 1 To 100 g of an isocyanate terminated Prepolymer A containing 4.1 free isocyanate groups prepared by a reaction of 1.0 mole poly tetramethyleneoxy glycol of molecular weight 1000 with 1.6 moles of 2,4tolylene diisocyanate for 3 hours at 800C is added 3.25 g of octylphenoxypoly ethyleneoxy ethanol having an average molecular weight of about 756 and a poly ethyleneoxy block of 12 13 CH2 CH2O units. These proportions provide a CH2 CH2O content of 2.93 by weight and a poly tetramethyleneoxy glycol content of 97.1 based on the total weight of poly ethyleneoxy compound and poly tetramethyleneoxy glycol. After 3 days at 250C, the resulting reaction product Prepolymer B contains 3.7 free isocyanate groups. Both Prepolymer A and Prepolymer B are made into adhesives by combining with either curing agent C consisting of a 1 1 dispersion of methylenedianiline sodium chloride complex in di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate or curing agent D which is prepared by adding 4.5 parts pdlr 100 parts of curing agent C of a 50 dispersion of finely divided urea in di 2 ethylhexyl azelate. The proportions used are as follows a Prepolymer A 100 parts Curing Agent C 26.7 parts b Prepolymer B 100 parts Curing Agent C 25.6 parts c Prepolymer A 100 parts Curing Agent D 27.9 parts d Prepolymer B 100 parts Curing Agent D 26.7 parts All four adhesive compositions are still workable 24 hours after preparation. The four compositions are used as adhesives by coating 5 mils 0.13 mm of the adhesive on roughed 0.3 cm thick slabs of cured styrene butadiene copolymer. The slabs are immediately heated by radiant heat using a CompoIndustries, Inc. 220 volt adhesive activator so that the adhesive reaches a surface temperature of 730C. Immediately after heating, the adhesive coating is placed in contact with the vinyl surface of a vinylcoated fabric containing about 30 dioctyl phthalate as a plasticizer in the vinyl coating and the combined assembly is pressed at 0.41 MPa for 20 sec. The combined pieces are then peel tested as described inASTM D2558 69 section 8.1 at a jaw separation rate of 5 cm min. The results are shown in the following table Peel Strength, kN m With Curing Agent C 1 Min After Release 3 Hrs After ReleasePrepolymer from Press from Press A 0.02 0.02 B 0.2 3.0Peel Strength, kN m With Curing Agent D 1 Min After Release 3 Hrs After ReleasePrepolymer from Press from Press A 0.2 1.6 B 1.1 5.8 The above results show the improved bonding performance of the modified Prepolymer B with both curing agents.When Prepolymer B is used.with curing agent D, the resulting adhesive gives high strength bonds. Similar results are obtained using chemically equivalent amounts of nonylphenoxypoly ethyleneoxy ethanols having number average molecular weights of 600 900. EXAMPLE 2 To 100 g of Prepolymer A used in Example 1 is added 6.05 g of an Ïxyethylated poly propyleneoxy glycol derived by end tapping poly propyleneoxy glycol with poly ethyleneoxy groups. The glycol has an average molecular weight of 2750 and contains about 25 by weight of ethyleneoxy units, which corresponds to 16 ethyleneoxy units total. For this composition the CH2 CH2O fraction is 1.84 and the poly tetramethyleneoxy glycol content is 92.8 of the combined weight of both glycols. After standing for 3 days at 250C, the resulting Prepolymer E contains 3.6 free isocyanate groups. The results of adhesion tests using the procedure and curing agent D from Example 1 are shown below.

EXAMPLE 5 A series of four modified prepolymers were prepared by the procedure of Example 1 by adding increasing amounts of an oxyethylated poly propyleneoxy glycol derived by end capping poly propyleneoxy glycol with poly ethyleneoxy units to 100 g portions of Prepolymer A. The oxyethylated poly propyleneoxy glycol had a molecular weight of about 2650 daSd containted about 30 by weight of CH2 CH2O units. The modified prepolymers were made into adhesives by the addition of curing agent D. The resulting adhesives were evaluated by bonding slabs of styrene butadiene copolymer to vinyl coated fabric as described inExample 1. The pot life of the adhesives was determined by measuring their viscosities 8 hours and 24 hours after preparation. Proportions and test results are presented in the following table along with results for a control adhesive to which no polyethyleneoxy compound was added.

Too viscous to measure. The results show that the addition of po1y ethyleneoxy compound increases peel strength. However, in preparation 5 D where the level of poly ethyleneoxy compound was high enough to provide 5 ethyleneoxy units and to reduce the concentration of poly tetramethyleneoxy glycol below 80 , the adhesive was too viscous for use. Preparation 5 D is outside the limits of this application. EXAMPLE 6 Three prepolymers were prepared by the procedure used for Prepolymer A of Example 1 with the exception that poly tetramethyleneoxy glycol MW 1000 was replaced by an equal weight ofA. poly ethylene adipate glycol MW 1000 ,B. poly ethyleneoxy glycol MW 1000 , orC. poly l,2 propyleneoxy glycol MW 1000 . Prepolymers A and B were made into adhesive compositions by the addition of 27.9 parts of curing agent D per 100 parts of prepolymer. In less than 8 hours both of these adhesive compositions became too viscous for use. A portion of Prepolymer C was modified by the addition of 3.25 g of octylphenoxypoly ethyleneoxy ethanol having an average molecular weight of 756 following the procedure of Example 1 to form a prepolymer designated as Prepolymer C . Prepolymers C and were converted to adhesives by the addition of 27.9 and 26.7 parts per 100 parts prepolymer, respectively, o curing agent D. The resulting adhesives were tested by bonding styrene butadiene copolymer and vinyl coated fabric as in Example 1. Peel strengths 1 minute after release from the press were less than 0.02 kN m which is inadequate for use as a shoe adhesive. None of the above preparations is within the scope of this application. They are provided to illustrate the criticality of using poly tetramethyleneoxy glycol in preparing the present ad hesives.
