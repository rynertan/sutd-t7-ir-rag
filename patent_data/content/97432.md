# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PERITONEAL DIALYSIS

## Abstract
There is provided a dialysis apparatus which includes first means for supplying dialysis fluid, second means for receiving, heating and weighing dialysis fluid, third means for receiving and weighing a quantity of dialysis fluid, a catheter, and structure which supports the first means above the second means, the second means above the catheter, and the third means below the catheter. A first flow path interconnects the first and second means, while a second flow path interconnects the second means in the catheter. A third flow path interconnects the catheter in the third means. Valve means are provided for selectively i blocking the first and third paths while leaving the second path open, ii blocking the second and third paths while leaving the first path open, and iii blocking the second path while leaving the first and third paths open. A timer computer is provided which is able to maintain mode i until a preselected reduction in weight occurs at the second means, following which it switches to and maintains mode ii , following which it switches to and maintains mode iii .
