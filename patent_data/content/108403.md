## Description
Background Of The Invention The present invention relates to a method and reagents for determining ligands in biological fluids such as serum, plasma, spinal fluid, amnionic fluid and urine.In particular, the present invention relates to a fluorescence polarization immunoassay procedure and to tracers employed as reagents in such procedures. The fluorescence polarization immunoassay techniques combine the specificity of an immunoassay with the speed and convenience of fluorescence polarization techniques to provide a means for determining the amount of a specific ligand present in a sample. Competitive binding immunoassays for measuring ligands are based on the competition between a ligand in a test sample and a labeled reagent, referred to as a tracer, for a limited number of receptor binding sites on antibodies specific to the ligand and tracer The concentration of ligand in the sample determines the amount of tracer that will specifically bind to an antibody The amount of tracerantibody conjugate produced may be quantitively measured and is inversely proportional to the quantity of ligand in the test sample. In general, fluorescence polarization techniques are based on the principle that a fluorescent labeled compound when excited by linearly polarized light will emit fluorescence having a degree of polarization inversely related to its rate of rotation. Therefore, when a molecule such as a tracerantibody conjugate having a fluorescent label is excited with linearly polarized light, the emitted light remains highly polarized because the fluorophore is constrained from rotating between the time light is absorbed and emitted. When a free tracer compound its,, unbound to an antibody is excited by linearly polarized light, its rotation is much faster than the corresponding tracer antibody conjugate and the molecules are more randomly oriented, therefore, the emitted light is depolarized.Thus, fluorescence polariz ation provides a quantitive means for measuring the amount of tracer antibody conjugate produced in a competitive binding immunoassay, Various fluorescent labeled compounds are known in the art. U. S. Patent No. 3,998,943 describes the preparation of a fluorescently labeled insulin derivative using fluorescein isothiocyanate FITC as the fluorescent label and a fluorescently labeled morphine derivative using 4 aminofluorescein hydrochloride as the fluorescent label.Carboxyfluorescein has also been used for analytical determinations. R. C. Chen, AnaZytacaZ Letters, 10, 787 1977 describes the use of carboxyfluorescein to indicate the activity of phospholipase. The carboxyfluorescein as described is encapsulated in lecithin liposomes, and it will fluoresce only when released by the hydrolysis of lecithin. Ut S.application Serial Number 329,974, filed December 11, 1981, discloses a class of carboxyfluorescein derivatives useful as reagents in fluorescent polarization immunoassays wherein the carboxyfluorescein is directly bonded to a ligand analog.Summary Of The Invention The present invention encompasses a method for determining ligands in a sample comprising intermixing with said sample a biologically acceptable salt of a tracer of the formula EMI2.1 wherein T is aEMI3.1 group wherein n is an integer of from 1 to 8 and wherein R is a ligand analog having a reactive carbonyl group which is attached to the amino nitrogen of the groups represented by T wherein said ligand analog has at least one common epitope with said ligand so as to be specifically recognizable by a common antibody and an antibody capable of specifically recognizing said ligand and said tracer, and then determining the amount of tracer antibody conjugate by fluorescence polarization techniques as a measure of the concentration of said ligand in the sample. The invention further relates to certain noyel tracers and biologically acceptable salts thereof, which are useful in reagents in the above described method.Detailed Description Of The Invention The term ligand 6 as used herein refers to a molecule, in particular a low molecular weight hapten having a single reactive amino group, to which a binding protein, normally an antibody, can be obtained or formed Such haptens are protein free bodies, generally of low molecular weight that do not induce antibody formation when injected into an animal, but are reactive to antibodies, Antibodies to hapten are generally raised by first conjugating the haptens to a protein and injecting the conjugate product into an animal,The resulting antibodies are isolated by conventional antibody isolation techniques, Ligands determinable by the method of the present invention vary over a wide molecular weight range.Although high molecular weight ligands may be determined, for best results, it is generally preferable to employ the methods of the present invention to determine ligands of low molecular weight, generally in a range of 50 to 4000. It is more preferred to determine ligands having a molecular weight in a range of 100 to 2000. Representative of ligands having a reactive carbonyl group determinable by the methods of the present invention include steroids such as esterone, estradiol, cortisol, testoestrone, progesterone, chenodeoxycholic acid, digoxin, cholic acid, digitoxin, deoxycholic acid, lithocholic acids and the ester and amide derivatives thereof vitamins such asB 12, folic acid thyroxine, triiodothyronine, histamine, serotonin, prostaglandins such as PGE, PGF, PGA antiasthmatic drugs such as theophylline, antineoplastic drugs such as doxorubicin and methotrexate antiarrhythmic drugs such as disopyramide, lidocaine, procainamide, propranolol, quinidine,N acetyl procainamide anticonvulsant drugs such as phenobarbital, phenyton, primidone, valproic acid, carbamazepine and ethosuximide antibiotics such as penicillins, cephalosporins and vancomycin, antiarthritic drugs such as salicylate antidepressant drugs including tricyclics such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, imipramine and desipramine and the like as well as the metabolites thereof Additional ligands that may be determined by the methods of the present invention include drugs of abuse such as morphine, heroin, hydromorphone, oxymorphone, metapon, codeine, hydrocodone dihydrocodeine, dihydrohydroxy, codeinone, pholcodine, dextromethorphan, phenazocine and deonin and their metabolites The tracers of the present invention generally exist in an equilibrium between their acid and ionized states, and in the ionized state are effective in the method of the present invention Therefore, the present invention comprises the tracers in either the acid or ionized state and for convenience, the tracers of the present invention are structurally represented herein in their acid form. When the tracers of the present invention are present in their ionized state, the tracers exist in the form of biologically acceptable salts.As used herein, the term biologically acceptable salts refers to salts such as sodium, potassium, ammonium and the like which will enable the tracers of the present invention to exist in their ionized state when employed in the method of the present invention, Generally, the tracers of the present invention exist in solution as salts, the specific salt results from the buffer employed, i.e., in the presence of a sodium phosphate buffer, the tracers of the present invention will generally exist in their ionized state as a sodium salt The term ligand analog as used herein refers to a mono or polyvalent radical ,a substantial proportion of which has the same spatial and polar organization as the ligand to define one or more determinant or epitopic sites capable of competing with the ligand for the binding sites of a receptor.A characteristic of such ligand analog is that it possesses sufficient structural similarity to the ligand of interest so as to be recognized by the antibody for the ligandt For the most part, the ligand analog will have the same or substantially the same structure and charge.distribution spatial and polar organization as the ligand of interest for a significant portion of the molecular surface. Since frequently, the linking site for a hapten will be the same in preparing the antigen for. production of antibodies as used for linking to the ligand, the same portion of the ligand analog which provides the template for the antibody will be exposed by the ligand analog in the tracer. In general, the group represented by R may be characterized as ligands or ligand analogs functionalized via a carboxyl, sulfonyl, or alkylhalo rtoietv which produces an amide or amine linkage with an amino nitrogen in the groups represented by T. In accordance with the method of the present invention, a sample containing the ligand to he determined is intermixed with a biologically acceptable salt of a tracer of formula I and an antibody specific for the ligand and tracer The ligand present in the sample and the tracer compete for limiting antibody sites resulting in the formation of ligand antibody and tracer antibody complexesBy maintaining constant the concentration of tracer and antibody, the ratio of ligandantibody complex to tracerantibody complex that is formed is directly proportional to the amount of ligand present in the sample.Therefore, upon exciting the mixture with polarized light and measuring the polarization of the fluorescence emitted by a tracer and a tracer antibody complex, one is able to quantitatively determine the amount of ligand in the sample, In theory, the fluorescence polarization of a tracer not complexed to an antibody is low, approaching zero. Upon complexing with a specific antibody, the tracer antibody complex thus formed assumes the rotation of the antibody molecule which is slower than that of the relatively small tracer molecule, thereby increasing the polarization observed Therefore, when a ligand competes with the tracer for antibody sites, the observed polarization of fluorescence of the tracer antibody complex becomes a value somewhere between that of the tracer and tracer antibody complex.If a sample contains a high concentration of the ligand, the observed polarization value is closer to that of the free ligand, i.e., low. If the test sample contains a low concentration of the ligand, the polarization value is closer to that of the bound ligand, i.e., highv By sequentially exciting the reaction mixture of an immunoassay with vertically and then horizontally polarized light and analyzing only the vertical component of the emitted light, the polarization of fluorescence in the reaction mix may be accurately determined.The precise relationship between polarization and concentration of theligand to be determined is established by measuring the polarization values of calibators with known concentrations The concentration of the ligand can be extrapolated from a standard curve prepared in this manner, The pH at which the method of the present invention is practiced must be sufficient to allow the tracers of formula CI to exist in their ionized state. The pH may range from about 3 to 12, more usually in the range of from about 5 to 10, most preferably from about 6 to 9. Various buffers may be used to achieve and maintain the pH during the assay procedure.Representative buffers include borate, phosphate, carbonate, tris, barbital and the like, The particular buffer employed is not critical to the present invention, but in an individual assay, a specific buffer may be preferred in view of the antibody employed and ligand to be determined. The cation portion of the buffer will generally determine the cation portion of the tracer salt in solution. The methods of the present invention are practiced at moderate temperatures and preferably at a constant temperature. The temperature will normally range from about 0 to 500 C, more usually from about 15µ to 400 C. The concentration of ligand which may be assayed 2 13 will generally vary from about 16 to 10 M, more usually from about 10 to 10 10M High concentrations of ligand may be assayed upon dilution of the original sample. In addition to the concentratic range of ligand of interest, considerations such as whether the assay is qualitative, semiquantitative or quantitative, the equipment employed, and the characteristics of the tracer and antibody will normally determine the concentration of the tracer and antibody to be employed. While the concentration of ligand in the sample will determine the range of concentration of the other reagents, i.e,, tracer and antibody, normally to optimize the sensitivity of the assay, individual reagent concentrations will be determined empirically. Concentrations of the tracer and antibody are readily ascertained by one of ordinary skill in the art. The preferred tracers of the present invention are characterized as derivatives of 5 carboxyfluorescein or 6 carboxyfluorescein or mixtures thereof and are represented by the formulas EMI8.1 EMI9.1 The following illustrative, nonlimiting examples will serve to further demonstrate to those skilled in the art the manner in which specific tracers within the scope of this invention may be prepared.
