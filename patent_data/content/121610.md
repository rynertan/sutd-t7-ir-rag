# Coupling system, especially for a connector.

## Abstract
A hermaphroditic coupling system, especially for an optical fibre or electrical connector member. The connec tor member 10 has a body 12 with a cylindrical portion 14 and a semi cylindrical extension 16 , defining a step ped end profile comprising rearward and forward spaced parallel semi annular transverse surfaces 24, 26 and a planar portion 22 between them, this structure having 180 rotational symmetry about a transverse axis 56 . A channel 20 is formed in the extension 16 as a continuation of a bore 18 in the portion 14 forming a recess. A boss 32 is in the channel 20 and has a projecting end 34 project ing forwardly of surface 26 . A domed abutment surface 44 on an abutment member 42 resiliently mounted by a spring 40 at the rear of the boss faces rearwardly towards the bore 18 . The space 50 between the boss 32 and the end surface 24 of the body portion 14 is sufficient to receive laterally the boss on an opposed identical connector mem ber 58 when the abutment members are depressed. When the connectors are axially aligned they move together lon gitudinally under the action of the springs 40 to engage the projecting end 34 of the boss 32 in the end of the bore 18 . The connector member is of simple construction and can provide both a snap in and a snatch release capability.
