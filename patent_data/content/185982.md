# Reagent test device.

## Abstract
Independent reagent matrix zones are created in hyd rophobic open celled natural or synthetic material by heating the open celled material along parallel lines at right angles to the length of a reagent test device so as to seal the material at predetermined intervals and thereby form separate rea gent matrix areas on the same reagent test device. This technique results in a reagent test device which eliminates the runover problem which has caused cross contamination between reagent areas and resulted in the failure of reagent test devices to perform properly.
