## Abstract
In a system for controlling a tracking position of a rotary head for a VTR which has a rotary head including an audio 1 and video heads 13 , the existence of an audio signal reproduced by the audio head 1 is detected and the tracking control is carried out on the basis of either the level of said audio FM signal when it exists or the level of a video FM signal reproduced by the video head 13 when the audio FM signal does not exist.
