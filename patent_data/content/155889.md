# REDUCED CALORIE BAKED GOODS AND METHODS FOR PRODUCING SAME

## Abstract
Reduced calorie cookies having a pH of from about 6.8 to about 9.0 exhibit the desirable texture, mouth feel and appearance of conventional cookies. An alkaline agent and a leavening system which is predominantly active during baking are used to control pH and textures of the cookies. The cookies are produced from cookies doughs comprising a from about 10 to about 30 flour, b from about 0 to about 15 shortening or fat, c from about 5 to about 20 of at least one sugar, d from about 5 to about 20 of a water soluble polydextrose on a dry weight basis, e from about 0 to about 10 of at least one emulsifier, f from about 0,50 to about 3 of a leavening system and g from about 4 to about 15 of a cellulosic bulking agent.
