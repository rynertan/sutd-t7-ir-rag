# Pasta machine.

## Abstract
A pasta machine has an L shaped base formed with an extruder seat and provided internally with a gear transmission having an input projecting in one direction from the base, and mixer and extruder outputs projecting in the opposite direction. An extruder body has an extruder chamber provided internally with an auger and is formed with a window opening radially into the extruder chamber. A mixer body has a mixing chamber secured to the extruder body and communicating with the extruder chamber through the window. This mixer body is provided internally with a mixing rotor that extends along and is rotatable about a mixer axis parallel to the extruder axis, and with a lid engageable over and closing the mixer body. The extruder body can be releasably interfitted with the extruder seat so as to fit the auger with the extruder output of the transmission and to fit the rotor with the mixer output of the transmission.
