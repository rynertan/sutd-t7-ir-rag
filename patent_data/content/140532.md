# Apparatus for manufacturing resin impregnated fiber braided products.

## Abstract
A braid wrapping wheel or carrier 24 bearing rotatable spools 28 of filaments 32 is mounted for rotation concen trically about a mandrel 22 , to produce braiding of the filaments 32 about the mandrel 22 in the usual way as a result of carrier 24 rotation and axial shifting of the mandrel 22 along its axis. The improvement lies in a pair of fixed angular guide rings 36, 38 concentric about the mandrel 22 and each partially defining a closed plenum chamber 42 bearing a liquid resin R under pressure. The resin R is fed through fine pores 56 within the ring 36, 38 walls over which the filaments pass to impregnate the filaments. By control of the pressure of the liquid R a bead of liquid is maintained at each pore 56 for wiping by the filament 32 during passage, the pressure being insufficient to cause the resin to bleed from the plenum chamber via the pores 56 during filament stoppage or absent the presence of filaments 32 . One or more soft rubber scrapers 66 wipe excess resin off the filaments 32 and press the filaments 32 against the mandrel. Alternatively, a number of atomizing nozzles 90 spaced around guide rings 80 may apply the resin R by production of a wet fog whose resin droplets quickly wet out the fibers 32 without impinging on the fibers at high velocity.
