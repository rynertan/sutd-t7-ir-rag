# Multiple access bus communications system.

## Abstract
A multiple access digital communications system comprises a plurality of remotely located terminals coupled to a communications bus including a pair of oppositely directed, unidirectional signal paths 10, 12 and a unidirectional path coupler 14 for transferring signals from the inbound path 10 to the outbound path 12 . To send a message from one terminal to another desired terminal, a corresponding bus interface unit 20A coupled to both the inbound and outbound paths 10, 12 is adapted to perform an rf. carrier sensing operation to determine as to whether or not any other subscriber is transmitting on the inbound path 10 . If no carrier is detected, the bus interface unit 20A confirms this determination by first beginning to transmit a message packet and then monitoring the outbound path 12 during a collision window. If the transmitted message is received intact within this collision window, the bus interface unit 20A may transmit any remaining portion of its message packet on the inbound path 10 .
