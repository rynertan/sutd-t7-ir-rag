# Sheet feeding device.

## Abstract
In a sheet feeding device for separating one sheet at a time from a stack of sheets 1 piled on a sheet feed tray 3 for feeding same to the next processing station, the distance L between a point 18 at which feeding means 4 for exerting a sheet feeding force on the uppermost sheet 1 a of the stack of sheets 1 piled on the sheet feed tray 3 is brought into contact therewith and a point 19 at which separating means 5, 6 for offering resistance to the sheets 1 for separating them is brought into contact with the sheets 1 fed by the feeding means 4 or the relation between such distance L and a pressing force W exerted by the pressing means 2 to urge the stack of sheets 1 against the feeding means 4 is set in a range causing no buckling of the sheets 1 to occur between the feeding means 4 and the separating means 5, 6 during sheet feeding.
