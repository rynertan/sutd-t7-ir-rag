# Method and apparatus for separating from excavated materials the fine and coarse constituents thereof.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a method of separating from excavated materials 2 fine constituents 3 , preferably topsoil, and coarse constituents 4 , preferably stones, roots or root crops, in which the materials to be excavated 2 are excavated by an excavating and separating bucket 11 of grid structure, which is subjected to separating movements to cause the fines 3 to escape from the excavating and separating bucket 11 through apertures provided for that purpose. To produce shock free separating movements said method is characterized in that the excavating and separat ing bucket 11 is rotated continuously through one or preferably a plurality of revolutions in the same direction of rotation R . A simple apparatus for carrying the method of the invention into effect is characterized in that the excavating and separating bucket 11 is comprised in a unit 5 provided with connecting means 7 to permit connection of the unit 5 to an excavating and elevating assembly 8 on a vehicle 9 . Furthermore, the unit 5 comprises a rotation assembly 10 to rotate the excavating and separating bucket 11 continuously through one or preferably more revolutions in the same direction of rotation R to produce shock free separating movements, and the excavating and separating bucket 11 has one or more, preferably four, pockets which are adapted to elevate the excavated materials 2 contained in the excavating and separating bucket 11 at every revolution and let them down again into the lowermost portions of the excavating and separating bucket 11 .
