## Description
SKI TROUSERS WITH ELASTIC WAISTBAND The present invention relates to improved ski trousers particularly to ski trousers wherein the top portion thereof is formed by an elastic waistband having an height of at least 6 cm. In the practice of skiing it is known that the vertebrae of skiers, especially those near the pelvis, represent one of the most stressed zones easily subjected to overfatigue or even to the risk of more serious incon veniences. Because of this, skiers, especially those practicing agonistic activity, resort, ever more often, to use of wear elastic belts and waistbands of the traditional kind. Nevertheless the use thereof gives rise to other nuisances due, for example, to the curling of the edges of such elastic waistbands, to their tenden cy to shift during use etc. It is an object of the present invention to provide a new type of ski trousers which offers to the skier the desired waist support without the inconveniences arising from the use of traditional elastic waistbands.Such an object is achieved, in accordance with the present invention, by making the top portion of the trousers, that is, that near the waist line, with a suitable elastic material having elasticity in the circumferential directior and a height of at least 6 cm, and more preferably comprised between 9 and 18 cm. Ski trousers in accordance with the present invention offer the advantage, besides that of supporting the waist of the skier, of improving the thermal conditions of the part of the body concerned. These and other advan tages of the trousers according to the present invention will become clear to the expert in the field through the following detailed description of one embodiment thereof making reference to the drawing which shows a schematic view of the trousers according to the present invention. With reference to the appended Figure, it is observed that ski trousers 1, which may be made either with elastic fabric or with other type of fabric, have their top portion, that is the portion comprised between the edge of the hip pocket 2 and the rim of the trousers, made entirely with elastic material having elasticity in the circumferential direction which forms a kind of waistband 3. The height of such a band is at least 6 cm, however it is preferably comprised between 9 and 18 cm. A suitable elastic material for making the band 3 is for example the material used to make elastic belts for motorcyclists. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, on the waistband 3 there are at least three non elastic stiffeners 4, 5 and 6. Such stiffeners, besides effective ly preventing curling of the waistband 3, co operate to improve the general comfort of the wearer. The material suitable for such stiffeners must possess a certain rigidity together with a sufficient flexibility in the longitudinal sense thereof. Such flexibility is preferably greater for the stiffeners 4 and 5 such as not to disturb the front wise bendings of the skier. Such stiffeners may be made with suitable mixtures of rubber or plastics. The top portion of stiffeners 4, 5 and 6 may advantageously be shaped as to provide firm anchoring points for suspenders.
