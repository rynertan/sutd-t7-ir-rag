# Improvements in mechanical seals.

## Abstract
In a mechanical seal 16 , seal face member 30 is compressed by a shrink fitted squeeze ring 28 onto a spigot 27 of a carrier 26 forming one of two seal elements 22, 18 . This arrangement reduces distortion of seal face 32 and shrouds the seal member 30 from attack by fluid product in space 14 . Distortion of seal face 32 is further discouraged by also shrink fitting the squeeze ring 28 onto the carrier 26. The squeeze ring 28 circumferentially abuts the face seal member 30 and either radially or circumferentially abuts the carrier 26 to provide structural stability and to shroud the face seal member 30 on three sides leaving only the seal face exposed. The squeeze ring can be arranged internally of the seal face member with the spigot on the carrier arranged externally. In either event the seal face member, usually constructed from carbon is held under radial compression for increased strength.
