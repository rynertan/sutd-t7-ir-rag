# IMPROVED EFFICACY OF FUNGICIDES FOR WOOD TREATMENT BY THE ADDITION OF CHLORPYRIFOS

## Abstract
Fungicidal compositions containing a mixture of 0,0 diethyl 0 3,5,6 trichloro 2 pyridyl phosphorothioate and a toxicant selected from the group consisting of 2,3,5,6 tetrachloro 4 methylsulfonyl pyridine, pentachlorophenol, Protek T , N trichloromethylthio phthalimide, cis N 1,1,2,2, tetrachloroethyl thio 4 cyclohexene 1,2 dicarboximide, 3 iodo 2 propynyl butyl carbamate and 2,4,5,6 tetrachloroisophthalonitrile, and an inert carrier are disclosed. Such compositions are useful in protecting wood from fungus organisms, it having been found that the mixture of toxic ingredients of the compositions is syner gistic.
