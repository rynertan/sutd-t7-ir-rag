# Percussion envelope generator for an electronic musical instrument.

## Abstract
A circuit for generating a percussion envelope for use in electronic organs and similar electronic keyboard instru ments wherein the envelope has an attack overshoot, a long decay, and a snub decay when the key is released. A velocity sensing feature 74 is included, whereby the force with which the key is struck determines the amount of capacitor dis charge, and the voltage remaining on the capacitor 82 is compared with the amplitude of the attack portion of the envelope in a first comparator 130 such that decay is initi ated when a compare condition is reached. A second com parator 138 sets the amplitude at which the envelope under goes transition from a fast decay to the normal long decay. The timing for the attack and three decay portions of the envelope are independently controlled by means of four clock driven electronic gate circuits 50, 52, 56, 60 which incremen tally charge and discharge the main timing capacitor 62 . The gate circuits 50, 52, 56, 60 include a pair of serially connected field effect transistors 92,94 having a capacitor 98 con nected at their juncture. The timing control for each individual keyer, including all of the timing capacitors, is contained within a separate LSI chip 101 .
