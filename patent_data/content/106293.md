# PROCESS FOR POLYMERIZATION OF ACRYLATE OR METHACRYLATE

## Abstract
In a process for polymerizing an acrylate or a methacry late monomer alone, a mixture thereof or a mixture of an acrylate or a methacrylate monomer as a main component and other copolymerizable monomers in the presence of water, an emulsifiers and a polymerization initiator soluble in water or the monomers the improvement which comprises carrying out that the polymerization in a polymerization vessel having a film on an inner surface thereof and on surfaces of attached instruments within the vessel, said flm being formed by applying a solution of an aromatic quinone amine compound which is insoluble in water or the monom ers, contains a quinone group and an amine group capable of inhibiting the radical polymerization and contains a functional group having a chelate forming ability for adher ing the compound to the surfaces, and removing the solvent by drying. According to the process, the scale deposition in the polymerization of an acrylate or a methacrylate can be prevented.
