# Power steering gear with oil filled capillary balancing slots.

## Abstract
An integral power steering gear assembly 10 has oil capillary slots 50, 51 fed with high pressure fluid from feed grooves along the sides of the piston 11 adjacent the output rack 18 . The slots 50, 51 are designed to have a shallow depth, providing capillary attraction of the oil molecules. The trapped oil molecules prevent, molecular interaction between the piston 11 and cylinder wall, but at the same time, the oil molecules remain trapped or isolated within the walls of the slots 50, 51 thereby minimizing leakage. The operating oil is delivered in the power steering unit by a bifurcated oil deliv ery passage 31 communicating with the inlet slot 22 of the piston. This provides fluidized balance and cushioning of the valve 20 within the piston, and also prevents starvation of the high pressure feed grooves and capillary slots for balanc ing and cushioning the piston 11 within the cylinder 13 .
