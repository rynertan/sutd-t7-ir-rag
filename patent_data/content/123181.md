# Electrooptical device.

## Abstract
An optical apparatus comprises an optical device 10 having an optically functional material 6 sandwiched bet ween a pair of substrates 3 with electrodes 5 formed on opposing surfaces. The optically functional material has such a characteristic that intensity of light issuing from the optical device changes asymmetrically in response to inversion of the polarity of an applied external field. Pulse voltages of one polarity for determining the intensity of the issuing light and pulse voltages of an opposite polarity are applied from a source 8 at a predetermined period T so that an average voltage is zeroed within the predetermined period. The issu ing light intensity under the application of the pulse voltages of one polarity and the issuing light intensity under the appli cation of the other pulse voltages are selected or changed by a switching unit 20 .
