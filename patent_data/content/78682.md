# Wadding materials.

## Abstract
Wadding material comprises a mixture of a blend of 90 10 by weight of staple fibres A having a mono filament fineness of 3 10 deniers and a curliness of not less than 15 and 10 90 by weight of staple fibres B formed of a synthetic polymer and having a monofila ment fineness of 0.7 4 deniers and less than that of the staple fibres A and a curliness of less than 15 , to gether with i up to 100 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the blend of staple fibres A and B , of synthetic fibres comprising a component having a melt ing point which is lower than that of those of staple fibres A and B by more than 20 C ii from 1 50 parts by weight, per hundred parts by weight of the blend of staple fibres A and B of film shaped structural elements C or iii film shaped structural elements C , and up to 100 parts by weight, based on the total weight of the blend of staple fibres A and B and structural elements C , of synthetic fibres comprising a component having a melting point which is lower than those of staple fibres A and B and structural elements C by more than 20 C.
