# THIN FILM FIELD EFFECT TRANSISTOR AND METHOD OF MAKING SAME

## Abstract
There is disclosed a film field effect transistor which can be operated at fast switching rates for use, for example, in video display applications. The transistor includes a body of sil icon semiconductor material having a structure more ordered than amorphous material and less ordered than single crystal line material. The source and drain of the transistor comprise rectifying contacts formed on the body of silicon semiconduc tor material. Also disclosed are a method of making the tran sistor and an electronically addressable array system utilizing the transistor to advantage.
