# Prepolymers prepared from hydroxy aromatic mono aldehydes and methylated pyridines or pyrazines, and composites prepared therefrom.

## Abstract
This invention is directed to cured fibrous composites prepared from the resinous reaction products of hydroxy aromatic mono aldehydes and methylated pyridines or methylated pyrazines. This invention is also directed to thermosettable prepolymers prepared from hydroxy mono aldehydes and methylated pyrazines or pyridines. The total number of methyl groups in the pyridine or pyrazine ranges from 2 to 4. The composites are prepared from conventional fibers such as graphite fibers, glass fibers, aramid fibers, or asbestos fibers.
