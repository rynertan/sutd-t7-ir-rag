# A process of making a coherent rigid solid material.

## Abstract
A method for the production of coherent, rigid solid perlite silicate insulation is described having improved transverse strenght while retaining excellent insulating characteristics. According to a preferred embodiment, such compositions incorporating a limited amount of phosphate is blow moulded into shapes. These shapes are hardened by exposure to carbon dioxide gas and cured by microwave heating to yield improved insulative shapes having improved resistance to shrinkage higher flexural strength and greater insulating properties.
