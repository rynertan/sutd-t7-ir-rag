## Description
Protective helmet without metallic connections for motor and pedal cyclists.This invention relates to protective helmets such are used by motor and pedal cyclists and sportsmen, and an object of the invention is to provide a protective helmet of a type, in accordance with a first aspect of the invention, having an eye shield which is connected to a helmet shell in such a fashion as to render the utilisation of metallic connecting parts unnecessary, and on the other hand in accordance with another aspect of the invention, is provided with a goggle band retention means, preferably at the rear of the helmet, which is connected to the helmet in such a fashion as to render the utilisation of metallic connecting parts unnecessary. In a preferred case, the helmet will be provided both with a eye shield and the goggles band retention means.In general, known protective helmets are provided both with an eye shield and a goggles band retention means, the latter being at the rear of the helmet, such eye shield and goggles band retention means being connected to the helmet shell by metallic parts such as rivets, plates, clips or the like. It has been found that the said metallic parts in due course oxidise and, in the case of iron and steel parts, become rusty, which results in the parts becoming unsightly, becoming weakened, or becoming jammed.In the case of the eye shield which is usually pivotable upwardly from the in use position to an out of use position or is detachable from the shell, if the metallic mounting becomes jammed there is the serious danger to the user that in the event of an accident or impact, if the eye shield receives a blow and does not yield, there may be a high stress on the user s head caused by lever action through the jammed eye shield, with the serious possibility of severe damage to the user s neck or head.On the other hand, if the corrosion of a metallic part leads to weakening of the connection between the eye shield and helmet, the eye shield may become detached permanently, which may render the helmet useless.If the means for holding the goggles band at the rear of the helmet becomes so corroded as to detach permanently from the helmet, then the loss of holding of the goggles band can lead to difficulties in use, if for example the goggles band travels too far up the rear of the helmet or travels down over the bottom edge of the helmet, as the effectiveness of the goggles will be lost.In the known mounting arrangement for the means for retaining the goggles band, strips of different materials fixed to press studs are used. The press studs can be pressed to receiving plates rivetted to the rear of the helmet, and to retain the goggles band, the strips are detached by releasing the press stud, the goggles band is fixed in position, and then the press stud is re fastened.The press studs and rivots are of metallic material and are liable to oxidation and or rusting as they are exposed to the weather.With the arrangement according to the present invention, the abovementioned disadvantages are obviated or mitigated.In accordance with a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a protective helmet having a helmet shell and an eye shield, characterised in that the helmet shell and eye shield are of non metallic material, the eye shield is preferably but not necessarily rotatably mounted on the shell so as to be movable between an operative position and a raised inoperative position, the eye shield and shell being held connected by virtue of the resiliency of the material of the eye shield or the helmet shell or both, whereby, for the holding of the eye shield to the helmet, the use of rivets, screws, press studs or other metallic parts, which are liable to oxidation, corrosion and jamming is not necessary.In accordance with a second aspect of the invention there is provided a protective helmet having a helmet shell and a goggles band clip, characterised in that the helmet shell and goggles band clip are of non metallic material, the goggles band is clipped preferably on the rear of the shell, so as to form a loop preferably at the rear of the helmet for receiving the band of, a pair of goggles worn by the user of the helmet, the goggles clip and shell being held connected by virtue of the resiliency of the material of the goggles clip, or the helmet shell or both, whereby, for the holding of the band clip to the helmet, the use of rivets, screws, press studs or other metallic parts which are liable to oxidation, corrosion and jamming, is not necessary.The non metallic material of the shell, eye shield and or goggles band retention clip, is preferably a stampable elastic synthetic resin or a polyester resin reinforced with glass fibres.The helmet according to the present invention, by arranging for the helmet shell, eye shield and or goggles band retaining clip to be made of non metallic material, and connectable by virtue of the resiliency of material used, ensures the prevention of corrosion and rusting and jamming resulting from corrossion and rusting, whilst yet, in the preferred case, providing the functionality of the eye shield to rotate from its operative to its inoperative position and enabling the ready clipping of the goggles band retention clip, to the helmet shell.The aspects of the present invention are illustrated in an embodiment of each, with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein Fig. 1 is a sectional side view of a helmet according to and embodying the aspects of the present invention Fig. 2 is a front view of the helmet shell of the helmet shown in Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is a an underneath plan view of the eye shield of the helmet shown in Fig. l Fig. 4 is a side view in section and to an enlarged scale of a detail of the helmet shown in Fig. 1 andFig. 5 is a front view of the goggles band retention clip of the helmet shown in Fig. 1.Referring to the drawings, the illustrated helmet comprises a helmet shell 1, an eye shield 2, and a goggles band retention clip 3. Each of these three parts is made of elastic synthetic resin, and the parts are connected by snap fitting together relying on the resiliency of the material used for the parts. The eye shield 2 and clip 3 are capable of being disconnected from and connected to the helmet shell i repeatedly and by snap fitting action, and to this end there are complimentary projections and recesses on the respective parts, which projections and recesses are produced by the method of forming the parts, for example, stamping, moulding or the like. Each of the parts is a one piece item. It can be appreciated therefore that the interconnection of the parts 1, 2 and 3 does not require the use of any metallic means such as rivets or press studs, which could in use corrode, fail or jam.The arrangement which is used for connecting the eye shield 2 to the helmet shell 1, consists in that the helmet shell has at the front above the face aperture, two recesses apertures, loop holes or bores 4 and 5, as best illustrated in Fig. 2, which receive pins 6, 7 as shown in Fig. 3 which are integral parts of the eye shield 2. Additionally, the eye shield is provided at the rear with a hook or clasp portion 8 which is also formed during the manufacture of the eye shield, and in the operative position shown in Fig. 1, the clasp 8 frictionally and resiliently engages the front peripheral edge 1 as shown in Fig. 1, of the helmet shell.The eye shield 2 can be moved against the holding action of the hook 8 to an upper, out of the way and inoperative position, and is still retained connected to the shell 1 by virtue of the pins 6 and 7 engaging recesses 4 and 5 in resilient fashion. As regards the goggles band retention clip 3, which is illustrated in enlarged scale in Figs. 4 and 5, this clip is a substantially U shaped component having inner and outer limbs 3 and 3 of different lengths he expressions inner and outer being applied to the respective positions taken by the limbs 3 and 3 when the clip is clipped to the helmet shell as shown in Figs.1 and 4. The outer limb 3 has at its end an inwardly directed projection which bears resiliently against the outside of the helmet shell 1, thereby to define a closed loop 9 for receiving a goggles band. The band is inserted in the loop 9 simply by flexing the branch or arm 3 to move the free end of such arm clear of the shell 1, the band is inserted and then the arm is released and it sprinys back to the position shown in Fig. 4.The inner limb 3 is provided with an inwardly extending pin 3 , which is snapped fitted in an aperture 10 provided in the region 1 , whereby the clip 3 is resiliently held to the lower rear edge l of the helmet shell.To disconnect the clip, the end of the inner limb 3 is deflected resiliently inwardly relative to the shell 1 to release the pin 3 from the hole 10. Other arrangements for the connection of the clip 3 to the shell 1 are possible. For example, instead of the pin being provided on the clip 3, the helmet shell l could be formed with a protruberance drawn out during the formation of the shell 1, to engage a recess in the limb 3 of the clip. Alternatively, such a protruberance might have a recess for receiving the pin 3 when provided on the clip 3.The shape of the various parts may be altered to suit requirements, without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims, and it is not necessary that the eye shield should be rotatable on the shell 1, or that the band clip should be located at the rear of the helmet. There could be two of the described band clips respectively at the sides of the helmet shell 1.
