# Apparatus for displaying two waveforms.

## Abstract
Two waveform traces to be simultaneously displayed are sampled and converted to a series of digital samples values. An electro optic display 1 , e.g. a liquid crystal or electro luminescent display has a first m set and a second n set of electrodes arranged in a matrix having m x n display elements. The matrix may be in cartesian XY or Ï‘ polar co ordinate format. In one form the m set of electrodes are arranged in two sub sets alternating with one another forming a sub set m The coded waveforms V A priority encoder 36, 38 to 46 modifies each sample value of the traces as necessary to ensure that two values for any given n electrode do not appear on the same subset of m electrodes.
