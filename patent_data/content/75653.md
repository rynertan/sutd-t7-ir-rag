# Optical fluid analysing apparatus.

## Abstract
This invention relates to an optical fluid analyzing apparatus which includes transparent means 12, 13 of known refractive index n₁ providing a cell 14 for receiving a fluid sample of unknown refractive index n₂ . A diffraction grating 10 is formed in an inner wall 11 of the cell. A light source 15 is positioned at an incident angle ϑ₀ with a grating to satisfy the Bragg condition. A pair of detectors 16, 17 intercept the 0th order and 1st order diffracted light. Circuit means 18 responds to signals generated by the detectors to provide an output indicative of the refractive index of the sample.
