# Reinforced fiber composite material and method for making same.

## Abstract
A continuous fiber composite material, comprising a fiber matrix impregnated with a resin filling the interstices between said continuous fibers. In order to enhance the transverse properties of the composite, the invention provides for a secondary matrix reinforcement using carbon microfibers dimensionally much smaller than the continuous fibers and randomly dispersed in the resin, and proposes a method for making such carbon microfibers from commercially available carbon fibers. For use in the manufacture of fiber composite material components, particularly for aerospace appliances.
