# PHOTOGENERATION OF ACTIVE FORMATE DECOMPOSITION CATALYSTS FROM TRANSITION METAL COMPLEXES CONTAINING MANGANESE

## Abstract
A process for producing hydrogen from formate and water by photogenerating an active formate decomposition catalyst from a transition metal complex having a formula RMn CO ₃ is disclosed. The preferred catalysts are CH₃C₅H₄Mn CO ₃ and C₅H₅Mn CO ₃. This process overcomes the slower reaction rates when utilizing Group VIb hexacarbonyl compounds, Cr CO ₆, MO CO ₆, or W CO ₆ as active formate decomposi tion catalysts. Additionally, this process may be combined with a process for generating formate from carbon monoxide and hydroxide in a basic solution. The combined processes are the water gas shift reaction.
