# SPECTRUM ANALYZER AND LOGARITHMIC AMPLIFIER THEREFOR

## Abstract
The spectrum analyzer comprises an input for receiving electromagnetic signals in a predetermined first frequency band and an image reject mixer for reducing the power of images of the received signals while down converting the signals to an intermediate frequency. The image reject mixer reduces the signal power level to approximately that of the background noise of the signal. The mixer is swept through a predetermined frequency band in order to down convert each frequency in the received signal band individually. The down converted signals are logarithmically compressed using a multi stage logarithmic compression circuit having variable gain amplifiers in each stage.
