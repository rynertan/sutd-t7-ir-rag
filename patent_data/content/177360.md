# Digital receiver response control for the reception of telemetry signals from implanted medical devices.

## Abstract
A gain control system for verifying the programming of an implanted medical device is provided for an external programming unit which receives transmitted signals from the implanted device and verifies if these signals represent valid 1 and 0 data bits. If the signals of an encoded message unit are valid signals then processing continues. If some of the signals are invalid due to noise interference, the gain of the receiver of the programming unit is decremented in steps as long as the error rate exceeds a predetermined number of errors per unit time.
