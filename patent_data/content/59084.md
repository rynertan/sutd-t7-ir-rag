In this embodiment, light 22 from a laser 20 is incident at about 45 onto the grat ing 26 . The diffracted S component, which leaves the beam splitter perpendicularly to the incident beam, passes through a λ ₄ wave retardation plate 28 and is focussed by lens 30 onto a video disc 24 . Reflected light passes back through the lens and the wave retardation plate, emerging from the plate 28 as a P polarized beam. This beam passes straight through the grating 26 to fall on a detector 32 .

## Description
Polari ang Beamsplitter Device This invention relates to a polarizing beamsplitter device in which a polarizing beamsplitter is placed in the optical path of a source of coherent radiation. Polarizing beamsplitters are known in the art, e.g. typical transmittance and reflectance characteristics are disclosed in pages 157, 158 of Handbook of Lasers edited by Robert J Pressley, Chemical Rubber Company. In general, it is desired that a polarizing beamsplitter provide a high transmittance for the P component of a laser input beam and a high reflectance for the S component.One type of prior art beamsplitter that has been so employed is a cube consisting of two prisms having their diagonal surface joined together. The cube beamsplitter disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,704,934 is representative of such devices. Beamsplitters are also extensively used in optical readout of the information contained on video discs. A prior art representation is found in the September 1978 RCA Review, Vol.39, No. 3 at page 395. These prior art beamsplitters are typically of calcite or glass construction resulting in the disadvantage that they form a relatively massive component compared with other components in a laser system. A further disadvantage is the relatively high cost of such materials. The present invention is intended to overcome these disadvantages, and to provide a low cost, low mass beamsplitter. The beamsplitter device of the invention is characterised in that the beamsplitter is formed as a surface relief transmission grating having a grating period d equal to said wavelengt ivided by a value of between 1.2 and 1.5, said grating essentially completely diffracting incidentS polarized light and transmitting P polarized light, said grating being placed in the optical path of said coherent radiation so that said radiation is incident an angle Ei and diffracted at a substantially equally angle ed, where Gired 45 . The beamsplitter, in a preferred mode, has a high diffraction efficiency for S component light and high transmittance for P component light and finds an exemplary use in a laser video disc read write system as described below.The beamsplitter can be formed as a surface relief transmission grating of the type disclosed in Applicant s co pending European Patent Application No 80301651.8 Publication No 0020076 . While the grating described in said co pending application was used as a holographic scanning element, its use generally as a beamsplitter, and particularly in combination with optical readout elements disclosed herein represents a novel and useful application of the unique grating properties. A beamsplitter device in accordance with the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a graph plotting grating diffraction efficiency of a beamsplitter as a function of incident light polarization and dratio. Figure 2 is a schematic of a video disc laser system utilizing the beamsplitter of the present invention. Figure 3 is a schematic of a video disc system using a diode laser and a pair of beamsplitters to provide compensation for wavelength shifts. Figure 4 shows a second embodiment of a video disc laser system. Figure 5 is a schematic of a system utilizing a beamsplitter of the present invention to combine the output of two lasers. As disclosed in said co pending application, a plane linear diffrac tion grating is constructed so as to provide a scanning beam trace of an input laser beam. This scan system was realized by forming the grating with a grating spacing d which had a relation to the input laser beam wavelength , of Id 1 to 1.6 and by making the input and diffraction angle approximately 450. The effect of such a grating on the incident light polarization was hinted at inFigure 12 of that application. Figure 1 of the present application shows the results of more precise measurements and data. Referring to Figure 1, plots 10 and 12 represent the diffraction efficiency as a function of A Id for both S andP light polarization components, respectively. As shown, the S component is almost completely diffracted at anyA d value while the P component is increasingly transmitted with increasing 2, d values reaching an almost total transmission value at aai d value of approximately 1.414. The properties of this type of grating lend themselves extremely well to an exemplary use as a beamsplitter in a laser system which reads or writes the information content of a video disc. Referring now to Figure 2, there is shown a laser source 20 which produces a beam 22 having a wavelength A, which is used to read or write upon video disc 24. Polarizing beamsplitter 26 is a surface relief transmission grating formed either by known holographic or ruling techniques and having a grating period defined by the expression A d 1.414. Input beam 22, consisting of an S polar ized light with its electric field perpendicular to the plane of incidence, is incident on the grating at an angle of 450 and, fromFigure 1, the S component will be diffracted out at an angle of 450, Le 900 to the incoming beam while the P component, with its electric field in the plane of incidence, is almost entirely transmitted through the beamsplitter.The diffracted S component beam passes through aA 4 retardation plate 28 thereby converting the input linear polarization to circular polarization. The beam is then focused by lens 30 onto the surface of disc 24. If in the write mode, the laser source would be operated at the energy levels required to form the information bearing apertures, or valleys in the disc. If in the read mode, the laser beam will read the information previously formed on the disc.Appropriate tracking means known in the art can be employed to move components 26, 28 and 30 in a tracking mode. If the system is operated in the read mode, the beam is reflected upwards through lens 30 and passes again through plate 28 undergoing conversion from circular to linearly P polarized light. The P polarized beam is incident on beamsplitter 26 at 450 and, therefore, is transmitted at almost 10096 efficiency through the beamsplitter and onto detector 32. Detector 32 then produces an output signal that is sent to appropriate read circuitry. It is thus apparent that the polarizing beamsplitter of the present invention has enabled a very attractive system for optical disc storage and readout. The diffraction and transmission characteristics of the beamsplitter have been effectively utilized so as to, in effect, do the work of two separate components in the optical path. The beamsplitter is lightweight and simplifies the tracking function it lends itself to replication techniques and hence is relatively inexpensive to manufacture. Its efficiency is as qood as,or better than, the known corner cubes or plates. The beamsplitter can be used most advantageously with gas laser sources such as He Ne because of the well defined wavelength of such sources.Diode lasers, because of their wavelength spread and temperature dependent shift during warm up may result in undesirable tracking errors for some systems. A correcting mechanism for such systems is shown in Figure 3.Referring to the figure, laser source 40, for illustrative purposes is assumed to be a Hitachi Series 1000 diode laser having a wavelength of 0.82 m. S polarized beam 42 is incident on a first plane grating beamsplitter 44 at an angle of 450 The grating period for this configuration can then be determined by solving for 1.414d 0.82 ,xm or d .05798 sm. A second beamsplitter 46 with identical properties, i.e. formed by the same forming process, is placed parallel to beamsplitter 44. S polarized beam 42 has its S component beam. diffracted out of splitter 44 along path 42a at an angle of 450 while the P component is transmitted therethrough. Upon incidence at grating 46, the polarized beam is again diffracted at 450 emerging in an optical exit path which is parallel with the entrance path of beam 42. The diffracted S component beam passes through a k4 retardation plate 48 thereby converting the input linear polarization to circular polarization. The beam is then focused by lens 50 onto the surface of a disc 52. In the read mode, the beam is reflected through lens 50 and passes again through plate 48 undergoing conversion from circular to linearly P polarized light. The P polarized beam is incident on beamsplitter 46 at 450 and therefore is transmitted therethrough, past the shortened edge of splitter 44 and onto detector 54. During laser warm up conditions, however, it is assumed that a wavelength shift of 1 nm has occurred. For this condition, beam 42 is diffracted by splitter 44 along a slightly different path, represented by dotted line 42b shown at an exaggerated deviation angle for illustrative purposes .Because of the identical construction and parallel placement of beamsplitters 44 and 46, the error beam after being diffracted by splitter 46, will emerge parallel with input beam 42 and therefore parallel to the beam following the normal path. The diffracted S polarized beam is again circularly polarized by plate 48. Focusing lens 50 has the property of focusing all parallel rays entering it to the same focal point so beam 42 is focused onto the desired segment of the disc 52. The reflected beam in the read mode is projected back through the components in the same manner as described above. To summarize the above system, given two plane gratings fabricated so as to satisfy the optimum formulation d 1.414, souree and placed in a parallel relationship, a beam of light incident at an angle of 450 to the first of the pair will, of necessity, exit the second parallel to the direction of the entrance beam. This characteristic is, therefore, utilized to compensate for the effects of wavelength shift, or spread, in the source which would otherwise cause errors in the diffraction path. Since any diffracted rays within the small limits of wavelength shift which are normally experienced will all travel parallel paths from splitter 46 to the lens, all rays will be focused to the same desired writing or reading zone on the disc. Figure 4 illustrates another use of the plane grating beamsplitter in an optical readout system wherein the input beam polarization is modified before it encounters the beamsplitter. In this mode, the beamsplitter is made to act more like a conventional beamsplitter by transmitting and diffracting any ratio of incident light as selected by the modifying means. In Figure 4, S polarized light source 51 generates S polarized light component 52 which passes through 2 retardation plate 54. In a first selected orientation of plate 54, beam 52 will be transmitted, unmodified, through the plate, i.e. theS component will be completely transmitted. If the plate 54 is rotated by 450, only the P component of beam 52 will be transmitted.For rotation angles between the initial position and the 450 rotation position, beam 52 will be elliptically polarized transmitting to the beamsplitter said P components of varying intensity. Thus, in the system shown, if plate 54 is oriented so that substantially all of the S component is transmitted, unmodified, therethrough, the beam, after conversion from linear to circular polarization by plate 58 and focusing by lens 59, can be used in a write mode to record information on the surface of disc 60, assuming the input levels from source 51 have been set high enough A typical write source would be a gas laser such as argon or He Cd. . If the system is to be operated in a read mode, plate 54 is rotated at some angle between 0 and 450 so that only some percentage of the S polarized light is transmitted therethrough. The diffracted beam in this case is at a lower power level than the write beam and can be used to read out information on disc 60 and reflect signals to detector 62 as described in the previous systems. As shown in Figure 4, beamsplitter 56 is mounted on the surface of a light transmitting member 64. This member, besides providing a support for the beam splitter, also blocks reflection from the splitter input surface from being directed at the detector 62. Alternatively, an anti reflection coating may be placed on the splitter surface. These expedients are equally applicable to the arrangements shown in Figures 2 and 3. It will be appreciated that the beamsplitter, especially when modified as described in the above paragraph, can be used in place of the conventional birefringent beamsplitter known in the art. The beamsplitter of the present invention would have the advantages of lightness, economy and versatility not possessed by prior art beamsplitters. Numerous other uses can be made of the polarizing beamsplitter consistent with its diffraction trans mittal properties. Figure 5 illustrates a system wherein two laser sources of the same wavelength, operating at their maximum system power levels, each of which is insufficient to accomplish a specific task, e.g. heavy duty welding , have their power levels combined by utilization of the instant beamsplitter. Source 70 produces an S polarized beam 72, source 74 produces a P polarized beam 76.By synchronizing operation of the two beams, their power levels can be combined by adding them together at plane diffraction grating beamsplitter 78. Thus, assuming the beamsplitter is formed with the optimum jild ratio, input beam 72 is diffracted at the 450 diffraction angle while input beam 76 is almost entirely transmitted, resulting in a combined beam 80. Various other modifications can be made to the beamsplitter without departing from the basic principles as set forth herein. For example, although the beamsplitter gratings described in Figures 2, 3 and 4 required use of a focusing lens, the gratings could be holographically formed so as to have some optical focusing power and thus dispense with the necessity of a lens. This can be accomplished either by varying the grating period and or forming the grating on a curved surface. As seen in Figure 1, there are other values of A Id which can be selected and profitably utilized for some systems. For example, A d values of 1.3 1.55 will provide diffraction efficiencies which will be acceptable for certain uses. It is obvious from Figure 1 that by adjusting the grating modulation, a beamsplitter for S polarized light can be made to have any ratio of transmitted to diffracted light with minimum energy loss in the beamsplitter grating.
