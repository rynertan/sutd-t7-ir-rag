## Description
3 SUBSTITUTED DISENZO b,flTHIEPINS, COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM AND THEIR USE AS PROSTAGLANDIN ANTAGONISTS This invention relates to prostaglandin antagonists. The prostaglandin antagonists of the present invention are 3 substituted dibenzo b,f thiepin derivatives having the structural formula EMI1.1 Compounds in accordance with the present invention have been found useful in treating a variety of conditions, such as allergic asthma, where excessive contractile activity of prostaglandins and prostaglandin biosynthetic intermediate compounds occurs. In Formula I, Z is thio, sulfinyl, or sulfonyl X is N R3, wherein R3is hydrogen, loweralkyl, aryl, hydroxy, loweralkoxy, loweracyloxy, amino or loweralkylamino or X may have the formula EMI2.1 wherein Y and T are each independently NR4,O or S and R4 and R5 are each independently hydrogen or loweralkyl and the broken line represents a possible bond between R4 and R5 when R4 and R5 are not hydrogen RÚ and Rê are each independently hydrogen, halogen including chloro, bromo, fluoro and iodo, amino, C1 to C4 alkyl, C1 to C4 alkanoyl, hydroxyl, C1 to C4 alkoxy, thiol, C1 to C4 alkylthio, C1 to C4 alkylsulfinyl, C1 to C4 alkylsulfonyl, trifluoromethyl, trifluoromethylthio, cyano, nitro, and C to C4 alkyl or dialkylamino, aralkyl including benzyl and phenethyl, hydroxyalkyl as CH3CHOH and the dotted line indicates either an olefinic bond or saturation at the 10 , ll position, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. As used herein, the term halogen or halo includes chlorine, bromine, iodine, and fluorine.Unless otherwise specifically stated, the terms loweralkyl and loweralkoxy include straight and branched chain alkyl and alkoxy groups having 1 to 4 carbon atoms in the alkyl or alkoxy moiety such as, for example, methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, methoxy, ethoxy, n propoxy, and isobutoxy.The term loweralkanoyl includes straight or branched chain alkanoyl groups having 1 to 4 carbon atoms in the alkanoyl moiety such as, fo r example, formyl, acetyl, propanoylw and isobutyryl. The term aralkyl includes straight or branched chain alkyl radicals having one of the hydrogens replaced by a phenyl or substituted phenyl group including phenyl, halophenyl such as chloro, bromo, iodo, and fluorophenyl, nitrophenyl, aminophenyl, hydroxyphenyl, loweralkylphenyl, and the like. A preferred group of the formula I compounds are those in which Z is sulfinyl or sulfone. These dibenzotb,fGthiepin derivatives antagonize the actions of contractile prostaglandins, such as PGF2a, PGG2, PGH2, and TXA2. The use of agents which act as prostaglandin antagonists offers new approaches to therapy in a number of disease states. For example, certain prostaglandin s, such as PGF2, PGG2, and PGH2, are potent contractants of bronchial muscle. Indeed human asthmatics have been shown to be especially sensitive to the bronchial constricting action of PGF2a. In addition to the involvement of contractile prostaglandins in chronic obstructive lung disease or asthma , prostaglandins are known to play a role in other allergic conditions, as well as inflammation, diarrhea, hypertension, angina, platelet aggregation, cerebral spasm, premature abortion, and dysmenorrhea. In addition to the prostaglandin antagonist actions, the dibenzo b,f thiepins of this invention are antagonists of slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis SRS A . This contractile substance is released in the lung tissue in allergic asthma, and antagonism of its actions contributes to alleviation of this disease. The precursor aldehydes which may be represented by the formula A of the dibenzo b,f thiepins of this invention are prepared according to the following general reaction scheme EMI4.1 wherein R1, R2, and Z are as defined above. As shown in the above reaction scheme, an appropriately substituted 3 cyano dibenzo b,f thiepin is reduced and hydrolyzed to the correspondingly substituted dibenzo b,f thiepin 3 carbox aldehyde in the presence of a metal containing reducing agent in accordance with the following procedures. In one method of effecting the conversion of the 3 cyano substituent to a 3 carboxaldehyde substituent, the 3 cyano dibenzo b,fithiepin is treated in dry ether with hydrogen chloride gas and anhydrous stannous chloride at a temperature of 0 to 500C, but preferably between 0 and 10 C. Solvents for the reaction are ethers or other inert anhydrous solvents which do not contain an active hydrogen and which will dissolve the reactants. The intermediate which first forms is the imino chloride salt of the amine which is reduced by the action of stannous chloride to the intermediate tin halide complex.This intermediate aldiminium stannic chloride complex is then hydrolyzed to produce the desired dibenzo b,f thiepin 3 carboxaldehyde. In order to isolate the aldehyde from the tin complex, it is sometimes necessary to utilize a chromatographic procedure and or a second hydrolytic step using an aqueous alcohol solution. In an alternate procedure for converting 3 cyano dibenzo b,f thiepin 3 carboxaldehydes and the corresponding 10,11 dihydro compounds, the selected cyano compound is treated with from 1 to 5 parts by weight of Raney alloy 50 Ni 50 Al in aqueous formic acid. The mixture is stirred at temperatures from OOC. to reflux temperature, but preferably at the reflux temperature for a period of from 1 24 hours. When the reduction and hydrolysis is complete, the product is recovered by removal of the alloy by filtration while hot, and extraction of the product from the filtrate, followed by crystallization from ethyl acetate. In a further alternate procedure for the preparation of dibenzo b,f thiepin 3 carboxaldehydes or the corresponding 10,11 dihydro derivative, the selected 3 cyano dibenzo b,fjthiepin or the 10,11 dihydro derivative employed as starting material is reduced to the corresponding aldehyde by selective reduction with sodium hypophosphite and Raney nickel in aqueous acid preferably aqueous acetic acid or mixtures containing pyridine in aqueous acetic acid . The reaction is preferably conducted at 250C, although the temperature may be maintained at from 1 to 100C to moderate the speed of reaction and or to increase the yield of product obtained. The product is readily recovered from the reaction mixture after removal of the Raney nickel catalyst by filtration, followed by washing with ethyl acetate to extract any occluded product.The combined filtrate and washings containing the product are then extracted with a mixture of ethyl acetate and ether and the product obtained as a solid residue by evaporation of the solvents from product containing extract. In a further alternate procedure for preparing dibenzo b,f thiepin 3 carboxaldehydes, the corresponding l0,11 dihydro 3 hydroxymethyldibenzo b,fithiepin, or a 10,11 dihydro compound is oxidized by means of pyridinium chlorochromate or other suitable oxidizing agent, in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane, at a temperature between OOC and reflux temperature, but preferably at room temperature, for a period of 1 to 24 hours. When oxidation is complete, the mixture is filtered through a bed af Florisil and then washed through with the solvent. Evaporation of the filtrat affords the dibenzo b, f thiepin 3 carboxyaldehyde which may be purified by chromatography and or recrystallization as may be appropriate. A further alternate procedure is employed when the starting material contains a reducible substituent such as a nitro group. In such instances, the substituted e.g., 8 nitro dibenzo b,f thiepin 3 carboxylic acid chloride is reduced with lithium tri tert butoxy aluminum hydride in tetrahydrofuran at 780C. Products which may be obtained directly by reduction of the appropriate nitrile are dibenzo b,f thiepin 3 carboxaldehyde and dibenzo b,f thiepin 3 carboxaldehyde 5,5 dioxide or derivatives bearing R1 and R2 substituents which are resistant to the reducing effect of the reaction conditions employed. Ordinarily the dibenzo b,f thiepin 5 oxide or R1, R2 derivatives thereof are prepared by oxidation of the corresponding dibenze b,fjthiepin with organic peroxides such as peroxy acids like m chloroperbenzoic acid. The oxidation can be carried further, if an additional equivalent of acid is employed, to produce the corresponding dibenzo b,f thiepin 5,5 dioxides.It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that variations in these preparative schemes will allow one to prepare a variety of substituted dibenzo b,f thiepin 3carboxaldehydes, as well as the corresponding thiepin 5 oxides and the thiepin 5,5 dioxides. From the above described aldehydes, the compounds of formula I can be readily prepared by well known methodology. These include, inter alia, oximes, o acetyloximes, o alkyloximes, hydrazones,Schiff bases, acetals, thioacetals and the like. As described in greater detail in EuropeanPatent Application No. 11,067, an appropriately substituted mercaptobenzoic acid II is reacted with m dibromobenzene III R3 Br to obtain the o 3 bromophenylthio benzoic acid IV. Or alternatively, an appropriately substituted o bromobenzoic acid II R2 Br is reacted with m bromobenzethiol III R3 SH to give IV EMI8.1 where R1 and R2 are each selected from hydrogen, nitro, amino, C1 to C4 alkanoyl, hydroxyl, C to C4 alkoxy, C1 to C4 alkylsulfinyl, C1 toC4 alkylsulfonyl, and C1 to C4 alkyl, trifluoromethyl, and trifluoromethylthio. R2 andR3 are different and alternatively are thiol and bromo. Generally, the sulfide forming reaction is carried out according to the methods described byJilek et al., Monatsh. Chem. 96, 200 1965 Protiva et al., Czechoslovakian Patent 121,337, Chem.Abstracts 68 105,247t 1968 and U.S. Patent 3,711,489 and by other procedures well known in the art. The resulting o 3 bromophenylthio benzoic acid IV is reduced to the alcohol, brominated, and the bromo replaced with cyano. The cyano derivative is then hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid V. EMI9.1 The carboxylic acid V is transformed into the 3 bromo 11 oxo 10,11 dihydrodibenzo b,f thiepin by first conversion to the acid halide with thionyl or phosphoryl halide followed by Friedel Crafts cyclization with a Lewis acid such as aluminum chloride to give VI. Reduction of the ketone VI with alkali metal borohydrides, followed by heating with catalytic amounts of a mineral acid, such as sulfuric acid or toluenesulfonic acid provides the 3 bromodibenzo b,f thiepin VII.EMI9.2 The 3 bromo derivatives VII is then converted to the 3 nitrile VIII by reaction with cuprous cyanide in a high boiling polar solvent such as dimethylformamide, N methylpyrrolidone, and the like.EMI10.1 The cyano intermediate VIII may be oxidized with organic peroxides such as peroxy acids, for example, m chloroperbenzoic acid and the like, in a stepwise fashion to the corresponding sulfoxide XI and sulfone XII, controlling the molar ratio of oxidant to reductant. This determines the oxidation level of the sulfur. For example, a 1 1 molar ratio results largely in the production of sulfoxide XI.In contrast, a 2 3 molar excess of oxidant results in a yield predominantly comprising the sulfone XII.EMI10.2 Compounds of type I where the 10,11 double bond is saturated are prepared from intermediate VI in which the 3 bromo is converted to a cyano derivative XVII.EMI11.1 The compound XVII is reduced by conventional methods, e.g., Wolff Kishner, to compound XXII.EMI11.2 Substituent R1 in I can also be introduced by modification of the nitro group in VIII R1 NO2 by known procedures. For example, XXXI II can be reduced with stannous chloride in acidic medium, hydrochloric acid, and the like, to yield XXX IV which can be hydrolyzed with mineral acids or bases to XXXV. EMI12.1 Alternatively, XXXIII may be oxidized with peroxides, for example, m chloroperbenzoic acid to yield XXXVI which can be reduced to XXXVII and then hydrolyzed with mineral acids or bases to XXXVIII.EMI12.2 Intermediate XXXIV can be reacted with sodium nitrite in mineral acid to the diazonium saltXXXIX, where X is a mineral acid counter ion, for example, C1 , HSO4, BF4, and the like, which on reaction with CuCl and CuC12 yields intermediate XL which can be hydrolyzed to the acidXLI. Intermediate XL may also be oxidized to the sulfone derivative.EMI13.1 Compound XXXVII can be transformed in the usual manner to the diazonium salt XLV.EMI13.2 The 3 hydroxymethyldibenzo b,f thiepin and the 10,11 dihydro compounds which may be used as intermediates for the preparation of the title compounds may be made by reduction of the corresponding dibenzo b,f thiepin 3 carboxylic acids or esters as described in detail in European PatentApplication No. 11,067.EMI14.1 These alcohols may be oxidized to the sulfinyl or sulfonyl oxidation levels by a peroxy acid, for example m chloroperbenzoic acid or the like, in a stepwise fashion as described for the nitriles XI and XII above.EMI14.2 One method of preparing the compounds I of the present invention is to react the aldehyde A see page 4 with hydroxylamine or a derivative of hydroxylamine such as methoxyamine or benzyloxyamine. The reaction is carried out in a lower alkanol solvent, preferably ethanol, at temperature ranging from 0 to 1000C, preferably at room temperature, for from 1 to 24 hours depending upon the rate of the reaction. A mixed solvent system of alkanol water may be advantageously employed in certain cases as the product may then precipitate directly from the reaction mixture. Various compounds of the formula I may be made in a similar way from hydrazine or substituted hydrazines and aldehyde A.These oxime or hydrazone derivatives can then be converted to other Compounds I by acylation with an acid anhydride or an acyl halide in a suitable solvent such as pyridine or a solvent such as ether, ethylacetate, benzene, toluene or the like containing a suitable base such as pyridine, triethylamine, N,N dimethylaniline or the like. Acetal derivatives of formula I can be prepared by heating the aldehyde A and the desired alcohol e.g. methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, 1,3 propanediol, etc. in the presence of an acid catalyst such as p toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, a sulfonic acid resin, a perfluorosulfonic acid resin, or the like. The often preferred catalyst is p toluenesulfonic acid. In certain cases, it will be preferable to remove the water formed by means of azeotropic distillation with a co solvent such as benzene, toluene, 1,2 dichloroethane or the like. Imino derivatives of formula I are prepared by refluxing a mixture of aldehyde A and a primary amine in a solvent such that the water formed is removed by azeotropic distillation. Suitable solvents for this purpose include benzene, toluene, 1,2 dichloroethane, l,l,l trichldroethane, 1,1,2 trichloroethylene, or the like.

Analysis calc d C 73.02 H 4.38 N 4.06 S 9.28 Found C 73.33 H 4 34 N 4.17 S 9.17 The compounds of formula I wherein Z is defined as sulfinyl are capable of existing as optical isomers because of the tetrahedral structure of the sulfoxide substituent. Thus, the sulfoxide disclosed in the Examples are racemic mixtures of D and L isomers which may be resolved by known procedures into their enantiomers. Each of the enantiomorphic isomers may exhibit variation in biological potency. Thus, for example, the compounds of Examples 4, 6, 9, 12, 21, 22, and the 5 oxide compounds prepared in 16, 27, and 29, may by resolved by conventional procedures into their D and L enantiomorphs. From these, the resolved forms of the formula I compounds can then be prepared. The compounds of formula I are useful in the treatment or prophylaxis of mammalian disease conditions where excessive undesirable contractile activity of prostaglandins, such as PGF2, or prostaglandin biosynthetic intermediates contribute.These conditions include asthma, inflammatory states such as arthritis, allergy, diarrhea, hypertension, angina, platelet aggregation, cerebral spasm, premature abortion, and dismenorrhea. In particular, they are of value in reaginic mediated asthma extrinsic asthma . The magnitude of a prophylactic or therapeutic dose of compound of formula I will, of course, vary with the nature and the severity of the condition to be treated and with the particular compound of formula I and its route of administration. In general, the dose range lies within the range of 0.2 mg to 100 mg per kg body weight of a mammal. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise a compound of formula I as an active ingredient or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and may also contain a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. The term pharmaceutically acceptable salts refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non toxic bases including inorganic bases and organic bases. Salts derived from inorganic bases include sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium, calcium, magnesium, ferrous, zinc, copper, manganous, aluminum, ferric, manganic salts and the like.

For a helpful discussion of pharmaceutical salts see S.M. Berge et al., Journal ofPharmaceutical Sciences, 66, 1 19 1977 , the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise a compound of formula I as an active ingredient, and may also contain pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. The compositions include compositions suitable for oral, rectal, ophthalmic, pulmonary, nasal, dermal, topical, or parenteral including subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous administration, although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the condition being treated and on the nature of the active ingredient. They may be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. For use where a composition for intravenous administration is employed, a suitable dosage range is from 0.2 to 10 mg preferable 1 to 5 mg of a compound of formula I per kg of body weight per day, and in the case where an oral composition is employed a suitable dosage range is about, e.g., 1 to 50 mg of a compound of formula I per kg of body weight per day, preferable from 10 to 40 mg kg. Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention suitable for oral administration and by inhalation in the case of asthma therapy may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets, or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient as a powder or granules or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid, a non aqueous liquid, an oil in water emulsion, or a water in oil liquid emulsion. Such compositions may be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy but all methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more necessary ingredients. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired presentation.For example, a tablet may be prepared by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine, the active ingredient in a free flowing form such as powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, lubricating, surface active or dispersing agent. Moulded tablets may be made by moulding in a suitable machine, a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid dilu2nt. Desirably, each tablet contains from 50 mg to 500 mg of the active ingredient and each cachet or capsule contains from 50 mg to 500 mg of the active ingredient. Although the invention has been described in the foregoing specification in terms of the use of the novel thiepins in the treatment and control of human and warm blooded animal disease conditions characterized by excessive undesirable contractile activity of prostaglandins and prostaglandin biosynthetic intermediate compounds, and particularly of asthma, it will be recognized that, in addition to the involvement of contractile prostaglandins in chronic obstructive lung disease e.g., asthma , prostaglandins play a role in other allergic conditions as well as in inflammation, diarrhea, hypertension, angina, cerebral spasm, premature abortion, and dysmenorrhea Also, the thiepins of this invention are potentTXA2 biosynthesis inhibitors, inhibiting platelet aggregation, and can be useful in diseases such as atherosclerosis, varient anginal and myocardial infarction.
