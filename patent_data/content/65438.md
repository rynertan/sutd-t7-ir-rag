# Serpentine charge transfer device.

## Abstract
A serpentine charge transfer device is disclosed in which two parallel series of charge transfer wells are dis posed adjacent to each other. Channel stops and electri cally controllable barriers are suitably introduced into the two series to cause charge to flow in a serpentine fashion along the two series of charge transfer wells. The invention doubles the resolution of linear imaging devices.
