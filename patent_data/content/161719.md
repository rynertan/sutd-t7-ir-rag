# Improved removable disk cartridge.

## Abstract
A removable hard disc memory cartridge 10 , for use with a drive mechanism including a spindle 20 located within a drive housing. The drive housing interior is provided with stationary position registration members 23, 23 min which cooperates with mating side edge portions of the cartridge 33A, 33B, 33C, 34, 35, 36 to provide positive positioning when the cartridge is inserted into the drive housing. A disk lock 46, 52 carried by the cartridge maintains the internally mounted cartridge disk 14 in a secured locked position when the cartridge is not in use, the lock mechanism cooperating with release posts 21, 22 carried by the drive housing to free the disc 14 for rotation just prior to engagement by the drive spindle 20 . The disk has a self centering hub including a spindle referencing member having an aperture for receiving the free end of the spindle, the referencing member including angularly spaced arcuate segments 71, 72 closely matched to the radius of curvature of the drive spindle and providing a lateral abutment for the outer surface of the spindle, the referencing member further including a spindle biasing spring 75 laterally spaced from the arcuate segments 71, 72 and engageable with the outer surtace of the spindle 20 for urging the spindle into surface contact with the arcuate segments. The housing includes an end wall with an air exit port 82 laterally displaced from the transducer access port 81 which provides a circumferentially oriented flow exit path for air entering the volume enclosed by the cartridge via the access port when the disc 14 is rotated.
