# Antacid material based on magnesium aluminium hydroxide and the preparation thereof.

## Abstract
The present invention provides an antacid material based on magnesium aluminium hydroxide and a process for the preparation of an antacid material based upon magnesium aluminium hydroxide, wherein magnesium hydroxide and or magnesium oxide is reacted with an aqueous solution of aluminium sulphate, in an atomic ratio of magnesium to aluminium of 1 1 to 3 1, until the pH of the reaction mixture is from 4.0 to 8.0, whereafter water soluble components are removed from the mixture which is isolated and, if descired, dried. The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions containing an antacid material prepared by this process, in admixture with a conventional pharmaceutical adjuvant. The antacid material has advantageous characteris tics, e.g. an effective buffering action on gastric juices and stability.
