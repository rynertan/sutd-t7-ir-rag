# DEEP FAT FRYER

## Abstract
A high efficiency deep fat fryer has a fry tank 20 from which fat is continuously withdrawn for heating and fil tration. A pump 54 circulates part of the fat withdrawn through a helical finned tube heat exchanger 44 position ed between a gas fired burner 50 and the bottom of the fry tank. The remaining portion of the fat is directed through a filter 40 located in the bottom zone 34 of the fry tank 20 . The fryer includes a control system with sensors such as pressure switches for preventing damage to the fat at low flow rates and devices for expelling moisture trapped in the pump. The filter 40 has an element of material such as car bon impregnated cloth which may be quickly replaced without draining fat from the tank by raising the filter 40 by swinging it on a pipe 120 about a swivel coupling 122 un til it is raised above the level of the fat in the tank 20 .
