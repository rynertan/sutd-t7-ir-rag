# Crimp blade holder.

## Abstract
A holder 20 mounting a plurality of crimp blades for crimping of a moving web 62 includes a cylindrical body having a curved outer surface, and eight slots 30 defined in the outer surface. A crimp blade is secured within each of the slots such that rotation of the body causes the blades to crimp a web 62 moving therepast. The diameter of the body and the positions of the blade mounting slots 30 on the surface thereof are selected so that with the blades mounted to the body, rotation thereof causes crimps to be applied to the moving web 62 with spacings thereon between successive crimps defining a repetitive pattern of substantially 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0 and 3.0 inches 5.08, 5.08, 5.08, 5.08, 5.08, 5.08, 5.08 and 7.62 cm .
