# Improved melt spinning process.

## Abstract
A process of melt spinning a fibre forming polymer par ticularly polyethylene terephthalate or poly hexamethylene adipamide at a minimum wind up speed of 1000 metres per minute in which there is added to the fibre forming polymer before spinning a small proportion of a polymer capable of forming an anisotropic melt in the temperature range at which the fibre forming polymer may be melt spun whereby in the process there is suppression of wind up speed compared with the process carried out in the absence of the added polymer.
