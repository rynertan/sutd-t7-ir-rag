# Compression resistant expended, porous polytetrafluoroethylene composite.

## Abstract
A composite laminated article is provided, useful for printed circuit boards in transmission of electrical signals in the high frequency range of the order of 10 GHz, comprising a layer of expanded, porous polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE , maintained in a fully stretched state, affixed firmly to a solid substrate layer. The composite is formed by stretching ex truded, unsintered PTFE in this fully stretched state, and bonding the stretched PTFE to a susbstrate. The porous PTFE layer in this composite has unexpectedly high compression resistance.
