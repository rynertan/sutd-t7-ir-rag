## Description
DESCRIPTION The present invention relates to domestic food processors of the kind, hereinafter referred to as the kind set forth consisting of a base containing an electric driving motor, an aperture in the upper surface of the base through which a driving shaft from the motor projects, a substantially cylindrical food processing container closed at its upper end by a removable lid having an aperture for the introduction of food into the container, complementary means on said base and said container whereby said container is removably attached to an upper part of said base with the driving motor shaft projecting through a hole in the bottom of the container, a sleeve in the said container surrounding the hole in the bottom of the container and projecting upwardly into the container to form an annular liquid containing well around said hole, a food processing tool for processing food in said container being removably mounted on said driving shaft. While there are many food processors of the kind set forth on the market the prototype of all food processors of this kind is illustrated in British PatentSpecification 1,380,318 in the name of Pierre Verdun. The introduction of the Verdun type food processor onto the market in the early 1970s represented a substantial departure from previous practice in connection with domestic food processing machines. While machines were available which, with a number of attachments could perform a variety of tasks such as mixing, blending, grating, grinding, chopping, whipping etc. and which were specially adapted for domestic use as against commercial use, they performed these tasks only with the aid of a wide variety of different attachments. The popularity of the Verdun type food processor is attributable to the fact that a wide range of operations can be performed in the same container with only simple changes of tool for different functions. Generally speaking also the Verdun type food processor performed the processing operations very much more quickly than existing machines. All food processing machines of the kind set forth at present on the market have adopted the basic design of theVerdun machine with but few changes. A particular feature of that machine which is clearly seen in Figure 2 of the above mentioned British patent specification is that the container in which food processing takes place is a right cylinder in which the cylinder wall is at right angles to the bottom.This is a feature that is found in all food processors derived from the Verdun design. In many cases the angle between the cylindrical wall and the base is made very slightly greater than 900 simply for the purpose of facilitating removal of the container from the mould in which it is ma de. Such divergencies from 900 as there have been have been quite insignificant so far as the operation of the machine is concerned. The ultimate cost of a food processor of the kind set forth to the purchaser is to a considerable extent, governed by te size of the electric motor, the larger the motor the greater the cost. Thus for a food processor having a container of a given size, if it can be made to process a larger than normal quantity of foodstuff with the same electric motor or a normal quantity with a smaller electric motor, useful reductions in cost can be made in terms of a given capacity for food processing. The present invention is based on the surprising discovery that by using a container with an outwardly tapering side wall a significant increase in food processing capacity for a given motor size can be achieved. By way of example it was found that in an experimental food processor, by giving the container an outward taper from top to bottom of 7 1 20 the meat chopping capacity could at least be doubled and a similar increase in the capacity for forming dough achieved. For example whereas a similar food processor of conventional construction had a capacity for grinding about 250 grams of meat the same processor with an outwardly tapering container as described above was found to be capable of processing between 500 and 750 grams of meat. The use of tapered containers in some forms of food preparation apparatus, for example those known as liquidisers is well known. Such devices operate on a principle somewhat different from food processors of the kind set forth and are capable of use for specific purposes only.As pointed out above the accepted wisdom in the art s that the containers of food processors of the kind set forth shall be right cylinders. The present invention consists in a domestic food processor of the kind consisting of a base containing an electric driving motor, an aperture in the upper surface of the base through which a driving shaft from the motor projects, a substantially cylindrical food processing container closed at its upper end by a removable lid having an aperture for the introduction of food into the container, complementary means on said base and said container whereby said container is removably attached to the upper part of said base with driving motor shaft projecting through a hole in the bottom of the container, a sleeve in the said container surrounding the hole in the bottom of the container and projecting upwardly into the container to form an annular liquid containing well around said hole, a food processing tool for processing food in said container being removably mounted on said driving shaft, characterised in that the wall of the container is outwardly tapered from top to bottom at an angle measured from a line parallel to the central axis of the container of between 50 and 200 whereby a significant increase in food processing capacity is achieved as compared with a food processor of the kind set forth having a container having a right cylindrical wall. The angle of taper a of Fig. 1 measured between the wall of the container and a line parallel to the central axis thereof is between 5 and 200 and is preferably about 7 1 20. In order that the nature of the invention may be better understood a preferred form thereof is hereinafter described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawing which shows a cross sectional view of a food processor according to the invention. In the drawing a container having a flat bottom and straight wall tapering outwardly of an angle a of about 7 1 20 is shown at 10. This is attached to the base 11 of the food processor in a conventional manner and is provided with a lid 12 also of conventional construction. As shown in the sawing the container has in it a chopping tool 13 to which food to be chopped is offered through the entry tube 14 in te lid 12.It is to be noted that if the container 10 is constructed so that the smaller diameter is approximately equal to the diameter of a food processor of conventional size then the tapered wall will provide a larger diameter at its open end which, apart from an increase in volumetric capacity of the container also has advantages in that the diameter of the tube 14 can be made larger thus allowing larger portions of food to be offered to the tool 13. The chopping tool 13 includes cutting blades 13a and 13b projecting radially from a central support to points adjacent the container wall the upper blade 13a being of slightly greater length than the lower blade 13b to take account of the outwardly tapering form of the container wall. Within the base 11 is the usual driving motor 15 having a driving shaft 16 projecting through a hole 17 in the top of the base 11. The chopping tool 13 is removably mounted on the driving shaft 16. The container 10 has a hole 18 in its bottom which is surrounded by the sleeve 19. A skirt 20 on the container 10 surrounds the upper part of the base ll and is a press fit on it. The other features of construction shown in the drawing are of a conventional nature and are not relevant to an understanding of the present invention. A taper of 7 1 20 was found by experiment to give 0 optimum results. A taper of less than about 5 does not give results sufficiently advantageous to make its adoption worthwhile. A taper greater than 200 gives rise to problems in the construction and operation of the food processor. The best results were obtained with a container having a substantially flat bottom and a frusto conical wall making an obtuse angle with the bottom.
