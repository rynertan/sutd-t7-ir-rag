## Description
ANTHELMINTICS The present invention relates to novel compounds having anthelmintic activity, to processes for their production and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them. Tetramisole and levamisole are well known anthelmintics of structure EMI1.1 Tetramisole is the dl form whereas levamisole is the form. It has now been found that certain novel compounds, some of which are derivatives of levamisole, have anthelmintic activity.In particular these compounds have nematocidal activity, and certain of the compounds also have flukicidal and or cestodicidal activity. Accordingly the present invention provides a compound of formula I EMI2.1 having the 6 S absolute configuration, or, where appropriate, a salt thereof wherein X is selected from EMI2.2 Y is oxygen, or sulphurR1 is alkyl or aralkylR2, R3 and R4 are the same or different and each is selected from hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, substituted aryl, aralkyl, substituted aralkyl, and, in addition R2 and R3 are also selected from heterocyclyl and substituted heterocyclyl,except that when Y is oxygen, R2 and R4 are hydrogen, and the dotted line is an optionally present carbon carbon bond. Compounds of formula I have an asymmetric carbon atom at the 6 position shown above. It is believed that anthelmintic activity is associated with those compounds of formula I wherein the 6 position has Sabsolute configuration. 6 S Tetramisole is laevorotatory and, in general, the compounds of formula I having 6 S configuration are also laevorotatory.However, certain compounds of formula I may have additional asymmetric carbon atoms and optically pure isomers of such compounds cquld be dextrorotatory despite having the 6 S configuration. It is to be understoodsthat the present invention encompasses all compounds of formula I having the 6 S configuration, and such compounds may be optically pure or admixed with stereoisomers, including stereoisomersihaving the 6 R absolute configuration. isoureas and Thetisothioureas of formula I , ie those compounds wherein X is EMI3.1 may exist in tautomeric forms, as shown below, when either R2 or R4 is a hydrogen atom EMI4.1 and in such circumstances these two structures may be regarded as equivalent. All such tautomers are encompassed by the invention. Suitable alkyl groups are C1 10 alkyl groups, preferably C1 4 alkyl, most preferably methyl or ethyl groups. Alkyl groups having 3 or more carbon atoms may be straight, branched or cyclic. Suitable aryl groups are monocyclic or fused bicyclic groups, such as phenyl or naphthyl groups, preferably phenyl groups. Suitable aralkyl groups comprise a monocyclic or fused bicyclic aryl moiety and a C1 10 alkylene moiety. Preferably the aryl moiety is phenyl.Preferably the alkylene moiety has from 1 to 4 carbon atoms and most preferably it is methylene. Suitable heterocyclyl groups include pyridyl and pyrimidyl. Suitable substituents for the aryl and heterocyclyl groups include halogen, hydroxy, amino, mono or dialkylamino, nitro, cyano, alkyl, alkoxy, carboxy, alkylcarbonyl, sulphonyl, sulphinyl and trifluoromethyl groups. Conveniently, substituted aryl groups bear up to three substituents. Preferred substituents for the aryl and heterocyclyl groups are fluoro, chloro, nitro, cyano, acetyl and trifluoromethyl groups. Some of the compounds of formula I do not form salts, but where they do suitable salts include the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, nitrate, sulphate, acetate, citrate, lactate, maleate and pamoate salts. Preferably salts are pharmaceutically acceptable, however this is not essential as other salts may be useful in the purification of compounds of formula I and salts of optically active acids may be useful in the separation of enantiomers of compounds of formula I . The isothioureas of formula I are particularly advantageous in having flukicidal activity. In a particular aspect of the present invention there is provided the first medical use of the compounds of formula I as hereinbefore defined.Alternatively the invention provides a compound of formula I for use in the treatment of the human or animal body, especially for the treatment or prophylaxis of helminthiasis and especially in humans or animals of economic importance such as cattle and sheep, and companion animals such as cats and dogs. The present invention also provides a process for producing compounds of formula I wherein X is a group EMI5.1 which process comprises reacting a compound of formula I or the 6 R isomer thereof wherein X is a group EMI6.1 or a salt thereof, wherein at least one of R2, R3 andR4 is hydrogen, with a compound of formula II z R1 II wherein Z is a leaving group such as a halogen atom, and, if necessary, thereafter racemising the produc t. Preferably Z is an iodine atom. Conveniently the sodium salt of the sulphur anion of the thiourea of formula I is employed. The reaction may be effected in a conventional manner for converting thioureas to isothioureas.Conveniently the reaction is effected by reacting the compounds of formulae I and II in an aqueous polar organic solvent in the presence of a strong base. The present invention further provides a process for producing a compound of formula I wherein X is a group EMI6.2 which process comprises either a reacting a compound of formula III EMI7.1 with a compound of formula IV Y C N R3 IV and, if necessary, thereafter racemising the product, or b reacting the compound of formula V EMI7.2 with a compound of formula VI EMI7.3 and, if necessary, thereafter racemising the product. The reaction of a compound of formula III with a compound of formula IV may be effected in conventional manner, for instance in an organic solvent such as acetone, at approximately ambient temperature. In some circumstances, particularly where the 2,3 double bond is present, the amine of formula III reacts with two molecular equivalents of the isothiocyanate IV to form a compound thought to be a betaine derivative of formula VII EMI8.1 Betaine derivatives of this type are formed between tetramisole and several isothiocyanates J HetChem, 14, 989 1977 . The desired thiourea can be obtained from these betaine thioureas by, for example, treatment with ammonia solution followed by chromatographic purification or fractional crystallisation. The reaction of a compound of formula V with a compound of formula VI may be effected in conventional manner, for instance in an organic solvent such as acetone, at an approximately ambient temperature. The intermediate of formula V may be produced by conventional methods, for instance by reacting thiophosgene or an analogue thereof, with a compound of formula III wherein R4 is hydrogen, under conventional conditions, such as in aqueous medium in the presence of acid and at elevated temperature, preferably at about 500C. The present invention further provides a process for producing a compound of formula I or the 6 R isomer thereof wherein X isEMI9.1 which process comprises converting a compound of formula I whereinX isEMI9.2 to the required compound of formula I and optionally thereafter racemising the product. The conversion described above may be effected in conventional manner, such as by treating a compound of formula I whereinEMI9.3 with lead II oxide or mercury II oxide in the presence of a suitable alcohol, or by treating a compound of formula I whereinEMI9.4 with mercury II chloride in the presence of a suitable alcohol. It will be understood that compounds of formula I may be prepared as a mixture of 6 R and 6 Sisomers by starting from dl m aminotetramisole, or a derivative thereof the amine of formula III . If it is desired to obtain the 6 S isomer, this may be achieved by using the pure I m aminotetramisole. Alternatively, with compounds which form salts, the 6 S isomer may be obtained from a mixture of 6 R and 6 S isomers by resolution in conventional manner.Otherwise the 6 S isomer may be produced from the l amine of formula III , itself prepared by resolution of the corresponding dl form. Such resolutions may be effected via an optically active salt formed from the racemic compound by reaction with an optically active acid such as d tartaric acid, dibenzoyl L tartaric acid or d 10 camphorsulphonic acid. Resolution reactions of this general nature are described in U.K. Patent No. 1 402 689 and U.S. PatentNos. 3 463 786 and 3 673 205. Furthermore, the 6 R isomer of a thiourea of formula I may be obtained starting from the 6 R amine of formula III , ie d m aminotetramisole, then racemised by standard methods. Pure 6 S isomer may then be produced by resolution of the 6 R , 6 Smixture and further 6 S isomer generated by racemisation of the recovered 6 R isomer. Where appropriate, salts of the compounds of the formula I may be prepared in entirely conventional manner, for example, by reacting the compounds with the appropriate acid. The compounds of formula I are useful in the treatment or prophylaxis of worm infections in humans and animals, such as cattle and sheep, cats and dogs. Accordingly, the invention also provides a pharmaceutical or veterinary composition comprising a compound of the formula I and a pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable carrier thereof. For oral administration the compositions may conveniently be in the form of solutions or suspensions of the active ingredient. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be mixed in with an animal feedstuff or animal feed supplement. The compounds of formula I may also be administered orally to animals in sustained release dosage forms, such as the rumen devices described inU.K. Patent No. 1 601 923 German Offenlegungsschrift 28 24 288 or European Patent Applications Numbers Al 0 010 987 and Al 0 021 758. For parenteral administration the carrier will be any vehicle conveniently used for such administration, for example sterile water, or preferably a formulation in which the carrier comprises from 55 to 85 v v propylene glycol, 0 to 5 benzylalcohol and sterile water to 100 of the carrier. Suitably the compositions consist of sufficient material to provide a dose of from 0.1 to 100 mg of active ingredient per kg of animal body weight per dose, more suitably 1 to 50 mg kg per dose. The invention also provides a method of treatment or prophylaxis of helminth infections in humans or animals, which comprises the administration to the infected or potentially infected human or animal of an effective non toxic amount of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable salt thereof. In particular aspects this method includes the treatment or prophylaxis of roundworm infections. It will be appreciated that it will, in some cases, be advisable to repeat the dosing of the infected or potentially infected human or animal with the compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable salt thereof according to conventional dosage regimes. Examples of such a regime include those used with anthelmintics such as tetramisole and levamisole. The following Examples illustrate the invention.
