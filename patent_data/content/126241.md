# BROWN STAIN SUPPRESSING PHENOL FREE AND CHLORINATED HYDROCARBON FREE PHOTORESIST STRIPPER

## Abstract
Stripping solution compositions which avoid the prob lem known as brown staining are provided. Relevant stripping solutions are those that are free from phenol and chlorinated hydrocarbon compounds and comprise a sur factant alkylarylsulfonic acid having 12 20 carbons, a hy drotropic aromatic sulfonic acid having 6 9 carbons and a halogen free aromatic hydrocarbon solvent with a boiling point above 150 C. To suppress brown staining, a water soluble sulfone is incorporated into the stripping solution. The stripping compositions effectively remove organic poly meric substances from inorganic substrates and are sub stantially clear water rinsable.
