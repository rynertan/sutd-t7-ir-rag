# Spacer damper for a bundled conductor of an electric line.

## Abstract
Spacer damper for a bundled conductor of an electric line comprising a support 1 bearing joints 2 for the arms 3 that hold the sub conductors wherein each joint 2 is composed by at least one frame 5 integral with or fixed to the support 1 , by a core 6 positioned within the frame 5 , by a plurality of elastic elements 7 for each frame 5 , each elastic element 7 being fixed by one end to the relevant frame 5 and by the other end to the relevant core 6 as well as by an arm 3 which bears at one end a clamp for clamping a sub conductor and which is fixed by the other end to a core 6 or to cores for the core or cores being allowed to move elastically within the frame 5 or the frames under the actions that the relevant sub conductor transmit to the arm.
