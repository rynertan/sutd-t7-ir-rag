Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of compounds of the formula II form a particularly preferred aspect of the present invention. In a further aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the formula II in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. By the terms pharmaceutical composition and pharmaceutically acceptable carrier are meant those compositions and carriers suitable for use in human and or veterinary medicine. The compounds of the formula II can conveniently be presented in the compositions of the present invention in an effective unit dosage form, that is to say in an amount sufficient to be effective against the bacterial organism The pharmaceutically acceptable carriers present in the compositions of the present invention are materials recommended for the purpose of administering the medicament. These may be liquid, solid or gaseous materials, which are otherwise inert or medically acceptable and are compatible with the active ingredient. These pharmaceutical compositions may be given parenterally, orally, used as a suppository, applied as an ophthalmic solution, or applied topically as an ointment, cream or powder. However, oral and parenteral administration of the compositions is preferred for human use. For veterinary use, intramammary as well as oral and parenteral administration is preferred. For oral administration, fine powders or granules will contain diluting, dispersing and or surface active agents, and may be presented in a draught, in water or in a syrup, in capsules or cachets in the dry state or in a non aqueous suspension wherein suspending agents may be included, or in a suspension in water or syrup. Where desirable or necessary, flavouring, preserving, suspending, thickening or emulsifying agents can be included. For parenteral administration, the compounds may be presented in sterile aqueous injection solutions which may contain antioxidants or buffers. As stated above, the free base or a salt thereof may be administered in its pure form unassociated with other additives in which case a capsule or cachet is the preferred carrier. Other compounds which may be included are, for example, medically inert ingredients, e.g. solid and liquid diluents such as lactose, glucose, starch or calcium phosphate for tablets or capsules olive oil or ethyl oleate for soft capsules and water or vegetable oil for suspensions or emulsions lubricating agents such as talc or magnesium stearate gelling agents such as colloidal clays thickening agents such as gum tragacanth or sodium alginate and other therapeutically acceptable accessory ingredients such as humectants, preservatives, buffers, and antioxidants which are useful as carriers in such formulations. Alternatively the active compound may be presented in a pure form as an effective unit dosage, for instance, compressed as a tablet or the like. For veterinary use, different intramammary formulations will normally be prepared for use in dry cows and for use in milking cows. Thus, formulations for dry cow use will normally be in an oil, such as peanut oil, gelled with a gelling agent such as aluminium monostearate. Formulations for milking cow use will usually contain an emulsifying agent for example Tween 20 or a polysorbate and a milk miscible carrier such as peanut oil or a mineral oil. It may be advantageous to include the compounds of formula II in a pharmaceutical composition which includes other active ingredients for example p aminobenzoic acid competitors such as sulphonamides.

The ratio of the compound of the formula II to sulphonamide will normally be from 3 1 to 1 10, for example 1 1 to 1 5. A particularly preferred composition of the present invention comprises a compound of formula II and a sulphonamide in a ratio of 1 2 to 1 5 preferably together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Tablets or other forms of presentation provided in discrete units may conveniently contain an amount of compound of the formula II which is effective at a dosage or as a multiple of the same, for instance for human use, units containing 2.5 to 200 mg usually around 30 to 100 mg and for veterinary use, units containing 30 to 500 mg. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be prepared by the admixture of a compound of the formula II with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Other active ingredients, such as a sulfonamide, or conventional pharmaceutical excipients may be admixed as required. The compounds of the present invention are useful for the treatment of microbial infections and, in particular, gram negative aerobic, gram positive aerobic or anaerobic bacterial infections in mammals. They are particularly useful in the treatment of Staphylococcal infections for example mastitis in cattle, Neisseria infections in humans, for example Still another aspect of the present invention provides a method for the treatment or prophylaxis of bacterial infections in mammals by the administration of an effective non toxic antibacterial amount of a compound of formula II or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or a composition as hereinbefore described. As indicated above, the compounds of the formula II are generally useful in treating bacterial infections by rectal, parenteral, topical or oral administration. The compounds of formula II are normally administered at a dose from 0.1 mg kg to 30 mg kg per day and preferably 1 mg kg to 10 mg kg. The dose range for adult humans is generally from 25 to 300 mg day and preferably 100 to 200 mg day. The dose range for intramammary administration of the compounds of the formula II is generally from 100 to 500 mg, preferably 200 mg to 400 mg, per quarter of the udder to dry cows. Milking cows will normally receive four to six medications of a composition of the present invention, a dose being conveniently administered at milking time i.e. twice daily to each of the desired quarters of the udder. Dry cows will normally receive only one medication of a composition of the present invention, one dose being provided to each of the four quarters of the udder. The compounds of formula II and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be prepared by methods known for the synthesis of compounds of analogous structure. Thus the present invention provides a process for preparation of compounds of the formula II as hereinbefore defined which process comprises Wherein Y is as hereinbefore defined, R The reaction of guanidine with a compound of the formula A or B will take place under conditions analogous to those described in U.K. Patent Nos. 1 133 766 and 1 261 455 respectively for the preparation of structurally related benzyl pyrimidines. Conveniently the reaction is carried out in a The reaction of a compound of the formula C with guanidine and the preparation of the compounds of the formula C will be carried out by methods analogous to those described in Belgian Patent No. 855 505. In the compounds of the formula D when R The compounds of formula D may be prepared by methods known in the art, for example as described in U.K. Patents No. 875,562 and 1,132,082 or German Offenlegungschrift 2,258,238. The compounds of the formula D wherein R Suitably Z is a dialkylamino or cyclic amino group containing up to 10 carbon atoms a dimethylamino group is particularly convenient. The reaction will be carried out under conditions well known to those skilled in the art of Mannich reactions. It has been found that the reaction may suitably be carried out at an elevated temperature, suitably between 100 and 200 C in a solvent having a suitably high boiling point, for example a glycol such as ethylene glycol. The dethiation is suitably carried out by hydrogenolysis in the presence of a transition metal catalyst Raney nickel is particularly suitable for this purpose. This reaction will normally be carried out in a polar solvent, for example a Again, this is not a preferred method of preparing those compounds of the formula II wherein there are groups that are susceptible to a catalytic hydrogenation. The compounds of formula G wherein X¹ is sulphur or oxygen may be prepared by the following reaction scheme The cyclisation of a compound of the formula G takes place under conventional conditions, for example those described in The Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds , Wiley Interscience, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., N.Y. Heterocyclic Compounds , vol 2 R.C.Elderfield, ed., John Wiley and Sons, Inc., N.Y. p.11 ff, p.146 ff 1951 Advances in Heterocyclic Chemistry , vol 1, A.R.Katritsky and A.J.Boulton, ed., Academic Press, N.Y. p.217 ff 1970 and vol 18, A.J. Katritsky and A.J.Boulton, ed., Academic Press, N.Y., p. 362 ff 1975 . The preparation of a compound of the formula G from the corresponding acetal and its conversion to the corresponding compound of formula IV conveniently takes place The reaction of a compound of the formula H with 2,4 diamino 5 hydroxymethyl pyrimidine is normally carried out under the reaction conditions described for analogous reactions in U.K. Patent No. 1,413,471. Thus, the reaction is conveniently carried out in a polar solvent capable of dissolving both reactants at a non extreme temperature, for example between 50 and 150 C. The reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a strong acid catalyst, such as hydrochloric, acetic, methanesulphonic or p toluenesulphonic acids. In the case where there is an alkoxy group at the 4 position, it may be necessary to separate the desired compound of the formula IV or X from other substances present in the reaction mixture by conventional methods, for example by chromatography or crystallisation. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that when certain ring substituents are present in the final compounds of the formula II or when an unsaturated ring system is present certain methods of preparation will preferably not be used to make these compounds due to the possibility of the reaction conditions changing the final product group, for example hydrogenolysis or addition across the double bond when a double bond is present. Certain compounds of the formula II whilst having some antibacterial activity in their own right are useful also as intermediates in the preparation of other compounds of the formula II having interesting antibacterial activity. The intermediates of the formulae A to E and G which are novel form a further aspect of the present invention. In yet another aspect, the present invention provides the first use of the compounds of the formula II in human and veterinary medicine.
