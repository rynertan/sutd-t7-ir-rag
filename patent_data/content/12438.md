# Percussive tools.

## Abstract
A percussive tool has a percussion mechanism driven by a linkage that combines the simplicity of a connecting rod drive with the compactness of more complex drives. A first member, which may be a crank 6 , drives a sec ond member, which may be a cylinder 20 mounted for sliding and pivotal movement in a guide 22 . A piston 21 is mounted for reciprocating movement in the cylin der 20 . Rotation of the crank 6 reciprocates the piston 21 causing blows to be imparted to a tool piece. The tool piece is rotated as well as being subjected to per cussion.
