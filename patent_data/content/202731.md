# Chain saws.

## Abstract
A chain saw bar 34, 16 has an elongated shape, a saw chain guideway around substantially the length of the peri meter thereof and a matching saw chain sprocket 18 in the nose 16 thereof. There is a region 52, 54 of calculated variation in strength in the interior of the bar at a location removed from the sprocket 18 , so that if the bar is subjected to an excessive bending force in use, the bar will tend to become bent at about the region of variation in strength.
