# SECAM PAL television signal converter and receiver including said converter.

## Abstract
A SECAM encoded chrominance signal is converted to a chrominance signal of a quasi PAL form for further processing in PAL decoder apparatus 40 . The converter includes an FM detector 17 serving to demodulate respective SECAM subcarriers sequentially, and a modulator 23 wherein the color difference signals recovered by the FM detector 17 amplitude modulate, in appropriate sequence, quadrature related phases of PAL subcarrier frequency oscillations derived from the PAL decoder 40 via a phase switching circuit 33 . The color difference signals supplied to the modulator 23 are augmented in 21 by line rate burst pedestals effecting the insertion of bursts in the quasi PAL signal developed by the modulator 23 . The phasing of the inserted bursts alternates between a first phase corresponding to the oscillation phase subject to modulation by R Y color difference signals, and a second phase differing from the first phase by 180 . Insertion of bursts of the first phase immediately precedes the development of R Y modulated subcarrier waves by the modulator 23 , while insertion of bursts of the second phase immediately precedes the development of B Y modulated subcarrier waves by the modulator 23 .
