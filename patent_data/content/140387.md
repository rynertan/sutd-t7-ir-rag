## Description
ELECTROPHOTOGRAPHIC LIGHT SENSITIVE MATERIAL The present invention relates to an electrophotographic light sensitive material. More particularly, it is concerned with an electrophotographic light sensitive material having superior flexibility and improved adhesion between an electrophotographic light sensitive element and an electrically conductive support. Commonly used electrophotographic light sensitive materials comprise an electrically conductive support and an electrophotographic light sensitive element provided on the support. The following electrophotographic lightsensitive elements are known a photoconductive layer in which inorganic light semiconductors such as zinc oxide, cadmium sulfide and selenium, or organic photoconductive substances such as electric charge transporting compounds e.g., polyvinyl carbazoles and hydrazones are bonded together by the use of a resinous binder a photoconductive member vacuum deposited on the electrically conductive support and a laminated member comprising a charge carrier generating layer and a charge carriertransporting medium layer. These electrophotographic light sensitive materials, however, have the disadvantage that adhesion between the electrically conductive support and the electrophotographic light sensitive element is insufficient because of poor affinity In working the electrophotographic lightsensitive materials i.e., cutting or slitting, the electrophotographic light sensitive element can be stripped off at the site of cutting or slitting. Also, when the electrophotographic light sensitive materials are bent in handling or conveying in the form of a roll film, the electrophotographic light sensitive element is stripped off. Such e lectrophotographi c light sensitive materials are not suitable for practical use.If liquid toners are used and the electrophotographic light sensitive material is subjected to a stress in the liquid, this undesirable separation can occur to significant extent. This separation can occur over the whole light sensitive material or in a very fine spot form. In order to overcome the above problem, provision of an intermediate layer of various compounds between the electrically conductive support and the electrophotographic light sensitive element has been proposed. These compounds include polyvinyl butyral see Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 28838 75 , polyvinyl acetate see Japanese PatentPublication No. 46263 74 , and polyamide see JapanesePatent Application OPI No 114132 76 The term OPI as used herein means a published unexamined Japanese patent application . In electrophotographic light sensitive materials in which such an intermediate layer is provided, the adhesion between the electrically conductive support and the electrophotographic light sensitive element is improved. However, there is a residual potential, which gives rise to problems such as formation of fog. Various compounds for use in the preparation of such intermediate layers are also described in JapanesePatent Publication No. 46263 74. An intermediate layer of polyvinylidene chlqride, for example, improves the adhesion between the electrically conductive support and the electrophotographic light sensitive element. In coating the intermediate layer, however, blocking occurs between the intermediate layer and the reversal roller of a coating machine because the softening point of polyvinylidene chloride is low. Moreover, when the electrophotographic light sensitive element provided on the intermediate layer is bent, cracks are formed in the light sensitive element. An object of the present invention is to provide an electrophotographic light sensitive material having superior flexibility. Another object of the present invention is to provide an electrophotographic light sensitive material which has superior adhesion between the electrophotographic light sensitive element and the electrically conductive support. It has been found that these and other objects are attained by providing between the electrically conductive support and the electrophotographic light sensitive element an intermediate layer containing a a vinylidene chloride acrylonitrile copolymer and b a polymeric substance having a softening point of at least 1000C. The present invention relates to an electrophotographic light sensitive material comprising an electrically conductive support and an electrophotographic lightsensitive element with an intermediate layer sandwiched therebetween, wherein the intermediate layer contains a a vinylidene chioride acrylonitrile copolymer and b a polymeric substance having a softening point of at least 1000 C. In the vinylidene chloride acrylonitrile copolymer used in the present invention, the weight ratio of vinylidene chloride to acrylonitrile is from about 1 9 to 9 1 and preferably from about 3 7 to 7 3. The molecular weight of the copolymer is from about 1,000 to 1,000,000 and preferably from about 10,000 to 100,000. Although the copolymer can be dispersed in water or organic solvents and used as a latex, it is preferably used in the form a solutions in an organic solvent for the purpose of increasing the adhesion strength.Typical examples of vinylidene chloride acrylonitrile copolymers soluble in organic solvents include Saran ResinR200, R202, etc., as produced by Asahi Kasei Co., Ltd.The synthesis of the copolymer is described, for example, in U.S. Patent 3,132,124. The polymeric substance having a softening point of at least 100C that is used in the present invention is dispersible or soluble in water or organic solvents. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a polymeric substance having a softening point of at least 1000Ci preferably at least 1300C, which is soluble in an organic solvent and a vinylidene chloride acrylonitrile copolymer are dissolved in an organic solvent. Representative examples of such polymeric substances include polyvinyl carbazole, polycarbonate, polyamide, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, polymethyl methacrylate, and triacetyl cellulose. In cases where the binder used in the light sensitive element is a polymeric substance having a softening point of at least 1000C, it is preferred that the same polymers of the same type be used in the preparation of the intermediate layer in view of their affinity. A preferred example of the polymeric substance is polycarbonate, preferably having a molecular weight of 5,000 to 100,000, which exhibits good adhesion and has few adverse influences on electrophotographic characteristics.Preferred polycarbonates are polyesters of carbonic acid and polyvalent alcohols or phenols, and can be produced by various conventional techniques such as the ester exchange process, the phosgene process, and the self polycondensation process. Typical examples of useful polycarbonates, include those containing the following repeating units I IV either alone in combination, although the present invention is not to be construed as being limited thereto.EMI6.1 In order to increase the adhesion between the electrically conductive support and the light sensitive element and to prevent the blocking of the intermediate layer to a reversal roller of a coating machine, it is preferred that the polymeric substance b be used in an amount of from about 60 to 1,800 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the vinylidene chloride acrylonitrile copolymer a . More preferably the polymeric substance b is used in an amount of from about 100 to 900 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the vinylidene chloride acrylonitrile copolymer a . Solvents or dispersing media which can be used in the preparation of a coating solution for the intermediate layer of the present invention are not undly limited and include benzene, toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene, dichloromethane, dichloroethane, trichloroethane, cyclohexanone, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, and mixtures thereof. Of these compounds, solvents capable of dissolving the components contained in the intermediate layer are preferably used. The thickness of the intermediate layer of the present invention is, as a dry film thickness, from about 0.01 to 5 ij and preferably from about 0.1 to 1 The electrically conductive support used is not unduly limited, and it is sufficient if at least the surface is electrically conductive.Representative examples are drum or sheet supports made of metals such as aluminum, copper, iron and zinc, and supports of, e.g., paper, plastics, and glass, the surface of which is made electrically conductive by techniques such as vacuum deposition of metals such as aluminum, copper, zinc, and indium vacuum deposition of electrically conductive compounds such asIn203 and SnO2 lamination of a metallic foil and dispersing carbon black, powdered electrically conductive metallic compounds e.g., In203 and SnO2 , powdered metals, and so forth in a binder polymer. The effect of the intermediate layer of the present invention is particularly remarkable when organic photoconductive substances are used in the light sensitive element. Light sensitive elements can be divided into two types a single layer element in which an organic photoconductive substance is dispersed in a binder or a charge carrier transporting medium and a laminated element in which a charge carrier transporting medium layer is provided on a layer containing an organic photoconductive substance. A wide variety of organic photo conductive substances is known in the art, and any of these known substances can be used in the present invention. Representative examples of such organic photo conductive substances are described inResearch Disclosure, No. 10938 May, 1973 , page 61, Electrophotographic Element, Material, and Process Polymeric organic photoconductive substances which are particularly effective in the present invention are described below. It is desirable for polymeric organic photoconductive substances to have a nucleus containing s electrons.Typical examples of such nuclei include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon nuclei such as naphthalene, anthracene, pyrene, perillene, acenaphthene, phenylanthracene, and diphenylanthracene heteroaromatic compound nuclei such as carbazole, indole, acridine, 2 phenylindole, and N phenylcarbazole and their halogen or lower alkyl substituted derivatives.

These sensitizing dyes are used in a sufficient amount to sensitize the organic photoconductive substances, and the amount of the sensitizing dye added varies depending on the type of organic photoconductive substance and on the type of sensitizing dye used. In general, the sensitizing dye is used in an amount of from about 0.01 to 100 parts by weight, preferably from about 0.1 to 30 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the photoconductive substance. Binders which can be used include cyanoethyl cellulose, nitrile rubber, polycarbonate of bisphenol A, linear polyester, a styrene butadiene copolymer, and a vinylidene chloride acrylonitrile copolymer. Plasticizers which can be used include biphenyl chloride, an epoxy resin, triphenylmethane compounds, a cumarone resin, and a low molecular weight xylene resin.

In preparing a single layer electrophotographic light sensitive element, finely divided particles of a photo conductive substance are dispersed in a binder solution or a solution with a charge carrier transporting compound and a binder dissolved therein and the resulting dispersion is coated on an electrically conductive support and dried.In this case, the thickness of the electrophotographic light sensitive element is from above 1 to 30 11 and preferably from about 3 to 15 p. A laminated electrophotographic light sensitive element is prepared by vacuum depositing a photoconductive substance on an electrically conductive support, or coating a solution of the photoconductive substance in a solvent on the electrically conductive support, or coating a dispersion of the photoconductive substance in a suitable solvent or, if desired, a solvent with a binder dissolved therein on the electrically conductive support to form a charge carrier generating layer and then coating a solution containing a charge carrier transporting compound and a binder on the charge carrier generating layer.In this case, the thickness of the charge carrier generating layer is not more than about 4 11 and preferably not more than about 2 , and the thickness of the charge carrier transporting medium layer is from about 3 to 30 u and preferably from about 5 to 20 u The photoconductive substance is ground to a particle size of not more than about 5 11 , preferably not more than about 2 p by means of a dispersing machine such as a ball mill a sand mill, or a vibration mill. If the amount of the photoconductive substance to be used in the single layer type light sensitive element is too small, the sensitivity of the resulting electrophotographic light sensitive material is poor, and it is too large chargeability is reduced and the strength of the electrophotographic light sensitive element is decreased. The amount of the photoconductive substance being added to the electrophotographic light sensitive element is from about 0.01 to 2 times, preferably from about 0.05 to 1 time the weight of the binder. The amount of the charge carrier transporting compound to be added, if desired, is from about 0.1 to 2 times, preferably from about 0.3 to 1.3 times the weight of the binder. Charge carriertransporting compounds are used as binders by themselves, it is preferred that the amount of the diazo compound added be from about 0.01 to 1.0 time the weight of the binder If in the laminated electrophotographic lightsensitive element a photoconductive substance containing layer is coated as a charge carrier generating layer, the amount of the photoconductive substance used is preferably at least about 0.1 times the weight of the binder.If the amount of the photoconductive substance used is below this amount, the light sensitivity obtained is low.The amount of the charge carrier transporting compound to be added to the charge carrier transporting medium is from about 0.2 to 2 times, preferably from about 0.3 to 1.3 times the weight of the binder. If polymeric charge carriertransporting compounds are used as binders, they can be used without the use of other binders. Additives used in the present invention and a use thereof are described in, for example Japanese patent applications OPI 30936 73 corresponding to U.S. Patent 3,745,005 , 114132 76, 129237 76 and 143564 80. In preparing the coating solutions for these layers, the solvents or dispersing media used in the preparation of the coating solution for the intermediate layer of the present invention can be used. The present invention is described in greater detail with reference to the following Example, although the present invention is not to be construed as being limited thereto. Unless otherwise indicated, all parts, percents and ratios are by weight. EXAMPLE 1 Coating solutions A to F having the compositions shown in Table 1 were prepared as coating solutions for an intermediate layer, and coating solutions G and H having the compositions as described hereinafter were prepared as coating solutions for an organic photoconductive layer. These coating solutions were coated on a 100 p thick polyethylene terephthalate film support with a 60 A thick In2O3 layer vacuum deposited thereon PET film made electrically conductive with In203 to form an intermediate layer and an organic photoconductive layer in this sequence and then were dried to produce an electrophotographic light sensitive material. The dry thickness of the intermediate layer was 0.2 11, and the dry thickness of the organic photoconductive layer was 7 u.

The diameter of the cylinder at which cracks were formed in the photoconductive layer was determined. The rating scale was as follows. 1 Even if the light sensitive material is wound on a cylinder having a diameter of 1 nun, no cracks are formed in the photoconductive layer. 4 mm Cracks are formed in the photoconductive layer. when the light sensitive material is wound on a cylinder having a diameter of 4 mm. 5 mm Cracks are formed in the photoconductive layer when the light sensitive material is wound on a cylinder having a diameter of 5 amen. The smallest figure is most desirable, and at a value of 5 mm or less, the light sensitive material can be used as a roll film. Adhesion Strength Lines were cut in the surface of the photoconductive layer at right angles using a cutter knife to form 100, 5 mm x 5 mm squares. A mylar tape produced by Nitto Co.,Ltd. was applied on the surface and then stripped off in parallel with the photoconductive layer. The number of squares removed was counted. The figure in Table 2 indicates the number of squares removed.Chargeability Chargeability was determined by measuring the surface electric charge V when the light sensitive material was corona charged at an application voltage of 7.5 kv.Specific Sensitivity Specific sensitivity was determined based on the exposure amount required to reduce the potential through light attenuation to 1 2 of the initial valve, with lightsensitive material No. 1 being assigned a value of 100.
