# Heating apparatus with sensor.

## Abstract
In a heating apparatus equipped with a sensor ele ment 20 sensing or estimating the state of a substance being heated, for example, a temperature probe contain ing a temperature sensor such as a thermistor in one end of a metal tube or a humidity sensor sensitive to vapor emanating from the substance being heated, an informa tion data suggesting a hint to the handling of such a sen sor element or instructing an appropriate heating sequence or process selected on the basis of the sensed state of the substance being heated is selectively read out from a voice data memory 13 to be synthesized into voice informa tion in a voice synthesizer 14 such as a PARCOR syn thesizer, and the voice information is announced to the user at a predetermined time. The user hearing the message can therefore manipulate the apparatus in such a way as to compensate for the inherent defect of the sensor ele ment and a menu requiring a very delicate procedure can even be successfully cooked without any failure of heating.
