## Description
This invention concerns a method to perform reciprocal welding of two tubular metal bodies, the axes of which, in the welding ared, form an angle different from 0 between each other. The invention also relates to a group of two or more tubular metal bodies weided according to the above mentioned method and specially designed to constitute, with other components, when needed, a metal piece of furniture, toi instance a garden furniture The wetdiong of two tubular metal bodies anoled to each other is usual I performed by using the technique of seam welding, p 1 ac i ny tl e two tubular bodies in the position that they nill have at the end of welding and carrying out welding by the use of external material and subsequent heating ol thea concerned area. This technique involves difficulties and inconveniences which create obstacles to the pi duction, for instance of metal furniture and specially of garden furniture.The production inconveniences are due to the fact that sean welding requires the presence of skilled operators and necessarily involves a considerable loss of time which reduces the production rate of the forniture manifacturing chain. On the other hand, there are also inconveniences and disadvantages related to the finished product, in that the long times required for seam welding involve considerable heating of the tubular bodies near the welding area and therefore an alteration of the physical conditions of same, said alteration leading to a change in the conditions of static resistance of the tubular bodies near the welding area, and therefore in general of tile whole finished product.Moreover, the presence of weld material makes it difficult to perform perfect fini shing by plastification in correspondence with the welding area, an additional operation of cleaning and polishing of s aid area being furthermore required. An object of the present invention is to propose a new method for welding tubular bodies under the cited conditions, which allows to eliminate the draw backs of the known technique and, therefore, allows to perform welding under optimal conditions, from the view point both of the production and of the finished product, and namely in very short timeS, ith possible automation of the operations The obtained product has a better static pesistance not affected by thermal changes near the welding area and can be finished, specially by plastification, in a better way. According to the present invention, these objects are achieved by a welding method as hereinabove defined, characterized by forming a double thick area in the wall of one of the two tubular bodies and by projection welding the two bodies in correspondence with said double thick area of the first tubular body. In particular, the double thick area is obtained by flattening or locally pinaching the first tubular body During the welding operation, said area at least partially penetrates into the original shape of the other tuhular body. In this way it is possible to obtain the advantages of a tube having higher thickness and in general a more resistant welding area, in that a reciprocal partial penetration occurs between the two welded bodies.The stress due to overheating is avoided or at least reducel, as the welding time is shortened, and the welding operation is performed by an extremely quick and possibly automated technique,without the need of weld material, with a surface finishing particularly suitable to. be covered by plastification in correspondence with the welded area. As above said, the invention also relates to a group of two or more metal bodies, welded by projection to each other, according to said method, as well as to a metal piece of furniture formed ba two or more structural components shaped as tubular bodies, welded to each other as already said. The different stages of ttie method according to the invention will be now schematically illustra ted with reference to the attacFied drawing where Figures 1 and 2 schematically shos , in perspective view and in section, the first operation to form a double thick flattened area on tile wall of one of the two tubular bodies to be welded to each other, for instance on the arm of a chair made of metal.. Figure.3 perspectively shows two tubular bodies, respectively forming the post or arm of a chair and the horizontal structural element supporting the plane part of same, in position of reciprocal presentation before welding. Figure 4 is a partial section according to a horizontal plane of the components of figure 3. Figures 5 and 6 are views correspondin g to those of figures 3 and 4 of the two tubular components i n a welded condition. First of all, referring to ficjtire 1 and figure 2, a first tubular metal bods 10, constituting for example the arm or post of a chair or metal I arm chair, is locally deformed as indicated by 12 by an operation of flattening or pinching capable of creating a double thick wall area, protruding from the original shape of the tubular body. As indicated in figures 3 and 4, the first tubular body 10, with its double thick area 12, is placed in front of the second tubular bodx 14, which must be welded to the first one to get the axes of the two tubular bodies to form an angle different from 00. In this case,the two tubular bodies are almost perpendicular to each other and in such condition they are reci procally approached so that the double thick area 12 is positioned in correspondence to and centred on the side of the wall of the second tubular body 14. The latter can eventualls have other elements of the finished product, for e ample a mesh structure 16 forming the supporting plane of the chair or arm chair. At this point, welding is performed according to a technique, known in itself, of projection welding, consi sting in making high amperage current pass in the two bodies to be welded arid in pusliiny the two bodies to each other, so that the contact area has a temperature sufficient to locally melt the material, owing to the increased resistance to the current.Welding according to this technique gives the result illustrated in figures 5 and here in particular it is possible to see that tile double thick area 12 of the first tubular body has entered almost partially into the original shape of the tubular body 14, so contributing to increase the static resistance of the welded tubular bodies.Finally, it should be added that this welding technique allows to obtain better finishing by plastification and the higher mechanical resistance of the welded area assures that, under stress, the Pieces welded to each other do not undergo reciprocal movements such as to break the plastic layer and therefore cause the beginning of rusting in the materials. What has been stated above, makes it obvious that said method according to the invention can be applied to welding any tubular metal body and for whatever application.Therefore, the invention also covers the assembly of two or more tubular metal bodies so welded. However,the invention finds its particular preferred application in the field of metal furniture, for instance garden metal furniture, obtained with a frame having tubular structure and usually finished l plastification.
