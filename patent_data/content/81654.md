# Household appliance with alarm warning device.

## Abstract
The appliance includes a control device capable of generating an alarm signal and a transmitter actuated by the alarm signal for transmitting a control signal to a remote receiver which in turn can operate a warning device in response to the control signal. The appliance is e.g. a deep freezer which generates the alarm signal if it does not operate correctly. Pref., the transmitter comprises an oscillator whose output is connected with the mains supply and the remote receiver comprises a decoder whose input is connected with the mains and whose output operates the warning device. The oscillator normally generates a coded reference signal and is turned off in response to the alarm signal, the decoder being actuated when the coded reference signal ceases.

## Description
DESCRIPTION HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCE WITH ALARM WARNING DEVICE The present invention relates to a household appliance, more particularly a deep freezer, provided with an alarm system capable of generating a warning signal in case the household appliance does not opera te correctly. Household appliances are known which are pro vided with control devices capable of operating an alarm device, e.g. an optical alarm or a buzzer built in the body of the appliance, when this latter does not operate correctly. These control and alarm devices are of particular importance in deep freezers, due to the need of preserving goods which are stored therein. However, it is customary to set up this kind of household appliances, particularly chest freezers, in rooms like storage cellars which are located far from the domestic living environment therefore, should the appliance fail the user would not become aware of the above mentioned warning signal. Thus, in these cases the alarm device is sub stantially useless, unless the user undesirably watches the room in which the household appliance is set up As is known, a temperature rise in a deep freezer may be caused also by a failure of the power supply. In case this failure lasts long, the resulting temperature rise exceeds an acceptable value and is signalled by the control device just when the power supply occurs again, that is when the stored goods may already be spoiled. The main object of the present invention is to provide a household appliance, particularly a deep freezer, capable of warning at a distance of possible alarm conditions of operation. A further object of the present invention is to provide a household appliance of the kind mentioned above having a control device which can immediately warn of a possible alarm condition even if the power supply fails. These objects are attained, according to the invention, in a household appliance, particularly a deep freezer, comprising a control device capable of generating an alarm signal, characterized in that it further includes a transmitter actuable by said alarm signal for transmitting a control signal to a remote receiver which in turn can operate a warning device in response to said control signal. The invention will be further described by way of non limiting example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 diagrammatically shows a household appliance provided with an alarm warning device and the enyiron ment in which they are set up according to the invention Figure 2 shows the block diagram of a preferred embodiment of the transmitter of the household appliance according to the invention Figure 3 shows the block diagram of a preferred embodiment of the receiver of the household appliance according to the invention. With reference to Figure 1, a household appliance 1 is shown, consisting for example of a deep freezer which is located in a room 12 remote from the domestic living environment 13. The deep freezer is connected with a supply mains 14 which is common to the two environments 12, 13 and is shown for clearness with dotted line. The deep freezer 1 is provided with an alarm warning system capable of transmitting a signal, through the supply mains 14, to whatever remote points in the domestic environment 13 in order to make the user aware of the said signal. This warning system comprises a transmitter 2 adjacent to the freezer 1, as well as a receiver 3 which can be located at whatever points of the supply mains within the living environment 13, preferably in the area the user mostly haunts. Both the transmitter 2 and the receiver 3 may be of a kind substantially known per s. With reference to Figure 2, for example, the transmitter 2 includes an oscillator 4 which is controlled by a temperature control circuit 5, cooperating with a thermal probe 11, usually provided in a deep freezer. The output of oscillator 4 is connected to the supply mains 14 through an interface 6 which preferably consists of the primary winding of a RF trans former and two capacitors for blocking the mains voltage. The oscillator 4 continuosly sends along the mains 14 a coded reference signal a sine wave having a predetermined frequency, for example when the deep freezer 1 operates correctly. In a way known per s, if probe 11 senses an excessively high value of temperature within the freezer, it causes the control circuit 5 to generate an output alarm signal capable off switching of the oscillator 4. With reference to Figure 3, the receiver 3 includes a decoder 7 which is tuned at the frequency of the reference signal from oscillator 4. The input of decoder 7 is connected with the supply mains 14 through an.interface. 8, similar to interface 6, whereas its output drives a warning device 10 via an output stage 9. More particularly, decoder 7 operates the warning device 10 when the coded reference signal at its input ceases. Receiver 3 is further provided with an independent power source like a buffer battery not shown , which ensures the operation of receiver 3 and thus of warning device 10 even if the power supply along the mains 14 fails. As stated above, if probe 11 detects a too high temperature value within the freezer 1 oscillator 4 ceases sending the receiver 3, via the mains 14, the reference signal therefore, decoder 7 operates the warning device 10 in order to make the user aware of the alarm conditions occurring at a distance. The household appliance according to the pre sent invention can also warn the user of a possible failure of the mains power supply, since the oscilla tor 4 ceases to operate as soon as the same failure occurs. In this case receiver 3, which is fed by its independent power source, operates the warning device 10, in response to the absence of the coded reference signal, as described above. In this way the user is warned of the said failure and can provide against it at the right time. It is to be noted that the reference signal, being properly coded, can easily be discriminated by the decoder7 with respect to possible noise components on the mains, avoiding in this way any casual operation of the warning device 10. Of course, a household appliance other than a deep freezer may be provided with an alarm warning device as described herein before and the appliance may undergo many modifications falling within the sco pes of the present invention.
