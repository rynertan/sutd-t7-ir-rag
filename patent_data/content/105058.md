## Description
A Driving Apparatus Useful In A Movable ToyThis invention relates to a novel driving apparatus for moving a toy, such as a toy car or the like in order to provide a rotary and straight movement, which utilizes a combination of permanent magnets and an electromagnet.Heretofore, a DC motor has usually been utilized as a driving apparatus for movable toy. The DC motor comprises a field, an armature and a commutator.The field is generally consisted of, as a most simple structure, a stator comprising a permanent magnet with opposite N and S poles, and arranged with a certain gap in relation to the armature to form a magnetic circuit.The armature is consisted of a rotor comprising a winding and a core, and mounted to a rotary shaft. The commutator is a part for electrical connection with the winding of the armature, and is connected to a DC source through a brush. In the DC motor thus constructed, the direct current is fed to the brush for passing through the coinmutator to the winding, thereby causing rotation of the armature.Since such type of the DC motor comprises the armature and the commutator directly connected thereto, rotation of the armature causes friction between the commutator and the brush contacted therewith, and generates a spark therebetween. As a result, the brush is too early worn out to aggravate rotary condition of the motor, resulting in a defect of durability for a long term use. Further, in a conventional motor only rotary movement may be produced but a direct straight movement cannot be obtained, which limits its application. Accordingly a general object of the invention is to provide a novel driving apparatus which eliminates the problems of the conventional driving apparatus described hereinbefore and which may allow both rotary and straight movement and is excellent in durability.A A principal object of the invention is to provide a driving apparatus which comprises a mobile body, an immobile body, a plurality of parmanent magnets fixed to the mobile or immobile body and spaced apart in a predetermined distance so as to direct their same polarity toward one direction, at least one electromagnet fixed to the immobile or mobile body so as to be spaced apart oppositely to the permanent magnets in a predetermined gap, a pair of contactless switches arranged symmetrically to a pole of the electromagnet in a sequential direction of the permanent magnets opposite to said pole, and a circuit for exciting the electromagnet so as to generate its attractive force to permanent magnet when one of the contactless switches is in a close position to the permanent magnet, while to generate its repulsive force against the permanent magnet when the other contactless switch is in a close position to the permanent magnet.Another object of the invention is to provide the driving apparatus wherein a combination of the electromagnet and the pair of the contactless switches is securely mounted and a disk is turnably carried through a bearing adjacent to the electromagnet, said disk being provided at its circumference with the plurality of the permanent magnets spaced apart in the predetermined distance and opposed to the pole of the electromagnet.Still another object of the invention is to provide the driving apparatus wherein the combination of the electromagnet and the pair of the contactless switches is placed on a bottom of the mobile body, while the plurality of the permanent magnets are arranged oppositely to a core of the electromagnet along a moving direction of the mobile body on a base for its movement in the predetermined distance.A A further object of the invention is to provide the driving apparatus wherein the plurality of the permanent magnets are arranged in the moving direction of the mobile body at its bottom in the predetermined distance, while the combination of a plurality of the electromagnets and the contactless switches is arranged oppositely to the permanent magnets in the moving direction of the mobile body on the base for its movement in the predetermined distance.A still further object of the invention is to provide the driving apparatus wherein the circuit for exciting the electromagnet is connected to a DC source so as to connect the pair of the contactless switches in parallel to an exciting coil of the electromagnet and to actuate the pair of contactless switches for energizing the exciting coil of the electromagnet to the opposite polarity by means of a change over switch.A still further object of the invention is to provide the driving apparatus wherein the mobile body comprises a toy car.A furhter object of the invention is to provide the driving apparatus wherein the contactless switch comprises a lead switch for operating through magnetic action.The invention will be illustrated hereinbelow in more detail for its embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings.One way of carrying out the invention is described in detail below with reference to drawing which illustrate preferred embodiments, in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of one embodiment of a driving apparatus according to the invention Figure 2 is a side view of the driving apparatus of Fig. 1 Figure 3 shows one embodiment of a circuit for exciting the electromagnet useful in the driving apparatus according to the invention Figure 4 is a schematic view showing a basic construction of another embodiment of the driving apparatus according to the invention and Figure 5 is a schematic view showing a basic construction of a further embodiment of the driving apparatus according to the invention. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate one embodiment of the driving apparatus according to the invention, wherein a numerical reference 10 shows a base plate, on a part of which is fixed an electromagnet 12 by means of a frame 14. In this case, the frame 14 at its opposite side walls 16, 18 is provided holes, respectively, through which the pole 20 of the electromagnet is inserted to position the same at a predetermined location on the base plate 10. Further, on the frame at its one side wall is arranged a pair of contactless switches 22, 24 so as to be spaced apart at a certain gap from the pole 20 of the electromagnet 12 extending from the frame. In this case, the contactless switches 22, 24 may be constructed of, for example, a lead switch which operates through magnetic force.Then, on the frame 14 at its other wall opposite to the wall 16 provided with the contactless switches 22, 24 is arranged a turning disk 26, which is turnably supported on a bearing frame 28 fixed onto the base plate 10.Further, the turning disk 26 is provided on its circumference with a plurality of permanent magnets 30, 32, 34, 36 in a predetermined distance and with their same polarity being directed toward one direction. In this case, a shaft 38 for carrying the turning disk 26 on the base plate 10 is positioned within the same plane as the center of the pole 20 of the electromagnet 12, while each end face of the permanent magnet 30 36 on the turning disk 26 is in a close relation to an end face of the pole 20 of the electromagnet 12 with a predetermined gap. When the electromagnet 12 is aligned with any one of the permanent magnets 30 36, an attractive force namely, magnetic force is generated between the pole 20 of the non excited electromagnet 12 and one of the permanent magnet 30 36 in a close position thereto. A strength of the attractive force is proportional to a flux density present between the end faces of the pole 20 and the one of the permanent magnets 30 36, which flux density in turn is proportional to an overlapped area of the end faces of the pole 20 and the permanent magnet. Thus, if the overlapped area is too large, then the attractive force becomes also excessively strong when an electric source for energizing the electromagnet 12 is changed from OFF to ON, so that rotation of the turning disk 26 can not be smoothly started.In order to avoid such situation, as illustrated in Fig 1, each permanent magnet 30 36 is preferably positioned so that half of its end face right or left half is aligned with the end face of the pole 20.The reference will now be made to a circuit for exciting the electromagnet, as shown in Fig. 3, wherein a numerical reference 40 represents an exciting coil for the electromagnet 12. The exciting coil 40 at its one end is connected to the contactless switches 22, 24 in parallel, which in turn are connected through a change over switch 42 to a DC source 44. The DC source 44 at its center is connected to the other end of the exciting coil 40. In this case, the change over switch 42 is consisted of a double type switch having a pair of contacting pieces 46, 48, opposite to which are provided A,OFF and B contacts, respectively. The A contact of one piece 46 and the B contact of the other piece 48 are connected to the contactless switch 22, while the B contact of said one piece 46 and the A contact of said other piece 48 are connected to the contactless switch 24.Then, the piece 46 is connected to the DC source at its positive side, while the other piece 48 is connected thereto at its negative side. When the pieces 46, 48 are contacted with the B contacts, as shown in Fig. 3 and one of the contactless switches 22 is in its ON position, the current flowing therethrough is directed toward the exciting coil 40. When the contactless switch 24 is in its ON position, the current flowing therethrough is directed toward the contactless switch 24 in relation to the exciting coil 40. Thus, the exciting coil 40 may be energized to a reversible polarity depending on the switching position of the contactless switches 22, 24. Similarly, when the pieces 46, 48 of the change over switch 42 is contacted with the A contacts, the opposite situation to the above may be obtained.This operation indicates that rotation of the turning disk 26 in the reversible direction may be achieved by changing contact of the pieces 46, 48 from the B contact to the A contact. In Figs.1 and 2, a switching mechanism and a battery are illustrated as an embodiment of the change over switch 42 and the DC source 44.Now, the operation of the apparatus as shown in Figs. 1 and 2 will be described, using the circuit for exciting the electromagnet illustrated hereinabove. When the pieces 46, 48 of the change over switch 42 in the circuit are contacted to the A contacts, one of the plurality of the permanent magnets 30 36 arranged on the turning disk 26 is in a close position to the contactless switch 22 or 24 which turns to its ON position, thereby energizing the exciting coil 40 and hence the electromagnet 12. If all the permanent magnets have same S polarity in relation to the pole 20 extending from the side wall 16 of the frame 14 and the permanent switch 30 is in a close position to the contactless switch 22, then this switch 22 turns to its ON position through magnetic force of the permanent magnet 30, so that the electromagnet 12 is excited to put the polarity of the pole 20 into N.Consequently, the permanent magnet 30 in the close position to the contactless switch 22 produces an attractive force in relation to the pole 20, thereby allowing the turning disk 26 to rotate in the direction A, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2.During the rotation, inertia of the turning disk 26 is produced to continue its rotation with the permanent magnet 30 being in a close relation not to the pole 20 but to the contactless switch 24. Then, the contactless switch 24 is in its ON position through the magnetic force of the permanent magnet 30, while the contactless switch 22 is in its OFF position. Thus, the electromagnet 12 is excited with the pole 20 being in the S polarity and the permanent magnet 30 possesses also the S polarity at its end face, thereby producing a repulsive force for rotating the turning disk 26 in the directionA and allowing the permanent magnet 30 to pass over the contactless switch 24.In this way, the inertia of the turning disk 26 allows the permanent magnets 32, 34, 36 sequentially to approach the contactless switch 22, the pole 20 and then the contactless switch 24 in order and to continue its rotation for providing a rotary driving force to the shaft 38.On the contrary, when the pieces 46, 48 of the change over switch 42 in the circuit are contacted with the B contacts, the reverse operation may be achieved. Namely, the close position of the permanent magnets 30 to the contactless switch 24 puts the latter into its ON position, thereby exciting the electromagnet 24 with the pole being in the N polarity. As a result, the attractive force is produced between the permanent magnet 30 and the pole 20, allowing the turning disk 26 to rotate in the direction B, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. During this rotation, the inertia of the turning disk 26 allows the permanent magnet 30 to approach the contactless switch 22, thereby putting the latter into its ON position but the contactless switch 24 into its OFF position.Thus, the electromagnet 12 is energized with the pole 20 being in its S polarity and produces the repulsive force against the permanent magnet 30 for continuing the rotation of the turning disk 26 in the direction B. In this way, the inertia of the turning disk 26 allows the permanent magnets 36, 34, 32 sequentially to approach the contactless switch 24, the pole 20 and then the contactless switch 22 in order and to continue its rotation.When one desires to discontinue the rotation of the turning disk 26, the pieces 46, 48 of the change over switch 42 which constitutes a part of the circuit for exciting the electromagnet may be contacted to the OFF contact for discontinuing the current from the DC source to the exciting coil 40.Figure 4 shows another embodiment of the driving apparatus according to the invention.In this embodiment, a movable casing 50, such as a toy car, is provided at its bottom with the electromagnet 12, the pole 20 of which is extended through a hole of a base plate 52. The base plate 52 is provided at its outer bottom surface with a pair of the contactless switches 22, 24 in such a way that the switches 22, 24 are arranged symmetrically to the pole 20 and in the moving direction of the casing. The movable casing 50 is provided with wheels 54, as well as the change over switch 42 of the circuit for exciting the electromagnet 24 and the DC source 44. On the other hand, a base plate 56 forming a track for the movable casing is provided with a plurality of permanent magnets 30 in a plate form spaced apart each other in a certain direction. Also in the driving apparatus of this embodiment thus constructed, the electromagnet 12 arranged in the movable casing is controlled by the circuit for moving the movable casing forward or backward in the sequential direction of the permanent magnets 30. Figure 5 shows a modified embodiment of the apparatus in Fig. 4, wherein the movable casing 50 is provided at its bottom plate 52 with a plurality of the permanent magnets along the moving direction of the casing 50 in the predetermined distance, while the base plate 56 is provided with a combination of the electromagnets 12 and the corresponding pair of contactless switches 22, 24.In this case, a plurality of the combinations are preferably provided in the predetermined distance oppositely to at least one of the permanent magnets 30 arranged on the movable casing 50. Also in this embodiment, similarly to the driving apparatus of Fig. 4, the movable casing may be moved forward or backward along the sequential direction of the electromagnets under action of the electromagnets 12 and the permanent magnets 30.As apparent from the foregoing embodiments, in the driving apparatus according to the invention, a plurality of the permanent magnets 30 36 are provided on the movable or immovable body the rotary body 26 in Fig. 1 or the casing 50 in Fig. 5 with their same polarity being directed in one direction, while the electromagnet 12 is provided on the immovable the frame 12 in Fig. 1 or the base plate 56 in Fig. 5 or the movable body the casing 50 in Fig. 4 at a certain gap in relation to the permanent magnet in order to carry out either rotary or straight movement of the movable body.Especially with the driving apparatus according to the invention, a pair of the contactless switches are employed as the component of the circuit for exciting the electromagnet of the main part in the driving mechanism, and the polarity may be easily reversed by the change over switch, so that the disorder due to abrasion of electrical contact may be avoided, leading to the superior durability.Further, either rotary or straight movement may be achieved by changing the arrangement of the electromagnet and the permanent magnets, so that the driving apparatus may be applied to many type of movable toys, such as a running toy car straight movement , a merry go round rotary movement and others. In case of use in the toy car, a direct driving system may be achieved by arranging the permanent magnets with idle wheels. In this case, the driving mechanism of the toy car may be very simple, resulting in a considerable reduction in a manufacturing cost. Although the invention is described and illustrated with reference to the preferred embodiments, many changes and modifications may be carried out without departing from the scope and the spirit of the invention.Without further elaboration, the foregoing will so fully illustrate the invention that others may, by applying the current or future knowledge, readily adapt the same for use under various conditions of service.
