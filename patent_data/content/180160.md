# Method for preparing novel fluorinated organosiloxane copolymers.

## Abstract
Organosiloxane copolymers are prepared by the reaction of 1 a silane containing from 1 to 3 hydrolyzable groups and a fluorinated hydrocarbon radical that is bonded to silicon through a CH2CH2 radical, and 2 a resinous organosiloxane copolymer containing trimethylsiloxy units, SiO4 2 units and silicon bonded hydroxyl groups.
