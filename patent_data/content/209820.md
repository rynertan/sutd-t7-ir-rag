# Water and steam injection in cogeneration system.

## Abstract
A control system 48 for a cogeneration plant 10 mea sures the flow of steam 54 exceeding the requirements of the steam using process 36 . Water 46 is injected into the com bustion zone 18 of a combustor of the gas turbine 11 por tion of the cogeneration system to provide a predetermined reduction in NOx products. The excess steam 40 is added to the output of the compressor 12 portion of the gas turbine to augment the gas turbine power output due to the augmented mass flow. The control system 40 reduces the water injec tion 46 in proportion to the steam flow to maintain the total water flow to the combustion zone at a level which maintains the preferred level of NOx reduction. In a second embodiment, the excess steam is first injected 86 into the combustion zone 18 with a one for one equivalent reduction in water injection. When the excess steam exceeds the amount required for NOx reduction, the excess is added 40 tu to the output of the air compressor 12 for power augmenta tion. As the power augmentation steam is added a proportion ate reduction is made in the NOx reduction steam to account for the fact that a fraction of the output of the air compressor passes through the combustion zone.
