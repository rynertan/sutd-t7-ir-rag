# DRIVE BELT

## Abstract
A drive belt manufacture wherein tensile cords 16 are provided with a Lang twist having a ply twist constant of approximately 2.9 to 3.9 and a cable twist constant of approximately one fifth to one half of the ply twist constant. In a preferred embodiment, the tensile cords are formed of aromatic polyamide fibers and are provided with an adhe sive coating from a solution of resorcinol, formalin, and latex rubber. The invention further comprehends subjecting the cords to a pretreatment of such an adhesive solution, an epoxy resin, or an isocyanate compound. The resultant twisted cords provide improved long life characteristics for use in drive belts and the like.
