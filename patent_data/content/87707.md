# PULSE DELAY CIRCUIT

## Abstract
A pulse delay circuit uses a cascaded series of inverting elements with input thresholds to delay the transitions of an input pulse as it progresses through the series. The output of each inverter charges a capacitance in one polarity, but cannot discharge it. The discharge is achieved by current sources connected to the capacitors, charging them in a direction opposite to that of the inverter outputs. This produces a ramp which subsequently produces an abrupt transition as the ramp eventually crosses the input threshold. In this way every other inverter delays the leading edge, while the alternate intervening inverters delay the trailing edge. A final capacitance tolerant inverting element with a threshold produces abrupt transitions for each transition as its input, to create a delayed replica of the input pulse. Asymmetries in the relative delay of the leading and trailing edges are corrected either by independently controlling one of the current sources or one of the thresholds.
