# A method for sputtering a pin or nip amorphous silicon semi conductor device having partially crystallised P and N layers.

## Abstract
A high efficiency amorphous silicon PIN or NIP semicon ductor device having partially crystallised microcrystaline P and N layers is constructed by the sequential sputtering of N, I and P layers and at least one semi transparent ohmic electrode. The method of construction produces a PIN or NIP device, exhibiting enhanced electrical and optical properties, improved physical integrity, and facilitates the preparation in a singular vacuum system and vacuum pump down proce dure.
