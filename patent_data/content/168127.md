## Description
A PROCESS AND APPARATUS TO HYDROLYZELACTOSE TO GLUCOSE AND GALACTOSE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention The invention is directed to the field of hydrolyzing common basic materials into higher order more valuable materials employing immobilized proteinacious preparations bonded to a flow through reactor. More particularly, a lactose solution is hydrolyzed by a lactase system immobilized on a flow through reactor to hydrolyze substantially all of the lactose to glucose and galactose. Description of the Prior Art At present lactose is hydrolyzed to glucose and galactose using lactase only in a batch approach.All the required ingredients, including the lactose solution and the lactase enzyme are placed in a large vat which must be heated to prevent the growth of bacteria therein and the contents of the vat has its pH adjusted to the desired level and sufficient time is alloted for the conversion of the lactose to glucose and galactose. The solution is now filtered to remove the non converted lactose and the lactase enzyme and any other impurities. The enzyme is at this point considered an impurity since it may affect the taste, odor, color or appearance of the finished product and is removed and discarded.Since the vat size has certain physical limitations and the enzyme is used but once the cost of the hydrolyzation is high and the process is inefficient.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The process and apparatus to hydrolyze lactose to glucose and galactose disclosed herein overcomes the difficulties noted above with respect to prior art batch processes by providing a process and apparatus which operate on a continuous basis, to hydrolyze a continuous stream of a lactose solution employing an enzyme system which is immobilized on a flow through reactor to provide glucose and galactose from substantially all of the lactose solution provided.The immobilization of the lactase system on the flow through reactor permits its use for thousands of hours rather than the short, single batch term for which they are now used. A stream of a lactose solution, which may be approximately 5 lactose, obtained from dissolving lactose crystals in water or employing the whey stream from one or more ultra filtration devices in series, is adjusted as to its pH in a feed tank. At the same time the solution is treated to prevent the growth of bacteria by heating it to a predetermined temperature for a predetermined period, this process being better known as pasturization, or the solution is recirculated through an ultra violet radiation unit. The pasturization step will require that the solution be cooled to the proper temperature before introduction into the flow through reactor.The reactor may take the form of a stack of microporous sheets with the solution introduced perpendicular to the major surface of the sheets or it may take the form of a spiral jelly roll configuration with the solution introduced into its porous core or its open free end. The solution moves generally between the reactor convolutions but may also pass through the microporous sheets which define the reactor convolutions. Various filters, detection devices, recorders, etc. are employed to maximize the overall efficiency of the conversion process. It is an object of this invention to provide a method and apparatus for the continuous conversion of lactose to glucose and galactose using a flow through reactor. It is an object of this invention to provide a method and apparatus for the continuous conversion of lactose to glucose and galactose where said lactose is provided as a solution from the dissolving of crystals of lactose in water.

It is still a further object of this invention to provide a method and apparatus for the continuous converion of lactose to glucose and galactose where said lactose is provided as a solution from whey permeate discharged from an ultra filtration system comprising at least two ultra filtration units in series with a clarity determining device that recirculates the output whey permeate back to one of the ultra filtration units if the clarity is too low indicating that the whey permeate contains too much suspended solid matter. It is another object of this invention to provide a method and apparatus for the continuous conversion of lactose to glucose and galactose and where the lactose is in a solution continuously recirculated through a source of ultra violet radiation prior to processing to prevent the growth of bacteria in said solution. Other objects and features of the invention will be pointed out in the following description and claims and illustrated in the accompanying drawings, which disclose, by way of example, the principles of the invention, and the best modes which have been contemplated for carrying them out.

FIG. 7 is a schematic representation of a subsystem used to determine the amount of solid material suspended in the lactose solution. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERED EMBODIMENTS The basic concept of the present invention is to provide a method and apparatus for the continuous hydrolyzation of lactose in a lactose solution into glucose and galactose by passing such lactose solution through a flow through reactor which has immobilized thereon a proteinacous substance such as the enzyme lactase. The enzyme, because it is immobilized on a suitable porous or specially configured support, does not become a part of the glucose and galactose and can be used a great number of times making the conversion operation far less expensive. Also because the system is a continuous one, the equipment required is greatly reduced. For example no large vat and heating system for such vat is required. In order that the reactor be used properly it is necessary to adjust the pH, the temperature and the transit time of the solution through the flow through reactor. Excess solids must be removed from the converted solution based upon the reactor system employed. Turning now to FIG. 1 there is shown a first form of apparatus 10 for the continuous hydrolyzation of lactose into glucose and galactose.Lactose crystals obtained, for example, from the crystallization of lactose found in milk whey is dissolved in water to give a 5 lactose solution and supplied via input line 12 to a feed tank 14 used to maintain a constant flow of lactose solution through the apparatus 10. Although the solution is a 5 solution, the effective lactose concentration can be in the range of to or higher. Due to the possible presence of unwanted materials such as fat globules, salts, trace amounts of protein or other milk solids which can block the pores of the flow through reactor as hereinafter set forth, the lactose solution is passed via line 16 to a filter 18.Filter 18 can be made up of a single unit to pass only particles below a given size or can be constructed of a series of graduated filter elements so that particles below a given can be passed through the last filter element. The filtered lactose solution is then passed via line 20 into a tank 22 where the lactose solution is heated to the desired temperature and the pH is adjusted. The incoming lactose solution is generally slightly acidic having a pH of approximately 6.5. The lactase used in the reactor is an acid lactase and accordingly the lactose solution must be made more acidic to a pH of 4.5. This is accomplished by the addition to the lactose solution in tank 22 of sulphuric acid, hydrocloric acid or acetic acid.For the particular lactase enzyme system chosen the temperature of the lactose solution must be raised to a tem perature of 30 to 40 C from room temperature of approx 0 imately 21µ C. This may be accomplished, for example, by the use of an immersed heating coil not shown in tank 22. The lactose solution, now at the desired temperature and pH is conducted via line 24 into the reactor 26. Alternatively, the positions of the filter 18 and the tank 22 can be reversed. This may be desireable in situations where the acid used to adjust the pH has not been filtered and any particles present must be removed before the solution is passed to the reactor 26 or in case the pasturization of the solution causes coagulation and the precipitants must also be removed prior to introduction into reactor 26. Reactor 26 is made up of one or more reactor modules not shown , each of which comprises a plurality of stacked microporous sheets having a plurality of pores extending fromteir respective surfaces. These pores are not continuous, but rather form a random tortuous pathway. One type of microporous sheet is shown and described in United States Letters Patent No 4,102,746 issued 25 July 1978 in the name of Bruce S. Goldberg and assigned to the assignee of the instant invention. In addition other pastic and rubber sheets can be used.Proteinaceous preparation, for example exzymes, can be immobilized upon the silica frag ments on the surface of the sheeting and in the pores of the sheeting employing the techniques described in the 4,102,746 patent and in UnitedStates Letters Patent No 4,169,014 issued 25September 1979 in the name of Bruce S. Goldberg and also assigned to the assignee of the instant invention. Other suitable techniques are also known in the prior art. In the instant case reactor 26 has an acidic lactase enzyme system immobilized on the microporous sheets of the reactor 26. By controlling the pressure and volume of the lactose solution applied to the reactor 26, and by employing a suitable number of micorporous sheets in the reactor modules as well as the configuration of the internal duct work of the reactor 26 not show , the time required to pass through reactor 26, called the transit time, can be controlled to give a high rate of conversion of the lactose to glucose and galactose. It has been found that employing a 5 lactose solution at 300 C, with a pH of 4.5 and a transit time of 2 minutes through reactor 26, there is a 90 conversion of the lactose to glucose and galactose.These components as well as the unconverted lactose solution is fed via output line 28 to suitable storage or immediate use as a sweetener or food ingredient. If desired the non converted lactose may be removed before the glucose and galactose are employed. To use the reactor 26 as described above is is necessary to carefully filter the lactose solution to remove any fat globules, coagulants, cheese or milk solids which are present and which singlely or in combination can block the pores of the reactor and prevent the flow through of the lactose solution. This condition is sometimes referred to in the art as blinding the reactor or filter. To permit the use of unfiltered feedstocks and to prevent the accidental blinding of the reactor, a spiral reactor may be employed instead. This reactor, also made up of microporous sheets, is formed into a jelly roll spiral configuration with each convolution separated from adjacent convolutions by spacing means which permit the solution to flow between the convolutions and in contact with the sheet surfaces upon which the enzyme is immobilized. A porous core and an open free end permit the lactose solution to be placed in the reactor and the reaction products removed.Such a jelly roll spiral reactor is disclosed in a copending application for a United States Letter Patent Serial No filed in the name of Bruce S. Goldberg and Richard Y. Chen entitled Spiral Designed Reactor and assigned to the assignee of the instant invention. One form of apparatus 30 using a jelly roll spiral configured reactor 32 is shown in FIG 2.The lactose solution is supplied via input line 12 to feed tank 14. The output of feed tank 14 passes line 16 to tank 22 where the lactose solution is heated to the desired temperature and the pH is adjusted. The output of tank 22 is feed via line 20 to the spiral reactor 32. Since the output of reactor 32 may contain undesired solids and fat these may be removed by means of filter 34 arranged to remove the undesired materials passed to filter 34 via line 24. The filtered glucose and galactose and remaining unconverted lactose solution is available on output line 28 for whatever is its intended use. In the making of cheese an enzyme called rennet is added to the whole milk to curdle it. The curd is the cheese and the remainder is the whey. Whey is about 93 to 94 water and 6 to 7 solids consisting of protein, salts such as sodium chloride, potassium phosphate and lactose. On a weight basis for each 10 pounds of whole milk, there is 1 pound of cheese and 9 pounds of whey. In the previous examples, the lactose was separated out from the whey and crystallized and the lactose solution was produced by dissolving the lactose crystals in water. The lactose solution can also be obtained directly from the whey by the use of a membrane type separation device or ultrafiltration system of the type commercially available from DEC International Inc. of Fond DuLac, Wisconsin and having a 20,000 to 40,000 molecular weight cut off.The ultra filtration system receives the whey and produces at one output whey protein concentrate or retentate and at the second output permeate which is comprised of 95 water, 1 2 salts, 4 1 2 lactose and trace amounts of protein. The dried protein powder can be used as a food enricher when suitably dried.The presence of residual protein in the whey permeate can be detected and the permeate run through a second ultra filtration system called a polisher which is like the one described above except that the molecular weight cut off is 20,000. Alternatively, upon the detection of more than an insignificant amount of residual protein, the permeate can be recirculated through the first ultra filtration again. FIG. 3 shows an apparatus 40 for the continuous hydrolyzation of lactose into glucose and galactose and employing whey as the starting material. Whey from the cheese making vats is feed via input line 12 into nltra filtration system 42. At output line 44 the whey protein concentrate or retentate is removed while the whey permeate is available at output line 46. The permeate is applied to the ultra filtration polisher 48 to remove any residual protein which passed through ultra filtration system 42. Protein removed by polisher 48 is available on line 50 while the permeate is available on line 52.The permeate is placed in vat 22 to have its pli adjusted. The pH of the incoming permeate is determined and sufficient acid to lower the pR of the permeate in vat 22 is added by the device 54 connected to vat 22 by line 56. Devices to perform this function are sold by Horizon Incorporated. In that the lactose solution in vat 22 is an ideal growth medium for bacteria, something must be done to prevent such growth. Two procedures are available to destroy the bacteria present in vat 22 and prevent their growth. A first, akin to pasturization, amounts to raising the temperature of the lactose solution in vat 22 to approximately 1600 F 7 C for a prescribed period and the second requires the continuous recirculai ion of the lactose solution through a source of ultra violet radiation to irradiate such solution. The heating technique is shown in FIG 4 where a heating coil 58 coupled to a thermostatic control 60 is immersed in the lactose solution in vat 22.Since the temperature of the lactose solution is raised to approximately 71 C it is necessary that the solution in line 70 be cooled in cooler 62 before it is applied to reactor 26. Alternately, a source of ultra violet radiation 64, as shown in FIG 5 can be used to continually irradiate the lactose solution as it is recirculated from vat 22, via line 66 to the ultra violet radiation source 64 and back to vat 22 via line 68.This constant recirculation kills any bacteria present. Since the irradiation is carried out at room temperature, approximately 680 F or 2r C it is necessary to warm the solution temperature to the desired 30 to 40 C range. This can be done by the uSe of a heater such as 58, 60 in FIG 4 in vat 22 not shown . Also since the solution will be raised to the correct temperature in vat 22 no cooler such as 62 needs to be employed. The cooler 62 may be made using coils not shown in unit 62 through which refrigerated water is passed. The lactose solution of proper pH and temperature is now conducted via line 72 to the filter unit 18 which is made up of a 2 micron filter cartridge of the type made by Cox ManufacturingCompany followed by a 0.45 micron filter cartridge of the type made by Gelman Filter Company. After filtration in filter 18, the 5 lactose solution adjusted to the proper pH 4.5, heated to 30e C, and having all solids above a predetermined size removed is applied to reactor 26. As with the apparatus 10 and 20, the apparatus 40 will achieve a 90 conversion rate with a two minute transit time in the reactor 26. The glucose and galactose and non converted lactose are available on output line 28. Turning now to FIG 6 a more detailed apparatus 80 is shown along with some of the housekeeping equipment required to keep all components of the system clean especially necessary when the end products are intended for human consumption. Only a single ultra filtration system 42 is shown but it should be understood that if required or desired a polisher can be added. Alternatively a feed back system can be employed to cause the permeate to be returned to the ultra filtrati n system input if it contains two much suspended matter such as protein. FIG 7 shows how this can be done using a turbidity meter 82. The output line 46 from ultra filtration system 42 is fed to turbidity meter 82. Normally this permeate should be clear and sparkling and have a turbidity reading of much less than 3 national turbidity units NTU . If this is the case the permeate is passed to the continuation of output line 46 to vat 22. If the turbidity is above 3 NTU then the solution is gated to line 84 which returns it to input line 12 for a second pass through the ultra filtration system 42. An alarm system can be connected to turbidity meter 82 to advise of successive failures to attain the desired turbidity level indicating trouble with the ultrafiltration system 42 ie a ruptured membrane or the like . Returning to FIG 6, the permeate from ultrafiltration system 42 is placed in vat 22, which also receives acid from pH control 54 via line 56, and the recirculated lactose solution from the ultraviolet radiation unit 64 via recirculation line 68.A valve 86 controls the flow of the lactose solution from vat 22 via lines 79 and 66 to the ultra violet radiation unit 64. A valve 88 is provided to permit the draining of the solution in vat 22. To prevent settling in the vat 22 a mechanical agitator 90 is coupled by linkage 92 to vat 22. Valve 94 controls the flow of the solution in the recirculation line 68 and pump 96 provides the necessary head for movement of the solution. Valve 94 is open approximately half of the time so that half of the solution in the recirculation path can be directed to the filtration systems 18a and 18b. The solution leaving the recirculation path passes through flow meter 98 to the distribution valve 100 input 102 and from first output 104 to the first filter unit 18a made up of course filter 74a 2 micron and fine filter 766 0.45 micron . The pump 96 is arranged to provide a constant rate of flow through flow meter 98 to the first unit 18a.When the filter unit 18a is clean and the solution flows easily through filter unit 18a the power required by the pump 96 is constant. However, as fat globules, coagulants, cheese solids and other materials deposit on the filter materials of filter unit 18a and blind them the flow through flow meter 98 slows and the pump 96 is required to apply more force to the solution, drawing more current and trying to maintain a constant flow through flow meter 98. When the rate of flow through flow meter 98 falls below a predetermined value, flow meter 98 operates distribution valve 100 via mechanical linkage 108 to switch its output to its second output 106 which in turn is connected the second filter unit 186 made up of course filter 74b 2 micron and fine filter 76b 0.45 micron . Flow meters of the type described are available from Brooks FlowMeter Co.When second filter unit 18b blinds the entire apparatus 80 will be shut down for cleaning. The outputs from first filter unit 18a and second filter unit 18b are applied to inputs 112 and 114, respectively of valve 110 which in turn applies its output on 116 to line 118 leading to the cooling unit or heat exchanger 62. Heat exchanger 62 corrects the temperature of the lactose solution applied to line 72 to that required for proper operation of the reactor 26. A temperature recorder 120 is connected via line 122 to record the temperature of the solution flowing in line 72. Similarly, a pH recorder 124 is coupled via line 126 to record the pH of the solution flowing in line 72. Both recorders 120 and 124 can be equipped with alarms to signal that the solution flowing in line 72 is outside of the desired temperature and pH range. Valves 128 and 132 control the flow of the lactose solution in line 72 to the reactor 26.Valve 130 is provided to permit the line 72 to be drained or directed elsewhere. The reactor 26 is made up of a plurality of reactor modules 134 separated from adjacent modules by the plates 136 and 138. The plates 136 are each coupled to the input header 140 to apply the lactose solution to the two modules 134 adjacent thereto. Alternating with the plates 136 are plates 138 each coupled through a valve 142 to the output header 144 and in turn to the output line 28. The plates 138 prevent the solution from going beyond the modules adjacent thereto so that if these modules become contaminated in any way the contaminents will not reach any additional modules. Also this arrangement insures a more even distribution of the solution throughout the reactor 26.Similarly the plates 138 only cooperate with the modules 134 directly adjacent further facilitating substantially even flow throughout the reactor. Valves 142 can be used to limit or cut off flow from the plates 138 to the output header 144 if desired.Normally the valves 142 are fully open. Although only nine reactors 134 are shown this number can be increased or decreased as desired. Sires the reaction produ ts can be used for human consumption and are based upon dairy components the overall apparatus must be cleaned on a regular basis. Also it should be noted that most of the tanks, piping, valves and similar elements are constructed of stainless steel.A clean in place solution is stored in tank 150 which can be drained through valve 152 if required. The cleaning solution can only be used for a single pass through the apparatus 80.Thus more solution can be entered into tank 150 via inlet pipe 154. The cleaning solution in tank 150 is permitted to enter the apparatus 80 by opening the valve 156 which connects to feed line 66. To prevent the backflow of the cleaning solution into vat 22 valve 86 is closed. It should be noted that the valves used in apparatus 80 may be manually operated or electrically operated at the valve itself or remote therefrom.The cleaning solution passes through the ultraviolet radiation system not operative at such times , pump 96 and valve 94 into vat 22. Valve 94 is then closed and the cleaning solution is directed through flow meter 98 to valve 100 which alternately applies the solution to the first filter unit 18a and then the second filter unit lSb. Valve 110 applies the cleaning solution to heat exchanger 62 and through valves 128 and 130 to the drain.Valve 132 is closed at this time to ensure that the solution does not reach reactor 26. A buffer solution is now applied to the reactor 26 from tank 160 via valve 162, pump 164, flow meter 166 and valve 168 to input header 140. The buffer solution can also be recirculated back to tank 160 prior to use on reactor 26 by opening valve 170. New buffer solution can be added to tank 160 via inlet pipe 172 and the tank 160 can be drained via valve 174.
