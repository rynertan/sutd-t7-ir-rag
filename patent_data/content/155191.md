## Description
This invention relates to a method of manufacturing a material primarily for use in electrical insulation and also to electrically insulating material manufactured according to the method. Mica is well known as an excellent insulating material as it has a high dielectric strength with a great resistance to electrical stress and discharge, is resistant to deterioration an is relatively flexible. One method of utilising mica is in the form of a sheet or strip formed by bonding mica particles together to form a compact coherent layer, usually on a backing sheet of flexible insulating material such as woven glass cloth or plastics sheet.An object of the invention is to provide a method of manufacturing electrlcally insulating material of sheet or strip form utilising mica particles which results in a product having especially good electrical properties. According to the invention a method of forming electrically insulating material of sheet or strip form comprises the steps of forming a slurry or mica flakes in a hardenable liquid resin, forming a layer of such slurry of a thickness such that there is an overlapping of the mica flakes, and consolidating the layer so formed by pressure. It has been found that the application of pressure allows closer approach of the mica surfaces one to another, the close proximity of the surfaces allowing for the interaction of Van der Waals forces to pull the flakes into alignment, and this has been found to result in a product having improved electrical and mechanical properties. Alignment of the mica flakes may be achieved by the application of pressure alone, or with heating to soften the resin. The applied pressure will depend on the resin softness but is usually at least 5.0 MPa. The resin sheet or strip containing aligned mica flakes can be produced by this technique with or without a backing layer. However it has been found that the most practical approach is to coat a base material, of sheet or strip form formed for example of glass cloth or polyester film with the mica containing resin slurry by single side or dip process, and subsequently hot pressing the coated material to align the mica flakes. The electrically insulating material made according to the invention may be applied at room temperature to prestrengthened or non prestrengthened bunches of conductors or individual conductors in the form of wide films or strips made therefrom and can be further consolidated or hardened under pressure by heat treatment. The liquid resin employed is preferably a thermosetting resin and may be in monomeric or polymeric form, with or without a solvent. If a solvent is used the mica containing resin layer is preferably heated prior to the pressing step to effect removal of the solvent. Instead of a thermosetting resin a thermoplastic resin can in some cases be employed. The choice of resin and base materIal, where provided, will be governed by the particular application and thermai class of the euipn ent which is to be insulated, that is to say the maximum temperature to which the insulation will normally be expected to be subjected in use of the equipment. Examples of suitable resins and taste materials for different thermal classes of equipment are as follows Base Resin Thermal Property a1 Polyester Film Epoxy Class F b Polyester Film Polyester Class F c Glass Silicone Class H d Polyimide Film Polyimide Class H and Class C e Polyether etherketone Polyimide Class C P.E.E.K. Film Sheets of insulating material may be produced in accordance with the invention by a batch process by using a platen press for the consolidation step or by a continuous process using calendering equipment on the film screed. A sheet formed by either of these processes may be cut into strips to form tape if required. The resultant product, in its preferred form, comprises a flexible semi cured thermosetting sheet material on a soft thermoplastic sheet material, which can be used to provide an insulating covering over one or more conductors the thermosetting material may be further press heated and fully cured by the user. However, in addition to its use for insulating electrical machines, material manufactured in accordance with the invention may be used as a dielectric in capacitors. Two specific methods which have been emplcyed for the manufacture of insulating sheet or tape in accordance with the invention will now be described by way of example.Example 1 Mica Grade FDP5 as supplied by MicrofineMinerals and Chemicals Ltd., Derby was thoroughly blended with a polyester resin in a solvent, such as 1093 015 Porters Paints , in proportions 50 mica and 500i6 resin by weight.
