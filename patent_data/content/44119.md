# Process for the preparation of copolymers of ethylene with at least one other 1 alkene.

## Abstract
Process for the preparation of copolymers consisting of 25 85 by wt. of ethylene, 15 75 by wt. of at least one other 1 alkene and optionally up to 20 by wt. of a polyunsatu rated compound with application of a catalyst system containing a compound of a metal from sub groups IV VI of the periodic system and a compound of a metal from groups I III of the periodic system, in which at least one hydrocarbon group is bound directly to the metal atom via a carbon atom, the polymerization being carried out in the presence of a halogen containing compound of the general formula
