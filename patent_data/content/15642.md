# Acoustically lagged structure.

## Abstract
An acoustically lagged structure with improved low frequency attenuation has acoustic lagging in the form of a fibrous blanket 2 provided with an external cladding skin 5 held in spaced relationship from the component, e.g. pipe 1 , to be lagged by spacing members 4 . The blanket 2 and or spacing members 4 are resilient to avoid mechanical close coupling of the skin 5 and com ponent.
