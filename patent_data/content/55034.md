# BUILDING ARCH

## Abstract
The invention is a building arch for use in constructing a frame for a building. An arch comprises several rigid strut units 1,2,3,4 each having two spaced booms OB, IB in pin jointed connection with one another. One boom OB or IB of each unit is pin joint ed directly to one boom of a successive unit to form a chain, and the other boom IB or OB of each same unit is connected to the other boom of the same successive unit by way of a link 7 pin jointed to the said other booms to form another chain. Arches of different contours may be formed using strut units of the same dimensions by varying the number of strut units employed and by employing links of different lengths.
