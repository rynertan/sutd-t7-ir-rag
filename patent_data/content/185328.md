## Description
Display Control System The present invention relates to a display control system provided with digital interfaces. Current display systems of both monochrome and color monitors can have either digital or analogue interfaces. In general, the monochrome monitor system using aCRT or liquid crystal is more common than the color monitor system, because the former is less expensive than the latter. On the other hand, however, since the use of the color monitor system is gradually increasing, a large amount of software using a color display is now found on the market. In the display system with digital interfaces, when the software utilizing the colqr display is executed by the conventional system using a monochrome monitor, there is a problem in that the display contents thereof can not be distinguished from one another. This is because the above mentioned conventional monochrome monitor system is only able to perform a black and white display and not discriminate between display colors. Also, in order to be able to distinguish colors from one another in the system using a digital interface monochrome monitor, color code information may be read out prior to writing into a VRAM, the read out color code information may be converted into a hatch pattern signal, and then the converted hatch pattern signal may be written again into the VRAM. However, there arises another problem that other kinds of software are necessary to realize this . In view of the above mentioned circumstances in the prior art, an object of the present invention is to eliminate or at least mitigate the drawbacks found in the above mentioned conventional display control system. Another object of the invention is to provide an improved display control system for use in a display system with digital interfaces, which, when software utilizing a color display is executed in the above mentioned display system, is capable of distinguishing the resultant display contents from one another. According to the invention, different kinds of brightness information having duties different from one another are issued correspondingly to different kinds of color code information or brightness code information respectively dots on a display screen are established in two areas which are located adjacently to each other and, the above mentioned brightness information to be given to one of the above mentioned two areas is shifted in phase with the brightness information to be given to the other area. Also, correspondingly to dot positions and raster positions in display means, the above mentioned code information may also be converted into a hatch pattern. The above and other related objects and features of the invention will be apparent from a reading of the following description of preferred embodiments of the invention with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a general view of one embodiment of the present invention Fig. 2 is a table to illustrate in part 1 0 registers included in a display system shown in Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is a block diagram of another embodiment of the invention Fig. 4 is a view to illustrate the relationship between the code and brightness information in the above embodiment Fig. 5 is a view to illustrate a portion of display means suitable for use in carrying out the invention Fig. 6 is a table to illustrate the patterns of aROM shown in Fig. 3 Fig. 7 is a block diagram of a further embodiment of the invention Fig. 8 is a table to illustrate the patterns of aROM shown in Fig. 7 Fig. 9 is a block diagram of another embodiment of the invention Fig. 10 is a block diagram of a further embodiment of the invention Fig. 11 is a view to illustrate an embodiment of hatch pattern conversion means suitable for use in carrying out the invention Fig. 12 is a view to illustrate 8 patterns respectively provided by the above hatch pattern conversion means and, Fig. 13 is a table to illustrate the respective patterns in a hexadecimal notation. Referring first to Fig. 1, there is illustrated a block diagram of an embodiment of the invention. A display system 10 is a system which controls the display of an LCD or a CRT. Display System 10 includes a CRT controller 11, a driver 12 for amplifying data signals, an attribute graphic 13, an alpha 14, a color selector 15, a color palette 16 for performing a color conversion, a composite color generator CG, and a mode select register 71.CRT Controller 11 is used to generate a timing signal in accordance with a parameter when it is set. Color Selector 15 outputs a 4 bit digital signal for specifying a color, when a color CRT is used as display means 20. Composite Color Generator CG has code information brightness information conversion means CG1, CG2, and CG3.These code information brightness information conversion means CG1, CG2, CG3 respectively generate the brightness information of duties different from each other correspondingly to the respective color code information or brightness code information, and also shift the above mentioned bright ness information in a predetermined area from the brightness information in other areas in phase. The shift amount is about 180 degrees. Display System 10 further includes an internal control register 18 and circuits shown in Fig. 1. For Display Means 20, a CRT or an LCD can be used. Externally of Display System 10, there are provided aVRAM a RAM for video 30 consisting of a DRAM or a SRAM, an address latch 31 for latching an address signal from aCPU, a data latch 32 for latching data from Display System 10, a character generator 33 for converting character information into dots according to a signal from Data Latch 32, and an external control register 34 for receiving data from Internal Control Register 18. Next, we will give an outline of the operation of the above mentioned embodiment of the invention. Referring here to Fig. 2, there is illustrated a table to show a portion of an I O register contained in DisplaySystem 10. This I O register is provided with a plurality of register functions which differ from one another. Here, to display characters on the CRT as Display Means 20, data signals from the CPU not shown are once written into VRAM via Driver 12. Display System 10 reads out VRAM 30 repeatedly to the synchronization scanning of the CRT. The thus read out data are latched by Data Latch 32. The data are converted into dots by Character Generator 33 and Alpha 14, then converted into color signals by Color Selector 15 and finally sent to the CRT. On the other hand, when it is desired to perform a color conversion, Color Palette 16 is used. The above mentioned color signals are D A converted by Composite Color Generator CG and the resultant Y signals are sent to the CRT. In this case, since Display Means 20 is not a color monitor, the execution of the above mentioned color conversion operation means the brightness conversion. On the other hand, when the LCD is employed as DisplayMeans 20, the D A conversion of the color signals in Composite Color generator CG is not carried out, but other operation is used to control the display of the LCD. Referring now to Fig. 3, there is illustrated a block diagram of an example of code information brightness information conversion means employed in the invention. In this figure, EXOR Circuit 50 is an exclusive or operation circuit which receives a line count 0 signal and a dot count 0 signal. Line Count O Signal is LSB O bit signal of a line count signal, while Dot Count O Signal isLSB O bit signal of a dot count signal. When the output of EXOR Circuit 50 is 0 , then signals shown by solid lines in Fig. 4 are output from ROM51 and areas shown by oblique solid lines in Fig. 5 are displayed.When the output of EXOR Circuit 50 is 1 , then signals shown by broken lines in Fig. 4 are output from ROM51 and areas shown by oblique broken lines in Fig. 5 are displayed.EXOR Circuit 50 is adapted to create so called checkered selection switching signals on Display Means 20. ROM 51 is adapted to output the brightness information of different duties from one another correspondingly to the respective color code information AO, Al, A2 received fromColor Palette 16. The relationship between the above mentioned color code information and brightness information is illustrated in Fig. 4. For example, when the color code information is 110 , if the output of EXOR Circuit 50 is 0 , then a parallel signal shown by a solid line in which only the first frame thereof is Low is output, while if the output of EXORCircuit 50 is 1 , then a parallel singal shown by a broken line in which only the fourth frame thereof is Low is output. Selector 52 is adapted to output the signal out of the output signals of ROM 51 that corresponds to the number of frames. In the above mentioned case, 8 frames 0 7 are used and the frame number is determined according to frame count 0, 1, 2 signals. In Fig. 3, reference CGi designates code information brightness information conversion means. Next, we will describe the operation of the above mentioned embodiment of the invention. A given piece of color code information is output fromColor Palette 16 and, according to this given color code information, brightness code information is output, as shown in Fig. 4. In this case, if the output of EXOR Circuit 50 is O , 1 , then the signals are output in the wave forms respectively shown by the solid and broken lines in Fig. 4.And, Selector 52 outputs a 1 bit signal in accordance with the then frame, which signal is then transmitted to DisplayMeans 20. Therefore, in the above embodiment, even when a certain dot is being displayed with the same brightness at a certain instance, if the then frame is different, the average brightness of the dot is also different so as to be able to display an intermediate brightness. And, the intermediate brightness is made to correspond to its associated color and thus, even in a monochrome monitor, differences between colors can be recognized visually. Also, since every dot of DisplayMeans 20 is displayed by a signal which is different in phase, a flicker is also 180 degrees out of phase so that flickers cancel each other to become quiet. Fig. 6 is a table to illustrate the patterns of ROM 51 shown in Fig. 3. Now, in Fig. 7, there is illustrated a block diagram of a second embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, a single ROM 51a is used to take the place of EXOR Circuit 50 and ROM 51 in Fig. 3. In Fig. 7, reference CG2 designates code information brightness information conversion means. The patterns of the above mentioned ROM Sla are shown inFig. 8. In Fig. 8, reference characters A, B designate the same portions as with A, B in Fig. 6, respectively. Now in Fig. 9, there is illustrated a block diagram of a third embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, a single ROM 51b is employed to take the place of ROM 51a and Selector 52. In this figure, reference CG3 designates code information brightness information conversion means. It should be noted that the operations of the embodiments illustrated in Figs. 7 and 9 are similar to that of the embodiment in Fig. 3. Although in the foregoing explanation the code information brightness information conversion means or circuit is composed of a ROM and an EXOR circuit for purposes of generalization of the description, it is also possible to make an equivalent circuit by using other elements such as AND,OR, INV and the like. Referring now to Fig. 10, there is illustrated a block diagram of a fourth embodiment of the invention. In this figure, Code Information Output Circuit 110 is adapted to output color code information or brightness code information in accordance with the memory contents of VRAM Video RAM 120. In this embodiment, the output information of Code Information Output Circuit 10 is output in the form of 3 bit signals. Ratch Pattern Conversion Means 130 converts the abovementioned code information into hatch patterns and then outputs them bit by bit. In this case, Hatch Pattern ConversionMeans 130 outputs signals in accordance with the dot position and line position raster position in CRT 140. In Fig. 11, there is illustrated an embodiment of HatchPattern Conversion Means 130 employed in the above embodiment of the invention. Hatch Pattern Conversion Means 130 has 8 patterns pages which are different from one another in gradation. The examples of these 8 patterns are illustrated in Fig. 12.Each of the 8 patterns is composed of a character box including 8 dots x 8 dots the portions thereof shown by oblique lines represent black dots on CRT 140 and, the portions with no oblique lines stand for white dots on CRT 140. In accordance with the above mentioned color code inforamtion, one pattern is selected out of the 8 patterns and, in accordance with the lower 3 bits of the then line count signal, one line is selected out of eight lines 0 7.At the same time, in accordance with the lower 3 bits of a dot count signal, one dot is selected out of eight dots 0 7. In this way, a specified signal is output from Selector 131, and then a next signal which corresponds to a next dot will be output from Selector 131 similarly. In Fig. 13, the above mentioned patterns are expressed in a hexadecimal notation, respectively. Next, we will describe the operation of the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 10. One of the above mentioned patterns 0 7 is first selected according to a certain piece of the color code information since the respective pieces of the color code infor mation or the brightness code information correspond to the respective patterns 0 7 illustrated in Fig. 12. For example, it is assumed that a pattern shown in Fig.11 pattern 1 is selected. Also, it is supposed that a position on CRT 140 is being scanned in which the lower 3 bits of the line count signal are 0 and the lower 3 bits of the dot count signal are 0 . In this case, from Fig. 11,Hatch Pattern Conversion Means 130 then outputs 0 and a white color is displayed on CRT 140. Also, in case when another position on CRT 140 is being scanned in which the lower 3 bits of the line count signal are 0 and the lower 3 bits of the dot count signal are 3 , from Fig. 11, HatchPattern Conversion Means 130 then outputs 1 and a black color is displayed on CRT 140. In this way, the dots are converted into the associated patterns dot by dot. When the lower 3 bits of the dot count signal become 7 , then they become 0 , so that the abovementioned operations are repeated again. Similarly, when the lower 3 bits of the line count signal become 7 , then they become 0 , so that the above mentioned operations are repeated again. When the color code information is varied somewhere in the movement of the above mentioned dots or lines that is, halfway along the scanning , Hatch Pattern Conversion Means 130 is operated in accordance with the pattern that corresponds to the color code information. Therefore, the hatch patterns to be displayed on CRT 140 are varied according to the color code information and such variations of the hatch patterns occur in dots. As a result of this, when software for colors is applied in a monochrome monitor, there is provided an advantage that differences between the colors can be recognized accurately. Now, it should be noted that the unit of the hatch patterns may be arbitrary in size, that is, it may be m dot s x n dot s m, n are arbitrary integers, respectively in size. Also, the number of kinds of the hatch patterns may be other than 8, and the hatch patterns may comprise other arbitrary designs than those illustrated herein. Further, although in the embodiment of Fig. 11 the signal is selected in accordance with the dot count signal, alternatively, either of the other elements the color code information or the line count signal may be selected. In addition, a liquid crystal may be used in place of CRT 140. As described hereinbefore, the present invention has two effects that it has software compatibility and that the time necessary for its processings can be reduced, because it is capable of recognizing the differences between colors even in a system using a digital interface monochrome monitor.
