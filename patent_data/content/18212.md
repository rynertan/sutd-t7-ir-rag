# Neutralised phosphated elastomeric polymer products and their preparation.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a process for the manufac ture of a neutralized phosphonated ethylene propylene copolymer having 1 to 150 moles of PO₃H₂ groups which are neutralized with certain metal cations or the ammo nium cation. Elastomeric compositions used for elastomeric articles include neutralized phosphonated ethylene propy lene copolymers having 20 to 200 parts by weight of a non polar process oil per 100 parts by weight of a filler per 100 parts of the phosphonated copolymer, and a preferen tial plasticiser can also be incorporated into the compo sition. These blend compositions can be readily processed on conventional plastic fabrication equipment into elasto meric articles having excellent physical properties and desirable rubber characteristics.
