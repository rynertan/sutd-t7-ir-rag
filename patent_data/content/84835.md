## Abstract
A hydraulic system comprising a reversible variable displacement pump 10 , a hydraulic servo motor 14, 15 for controlling the direction and amount of displacement of the pump 10 , a fluid motor 13 connected in parallel to the pump 10 and adapted to be driven by the pump 10 , a pilot operated directional valve 23 for controlling the position and direction of the servo motor system 14, 15 , and a valve 21 for sensing the displacement of said pump 10 and applying a force to the directional valve 23 opposite to the force of the pilot pressure from 24 for moving the valve 23 .
