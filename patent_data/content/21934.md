## Abstract
A motion compensating system for use with a crane hoist 10 and control system therefore serve to assist a crane operator in safely lifting loads from the deck of a heaving work boat 32 . The crane hook 28 is allowed to follow the motion of the load 30 because a level of pre tension is maintained on the line wire rope 22 by means of a counterweight 44 connected to a four part reeving system 24 in the line. A hydraulic damping cylinder 48 in connected to the counter weight to provide a means of locking movement of the coun terweight and also provides a cushion at both ends of the travel of the counterweight, movement of the piston in the cylinder being controlled by means of a control system.
