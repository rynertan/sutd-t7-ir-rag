# Methof for cladding a wire shaped steel element with an aluminium coating, as well as aluminium coated wire shaped steel element.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a method for cladding a wire shaped steel element 1 with an aluminium coating layer 3 by passing the steel wire 1 through an extrusion orifice 8 , whereby plastified aluminium is fed through a closed feed channel 7 preceding the orifice 8 and is applied under pressure on the wire shaped steel element 1 in the orifice 8 for forming the coating 3 . According to the invention, the steel wire 1 is provided with a corrosion resistant layer 2 with a thickness of 1 to 25 micron, which layer 2 has a lower melting temperature than the melting temperature of the aluminium to be applied and whereby during the coating process the temperature of the protective layer 2 which comes in contact with the aluminum remains lower than the melting temperature of the layer 2 . This invention also relates to coated steel wires accord ing to the invention.
