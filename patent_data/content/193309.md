# Paper diaper.

## Abstract
A paper diaper shown in Figure 1 comprises, from the top, a fluff pulp surface layer of ply 1, holed or grooved partition layer 3, diffusion crust layer 5 and fluff pulp main layer or ply 7, all wrapped up in nonwoven fabric 10, 10 . Fluid discharged is absorbed in an area R and passes through area R and falls down through the partition layer 3 onto the crust layer 5 which diffuses the fluid throughout the whole area of the diaper and retains it. Thus, the whole of the diaper is slightly moistened but does not cause any discom fort such as drippingly wet feeling. Flowing back of the fluid from the crust layer 5 to the surface layer 1 is prevented by the partition layer 3.
