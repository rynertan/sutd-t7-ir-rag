# OPTICAL SYSTEM FOR PROJECTION DISPLAY USING SPATIAL LIGHT MODULATOR 1111111

## Abstract
The projection display 100 of the present invention uses a light source 101 , an optical system 102 to 108, 110, 113 and 113 , a spatial light modulator 109 and a display screen 1410 . In the preferred embodiment, the spatial light mod ulator 109 is in the form of a deformable mirror device having a plurality of individual cells 1012 whose deforma tion may be individually controlled. A Schlierin optical system 106 enables projection on the display screen of images of the individual deformable mirror cells 1012 . The intensity of these screen images corresponds to the amount of deforma tion of the corresponding mirror cell. Color displays can be formed employing multiple deformable mirror devices 109, 117 and 122 with color filters 114, 118 and 123 . A three dimensional display can be formed by several methods which provide a slightly different display to the eyes of the observer. In the preferred embodiment, the deformable mirror device 109 includes a drive system 800 which automatically refreshs the individual deformable mirror cells thus reducing the need for data transmission to sustain the display. This drive requires data only for the sections of the display where alteration is desired.
