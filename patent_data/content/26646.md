# Graphite electrode column joints and pins for forming them.

## Abstract
In graphite electrode joints comprising two graphite electrode ends 10, 11 having axial tapered end sockets and a double ended tapered thread connecting pin 13 screwed into both of said sockets, the strength of the joint is improved by increasing the angle of the taper from the conventional 9.46 degrees to form 15 to 35 degrees inclusive.
