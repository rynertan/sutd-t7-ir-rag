## Description
Chickenpox is caused by varicella zoster virus VZV , a member of the herpesvirus group. The disease occurs in persons with no prior VZV immunity. VZV specific antibodies can be demonstrated shortly after onset of disease, decline during convalesence, but remain detectable for many years and correlate with immunity to the disease. Chickenpox is highly contagious over 90 of the population becomes exposed to VZV during the first two decades. The disease is highly morbid to the immunosuppressed and to those beyond the second decade. In most, if not all cases, VZV becomes latent in dorsal root ganglion cells. From this latent state, VZV can reactivate and cause zoster even in the presence of specific antibodies, probably as a result of weakened cellular immunity. VZV has six major glycoproteins on its surface gp105, gp92, gp83, gp62, gp57, gp55. These glycoproteins apparently are the products of three genes gA gp105 , gB gp62, gp57 and gC gp92, gp83, gp55 . The gC glycoproteins are the majority and most immunogenic VZV glycoproteins. Some monoclonal antibodies to gA and gB display complement independent neutralization, and monoclonal antibodies to gC display complement dependent neutralization. It is an object of the present invention to provide antigens which will prevent diseases associated with VZV infections. Another object is to provide antigens which can be used diagnostically to measure VZV antibody titers. Another object is to provide methods for the preparation of these antigens. Another object is to provide methods for using the antigens to raise antibodies, both The DNA sequence of the VZV gC gene has been identified. A fragment of the DNA has been cloned into a vector which, when placed in a host organism, expresses proteins which react with convalescent zoster sera and with neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to gC. These proteins are useful for preparation of a vaccine to VZV. The present invention is directed to a 0.9 Kbp DNA fragment whose nucleotide sequences and amino acid sequences have been located within the known sequence of the entire VZV genome, in the VZV DNA encoding the protective immunogenic glycoproteins gp92, gp83 and gp55. The present invention also is directed to vectors containing all or an antigenic part of this 0.9 Kbp DNA fragment. The invention also is directed to host cells which contain these vectors and which cells are capable of expressing all or an antigenic part of the peptides encoded by the 0.9 kbp fragment. RNAs are isolated from cells producing VZV. These RNAs are preselected by hybridization to the The DNA segment which encodes RNA translatable to gC polypeptides is identified precisely as follows. VZV DNA is randomly digested and 0.3 1.5 Kbp fragments are inserted into the pORF2 expression vector. Bacteria transformed by the recombinant plasmids are screened with monoclonal antibodies for the production of gC antigens. Plasmid DNA from The hybrid protein containing VZV gC sequences derived from the 0.9 Kbp DNA segment is characterized with respect to serological reactivity. It is found to react with 8 of 11 convalescent zoster sera tested as well as with 7 of 8 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to VZV gC. Therefore, this polypeptide segment carries neutralization epitopes as well as the majority of antigenicity associated with gC polypeptides. Examples of suitable hosts for expression of VZV proteins include prokaryotic organisms, such as These proteins are usefully individually or in combination when placed in a physiologically acceptable carrier, e.g., saline or phosphate buffered saline, to protect against VZV disease when administered to a member of a susceptible mammalian species in amount of approximately 10 to 500 µg per dose, preferably from approximately 50 to 250 µg per dose. One or more doses may be administered to produce effective protection against VZV disease. The protein may be administered by injection, e.g., subcutaneously or intramuscularly. It is also to be understood that these proteins can be directly expressed in humans by means of appropriate viral expression vectors such as adeno, vaccinia, or herpes simplex. The following examples illustrate the present invention without, however, limiting the same thereto. The disclosure of each reference mentioned in the following examples is hereby incorporated by reference.
