# Traversing motion for use with apparatus for winding continuous elongate elements.

## Abstract
In a traversing motion for winding operations a scroll cam is provided with a helical groove 6 for guiding a cam follower assembly 8 which then recipro cates to guide the winding operator. The cam follower assembly has two cam followers an elongate follower 1 and a non elongate follower 9 . Correspondingly, in its end regions, groove 6 is widened to allow passage of elongate follower 10 and, at least in the end regions, a further groove 23, 24 is provided for non elongate follower 9 . Allows acceleration with a sharper change of direction at the end points 17 for more uniform winding.
