## Description
NOVEL URETHANES, CURABLE COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THE NOVEL URETHANES,AND THE USE OF THE COMPOSITIONS IN ELECTRODE POSITION Background of the Invention Field of the Invention The present invention relates to novel urethanes and to the methods of making and using same. More particularly, the invention relates to curable compositions com prising active hydrogen containing materials and the novel ure thanes, and to the use of these compositions in electrodeposition. Brief Description of the Prior Art Curable compositions containing blocked isocyanate crosslinking agents are known in the art. some of the crosslinking agents aid in effecting cure of these compositions at relatively low temperatures of about 320 350 F. 160 177 C. over a period of 20 to 30 minutes. Yet, lower temperature cure is required for coated substrates which have plastic parts which tend to deform at the afore stated tempera tures. Hence, much work has been done to formulate compositions that cure effectively at relatively lower temperatures. As is the case here, much work has been done in develop ing blocked isocyanate crosslinking agents which would aid in effecting cure at lower temperatures. The work done has shown that proper selection of blocking agents for isocyanate groups is determinative in effecting cure at low temperatures. It is believed that blocked isocyanates that unblock readily at low temperatures effect cure of coatings at low temperatures, However, their use in coating compositions is limited in some respects. In one respect, coatings derived therefrom, although useful, may have poor solvent resistance, indicating a relatively low degree of cure. In another respect, the coatings, although more completely cured, may have poor appearance. In yet another respect, some of these coating compositions, particularly the water based compositions, are rather unstable. By the present invention, a select group of blocking agents which are superior to blocking agents of the prior art have been found effective in overcoming the afore stated limitations. Summary of the Invention In accordance with the foregoing, the present invention encompasses a urethane containing material having a moiety of the structure EMI3.1 Preferably, R is hydrogen, an alkyl, alkenyl or aryl group, and X is hydrogen, an alkyl, alkenyl or aryl group, or a moiety of the structure EMI3.2 Preferably, R1 and R2 are, each independently, hydrogen, an alkyl, alkenyl or aryl group. In this context, the urethanecontaining material is alternately referred to as novel urethane or blocked isocyanate . In a method of preparing the novel urethane, an isocyanate is reacted with a compound of the structure EMI3.3 wherein R and X are as described above. This compound is alternately 11 11 referred to herein as a novel blocking agent . A representative example of the above compound is a glycolamide such as ,N dibutylglycolamide. This can be reacted with an isocyanate such as 2,4 toluene diisocyanate to form the novel urethane. The novel urethanes can be used as curing agents in combination with active hydrogen containing materials to form curable compositions. The urethane can be present as a separate component or as an integral component of the active hydrogencontaining material. When the active hydrogen containing material contains an ionic group, the curable composition can be dispersed in aqueous medium and used in the process of electrodeposition. It has been found that the novel urethane is highly effective for low temperature curing of the curable compositions such as coating compositions.In particular, it has been found that the novel urethane is very suitable for low temperature curing of water based compositions such as electrodepositable compositions. Notably, these compositions are stable and at relatively low temperatures provide coatings of a high degree of cure, solvent resistance, good appearance, as well as other known desirable film properties. Detailed Description of the Invention The isocyanates which are useful in preparing the novel urethane can be monoisocyanates or polyisocyanates, or a mixture thereof the polyisocyanates are preferred. They can be aliphatic or aromatic isocyanates, with the aromatic isocyanates being preferred for lower temperature cure. Representative of the monoisocyanates are ethylenically unsaturated monoisocyanate monomers such as vinyl isocyanate, e.g., propenyl isocyanate, isopropenyl isocyanate, 9 decenyl isocyanate isocyanate acrylates, e.g., 2 isocyanato ethyl meth acrylate allyl isocyanates, e.g., beta allyloxyethyl isocyanate. These isocyanate monomers are typically reacted, i.e., blocked, with the novel blocking agent and then copolymerized with appropriate monomers under free radical polymerization conditions to form thermosetting compositions. Representative examples of the polyisocyanates are aliphatic isocyanates such as alkylene isocyanates, e.g., trimethylene, tetramethylene, pentamethylene, hexamethylene, 1,2propylene, 1,2 butylene, 2,3 butylene, 1,3 butylene, ethylene and butylidene diisocyanates and the cycloalkylene isocyanates, e.g., 1,3 cyclopentane, 1,4 cyclohexane, 1, 2 cyclohexane diisocyanates and isophorone diisocyanates.Representative examples of the polyisocyanates are aromatic isocyanates such as arylene isocyanates, e.g., m phenylene, p phenylene, 4,4 diphenyl, 1,5 naphthalene and 1,4 naphthalene diisocyanates and alkarylene isocyanates, e.g., 4,4 diphenylene methane, 2,4 or 2,6 tolylene, or mixtures thereof, 4,4 toluidine, and 1,4 xylylene diisocyanates nuclear substituted aromatic compounds, e.g., dianisidine diisocyanate, 4,4 diphenylether diisocyanate and chlorodiphenylene diisocyanate.Triisocyanates such as triphenyl methane 4,4 ,4 triisocyanate, 1,3,5triisocyanato benzene and 2,4,6 triisocyanato toluene and the tetraisocyanates such as 4,4 diphenyldimethyl methane 2,2 ,5, 5 tetraisocyanate and polymerized polyisocyanates such as tolylene diisocyanate dimers and trimers and the like can also be used herein. In addition, the polyisocyanates may be prepolymers derived from polyols such as polyether polyols or polyester polyols, including polyols which are reacted with excess polyisocyanates, such as mentioned above, to form isocyanate terminated prepolymers.Examples of the suitable isocyanate prepolymers are described inU.S. Patent 3,799,854, column 2, lines 22 to 53, which is herein incorporated by reference.

X can be the moiety of the structure EMI6.1 R1 and R2, each independently, can be hydrogen or a hydrocarbyl or substituted hydrocarbyl group, a saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbyl group such as an alkyl, alkenyl or aryl group. Examples of the alkyl groups are those containing from about 1 to 26, preferably from about 2 to 18, and more preferably from about 4 to 8 carbon atoms. Specific examples of the alkyl groups are ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, cyclohexyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, dodecyl and stearyl groups. Examples of the alkenyl groups are those containing from about 2 to 26, preferably from 2 to 18, and more preferably from about 4 to 8 carbon atoms.

R1 and R2 can be members of a cyclic or heterocyclic group such as morpholine, piperidine or .the like. Compounds possessing substantially the same properties as the unsubstituted hydrocarbyl groups exemplified above are equivalents thereof and are those wherein the hydrocarbyl group can bear one or two or more substituents. The substituents are such as would not adversely affect the reaction described herein or the utility of the invention. Non limiting examples of the substituents are halo, e.g., fluoro and bromo nitro sulfato alkoxy, e.g., methoxy, ethoxy alkyl or alkenyl as in aralkyl or aralkenyl , e.g., methyl, ethyl, butyl, propenyl, butenyl and the like. Specific examples of the afore described compounds are hydroxyacetaldehyde, acetol, l hydroxy 2 butanone,o hydroxyaceto phenone, N, N dipentylglycolamid e, N,N dipropylglycolamide, N, Ndibutyllactamide, Nmethyllactamide, morpholine glycolamide, lactanilide, N,N diethyllactamide, N methyl N butyllactamide andN octylglycolamide. Of these compounds, N,N dibutylglycolamide is particularly preferred. As a matter of convenience, there is provided hereinbelow a suitable method of preparing the preferred glycolamides and glycollactamides. They can be prepared by reacting a corresponding acid such as glycolic or lactic acid or the ester thereof with an amine such as dibutylamine . The amine is added to the acid or ester in a properly equipped reaction vessel at temperatures of about 70 170 C. Upon reaction, there is produced a water of reaction or alcohol which can be removed by distillation. The resultant mixture may be vacuum stripped to remove the azeotropic solvent used therein and excess amine and or unreacted acid or ester. In preparing the novel urethane, the above compound and the isocyanate are admixed under anhydrous or substantially anhydrous conditions and generally in an inert atmosphere such as under a nitrogen blanket. The equivalent ratio of the NCO of the isocyanate to the OH of the above compound can be from about 0.1 to 1.2 1. Depending on the reagents employed, the starting materials may be added simultaneously to the reaction vessel, or they may be added slowly, one to the other, at elevated temperatures.After all the ingredients have been added, the mixture is reacted with stirring at a temperature and for a period of time which depends, among others, on the isocyanate, until all, or virtually all of the isocyanate is reacted. For aromatic diisocyanates, the reaction is carried out at about 25 to 100 C for about 1 to 8 hours, preferably, 35 to 800C. for 1.5 to 5 hours. For aliphatic diisocyanates, the reaction proceeds at about 50 to 1000C. for about 3 to 10 hours, preferably 80 100 C. for 5 to 7 hours. The degree of conversion of the reactants to the urethanes can be determined by infrared spectroscopy. It may, in some instances, be necessary to employ other reactants such as alcohols to consume unreacted isocyanates remaining in the resultant mixture. A catalyst is usually employed in preparing the novel urethane. Catalysts useful herein are those suitable for urethane formation. Preferably, metals, metal salts or complexes, for example, lead acetate, dibutyltin dilaurate, stannous octoate and the like are employed. A solvent is usually employed in preparing the novel urethane. Solvents that are non reactive with isocyanates are preferred, e.g., ketones, e.g., methyl isobutyl ketone, ethers such as diethyl ether of ethylene glycols, or esters such as ethyl acetate, and other solvents such as dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide or N methyl 2 pyrrolidone. While the above method of preparing the novel urethane is described herein with particularity, other methods of preparation can be employed. Thus, compounds or compositions obtained by other methods, having structural formula and properties as the novel urethane described herein, are encompassed by this invention. In the practice of the invention, the novel urethane is useful in combination with active hydrogen containing materials to form curable compositions such as coating compositions. In the preferred low temperature cure embodiments of the invention, the novel urethane is employed with cure catalysts which are more fully defined herein. The active hydrogen group can be hydroxy, primary or secondary amino or thio group. Non limiting examples of the active hydrogen containing materials are hydroxyl group containing polymers, e.g., polymeric polyols, such as alkyd polymers, polyester polymers, hydroxyl group containing acrylic polymers, hydroxyl group containing polyurethane polymers, hydroxyl group containing polyurea polymers, hydroxyl group containing polyether polymers, hydroxyl group containing epoxy polymers and hydroxyl groupcontaining polymers which are polyepoxide amine adducts.The epoxy polymers can be epoxy free or epoxy containing. The molecular weights of the polymeric polyols can vary over a wide range depending upon their type and on whether the curable composition is organic solvent based or water based and also on the desired performance characteristics of the coating.Polyester, epoxy and alkyd polymers can have molecular weights as low as about 500 and as high as about 50,000, preferably the molecular weights are usually in the range of about 1,000 to 5,000 the molecular weights being on a number average basis relative to polystyrene, as determined by gel permeation chromatography.Acrylic polymers prepared by solution polymerization can have molecular weights of about 100,000 or higher, and usually in the range of about 5,000 to 50,000 on a number average basis relative to polystyrene, as can be determined by gel permeation chromatography. For acrylic latices, the molecular weight can range from 100,000 to several millions. The hydroxyl content of the polymeric polyol should be sufficient such that when the polyol is in combination with the curing agent, the composition will cure to a solvent resistant coating. Generally, the hydroxyl number of the polymeric polyol will be at least about 50 and preferably will be in the range of about 100 to 300, based on resin solids. A preferred class of polymeric polyols are hydroxyl group containing epoxy polymers. A particularly preferred class of polymeric polyols are the polyepoxide amine adducts. The epoxy polymers which can be used in the practice of the invention are polyepoxides, that is, polymers having a 1,2 epoxy equivalency greater than 1, preferably about 2 or more. Preferred are polyepoxides which are difunctional with regard to epoxy. The preferred polyepoxides are polyglycidyl ethers of cyclic polyols. Particularly preferred are polyglycidyl ethers of polyphenols such as bisphenol A. Examples of polyepoxides are given in U.S. Patent 4,260,716, column 3, line 20, to column 4, line 30, the portions of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Besides the epoxy polymers disclosed above, other epoxycontaining polymers which can be used are acrylic polymers which contain epoxy groups These polymers are formed by polymerizing an unsaturated epoxy group containing monomer such as glycidyl acrylate or methacrylate with one or more other polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomers. Examples of these polymers are described in U.S. Patent 4,001,156, column 3, line 59, to column 5, line 60, the portions of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Examples of amines which can be used in preparing the polyepoxide amine adduct are ammonia, primary, secondary and tertiary amines and mixtures thereof. The reaction product of the polyepoxide and the amine can be at least partially neutralized with an acid to form a polymeric product containing amine salt and or quaternary ammonium salt groups. Reaction conditions of polyepoxides with amines, examples of various amines and at least partial neutralization with acid are disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,260,720, column 5, line 20, to column 7, line 4, the portions of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Also, various polyepoxide amine adducts are described inEuropean Patent Application 0012463. With regard to the amount of organic amine and polyepoxide which are reacted with one another, the relative amounts depend upon the extent of cationic base such as cationic salt group formation desired and this in turn will depend upon the molecular weight of the polymer. The extent of cationic salt group formation and the molecular weight of the reaction product should be selected such that when the resultant cationic polymer is mixed with aqueous medium, a stable dispersion will form. A stable dispersion is one which does not settle or is one which is easily dispersible if some sedimentation occurs. In some embodiments, the dispersion should additionally be of sufficient cationic character that the dispersed polymer particles will migrate towards the cathode when an electrical potential is impressed between an anode and a cathode immersed in aqueous dispersion. Also, the molecular weight, structure and extent of cationic salt group formation should be controlled such that the dispersed polymer will have the required flow to form a film on the substrate in the case of electrodeposition, to form a film on the cathode. The film should be insensitive to moisture to the extent that it will not redissolve in the electrodeposition bath or be rinsed away from the coated surface after removal from the bath. In general, most of the cationic polymers useful in the practice of the invention will have average molecular weights within the range of about 500 100,000 and contain from about 0.01 to 10, preferably about 0.1 to 5.0, preferably from about 0.3 to 3.0 milliequivalents of basic group, e.g., cationic group, per gram of resin solids. Obviously one must use the skill in the art to couple the molecular weight with the cationic group content to arrive at a satisfactory polymer. The polyglycidyl ethers will have molecular weights of about 500 to 10,000, preferably 1,000 to 5,000. Acrylic polymers, on the other hand, will have molecular weights as high as 100,000, preferably 5,000 to 50,000. Besides the cationic polymers, anionic polymers which are designed to form aqueous based coating compositions may be used in coating applications such as electrodeposition. It should also be appreciated that organic solvent based coating compositions employing the above polymers without ionic salt groups can also be used.Formulating coating compositions with such polymers is well known in the art and need not be described in any further detail. The novel urethane can be a separate or integral component to the active hydrogen containing material. For example, a polyisocyanate can be fully blocked with the novel blocking agent and be present as a separate component with the active hydrogencontaining material. Alternately, a polyisocyanate can be partially blocked with the novel blocking agent and reacted with the active hydrogen containing material to form an ungelled onecomponent material. In the latter case, the resultant urethane is integral with the active hydrogen containing material rather than being present as a separate component. Procedures for preparing integral blocked isocyanate curing agents are shown in U.S.Patent 3, 947, 338. Whether present as a separate component or integral with the active hydrogen containing material, the novel urethane is present in an amount sufficient to impart excellent cure to the curable composition. Typically, the urethane is present in an equivalent ratio of 0.1 1 and preferably 0.3 to 1 1 of the urethane to the active hydrogen containing material of the curable composition. The novel urethane is usually employed in combination with a cure catalyst. Typically, the cure catalyst is a metal salt and or complex of a metal such as lead, zinc, iron, tin and manganese. Suitable salts of these metals are, for example, octoates and naphthanates. A suitable complex is, for example, acetyl acetonate. The cure catalyst is used in amounts sufficient to effect cure at the relatively low temperatures described herein.For example, the metal salt and or complex is employed as a cure catalyst in amounts of about 0.1 to 2.0, preferably 0.2 to 1 percent metal by weight solids based on the weight of the curable composition. The cure catalyst can be mixed simultaneously with other starting materials for the preparation of the coating composition, or introduced into the coating composition in any order that is convenient. In the practice of the invention, the curable compositions can be used as coating, laminating or molding compositions.Preferably, they can be used as water based or solvent based coating compositions. The components of the coating composition can be mixed simultaneously or in any order that is convenient. If the components are a liquid and of sufficiently low viscosity, they can be mixed together neat to form the coating composition.Alternately, if the components are higher viscosity liquids or solids, the components can be mixed with a diluent to reduce the viscosity of the composition so that it may be suitable for coating applications. By liquid diluent is meant a solvent or a non solvent which is volatile and which is removed after the coating is applied and is needed to reduce viscosity sufficiently to enable forces available in simple coating techniques, that is, brushing and spraying, to spread the coating to controllable, desired and uniform thickness. Also, diluents assist in substrate wetting, resinous component compatibility and coalescence or film formation.Generally, when used, the diluent will be present in the composition in amounts of about 20 to 90, preferably 50 to 80 percent by weight based on total weight of the coating composition, although more diluent may be employed depending upon the particular coating application. Examples of suitable liquid diluents for organic solventbased coatings will depend somewhat on the particular system employed. In general, however, aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene and xylene, ketones such as methyl ethyl ketone and methyl isobutyl ketone, alcohols such as isopropyl alcohol, normal butyl alcohol, monoalkyl ethers of glycols such as 2 alkoxyethanol, 2 alkoxypropanol and compatible mixtures of these solvents can be used. Besides organic solvents, water can be used as a diluent either alone or in combination with water miscible organic solvents.When water is used, the coating composition is usually modified such as by incorporating water solubilizing groups such as the cationic groups mentioned above to provide for the necessary solubility in water. Besides the cationic groups mentioned above, other water solubilizing groups such as non ionic groups, for example, ethylene oxide groups, and anionic groups such as carboxylate salt groups may be introduced into the polymer to disperse or solubilize the coating composition in water. The coating compositions of the invention may also optionally contain a pigment. Pigments may be of any conventional type, comprising, for example, iron oxides, lead oxides, strontium chromate, carbon black, coal dust, titanium dioxide, talc, barium sulfate, as well as color pigments such as cadmium yellow, cadmium red, chromium yellow and metallic pigments such as aluminum flake. The pigment content of the coating composition is usually expressed as the pigment to resin weight ratio. In the practice of the present invention, pigment to resin weight ratios can be 2 1 or higher, and for most pigmented coatings, are usually within the range of about 0.05 to 1 1. In addition to the above ingredients, various fillers, plasticizers, anti oxidants, ultraviolet light absorbers, flow control agents, surfactants and other formulating additives can be employed if desired. These materials are optional and generally constitute up to 30 percent by weight of the coating composition based on total solids. The coating compositions of the invention can be applied by conventional methods, e.g., non electrophoretic methods including brushing, dipping, flow coating and spraying. Usually, they can be applied virtually over any substrate including wood, metal, glass, cloth, leather, plastic, foam and the like, as well as over various primers. For electroconductive substrates such as metals, the coatings can be applied by electrodeposition. In general, the coating thickness will vary somewhat depending upon the application desired. In general, coatings from about 0.1 to 10 mils can be applied and coatings from about 0.1 to 5 mils are usual. When aqueous dispersions of the coating composition are employed for use in electrodeposition, the aqueous dispersion is placed in contact with an electrically conductive anode and an electrically conductive cathode. The surface to be coated can be made the cathode or the anode. In the case of cationic electrodeposition, which is preferred herein, the surface to be coated is the cathode. Following contact with the aqueous dispersion, an adherent film of the coating composition is deposited on the electrode being coated when a sufficient voltage is impressed between the electrodes. Conditions under which electrodeposition is carried out are known in the art. The applied voltage may be varied and can be, for example, as low as one volt or as high as several thousand volts, but is typically between 50 and 500 volts.Current density is usually between 1.0 ampere and 15 amperes per square foot and tends to decrease during electrodeposition indicating the formation of an insulating film. After the coating has been applied, it is cured by heating at elevated temperatures for a period of time sufficient to form solvent resistant coatings. By solvent resistant coatings is meant that the coating will be resistant to acetone, for example, by rubbing across the coating with an acetone saturated cloth.Coatings which are not cured or poorly cured will not withstand the rubbing action with acetone and will be removed with less than 10 acetone double rubs. Cured coatings, on the other hand, will withstand a minimum of 20 acetone double rubs, and preferably 100 acetone double rubs. It has been found that substrates coated with compositions employing the novel urethanes can cure at relatively lower temperatures. In certain embodiments of the invention, it has been found that the urethanes impart excellent cure at temperatures as low as 121 C. 250 F. . It is a feature of this invention that in comparison with conventional curing agents, particularly those which comprise blocked isocyanate curing agents, the urethanes impart a higher degree of cure at ordinary cure temperatures and at relatively lower temperatures. It is a distinct feature of the invention that the novel urethanes are stable in coating compositions, particularly water based coating compositions, and provide low temperature cure as described herein. These and other aspects of the invention are illustrated more specifically by the following non limiting examples. Example 1 This example illustrates the preparation of N,N dibutylglycolamide. The following were used in the preparation Ingredients Parts by Weight grams Glycolic acid 70 technical grade 3091.5 N,N dibutylamine reagent grade 3538.1 Toluene 356.6 To luene 213.8 At room temperature, a properly equipped reaction vessel was charged with the glycolic acid, followed by addition of the N, N dibutyl amine through a dropping funnel at a rate slow enough to prevent boiling of the reaction mixture in the flask. The reaction temperature was kept preferably below 70 C. so as to avoid loss of the amine.After the addition, the reaction mixture was heated to reflux at 11OC., held for one hour at reflux, cooled to 950C., and then the first portion of toluene was added thereto. Thereafter, the reaction vessel was fitted with a Dean Stark trap containing toluene and then heated to 1030C. to remove water from the mixture. The removal of water through the trap was continued until the temperature reached 170 C. Upon cooling to 1054C., the second portion of toluene was added.The mixture was again refluxed and water removed therefrom until the temperature reached 185 C. The resultant mixture was then vacuum stripped to remove toluene and excess amine using a 23 inch of mercury vacuum and a maximum temperature of 157 C. The resultant composition comprising N,Ndibutylglycolamide had a milliequivalent of acid per gram equal to 0.093, milliequivalent of amine per gram equal to 0.07 and percent of water equal to 0.040. Example 2 This example illustrates the novel urethane and the method of preparing same, using the above N,N dibutylglycolamide and an isocyanate. The preparation was as follows Ingredients Parts by Weight grams MONDUR TD 801 522.0Methyl isobutyl ketone 469.4 Tr imethyl olpropane 134.0Dibutyltin dilaurate 2 dropsDibutylglycolamide of Example 1 494 2 Butoxyethanol 42.3Butanol 52.5 1An 80 20 mixture of 2,4 and 2,6 toluene diisocyanate, available from Mobay Chemical Company. A solution of the diisocyanate and methyl isobutyl ketone was charged to a properly equipped reaction vessel at room temperature followed by addition of the trimethylolpropane in 3 equal portions with the reaction temperature being kept at about 40 C.
