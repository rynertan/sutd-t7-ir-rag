# Production of reaction bonded silicon carbide bodies.

## Abstract
Reaction bonded silicon carbide artefacts are produced by siliconising a green body formed from a coherent mixture of silicone carbide and carbon powders. The surface of the green body is coated with a paste comprising silicon powder suspended in a carbonisable viscous medium which, on heating of the coating, is converted to an open cellular carbon structure and then, on siliconising the green body, to a silicon carbide skeleton through which molten silicon is drawn.
