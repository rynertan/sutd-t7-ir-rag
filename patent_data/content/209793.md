# Cracking catalyst.

## Abstract
Catalytic cracking catalyst compositions having a high degree of activity and selectivity for the production of high octane gasoline fractions which comprise stabilized crystal line molecular sieve SAPO 37 dispersed in an inorganic oxide matrix. The crystalline structure and activity of the SAPO 37 molecular sieve component is preserved by including a stabi lizing amount of the organic template compound used in the manufacture of the molecular sieve within the pore structure thereof until such time as the catalyst is thermally activated during use.
