# Data processing system having dual processors.

## Abstract
The data processing system comprises a host processor 101 and an attached processor 106 . Each processor is cap able of executing user programs under a different operating system and each processor is capable of accessing a system memory 103 but the host processor controls and performs all input and output operations for both processors. The sys tem memory 103 is shared by the processors therefore only one processor is active on the bus system at any given time. Control logic is disclosed for holding the host processor 101 and starting the attached processor 106 upon a command from the host and for holding the attached processor and starting the host in the event of interrupt conditions, attemp ted access by the attached processor to protected areas of memory, or execution of an out instruction by the attached processor. Memory mapping logic 102 is under host control, but provides mapping for both the host and attached proces sors.
