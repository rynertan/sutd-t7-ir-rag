# FLUID PRESSURE SENSOR WITH TEMPERATURE INDICATOR

## Abstract
A pressure sensor 33 is provided by a bridge circuit on a semiconductor diaphragm 44 , with diaphragm deflection be ing effective to produce an output voltage proportional to the deflecting force. A constant current source 62 is coupled to the energizing terminals of the bridge circuit. By measuring the voltage drop across the semiconductor bridge during opera tion, an output signal indicative of bridge temperature is ob tained. Accordingly two output signals, pressure 32 and tem perature 35 , are derived from a single bridge sensor 33 . This produces a compact, accurate transducer assembly for use in an automotive control system, providing two control signals from a single sensor structure.
