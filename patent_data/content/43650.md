# Method and adsorbant composition for 82 Rb generation.

## Abstract
The present invention provides a composition com prising Sr and an adsorbant selected from tin oxide, hydrated tin oxide, polyantimonic acid, titanium oxide, hydrated titanium oxide, ferric oxide and hydrated fer ric oxide, and also provides a low ⁸²Sr breakthrough method of generating ⁸²Rb which comprises outing such ⁸²Sr charged adsorbant.
