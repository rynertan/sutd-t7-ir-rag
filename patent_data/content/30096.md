## Description
Detergent ComDosition THE PRESENT INVENTION relates to a detergent composition, in particular to an anhydrous non ionic detergent composition containing builders. Heavy duty detergent compositions for use, for example, in domestic washing machines are commonly sold in the form of powders. The advantage of a powder is that it enables a wide range of inorganic builders to be incorporated into the composition, wider than if an aqueous composition were formulated because some builders e.g. sodium tripolyphosphate are unstable in the presence of water and bleaches e.g. sodium perborate or percarbonate may oxidise organic components of the composition in the presence of water. It is also impossible to formulate a homogeneous liquid aqueous composition with organic surfactant and the desired quantity of inorganic builders. The disadvantage of a powder from the manufacturer s point of view is that it is relatively expensive to make.Compared with an equivalent aqueous composition a powder requires more expensive drying equipment for its production, and as well as being expensive such equipment is often difficult and sometimes hazardous to operate. In our Belgian Patent No 867 827 we have disclosed heavy duty detergent compositions which contain builders dispersed in substantially water free non ionic liquid surfactants with the aid of dispersants, silica dispersants being employed. Surprisingly we have now found that provided that the dispersed solids have average particle diameters of less than 10 microns, dispersions in substantially water free non ionic liquid surfactants having pour points less than 100C are acceptably stable even in the absence of a dispersant for the builder. Thus it is possible to prepare formulations containing only components required for the washing function of the composition without introducing additional materials required only for stabilising the dispersed condition of the detergent composition itself. According to the invention a liquid detergent composition comprises a dispersion of solids comprising at least one builder which is preferably sodium or potassium tripolyphosphate and at least one bleach which is preferably sodium or potassium perborate or percarbonate, the average particle diameter of the solids being at most 10 microns and preferably at most 5 micron in a substantially water free non ionic liquid surfactant which has a pour point of less than iO0C, the composition being free from dispersants for the solids.In particular, the composition is free from silica containing dispersants. The pour point may be measured by ASTM test method designation D97 66 reapproved in 1971. Any builder which is known for use in detergent compositions may be used in the composition according to the present invention. Generally such builders are inorganic in nature but some organic products in particular sodium carboxymethylcellulose may be used.Suitable inorganic builders include phosphates, e.g.trisodium phosphate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate, sodium hexametaphosphate and, preferably, sodium tripolyphosphate, carbonates e.g. sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate and sodium sesquicarbonate, clays e.g.kaolin, montmorillonites and sodium bentonite, and miscellaneous salts e.g. sodium meta silicate and sodium citrate and nitrilotriacetic acid. The potassium analogues of these sodium compounds may also be used. In order to provide an effective dispersion of the solids in the liquid non ionic surfactant it is desirable that at least 90 of the particles of the solid have particle sizes less than 10 microns in diameter. The non ionic surfactant which is a component of the composition according to the invention is preferably an alkylene oxide derivative. In particular, the non ionic surfactant may be an alkylene oxide derivative of an amide, alkyl Phenol or an alkanol. The alkyl group in the alkyl phenol may be straight chain or branched chain and may contain from 6 to 20 carbon atoms, e.g. para nonyl phenol or para dodecylphenol.The alkanol may contain 6 to 20 carbon atoms, particularly 10 to 16 carbon atoms. The alcohol is preferably a primary or secondary alkanol having a linear or mono brached alkyl group. The composition may usefully comprise two nonionic surfactants, one of which fulfills a surfactant function and the other of which both fulfills a surfactant function and reduces the pour point of the composition. The former surfactant may for example comprise alcohols having 12 to 16 carbon atoms which have been alkoxylated with 5 to 15 moles of ethylene and or propylene oxide the other surfactant may be a linear or branched chain C6 11 alcohol alkoxylate which comprises 2 to 8 moles of ethylene and or propylene oxide per mole, branched chain alcohols being preferred in the C811 range and linear alcohols being preferred in the C68 range, or an alkyl phenol alkoxylate having 2 to 6 moles of ethylene and or propylene oxide per molecule the alkyl group suitably being in a para position and having 6 to 12 carbon atoms. A further surfactant of the anionic or cationic type may be included if desired. Such anionic or cationic surfactants may be of known type for example the anionic detergents may be soaps, alkylbenzene or olefine sulphonates, alcohol sulphates or alcohol alkoxylate sulphates the cationic surfactants are suitably di C14 20 and preferably di C16 alkyl, di lower alkyl ammonium salts or hydroxides for example chlorides or sulphates. The loweralkyl groups are suitably methyl groups. In general the alkyl phenol or alkanol derivative may comprise 2 to 20 alkylene oxide units which are preferably ethylene oxide units although a minor number of propylene oxide or a lesser number of butylene oxide units may also be present. The amide is suitably a mono or di alkanol amide e.g. a mono or diethanolamide preferably of a C6 to C30 more preferablyC10 to C20 alkanoic acid, e.g. coconut acids, tallow acids or stearic acid. An alternative non ionic surfactant for use in a composition according to the invention comprises a copolymer of ethylene oxide with propylene oxide and or butylene oxide. The copolymer comprises a block of propylene and or butylene oxide units on to which is grafted the ethylene oxide. The block preferably comprises 20 to 40 propylene oxide units, especially about 30 such units and 20 to 30 especially about 26 ethylene oxide units. It is a feature of the composition according to the invention that the dispersion of the solids in the non ionic surfactant is particularly stable. If the solids do separate at all then the resulting phase is loosely flocculated and is readily redispersible while if the relative amounts of the solids and non ionic surfactant in the composition is correctly chosen there is little phase separation as the liquid. fills the space between the loosely packed solid particles. The composition may contain 20 to 70 by weight builder s . It is preferred that the composition contain 30 to 60 and more preferably 40 to 60 by weight builder s . The composition preferably contains 1 to 20 and more preferably 2 to 15 by weight of bleach. The remainder is preferably substantially non ionic surfactant. The composition may also contain additives conventionally found in detergent compositions e.g. optical brighteners, ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid, dyes, perfumes or enzymes.The invention will now be further described with reference to the following Example EXAMPLE A heavy duty laundry liquid was produced as follows Sodium tripolyphosphate 40g , sodium percarbonate 5g and miscellaneous ingredients colour, perfume, optical brighteners, carboxymethylcellulose and anticorrosion agents 5g and polyethylene glycol molecular weight 200, 5g were added to a non ionic surfactant mixture 45g comprising Synperonic K 87, a C13 to C15 primary alcohol alkoxylated to an average of 7 moles of alkylene oxide per mole of alcohol the alkylene oxide being a mixture of 8 propylene oxide and 92 ethylene oxide 36.6g and Alphanol 6 a C7 to C9 primary alcohol, average molecular weight 126 ethoxylated with six moles per mole of ethylene oxide 8.4g The whole of the ingredients were mixed by hand to form a stiff paste which was then mixed in aSilverson mixer and then a Dyno Mill bead mill to reduce the mean diameter of the particles to about 2.5 microns.The product was a suspension stable for at least three months, at the end of which there was slight settling readily reversible by shaking. The mixture had a pour point of 70C. The product was tested by measuring the change in reflectance of a standard soiled Krefeld cloth using a Gardner reflectometer, brought about by washing the cloth in a Terg O Tometer manufactured by the US TestingCompany, at 100 rpm for 10 minutes followed by hand rinsing.
