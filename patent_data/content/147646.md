# Continuously variable vehicular transmission.

## Abstract
A continuously variable transmission for vehicular use including a torque converter 2 , a continuously variable transmission mechanism CVT, 5 , and a rotation transmis sion mechanism 4 of a variable ratio having at least reverse and forward low speed ranges of large reduction ratios and a forward high speed range of small reduction ratio and which is equipped with a planetary gear mechanism 40 . A torque transmission passage from the output shaft 24 of the torque converter to the output shaft 7 of the vehicular continuously variable transmission is divided into two torque transmission passages through the CVT 5 and to the rotation transmission mechanism 4 of variable ratio, so that in at least one of the speed ranges of large reduction ratios, the torque transmission passage through the CVT 5 is disconnected from the output shaft 7 of the vehicular continuously variable transmission so as to not apply a large torque to the CVT 5 in that case, whereas, in the speed range of small reduction ratio, the torque through the CVT and the torque through the rotation transmission mechan ism 4 of variable ratio are applied to the output shaft 7 of the vehicular continuously variable transmission. According ly, the torque borne by the CVT 5 is reduced so that it does not exceed the engine torque.
