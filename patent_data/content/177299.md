# APPARATUS FOR MAKING PHOTOVOLTAIC MODULES

## Abstract
An apparatus for making a photovoltaic module having a plurality of cell strips. The apparatus 10 includes a frame 11 and a support drum 25 rotatably received in the frame 11 . The support drum 25 has a substantially curved surface 42 having a plurality of paired dowel guides 45 for registering cell strips 50 relative to the surface 42 and an interconnect mesh 36 relative to the cell strip 50 . A plurality of paired complimentary clamp sets 51, 52 receive and secure the cell strips 50 and the interconnect mesh 36 to the support drum 25 .
