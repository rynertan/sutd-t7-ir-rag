# Synchronised gearbox.

## Abstract
A longitudinally engine shaft 312 is coupled to a transverse hollow shaft 319 on a first shaft line I . The hollow shaft 319 is connected through a creep gear 306 and an epicyclic range gear 305 to another transverse shaft 316 extending tnrough the hollow shaft 319 to the input side of a change speed gear 307 having a hollow output shaft 361 on a second transverse shaft line II . The hollow shaft 361 is connected to two half shafts 31 by a split differential 308, 309 with some wheels 371, 373 coupled by a shaft 375 extending through the hollow output shaft 361 . A control device 310 receives input signals 365 from sensors detecting the speeds or the change speed gear input and output shafts 317, 361 respectvely. The control device ensures synchcronisation when changing up or changing down by emitting control pulses. When changing down, the control pulses cause the engine governor to speed up the input shaft 317 . When changing up, the control pulses act on a brake 327 or a reverse clutch 325 in the range gear 305 so as to slow down the shaft 317 to the correct speed.
