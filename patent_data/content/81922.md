# Josephson junction device.

## Abstract
The invention provides a Josephson junction device having substantial voltage amplification. The junction Jâ‚ƒ is connected between a current summing node 31 and ground. An input terminal 23 is connected to the node 31 through an input resistor R The resistors 25 and 29 are enclosed within the cryogenic enclosure indicated by the dashed outline 38 , and therefore the amplification at the output resistor is virtually noise free. In a modification, the normally open switch 14 may be replaced by a voltage comparator device.
