## Description
Improvements in crop spraying apparatusAs is widely known, crop spraying machinery, equipment or apparatus is utilised in the treatment of crops by application of liquid pesticides, fungicides and weedkillers the apparatus providing the means by which to transform such liquids into a fine mist or spray, and or to throw them at or over the crop from a given distance.Such apparatus is therefore capable of covering a given area with a fine mist or a spray produced by generating pressure and imparting it to the liquid, or by pneumatic means of the kind producing an aerosol or air convection effect indeed such systems are commonly dubbed cropspraying , nebulising , aerosol and so forth, depending on the particular technique employed in forming and administering the fine mist, or droplets produced.Without delving into the various types of equipment or apparatus available, such as fixed, semi portable, handheld, pack carried on the shoulders military fashion litter between two operatives , low pressure, and so on, it can be stated in basic terms that all available types of apparatus consist of a tank containing whatever liquid is to be administered, a pump, and the spraying element itself taking the form of nozzles or impellers of varying designs.One of the many kinds of crop spraying apparatus which can be obtained is that utilising swinging, or alternating jets, which throw the liquid from one or more nozzles invested with alternating movement, such as to cover a basically rectangular area in relatively little time.In practical application, this type of design has not thus far been able to claim perfectly uniform distribution of the liquid administered which in certain cases is a factor of relatively little importance, but which in others, weed killer in particular, is especially desirable.An additional drawback is that flexible hoses commonly utilised will make unwarranted contact one with the other thus giving negative results. Also, apparatus purchased or designed for a given application cannot always be used for spraying a tight or narrow strip of land.One object of the invention described herein is that of improving on crop spraying apparatus of the type incorporating swinging nozzles, so as to obtain a uniform distribution, to all intents and purposes.A further object of the invention is that of arranging the apparatus so as to avoid contact between flexible hoses.Yet another object of the invention is that of making crop spraying feasible on tight, or narrow strips of land.All these objects are realised by the crop spraying apparatus to which the invention relates, which delivers at least one main jet from a nozzle invested with alternating motion and designed to cover a wide arc of land, and is characterised in that it delivers at least one supplementary auxiliary jet from a nozzle invested with alternating motion by swinging about a vertical axis and designed to cover a more central and tighter arc of land than that covered by said main jet.The invention will now be described, by way of example, with the aid of accompanying drawings, in which fig 1 is a vertical elevation of the apparatus, with certain parts cut away fig 2 is a schematic of the mechanism which imparts alternating movement to the nozzles, seen in plan fig 3 shows the auxiliary nozzle in plan, and in the preferred embodiment as set forth herein fig 4 shows the entire apparatus fitted up to a tractor together with a tank by means of which to carry the liquid to be sprayed. With reference to the drawings, 1 denotes a flexible hose through which liquid flowing from the tank passes to a manifold 2.3, 4 5 are cocks controlling the flow of liquid into flexible hoses 6, 7 8.9, 10 11 are rigid pipes at whose bottom ends three spray nozzles are fitted main nozzles 12 and 13, and auxiliary nozzle 14 each of said pipes capable of turning about its own axis in either direction.15 and 16 are gears turning as one with said pipes 9 and 10, whilst 16 denotes a lever drive disc turning as one with pipe 11.17 denotes the means of propulsion for the mechanism asIllustrated in fig 2, which in the preferred embodiment of the invention, is a gearmotor driven by electrical power supplied from the tractor battery.A further gear 18 mounted to the output shaft of said means of propulsion 1.7, is connected to one end of a rod 19 whose remaining end connects with a gear denoted 20 see fig 2 said ends of rod 19 both being hinged idle via pins 28 and 29.20 denotes a gear meshing with gear 18 aforesaid and connected with said lever drive disc 16 by way of a further rod 21 hinged idle via pins 30 and 31 at either end and disposed eccentrically, crank fashion, in the same way as rod 19. 14 denotes the apparatus secondary, auxiliary nozzle which in the preferred embodiment is branched into two outlets 23 and 24, disposed symmetrically and in the horizontal, as can be seen in fig 3.25 denotes the mounting bracket which carries the entire unit, fitted with top and bottom covers 26 and 26 of conventional design and fit.27 is a stay made fast at the one end to bracket 25, and at the remaining end to manifold 2 which it duly supports and obliges to lie at a given height such as will constrain flexible tubes 6, 7 8 to drop vertical and remain thus parallel one with the other.It will be observed that branches 23 and 24 of the auxiliary nozzle move within a horizontal plane lying below that within which movement of the lower 13 of the two main nozzles is brought about.Transmission of movement to the single nozzles is such that, whilst gear 18 mounted to output shaft 17 will continue rotating in the one direction, gear 20 is caused to alternate back and forth by virtue of the rod and crank arrangement incorporating rod 19 and its two off centred end hinge pins 28 and 29.At the same time, gear 18 also meshes with gear 20 and thus imparts alternate back and forth motion by way of rod 21 and pins 30 and 31 to the lever of drive disc 16 vwfthus causing pipe 11 to alternate therewith as one, and set up the desired degree of swing at nozzle 14. The combination of ratios built in to the mechanism thus composed is such, that nozzles 12 and 13 will swing back and forth in alternation between points approximately 1850 apart and located symmetrically with respect to centre, whilst nozzle 14 will swing likewise symmetrically with respect to centre, but in this instance between points approximately 600 to 800 apart. A variation on the embodiment thus described would be that of having a single nozzle 14 in place of the more desirable branched nozzle 23 and 24 illustrated, in which case the outlet would be centrally disposed. The function of crop spraying apparatus as described above is as follows with means of propulsion 17 set in motion, gear 18 will turn as one with the output shaft of same, revolving in one direction only, and continuously. Motion is passed on via rod 19 and its two idle hinge pins to gear 20, and now converts from rotary into alter nate back and forth movement as arrowed in fig 2. Back and forth movement is duly passed on to gears 15 and 16, causing nozzles 12 and 13 to turn therewith as one, moving through the wide arc aforedescribed. Gear 18 also sets up motion in gear 20 which in turn will drive rod 21, and this imparts the alternating back and forth movement to drive disc 16 which, being integral with nozzle 14, describes the tighter arc as aforedescribed.Since the jet thrown by nozzle 14 departs from the same vertical plane as that of jets thrown by nozzles 12 and 13, it follows that spray will be administered therefrom over a central, but decidedly more limited area than that delivered from the latter two.This being the case, the strip of land covered by jets from nozzles 12 and 13 as the tractor moves forward, will be covered at centre by the further spray from nozzle 14, obtaining the uniform coverage desired in administering the weed killer, or whatever.To explain more fully, the two jets delivered by nozzles 12 and 13 are not slow turning and uniformly swept, but rather, develop from the stand stili one has at points of inversion of said back and forth movement, to the considerable speed say, 200 km h at centre of the spray arc, down to zero once again at inversion. Thus, given the build up of angular velocity at centre of the arc, less of the spray will in fact fall down the corresponding central path travelled by the tractor, and it is this difference in quantity of the liquid actually administered that the branched V nozzle 14 makes up, since the branches thereof 23 and 24 are symmetrically disposed, and what is more, travel back and forth through a smaller arc and at greater frequency than nozzles 12 and 13.The fact of incorporating the three control cocks 3, 4 and 5 will also prove advantageous in certain instances, since shutting off one or more of these will create a different spray pattern. Were cock 5 to be left open by itself, for example, its corresponding nozzle 14 would be the only one in operation, and a relatively tight strip of lend could thus be sprayed.Likewise, if it were wished to lower the intensity of the spray, cock 3 could be closed off, whilst cocks 4 and 5 would be left open.The option also exists of mounting nozzle 14 so as to pass through the sleeve 32 about which gear 20 is made to turn, thus driven by the latter and caused to swing back and forth at the same frequency as the remaining two nozzles. Whilst such an arrangement would certainly offer economies in construction, efficiency in operation would be down graded with respect to the preferred embodiment described and illustrated.
