## Description
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING CIS 3,4 DIHYDRO N,N,2 TRIMETHYL 2H l BENZOPYRAN 3 AMINE AND INTERMEDIATESPRODUCED THEREBY This invention relates to a process for the production of cis 3,4 dihydro N,N,2 trimethyl 2H 1 benzopyran 3 amine of the following formula I , and to certain intermediates used in, and produced in, that production EMI1.1 As disclosed by Lockhart, I.M., in United StatesPatent No. 3,607,886, N,N,2 trimethyl 3 chromanamine, alpha isomer which is another name for the cis 3,4 dihydro N , N, 2 trimethyl 2H 1 benzopyran 3 amine designated compound I in the present invent ion exhibits anti depressant activity.According to the UnitedStates Patent No. 3,607,886, N,N,2 trimethyl 3chromanamine, alpha isomer and its acid addition salts may be produced by reacting 2 methyl 3 nitro 2H 1 benzdpyran with lithium aluminium hydride and hydrolyzing the resulting product to obtain a mixture of 2 methyl 3 chromanamine,alpha isomer and beta isomer, from which the alpha isomer is subsequently separated by a precipitation and recrystallization process. Thealpha isomer is then methylated to obtain the desiredN,N,2 trimethyl 3 chromanamine. In the United States Patent No. 3,629,289, a relatedLockhart patent, the alpha isomer of the 2 methyl 3chromanamine intermediate and the process for its production are more fully described. Bachman, et al., in J. Am. Chem Soc, 70 599 601 1948 disclose the preparation of 2 methyl 3aminochroman by hydrogenation of 2 methyl 3 nitro 1, 2 benzopyran using a Raney nickel catalyst, the term aminochroman being interchangeable with the term chromanamine . In the aforementioned United States Patents Nos.3,607,886 and 3,629,289, the distinction between the alpha and beta isomeric forms of the compounds prepared is discussed, particularly with respect to the physiochemical and pharmacological properties. Lovgren, K., Wet al., in Acta. Pharm. Suecica 14 21 29 1977 disclose the preparation of certain cis and trans 3 hydroxy 4 isopropylaminochromans starting with 6 methoxy 2H chromen. Lovgren, et al., recognize that two completely different syntheses are required to obtain the cis and trans isomeric configurations.intermediates formed during the synthesis of the trans isomers include trans 3 ,.4 dibromo 6 methoxychroman and trans 3 bromo 4 hydroxy 6 methoxychroman. However, as none of the Lovgren compounds have a 2 methyl substituent, this reference is concerned only with isomerism at the 3,4 position of the chroman ring. In the present invention, the 2 methyl substituent presents additional isomeric possibilities which are not considered in the Lovgren, et al., reference. The preparation, isomeric configuration and pharmacological properties of related aminochroman derivatives are discussed in the following references Huckle, et awl. J. Med. Chem. 12 277 279 1969 Lockhart, et al., J. Med. Chem. 15 863 865 1972 Sarda, et al., C.R.Acad. Sc. Paris 279 281 4 1974 Sarda, et al., Eur. J. Med. Chem. 11 251 257 1976 and Sarda, et al., Eur. J. Med. Chem. 11 257 262 1976 . In Japanese Application No. 52 083 829 Takeda Chemical Industries ring opening of an azirine derivative is achieved by hydrolysis thus 5,6 dihydroxy 1,1 alpha, 2,3,4,8b hexahydrobenzot3,4 cyclohepta 1,2 bgazirine is hydrolyzed to form 1,2,5 trihydroxy 6 isopropylamino 6,7,8,9 tetrahydra5H benzocycloheptene hydrobromide, a useful remedy for asthma. The azirine derivative of the sixth reaction step of the main overall process of the present invention involves a different ring system,and the ring opening is, instead, achieved by means of catalytic hydrogenation. According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a process fdr producing cis 3,4 dihydro N,N, 2 trimethyl 2H 1 benzopyran 3 amine having the formula I EMI3.1 or a non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, which process comprises the following steps 1. reacting a solution of 2 methyl 2H benzopyran having the formula II EMI4.1 in water and or in a non reactive, water miscible solvent with bromine to obtain, in situ, 3,4 dibromo 3,4 dihydro 2 methyl 2H 1 benzopyran having the formul IIa EMI4.2 2. treatingthe reaction mixture produced in Step 1 with water and neutralizing with an alkali to obtain 3,4 dihydro 3 bromo 2 methyl 2H 1 benzopyran 4 ol having the formula III EMI4.3 3. reacting compound III in water or a water miscible solvent, with an aqueous solution of methylamine to form, in situ, 3,4 epoxy 2 methylbenzopyran having the formula IIIa EMI5.1 and continuing the reaction to form 2 alpha, 3 beta, 4 alpha 3,4 dihydro 2 methyl 4 methyl amine 2H 1 benzopyran 3 ol having the formula IV EMI5.2 4. reacting sulphuric acid in an organic solvent with compound IV at a temperature above 110 C to obtain 2 alpha, 3 beta, 4 alpha 3,4 dhydro 2 methyl 4 methylamino 2H 1 benzopyran 3 ol, hydrogen sulphate ester having the formula V EMI5.3 5. heating compound V and an alkaline metal hydroxide to obtain la alpha, 2 beta, 7b alpha l,la,2,7b tetrahydro 1,2 dimethyl benzopyrano 3,4 bazirine having the formula VI EMI6.1 6. subjecting a solution of compound VI to catalytic hydrogenation to effect ring opening and formation of cis 3,4 dihydro N,2 dimethyl 2H 1 benzopyran 3 amine having the formula VII EMI6.2 and, 7. methylating a solution of compound VII to obtain compound I in the form of the free base or a non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof. In step 1 of the process the 2 methyl 2H 1 benzopyran II is in water and or in a non reactive, water miscible solvent, and is preferably in botch water and a nonreactive, water miscible solvent. Also, in step 1 of the process, the preferred solvent when present is tetrahydrofuran, and preferably the temperature of the reaction is maintained at approximately 70C 100C for about 45 minutes. In step 2 of the process of the present invention, the reaction mixture containing compound IIa is treated with water and preferably heated at reflux temperature for from 5 minutes to 3 hours, followed by neutralization with an alkali, for instance aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, to obtain compound III. In step 3 of the process of the present invention compound III dissolved in water or a different watermiscible solvent is reacted with an aqueous solution of methylamine, preferably while maintaining the temperature below 250C to form, in situ, compound IIIa.Examples of suitable watermiscible solvents for this step are lower alkanols, for example methanol and ethanol water miscible ethers, for example diglyme and dioxane and mixtures thereof. The preferred solvent is methanol. Generally, at least 2 molar equivalents moles of methylanline per mole of compoundIII are required, with a moderate to large excess of methylamine being preferred. As the second part of step 3 of the process according to the present invention, the reaction mixture containing compound IIIa is preferably refluxed for from one hour to 48 hours more preferably this phase of the reaction is conducted at from 200C to 30 0C for from 16 to 30 hours. The product of the reaction, compound IV, may be.isolated by conventional means, for example by evaporation, followed by crystallization. In step 4 of the process according to the present invention, sulphuric acid dissolved in an organic solvent, preferably a hydrocarbon solvent or a halogenated hydrocarbon solvent, reacts with compound IV to produce compound V. Examples of suitable organic solvents for use in step 4 are hydrocarbons, for example toluene and xylene chlorinated hydrocarbons, for example tetrachloroethane and chlorobenzene and mixtures thereof. The preferred solvent is xylene. The reaction mixture is conveniently heated at reflux under a water separator until water is no longer collected. Reflux temperatures above 110 0C are desirable. At 1350C to 1450C, the reaction usually goes to completion in about one to three hours.A slight excess of either reactant may be used, but approximately equimolar amounts of reactants are preferred. Compound may be isolated by conventional means, for example crystallization. In step 5 of the process according to the present invention, compound V is heated with an alkaline metal hydroxide, that is either an alkali metal hydroxide i.e. a hydroxide of a Group IA metal or an alkaline earth metal hydroxide i.e. a hydroxide of a GroupUA metal . Preferably there is used a strong base i.e.an alkali metal hydroxide, more preferably sodium hydroxide. At least two molar equivalents of alkaline metal hydroxide are usually required per mole of sulphate ester V, with an excess being preferred.While additional organic solvent is unnecessary in this step of the process, a two phase system of an aqueous alkaline solution and a water immiscible, non reactive organic solvent is desirable toluene is. the preferred organic solvent. The temperature of the reaction is not critical but, when toluene. is used as the organic solvent, a temperature of from 950C to 1000C and a reaction duration of 2 to 4 hours are preferred.Compound VI may be isolated by conventional means, for example evaporation of the organic phase. In step 6 of the process according to the present invention , a solution of compound VI is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation to effect ring opening and formation of compound VII examples of solvents suitable for producing the solution of compound VI are hydrocarbon solvents, for example benzene, toluene and xylene lower alkanols, for example methanol and ethanol ethers, for example tetrahydrofuran, dioxane and diglyme and mixtures thereof. For the hydrogenation, there may, for instance, be used noble metal catalysts such as platinum or palladium, and oxides thereof, optionally supported on a carbonaceous carrier such as charcoal. The preferred hydrogenation catalyst is palladium on a charcoal carrier. Hydrogen pressure during the hydrogenation is not critical and pressures of from 15 to 150 pounds per square inch 103.4 to 1034 kPa , are suitable, The hydrogenation is normally carried out at ambient temperature until no further hydrogen is taken up.Generally, one mole of hydrogen is required for complete conversion of one mole of the azirine compoundVI to compound VII. Compound VII may be isolated by standard procedures, for example by evaporation of solvent. Compound VII may also be isolated as a salt by reaction of the base with a suitable acid. In step 7 of the process according to the present invention, a solution of compound VII is methylated to obtain the desired compound I. Suitable methylating agents include, for instance, methyl halides, particularly methyl iodide dimethyl sulphate methyl sulphonates, such as methyl methanesulphonate and methyl p toluenesulphate mixtures of formaldehyde and formic acid formaldehyde and hydrogen in the presence of a noble metal catalyst and trimethyloxonium salts, such as trimethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate, trimethyloxonium tetrachloroferrate, trimethyloxonium hexafluoroantimonate and trimethyloxonium tetrachloroal urinate. When using the methyl halides, the methyl sulphates, dimethyl sulphate or trimethyloxonium salts as the methylating agent, the reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a base, for example potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate. The preferred methylating agent is a mixture of formaldehyde and formic acid. When using the preferred formaldehyde formic acid methylation procedure, excess formic acid can serve as the solvent for the reaction and additional solvent is neither necessary nor desirable. With other methylating agents, a variety of solvents may be used to produce the solution of compound VII these include hydrocarbons, for instance benzene, toluene and xylene ethers, for example diethyl ether, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran and diglyme lower alkanones, for instance acetone and 2 butanone with the exception that lower alkanone solvents are not used in hydrogenations with formaldehyde tertiary amides, for example dimethylformamide and N methyl 2 pyrrolidinone and mixtures thereof The temperature and duration of the methylation reaction of step 7 are not critical.In general, but not necessarily, the reaction may be carried out at 10 to 150bC or at reflux of the solvent, for from 48 hours to 20 minutes. Longer reaction times are necessary when lower temperatures are utilized. Using the preferred formaldehyde formic acid methylation procedure, a temperature of from 400cato 1000C for from 6 hours to 30 minutes is usually suitable. Generally, one mole of methylating agent is required per mole of primary amine VII .When using the preferred formaldehyde formic acid methylation procedure, a substantial excess of methylating agent is desirable. The final product, compound I, may be isolated as the free base or as a salt by standard procedures. The starting material, 2 methyl 2H l benzopyr an compound II used in the novel process of the present inyention is a known compound and is described by UrsulaKoch Pomeranz, et al., in Helv. Chim. Acta. 56 2981 at 2986 1973 wherein this starting material is prepared starting from l methylpropargyl phenyl ether. The novel process of the present invention is an improvement over previously known techniques for producing compound I in that certain hazardous intermediates required in the prior art techniques are avoided in the present invention. In addition, there is a substantial reduction in costs of starting materials and in the processing technique required. The final compound I, prepared according to the process of the present invention, is described in the aforementioned United States Patent No. 3,607,886 as having anti depressant activity as evidenced by positive results obtained in certain pharmacological assays compound I has been found to cause a significant suppression of hyper irritability in rats following doses of 12.5 to 100 mg kg, administered intraperitoneally and compound I was found to suppress the mouse killing instinct in killer rats when administered at a dose of 15 mg kg, administered intraperitoneally. Thus, compound I is indicated in the management of certain mental states such as depression when administered parenterally or orally to mammals. For administration, coupound I may be formulated according to methods well known to the pharmacists art.Typically, saline solutions of compound I are used for injectable purposes. For oral administration, cmpoundI may be administered in a saline solution or may be formulated with excipients such as lactose into tablets suitable for oral administration Other aspects of the present invention include the process for producing compound VII from compound II using steps 1 to 6 the process for producing compound I from compound IV using steps 4 to 7 the process for producing compound VII from compound IV using steps 4 to 6 the process for producing compound VII from compound VI using step 6 the process for producing compound VI from compound II using steps 1 to 5 the process for producing compound V from compound II using steps 1 to 4 the process for producing compound IV from compoundII using steps 1 to 3 the process for producing compound I from compoundVII using step 7 and the novel compounds IV, V, V and VII each of which is useful as an intermediate in one or more of the aforementioned process aspects of the present invention.
