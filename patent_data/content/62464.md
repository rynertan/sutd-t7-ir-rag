# Tracking system for a reading beam.

## Abstract
A laser or other beam reading system for a disc record 13 for example a video disc, provides an information signal at 25 , and a tracking error signal at 51 which can be used by way of a compensation circuit 27 and a amplifier 29 to con trol a tracking mirror 21 for steering the beam 11 laterally of the track 37 to keep it centered on the track. The tracking er ror signal 51 is also fed to a dimple compensation circuit 41 which can recognise a dimple, or other abnormality which might make the beam centre on an adjacent track, as shown at 35 , and can operate and F.E.T. switch 43 to render the beam steering system inoperative for as long as the tracking error signal exceeds a preset threshold value, or for a set time corresponding to the typical duration of an abnormality.
