# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR HIGH EFFICIENCY OPERATION OF ELECTROMECHANICAL ENERGY CONVERSION DEVICES

## Abstract
A method and apparatus are disclosed for controlling the conversion of electrical energy to mechanical energy as well as for controlling the conversion of mechanical energy to electrical energy. In a separately excited electromechanic al energy conversion system, total system power losses are minimized by simultaneously controlling the currents flow ing in the different windings of the energy conversion device such that these currents are related by an optimizing function. This method and apparatus are applicable to a wide variety of electric motors and generators. As an example the current I
