# Aseptic juice or beverage and flavour enhancement system therefor.

## Abstract
A process for making an aseptic juice, particularly orange juice, wherein an aseptic flavour system is created by adding a high proof alcohol to flavour concentrate ingredients, with the resulting aseptic flavour system being added to a previously pasteurized, drinkable strength juice. The resulting mixture is thereafter not heated for any purpose and is aseptically packaged to yield an aseptic finished product.
