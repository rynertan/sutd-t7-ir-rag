# A bulky spun yarn and a method for manufacturing the same.

## Abstract
A double layered yarn having a sheath and core structure is prepared through a roving process, drawing process or fine spinning process. The sheath portion of the yarn is composed of staple fibers A which have a high thermal shrinkage in boiling water of at least 5 , and the blended fiber ratio of which is between 50 and 25 . The core portion of the yarn is composed of staple fibers B which have the property of being spontaneously extensible, and the blended fiber ratio of which is between 25 and 75 . The double layered yarn is subjected to a heat treatment in hot water, and a bulky spun yarn which comprises staple fibers A and B is obtained. The staple fibers A are concentrated toward the inside of the bulky spun yarn after they are shrunk. The ends of staple fibers B are held within the inside of the bulky spun yarn, and the intermediate portions of fibers B bulge as loops from the body portion of the bulky spun yarn, after the fibers B are spontaneously extended.
