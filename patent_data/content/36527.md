# Low permeability dryer fabric.

## Abstract
A low permeabiiity dryer fabric woven from mono filament plastic polymeric warp strands and weft strands in which at least some of the weft strands 3, 6, 9, 12 exhibit preferential softening under the influence of heat, said strands adapting to conform to mesh interstices and thereby restrict the passage of air through the fabric.
