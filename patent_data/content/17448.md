# Electronic identification apparatus and identification system incorporating same.

## Abstract
A personal portable identifier contains a constant fre quency oscillator 16 from which a radiated carrier is obtained and counters 28 31 for deriving from the oscillator different frequency signals to modulate 62 the carrier according to a code peculiar to the identifier. The code has a series of bits each selecting a modulating frequency. The bit rate is derived from oscillator 16 by a counter decoder 32, 38 and the modulating frequencies are selected by switch ing units 50 55 operated by the decoder that provide a code sequence including start and stop control bits, identification data, and a group of bits selectively alterable by the user. Emergency data may also be encoded possibly onto a separate carrier source 95 . An identification system in cludes a receiver for use with a number of identifiers and including means for decoding each received bit sequence.
