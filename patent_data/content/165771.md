# Method of determining a phase difference between a rotating analyser and a rotary phase detecting means of an ellipsometer.

## Abstract
A rotating analyzer type ellipsometer comprises a rotat ing analyzer 27 for receiving light which is impinged on a sample 10, 10a with a predetermined incident angle and reflected by the sample, a rotary phase detecting apparatus 28 provided so as to rotate unitarily with the rotating analyzer 27 for generating a rotary phase signal as the rotary phase detecting apparatus 28 rotates, a rotating mechanism 60,61 for rotating the rotating analyzer 27 and the rotary phase detecting apparatus 28 , a photodetector 30 for producing an output responsive to light which is passed through the rotating analyzer 27 , and a computer 32 for obtaining a phase difference between the rotating analyzer 27 and the rotary phase detecting apparatus 28 from a phase difference Ã˜
