# Tracheostomy tube with disposable inner cannula.

## Abstract
A tracheostomy tube includes an outer cannula 12 and a removable, disposable inner cannula 14 . The inner cannula is provided with a tapered portion located just behind its distal tip 38 which forms simultaneously an air tight seal with the outer cannula and a stop device for preventing the protrusion of the tip substantially beyond the end 16 of the outer cannula. The stop device furthermore compensates for variations in the length of the inner cannula by controlling the position of the tip 38 between a location flush with the end 16 of the outer cannula and one just slightly beyond. A coupling connector 28 is mounted on the proximal end of the inner cannula to provide easy, releasable attachment of the inner cannula to the outer cannula. The inner cannulae are inexpensively constructed from a soft, flexible polyvinyl chloride material and are dimensionally compatible with any particular outer cannula.
