# DRIVE MECHANISM FOR A REFRIGERATOR WITH CLEARANCE SEALS

## Abstract
An improved cryogenic refrigerator having a drive mechanism suitable for use with gap or clearance seals is disclosed. The drive mechanism includes two reciprocating members, e.g. piston 30 and regenerator displacer 54, driven by a common rotating drive shaft 48. The regenerator displacer portion of the drive shaft includes a roller 64 at one end in engagement with a rod base plate for driving a rod 56 connected to the regenerator displacer 54 and a spring 62 for returning the regenerator displacer simultaneously with the withdrawal of the drive shaft. The piston portion of the drive shaft is connected to a first end of a hollow body 38. The second end of the hollow body which is opposite the first end has the piston 30 rigidly affixed thereto. The hollow body 38 has a portion adjacent the first end supported by a guide 42 whereby the piston is substantially isolated from side force loads during reciprocation.
