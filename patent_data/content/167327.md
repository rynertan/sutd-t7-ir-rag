# KERATOGRAPH AUTOSCANNER SYSTEM

## Abstract
A computer controlled system for displaying an image of a kerotograph taken by a video camera on a video monitor and determining the position dimensions of the Placido rings on the keratograph, then selectively correcting the measured data. An interface circuit is provided which digitizes and stores in the computer memory one video scan line at a time, and contains ring data storage and logic for superimposing ring data on the keratograph image.
