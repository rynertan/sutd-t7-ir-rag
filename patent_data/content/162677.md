# Method of forming a semiconductor device comprising an optical and an electronic element.

## Abstract
A semiconductor device includes a substrate 1 having a low substrate surface 15 formed in the substrate with a first gentle slope 15a from the substrate surface and a single crystalline layer formed on the low substrate surface nearly level with the substrate surface and having a gentle slope 15b facing the first gentle slope. An optical semiconductor element LD is constructed using the single crystalline layer and an electronic semiconductor element FET is con structed using the substrate surface. A wiring layer 31a con nects electrodes 25, 27 of the optical semiconductor element LD and the electronic semiconductor element FET through the first and the second gentle slopes, the slopes being gentle enough to reduce breakage of the wiring which can occur when steeper slopes, produced by conventional methods, are used.
