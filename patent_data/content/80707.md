# Construction for holding plastics film.

## Abstract
A construction for holding a bag shaped or sheet shaped continuous plastic film. In this holding construction, the plastics film is folded in a Z shaped manner such that linear cuts formed in the continuous plastics film are accurately superposed on one another, at least portions of insert members are inserted into the plastics film or the insert members are entirely inserted through the plastics film, so as to retain the plastics film in a bundled state, if one end portion of the film is drawn out, then a section of a predetermined length of the film is torn off along the linear cut or cuts by means of the insert members, and, when the section of the film is torn off, an end portion of the succeeding, i.e. second section of the film is automatically drawn out to a portion corresponding to the position where the end portion of the first section of the film has been initially positioned, through the action of connecting por tions other than the linear cut or cuts, so that the construc tion, in which the plastics film can be easily used one section after another in the same manner as the pop up take out method of tissue paper, can be obtained.
