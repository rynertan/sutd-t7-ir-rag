# GAS SENSITIVE COMPOSITE MATERIAL COMPRISING METAL AND DIELECTRIC AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCING SAME

## Abstract
A gas sensitive composite material comprises a porous dielectric having micropores and a thin film consisting of ultrafine metal particles dispersed in, and supported by, at least the porous surface layers of the dielectric. The gas sensitive composite material is produced by a method comprising the steps of forming a thin film of conductive ultrafine metal particles on at least the porous surface layers of a porous dielectric and dispersing the thin film metal, in a size similar to the pore opening, continuously or partly discontinuously in the porous layers, whereby a three dimensional composite material is obtained.
