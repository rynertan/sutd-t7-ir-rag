# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR THE CONVEYING AND RADIO FREQUENCY PROCESSING OF DIELECTRIC MATERIALS

## Abstract
Particulate dielectric material is provided by radio fre quency RF energy while being simultaneously conveyed from an inlet 42 to an outlet 18 by disposing the transmitting 62 and receiving 58 electrodes of an RF generator 74 diametrically opposite each other on the outside of a conveyor tube 16 containing a screw conveyor 44 both the tube and screw being made of dielectric material. A fiberoptic probe 76 is located at one end to sense the temperature of the particulate material in the conveyor tube and is connected at the opposite end to an infrared sensor 82 , which provides an electric output signal proportional to the sensed temperature. This output signal is coupled to a set point controller 84 which provides an electric output signal representing a small temperature range above and below a selected set point temperature, and the latter output signal is coupled to a duty cycle regulator 92 which operates to regulate the on time of the RF generator.
