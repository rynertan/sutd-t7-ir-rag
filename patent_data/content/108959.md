# Nickel high chromium base brazing filler metal for high temperature applications.

## Abstract
A nickel based high melting homogeneous, ductile brazing foil composition consists essentially of 17 to 20 atom percent chromium, 4 to 10 atom percent boron, 10 to 16 atom percent silicon, the balance being nickel and incidental impurities. The composition is such that the total of nickel and chromium ranges from 74 to 84 atom percent.
