# Novel random copolymer.

## Abstract
A random copolymer composed of ethylene, a 1,4,5,8 dimethano 1,2,3,4,4a,5,8,8a octahydronaphthalene and op tionally an alpha olefin having at least three carbon atoms or cycloolefin. The mole ratio of polymerized units from the 1,4,5,8 dimethano 1,2,3,4,4a,5,8,8a octahydronaphthalene to polymerized units from ethylene is from 3 97 to 95 5 and the 1,4,5,8 dimethano 1,2,3,4,4a,5,8,8a octahydronaphthalene is incorporated in the polymer chain as polymerized units without ring opening. The copolymer is prepared by copolymerizing ethylene, optionally the alpha olefin of at least 3 carbon atoms or cycloolefin, with the 1,4,5,8 dimethano 1,2,3,4,4a,5,8,8a octahydronaphthalene in a hydrocarbon medium in the presence of a catalyst formed from a vanadium compound and an organoauminum compound which are soluble in the hydrocarbon medium. The copolymer has excellent transparency and a well balanced combination of heat resistance, heat aging resist ance, chemical and solvent resistance, dielectric properties and mechanical properties such as rigidity.
