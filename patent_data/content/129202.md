# Stabilizing melt crystallization temperature in arylene sulfide polymer heat treatment.

## Abstract
A method for stabilizing the Tmc of PPS subjected to heat treatment in a temperature range between 240 C and 320 C, particularly during the heating process of an extrusion opera tion, by increasing the temperature of the polymer through the 240 C 320 C range at a rate of at least about 20 C per minute or by subsequently raising the temperature of the polymer to at least 350 C for a time sufficient to stabilize the Tmc of the polymer.
