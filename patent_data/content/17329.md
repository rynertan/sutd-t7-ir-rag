# Fuel control system for an internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
An i.c. engine fuel control system includes a main fuel control 19 which controls fuel flow to the engine in accordance with one or more engine operating parameters. The operation of the fuel control can be modified by a roughness sensing circuit 11 which produces a roughness signal output dependent on the magnitude of fluctuations of engine speed. This output is applied to an integrator 15 which provides a limited authority trim signal to the fuel control 19 in accordance with the time integral of the error between the roughness signal and a speed dependent reference signal generated by a speed shaping circuit 17 .
