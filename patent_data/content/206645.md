# Block copolymer.

## Abstract
A block copolymer consisting of segments of copolymer A, which is obtained by copolymerizing an aromatic vinyl monomer with a radically copolymerizable peroxycarbonate and has peroxy groups in its main polymer chain, and segments of co polymer B, which is different from copolymer A in the monomer composition and does not contain peroxy groups, can modify matrix resin without deteriorating the mechanical property of the resin.
