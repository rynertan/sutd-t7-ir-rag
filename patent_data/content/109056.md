# Rearward obstruction sensing system for automotive vehicle.

## Abstract
For detecting any obstructions existing within a plurality of warning areas A, B, C, D, E defined near the vehicle body, since four speakers 54a, 54b, 54c, 54d allocated to each of the warning areas are arranged near the four corners of the passenger compartment so as to face to the allocated warning areas when seen from the driver, when an obstruction is de tected within a warning area, a speaker 54a, 54b, 54c, 54d dis posed on the side of the warning area within which the detect ed obstruction exists begins to produce an intermittent alarm sound. Therefore, the driver can recognize the direction of an obstruction existing within dead angles from the driver intui tively or sensorily, without watching the zone display device while backing up his vehicle. Further, the driver can know the obstruction distance by distinguishing the period of the inter mittent alarm sound, because the period thereof is proprotion al to the obstruction distance.
