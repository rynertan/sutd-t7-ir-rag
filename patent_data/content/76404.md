# Method for recovery of gallium.

## Abstract
Gallium contained in a solution, especially a strongly basic aqueous solution can be effectively recovered by contacting the solution with a chelate resin having A NOH groups and B functional groups capable of forming a chelate bond with said functional groups A through gallium or a chelate resin having metal salt of said functional groups to adsorb gallium to the resin.
