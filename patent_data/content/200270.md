# Charge coupled device and camera comprising such a charge coupled device.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a charge coupled device, more particularly a sensor of the so called accordion principle, in which the charge packets are stored with a very high density and, in order to prevent signal mixing, are transported with a lower density. The logic circuits required for driving the sensor is integrated in the chip itself.
