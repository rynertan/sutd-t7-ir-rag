# Scaffold.

## Abstract
Scaffold comprising at least two vertical frames 1 con nected by tube shaped struts 2 , each frame being composed of one or more frame segments placed one on the other and each of said frame segments comprising two vertical tube shaped posts 4 that are rigidly connected to each other by fixed struts in which the upper ends of the posts 4 of one segment are connected in an undeformable manner to the lower ends of teh posts of the segment positioned above said one segment and in which the tube shaped struts are provided with end parts by means of which the struts are coupled to the vertical frames and in which said end parts each comprise a passage coaxial with the vertical tube shaped posts. Such a scaffold is not very stable. The invention improves the stability of a scaffold. This is obtained by the fact that the upper end of each post 4 is reduced in diameter in two steps, by the fact that the passage of each end part 11 is formed correspondingly, said passage matches about the reduced upper end of the post 4 , in which the step in the passage bears on the step of the first reduction 7 and the upper face of the end part 11 is substantially on the same height as the step of the second reduction 8 and by the fact that the second reduction 8 fits into the lower end of the post 4 placed there above.

## Description
Scaffold. The invention is related to a scaffold comprising at least two vertical frames connected by tube shaped struts, each frame being composed of one or more frame segments placed one on the other and each of said frame segments comprising two vertical tube shaped posts that are rigidly connected to each other by fixed struts, in which the upper ends of the posts of one segment are connected in a rigid and undeformable manner to the lower ends of the posts of the segment positioned above said one segment and in which the tube shaped struts are provided with end parts by means of which the struts are coupled to the vertical frames and in which said end parts each comprise a passage coaxial with the vertical tube shaped posts. Such a scaffold is known from Dutch patent specification 152.326. Here each end part is tube shaped and matches about the outer circumference of a vertical post. The end part is closed in between two horizontal struts. Each vertical post is provided at its lower end with a pin fixed therein and that fits in the upperend of the post placed below it. To hold the strut that is provided with end parts two horizontal fixed struts are needed. Moreover the connection between the end part and a post is not very rigid so the scaffold per s√© is not quite undeformable. The invention aims to improve the stability of such a scaffold and according to the invention this is obtained by the fact that the upper end of each post is reduced in diameter in two steps, by the fact that the passage of each end part is formed correspondingly, said passage matches about the reduced upper end of the post, in which the step in the passage bears on the step of the first reduction of the upper end of the post and the upperface of the end part is substantially on the same height as the step of the second reduction and by the fact that the second reduction fits into the lower end of the post placed there above. The end parts are held by the fact that the lower edge of the post placed thereabove abuts the step of the second reduction and the upper face of the end part. In this way a very stable scaffold is obtained. The end parts can be provided at the ends of diagonal or horizontal struts. Preferably the narrower part of the passage of the end part fits without clearance about the first step of the post. Such two steps reduction in diameter of tubes can be provided without much difficulty with the aid of the present art and the.reducted parts can have exact measures. It is preferred that the end parts of the struts are moulded parts with a rod like projection that permanently is connected in the ends of the tube shaped sturts. To make the scaffold to a fixed unit it is preferred that in the second reductions of each post and in the lower end of each post cross openings are provided for putting in a safety in or such. The invention now will be described with the aid of a drawing in which Fig. 1 is a side elevation of a part of the scaffold according to the invention Fig. 2 is a section along line Il Il in fig. 1 and Fig. 3 is a section of a connection ofsthe scaffold on a larger scale. The scaffold according to the invention comprises a number of vertical frames 1 that are mutually spaced. At least two vertical frames 1 are connected to each other by diagonal struts 2. Moreover between the frames 1 platforms 3 are provided. With the aid of said frames 1, diagonal struts 2 and platforms 3 in known manner a scaffold is erected. Moreover horizontal struts, not shown, can be used. The positioning of struts 2 between the frames 1 of a scaffold in general will suffice to stabilize a scaffold made up out of a plurality of frames. The frames comprise as know per se frame segments.Each frame segment comprises two tube shaped posts 4 that are fixed by horizontal struts 5 and support struts 6. If desired more horizontal struts 5 can be present in such a manner that the outer frame 1 can be used as a ladder. In fig. 3 the connection between two tube posts 4 and a diagonal strut is shown. The upper end of each tube post 4 is reduced in diameter in two stages, so a first step 7 and a second step 8 is formed. The tube post 4 so comprises at its upper end a first reduced part 9 and a second reduced part 10. Such a two stepped reduction in diameter can without difficulties be achieved with the aid of modern metal shaping technics. The diagonal strut is provided at both ends with a moulded end part 11 with a two stepped passage in such a manner that a step 12 is formed. The end part is provided with a tail portion 13 that is clamped in the end of the strut or is welded thereto. For a diagonal strut the tail part 13 defines an obtuse angle with the axis 0 of the passage. For a horizontal strut said angle is 90 In fig. 3 is shown that in case the end part 11 is positioned about the reduction of the tube 4 the upper face of end part 11 is at the height of step 8. The upper tube 4 in this way keeps the end part 11 on its place by the weight of the parts of the scaffold positioned above the end part. To lock the connection a cross pin 14 can be put through cross openings in the lower part of the tube placed above it and the reduced part 10 of the lower tube 4. The narrower part of the passage in the end part 11 fits without clearance about the first reduction 9.
