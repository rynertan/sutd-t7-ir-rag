## Description
AUTOMATIC GADGET DEVICED FOR LIFTS OR GOODS LIFTS WITHOUTSAFETY UFT SHAFrS. This new invention concerns an automatic gadget deviced for lifts or goods lifts without safety lift shafts.As we know, it has been established that lift or goods lifts plants must have a safety lift shaft, under the lowest floor. This lift shaft which has normally a 5 height of at least 50 cm, is made to protect the operator, even in a lying position during a maintenance work, in case of a sudden fall of the cabin from a wrong manoeuvre or for a faulty part of the safety system.There are some buildings in which the safety lift shafts cannot be absolutely realized, even there are some types, for example, those of the intermediate floors In which it is not possible to realize the safety lift shaft, according to the system that is now in use, that is, with a hole at the lowest floor.The demand for self contained transferable lifts or goods lifts is increasing, in which the gadget is contained in a supporting frame work. Such frame work can be connected to any floor from where the lift can be made to go upto one or more floors. But in this case it is very important not to create a safety lift shaft under the supporting floor.The scope of this present invention, is to provide a gadget which will allow the creation of a safety hole in the apparatus for lifts or goods lifts without safety measures.It has been found that this scope and other scopes provide an untied rafter which serves as a block and a support for the cabin, which is pivoted at the lower base of one of the guides. There are ways in which to maintain the said rafter tied to the guide during the normal movement of the lift, and there are elastics which push the said rafter below the level of the cabin creating an obstacle to the free discending of the same cabin, when the door of the cabin is opened.The means of maintaining the rafter tied to the guide of the frame work is by hooking action provided by the gadget when the door is opened. When the cabin gets to a floor and the door is opened the rafter remains tied to the guide by the action of the same cabin. In the revise action without the cabin, the rafter is unhooked when the door is opened, like this it lowers from the vertical position creating a support of at least 50 cm high on which the cabin gets to, by a wrong manoeuvre or by a faulty part of the safety system, gets to a stop.Like this it is created under the cabin a free hole which is equivalent to the traditional safsty hole. For better illustration of the constructive and functional parts of the gadget, descriptions with references are attached but without details Figure 1 illustrates schematically the gadget in its opening position, showing the blocking and the supporting of the cabin. Figure 2 illustrates the gadget of the figure 1 in its tied position to the guide slide.The frame work of a lift is illustrated in the figures, which is indicated by the main guider and a cabin B which with a traditional mechanism not show here can descend to the lowest floor C, like this door A can be opened.These are the conditions of the normal working of the gadget.During maintenance, the door A is opened with a safety key, while the cabinB is found at a floor higher than the lowest floor C. It is important to protect the operator who is working under the cabin not to be crushed by the returning of the cabin which may be caused by anything.At this juncture, at the base and side of the T beam guide 2 along which slides guide 3 of the cabin B, is mounted a gadget which blocks and supports cabin B, which is the object of the present invention. The said gadget of block and support comprises of a rafter 1 hinged at the base of beam 2 and is capable of opening by itself to a certain angle, like this, forming a block and a support of the cabin which arrives. To rafter 1 is hinged a lever 6 on which acts a spring thrust 7 fixed to a beam of the lift or goods lift.The said lever 6 is provided with a stopslit 5 in which the head of a bolt 4 can be inserted. A spring 9, fixed at the extreme of bolt 4, withdraws the head of the said bolt from slit 5, when door A is opened, by means of any gadget, preferably the flexibles. When bolt 4 is inserted in slit 5, rafter 1 gets tied to beam 2 see fig. 2 and the cabin B is free to slide. If cabin B is not on the same level with a floor of a building rafter 1 is being pushed by spring 7 through the lever 6 and it is liberated from bolt 4 followed by the opening of the door which becomes automatically opened or inclined, forming a block and a support for cabin B as indicated in figure 1.But if cabin B is found at the same level with a floor, rafter 1 which is liberated from bolt 4 as a result of the opening of the door, becomes blocked from opening or inclining for the presence of the same cabin. It is better that rafter 1 is got rollers 10 at the free extreme, so that the rollers will slide along guide 3 of cabin B and maintaining the said rafter tied to beam 2, even when bolt 4 is unhooked from the opening of the door A. Closing of door A makes bolt 4 to insert in slit 5, and thereby blocking rafter 1. After the maintenance operation, the operator closes again door A, then recalls rafter 1 in a tied position to beam 2 with any gadget or by hand through an entry hole 8.When slit 5 of lever 6 corrisponds exactly with extreme of bolt 4, the bolt which is being pushed from spring 9, enters the slit 5 and blocks rafter 1 in an erect tied position to beam 2. Cabin B can now slide freely by the side of rollers 10 which slide along guide 3 of cabin B and maintaining the said rafter tied to beam 2, even when bolt 4 is unhooked from the opening of door A. The closure of door A makes bolt 4 to be inserted in slit 5, thereby blocking rafter 1. After the maintenance operation, the operator closes again door A, recalls back rafter 1 to a tied position to beam 2 with any gadget or by hand through an entry hole 8. When slit 5 of lever 6 corrisponds exactly with the extreme of bolt 4, this bolt which is being pushed by spring 9, enters slit 5 and makes rafter 1 to be blocked in an erect tied position to beam 2. Cabin B can now slide freely beside rollers 10 which can as well slide along guide 3. In these conditions if door A is opened in the presence of cabin B, rafter 1 will not expand, because it is blocked by the same cabin B.Naturally door gadgets can differ and can be adapted to suit any type of project as far as it is not beyond the scope of this present invention.
