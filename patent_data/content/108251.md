# A SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE COMPRISING AN ELECTRODE AND OR AN INTERCONNECTION

## Abstract
A semiconductor device comprising an electrode or interconnection made of an insulator film 2 , a tungsten film 3 and a phosphosilicate glass film 4 which are stacked and formed on a semiconductor substrate 1 . Canneling attri buted to the punch through of ions during ion implantation and fluctuations in the threshold voltage can be effectively prevented, so that the semiconductor device has stable characteristics.
