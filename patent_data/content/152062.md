# IMPROVED CANNULA HUB DEVICE

## Abstract
An improved cannula and hub assembly has a recess in the hub which provides for the mounting of a placement member. Projecting wing like segments which protrude from the placement member provide surfaces on which force may be exerted when inserting the cannula into a patient. Once the cannula has been properly placed within the patient the placement member may be removed from the cannula hub.
