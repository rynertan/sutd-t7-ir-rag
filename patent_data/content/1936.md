# Process for the production of acetaldehyde by the reaction of methanol with synthesis gas.

## Abstract
Acetaldehyde is produced by reacting methanol with hydrogen and carbon monoxide at elevated temperature and pressure in the presence of a catalyst comprising cobalt, an iodide or a bromide and one of the elements arsenic, antimony or bismuth, either in the form of the free element or a compound thereof, and in the additional presence of one or more of the following additives i an inert liquid such as chlorobenzene, decanoic acid, a polydimethylsiloxane fluid or a methyl phenyl silicone fluid, ii an acid and or an acid derivative such as acetic acid, acetic anhydride, propionic acid, phenylacetic acid, benzoic acid, methyl acetate or butyl acetate. iii an oxygen containing organic compound such as 1,4 dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, di n propylether, diphenylether acetone, acetaldehyde, n propanol or n butanol. iv a non polar solvent such as an alkane, benzene or an alkyl substituted benzene. The presence of the additive suppresses by product formation and thereby improves the yield and selectivity to acetaldehyde.
