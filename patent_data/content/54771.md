# Digital formatting system.

## Abstract
An improved method and apparatus for transforming digital information into a special format similar to that of a standard color video signal. The special format includes a multilevel baseband component corresponding to the luminance component of a standard video signal, and a phase and or amplitude modulated subcarrier correspond ing to the chrominance component of a video signal. This format is highly efficient and takes better advantage of high signal to noise ratio channels, and the signal can be transmitted over standard video channels and conventional video circuitry can be used to process it.
