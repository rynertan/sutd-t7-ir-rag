# Process and apparatus for off gas recovery.

## Abstract
Ways and means are provided for increasing the fuel value of off gas 20 recovered from oxygen blowing steel converters 10, 100 . Carbon is introduced into an off gas capture hood 22 to react with carbon dioxide therein to form carbon monoxide. A carbon dioxide curtain 61 is formed which surrounds the inlet end of the gas capture device 22 to prevent air from entering the capture device. Carbon dioxide is drawn from the carbon dioxide curtain 61 into the capture device 22 to mix with the gases therein.
