## Abstract
An improved MOS transistor construction utilizes a polysilicon gate covered by silicide and silicide covered, self aligned source and drain regions separated from the gate polysilicon by thin silicon dioxide spacers. No contact windows are formed within the perimeter of the isolation island. This allows for very small geometries Electrical contact to the source and drain regions is provided by a conductive pattern formed in a layer of refractory metal which is in electrical contact with the source, drain and gate silicide and which extends over the field oxide to contact pad positions outside the isolation islands of the transistors. The contact pads located outside the isolation islands support post type vias or contact windows. The posts can be formed of different heights so that electrical contact by first and second metal layers to the source, gate and drain regions of the device can be made with the first and second metal layers separated by intermetal insulation. A process is disclosed for making high performance bipolar and high performance MOS devices on the same integrated circuit die which comprises forming isolation islands of epitaxial silicon surrounded by field oxide and forming MOS transistors having polysilicon gates in some islands and forming bipolar transistors having polysilicon emitters in other islands. Insulating spacers are then formed around the edges of the polysilicon electrodes by anisotropi cally etching a layer of insulation material. A layer of refractory metal is then deposited and heat treated at a temperature high enough to form silicide over the tops of the polysilicon electrodes and on top of the bases, sources and drains. Regions of this refractory metal are then masked off such that the electrical contact with the silicide is preserved ans so that the refractory metal extends to a contact pad position external to the isolation island. Metal posts can be formed at the contact pad positions and a layer of planarized insulation material is formed so as to leave only the tops of the posts exposed. A layer of metal can then be deposited and etched to make electrical contact with tops of the posts. There is also disclosed a dynamic RAM cell using MOS transistor and a CMOS static RAM cell comprising six MOS transistors having source, drain and gate electrodes which are smaller than the smallest contact window which can be made by the process which was used to make the transistor.
