# PRESSURE COMPENSATED TEMPERATURE SWITCH UNIT FOR PROTECTION OF AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE

## Abstract
A pressure compensated temperature switch for the protection of an internal combustion engine is disclosed, which includes a housing 20 , a portion of which is positioned within a passage 14 in the cooling system of the internal combustion engine. The cooling system is adapted to contain a coolant fluid. Within the housing 20 is a pressure sensitive member 50 . The pressure sensitive member 50 contains a fluid which has substantially the same composition as the fluid in the cooling system. A visual and or audible alarm device is connected to the switch unit, so as to operate when temperature conditions exist within the engine which are harmful to the engine.
