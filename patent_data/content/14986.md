## Description
Revolving Reflectors for BicyclesThe present invention relates to a revolving reflector for bicycles and the like hereafter referred to as bicycles , designed to help prevent accident at night by making the bicycles more readily visible to the drivers of cars.There are regulations with respect to the reflectors for use with cars which have done good in preventing car accidents. Recently bicycles provided with improper refelectors have become the subject of control of the regulations, but still the accidents of bicycles with cars frequently occur, particularly at night.Conventional reflectors for use with bicylces can be roughtly classified into the following three types 1 First type Reflectors attached to the rear fender rear mudgurad of bicycles 2 Second type Reflectors and fluorescent tapes attached to the pedals an d pedal frames of bicycles 3 Third type Reflectors attached to the spokes of front wheels and rear wheel of bicyclesThe above mentioned reflectors for preventing accidents of bicycles with cars, however, have the following shortcomings The reflectors of the first type are effective by and large from the viewpooint of the construction of bicycles, if they are properly attached to the rear fender and there is no problem in the angles of incidence and reflection in the reflectors.However, since the reflectors themselves downot movç,the drivers of approaching cars cannot see and recognize the relectors quickly, for example, under the following circumstances a In a street with colorful signboards and illuminated signboards or on a road which is wet with rain and is illuminated by neon light. b In an unilluminated steet or road which is curved and is provided with reflectors for indicating the edges of the street, the height of the reflectors is almost the same as that of the reflectors of bicycles. c Under the circumstance of either a or b mentioned above, when the color of the clothes of the rider of bicycle is siMilor to the color of the background and the rider is not readily visible to the drivers of cars, for instance, a black coat at night or a white jacket in the street covered with snow.As to the reflectors and fluorescent tapes attached to the pedals and pedal frames of bicycles of the second type, they are rotated together with the pedals and help the drivers of approaching cars to see and recognize the bicycle. However, when the pedals are muddy, their light reflection performance is reduced significantly. Furthermore, when the rider happens to wear shoes which may cover the pedals completely and make the reflectors and fluorescent tapes invisible to the drivers of cars, the the reflectors and fluorescent tapes do not perform their intended function, while the rider does not notice it. Those shortcoming cannot be removed from the reflectors and fluorescent tapes of the second type.The reflectors attached to the spokes of the front wheels and rear wheels of bicylces of the third type make greater movement than the reflectors of the second type and are more effective in giving warnings to the car drivers than the reflectors of the first type and the second type. However, the reflectors of the third type are designed so as to be useful only when the rider crosses the road and therefore they are not readily visible to the drivers of cars approaching from behind or in front of the bicycles.It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a revolving reflector for bicycles capable of reflecting light dynamically upon receiving light thereby,twinkling and sparkling intesely, helping the drivers of approaching cars to see and recognize the bicycle and its rider quickly, so that accidents of bicycles can be prevented. Another obj ct of the present invention t6 pro ideca revolving reflector for bicycles which reflects light constantly so as to be visible to the drivers of cars at any condition.A further object of the present invention is to provide a revolving reflector òr bicycles which is low in the cost but has a high light reflecting performance.A still further object of the present invention is to provide a revolving reflector for bicycles which is visible from any position. According to the present invention, the revolving reflector comprises a revolving reflector member which is rotated by the wind, which reflects light, twinkling and sparkling by use of a spiral light reflecting material attached to a rotating member.Furthermore, according to the present invention, in order to prevent the rotating member from being rotated too fast and giving an impression as if it is a stationary reflecting light, when the wind is too strong or the bicycle is run at high speed, a speed control apparatus is provided for controlling the revolution of the rotating member, and even if the wind is weak or the bicycle is stopped, the rotating member is rotated by weak wind.Furthermore, according to tkrepresent invention, the construction of the revolving reflector is simple and can be attached to any part of the bicycle by use of ordinary fixing parts. In particular, it can be attached to the h b of either wheel of the bicycle. Therefore, it is visi ble from any position.The other objects and features of the invention can be readily understood from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments according to the invention in conjunction with the brief description of the drawings.Fig. 1 is a perspective view of an embodiment of a revolving reflector for bicycles according to the invention.Fig. 2 is a perspective view of the revolving reflector ofFig. 1, which includes a partial fragmentary view of the revolving reflector.Fig. 3 is a perspective view of another embodiment of a revolving reflector for bicycles according to the invention.

In Fig. 1, reference numeral 1 represents a main frame of the revolving reflector. The main frame 1 is made of a crosswise cut square pipe and a fixture la is fixed to the main frame by welding or ribets. In the fixture la, there is formed a hole lb for allowing a bolt to pass therethrough in order to fix the main frame 1 to the bicycle. In an upper space within the main frame 1, there is disposed pivotally a rotation control drum 3, and in a lower space within the main frame 1, there is disposed pivotally a revolving reflector late . Fig. 2 is a partly fragmentary view of the revolving reflector of Fig 1 for a better understanding of its con struction. As shown in Fig. 2 ç in a central portion of a top portion of the main frame 1 and in a central portion of a bottom portion of the main frame 1, there are formed holes lc, ld,respectively. A shoulder screw 4, which serves as a bearing, is caused to pass through the hole lc and a hole 3 formed in the central portion of the rotate tion control control drum 3 and is fixed to the main frame 1 by a nut 5. A shoulder scew 4a, which also serves as a bearing, is likewise caused to pass through the hole Id and is fixed to the main frame 1 by a nut 5 .Between the thus attached bearings, namely the shoulder screws 4 and 4a, the revolving reflector plate 2 is disposed in the following manner.A top portion and a bottom portion of the revolving reflectc 2 on its vertical axis are respectively inserted tightly into the slots formed in shafts 2a1 2b, and in the shafts 2a, 2b, there are formed spot facings 4 , 4a , respectively and projected portions of the shoulder screws 4, 4a are fitted into the spot facings 4 , 4a , so that the revolving reflector plate 2 can be rotated smoothly on the projected portions of the shoulder screws 4, 4d through the shafts 2a, 2b.The opposite sides of the revolving reflector plate 2 are curved in the opposite directions so as to be rotated efficiently in the wind. In this embodiment, there is provided a speed control means for controlling the rotation of the revolving reflector plate 2 so as not to be revolved too fast in strong wind or when the speed of the bicycle is increased.In this embodiment, the rotation of the reflector plate 2 is controlled by use of the centrifugal force generated when the revolving reflector plate 2 is xevolwtd too tast. To be more specific, a spiral spring 3a is i d to a top portion of the shaft 2a by a screw, and when the rxvolvizxs reflector plate 2 is rotated too fast, the spiral spring 3a is pushed away from its center and its outer surface is brought into contact with the inner surface of the rotation control drum 3, so that the rotation of the revolving reflector plate 2 is controlled by the friction of the spiral spring 3a against the inner surface of the rotation control drum 3.In an end portion of the outer surface of the spiral spring 3a, there is embedded a piece of hard rubber 3b in order to increase the centrifugal force of the spiral spring 3a as well as its speed control perform ance.As shown in Fig.l, the psiral spring 3a is entirely built in the rotation control drum 3. The elastic strength of the spiral spring 3a is adjusted in such a manner that the hard rubber 3b is positioned away from the inner surface of the rotation control drum 3 during normal rotation of the revolving reflector plate 2.In this embodiment, one side of the revolving reflector plate 2 is plated to reflect light effectively and the other side is coated with a fluorescent paint. It will be more preferable that the reflector plate 2 be made of such a reflector as is used in the tail reflectors of cars.Referring to Figs. 3, there is shown another rotation control device for controlling the rotation of the reflector plate 2, which corresponds to the spiral spring 3a in the above mentioned embodlment. In this device, spring plates 3a , 3b are fixed by screws to the opposite outer sides of the shaft 2a.Fig. 3 particularly shows perspectively the speed control device in operation.Referring to Fig. 4, thereto shown a further rotation control device for controlling the rotation of the reflector 2. In this device, the end portions of spring plates 6, 6 t are attached to the opposite sides 2c, 2d of the reflector plate 2 whose opposite sides are bent in the opposite directions for effective rotation by the wind and hard rubber pieces 6a, 6b which are embedded respectively in the other end portions of the spring plates 6, 6 . When the reflector plate 2 is rotated at a speed beyond a predetermined limit, the spring plates 6, 6 are moved outwards by centrifugal force, so that the hard rubber pieces 6a, 6b of the spring plates 6, 6 are caused to strike against the inner surface of the main frame 1 shown in Fig. 2.Fig. 5 shows a still further rotation control device In this device, the spring plates 6, 6 in Fig. 4 are replaced with a ring shaped member which is represented by reference number 7. The ring member 7 is fixed to the revolving reflector 2 by welding or rivets at the opposite side portions 2e, 2f of the reflector plate 2, and at the central portions of the ring member 7 between the fixed portions thereof, there are embedded hard rubber pieces 7a, Th. When the revolving reflector plate 2 is rotated at a speed beyond a predetermined limit, the ring member 7 becomes oval in the shape by centrifugal force and the hard rubber pieces 7a, 7b come into contact with the inner surface of the main frame 1, so that the rotation of the reflector plate 2is controlled. The spring plates as mentioned above are selected such that they do not control the rotation of the revolving reflector plate 2 when the relector plate 2 is in normal rotation, from the viewpoint of the kind of material, thickness and width of the spring plate and the centrifugal force applied to the spring plates during the rotation of the reflector plate 2. Pig. 6 shouo how the embodiment of the revolving reflector tor bicycles as shown in Figs. 1 and 2 is attached to the bicycle in practice. In Fig. 6, the main frame 1 of the revolving reflector is attached to a shaft 8 of the rear wheel of a bicycle. The revolving reflector according to the invention can be attached to any portion of the bicycle as long as it is safe and suitable for the reflection of light from the reflector.In Fig. 6, reference numeral 1 represents the main frame of the revolving reflector, reference numeral 8 the shafts of the rear wheel of the bicycle, reference numeral 8a a nut for fastening the shaft 8 of the rear wheel, reference numeral 9 the body of the bicycle, reference numeral 1C1 a support member for supporting a luggage carrier, reference numeral 11 a chain guard, and reference numeral 13 spokes.Fig. 7 is a perspective view of another embodiment of a revolving reflector for bicycles according to the invention, which includes a partial broken view of the revolving reflect. In this embodiment, a revolving reflector plate 14 is also rotated by te wind. However, unlike the embodiments of the revolving reflectors so far exaplained, the rotation shaft of the revolving elector plate 14 is disposed horizontally.In Fig. 7, a main frame 13 of the revolving relector forks into two parts. In an upper portion of the revolving reflector, there extends an attachment portion in which a hole 13a is made for allowing a bolt to pass therethrough in order to attach the revolving reflector to the body of the bicycle. The attachment portion is S shaped so that the revolving reflector can be attached to any type of bicycles. Inside the lower forked portions of the main frame 13, the revolving refelector plate 14 is pivotally mounted on a shaft 14e which is embedded into a central portion of the revovling reflector plate 14. The opposite end portins 14a, 14b of the revolving reflector plate 14 are curved as shown in Fig. 7 so that the reflector plate 14 is rotated by the wind when one rides the bicycle.In Fig. 7, reference numerals 14, 14d each represent bearing holes of the reflector plate 14. As in the case of the so far mentioned revolving reflectors accordino to the invention, the revolving reflector plate 14 can be made of metal or synthetic resin. Alternatively the reflector plate 14 can be made of a reflection mirror for cars, which reflects light intensely when it is illuminated by head light of cars at night. In Fig. 6, the reflection mirror is shown by cross stripes. The main frame 13 of the revolving reflector can be attached to any portion of the bicycle as long as it is safe and a sufficient wind for the rotation of the revolving reflector plate 14 can be obtained and a high light reflecting performance can be obtained.Referring to Fig. 8, there is shown perspectively a further embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, the rotation shaft of a propeller like reflector 17 is disposed parallel to the running direction of the bicycle unlike the so far explained embodiments of the invention in which each rotation shaft of the reflector plates is disposed normal to the running direction of the bicycle. In Fig. 8, a main frame 15 of the revolving reflector is a ring which can be made, for example, by cutting crosswise a pipe. Am attachment member 15a is fixed to the main frame 15 by welding or rivets and inside the main frame 15, the propeller like reflector plate 17 is rotatably disposed.The reflector plate 17 can be made of metal or synthetic resin and the front and back sides of a half portion of the propeller like plate are made of the previously mentioned reflection mirror for cars. The thus constructed reflector plate 17 is pivotally mounted on. a bearing 16 and is supported by the main frame through a boaring support member 16a.Fig. 9 shows perspectively a still further embodiment of a revolving reflector for bicycles according to the inven tion. In this embodiment, a revolving reflector plate 19 is rotated by the rotation of a wheel of bicycle, u flke he so far explained revolving reflector plates which are rotated by the wind. Since a main frame 18 of the revolving reflector is the same as thezmain frame 1 in the embodiment of Figs.1 and 2, its explanation is omitted here. The revolving reflector plate 19 is made in such a shape and size so as to be rotatable inside the main frame 18 and one side 6f the reflector plate 19 is finished like a mirror, for example, by plating, and the other side of the reflector plate 19 is made of the previously mentioned reflection mirror for cars or the reflection mirror is fixed to the other side of the revolving reflector plate 19. The thus constructed revolving reflector plate 19 is fixed to shafts 19a, 19b in the same manner as in the case of the revolving reflector in Figs. 1 and 2. More specifically, a top portion and bottom portion of revolving reflector 19 on its vertical axis are respectively inserted tightly into the slots formed in the shafts 19a, 19b.One end of a flexible shaft 21 is inserted into the shaft 19b and is supported rotatably in association with an upper bearing 20. The flexible shaft 21 passes through a protecting cable 21a. The other end of the flexible shaft 21 is connected to a speed meter which is attached to bicycles for aporta, so as to follow the rotation of a wheel of the bicycle. In a lower portion of a bearing 20a, there are formed threads which engage with a knurled screw 21b which is attached to an end portion of the protecting cable 21a of the flexible shaft 21.Fig. 10 shows perspectively a further embodiment of a revolving relector for bicycles according to the invention in which a revolving reflector is rotated by the wind. InFig. 10, reference numeral 51 represents a main frame of the revolving reflector which is approximately in the shape of topped U. In a central portion of itotihe main frame 51, there is further formed a smaller toppled U shaped portion.in which an attachment hole 52 is formed. To an end portion of an upper portion of the main frame 51, there is fixed a bearing 53 by a screw. To an end portion of a lower portion of the main frame 51, there is also fixed a bearing in the same manner as mentioned above. Inside the main frame rotatably 51, there is disposed a rotating member between the above mentioned upper bearing 53 and the lower bearing. The rotating member is rotated by the wind when the bicycle is running.The rotating member will now be explained in more detail by referring to Fig 11 which is a plan view of Fig. 10. InFig. 11, reference numeral 54 represents a cylinder to which peripheral surface of a spiral light reflecting material 54a having a predetermined width is attached. Reference numerals 55, 56 and 57 each represent wind receiving blades in the shape of a circular arc in their respective vertical directions The wind receiving blades 55, 56, 57 anrsqpported by the cylinder 54 and their upper portions are inserted into grooves 58b of a disc 58 and fixed thereto by welding, and their lower portions are also inserted into grooves 58b of a disc 58a and fixed thereto by welding. In a central portion of each of the discs 58, 58a, there is further formed a hole, and a shaft which is longer than the cylinder 54 is passed through the holes and fixed thereto in a manner such that the opposite ends of the shaft are projected from the discs 58, 58a by an equal length. In Fig. 11, the wind receiving blades 55, 56, 57 are arranged in the same direction, so that in tis embodiment, the cylinder 54 is rotated clockwise by the wind.Fig. 12 perspectively shows a further embodiment of a revolving reflector for bicycles according to the invention.Also in this revolving reflector, a revolving reflector member is rotated by the wind. In Fig. 12, reference numeral 60 represents a main frame of the revolving reflector, which has an attachment hole 61 for attaching the revolving reflector to part of a bicycle. The whole shape of the main frame 60 is shaped like a quarter of a Silocco fan when it is viewed from the shaft of the fan. To an upper portion and a lower portion of the main frame 60, bearings 62, 62a are fixed respectively.by screws. In the main frame 60, a cylinder 63 around which a reflecting material is wound in viral is disposed in a window 67 positioned in a central portion of a rotating member 64, and the rotating member 64 is pivotally mounted so as to be readily rotated by the wind which blows in the direction of the arrow inFig. 12.Referring to Fig. 13, the rotating member 64 in Fig. 12 will now be explained in more detail. Fig. 13 shows an enlarged perspective view of the rotating member 64. The rotating member 64 constitutes a wind receiving blade whose opposite side portions 64a, 64b are curved as shown in Fig. 13. To an uppermost portion and a lowermost portion on the vertical central Bxis of the rotating member 64, there are fixed respectlvely shafts 65, 65 by press fits 65a, 65b.Furthermore, as mentioned previously, there is formed the window 67 in the central portion of the rotating member 64, and into the window 67, there is fitted the cylinder 63 in a manner such tat one half of the rotating member 64 is projected equally from the rotating member 64. In Fig. 13, a star mark represents a light reflecting material to be sticked on the rotating member 64. Fig. 14 shows how to attach the revolving reflector as shown in Figs. 12 and 13 to a bicycle in practice. In Fig. 14, reference numeral 60 represents the main frame of the revolving reflector. The revolving reflector is fixed to the shaft of a front wheel of the bicycle by screws, utilizing the nut of the shaft. Thus, the rotating member 64 is rotated by the wind. In this embodiment, the light reflecting material has a visual effect as if it moves upwards so that it is readily visible to the car drivers. In Fig. 14, the body of the bicycle is designated 68, a front fender 69, a tire 70, spokes 71, and a lamp 72.In Fig. 15, there is perspectively shown a further embodiment of a revolving reflector of the type which is revolved by the wind according to the invention In Fig. 15, a main frame of the revolving reflector is designated 101, which has an attachment portion 102 for attaching the main frame 101 to part of the bicycle. In the attachment portion 102, there is formed an attachment hole 103. The main frame is in the shape of a crosswise cut square pipe In the central portion each of an upper and a lower portion of the main frame 101, there is formed a screw hole in which a conic bearing 104 can be screwed. The conic bearings are screwed in the screw holes and fixed thereto by nuts 105 in both the upper and the lower portion of the main frame 101. Between both the conic bearings 104, there is rotatably disposed a rotating member.The rotating member will now be explained in more detail.In Fig. 15, reference numeral 106 represents a cylinder having, on its peripheral surface, a spiral light reflecting material 107 The Opposite upper and lower ends of the cylinder 106 are fixed to an upper disc ill and a lower disc 112. In the ipper and lower discs 111, 112, there are embedded the opposite ends of wind receiving blades 108, 109, llO,which are disposed at an equal space therebetween parallel to a generating line of the cylinder 106. A shaft having sharp ends is disposed so as to pass through the central portions of the upper disc 11 and the lower disc 112 and to be fixed thereto, projecting from the upper and lower discs 111, 112 by an appropriate length.Thus, the cylinderl06 is supported by the conic bearings 104 between the upper and lower discs 111, 112 in the manner of antifriction.Fig. 16 is a section takenon line A A in Fig. 14. In this embodiment, the wind receiving blades 108, 109, 110 are rectangular in the shape and are bent almost at right angle in the direction of their longitudinal axis. Furthremore, in tis embodiment, in order to rotate the wind receiving blades 108 109, 110 counterclockwise about the shaft 113, they are disposed at a predetermined distance 108a, 109a, 110a from the peripheral surface of the cylinder 106, while their respective convex portions are positioned at an angle of 1200 to each other in the counterclockwise direction.Since spaces 108a, 109a, 110a are placed between the cylinder 106 and the wind receiving blades 108, 109, 110, the receiving blades 108, 109, 110 cannot be balanced by any wind. Therefore the wind receiving blades 108, 109, 110 are immediately rotated by any wind if it is strong enough to rotate them.In Fig. 17, there is perspectively shown a further embodiment of a revolving reflector of the type which is revolved by the wind according to the invention. In Fig. 17, reference numeral 114 represents a support member for supporting a rotating member, one end of which serves as a shaft having a sharp end as well and in which a groove for a retaining ring is formed, and the other end of which has an attachment hole for attaching the revolving reflector to part of a bicycle. Reference numeral 116 represents a cylinder having a spiral light reflecting material 117 on the peripheral surface of the cylinder 116, numerals 118, 119 and 120 each represent wind receiving blades, and numerals 121 and 122 represent members equivalent to the upper disc 111 and the lower disc 112 in Figs. 15 and 16.A conic bearing is embedded in a central portion of the bottom of the conic head portion represented by the numeral 121. One end of the shaft having the sharp end support member 114 is passed through the center of the skirt like disc represented by the numeral 122, so that the cylinder 116 is supported by the above mentioned bearing and the shaft in such manner of anti friction. In order that the cylinder 116 is rotated readily, there is also formed an unloaded hole. In order to prevent the rotating member from being detached, the retaining ring is provided so as to be rotatable in the groove formed in the support member 114 on the bottom side of the skirt like disc 122. Fig. 18 shows how to attach the revolving reflector as shown in Figs. 15 and 16 to a bicycle In Fig. 18, the revolving reflector is attached to the right side of the front wheel of the bicycle. In Fig. 1E, the numeral 101 represents a support member for supporting the rotatable member, and numeral 102 represents an attachment member for attaching the support member 101 to part of the bicycle.The support member 101 is fixed to the shaft 123 of the front wheel by passing the Rupport member 101 through the attachment hole 102, using a nut 124. A portion represented by the numeral 106 is a cylinder having a light reflecting material on its surface. Numerals 108, 110 and 109 omitted in Fig. 18 represent wind receiving blades. Numeral 111 represents an upper disc, and numeral 112 a lower disc.Furthermore, the body of the bicycle is designated 125, a handle 126, fork blades of the front wheel 127, a front fender 128, a lamp 129, a tire 130, spokes 131, and a brake rod 132.Fig. 19 shows a further embodiment of the invention. InFig. 19, a main frame 151 is designated 151, which is shaped like a crosswise cut square pipe. The main frame 151 has an attachment member 125 on one longer side thereof. In the attachment member 152, there is formed an attachment hole 153 for attaching the revolving reflector to part of a bicycle therethrough. A rotating member is disposed inside the main frame 151. The rotating member will now be explained in reference to Fig. 19. In Fig. 19, wind receiving blades are designated 154, 155 and 156, which have light reflecting surfaces 154 , 155 and 156 cross lined portions in Fig. 19 whose positions are shifted in the axial direction of the wind receiving blades.The wind receiving blades are convex in the wind receiving direction.The upper ends and the lower ends of the wind receiving blades 154, 155, 156 are embedded in a disc 159 in which a shaft 157 is also embedded and in a disc 160 in which a shaft 158 is also embedded, respectively. The shafts 157, 158 are sharp in the other ends thereof. The thus constructed rotating member is attached to the main frame 151 in the following manner. In an upper portion of the main frame 151, there is formed a screw hole whose diameter is the same as the threads formed in an outer portion of a conic bearing 161. The conic bearing 161 is screwed in the abovementioned screw hole and is fixed to the main frame 151 by a nut 163. In a central portion of a lower portion of the main frame 151, there is disposed a conic bearing 162 in the same manner as mentioned above.Between the two bearings 161 and 162, an upper sharp shaft 157 and a lower sharp shaft 158 are inserted into the upper and lower portions of the rotating member, respectively and the rotating member is rotatably supported by the two shafts 157, 158 and the bearings 161, 162, so that the rotating member can be readily rotated by the wind.Referring to Fig. 20, the revolving reflector as shown in Fig. 19 will be explained in more detail. Fig. 20 is a section taken on line A A in Fig. 19, viewed from the direction of the arrow at the line A A. In Fig. 20, the main frame is designated 151 and 152, the wind receiving blades 154, 155 and 156, and the disc 160. In the wind receiving blade 154, a cross section of the previously mentioned light reflecting surface 154 is indicated, while in the wind receiving blade 155, a cross section of the convex wind receiving blade and an upper portion of the lower light reflecting surface. In the wind receiving blade 156, only its convex cross section is indicated. The wind receiving blades 154, 155, 156 are embedded in the disc 160 with an equal space and an equal angle therebetween radially from the center of the disc 160.The convex portions of the blades 154, 155, 156 are arranged in the same direction, namely clockwise in this embodiment.Fig. 21 shows how to attach the revolving reflector as shown in Figs. 19 and 20 to part of a bicycle. In Fig. 21, the attachment hole 153 of the main frame 151 is fitted to a shaft portion of the front wheel on its right side and is fixed thereto by a nut. As shown in Fig. 21, the axial direction of the revolving reflector is set so as to be vertical position, perpendicular to the ground, whereby the f i t r between the shafts 157, 15B having sharp ends and the conic bearings 161, 162 is reduced, so that the rotating member can be rotated by a weak wind. In the thus constructed revolving reflector, the concave sides of the wind receiving blades 154, 155, 156 are directed against the wind, so that the rotating member is rotated clockwiseIn Fig. 21, the mainframe of the revolving reflector is designated 151 and 152, the shaft of a front wheel 164, a nut of the shaft 164, spokes 165, the fork blades 166, the rim 167, the tire 168, and body of the bicycle 169.
