# Parity and syndrome generation for error and correction in digital communication systems.

## Abstract
A parity and or syndrome generator generates a block parity check for the detection and or correction of errors in a multi channel digital data communication system using a linear code or a coset of such code in which data and parity bytes are intended to be digitally encoded in n by m bit data blocks to form a respective codeword in n parallel bytes of m bits in serial order of significance in the form of a codeword having n elements represented by respective bytes in the Galois field GF 2
