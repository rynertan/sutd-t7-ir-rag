# A process for separating nitration isomers of substituted benzene compounds.

## Abstract
Mixing a nonorganic sulphide salt with a mixture of isomeric substituted nitrobenzenes, including an isomer where the nitro group is in a hindered position between two substituents and other isomers where the nitro group is not hindered, results in the selective reduction of the unhindered isomers. The substituted anilines thus formed are readily separated from the unchanged hindered substituted nitro benezene.
