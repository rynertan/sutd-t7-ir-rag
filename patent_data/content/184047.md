## Description
This invention relates to a semiconductor device comprising a gate electrode of high melting metal provided in a self alignment fashion, and, more particularly, to a super high frequency transistor and the method of manufacturing the same. When a super high frequency semiconductor device is manufactured, mask alignment should be effected with a precision of 1 µm in the formation of the various regions of a substrate and an electrode. However, the ordinary photoengraving process has the drawbacks that variations arise in the channel length and source resistance, which are parameters in defining the property of a semiconductor device, because mask alignment is carried out with low precision the device itself presents variations in its property and has a low yield and, moreover, the manufacture of said device involves complex processing. For the resolution of the above mentioned difficulties, the so called self alignment method has been proposed, this method comprising the steps of In the above mentioned proposed method, the gate electrode is prepared from a high melting metal in place of, for example, a conventional low melting metal such as aluminium. Therefore, the proposed method offers the advantages that no difficulties arise even when a gate electrode is already formed at the time of the heat treatment required to activate an ion implanted layer, said gate electrode being used in this case as a mask in ion implantation, thereby ensuring the precise formation of an impurity region. However, the proposed self alignment method is accompanied with the drawback that the high melting metal has a high resistance thus imposing limitations on the improvement of the high frequency property of an super high frequency transistor and, in fact, disallowing the attainment of any appreciable improvement. Apart from the proposed self alignment method, attempts have also been made to deposit gold on the high melting metal in order to reduce gate resistance. However, this attempt has also been accompanied with difficulties, such that, when annealing was carried out in a furnace for the activation of an ion implanted layer, the gold penetrated the high melting metal and reacted with the substrate, thus destroying the Schottky contact. Therefore, only a high melting metal having high electric resistance must be used as a gate electrode. As a result, it is difficult to provide an super high frequency transistor. JP A 57 153 475 describes a multi layer electrode on a Ga As substrate. The electrode has a first layer of tungsten, a barrier layer of tungsten nitride and a third layer of gold. The tungsten nitride layer prevents reaction between the gold and tungsten layers and between the gold layer and the Ga As substrate. It is, accordingly, an object of this invention to provide a semiconductor device which is free of the drawbacks accompanying any conventional device, and which has so low a noise level as to be suitably applied in super high frequency uses. Another object of the invention is to provide a method of manufacturing the above mentioned semiconductor device. To attain this first object, the present invention provides a semiconductor device which comprises a semiconductor device, comprising a GaAs substrate whose surface is provided with a source region, a drain region and an intervening channel region a source electrode formed on said source region a drain electrode formed on said drain region and a 3 ply gate electrode mounted on said channel region and consisting of a high melting point metal layer, a barrier metal layer and a gold layer, characterized in that said high metal melting point metal layer is formed of a material selected from the group consisting of TiW and WSi, and said barrier metal layer is formed of molybdenum. It is preferred that the high melting metal layer be prepared with a thickness ranging between 5nm 50Å and 1,000Å the barrier metal layer be prepared with a thickness ranging between 20nm 200Å and 100nm 1,000Å and the Au layer be prepared with a thickness ranging between 200nm 2,000Å and 600nm 6,000Å . The gate electrode of the semiconductor device of this invention is prepared from a high melting metal. Consequently, the source and drain regions can be very precisely formed in self alignment, with the gate electrode used as a mask, thereby ensuring the manufacture of a semiconductor device free from property variations. The gate electrode provided with a gold layer of low resistivity can be reduced in resistivity as a whole, thus making it possible to produce a field effect transistor adapted for use in high frequency applications. Since a barrier metal layer is interposed between the high melting metal layer and the gold layer, the unwanted penetration of gold through the high melting metal layer into the substrate, which might otherwise arise during annealing for the activation of ion implanted regions, resulting in reaction between the gold and the substrate, and giving rise to the destruction of the Schottky contact, is eliminated. Another embodiment of this invention provides a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device which comprises the steps of The insulating film, used in the present invention can be prepared from, for example, CVD SiO₂. It is possible to subject the insulating film to anisotropic etching prior to the ion implantation step to retain the insulating film on only the side wall of said gate electrode. It is preferred that annealing for the activation of the ion implanted region be carried out after forming an out diffusion preventing film, for example, PSG film over the entire surface of said ion implanted region. The deposition of the source and drain electrodes can be effected, for example, by the lift off method. As described above, with the method of this invention, since an impurity is implanted in the substrate to provide the source and drain regions by applying a mask consisting of the gate electrode and the insulating film deposited on the side wall of said gate electrode, the source and drain regions can be formed with high precision. Since the gate electrode is a 3 ply type consisting of a high melting metal layer, a barrier metal layer and a gold layer, the gold is prevented from penetrating through the high melting metal layer into the substrate during annealing, and the resistance of the gate electrode is reduced. Further, infrared rapid thermal annealing IRTA ensures the full activation of an impurity without a harmful affect on the gate electrode. This invention can be more fuly understood from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Description may now be made, with reference to the accompanying drawings, of a metal semiconductor field effect transistor embodying this invention. The gate electrode 1 is a 3 ply type consisting of a gold layer 2, an Mo layer 3 acting as a barrier metal layer, and a TiW layer 4 functioning as a high melting metal layer. Said gate electrode 1 is mounted on an N type channel region 5 formed on the surface of a GaAs substrate 10. Provided on both sides of said channel region 5 are a source region 6 and a drain region 7, both of N type. A source electrode 8 and a drain electrode 9 are mounted on the corresponding source region 6 and drain region 7. Description may now be made, with reference to Figs. 2A to 2F, of the sequential steps of manufacturing the subject metal semiconductor field effect transistor. A TiW layer 4 thickness, 100nm 1,000Å acting as a high melting metal layer, an Mo layer 3 thickness, 100nm 1,000Å functioning as a barrier metal, and a gold layer 2 thickness 500nm 5,000Å is formed on an N type active layer 5 to be used as a channel region which is formed on a GaAs substrate 10. The above mentioned metal layers are selectively removed by means of anisotropic etching, for example, reactive ion etching RIE , to form a gate electrode 1 on said N type active layer channel region 5. Then Fig. 2B a SiO₂ film 11 is provided with a thickness of 0.5 microns by means of plasma CVD over the entire surface of said gate electrode 1 and GaAs substrate 10. Next Fig. 2C , an anisotropic etching, for example, RIE is applied to said SiO₂ film 11, thereby causing an SiO₂ film 11a to be retained on both side walls of said gate electrode 1. Thereafter Fig. 2D , an N type impurity, for example, ₂₉Si is ion implanted in the substrate 10 with the gate electrode 1 and SiO₂ film 11a used as masks to produce N type regions 6 and 7. Thereafter Fig. 2E a cap film 12 consisting of phosphosilicate glass PSG is formed over the entire surface of the structure to suppress out diffusion. Later, annealing is applied by means of infrared ray irradiation for several to 10 seconds at a temperature of 700 to 1,000 C to activate said N type regions, thereby providing source and drain regions 6 and 7. Last Fig. 2F , those portions of said PSG film which are formed in the prescribed section of said source region 6 and drain region 7 are selectively removed. Then an Au Ge layer is mounted on the whole surface of the remaining mass. The PSG film 12 is etched off and the overlying Au Ge layer is lifted off to provide the source electrode 8 and drain electrode 9, thus finishing the subject metal semiconductor field effect transistor. Referring to the above mentioned process of manufacturing the semiconductor device, the anisotropic etching of the SiO₂ film 11 is not always required. It is possible to shift from the step of Fig. 2B in which the SiO₂ film 11 is formed on the entire surface of the fabricated structure, to the step of Fig 2D in which the N type impurity is ion implanted. In such a case, the SiO₂ film 11 has to be removed in the succeeding step. The thickness of the SiO₂ film 11 is controlled so as to prevent overlapping between the gate electrode 1 and a region defined between the source and drain regions 6 and 7, to isolate said gate electrode 1 from said intervening region. The SiO₂ film 11a retained on both side walls of the gate electrode 1 may eventually be removed or left in situ.
