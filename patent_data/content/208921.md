# HYDROFORMYLATION OF OLEFINIC COMPOUNDS IN THE PRESENCE OF A COBALT CATALYST AND AN ORGANIC NITRILE PROMOTER

## Abstract
A process is provided for the hydroformylation of an olefinic compound with carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the presence of cobalt catalyst and a promoter comprised of an organic nitrile. In one aspect, the olefinic compounds are olefinic fatty compounds with at least 4 carbon atoms. In another aspect, the cobalt catalyst consists of only a soluble cobalt salt and a promoter consisting of an organic nitrile such as acetonitrile. In another aspect of the inven tion, the olefinic compound to be hydroformylated contains a cyano substituent such that the reaction is self promoted.
