# Single and multiple sample needle assembly with vein entry indicator.

## Abstract
A single or multiple liquid sample needle assembly is provided which incorporates means for determining whether access to the sample in question has been achieved. The assembly includes a housing 12 with a receiving chamber 50 having translucent or transparent walls 88 for such determination. The invention utilizes a porous plug 27 in the chamber 50 which provides, simultaneously, a liquid barrier for the sample received, and gas displacement venting means for gas displaced by the liquid sample received. The assembly may be modified to receive only a single sample for subsequent discharge to a vacuum collec tion device, or multiple samples for sequential discharge to a plurality of vacuum collection devices. For multiple collec tion, the assembly incorporates a flexible sleeve 80 and a separate gas discharge opening 78 in combination with the sample discharge opening of the assembly.
