# Cell having mixed solid cathode materials for controlling cell expansion on discharge.

## Abstract
A galvanic cell employing a consumable anode such as lithium, a cathode that expands during cell discharge and an electrolyte, wherein the improvement is that the cathode is composed of a physical mixture of at least two solid active materials having different expansion characteristics on cell discharge and selected such that the cathode mixture has a volumetric expansion substantially equal to the volumetric contraction of the anode thereby providing a cell that will have a substantially constant physical configuration during discharge.
