# An air handling system for a paint applying enclosure.

## Abstract
An air handling system for paint spray booth 10 includes an exhaust duct 28 which delivers exhaust air to an air divider 340 . One portion of the exhaust air is fed to a vapour absorber 30 which removes organic vapour therefrom. The other portion of the exhaust air is fed to an air mixer 346 and is mixed with conditioned fresh air from a supply 348 . The mixture is then fed to the paint spray booth 10 by way of its inlet duct 14 . Since less than the entire volume of exhaust air is being stripped of organic vapour both the capital and operating costs of the vapour removal process are less than in an arrangement where all the exhaust air is treated.

## Description
AN AIR HANDLING SYSTEM FOR A PAINT APPLYING ENCLOSURE The present invention relates to an air handling system for a paint applying enclosure. Recent trends have developed two major factors in the design of industrial facilities, i.e. the increasingly stringent governmental pollution control requirements, and the cost and availability of energy.Particularly difficult problems in this regard are found in the design of paint spray booth facilities for the application of paint to automotive bodies and similar products, due to the enormous volumes of air flow required in the paint spray booths in industry. The pollution problems are associated primarily with the organic liquid constituents, including solvents, thinners and diluents of paints. Such liquid constituents are vaporised during the paint application, which vapours pass into air circulated through the booth.Such air must be circulated at relatively high volume in order to enable the paint sprayers to work in a safe, healthful and clean environment. The rigorous standards of emissions applied to industrial facilities precludes the discharge of such organic or solvent vapour laden air directly into the atmosphere, and such vapours in the discharged air are required to be reduced to very low levels. A common approach in eliminating such vapours which are combustible is to incinerate the same by passing the air into an incineration chamber which is heated by a burner to raise the temperature of the air sufficiently to cause oxidation ci, for exer p e the hydrocarbons into carbon dioxide and water vapour prior to being exhausted to the atmosphere. Hflt ver, for the enormous air flow rates exhausted from peons spray booths, the incineration process requires vast expenditures of energy, thus rendering this solution very costly to implement. other alternate approach which has been attempted and considered In this context is the use of adsorbed beds such as of activated charcoal, over which the exhaust air passed for direct adsorption of the solvent vapours, thus enabling their elimination from the exhaust air. Again, the enormous air volumes in automotive production and similar applications and the need to regenerate the adsorber beds render this approach extremely expensive. Yet another approach which has been proposed involves the replacement of the organic solvent based paint with water based paint, the elimination of vapours thus enabling direct discharge of the exhaust air to the atmosphere, after filtration or other treatment of the air to remove the paint solids. While effective in this regard, the water based paints require close control over the temperature and humidity of the air supplied to the booth, with air cooling and dehumidification during summertime, and heating and humidification during wintertime operation. This psychrometric control requires condiderable capital investment and furthermore entails considerable energy to execute. According to the present invention there is provided an air handling system for a paint applying enclosure wherein organic base paint application processes are conducted, said air handling system comprising air inlet means for introducing a flow of air into said enclosure, air exhaust means for producing a flow of exhaust air from said enclosure, vapour removal means for removing organic vapour from said exhaust air, including a supply of organic vapour absorber liquid for removing organic vapour from said exhaust air, regenerator means coupled with said vapour removal means for removing absorbed organics from said absorber liquid, and means for returning a portion of said exhaust air to said enclosure. In the system of the invention solvent stripping may be executed both on the water, after the filtration and removal of the paint solids, and also on the exhaust air after it has passed through the water scrubbing system to remove the paint solids. A portion of the exhaust air is returned to the spray booth either before or after it is stripped of solvent vapours. In an embodiment, a portion of the water is also returned to the spray booth before it is stripped of solvent vapours. Embodiments of the present invention will hereinafter be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which FIGURE 1 is a diagrammatic representation of a paint application facility including a system for eliminating paint solvent vapours from both air and water, FI RE 2 is adiagrammatic representation of a paint application facility incorporating a system for elim1.nPting paint solvent vapours from the air only, FICLTR. 3 is n longitudinal view of an absorption unit associated with the system depicted in FIGURE 2, parts being broken away in section for clarity, FYf TRE 4 is a sectional view taken along the line 4 4 in FIGURE 5, FIC5US 5 Is a plan view of the regenerator unit shown in FIGURES 3 and 4, FIGURE 6A is a perspective view together with a phantom representation of a spray header withdrawal from the absorption unit depicted in FIGURES 3 5, FIGURE 6B is a reverse perspective view of the absorption unit shown in FIGURE 6A with a phantom representation of a coalescer pad lRiithdrz al, FIGURE 7 is an air entry view of a typical coalescer pad stage, FIGURE 8 is a side view of a typical coalescer and associated drain structure, FIGURE 9 is an enlarged detailed view depicting the area 8 of FIGURE 8, FIGURE 10 is an enlarged detailed view depicting the area 9 of FIGURE 11, FIGURE 11 is a plan view of a typical channel support for the coalescer pad, FIGURE 12 is a perspective view of an alternate form of an absorber unit which may be employed in the system shown in FIGURES 1 or 2, FIGURE 13 is a diagrammatic view of an embodiment of the paint application facilities shown in FIGURES 1 and 2 incorporating an air handling system of the present invention, and FIGURE 14 shows a further embodiment of an air handling system of the present invention. The system described herein has particular application to a paint spray booth of the type including the use of a water flooded floor beneath the paint spray area in which the paint spray operations are conducted and in which the paint and solvent laden air is drawn down through the floor grills and exits through particulate scrubbing means beneath the grilled floor of the spray booth working area. The air and water passing with great turbulence and intimate contact through the tubes causes the solids in the paint, i.e., the pigments, resin and other components, to be removed from the air and become suspended within the water flow. Such an arrangement is disclosed in UOSO Patent No. 3,421,293. In order to remove the paint solids from the circulated treatment water, arrangements have been provided for collecting the paint solids and removing them from the water flow, as by causing them to raft on the surface of a collecting tank. Such an arrangement is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,100,066. The particular composition in paint used in automotive production and similar processes varies with the particular requirements and with the particular manufacturer of the paint. However, a number of organic liquids are usually included, as solvents, thinners and diluents, some of which are typically soluble in water and others of which are not. Accordingly, in passing with the water in intimate contact therewith, the air exhausted from the spray booth tends to cause a proportion of the solvent vapours contained in the exhaust air to go intc sW ion with the circulated treatment water. The remaining Thy rcphcbic vapours pass out with the exhaust air. Thus if the composition of the paint is such that G significant proportion of the liquid constituents are water soluble, such water flow treatment utilized in the spray booth air exhaust system itself represents means for partially eliminating the organic vapours. On the other hai , the recirculated water cannot continue indefinitely to pick up the organic compounds and soon becomes saturated with them, and some means must be provided for their continuous removal from the circulated water. FIGURE 1 shows an example of a paint application facility including a paint spray booth 10, comprising an enclosure within which an auto body shell 12 or other cumpo nent is painted during production. The air supplied for ventilation is received via ducting 14 and caused to be circulated by means of a supply blower 16. A wintertime heat exchanger 17 is provided, for purposes to be described, and the inlet duct 19 receives fresh air from the building exterior. The air passes through a grill 18 disposed across the floor of the paint spray booth 10 and thence over a flooded subfloor 20 which receives water flow via supply line 22. The water over the subfloor 22 tends to partially collect the overspray during paint spraying operations, which settles into the water. The air with the balance of overspray, partially fine particles and solvent vapours, is circulated out through longitudinally spaced outlet tubes 24 through which the water from the floor 20 flows.An intense scrubbing action of the air occurs in the tubes and the paint is transferred to the water which flows into a collecting pan 26. The exhausted air, after passing through the outlet tubes 24 and having the paint solids thereby substantially removed, passes out through an exhaust duct indicated at 28 and thence passes through an exhaust air organic vapour absorber unit or stripper 30, which will be described hereinafter in further detail, and is then directed by an exhaust blower 32 to an outside stack 34. A heat exchanger 36 is also provided, for purposes to be described. The water entraining the paint solids and having a proportion of solvents dissolved therein passes into collecting flumes 38 from which it is withdrawn through lines 40 and 42 to be directed to a paint solid removing apparatus 44. This apparatus 44 may be of the type described inuthe above mentioned U.S.Patent No. 4,100,066 comprises a first collecting chamber 46 which receives the paint solid containing water and causes collecting of the paint solids which are periodically removed. A level control tank 48 is also provided which causes the water to be regulated in the interior of the removing apparatus 44 in order to maintain the appropriate levels to conduct the removal process. A return line 50 recirculates the water via pump 52 onto the spray booth subfloor to enable continuous execution of the process. Thus, the air exhausted thrC b The exhaust duct 28 is substantially free from paint solids but does contain those organic solvent vap which have not gone into solution with the wat r SInilar y the water in level control tank 48, while having the solids substantially removed therefrom, still contains the solvents in solution. The solvent must be continuously removed is the water is not to become saturated. Also integrated nnto the system illustrated is a paint curing oven 54 in which air is heated and passed to maintain the temperature at a suitable high level for proper paint drying and curing. The air is withdrawn into a ceiling duct 56 and thence in part circulated through a fume incinerator 58. An exhaust blower 60 is provided to draw air upwardly through louvres 62 of the ceiling duct 56 and hence through an exhaust duct 64. A proportion of the exhaust flow is recirculated by a supply fan 66 and a plenum 68 into the interior of the paint curing oven 54. A portion of the exhaust flow is drawn off by the exhaust blower 60, and passed through an air to air heat exchanger 70 where it is preheated by incinerated air exiting from an incinerator chamber 72. The preheated air enters the inlet 126 of the incinerator chamber 72 via duct 128. After passing through the incinerator chamber 72, a portion of the incinerated air is received by the inlet of supply fan 66 through duct 74. The incinerator design is of a type as shown in U.S. Patent No. 3,917,444. A second air to air heat exchanger 76 provides an exchange of heat between fresh, make up air introduced through ducting 78 and the remaining incinerated air flow vented to the atmosphere through vent 80. The illustrated system is arranged to remove solvent from the exhausted air after passing into the exhaust duct 28 and also to remove the solvents from the water after solids removal in apparatus 44 and entry into the level control tank 48. As mentioned previously, the elimination of vapours from the air is achieved in an absorption type air stripper 30 indicated in which absorbing liquid is circulated via pump 82 through a bank of spray nozzles 84. The liquid may comprise an oil or oil base derivative or any other substance having an affinity for organic solvents. The air passes through a matrix 86 which is sprayed with the liquid absorbent. The matrix 86 initially facilitates the development of a very large liquid absorbing surface to which the organic solvent vapours are attracted. Subsequently, it causes the now solvent laden liquid to coalesce into larger droplets which may be separated from the air stream by gravity or as hereafter described. After passing through the coalescing matrix 86, a series of baffles 88 cause the now larger sized absorber liquid droplets to be eliminated from the air stream, collected in a collecting compartment 89 to enable the liquid to be directed to the return side of the circulation pump 82. The air thence is dire te to a vent by exhaust blower 32 as indicated previously. Analternative absorbing unit is des cribbed Yiereinbelcw. Since a given quantity of absorbing liquid cannot absorb the solvent vapours indefinitely, regeneration apparatus is provided through which a portion of the absorbing liquid is circulated. In the regeneration process, the heat required to drive off the solvent in the absorbing liquid is modest since the volume and specific heat of absorbing liquid is relatively low compared to other absorbing media. The regeneration apparatus includes a lquid ,o liquid heat exchanger 94. Tc maximize the efficiency of the regeneration process, the regeneratlon apparatus is integrated with the fume incinerator 58 which is associated with the paint curing over 54. The solvent laden absorbing liquid is fed through the heat exchanger 94 and then through supply line 96 to a series of nozzles 98 arranged above high temperature heating coils 100. The nozzles 98 spray the liquid over the heating coils 100. The heating coils receive incinerated air from the vent 80. This incinerated air has passed from the incinerator chamber 72 and through the air to air heat exchangers 70 and 76. Thus, the heat of the incinerator is partially recovered to be utilized for regeneration heat. A recirculating pump 102 causes recirculation of the regenerated absorbing liquid back to the supply side of the pump 82. The absorbing liquid is heated and purged of solvents by contact with the hot surfaces of the heat ing coil 100 and releases the solvent vapours. These vapours are then condensed in a condensing chamber 104 by contact with a cooling coil 106 disposed in a collection compartment 107. The cooling coil 106 receives a flow of chilled liquid via line 108 which is connected to the expansion side 110 of a mechanical refrigeration unit generally indicated at 112. Collection compartment 107 is provided with a drain line 114 communicating with a solvent recovery tank 116. Condensing chamber 104 is maintained at a relatively low pressure to maximize vaporization of solvents out of the absorbing liquid. The condensing chamber 104 is preferably put under a partial vacuum by means of a vacuum pump 118 having an inlet line 120 including the pressure responsive valve 122, which regulates the pressure maintained in the condensing chamber 104. The vacuum pump 118 has an outlet 124 which communicates with the inlet 126 of the incinerator chamber 72 such that the organic vapours pass into the incinerator chamber 72 and are incinerated together with the vapour carrying air received from the outlet side of the airto air heat exchanger 70. It will be appreciated that the system illustrated in Figure 1 achieves removal of the organic vapours from the spray booth exhaust air with high efficiency. The regenerator apparatus itself is highly efficient as it utilizes both the liquid to liquid heat exchanger 94 and the otherwise waste heat generated by the fume incinerator 58. As indicated above, the system includes vacuum distillation means for removing solvent from the cir culated water A vacuum is applied above the water as it irculates so as to cause the direct vaporization of the organic compounds. The water is elevated approx mately 9 metres to a condensing chamber to enable a low vapour pressure to be maintained in the chamber. The chamber is continuously purged to remove non condensable gases such as air and the relatively low pressure facilitates the vaporization of the solvents and thus removal from the circulated water without heating of the water mass itself. The pressure reduction over the top of the water is achieved by means of an outer standpipe 130 of relatively large diameter, the lower end of which extends into level control tank 48. Within the Interior of the large diameter outer standpipe 130 is a relatively smaller diameter inner standpipe 132 with a clearance space therebetween enabling the water to flow up the outer standpipe 130 and down the inner standpipe 132. The large diameter outer sbandpepe 130 is of greater height than the inner standpipe 132 as illustrated, such that the water is contained therein as it passes into the interior of the inner standpipe 132 while flowing exposed to the inerior of the condensing chamber 134. The condensing chamber 134 is connected via pressure regulation valve 140, branch connection 138 and line 136 to the vacuum pump 118 and is evacuated thereby.The pressure maintained in the chamber 134 is somewhat less than the vapour pressure of the water flowing through the standpipes 130 and 132. The height of the standpipes 130 and 132 is selected to relate to the vacuum imposed on the condensing chamber 134, i.e., full vacuum of the corresponding pressure head would be approximately 98.6 KPa 33 feet of water such that the water will be subjected to the low vacuum without causing it to be drawn into the interior of the condensing chamber 134. This relatively low pressure in condensing chamber 134 produces a greatly enhanced tendency for the dissolved organics to vaporize, while the water, having much less tendency to vaporize, will flush off in the condensing chamber 134 to a much lesser extent so as to be present in relatively inconsequential quantities. The organic vapours are condensed by cooling coils 142 supplied with cooled heat transfer medium flowing via line 150 and which are disposed in the condensing chamber 134 to cause the vapour to be condensed into liquid form and collected in the compartment 144. The collected liquid passes into drain line 146 and to a recovery vessel 148. The continuous purging of the interior of the condensing chamber 134 via line 136 insures the removal of non condensable gases and the maintenance of the relatively low pressure at which the organic solvents freely evaporate out of the water. The liquid level control tank 48 may also have a slight vacuum applied to the region above the water level by a condensing chamber 152 provided with a vent tube 154. A connection drain line 156 connects the chamber 152 to the recovery tank 148. A branch line including a pressure control valve 158 connects the ch ffl er 152 to the vacuum pump 118. A cooling coil 152 f provIded in the condensing chamber 152 and is supplied with a llow of cooled heat transfer medium via 7 150. A relatively slight vacuum is applied to the condensing chamber 152 to enable the free flow of water into and out of the level control tank 48 while collecting the solvent vapours which may accumulate above the water level in condensing chamber 152. The vacuum is set by the pressure control valve 158. In order to maximize the efficiency of the use of the refrigeration unit 112, the heat exchanger 36 receives a flow of the heat transfer medium which is circulated through condenser tubes of a condenser 160 of the unit 112. This acts to dissipate heat transferred from the evaporator 110 by operation of a compressor 162 of the unit 112. The heat to the evaporator originates from the heat of condensation of the solvent vapours in the respective condensing chambers 104, 134, and 152. The heat exchanger 36 rejects the heat into the exhaust air which is relatively cool during summer conditions. During winter conditions, the heat is transferred via the heat exchanger unit 17 to prewarm the incoming air and thus enhance the efficiency of the process. Attention is now directed to FIGURE 2 which illustrates an alternate paint application facility which is similar in many respects to that previously described.The system of FIGURE 2 includes a paint spray booth 164 having an air supply system generally indicated at 166 that causes conditioned air to be entered into an upper plenum space 168 through a diffuser ceiling layer 170, before passing into the working area 172 of the booth. The air is exhausted through an exhaust ducting 174 after passing through a paint solids removal system which preferably takes the form of a water washed series of tubes similar to that previously described with reference to FIGURE 1. In this system, a series of exit tubes 176 pass out through the bottom of the floor 178 which is flooded with water and has a weir overflow not shown causing an outflow of water through the exit tubes 176. Flow through the exit tubes 176 causes a thorough washing of the extract air passing out through a below floor space 180 in communication with the exhaust ducting 174. Accordingly, the exhaust ducting 174 receives air which has been substantially completely freed of overspray paint solids but which contains a solvent vapour typically at 220 and 400 parts per million. While this constitutes a relatively dilute proportion of solvent vapours, the concentration is still too high to simply be discharged to the atmosphere without potentially running afoul of pollution control standards. An air exhaust fan 182 directs the exhaust flow through a multi stage absorber unit 184 whereat the solvent vapours are absorbed prior to the air being passed through an exhaust stack 186. Such absorber unit 184 is typically of a special design as will be described hereinafter and essentially provides a contact of the air exhaust flow with a flowing film of solvent absorber Pfqtrid such as oil over which the air passes.The liquid is caused to be regenerated such that there is an inflow of relatively solvent free liquid received over a supply line 188 and a collection of solvent laden liquid over return line 190. The supply and return lines 188 and 190 respectively, are in communication with the installation tank, pump end filter means generally indicated at 192, including a collection tank, liquid circulating pumps and filtration units the latter remove the minor quantities of paint solids which may accumulate in the liquid which result from the small quantity of paint solids still present after the water scrubbing op era tion in the paint spray booth 164. After such filtration, the solvent laden liquid is circulated via line 194 to a heat exchai ei 196. The heat exchanger 196 comprises a preheatlng means for the liquid contained in line 194 by a heat exchange relationship with the relatively hot liquid returning from a distillatic,n column 198 in line 200, such that the relatively hot solvent free liquid causes an elevation in the temperature of the solvent laden liquid in line 200. The returning liquid, even after passing through the heat exchanger 196 while at a relatively reduced temperature in line 204 is still at an elevated temperature, i.e., of the order of 1380C. The preheated liquid in line 202 is circulated through an incinerator heat exchanger 206. The heat exchanger 206 is associated with an exhaust paint drying oven 208 in which solvent laden air is exhausted through ducting 210 and passes through an incinerator section generally indicated at 212. The solvent vapours are incinerated such that a relatively hot solvent free exhaust gas may be exhausted through an exhaust stack indicated at 214. Such incinerator system may be similar to that previously described with reference to FIGURE 1. This represents a clean source of heat which is employed to further heat the already preheated liquid flow in line 202 to a temperature at which a distillation regeneration process may be conducted. Liquid in line 216 after passing through the second heat exchanger 206 is heated to a relatively elevated temperature level, i.e., typically of the order of 2490C. The heated solvent laden liquid in line 216 enters the distillation column 198 at the upper reaches thereof and passes downwardly through trays disposed therein while giving up the solvent content by vaporization of the solvent content. The distillation column 198 may be of conventional known construction per se, as employed in various distillation processes in the oil refining industries. Preferably, the operation of the distillation column 198 is under a partial vacuum, for example, 88 KPa, in order to enable distillation to proceed at relatively modest temperatures, i.e., such as the aforementioned 2490C For this plir flse, a vacuum pump 218 is employed having Inlet line 220 supplied to the lowest pressure area of the distillation column 198. The vacuum pump 218 also withdraws vapours from solvent condenser 224 and a condenser 226 such that the exhaust in vacuum pump 218 contains solvent and liquid vapours RTI ID 18.13 which are routed Into the incinerator section 212 as shown to burn these vapours to allow exhaust into the atmosphere of the outflow from the vacuum pump 218. The solvent vapours formed in the interior of the distillation column 198 are withdrawn to be collected in the solvent condenser 224 and with a collector line 232 leading to a solvent location facility. Any absorber liquid vapours which are formed are connected in the condenser 226, being withdrawn at a lower ele vation in the distillation column 198. Any condensed absorbent liquid vapours are returned via line 234 to the Installation tSt, pump and filter means 192 for recirculation to the absorber unit 184. The hot solvent free unvapourized liquid removed from the lower section of the distillation column 198 in line 200 is passed through the heat exchanger 196 where it is cooled to 138 C. In order to recover the heat energy in the liquid at about 1380C in return line 204, the liquid is circulated through a line 236 to a heat recovery means comprised of a series of air to liquid heat exchangers 238 as shown. The heat energy is thus utilized in the air supply system 166 in which the incoming air and ducting 240 are heated by passing through the air to liquid heat exchanger 238. A series of such heat exchangers 238 are provided and each may be used to heat the air supplied to different spray booth sections. Alternatively, the heat exchangers may be employed for supplying the heat for other low grade heat using processes, such as to heating of the water and phosphate solution in the pretreatment plant to the relatively modest temperatures required, for example, about 710C. The liquid is cooled in return line 242 to the installation tank, pump and filter means 192 which then circulates the now cool, for example, 18 C, solvent free liquid to the supply line 188 and thus enables continuous regeneration of the liquid to remove the solvent picked up in the booth exhaust air. The constructional details of the absorber unit 184 itself are illustrated in FIGURES 3 to 11. The absorber unit 184 includes a sheet metal housing 244 having an inlet opening 246 at one end receiving ducting 248 connected to the exhaust from the air exhaust fan 182. Outlet openings 250 are connected to a cross ducting vent stack 252 with a plenum transition 254. Suitable fire doors 256 and 258 are provided for closing off the absorber unit with a fusible link mechanism not shown enabling a closing off of the absorber unit in a manner known in the art. The absorber unit 184 is of a multi stage construction and it has been found that successive independent stages of air to liquid contact provide the very effective control or reduction of the solvent vapour content ci the air such as to enable relatively complete solvent removal i.e., 80 solvent content removed after passIng therethrough. Each stage consists of a coalescer pad assembly 260 which is sprayed with an absorber liquid such as oil. A final coalescer pad assembly 262 is provided at the exit end to remove any liq id droplets contained in the exhausting air. Each of the coalescer pad assemblies 260 and 262 consists of an array of pad assemblies 264, 266, 268 o6 nd270 disposed to extend transversely across the interior of the sheet metal housing 244 so as to cause the entire flow to be intercepted in passing through the ccalescer pad sections. Each of the coalescer pad sections 264, 266, 258 and 270 includes an outer mesh 272 on either side of the pad 274 of knitted filament material, which may be either metal or plastics material. This material is of the type commercially available and is known as type H or equivalent, manufactured by Begg, Cousland Co.,Ltd. of the United Kingdom and is of a similar material to that employed in scouring pads. Each of the coalescer pad sections 264, 266, 268 and 270 is disposed in a surrounding channel frame indicated at 276 consisting of bottom and top channels 278 and 280, and side channels 282 and 284 welded together to form the framework. The bottom and top channels 278 and 280 are joined with a deflector section 286 forming a V shape transition into the coalescer pad sections such as to deflect the air flow smoothly into the coalescer pad sections. A drain tray 287 is disposed at the bottom of each pad section 264 270, on the air exit side thereof which captures absorbing fluid droplets that are drawn through the pad section and pass downwardly by gravity. The bottom and top channels 278 and 280 are perforated as may be seen in FIGURE 11 and perforated with holes 288 in order to enable drainage of the liquid from each of the coalescer pad sections 264, 266, 268 and 270. The coalescer pads are retained at their outer edges with a suitable channel frame indicated at 290, the bottom of which is also perforated for this same purpose. Each of the coalescer pads is fitted with an endcap 294 to which is bolted a suitable handle 296 provided to the outer channel frame 290 for this purpose. As noted, each of the coalescer pad assemblies 260 is adapted to be sprayed with an absorber liquid such as oil in order to provide the saturation of the pad and enable the pad to be thoroughly wet with the absorber liquid to thus provide an intimate contact with the air flow through each of the pads. A suitable arrangement is provided by a circulation pump 298 receiving inlet supply tube 300 positioned in a sump pan 302 positioned to be adapted to receive all of the drainage from each of the coalescer pad assemblies 260 via a collector pan 304 and a series of down tubes 3C6. The inclination of the collector pan 304 is such as to provide a selfscouring action to preclude accumulation of solids. The output Of the circulation pump 298 is connected with a header pipe 308 in turn in communication with a series of spray nozzle pipes 310 entering each of the housing stages immediately upstream of a respective coalescer pad having a plurality of nozzle openings 312 adapted to direct a spray of absorber liquid at each of the coalescer pad sections 264, 266, 268 and 270 to thoroughly wet these surfaces. The collecting solvent laden liquid in the sump pan 302 is connected to the supply and return lines via openings 313 and 314, respectively, for continuous removal of the solvent content. A series of access doors 316 are also provided which enable entry for cleanout and other maintenance purposes to each of the stages. It has been found that this multi stage approach operates efficiently to remove the solvent vapours to appropriate low levels in a relatively lightweight, simple and inexpensive construction, Is highly reliable in operation and accordingly it is very well suited to automotive paint spraying installation applications. Attention is now directed to FIGURE 12 wherein an alternate form of an absorber unit is depicted which may be advantageously employed with either of the systems shown in FIGURES 1 or 2. The alternate form of the absorber unit, generally indicated by the numeral 318, includes spray means 320, baffle means 322, coalescing means 324 aid eliminator means 326. The spray means 320 preferably comprises a distribution tube connected to a source of absorber liquid and having a plurality of longitudinally spaced apertures 328 therein, preferably helically disposed about the longitudinal axis of the spray means 320. Baffle means 322 comprises an inner cylindricallyspaced wall 330 having a plurality of perforations 334 therein and radially spaced from the spray means 320. Baffle means 322 further comprises an outer cylindrically shaped wall 332 radially spaced from the inner wall 330 to define a longitudinally extending annular chamber 336 which is open at the outer end thereof. Coalescing means 324 comprises a pervious pad of material, preferably formed of metal, disposed at the outer end of baffle means 332 and in communication with the chamber 336. Coalescing means 324 is adapted to allow the passage of gas therethrough, but contacts and thereby coalesces finely atomized droplets of fluid suspende d in such gas. The Eiminator means 326 is of a construction well known in the art and is disposed at the downstream end of coalescing means 324. In operation, the absorber unit 318 is positioned in the corresponding air stripper such that the chamber 336 is disposed toward the oncoming air flow. Solvent absorbing liquid discharged from the spray means discharge tube 320 emanates radially from the tube at relatively high velocity, and perpendicular to the air flow. Ee absorbing liquid entering the volume of space between the tube, 320 and inner wall 330 becomes partiali7 atomized in the air flow. Due to the high velocity and positioning of the jets of absorbing liquid, the central core of the air flow inside inner wall 330 is di ected to impinge on the surface of the inner wall 330 adjacent the tube 320.The partially atomized mixture of fluid and air spreads upon impact over the surface of the inner wall 330 and eventually enters the perforatIons 334. Air entering the chamber 336 and flowing over the perforations 334 acts to shear the atomized mixture of fluid and air passing radially outward through the perforations 334 thereby increasing the atomizeing and mixing effect. The finely atomized mixture of fluid and air enters the coalescing means 324 which converts the mixture into larger droplets which then are drain by the air flow into the eliminator means 326. Eliminator means 326 collects these larger droplets of the mixture and draws the collected, solvent laden liquid away from the absorber unit 318, as by gravity.It is to be noted that the particular dimensions of the various components of the absorber unit, e.g. the radius of the inner wall 330 and outer wall 332, will be governed by the particular application and type of absorbing liquid employed. It is also to be noted that both the baffle means 322 and coalescing means 324 may be rectangular in cross section if desired. Moreover, although a single baffle is depicted in the drawings, a plurality of concentrically disposed baffles may be employed if desired. With the present trend toward automated paint application, it is apparent that somewhat higher levels of organic vapour in paint application booths can be tolerated compared to hand application by humans which is governed by rigid environmental regulations.The overall costs of organic vapour removal may be substantially reduced where higher levels of the vapour can be tolerated by employing the paint application facility which is depicted in FIGURE 13. The exhaust air exiting from the spray booth 10 in exhaust duct 28 is delivered to an air divider 340 which diverts one portion of the exhaust air via duct 354 to the vapour absorber 30 and the remaining portion to an air mixer 346. The vapour free exhaust air issuing from the vapour absorber 30 may be delivered by duct 356 through a heat exchanger as previously described and then exhausted or used in other processes. Divider 340 and mixer 346 may comprise conventional variable valve type chambers to permit selection of the proportions of air to be mixed or divided. Make up fresh air from a supply 348 is passed through an air conditioner 350 and is delivered to the mixer 346 where it is combined with the exhaust air from booth 10. The outflow from mixer 346 is coupled with inlet duct 14 such that a portion of the exhaust air from the booth 10 having organic vapour therein is mixed with fresh make up air and is returned for use in the booth 10. Since less than the entire volume of exhaust air is being stripped of organic vapour, it is apparent that an absorber 30 of somewhat smaller capacity may be employed thereby reducing both capital and operating costs of the vapour removal process. Moreover, the operating efficiency of the vapour absorber 30 is notably increased by virtue of the higher concentration of organic vapour in the exhaust air. The overall recirculation concept described immediately above may also be applied to the removal of solvents in the solvent water scrubber portion of the system. For example, as shown in FIGURES 13 and 14, after removal of paint solids in the removing apparatus 44, portions of the solvent laden water are directed to the solvent removal apparatus generally indicated at 351 and to the return line 50 via line 353. Again, this arrangement reduces capital and operatirgcosts since only a portion of the water exiting booth 10 need be processed for solvent removal, and the portion which is so processed contains a higher concentration of solvents compared to the system shown in FIGURES 1 and 2 in which the entire volume of water is processed by the removal apparatus 351. A further embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIGURE 14 in which a portion of the air exhausted from the spray booth 10 is recirculated back to the booth 10. In this embodiment, entire volume of exhaust air delivered via conduit 28 is processed by the vapour absorber 30 and is then routed to the air divider 340 by a conduit 338. A portion of vapour free exhaust air is delivered to an exhaust by conduit 342, the remaining portion being routed by conduit 344 to the air mixer 346 where it is combined with fresh make up as previously described. Thus, the entire volume of air supplied to the booth 10 by inlet duct 14 is substantially vapour free.
