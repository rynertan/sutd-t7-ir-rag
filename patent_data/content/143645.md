## Description
OPTICAL FILTERS DESCRIPTION This invention relates to optical filters, and more particularly to optical filters for optical communications systems It has been known for some time that gaps, such as may occur, for example, in optical fibre connectors between the ends of two adjoining optical fibres result in transmission losses which persist even though the fibres are in accurate axial alignment, and which are caused by optical interference effects Several workers have investigated these interference effects with a view to minimising the accompanying losses cf, for example, R E Wagner and C,R, Sandahl, Interference effects in optical fibre connections , Applied Optics, Vol 21, No 8, pp 1381 1385 , or with a view to using the interference effects for measuring the gap between the fibre endsThus, for example, it was observed by R.E Wagner and C R. Sandahl op cit that losses due to interference varied with fibre end separation, and that the losses could be eliminated by bringing the fibre ends into intimate contact The present invention is based on our appreciation that interference effects due to a gap at the end of an optical fibre can be turned to advantage, in that if the gap at the end of the fibre is formed between two sufficiently reflective surfaces and has the appropriate dimensions, it defines a wavelength selective Fabry Perot cavity which can be employed to form comparatively simple yet effective optical filters for optical communications systems Thus, according to the present invention there is provided an optical filter in which an end face of an optical fibre, treated to have increased reflectivity, is spaced from a reflective surface to define a cavity which transmits only a particular wavelength or narrow range of wavelengths In order to achieve the wavelength selectivity required for optical communications systems, e g, for purposes of demultiplexing wavelength division multiplexed optical signals, the fibre needs to be a single mode fibre Said reflective surface may be provided preferably on the end face of a further optical fibre, this further fibre being a multimode optical fibre In another preferred form of the present invention the reflective surface may be provided on a reflective transparent plate such as, for example, a glass plate In order to obtain the required reflectivity, the fibre end face and or the reflective surface will typically have a suitable coating of metal or dielectric material applied thereto The optical path length of the cavity may be made variable to provide a tunable optical filter The optical path length of the cavity may be variable, for example, by varying the spacing between the fibre end face and the reflective surface Thus, the aforementioned multimode fibre may, for example, be mounted in a piezo electric element which can be employed to vary the axial position of the multimode fibre Instead of varying the optical path length by varying mechanically the length of the cavity, the path length may be varied electro optically, for example A photodetector may be arranged to receive light transmitted through the cavity The monomode fibre may be mounted in a sleeve comprising shape memory effect SME metal The optical filter according to the invention may be arranged to select a particular wavelength or band of wavelengths from a range of wavelengths being transmitted along the said fibre The invention will be described now by way of example only with particular reference to the accompanying drawings of which Figure 1 is a schematic side sectional view of an optical fibre to fibre filter in accordance with the present invention Figure 2 is a graph illustrating the transmission characteristics of the filter of Figure 1 and Figure 3 is a schematic diagram of another embodiment of the present invention employing a reflective plate An optical fibre connector for joining two optical fibres in axial alignment comprises a cylindrical housing 10 The cylindrical housing 10 has a through bore having a relatively small diameter first portion 11, a relatively large diameter second portion 12 and an intermediate diameter third portion 14 A sleeve 15 made from shape memory effect SME material fits tightly within the bore 14 The end of a monomode optical fibre 16 which is located within a ferrule connector 17, fits tightly within the sleeve 15 The bore portion 12 accommodates a tubular piezoelectric device 18 within which is located part of a connector ferrule 19 The connector ferrule 19 is located at the end of a multimode fibre 20 and extends into the bore of the sleeve 15 terminating a small distance from the end of the ferrule 17 The ferrule 19 is a sliding fit within the tube 15 The end of the optical fibre 16 and the end of the optical fibre 20 have each been coated with a coating which is highly reflective at a wavelength of 1 3 M The spacing between the fibre ends is selected so that aFabry Perot cavity 21 is defined therebetween whereby that cavity acts as a wavelength selective filter to transmit only a particular narrow range of the wavelengths being transmitted along the monomode fibre 16 The position of the end of the fibre relative to that of the fibre 16 can be adjusted by actuating the piezoelectric device 18 to move the ferrule 19 in an axial direction In this way the size of the cavity 21 can be varied to adjust the wavelength transmitted by the cavity Typically the spacing between the fibre end faces is of the order of one to several times the wavelength of the optical signals transmitted along the optical fibres Figure 2 illustrates a typical spectral response for transmitted light propagated along the receiving fibre 20 In the embodiment of Figure 3 the optical filter is provided by a Fabry Perot cavity 30 which is defined between the end face of an optical fibre 11 and a glass plate 32. The end face of the fibre 11 and the face 34 of the plate are each coated with a coating which is highly reflective in the wavelength range to be scanned by the filter, typically in the region of 1 3 mx A photodetector 35 is positioned to receive light transmitted through the filter The size of the cavity 30 is carefully selected so that it transmits a particular wavelength or narrow range of wavelengths It will be appreciated that the Figure 3 is a schematic representation only of an optical filterThe optical fibre end will be carried in a termination, for example, one similar to that ofFigure 1, which will itself be mounted in a precision mounting eg a connector ferrule Similarly, the glass plate will be mounted in a precision mountingPreferably either or both of the mountings will be such as to permit axial movement of the fibre end face and or glass plate This arrangement allows the cavity size to be varied so that the wavelength of the transmitted light can be adjusted The arrangement shown in the Figure could be modified by replacing the photodetector by another optical fibre A number of applications are envisaged for the optical filters in accordance with the present invention They could be used, for example, as demultiplexers in wavelength multiplexed optical transmission systems In such a system, information is transmitted along optical fibres at a plurality of specific wavelengths A subscriber can select the information which he requires to receive by tuning his filter to transmit the wavelength associated with the required information
