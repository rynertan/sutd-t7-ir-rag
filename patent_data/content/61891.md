# Catalysts and their production.

## Abstract
A catalyst support can be made by co precipitating copper aluminate from a solution containing copper and aluminium ions and converting the precipitate into solid, generally particulate, form. The catalyst preferably includes a redox couple and may include promoters. The catalyst is of particular value for the low temperature oxidisation of carbon monoxide, especially in a smoking product filter.
