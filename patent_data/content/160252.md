## Description
This invention relates to novel antibacterial compounds having excellent antibacterial action, a method of preparing same and a pharmaceutical composition. A variety of cephem compounds having a quaternary ammoniomethyl group at the 3 position and 2 2 aminothiazol 4 yl 2 hydroxy or substituted hydroxy iminoacetamido group at the 7 position simultaneously or derivatives thereof have so far been synthesized, and patent applications for instance, Japanese Publication of Unexamined Application Kokai Sho 53 34795, Sho 54 9296, Sho 54 135792, Sho 54 154786, Sho 55 149289, Sho 57 56485, Sho 57 192394, Sho 58 159498, etc. concerning those compounds have been filed. However, most of the compounds, whose quaternary ammoniomethyl group at the 3 position has a nitrogen containing aromatic heterocyclic ring, are those having a monocyclic pyridinium group with or without a substituent or substituents on the ring thereof, and the compounds of the present invention having an imidazol 1 yl group which forms a condensed ring at the 2,3 position or the 3,4 position have never been disclosed in the specification of any patent application, not to speak of a report of the synthesis thereof. Furthermore EP 0 062 321 discloses cephem compounds and US 4 165 430 discloses cephalosporin compounds. Cephem type antibiotics have been widely used for the therapy of diseases of human beings and animals caused by pathogenic bacteria. These compounds are especially useful for the therapy of diseases caused by bacteria resistant to penicillin type antibiotics as well as for the therapy of penicillin sensitive patients. In these cases, it is desirable to use cephem type antibiotics showing activity against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria. For this reason, extensive studies on cephem type antibiotics having a wide antibacterial spectrum have been carried out. As a result of research work covering a long period of time, it has been found that introduction of 2 2 aminothiazol 4 yl 2 hydroxy or substituted hydroxy iminoacetamido group or nitrogen containing heterocycle amino group at the 7 position of cephem ring renders the cephem compound active against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria, which has led to the exploitation and development of what is called the third generation cephalosporin . At present, several types of the third generation cephalosporin compounds have already been put on the market. Another characteristic feature of these third generation cephalosporin antibiotics lies in that these substances are active against the so called cephalosporin resistant bacteria, which penicillins have also encountered.
