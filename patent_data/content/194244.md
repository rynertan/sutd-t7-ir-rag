# Test apparatus in a radar system.

## Abstract
A test apparatus for the reception channels, e.g. in a doppler radar system with electrically controlled aerial ele ments A1 An . Behind each aerial element there are optical detectors O1 On arranged for receiving an optical signal from the system transmitter and converting it to an RF signal. The latter is sent to the transmitter receiver modules M1 Mn of the system and further to a detection measurement unit 3 . The measurement unit evaluates the different mod ules M1 Mn with relation to amplitude and phase of the test signal, and sends correction signals to the modules in res ponse to the evaluation. The apparatus can also be utilized for testing the system transmission channels.
