# Acrylic dimerization using supported catalysts.

## Abstract
A process for dimerizing acrylonitrile to produce adiponitrile and or 1,4 dicyanobutenes comprises contact ing acrylonitrile with a catalyst at a temperature of 20 to 250 C in the presence of hydrogen, said catalyst compris ing a polymer support having a ruthenium complex bonded thereto, said polymer support comprising an organic poly mer backbone having trivalent pendant atoms selected from P, As, Sb, Bi and N covalently bonded thereto and randomly distributed in said polymer, said ruthenium complex being capable of catalyzing the dimerization of acrylonitrile to adiponitrile and or 1,4 dicyanobutenes and comprising Ru and at least two homogeneous ligands having at least four ligating bonds bonding to said Ru, the Ru in each ruthenium complex datively bonding to a pendant atom in said polymer support, the Ru pendant atom ratio in said catalyst being at least 0.001, said complex having on the average no more than one homogeneous phosphine ligand per atom of ruthenium. Preferred ruthenium complexes are those which are substantially free of homogeneous phosphine ligands. The organic polymer support can be a terpolymer of 2 20 divinyl benzene, 0.4 to 6 para diphenylphosphenostyrene and the balance styrene.
