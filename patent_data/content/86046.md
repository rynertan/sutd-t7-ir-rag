# A process for the preparation of alpha 6 DEOXYTETRACYCLINES.

## Abstract
A process for the preparation of new stable homogeneous hydrogenation catalysts, comprising the reaction of a rho dium salt or complex with a hydrazine, or a salt thereof, eventually in the presence of excess tertiary phosphine, and their application in very reduced quantities in improved processes for the stereoselective hydrogenation of 6 deoxy 6 demethyl 6 methylenetetracyclines and for the simul taneous dehalogenation and stereoselective hydrogenation of 11a chloro 6 deoxy 6 demethyl 6 methylenetetracyclines, to furnish Î± 6 deoxy tetracyclines in high yields and purities.
