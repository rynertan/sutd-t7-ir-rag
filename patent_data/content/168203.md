# EXTERIOR AUTOMOBILE BODY PART MOLDED FROM THERMOPLASTIC COPOLYMER COMPOSITION

## Abstract
A molded exterior body part of an automobile, e.g. a bumper, is molded from a thermoplastic composition com prising, by weight, a 100 parts of a block copolymer of formula A B A The copolymer b should have a melt flow rate of 1g 10mm, e.g. 5 200g 10min. This copolymer provides good elasticity, low temperature impact strength, scratch resist ance and flowability, to the composition which is readily moldable from pellets thereof, e.g. by injection molding.
