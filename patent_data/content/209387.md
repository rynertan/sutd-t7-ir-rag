## Description
This invention relates to a semiconductor laser device. More particularly, it relates to a semiconductor laser device having a structure which is effective to control a transverse mode of laser oscillation, to lower the threshold current level and to increase the life span, and which is produced by the use of a crystal growth technique for the formation of ultra thin films such as molecular beam epitaxy MBE or metal organic chemical vapor deposition MO CVD . Such a laser of the In Ga As P type is disclosed in JP A 56 98889. Recently, a single crystal growth technique for the formation of thin films such as molecular beam epitaxy MBE , metal organic chemical vapor deposition MO CVD , etc., has been developed which enables the formation of thin film growth layers having a thickness of as thin as approximately 0.001 µm 10 Å . The development of such a technique, although these significantly thin films have not yet been produced by liquid phase epitaxy LPE , allowed the thin films to be applied to lasers, resulting in laser devices exhibiting new laser effects and or superior laser characteristics. A typical example of these new laser devices is a quantum well QW laser, which is produced based on the fact that quantization levels are established in its active layer by reducing the thickness of the active layer from several hundred Å to approximately 0.01 µm 100Å or less and which is advantageous over conventional double heterostructure lasers in that the threshold current level is low and the temperature and transient characteristics are superior. Such a quantum well laser is described in detail in the following papers As mentioned above, the single crystal growth technique, such as molecular beam epitaxy or metal organic chemical vapor deposition, has resulted in the practical use of high quality semiconductor lasers having a new multiple layered structure. However, the semiconductor laser is deficient in that a stabilized transverse mode of laser oscillation cannot be attained due to its multiple layered structure. One of the most important points requiring improvement in other conventional semiconductor lasers which are in practical use is stabilization of the transverse mode of laser oscillation. A contact stripe geometric laser, which was produced in the early stage of laser development, has a striped electrode to prevent injected current from transversely expanding, and attains laser oscillation in a zero order mode i.e., a fundamental transverse mode upon exceeding the threshold current level due to the fact that gain required for laser oscillation is greater than losses within the active region underneath the stripe region, while the said contact stripe geometric laser produces laser oscillation in an expanded transverse mode or a higher order transverse mode with an increase in the injection of current beyond the threshold current level, because carriers which are injected into the active layer spread to the outside of the striped region resulting in expanding the high gain region. Due to such an unstable transverse mode and dependency of the transverse mode on the amount of injected current, the linear relationship between the injected current and the laser output decreases. Moreover, the laser output resulting from pulse modulation is unstable so that the signal noise ratio is reduced and its directivity becomes too unstable to be used in an optical system such as optical fibers, etc. In order to overcome the above mentioned practical drawbacks of contact stripe geometric lasers, a variety of structures for semiconductor lasers of GaAlAs and or InGaAsP systems have been already produced by liquid phase epitaxy, which prevent not only current but also light from transversely expanding thereby attaining stabilization in the transverse mode. However, most of these semiconductor lasers can only be produced by the growth of thin film layers on a channeled substrate, a mesa substrate or a terraced substrate based on a peculiarity of liquid phase epitaxy, typical examples of which are channeled substrate planar structure injection lasers CSP lasers K.

All of these lasers can be only produced utilizing anisotrophy of the crystal growth rate, but they cannot be produced by the use of a crystal growth technique such as molecular beam epitaxy MBE or metal organic chemical vapor deposition MO CVD . Figure 3 of the accompanying drawings shows a conventional GaAlAs semiconductor laser operating in a stabilised transverse mode, which is produced as follows On an n GaAs substrate Moreover, this laser device has the significant drawback that it is mounted on a radiation plate of Cu, etc., by means of a soldering material such as In, etc., in order to improve heat radiation of the laser device. However, the distance from the portions of the active layer 3 corresponding to the regions other than the striped region 10 to the mounting face of the radiation plate is as extremely small as 1 µm or less, so that the active layer undergoes great stress due to thermal shrinkage based on a decrease in temperature after solidification of the soldering material. This makes the life span of the device short T.Hayakawa et al., Appl. Phys. Lett., vol. 42, pp.23 1983 . In addition, the distance between the active layer and the mounting face corresponding to the striped region 10 is different from the distance therebetween corresponding to the regions other than the striped region 10, so that the active layer further undergoes great stress at the interface between these regions at the different distances, which accelerates deterioration of the device. It is an object of the present invention to provide a semi conductor device which overcomes the above discussed disadvantages and deficiencies of the known devices. A semiconductor laser device in accordance with the present invention comprises a double heterostructure multi layered crystal containing an active layer for laser oscillation, a striped etching protective thin layer formed on said double heterostructure multi layered crystal, a striped mesa multi layered crystal formed on said striped etching protective thin layer and including a cladding layer containing aluminium and a burying layer containing aluminium and formed on said double heterostructure multi layered crystal outside of both the striped thin layer and the striped mesa multi layered crystal, characterised in that a said striped etching protective thin layer is made of GaAs, b the thickness of said striped etching protective thin layer is 0.02 µm 200 Å or less and c the aluminium mole fraction of said burying layer is greater than the aluminium mole fraction of said cladding layer, thereby providing refractive index distributions within said active layer corresponding to the inside and outside of said striped mesa multi layered crystal and providing a striped structure functioning as a current path of said striped mesa multi layered crystal. The invention described herein makes possible 1 a semiconductor laser device which is produced by a layer thickness control technique attained by molecular beam epitaxy and or metal organic chemical vapour deposition 2 a semiconductor laser device which operates at a low threshold current level in a stabilized transverse mode and 3 a semiconductor laser device which operates with high reliability for a long period of time. The invention is described further hereinafter, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which A semiconductor laser device of this invention attains stabilization of a transverse mode by utilizing an etching protective layer as a surface protective thin layer. Moreover, crystal growth of burying layers is selectively carried out in the regions other than the striped mesa region, resulting in the wafer having a flat surface, and thus the distance between the active layer and the mounting face of a radiation plate, on which the laser device is mounted, can be equal to 1 µm or more in the whole region containing the striped region, thereby attaining a lowering of stress to be imposed on the active layer.
