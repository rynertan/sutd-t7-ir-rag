# Method and apparatus for flaring a tube.

## Abstract
A continuous external flare 16 is formed around the end of a metal tube 15 which is of elliptical cross section by attaching a connector member 24,28 to the tube 15 and thereafter consequentially affixing to connector member 24,28 first and second flaring tools. Each tool has a pair of lugs 42,42 sized to enter the open end of the tube 15 when the lugs are mutually proximal and the lugs 42 of the first tool are displaceable along the major axes X X of the tube 15 whilst the lugs 42 of the second tool are displaceable along the minor axis Y Y of the tube 15 . To operate each tool the lugs are displaced from their mutually proximal position along the relevant axis of the tube to engage the rim of the tube 15 and to cold form the engaged portion of the rim into an external flare portion. Tube 15 incorporating flare end 16 is thereafter capable of being connected with good electrical connection to an end connec tor piece.
