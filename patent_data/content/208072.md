# Determination of silicon in molten metal.

## Abstract
Use of a sensor in the electro chemical determination of silicon dissolved in a molten metal, said sensor comprising a layer of a solid electrolyte capable of conducting oxygen ions, a reference electrode in contact with one surface of said layer of the solid electrolyte for providing a constant oxygen potential at a particular temperature of measurement, and an auxiliary electrode comprising SiOâ‚‚ disposed in the immedi ate vicinity of the other surface of said layer of the solid electrolyte.
