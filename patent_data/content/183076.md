# Process for producing 1,3 dimethyl 2 imidazolidinone.

## Abstract
A process for producing 1,3 dimethyl 2 imidazolidinone with a high yield which comprises reacting N,N dimethylethylene diamine and or its hydrochloride with phosgene in the presence of a substantial amount of water and a dehydrochlorinating agent. Particularly, higher yield is attained by carrying out the reaction in water medium while controlling a pH to the range of 3.0 to 10.0 by adding a dehydrochlorinating agent.
