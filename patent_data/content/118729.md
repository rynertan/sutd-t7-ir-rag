# A stabilized antenna system having an acceleration displaceable mass.

## Abstract
A stabilized antenna system is disclosed. The stabilized antenna platform includes an acceleration displaceable mass 200 which compensates for linear acceleration forces to inhibit tipping of the antenna platform 205 . The stabilized antenna system may include in combination a gimbal mounting 207 and one or more gyros 209 .
