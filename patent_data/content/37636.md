# RENDERING SUBSTRATES FIRE RETARDANT

## Abstract
Substrates such as foam and wadding are rendered fire retardant by a method which comprises coating the substrate with an effective fire retardant amount of a plastisol and then curing the plastisol coating, conveniently by heating, on the substrate. The resin component of the plastisol is preferably P.V.C. or a P.V.C copolymer and the plasticiser component thereof advantageously includes both a primary and a secon dary plasticiser. The plastisol optionally may also include viscosity depressants, foaming agents, stabilisers, fire retar dants, fillers, extenders and or curing agents. The method is particularly suitable for rendering materials used in furniture such as chairs and bedding fire retardant.
