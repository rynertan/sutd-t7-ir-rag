# Programmable cardiac pacemaker.

## Abstract
A programmable medical device, e.g. a cardiac pacemaker, utilizes digital circuitry 40 for controlling the pro vision of cardiac stimulating pulses and analog circuitry 42 for providing clocks, an output circuit and heart activity sensing. Digital circuit 40 includes a memory in which may be prog rammed on a permanent or temporary basis from an external programmer control information relating to rate, pulse width, pulse amplitude, refractory period, sense amplifier sensitivity and the mode of operation desired. In addition the output can be inhibited or a threshold margin test can be performed in which a reduced energy output pulse is provided to check if heart capture is lost. The pacemaker can operate in a hys teresis mode and provides a high rate limit which can how ever be exceeded by programming. The pacemaker further includes means for signalling the acceptance of a program ming signal and means to reset the program acceptance cir cuit if extraneous signals are detected as programming sign als. The acceptance circuit checks for the receipt of the proper number of signals within a given time, for an access code and correct parity. Timing is by means of a crystal oscillator and a voltage controlled oscillator controls pulse width to obtain energy compensation with varying battery voltage.
