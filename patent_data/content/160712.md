## Description
The present invention concerns traps for capture of insects, and more particularly it concerns traps of high efficiency for the capture of insects, which traps may be used both for a monitoring action on the population of insects in a particularly defined area and for the capture of insects in bulk. The capture of.insects with traps in a technique that is sprcading increasingly due to the extreme versatility of the results that may be obtained. ln fact, it is possible, by suitably positioning an adequate number of traps in a determined area, to follow the development and degree of an infestation monitoring action and to intervene as the proper moment, and only if necessary, with conventional insecticides, thereby obtain i ing a considerable economical saving and the protection of the environment. Moreover, it is possible, still with the help of traps, to carry out the capture of insects in bulk, thus succeeding iu lowering the number of individuals in a certain area, and thereby reducing the damages caused by the infestation. In both types of application, the insect is induced to approach and enter the trap by a seductive bait that may be of various kinds. The main types of usable baits are substances of an alimentary character phagoattractive agents and sexual pherohormones. The traps of widest use may be grouped in three main categories glue traps consisting of a chamber provided with orifices the inside walls of which are coated with a of immobilizing the insects that settle down on it. This type of trap, in general, is provided with a pherohormone as an attracting agent and is mainly used for monitoring actions water traps, consisting of a vessel containing an aqueous solution of surfactant, with a wide liquid surface open to air. The insect is enticed by a pherohormone contained in a dispenser suspended above the surface of the water.This type of trap is chiefly used for massive captures funnel shaped traps, consisting of a truncated cone or funnel sliaped section of plastic material in a vertical position and with the aperture of smaller diameter directed downwards and communicating with either a rigid or a soft removable capturing chamber. The insect may be attracted towards the latter type of trap either by a pherohormone contained in a dispenser suspended inside and immediately above the funnel entrance, or by a phagoattracting agent placed inside the chamber which communicates with the inlet funnel. This type of trap is suitable both for a monitoring action and for the massive capture of insects. Illustrations of water traps and funnel shaped traps with a soft chamber are shown in the work by M. Kehat S. Greenberg in Phytoparasitica 6 2 , pages 79 83 1978 . As mentioned above, the funnel shaped traps consist of a funnel shaped entrance or inlet of plastic material in general polyethylene placed vertically with respect to the aperture of smaller diameter communicating with the rigid catching or capturing chamber for instance a bottle of plastic material or with a soft catching chamber for instance a bag made of polyethylene . Once the insect has entered the trap through the funnel, it becomes very difficult for it to find its way out again, especially so when the walls of the catching chamber are transparent to light and also because in general the end of the funnel extends deep into the inside of the c1amber. If desired, it is moreover possible, but in general not necessary, to place, inside the chamber, an aqueous solution of a surfactant or an insecticide. In order to increase boost the efficiency of this type of traps, it is important that the insect does not cling to the walls of the funnel and that, once settled, it will slip along the inside of the funnel to fall into the capturing chamber. The legs of many species of insects are provided with microscopical hooks with which the insect easily clings to a surface. For instance the insects of the species Spodo tera littoral is remain attached to a polyethylene surface also when this latter is inclined titled up to 900. Consequently, in funnel shaped traps the walls of which have a slant of between about 300 and about 6do, some insects cling to the walls without slippping down into the capturing chamber. Consequently, the effectiveness of the trap is impaired. In order to obviate this drawback, at least in part, it has been suggested by A. Navon Phytoparasitica6 1 , pages 21 24 1978 to deposit on the internal walls of the funnel a thin layer of kaolin or talc. The particles of said substance will adhere to the legs of the insects thereby reducing their clinging capacity rendering it less effective . This solution, which increases the number of insects captured with respect to identical traps not coated with talc or kaolin is, however, not very useful over long stretches of time. In fact, tie talc or kaolin coating is easily removed and carried away by the mechanical action of winds and by rain and even by the condensed humidity. The small roof that often is placed above the funnel entrance, also as a point of suspension for the pherohormone dispenser, is not sufficient to prevent the washing out action. Moreover, the talc or kaolin coating did not prove useful for the capture of small sized insects such as, for instance, microleptidocters. We have now found that the efficiency of the funnel type traps can be boosted by coating the inside wall of the funnel with polytetrafluoroethylene and that said coating proves more effective than talc or kaolin in hindering the insects from climbing along the walls of the funnel. Moreover, the polytetrafluoroethylene coating maintains its efficacy over long periods of time inasmuch as it will not be washed away by water while being resist ant to the removing action of the wind and to the rubbing action of the insects legs. Thus, an object of this invention is to provide a trap for insects consisting of an entrance of plastic material of a truncated cone or funnel shape, arranged vertically with the aperture of smaller diameter turned downwards and communicating with a catching chamber of either rigid or soft material, suitably fitted with an enticing substance such as pherohormone or a phagoattracting agent, possibly also containing, in the catching chamber, as insecticide and or an aqueous solution of a surfactant, and characterized in that the inside wall of the funnel entrance is uniformly coated with polytetrafluoroethylene. A further object of this invention is that of using the traps according to the main object of this invention for a monitoring action on the course and degree of the infestation or for effecting the capture or catching in bulk massive capture of insects in a specific area. The preparation of polytetrafluoroethylene coated funnels is carried out either by spraying or by brushing, using an aqueous dispersion of the polymer, as described hereinbelow. If desired, it is also possible to coat the funnel by dipping it into the coating dispersion. TIie polytetra fluoroethylene is readily available commercially in the form of an aqueous dispersion of particles with a granulometric distriblltion comprised between 0.2 and 0.4 microns, These suspensions, in general, consist of 50 61 by weight of polymer and of 2.5 4 by weight of a non ionic dispersant, the rest being water. The dispersion in general contains ammonia and has a basic pH of 8 to 10. These commercial dispersions may be directly used as such for coating the entrance funnels of the traps according to this invention. When the application is carried out b brushing, it may be convenient to add to the dispersion a minor quantity of glue for instance 3 5 by weight such as, for instance, polyvinylacetate. in order to improve the consistency of the deposited coat. The traps according to this invention are suitable for use in the capture of different species of flying insects, among which there may be cited, as examples Musca domestic, Cossus cossus, Autogranha mamma, Lobesia botrana, Cvdia molesta, Epychoristodes acerbella, Spodon tera littoralis, Ephestia sop., Plodia interpunctella, Thaumet opoea pitvocampa, Heliothis spp., Pectinophora gossipiella Bupoecilia ambiuella. The traps according to this invention are suitably dimensioned in relationship to the size of insect to be captured. For instance, for the capture of insects ofCydia molesta mean wing span 11 mm useful traps have an entrance or inlet funnel with the upper aperture or inlet showing a diameter of 10 cm and the lower aperture a diameter of 2.2 cm, while the catching or capturing chamber has a holding capacity or inner volume of about 500 ml. For insects of larger size, such as Cossus cossus mean wing span 65 mm , there are preferred traps with an inlet fllnne3 having an upper diameter of 17.5 cm and a lower diameter of 3.8 cm, and a catching or capturing chamber of 1,500 ml holding capacity The slant of the inelt funnel walls, in general, equals 600, for reason of the ready availability of such funnels on the market. In fact, slants below 600 down to 300 would be quite sufficient, due the high slipping characterist ics of the coating which hinders an effective grip of the insect on the fwel1s walls see Example 1 . The resistance of the polytetrafluoroethylene coating to wasilin away has proved to be very high. As an example, the poiytetrafluoroethylene coating of a funnel shaped trap exposed to the open air for four weeks in the periodSeptember October 1982, remained completely unaltered in spite of the fact that in that period there had fallen 50 mm of rain distributed over five precipitations of which two were of a stormy character. For practical use in agriculture, the traps according to tlie present invention an.e used in an analogous way as the similar traps with a funnel uncoated inside or coated with talc or kaolin. The number of traps per surface unit, and their specific positioning, depend on the species of insect to be captured, on the efficacy of the attractant used, on the climatic and environmental conditions, on the type of cultivation in the involved and surrouding areas, on the type of action to be carried out monitoring or mass capture as well as on several other factors, in a manner absolutely similar to that which is considered conventio nal for the purpose. Analogously, the traps of the present invention are used according to the normal procedures for the capture of insects, such as flies which infest places frequented by humans or domestic animals and cattle. The following non limiting examples are given to illustrate the invention in more detail. EXAMPLE 1A number of adult males of Spodoptera littorais lepidoptera were placed on polyethylene plates, some of which had been coated with talc, kaolin or polytetrafluoroethylene.These plates were then progressively tilted by raising the end in the direction of the insect s head. At an angle of 290 3Oo th insect resting on the plate of polytetra fluoroetliylcne started slipping towards the lower end of the plate. On the talc or kaolin coated plates the insects stai ted slipping downwards at a slant angle of 600 65 . On said plates there had, however, become evident scratches left on the coating by the legs of the insects. The uncoated polyethylene plates, on the contrary, offered a hold grip to the insects also in a perpendicular position 900 . EXAMPLE 2Preparation of pherohormone baited traps.The traps were prepared by hermetically and tightly connecting a bottle of the choswlholding capacity and made of plastic material transparent or semitransparent to light, to a polyethylene funnel of suitable size, so that the lower end of the funnel extended well into the inside of the bottle for a few centimeters 5 7 cm .The coating of the inside wall of the funnel with kaolin had been carried out by brushing, on the inside of the funnel, a kaolin suspension granulometry equal to 1 Am in dichloroiiiethane, and allowing the solvent to evaporate in the airs. The traps with funnel inside coated with polytetrafluoro ethylene, according to the present invention, were prepared by brush painting the inside of the funnel with an aqueous suspension of Algoflon registered trademark ofMONTEFLUOS Company for polytetrafluorethylenel at a 60 by weight concentration, containing 37 b.w. of water and 3 b.w. of a non ionic dispersant Triton X lOOn registered trademark of Rohm Haas .All traps Iliad been equipped with a small circular roof with a diameter about 5 6 cm greater than that of the greater aperture of the funnel, and suspended 3 6 cm above the funnel entrance by metal wires. These same metal wires, extending beyond and above the roof, serve four possibly hanging the traps on special supports or on the branches of trees. A dispenser of natural rubber imbued with the pherohormone hangs from the center of the small roof and is arranged in such a way as to hang at level with the entrance of greater diameter of the funnel, or suspended inside the funnel itself.The size of the capturing chamber bottle and of the funnel and the type of pherohormone to be used vary in relation to the species of insects taken into consideration, as appears in the following examples from 3 to 6.EXAMPLE 3Catching tests on insects of the Cvdia molesta species mean wing span 11 mm .There were prepared, following the procedures decribed in Example 2, eight s 8 traps of the following characteri stics volume holding capacity of chamber about 500 ml, funnel upper diameter 10. cm lower diameter 2.2 cm.Four traps were also coated on the inside of the funnel with pojytetrafluoroethylene according to the procedures described in Example 2.Pherohormone dispensers were then prepared by imbuing natural I ubbt.r with a mixture of Z 8 dodecenyl acetate 280 g , E 8 dodecenyl acetate 20 g , dodecanol 1,000 g and Z 8 dodccanol 4 g .Said mixture is described as attracting the males of theCydia m.1esta species by B. Sautbanor et al in their book La Defense des Végétaux t No. 205, page 247 1980 .The capturing or catching tests were carried out during the period from September 8 to October 7, 1982, in a commercial peach grove infested naturally.In addition to the eight traps described herein, there were also used, for comparative purposes, four traps of the glue type Traptest traps, registered trademark ofMONTEDISON S.p.A. , equipped with a similar pherohormone dispenserThe eight traps were placed in a peach orchard, distanced 30 meters from each other, and at regular intervals were inverted in their position in a casual way.The results were surveyed weekly, counting the number of males of Cvdia molests caught by each trap. At each checking, the glued bottoms of the glue traps were replaced The glue traps, during the test period, captured an average of 26.6 males of the species per trap per week.The funnel traps that had not been treated, as an average caught 17.5 males of the species per trap per week, while the funnel traps with the inside of the funnel coated with polytetrafluoroethylene according to this invention, had captured an average of 75.2 males of the species per trap per week. EXAMPLE 4 Catching test on insects of Enidroristodes acerbella species mean wing span 18 mm . Eight traps of the same size as those of Example 3 were prepared. Four of these traps were coated on the funnel inside with polytetrafluoroethylene. The pherohormone dispensers were imbued with a mixture of Z 11 tetradecenyl acetate 1,600 flog , Z 9 tetradece nyl acetate 400 g , Z ll tetradecenol 160g and Z 9 tetradecenol 40 A g . Said mixture is described by E. Arsura et al in Atti del le Giornate Fitopatologiche , vol. III, pages 327 332 1982 , as being attractive for the males of the Epichori stodes açerbella species. The test was carried out over a period from September 24 to November 5, 1982, in a zone typical for floriculture, on carnation growing plots. For comparative purposes, there were used four Traptest glue traps fitted with similar dispensers. On four plots of about 500 sq.mt. there were placed three traps for each plot one trap per type and the positions of the traps were periodically changed. Results of the tests were taken on a weekly basis, count ing the number of males of the Enichoristodes acerbella species captured by each trap. The glue traps, during the test period, as an average captured 12.2 males of the species per trap per week the funnel traps with untreated funnel wall captured 0.8 males per trap per week as an average, while the traps with a poytetra luoroethylene treated funnel caught, as an average, 23.0 males per trap per week.EXAMPLE 5Test for tite capture of insects of the Autographa gamma species average wing span 40 mm .There were prepared, according to the procedures described in Example 2, eight funnel traps showing the following characteristics volume holding capacity of capturing chamber I,000 ml funnel upper diameter 12. cm lower diameter 2.6 cm.Four 4 of these traps were coated on the inside of the funnel with polytetrafluoi oethylene, according to the procedures described in Example 2. Thereupon, there were prepared four dispensers by imbuing natural rubber with Z 7 dtt.J.acenyl acetate 1 g . Said substance is described by I. Ghizdavu et al in Rev. Roum. Biol. , 24, pages 8 9O 1978 , as an attlacting agent for males of the Autorapha gamma species.The test was carried out over a period from August 19 toSeptembcr 16, 1982, on a plot of about 2 hectars, planted with forage Jeguminosae. For comparative purposes, there were used four traps of the Traptest type, fitted with a similar dispenser. The twelve traps were placed along the perimeter of the plot, distanced about 50 meters from each other, and their posi tions were changed periodically in a casual way.The results wcre surveyed weekly, counting the number of males of the Autoeranha gamma species captured by eacl trap.During the testing period, the glue traps captured an average of 8.2 males of the species per trap per week the traps with untreated funnels, on average, captured 4.0 males per trap per week, while the traps with the funnels treated according to the present invention, as an average, captured 14.3 males of the species per trap per week.EXAMPLE 6Capturing tests on insects of the Cossus cossus species mean wing span 65 mm .There were prepared, according to the procedures described in Example 2, eight 8 traps having the following characteristics volume holding capacity of capturing chamber 1,500 ml funnel upper diameter 17.5 cm lower diameter 3.8 cm. Four 4 of these traps were treated by coating the inside wall of the funnel with polytetrafluoroethylene, according to the procedures followed in Example 2.Thereupon, the dispensers were prepared by imbuing natural rubber with a mixture of Z 5 dodecenyl acetate 800at and Z 3 dodecenyl acetate 200 s g . Said mixture has been described as attractant for the males of the Cossus cossus species, in European PatentApplication No. 055475 Montedison S.p.A. . The test was carried out during the period from July 15 to August 5, 1982, in a willow and poplar wood used as a r epopulation zone in an animal farm.For comparative purposes, there were used four Traptest traps fitted with an analogous dispenser. The twelve traps were disposed, at intervals of 50 meters from each other, at the borders of the wood. The positions thereof were periodically inverted in a casual way.The results were assessed weekly by counting the number of males of Cossns cossus captured by each trap. The glue traps, during the test period, as an average captured 4.3 males of the species per trap per week the funnel traps with untreated funnel averagely captured 5.2 males of the species per trap per week, while the funnel traps treated according to the invention captured an average of 9.7 males of the species per trap per week.EXAMPLE 7Capturing tests on insects of the Musca domestica species.There were prepared traps consisting of a capturing chamber of transparent plastic material, in the shape of a cylindrical vase closed at the top by a truncated conelike funnel without stem, made of polyethylene, with its larger aperture turned upwards and at levels with the rim of the capturing chamber, while the smaller sized aperture extended into the inside of the capturing chamber.These traps had the following characteristics volume holding capacity of capturing chamber 700 ml upper diameter of capturing chamber 15 cm greater diameter of the funnel 15 cm smaller diameter of the funnel 2.5 cm slant of funnel wall 60 Six tr were ustu for the tests. Of these, two had the funnel s inside wall coated with talc and two with poly tetrafluoroethylene, according to the operating procedures followed in Example 2, while the remailling two traps were left unaltered.A phagoattracting agent consisting of molasses diluted in a hydro alcoholic solution with 30 ethyl alcohol was placed inside each trap.The test was carried out in a suitably conditioned room maintained at a temperature of 230C 1 C, 75 5 of relative humidity and the room was illuminated by fluorescent tubes 2,500 lux . The photoperiod was 16 hours. The six traps were placed in said room and into it were then let loose 200 insects of Musca domestica 50 males and 50 females .The duration of the test amouned to seven days. At the end of each test day, the insects not captured were eliminated, the number of insects captured in each trap was counted, and intro the room were introduced a further 200 insects of the species.Over the test period, the traps with the untreated funnel had captured an average of 11.1 insects per trap per day the traps with the funnels coated inside with talc had captured an average of 17.9 insects per trap per day, while the traps treated according to the present invention averaged 47 insects captured per trap per day.
