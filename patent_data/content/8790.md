# Microwave filter having means for capacitive interstage coupling between transmission lines.

## Abstract
A microwave filter comprising within a conductive cas ing, a plurality of resonant transmission lines 10 12 arranged parallel between opposed end walls 23, 24 of the casing, a plurality of shielding members 16, 17 each located between adjacent transmission lines, and a capacitive interstage coupl ing member disposed transverse to the transmission line. The interstage coupling member comprises a dielectric member 30 and a plurality of conductive regions 31 33 arranged successively thereon so as to establish capacitive coupling between adjacent conductive regions. Each transmission line is connected at one end to a side wall 21 of the casing and supported at the other end by the dielectric member 30 in electrical contact with a respective one of the conductive reg ions 31 33 , whereby the interstage coupling between the transmission lines is provided by the capacitively coupled conductive regions.
