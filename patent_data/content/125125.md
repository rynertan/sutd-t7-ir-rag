# An agent for inhibiting the proliferation of malignant tumour cells and a process for the preparation thereof.

## Abstract
Agents for inhibiting the proliferation of malignant tumour cells are described together with processes for their preparation. Malignant tumour cells are cultivated in a culture medium for a period before being removed therefrom. By means of fractional filtration from the culture medium, that fraction having a molecular weight of not less than 500 is separated. Results show that this fraction has a significant inhibiting effect against proliferation of malignant tumour cells.
