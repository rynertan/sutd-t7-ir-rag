# Catalyst preparation.

## Abstract
A catalyst suitable for the catalysis of the oxidation of carbon monoxide is prepared by providing the substrate with tin IV oxide support material and with a catalytically active material. The tin IV oxide is provided by contacting the substrate with a dispersion of colloidal or non colloidal particles in a liquid medium, said dispersion being convertible to tin IV oxide by drying and firing, followed by drying and firing. A catalyst can be so produced having low flow resistance, high low temperature activity and relative insensitivity to deacti vation by moisture. The dispersion may, for example, be a tin IV oxide aqua sol made, for example, by peptising hydrated stannic oxide with a quarternary ammonium hydroxide.
