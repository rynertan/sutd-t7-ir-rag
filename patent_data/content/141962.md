The best mode contemplated by the inventors of carrying out this invention will now be described so as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains to make and use the same. In view of the process aspects described hereinabove, it is readily apparent that the hydrazine compounds can react with the fluorans at one or both of the hydrazine nitrogens to obtain a five membered or a six membered ring system of Formulas I and V, respectively, or in the instances where the fluorans contains hydroxy moieties, a five membered ring compound of Formula IV or an open ring compound of Formula XII. Ordinarily, the mode in which the react ion is carried out, mixtures of the compounds ofFormulas I and V and mixtures of Formulas IV and XII are obtained. These individual compounds can be isolated if desired by conventional means, such as fractional recrystallization, preparative chromatography, or other methods commonly used in the art.However, since both of the compounds obtained by the process aspects are operative in the electrochromic recording systems, it is unnecessary to separate the compounds, and in fact, it is economically advantageous not to separate the compounds and to use them as a mixture. In accordance with one of the aforementioned process aspects of this invention, the compounds of FormulasI and V are obtained by reacting one molecular proportion of ,a fluoran compound of Formula X with at least one molecular proportion of a R6 substituted hydrazine of Formula XI.This reaction is conveniently carried out in an appropriate inert organic liquid, for example, a glycol such as ethylene glycol or propylene glycol a glycol ether such as ethoxyethanol commonly known as the ethyl ether of ethylene glycol or an aliphatic amide such as N,N dimethylformamide.Alternatively, the reaction can be run neat with an excess of the hydrazine, for example, phenylhydrazine serving as the reaction medium. This reaction is conveniently carried out at a temperature in the range of 900 to 1800C, usually at the reflux temperature for periods of approximately thirty minutes to approximately forty eight hours. Mixtures of compounds of Formulas I and V thus obtained are isolated directly from the reaction medium after chilling. Alterna tively, the desired product can be isolated by pouring the reaction mixture into a mixture of ice and water and filtering the precipitated product. The isolated product can be purified by conventional means such as recrystallization or reslurrying with a suitable organic liquid and then collected by filtration.Alternatively, the purification can be combined with the isolation by extracting the product from the mixture of ice, water and product with a suitable water immiscible organic liquid, for example, toluene and then concentrating the organic liquid solution of the product by conventional means such as evaporation or distillation. In some instances, Åas described in greater detail in the examples hereinbelow, the compounds of Formula V are, to a large extent, insoluble in the reaction medium and can be removed directly by filtration. The filtrate obtained is then poured into a mixture of ice and water, and a mixture comprised predominantly of a compound of Formula I and, to a smaller extent, a compound of Formula V, is isolated by filtration. The isolated mixtures can be further purified and or separated into the individual components by conventional means such as recrystallization, reslurrying in a suitable organic liquid followed by filtration, preparative chromatography or any one of numerous other methods of purification and separation available in the art. However, since both of the compounds have activity as electrochromic color forming materials ordinarily the mixtures obtained are used without further separation into the individual components. In accordance with the second of the aforementioned process aspects of this invention, the compounds ofFormulas IV and XII are obtained by reacting fluoran compounds of Formula XIII with a R6 substituted hydrazine of Formula XI. This reaction is conveniently carried out in an appropriate inert organic liquid, for example, a glycol such as ethylene glycol or propylene glycol or a glycol ether such as ethoxyethanol commonly known as the ethyl ether of ethylene glycol. The reaction is conveniently carried out at a temperature in the range of 900 to 1800C, usually at the reflux temperature, for periods of approximately thirty minutes to approximately forty eight hours.Mixtures of compounds of Formulas IV and XII thus obtained are isolated by pouring the reaction mixture into a mixture of ice and water and filtering the resulting product. The isolated product can be purified by conventional means such as recrystallization or resiurrying with a suitable organic liquid followed by filtration. Alternatively, the purification can be combined with the isolation by extracting the mixture of ice, water and product with a suitable water immiscible organic liquid, for example, toluene and then concentrating the organic liquid solution of the product by conventional means such as evaporation or distillation. In some instances as described in greater detail in the examples hereinbelow, the compounds of Formula IV are, to a large extent, insoluble in the reaction medium and can be removed directly by filtration.The filtrate obtained is then poured into a mixture of ice and water, and a mixture comprised predominantly of the compounds of Formula XII and, to a small extent, the compounds of Formula IV, is isolated by filtration. The isolated mixtures can be further purified and or separated into the individual components by conventional means such as recrystallization, reslurrying in a suitable organic liquid followed by filtration, preparative chromatography or any one of numerous other methods of purification and separation available in the art. However, since both of the compounds have activity as electrochromic color forming materials ordinarily the mixtures obtained are used without further separation into the individual components. Some of the starting fluorans of Formulas X andXIII are mixtures of 5 Y and 6 Y isomers by virtue of their method of preparation as described in the patents cited hereinbelow. It will of course be appreciated that the reaction of such mixtures with hydrazines as described hereinabove results in the production of mixtures of 6 Yand 7 Y 2,3 dihydro spiro phthalazine 1 4H ,9 19H xan thene 4 ones, 5 Y and 6 Y spirollH isoindole 1,9 9H xanthene 3 2H ones and esters thereof and 9 2 N R6 hydrazinocarbonyl 5 Y and 6 Y phenyl 3H xanthene 3 ones. Throughout this application, the nomenclature 5 6 and 6 7 is adopted to indicate location of the Y substituent. It is unnecessary to separate the individual isomers either ,in the starting fluorans or the final products because both isomers of the latter are useful in the practice of this invention. The compounds of Formulas X and XIII hereinabove, which are required as starting materials in the preparation of the final products of Formulas I, V and XII, are known generically as fluor ans.

When contacted with an electric current from an applied voltage stylus of the type ordinarily employed in electrochromic recording systems, the compounds of Formulas I, V and VIII develop red, green, blue green, blue, purple, magenta, gray, and black colored images. These developed images are very insensitive to light, that is, once the color is developed it remains unchanged when subjected to light exposure.The developed images also possess excellent xerographic reproducibility. The compounds of this invention my be incorporated in any of the commercially accepted systems known in the electrochromic recording art. Typical techniques for the application of the color formers to paper are well known and are described in numerous patents, for example, U.S.Patents Re. 29,427 3,726,769 3,864,684 3,871,972 3,951,757 4,017,366 and 4,133,933. In general, these references describe paper coatings which consist of the color forming component, an organic metal salt, a binder and some type of conductor, either an inorganic salt or a conductive polymer.This mixture is milled together optionally in the presence of a non ionic surface active agent until the desired particle size is obtained and then the mixture is coated on paper and dried. Optionally, the color forming substance can be milled in the presence of a binder and the remaining components milled also in the presence of a binder and the two mixtures combined together ,prior to coating on paper. Normally the surface of the coated paper is wet with a conductive solution containing an inorganic alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salt, for example, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, sodium chloride, sodium bromide, potassium bromide, potassium nitrate or sodium sulfate immediately prior to the printing with the applied voltage stylus. For a quick qualit.ative test, it has been determined that the color forming component can be dissolved in a suitable volatile organic solvent, coated on paper and the coated paper dried to obtain a paper sheet coated with the color forming component. This coated sheet can then be wet with a conductive salt solution and an image traced with an applied voltage stylus to develop the colored image. The compounds of Formulas I, Y and VIII can be used alone as color forming components in electrochromic recording paper, can be used in admixture, or in admixture with one or more other color forming compounds selected from the classes consisting of phthalides, for example,Crystal Violet Lactone .fluorans, for example, 3 diethyl amino 5, 7 dimethylfluoran redox indicators, for example, phenothiazines such as benzoyl leuco methylene blue and various other types. of color forming components currently employed in commercially available electrochromic recording systems.
