# A hydrogen evolution electrode.

## Abstract
A hydrogen evolution electrode having a coating con taining an oxide of at least one metal selected from the group consisting of nickel, cobalt and silver has been found to exhibit extremely low hydrogen overvoltage and to have not only high catalytic activity but also high durability. When the electrode having a reduced coating fabricated by reduction of said coating containing the oxide of said at least one metal, the resulting electrode exhibits extremely low hydrogen overvoltage even if the proportion of the oxide or oxides in the coating is small. Further, the electrode having a composite coating in which, beside the oxide of said at least one metal, at least one metal or oxide thereof which metal has a valency smaller than that of the first mentioned at least one metal is additionally present in said coating, the electrode exhibits further extremely low hydrogen overvoltage, even if the proportion of oxide in the coating is large.
