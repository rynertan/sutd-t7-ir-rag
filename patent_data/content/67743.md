# Surgical stapler apparatus with pivotally mounted actuator assemblies.

## Abstract
Surgical stapling apparatus comprising a frame for supporting a stapling assembly adjacent a distal portion of the frame a first actuator means pivotally mounted relative to a proximal portion of the frame a second actuator means mounted relative to the frame for both pivotal and reciprocal motion and located intermedi ate the first actuator means and the stapling assembly and means for interconnecting the first and second actuator means so that the second actuator means responds to pivoting of the first actuator means by translating toward the stapling assembly and at least partially actuating the stapling assembly.
