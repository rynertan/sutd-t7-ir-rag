# METHOD FOR PRODUCING CASINGS LIKE CABINETS AND DOORS OF REFRIGERATION APPLIANCES, AND MACHINE ARRANGEMENT THEREFOR

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method for producing casings 1 like cabinets and doors of refrigerator appliances, in which reactive polyurethane is fed into the interspace between an inner and outer wall 2, 4 of the casing. In order to increase the productivity the polymerisation reaction takes place in two successive positions, a first phase of the reaction taking place in the first position upon which first counteracting means 14, 14A. 15 are removed at least from the outer walls and the casing is brought into a second position in which second counteracting means 21, 21A, 22 are placed against the outer walls of the casing and whereupon the second and final phase of the polymerisation reaction takes place. The invention relates also to a machine arrangement for perform ing the method.
