# SELF ACTING ARM FOR THE FEEDING AND UNLOADING OF MACHINES IN GENERAL

## Abstract
A self acting arm for the feeding and unloading of machines in general, consisting of a fixed casing, in which are housed guides allowing the sliding of an articulated quadrilateral carrying at the ends of its movable sides an arm equipped with grasping members. This arm, rotatably connected to said quadrilateral, is provided both with vertical upward and downward motion, by means of cams placed at the ends of said guides, and with reciprocating horizontal motion obtained by means of a link control system providing the utilization of a horizontal guide, of a vertically to and fro slidable cylinder rigidly connected thereto, of a geared motor which imparts a rotating movement to a crank having one end thereof rotatably engaged in said horizontal guide and of gears and chains suitable for driving the movement.
