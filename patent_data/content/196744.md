# Manually operated labeller.

## Abstract
A labeller for dispensing labels stuck onto a carrier strip 71 comprises a handle 11 a drive mechanism including a lever 23 pivotably mounted on the labeller casing 10 and an operating part 24 which extends into the casing and a feed mechanism 40 , driven by the operating part, for feeding the carrier strip. The casing is provided with a bottom cover 60 which forms part of its base and is pivotably mounted to the casing at one end. The free end of the cover forms the carrier strip turnback part. One side wall of the casing is divided by a slit 13 and the pivot point of the cover and the carrier strip feed mechanism are located to the handle side of the slit. The arrangement is such that said label tape may be positioned in the casing by inserting it laterally into the slit.
