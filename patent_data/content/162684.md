# Fiber containing particulate elastomeric composition.

## Abstract
A particulate elastomeric composition having a density ratio of 0.1 to 0.4 comprising 5 75 by weight of an elasto mer, 15 65 by weight of a filler and 10 60 by weight of aramid pulp and a solution process for its preparation. The composition is useful as a masterbatch for the introduction of aramid pulp into elastomeric articles.
