# Decoder and method of decoding.

## Abstract
In a decoder and method utilizing logic circuitry for decoding multi bit digital signals, an input decoder 16 decodes subsets of the input signals to provide a plurality of intermediate signals which are selectively combined to pro vide output signals which represent a desired decoding of the input signals. The intermediate signals are applied to gener ally parallel bus lines 18 which, in one form, extend centrally of the substrate on which the decoder is constructed the logic circuits are arranged in blocks Bl Bn along both sides of the bus lines 18 , with all of the bus lines extending past all of the logic blocks, and conductors 21 extending transversely of the bus lines carry the appropriate intermediate signals from the bus lines to the logic blocks. Output signals are provided on lines 19 . The device is particularly suitable for decoding the operation codes of a computer instruction set.
