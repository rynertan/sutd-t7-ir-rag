# Termination for electrical armature winding.

## Abstract
The present invention provides an armature for an electrical device having a connection between an armature winding 32 and an armature termination 34 , the armature being connectable to an external circuit by the termination 34 . Conventionally such connections have been provided by welding, soldering and similar techniques. There are a number of disadvantages with such techniques which are mitigated by the present invention. The armature of this invention comprises a housing 18 in which a portion of the armature winding 32 is located and in which the termination 34 includes a terminal 36 having a configuration for establishing and maintaining electrical contact between the terminal 36 and the said winding portion 32 while retaining the terminal 36 and the said winding portion 32 within the housing 18 . Preferably, the terminal 36 includes slots 48 which pass over the winding portion 32 and in so doing sever the insulation of the winding portion 32 so as to effect electrical contact. A boss 28 is provided within the housing 18 and the winding portion 32 is held against the boss 28 as the terminal 36 straddles the boss 28 .
