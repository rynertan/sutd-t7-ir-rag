# Method of repairing blast furnace wall lining.

## Abstract
In repairing a lining damage in a blast furnace, the furnace is blown down after lowering the burden inside to below the damaged part. Then a plurality of openings and a refractories filling aperture 19 are provided across the furnace wall in the damaged part. A preliminarily prepared panel 9 is hung down through an opening in the furnace top to a position opposite to the damaged part. One end of a string like member 11 whose other end is fastened to the panel 9 is drawn outside the furnace through one of the openings. The whole length of the string like member 11 is protectively covered by a single 17 or double support tube 17, 17 and stretched therethrough. Monolithic refractories 20 are pressed in through the refractories filling aperture 19 into a clearance between the damaged part 6 and panel 9 either during blowing down or after blowing in.
