# Heat accumulating material.

## Abstract
The heat accumulating material of this invention com prising three components of calcium chloride CaCl₂ , urea CO NH₂ ₂ and water H₂O can have varied temperatures of heat accumulating and heat releasing between 15 C and 29.5 C by varying the proportion of said three components, and also has a large latent heat. Hence, much expectation can be placed on it as a heat accumulating material for air conditioning. Moreover, by adding BaFeO
