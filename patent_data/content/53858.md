## Description
A method for the manufacture of frontage characters and similar decorations, and use of products obtained according to this method.Applicant Inventor Francis R.M. odzelmans, of Breda Netherlands .A method for the manufacture of frontage characters by sawing elements from slabs of foamed polymer of increased density and strength, which elements are then coated with a structured layer and painted.This invention relates to a method for the manufacture of frontage characters and decorations,as well as to products obtained according to this method.Frontage characters, such as signs, letters, types, brands, are of considerable importance for enterprises and offices in order to provide for identification and as a means of indication of the seat of a company, and it implicates in the function of publicity and marketing activity.Therefore it is desirable that frontage characters should have a beautiful and appropriate shape, that th e readability and distinctiveness will be good, even under differing circumstances of illumination and at large distance, while a proper substantial feature is performed, and sufficient resistance against influences of the weather will be maintained, even in climatologically precarious surroundings.Frontage characters of metal, solid wood, acrylate plastics, and neon characters of glass, are most commonly known.Although widely used, said mentioned frontage characters have severe disadvantages. The costs of manufacture and construction are high, characters of metal have a tendency to corrode, characters of solid wood will warp, characters of acrylate become lustreless and dull and might crack and smash. Characters of said materials cannot be obtained in all colours desired,while neon characters,although widely used, are subject to damage rather easily because these articles are of glass and evacuated.Neon characters often are subject to disorder in performance, because either the glass walls or the metal contacts and other switching elements are disturbed by storm, hail etc., and then do not function correctly any more.It is not unusual to see neon headings or signs on buildings, which are mutilated or which show a bad or irregular discharge.Moreover the moulding and the fastening of frontage characteristics consisting of these known materials generally give rise to considerable problems because all these materials have also the disadvantage of a high weight. The fastening has to be proportionally heavy.Also damagings of frontages, gutters and connection means occur frequently, caused by movements of the characters brought about by weather influences.A seamless construction of characters of very large dimensions, as often desirable on the roofs of buildings, is not possible. The known materials are related to standard dimensions which have an upper limit for each respective material.With known frontage characters part of the fastening device should already be fixed at the character preceding to the mounting of same, and consequently the spot,where drilling in the frontage is necessary, should be determined most accurately. This is a disadvantage mainly with profile sections of walls, such as undulatory and barrage sheet sections, because of the differences in height of such profiles, and also with bricks,because of the difference in height and hardness of joints or seams of the bricks.Because of these aforesaid disadvantages, search has been made for a method of manufacturing frontage characters, which renders the possibility to obtain a tasteful but striking type, which is seamless, can have any desired dimension and thickness and any desired colour, and which is moreover durable and light weight, which during the erection can be attached at any given spots and can be mounted without damaging of the shop front or of the roof, while it is not to be feared that damaging attack by weather influences could occur.The method as mentioned in the introduction according to the present invention is characterized in that the characters and or decorations are sawn out in the shape as desired from a slab of rigid polymer, foamed in the form of a homogeneous block, further coated all sided with a layer or sheath of polymer emulsion plaster, which is filled with mineral material, and which is dilutable with water and cures at the air, that then it is treated with a roller, dried and finally painted over the structured surface obtained, in the colour as desired.The sawing might be carried out along the lines of a pictural design, which is photographically projected upon the surface of the material.The polymer slabs are preferably homogeneously foamed slabs of rigid fire resistant polystyrene foa , hich,by use of pressure during the foaminthas obtained an increased density and strength2 such that the material is more rigid and substantially stronger than the usual expanded and agglomerated polystyrene or polyurethane foam in globular form.Prior to or after the sawing but in any case prior to the coating or pargeting with the layer of mineral filled polymer emulsion plaster, the material can be reinforced or supported by means of a layer of thin triplex and or by gauze or by rods of a material wellradhesive to the said foam.A rigid polymer or rigid copolymer foam of polystyrene,which is foamed up in lots and which is densified,is very suitable for the purpose according to the present invention.However any other homogeneous polymer foam material of different composition than the one mentioned will be suitable for the de ribbed method as well,if it has only the same or similar properties as the homogeneously foamed and densified polystyrene foamA most important feature is the created seamless layer of air curing mineral filled polymer emulsion plaster.The invention relates also to the frontage characters as objects, and to decorations, vignettes, signs, etcetera, manufactured according to the method as described, as well as to the working up and putting up of same.The fastening of the frontage characters is carried out by putting galvanized pins into the wall, then drilling holes in the back side of the characters, filling these with polymer lute and pushing said characters over the galvanized pins, wether at some distance from the wall or not.For steel walls, such as undulatory profiled panels, with which most modern business premises are clad nowadays, the galvanized pins are provided with blind punching nuts, which are to be affixed with special blind nut punching and clenching pincers.The invention is further explained on the basis of the enclosed figure 1, wherein a schematic cross section is shown of a frontage character as made according to the present method.In this figure the sawn out piece of slab of homogeneous and densified rigid polymer foam is 1, the layer of mineralfilled polymer emulsion plaster cured in contact with air is 2, and it comprises mineral particles 3, which render a structured surface, and W is the paint layer applied on top of it.Figure 2 demonstrates a perspective look at a frontage character according to the present invention.The frontage characters according to this invention are solid polymer objects which can be manufactured according to any specific design and in any dimension as desired.Architect offices and graphic designers can realise all their designs in accordance with the specified method of manufacture. Due to the light weight, the homogeneous structure, the attractive outward appearance and the easy to perform and reliable manner of fastening, the frontage characters according to this invention are most suitable for applications in any architectural situation. Frontage characters of the graphical type Helvetia or Eurostyle are beautiful for example, but any other types may also be manufactured by this method.Comparatory tests have been carried out with rectangular and with bent elements made in accordance with the method of manufacture as specified, and the conduct of such elements has been observed and checked under differing unfavourable weather conditions. For this purpose those elements and similar elements of wood, acrylate and glass have been put into water of 600C. and after 15 minutes quickly into ice water. The wood elements showed warpage, the acrylate elements became dull, and the elements of glass cracked, but the elements manufactured in accordance with the invention did not show any change of shape or exterior.
