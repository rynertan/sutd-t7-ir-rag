Apparatus for repositioning and adding or removing individual wires X of a series of wires extending longitudin ally in side by side relation in a row comprising a guide block 22 formed with a cruciform slot 23 defining a guide path 24 and wire escapement 25, 26 means 29, 29 to move the wires X between the guide path 24 and escapement 25, 26 and means 46, 45 to move the guide path 24 along the row to align the escapement 25, 26 with a predeter mined wire position in the row. In a method and apparatus for positioning wires, wires are fed from a supply through tubes 43 having fixed wire entry ends and wire exit ends movable to vary the position of the leading ends of the wires.
