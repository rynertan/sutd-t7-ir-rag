# Trip solenoid.

## Abstract
A case type trip solenoid is formed with a cup shaped case 11 which contains an electrical energizing coil 13 and a base 14 with a pole 15 of the base extending inwardly of the magnet, and with the base closing the open side of the case. An armature 28 is positioned within the case and extends through an opening formed in the bottom of the case, and carries a circular or annular armature plate 30 on its outer end exteriorly of the case. An annular permanent magnet 60 which is axially polarized, is positioned at the exterior surface of the bottom of the case, and carries a magnet plate 40 on its opposite surface between the magnet and the armature plate. The magnet has sufficient force to hold the armature in an energized position after power is removed from the coil.
