# CIRCULAR KNITTING MACHINE OF THE TYPE HAVING TWO NEEDLE BEDS FOR KNITTING RIB PATTERNED TUBULAR FABRICS

## Abstract
In a circular knitting machine of the type having two needle beds or needle carrying structures 1,8 for knitting plain and purl stitches, the lower needle carrying structure 1 comprises a cylinder and the upper needle carrying structure 8 has a substantially bell like shape and needle tricks 11 of arcuate shape for correspondingly arcuately bent needles 13 . The arcuately bent needles 13 are controlled by select ing jacks 12 , in turn controlled by cams 18 arranged around the substantially bell like structure 8 . Such a machine can have the same number of needles 3,13 on both needle carrying structures 1,8 , and accordingly, a higher fineness for a given diameter than traditional cylinder and dial machines. It also enables knitting loops to be transferred between all of the needles 3,13 in the two structures 1,8 , both from the purl stitch side to the plain and from the plain stitch side to the purl, thus enabling the knitting of various types of rib pattern, such as 1 1,2 2, etc., without requiring any jack replacement.
