# Sheet sorting apparatus.

## Abstract
In a sheet sorting apparatus of this invention, two main belts 60a, 60b for conveying sheets 34 run one upon anoth er through a predetermined section, and are then separated from each other so that a triangular space 82 is defined be tween them. The shape of the space 82 is determined by two separating pulleys 73a and two guide pulleys 73b . A separa tor member 106 rockable in the space 82 has a projected portion projecting between the separating pulleys 72c, 72n . When the separator member 106 is rotated, the projected portion engages one or the separating pulleys 72c, 72n in the rotating direction to restrain the rotation of the separator mem er 106 so that the sheets 34 are guided into one of collec tors 88, 90 corresponding to the rotating direction.
