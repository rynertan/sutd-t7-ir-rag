## Description
NOVEL ANTIMICROBLAL TRLAZOLE DERIVATIVES The subject invention is concerned woht 2 amino 2 phenylethyllH 1,2,4 triazoles of the formula I , as well as with their phytopharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts with inorganic and organic acids, and their metal complexes. The invention is further concerned with the preparation of such compounds, with antimicrobial compositions which contain a compound of formula I as an active ingredient, and with the use of compounds of formula I for combating plant diseases. The invention is further concerned with enamines and azomethines prepared as intermediates and with a novel method of preparing the corresponding ketones.In the formula I EMI1.1 R1 is a member selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halo, C1 C4 alkyl, C1 C4 alkyloxy, and C1 C2 haloalkyl R2 is a member sel ected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halo1 C1 C4 alkyl, C1 C4 alkyloxy, C 1 C2 haloalkyl and phenyl R3 is a member selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, C1 C12 alkyl, C3 C8 cycloalkyl which is optionally substituted with C1 C4 alkyl, and aralkyl with maximum 2 carbon atoms in the alkyl part and optionally substituted on the phenyl nucleus with halo or nitro Preferred as plant fungicides are compounds of formula I , their salts and metal complexes, wherein a R1 and R2 are both chloro, b R1 is hydrogen and R2 is phenyl, c R3 is C1 C8 alkyl, C5 C8 cycloalkyl or benzyl, optionally substituted on the phenyl nucleus with halo or nitro, and R4 is hydrogen, d R3 and R4, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached form a morpholine radical which is optionally substituted with Gl C2 alkyl. Particularly preferred are those compounds which combine the characteristics of groups a to d thus compounds of formula I wherein aa R1 and R2 are chloro, R4 is hydrogen, and R3 is C1 C8 alkyl, C5 C8 cycloalkyl or benzyl, optionally substituted on the phenyl nucleus with halo or nitro bb R1 and R2 are chloro and R3 and R4 together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached represent a morpholine ring which is optionally substituted with C1 C2 alkyl cc R1 is hydrogen, R2 is phenyl and R3 and R4 together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached represent a morpholine ring which is optionally substituted with C C1 C2 alkyl. As preferred species are to be considered 2 2,4 dichlorophenyl 2 N morpholinoethyl 1 1H 1,2,4 triazole, 2 2, 4 dichlorophenyl 2 4 chlorobenzylamino ethyl 1H 1,2,4 triazole. and 2 2,4 dichlorophenyl 2 cyclopentylaminoethyl 1 1h 1,2,4triazole. The 2 amino 2 phenylethyl 1H 1. 2,4 triazole S of the formula I are prepared, according to the invention, by the reaction of an 1H 1.2.4 triazol 1 yl acetophenone of the formula II EMI3.1 with an amine of the formula III H NR3R4 III and subsequently hydrogenating in a manner known per se the thus obtained enamine of the formulaEMI3.2 wherein R1 to R4 have the above indicated meaning, or, when R4 is hydrogen, the isomeric azomethine of the formulaEMI3.3 The compounds of the formula 1 wherein R3 is methyl or hydrogen and R4 is hydrogen, can further be prepared according to the invention by the reaction of an 1H 1,2,4 triazol 1 yl acetophenone of the formula II with formamide HCONH2 VI and subsequently hydrolysing the thus formed formamide of the formula VII EMI4.1 in a manner known per se to obtain the free amine of the formula la EMI4.2 or reducing said viz in a manner known per se into a methylamine of the formula Ib , whereby R1 and R2 have in the intermediate formulas Ia and Ib the same meaning as in formula I . The compounds of formula I can afternatively be prepared according to the invention by reacting a compound of the formula Ia , optionally in a stepwise manner, with alkylating agents of the formulas VIII and lx. R3X , R4Y VIII Ix wherein R3 and R4 have the same meaning as indicated for formula I , and X and Y are, independently from each other, leaving groups. The reaction of II with III is preferably conducted in inert organic solvents such as, for example, aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, xylene, mesitylene chlorinated hydrocarbons such as chloroform, tetrachloromethane, dichloromethane and chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzene. The condensation reaction of II with III is advantegeously carried out in the presence of a catalytic amount of a Lewis acid, such as, for example, p toluenesulfonic acid, borotrifluoride, aluminum chloride and zinc chloride. It is further advantageous to remove the water which is formed during the reaction from the reaction mixture, e.g. by azeotropic distillation or by adding a water decomposing agent. The reaction temperatures are from 50 to 200 C, preferably from 100 to 150 C. It is appropriate to heat the reaction mixture at reflux. When the compounds of formula I are obtained as bases, they may be transformed in the corresponding salts by reacting them with inorganic or organic acids, or in metal complexes of formula by their reaction with equimolar amounts of metal salts. Inversely, salts of formula I can be converted into the free bases of formula I , e.g.by their reaction with alkali hydrogencarbonate or alkali hydroxide. The enamines or azomethines of formula IV and V may be hydrogenated with elementary hydrogen, e.g. using a nobel metal contact catalyst such as palladium or platinum. Particular reducing agents for enamines are e.g. sodium cyanoborohydride, and for azomethines, e.g. sodium borohydride, .BH3. HN CH3 2 , . sodium, sodium amalgam or kathodic reduction. The compounds of formula I according to the invention possess an asymmetric centre in their carbon atom 2. Since this asymmetry emerges during a non stereospecific reaction hydrogenation , the compounds are usually available as racemates and they are used as such. In case further asymmetric centres occur in one or both of the radicals R3 and R4 there are.formed diastereomeric mixtures of compounds of formula I which may be separated into their enantiomers according to known methods. The reduction of the formamides of formula VII is advantageously carried out with lithium aluminumhydride in an inert organic solvent, such as, for example, ethers such as diethylether, dioxane and tetra hyd rofuran. As leaving groups X and Y there may be chosen halo, preferably chloro, bromo and iodo sulfonic acid radicals such as benzenesulfonic, toluenesulfonic, p bromobenzene sulfonic, methanesulfonic, trifluoromethanesulfonic sulfuric and phosphoric acid radicals. The sequence of reactions carried out ketone , enamine azo methine amine is described in the literature in J Med. Chem.12, 790 1969 and 18 531 1975 . The triazolylacetophenones of formula II , used as starting materials are partly described as fungicides in D.O.S. Nos. 2,431,407 and 2,610,022 or they may be prepared analogously. Amines of the formula III are commercially available. A further subject of the invention is that it provides a new process for the preparation of Cu lH 1,2,4 triazolyl 1 ylacetophenones of formula 11 . These compounds are obtained with both greater purity and better yield than in the process ofD.O.S. Nos. 2,431,407 and 2 610,022, when a ketal of the formula X EMI7.1 wherein R1 and R2 are as indicated for formula I andA stands for an optionally by Cl C4 alkyl substituted C2 C3 alkylene bridge, is hydrolysed in the presence of acids in a manner known per se. Appropriate acids are mineral acids such as, for example, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, hydrobromic acid or organic acids such as, formic, acetic, propionic, trinuoroacetic, methanesulfonic or toluenesulfonic acid. The starting materials of formula X areknownfrom U.S. Pat.No. 4,160,838. The enamines of formula IV and azomethines of formula V , prepared as intermediate products, are novel and possess furthermore fungicidal properties. Consequently they constitute a further feature of the subject invention. The active ingredients of formula I may be applied to surfaces or plants to be treated together with or in subsequent order with other active substances. These active substances may be fertilizers, trace element suppliers or plant growth regulating agents. They may however also be herbicides, insecticides, bactericides, nematicides, molluscicides or mixtures of such agents, optionally together with carriers, tensides or other aiding substances for the administration which are used in the formulation art. Appropriate carriers and additives in compositions according to the invention may be solid or liquid and correspond with substances usually employed in the art of formulating, such as, for example, natural or regenerated mineral substances, solvents, dispersants, wetting agents, adhesives thickeners, binders or fertilizers. As ten side are considered surface active substances which are mostly dissolved or dispersed in one liquid and which are preferably adsorbed on surfaces. A tenside molecule possesses at least one group with high affinity for highly polar substances which in general gives rise to the water solubility and at least another group with low affinity for water. Tensides are thus molecules with a lipophilic hydrophobic, i.e. water repellant or fat attractant part, usually a bridging group with alkyl and or aryl components, and additionally with a hydrophilic lipophobic, i.e. water attractant and fat repellent part, e.g. a perfluoroalkyl radical. The products usually employed in practice are mostly mixtures of such products. Tensides not only enable a fine distribution of the active substance in a liquid, e.g.aqueous medium, but also improve the wettability of the plants.This results in a reduction of the amount of active substance in the agent to be used and consequently in a lighter load on the environment. The invention comprises such agents for use in agriculture which contain at least one compound of formula I as an active substance. The preparation of agents according to the invention is performed in a manner known per se by intimately mixing and grinding the active substances of formula together with appropriate carriers and or fillers, optionally while adding inert anti ioaming agents, wetting agents, dispersants and or solubilizers. The active substances may occur in the following formulation forms and may be applied accordingly Solid forms dusts, granulates, coated granulates, impregnated and homogenous granulates Water dispersible concentrates spray powders wettable powders , pastes, emulsions, emulsifiable concentrates and suspension concentrates flowables Liquid forms solutions. The content of active substance in the above agents is from 0.1 to 95 , preferably from 1 to 80 . The forms may be diluted from there to 0.001 . The employed doses are in general from 0.01 to 10 kg of active substance pro ha, preferably 0. 025 to 5 kg ha. In the following examples temperatures are indicated in centigrades. Parts and percentages relate to weight, pressures are indicated in millibar mb 1 mb 100 Pascal .Examples of chemical preparation Example I a Preparation of intermediate.EMI9.1 compound 210 2 2, 4 dichlorophenyl 2 4 chlorobenzyl imino ethyl 1 1 H 1 4 triazole.

Example IXEmulsifiable concentrates the following substances are used to prepare a 25 emulsifiable concentrate 25 parts of active substance 2. 5 parts of epoxidised vegetable oil 10 parts of an alkylarylsulfonate fatty alcohol polyglycol ether mixture 5 parts of dimethyl formamide 57. 5 parts of dimethylbenzene.By diluting such a concentrate with water it is possible to prepare emulsions of the desired concentration, which are especially suitable for leaf application.Example XActivity against Puccinia graminis on wheat.a Residual protective action Wheat plants where sprayed 6 days after sowing with a spray broth 0. 06 of active substance prepared from a wettable powder of the active substance. After 24 hours the treated plants were infected with a suspension of Uredospores of the fungus.After an incubation period of 48 hours at 95 100 relative humidity and at about 20 C the plants were stood in a greenhouse at approx. 22 C. The development of rust pustules was evaluated 12 days after the infection.The compounds of formula I were fully active. At the low concentra tion of 0. 002 ,compounds 15,24 and 40 inter alia were still fully active.b Systemic action 5 Days after sowing wheat plants are sprayed with a spray broth containing 0. 006 of active substance the amount of the spray being proportional with the soilvolume prepared from Åa wettable powder of the active substance. After 48 hours the treated plants are infected with a suspension of Uredospores of the fungus. After an incubation period of 48 hours at 95 100 relative humidity and at 20 C the treated plants are stood in a glass house at about 22 C. The rust pustules are evaluated 12 days after the day of infection. Part of the compounds of formula I , e.g. compounds 2, 3, 5, 15 and 40 completely prevented fungal disease through their systemic action.Certain compounds of formula I , e.g. compounds. 3, 5 and 15 completely prevented fungal attack even at concentrations as low as 0. 0006 , Example XI Activity against Cercospora personata C. arachidicola on peanut plants .3 week old peanut plants were sprayed with a spray 0.02 of the active substance prepared from a wettable powder of the active principle. After about 12 h the treated plants were dusted with a conidium suspension of the fungus. The infected plants were incubated for about 24 h at 90 relative humidity and then placed in a greenhouse at about 22 C. The incidence of the fungus infection was evaluated after 12 days.In comparison with the untreated controls, plants that had been treated with the active principles of formula I displayed little or no fungal infestation. Compounds 2, 3, 24 and 40, inter alia, completely prevented the disease at a concentration of 0. 02 . Compounds 3 and 24 completely prevented fungal attack at a concentration of 0.002 also.Example XIIActivity against Erysiphe graminis on barley.a Residual protective action Barley plants, about 8 cm in height, are sprayed with a spray broth containing 0.02 of active substaiice prepared from a wettable powder of the active substance. After 3 4 hours the treated plants are dusted with conidia of the fungus. The infected barley plants are then placed in a glass house at about 22 C and fungal attack is evaluated 10 days after the day of infection.
