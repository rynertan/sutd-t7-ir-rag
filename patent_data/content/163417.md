# Bleach products.

## Abstract
A bleach product for use in the washing machine as an adjunct to a normal detergent powder or liquid comprises a closed bag containing a particulate bleach composition, the bag being formed of sheet material having pores large enough to render it water permeable but small enough to confine the bleach composition within the bag. The bleach composition comprises sodium perborate with an activator such as tetraacetyl ethylenebiamine or sodium octanoyloxy benzene sulphonate. Preferably at least 25 mole per cent of the perborate is in monohydrate form this gives reduced malodour development on short storage.
