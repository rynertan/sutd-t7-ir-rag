## Description
Foam composition for treating textile materialsThis invention relates to the field of treating textile fabrics ith fabric finishing agents, and more particu larly,to foamable compositions for applying fabric finishing agents to textile products.Conventionally, treatment of textile fabrics with finishing aent3, e.., coloring agents or dyes, resins, and the like, has involved a procedure wherein the finishing agent is eitner dissolved or dispersed in a suitable li quid meiiiurn, such as an aqueous or organic liquid, and then the mixture of the finishing agent and liquid medium are applied to the fabric. Thereafter, the carrier is removed from the fabric, usually by evaporation with or without heat.It ist further conventional to use small amounts of the finishing agents relative to the amount of liquid mEdium in order to conserve the amount of the finishing accent use. This produces relatively large amounts of li uid medium which must be removed from the fabric. Consequently, a substantial amount of the cost incurred in such processes resides in the liquid medium removal step. Such liquid media present a further problem in that after removal, the liquid must either be disposed of or reco vered for re use. In the case of an aqueous treatment system wherein the liquid media is water, the water is normally disposed of as waste. In recent years, the environmental problems associated with the disposal of the water and residual finishing agents therein have become increasingly prevelant.With respect to organic solvents as the liquid medium, it is normally desirable to recover them because of their relatively high cost. Recovery systems for this procedure add to the expense of the overall treatment process.Moreover, disposal of the solvent, if it is not recovered, may cause environmental contamination.The foregoing problems become even more pronounced when treating textile fabrics which are highly absorbent. Thus, for example, when it is desired to treat or finish pile fabrics, e.g., carpeting, sliver knit fabrics, and the like, the fabrics have a tendency to absorb great quantities of the water or organic solvent, thus making the liquid removal step even more difficult and expensive.Additionally, because of the relatively large absorption of the liquid, the weight of the wet fabric which is being handled increases significantly.In the co pending application of R.S. Gregorian and C.G.Namboodri, Serial No. 584,389, filed June 6, 1975, there is described a novel process for the application of fabric finishing agents to textile fabrics which substantially reduces the large amount of liquid medium utilized in conventional processes. The amount of finishing agent required to produce the desired finishing effect on the fabric, is incorporated in a foamable composition capable of forming a stable foam having a blow ratio in the range of from about 2 1 to about 20 1. The composi tion is converted to a foam and coated onto the fabric and is thereafter compressed, padded and or vacuumed to achieve penetration of the foam through the fabric. The so treated fabric is then dried and, if necessary, cured or fixed in a conventional manner.Although the rocess of the above described application represents a significant advance in the textile treatment arts, further improvement may be achieved, such as in the nature ot this rtic lar composition to be used. For instance as was the case with liquid media systems, the use of e.eceW carrier medium is undesirall . Thus, in a foamabLe o. osition, usage of excess foaming agent results in an additional cost factor and may have adverse effects on finish durability.Likewise, further improvement may be achieved in the control of the foaming step and in the desire to reduce the cost of shipping, storage and the like necessarily associated with foamable compositions which typically contain large amounts of water or other liquid medium. SULNILMARY OF THE INVENTIONBriefly stated, the present invention is directea to a foamable composition for treating fabrics with a finishiny agent and which is capable of being formed into a foam which is sufficiently stable to substantially retain its characteristics during application. Included in the composition is an amount of fabric finishing agent sufficient to impart the desired finish to the fabric. A foaming system, consisting of a foaming agent and optionally a foam stabilizer and thickener, each or both in combination with the foaming agent, in an amount up to 10 percent is included, the ratio of active solids to that of foaming agent being at least 8 1. Preferably, the ratio is between 1o 1 and 2000 1. Further, it is preferred that the amount of foaming agent is less than 2.o percent.With a minimum amount of foaming agent in the composition, adverse effects of finish durability such as those caused by excessive foaming agent, are avoided.Further, costs are reduced in that excess foaming agent is avoided which not only reduces the composition cost but also eliminates the need to employ additional means to remove the excess foaming agent from the fabric.According to another aspect of the invention, the composi .tion is provided as a concentrate capable of forming a stable foam upon stirring the concentrate with a liquid medium added thereto. The concentrate composition is an intimate admixture of a foaming agent and a thickening agent.The substantially liquid free foam precursor composition enables greatly reduced storage and shipping costs owing to the vastly decreased bulk of the compositions as compared to liquid containing foamable compositions. Moreover, the substantially liquid free compositions possess the advantage of precluding any physical or chemical change in the foamable composition which might otherwise result in liquid compositions permitted to stand for any substantial time after preparation and prior to foaming. Still further, the compositions permit more controlled and varied foaming than liquid containing compositions in that the ultimate foam blow ratio and density and other properties may be varied correlatively by variation of the amount of liquid medium added to the composition before stirring.In accordance with this invention, foaming agents which may be utilized include materials selected from the fol lowing groups of compounds.

Foam stabilizers may also be used in conjunction with the noted foaming agents to obtain added foam stability.Auxiliary foam stabilizers include lauryl alcohol, sodium laurate, lower aliphatic alcohols, dodecyl alcohol, lower aliphatic acids, lauric acid, fatty acids, hydrophilic polymers, such as, agar, polyvinyl alcohol and sodium alginate and blends of these compounds.Suitable thickeners for admixture with the foaming agent or stabilizer in order to form a paste like mass therewith include polyacrylic acid, copolymers of acrylic acid, polyvinyl alcohol, natural gums, starches, starch deri vatives, cellulose derivatives, synthetic polymeric compounds, water soluble polymers, organic solvent soluble polymers and blend of these compounds. Preferred among these thickeners are cellulosic derivatives such as methylcellulose, hydroxethylcellulose, and the like. When using the concentrate, the thickener and foaming agent are pre pasted in ratios which may vary widely according to the desired characteristics of the foam ultimately obtained. In general, suitable mixtures are prepared with about 10 90 by weight thickener to about 90 10 foam stabilizer, preferably in weight ratios of 25 1 to about 3 1 foam stabilizer to thickener.Additional materials such as emulsifiers, pH adjusting additives such as acids or bases, and the like may be added to the paste like concentrate. The textile finishing agents themselves, such as dyes, water repellents, antistats, weighting agents etc. may also be incorporated with the thickener and foaming agent in forming the paste like foamable precursor concentrate.One of the advantages of adding the finishing agent du ring the foaming step is the ability to utilize the thickener foaming agent precursor composition as a universal carrier system for all such textile finishing agents. Thus, any desired finishing agent may simply be added to the composition along with the addition of liquid medium and then stirred or whipped into a foam for application to textile fabrics.Typical liquid media which may be added to the concentrate composition to form a foam include water, perchloroethylene, methanol, trichloroethylene, and.other conventional solvents, e.g., chlorinated hydrocarbons and aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon and petroleum solvents.Generally, the composition of the present invention, after the addition of liquid medium, is capable of being stirred or whipped into a foam having a blow ratio in the range from about 2 1 to 20 1, and preferably, from about 2 1 to lol. The blow ratio is determined by measuring the weight of a given volume of a foam compared to the weight of the same volume of the composition prior to foaming. The foam density range is generally from about o,5 gm cc to o,o5 gm cc and preferably, from about o,5 to o,1 gm cc.Upon the addition of a liquid medium to the paste like foam concentrate or precursor, the resulting foamable composition typically contains from about o,o1 to 10 by weight of foaming agent, up to 5 and preferably, .o1 to 5 thickener, to which is added from up to about 95 hy weight of the appropriate fabric finishing agent.In order to be suitable for use in treating textile materials, it is important that the foam be sufficiently stable so that it does not collapse between the time when the initial foaming takes place and the time when it is introduced into the fabric. Moreover, the amount of foaming agent present in the composition is important. As indicated, it is preferred that the amount of foam in the composition is less than 2.o percent and the ratio of active solids to foaming agent be in the range of 15 1 to 2000 1. This insures a uniform application of the finishing agent without any adverse effects as to the durability of the finish.Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide a foamable composition suitable for treating fabrics with a finishing agent, the treated fabric possessing a finish of suitable durability.It is another object of this invention to provide a foamable composition for treating fabrics with a finishing agent in which the amount of foaming agent with respect to solid materials is suitable for effective treatment of textile fabrics with finishing agent.It is a further object of this invention to provide a foam composition for treating fabrics with a finishing agent which reduces shipping, storage and associated costs.It is a still further object of this invention to provide a foam composition for treating fabrics with a finishing agent in the form of concentrate capable of forming a stable foam upon stirring the concentrate with a liquid medium added thereto.
