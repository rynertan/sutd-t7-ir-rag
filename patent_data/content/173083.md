## Abstract
In a method for producing data concerning a fault in an AC electric power system, an AC electric quantity is sam pled at a frequency which is a multiple of the rated frequen cy of the AC electric quantity, and is stored, for later use as predicted values, and an arithmetic operation is performed on the sample values to produce a data concerning a fault in the power system. The predicted values are determined by the following equation
