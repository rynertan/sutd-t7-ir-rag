# A semiconductor integrated circuit device with an improved heat sink.

## Abstract
A semiconductor device comprises a common heat sink 1 joined to a plurality of IC packages 2 mounted on a mother board 6 , the common heat sink comprising a base board portion 10 , a heat conducting shaft portion 11 arranged perpendicular to the base board portion and a plurality of heat dissipating fins 3 arranged perpendicular to the heat conducting shaft portion and parallel to each other. The common heat sink has one or more slits 12 formed parallel to the heat conducting shaft and extending from the base board portion, the common heat sink being joined 2b to the plurality of IC packages at sections of the base board portion divided by the slits. The slits prevent the heat sink from causing too much thermal stress on the joins 2b . An alternative common heat sink comprises a plurality of fins each perpendicular to a base portion, with slits formed perpendicular to the fins this sink and its associ ated IC packages are suitably mounted on opposite faces of the mother board. The common heat sink is more efficient and robust than individual ones for each IC package.
