The invention includes a forming line providing for movement of lightweight fibrous furnish for delivery to and distribution over a preselected area to contin uously form a mat of such furnish for compaction and curing into fiberboard, comprising a device for contin uously feeding lightweight fibrous furnish into the forming line, conveyor means located downstream from and Ln vertically spaced relation to the furnish feeding device and presenting an elongated support web and including means for controllably moving the elongated support web to present a surface of preselected area for deposition of furnish the controlled movement of the elongated support web establishing a forming direction for the mat being formed, a device for moving furnish continuously fed into the forming line trans tersely to the direction of movement of furnish toward the support web and for continuously discharging furnish in the direction of the support web distributed over one dimension of the preselected area of deposition, a flow through header chamber for receiving furnish distributed over such one dimension of the selected area of deposition and confining such furnish to a fractional portion of the remaining dimension of the preselected area of deposition, a metering device for continuously removing furnish from such header chamber in the direction of the support web, a device mechanically contacting such metered furnish to accelerate movement of such furnish in the direction of the support web, means for uniformly distributing such furnish over the remaining dimension of the preselecte area of deposition while maintaining such initial distribution of furnish in such one dimension, the means for distributing furnish over the remaining dimension providing mechanical contact with such furnish and imparting a component of movement to the furnish transverse to its direction of movement towards the support web along the remaining dimension of distribution to continuously deliver furnish uniformly distributed over substantially the full selected area of deposition. A lightweight disc refined fibrous furnish can be handled by the method and apparatus of the invention without relying on pneumatic impulsion for movement of such furnish to achieve commercially acceptable flow rates. Air turbulence effects are substantially eliminated while providing for uniform distribution and deposition of the lightweight furnish, Commercially economic production rates of fiberboard are made practicable while enabling desired orientation of fibers by means of an electric.field. The invention is further described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a schematic view in elevation, with portions cut away, of apparatus embodying the invention Figure 2 is a schematic cross sectional view in elevation of the apparatus of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a larger scale view of a portion of the apparatus of Figure 2 Figure 4 is a view of a flow splitter device taken along the line 4 4 of Figure 3 Figure 5 is a view of a damper venting device, taken along the line 5 5 of Figure 3 Figure 6 is a view of a shroud control device taken along the line 6 6 of Figure 3 Figure 7 is a fragmentary view taken along the line 7 7 of Figure 6 and Figure 8 is a view taken along the line 8 8 ofFigure 7. In carrying out the present invention, continuous over feed of furnish into the processing line eliminates possible problems associated with interrupted or cyclic movement of particulate material, bulk density changes in the material, or surges related to pneumatic transport of furnish to the inlet for the forming line, In a specific embodiment of the invention for handling lightweight fibrous furnish, cyclone 10 ofFigures 1 and 2 is provided to separate air when pneumatic flow is used for transporting fibrous material from blended fiber bin 12 Figure 1 to such cyclone hopper means.The furnish is fed continuously..from cyclone 10 into the distribution and deposition equip merit. The furnish is first distributed over one dimension of the mat being formed as shown, in the cross direction i.eO perpendicular to the mat forming direction for the line, The furnish from cyclone 10 is fed at a rate in excess of the mat deposition rate. Bidirectional feed screw 14 moves the furnish across the lateral dimension which is correlated with, and preferably approximately equal to, the lateral dimension of the mat being formed, Discharge of furnish in the forward direction, .e. towards the mat being formed, from the bidirectional screw 14 is uniform across the selected dimension.Flop rates 16 and 18 at the discharge opening of cyclone 10 are adjusted so that the quantity of furnish overflowing from the ends of bidirectional screw is equal.Excess furnish is returned to bin 12 from ends of the bidirectional feed screw 14 through vacuum return conduits 20 and 22. The laterally distributed furnish moves in the forward direction into a flow through chamber 24 shown partially cut away, with a viewing glass 25, in Figure 1 which functions as a metering bin for the furnish.lateral distribution is maintained in the flow through chamber 24 by providing a lateral dimension which is correlated with, and preferably substantially equal to, the lateral dimension of the mat being formed. The furnish is accumulated to a uniform height across the lateral dimension of flow through chamber 24. The continuous flow feature made available at this stage by continuously feeding furnish in excess of that to be distributed while returning excess enables a constant head of furnish to be maintained in chamber 24 without on offtl controls. This provides more accurate metering while maintaining the continuous flow for avoiding the handling problems previously encountered with lightweight furnish. Flow through chamber 24 includes a profiling chamber 26 at its discharge end which establishes a configuration for the furnish which facilitates metering. Profiling chamber 26 presents a discharge opening having 2 lateral dimension substantially equal to that of the laterally distributed furnish.One purpose of the profiling chamber 26 is to control.and maintain uniform fiberweighk over the distributed dimension,In the illustrated embodiment, the initial distribution is in the cross machine direction therefore, the profile of the furnish in the machine forming direction is confined to a fractional portion of the machineforming dimension established for mat forming deposition of furnish Compression of the furnish in the machineforming direction is controlled, e.g0 by adjustable baffle structure 28, 30 Figures 2 and 3 located along each extended length sidewall internally of the profiling chamber0 Individually adjustable baffles, such as 32 Figure 1 , are aligned to adjust the profile.Baffle adjusters, such as 34, 36 are connected to each such baffle. Baffles 33 and 40 at the ends of profiling chamber 26, which are adjustable by means of lateral adjusters 42, 44, maintain the lateral distribution dimension for proper feeding into the next element in the line0 Profiling chamber 26 leads into metering chamber 48 Figures 2 and 3 . Detering rolls 50, 52 Figure 3 are disposed in chamber 48 with their longitudinal axes of rotation extending along the dimension of distributed furnish. Contact surfaces of the metering rolls 50, 52 establish a cross sectional periphery which extends to boundaries of the discharge opening established within the profiling chamber 26.Such contact surfaces.positively grip the furnish, compressing the furnish in a preselected manner which facilitates metering while moving the furnish in the forward direction. Mitering nip 54 is defined by the metering rolls 50, 52 to have a preselected cross sectional area,Rotation of. metering rolls 50, 52 is continuous with the speed being controlled to move the furnish in the forward direction at a uniform controlled rate without relying on pneumatic impulsion, Scalping roll 56 is positioned below the metering nip 54o The weight of the furnish column extending upwardly through the metering nip 54 and into chamber 24 is partially supported.by positioning of the scalping roll 56 in the flow path from the metering rolls, generally slightly off center of such flow path.A slot 58 for adjustable positioning of scalping roll 56 is shown by dotted line. Such furnish column support provides better metering control by enabling the furnish to remain under the control of the metering rolls 50, 52 in the metering nip 54. Also, haphazard break up of the controlled configuration furnish after exits from the metering nip 54 is avoided, The furnish is delivered in a controlled manner avoiding irregular falling or avalanching of furnish into the next downstream element. The speed of the scalping roll 56 is controlled to provide a high peripheral velocity. Impingement on scalping roll 56 not only provides for uniform forward movement of the furnish but also provides forward momentum of lightweight furnish for main taining desired production flow rate through the processing line during subsequent distribution over the full area of deposition. The high peripheral velocity of the scalping roll 56 is imparted to the controllably metered furnish. Thus, accurate meter ing control of a relatively slow moving compressed furnish column is obtained at rolls 50, 52 while enabling acceleration after metering. It has been found that the high velocity imparted to the furnish by the scalping roll 56 after the relative low velocity novement through the metering rolls 50, 52 can create a needw for replacement air as the furnish is suddenly accelerated, In order to avoid air flowing countercurrent to the forward direction of movement of the furnish, air hatches are provided to allow outside air to enter the former shell 59 Fig. 2 and interior sub structure, Such entry of air is at a location removed from the mat being formed so as to avoid ar.y.air turbulence effect on the mat or any orientation function. Entry of air into outer shell 59 of the former is through air hatches 60, 62 Figures 2 and 3 . Air access into the scalper roll area is controlled by damper means 6 Figure 3 which includes a plurality of individual air dampers, such as 66, 68 Figure 5 distributed along the lateral dimension0 Damper adjustment means 70 Figure 3 provide for damper adjustment from externally of the forming line shell 59 each damper, such as 66, 68, can include such an adjustment means for uniform air admission across the distributed dimension. The furnish as delivered from the scalping roll 56 is moving In the forward direction at a velocity substantially equal to the peripheral velocity of the scalping roll, A chute structure is formed within the former shell 59 to properly direct furnish for distribution over the remaining dimension of deposition.This chute structure can include a cleaning plate associated with each feeder roll. As shown in Figure 3, cleaning plate 72 for metering roll 50 and cleaning plate 74 for metering roll 52 are adjustably mounted to control contact with each metering roll. This cleaning action preserves the gripping strength of the metering rolls by eliminating fiber build up. The chute structure includes sidewalls 76, 78 Figure 3 leading to the inlet side of means for distributing furnish over the remaining dimension of mat deposition0 A furnish flow splitter device 80 Figure 3 is located in the chute downstream of the metering rolls in the direction of further distribution means, The high velocity, longitudinally confined furnish is directed to distribution means which spread the confined furnish over the full area of deposition,This distribution means controllably reduces forward velocity of the furnish while maintaining the desired constant weight per unit time movement of furnish. The initial distribution of the furnish which is maintained in the flow through chamber 24 and during metering, is also maintained during distribution of the furnish in the machine f orming direction, i.eO over the longitudinal dimension of the mat being formed.Contact of the furnish with the scalping roll 56 initiates the uniform break up of the metering configduration and imparts desired forward movement to the furnish without relying on pneumatic pressure. After contact with scalping roll 56, the furnish is directed towards longitudinal distribution means 82. Distribution rolls 83 to 88 are arranged in banks to impart a horizontal component of movement to and to move the furnish between and about the distribution brush rolls. Uniform longitudinal distribution is provided along with controlled movement of furnish in the forward direction over substantially the full preselected area of deposition for forming a mat. In the embodiment shown, the banks of distribution brush rolls are arranged, when viewed axially, to form sides of a triangular configuration having an apex portion pointed in the direction of the scalping roll 56. The base or remaining side of the triangle, opposite to such apex portion, extends over substantially the full longitudinal dimension of the area of deposition and is disposed in the direction of the mat to be formed. This arrangement provides for uniform longitudinal distribution Also movement in the forward direction can be carried out substantially free of pneumatically imparted velocity so as to provide for fiber orientation by means of an electrical field. The high forward velocity imparted by the scalping roll 56 is controlled by the longitudinal distribution brush rolls 83 to 88.A longitudinal movement, transverse to the forward direction, is a parted so that discharge from the brush rolls in the forward direction is controlled. Also, the interaction of the longitudinal distribution brush rolls helps to break up large camps of furnish which might exist. For uniformity of distribution purposes, it is preferred to have substantially equal portions of the furnish be handled by each half of the distribution means 82. The splitter 80 is adjustably mounted to provide the desired diversion of furnish, As can be visualized from the detailed view of the splitter 80.in Figure 4, baffle structures such as 92, 93 direct a portion of the furnish towards the distribution roll 83 and the open portions such as 90,91 direct the remaining portion of the furnish towards the distribution roll 84. The distribution brush rolls 83, 84 can be adjustably positioned by means of the slots 100, 101 shown in dotted lines in Figure 3. Shroud structure 102, 104 partially surrounds distribution rolls 83, 84,, respectively.Each shroud structure includes a plurality of vanes and adjustment means. The vane structure can be moved towards and away from the axis.of the distribution brush rolls 83 and 84 by slotted adjustment arms 110 and 11 2e The vanes help guide the moving furnish to maintain, or adjust for, uniformity in the lateral dimension distribution. Each of the plurality of vanes along the lateral dimension can be made adjustable for this purpose.For example, vane 116 shown in detail in Figure 7 is adjustable so that its end portion 118 moves in a laterally oriented arc, with respect to the mat being formed, by pivoting about axi 3 120. Adjustment control 122 with positive lock means 124 is shown in detail in Figure 8.Various adjus ted positions of the plurality of vanes, along the axial length of a distribution roll, are shown by dotted lines in Fissure 6. he longitudinalinension of distribution provided by distribution means 82 and the longitudinal dimension of the preselected arita of deposition are correlated preferably they are Cibstantially equal. In this way, the distributed furnish moves in the forward direction through the remainder of the processing line over the full cross sectional irea selected and established for deposition.This suitantially eliminates furnish flow problems and also hells eliminate the introduction of extraneous forces which can result from changing the cross sectional area of the flow path, or the direction of the flow path, in approaching deposition. A commercially acceptable continuous flow rate can be maintained for lightweight fibrous furnish while allowing adequate space and time for fiber separation and orientation. The furnish, as discharged from the longitudinal distribution means 82 is moving forward over the full area of intended deposition.The uniformly distributed furnish is delivered by the longitudinal distribution means 82 into screening chamber 130 Figure 2 . A screening means 132 within chamber 130 extends over substantially the full area of deposition, Small clusters of fibers which may remain in lightweight fibrous furnish are separated in the screening means to deliver discrete fibers workable screening means are known in the. art and can include a plurality of closely spaced wires extending longitudinally over an area at least equal to that selected for deposition of fibrous material. The cross sectional area transverse to the direction of furnish flow of orientation chamber 140 Figure 3 is substantially equal to the area of deposition. The furnish is deposited on a surface presented by a con tinuously moving support web 142. The mat formed on support web 142 is moved into apparatus not shown for compaction and curing under pressure and heat to form the end product fiberboard. The support web 142 can be an endless belt, moving in the direction of arrow 144, guided and driven by rolls such as 146, 147. This forming conveyor surface is preferably foraminous. In place of the usual bronze fourdrinier wire, support web 142 can be formed from filament having desired dielectric properties when electrical orientation is used e.g. the support web 142 can be woven from nylon filament. For purposes of reducing random dust escape from the forming line shell when working with lightweight fibrous furnish, the pressure can be maintained slightly negative beneath the support web 142 by any suitable suction means. Butterfly valves 150, 151, 152 and compartmenting can be provided to distribute and extend a slight negative pressure to the peripheries of the structure. A negative pressure of about 62.3 Pa 0.25 of water is recommended to help reduce ambient dust while not adversely affecting orientation when working with fine fibers. access of air to the forming line shell is provided at a removed location, e.g. through the dampers 60 62 to avoid possible adverse effects of incoming air on the mat. Thus,in rushof air as the mat exits from the forming chamber is substantially eliminated even when negative pressures greater than recommended to reduce ambient dust are utilized. Also, the negative pressure in a chamber 156 can be adjusted to help con solidate the mat upon or after exit from the mat forming area. In a chamber 158, the negative pressure should be strong enough to help prevent fracture as the mat is transferred from the continuous filament web 142 onto d belt 160 for transport to a press. The combination of elements described moves the furnish continuously without interruption of forward movement through the process line with no need to rely on pneumatic impulsion for movement of lightweight fibrous furnish. Furnish uniformly distributed over the full area of deposition is moved along a flow path which is normal to the area of deposition. In working with furnish which is to be directionally oriented, this flow path is provided prior to entry into the orientation chamber 140. This permits effective orientation at commercially economical production rates of lightweight furnishes in an electric field. Referring to Fig, 3 which shows the metering section, the profiling chamber 26 establishes the dimensions and positioning of furnish discharge which is correlated with the dimension and positioning of the metering rolls 50 and 52. One of the metering rolls can be adjustably positioned horizontally, via dotted line slot 162, to assist in proper alignment. The metering rolls 50, 52 rotate about their longitudinal axe 3 164 and 166, as indicated by the arrows 168 and 170. The metering rolls 50, 52 are formed from materials which possess the necessary characteristics for positive gripping of the furnish, compression the furnish, and controlling forward movement without shearing the column of material being formed and metered through metering nip 54. In working with lightweight pressure refined wood furnish, the compression ratio imPosed by the metering rolls 50,52 should not be substant ally greater than 4 1. That is, the cross sectional area of the f urnish as delivered from the profiling chamber, measureS in a plane perpendicularly transverse to the direction of movement of the furnish, should not be greater than about four times the cross sectional area, similarly measured, of metering nip 54. Since one dimension is being held substantially constant as sho v.m the lateral dimension , the remaining dimension as shown the longit urinal dimension is selected and controlled to effect the desired compression, In practice, when working with the pressure refined wood fibers of br.e specific embodiment, the ratio should be in the range of 2 1 to about 3 1. With the selected compression ratio and metering roll of selected characteristics, the furnish will be compressed into the proper configuration for accurate metering and steady movement without shearing of the furnish column. Selected bristle materials provide satisfactory surface characteristics for the metering rolls. Moisture absorption properties should be considered in selecting bristle materials for the metering rolls, scalping roll, and distribution brush rolls. Furnish may be premixed. with curable resin binders which can be in liquid form. Also, moisture content of the fibrous material can vary dependent on ambient conditions, previous handling, and cdnditioning practices.By selecting bristle material of low moisture absorption properties, e.g. about 5 by weight or less, accumulation of resin on the brush rolls is avoided.Polypropylene, which exhibits moisture absorption of about 2 , by weight, is preferred for this purpose.The bristle material should also be capable, by suitable roll assembly techniques, of exhibiting other desired characteristics. Bristles for metering rolls 50, 52 should be short in length, e.g. about 51 mm two itches on a roll having a diameter of approximately 406 mm sixteen inches , wi th the bristles tightly wound, spirally.These rolls are driven by a variable speed drive so the speed of the metering rolls can be adjusted to meet mat basis weight and production speeds. The metering rolls 50, 52 rotate at a relatively low speed, typically about three RPM, in handling lightweight furnish. The controlled flow of the metered furnish from nip 54 impinges on scalping roll 56 rotating in the direction shown by arrow 172 in Figure 2. Scalping roll 56 rotates about its axis 174 which is laterally oriented axis 174 is aligned with and substantially parallel to the axes 164 and 166 of metering rolls 50 and 52. The periphery of the roll 56 should provide the desired scalping action. Bristles tightly wound spirally, i.e. in a spiral or helical curve, provide the desired action. Scalping roll 56 is rotated to provide a high peripheral velocity of about 10.3 m s 1 to 18.3 m s 1 200 fpm to 3600 fpm in a representative embodiment working with lightweight furnish. The distribution roll brushes rotate about their respective axes which are laterally oriented and aligned in parallel relationship with axes of the scalping roll 56, the metering rolls 50, 52, and with each other. Direction of rotation, as shown inFigure 3, is selected to aid uniformity of distribution.The upper distribution rolls 83, 84 rotate to impose a horizontal component of motion which is outwardly directed with relation to the triangular configuration formed by the banks of distribution brushes the two bottom rolls 87,88 may rotate inwardly to prevent furnish from striking the leading and trailing ends of the distribution chamber. The speed of revolution of each roll can be set to suit fiber geometry and flow rate. The distribution brushes are preferably formed from spaced, axially extending, parallel, rows of bristles distributed about their peripheries as shown in. Figure 3. Referring to Figure 1. the cyclone flop gates 16, 18 are pivotally mounted and establish substantially equal flow in both lateral directions of bidirectional screw 14 which is driven by motor 180. Metering rolls 50, 52, scalping roll 56, and distribution brush rolls 83 to 88 are supported at their respective long itudinal ends providing drive connections. .Referring to Figure 2, from shaker screen chamber 130J in which the shaker screen is vibrated by drive 182, a furnish with individualized fibers passes through a drop zone forming part of orientation chPmber 140. The fibers can be oriented by an electrical field established by a bank 184 of electrically conductive rods. The above described handling methods and apparatus are applicable to furnishes including wood shavings and flakes as well as lightweight comminuted fibrous furnishes produced by disc refining of wood pieces.Furnishes produced by pressurized steam refining of wood particles have, in the past, presented difficult handling problems which impeded economical production rates. Therefore, while the invention as described above is.generally applicable to particulate furnishes for manufacture of composition board, specific data will be presented on what has been considered the most difficult to handle furnish. Pressure refined wood comprises, for the most part, extremely fine hair like fibers of less than one mil in diameter, generally from about 6f3 mm to about 12.6 mm 1 4 to 1 2 inch in length but extending up to 18.9 mm 3 4 inch , A significant portion by weight comprises splinter like pieces of varying length about 6.3 mm to 12.6 mm and, the remainder is dust like. This furrish generally exhibits agglomerating characteristics similar to those of cotton fibers. The flow rates achieved in carrying out the invention with this material have significance. For example, in a representative specific embodiment, in excess 22.6 kg s 300 pounds per minute of pressure refined wood fiber furnish, having a bulk density of about 28.0 kgm t 3 4 pounds per cubic foot ,can be uniformly distributed to provide a deposition rate 2 1 four pound per of about 00325 kg m s four pounds per square foot per minute over a preselected area on the support web of approximately 6096 m 2 seventy five square feet .With the forming conveyor support web 142 moving at a linear speed of 0.254 m s 1 fifty feet per minute , the end . product after compaction and curing under pressure and heat, will have 2 thickr.ess 3.17 mm 1 8 of an inch at a density of 800 kg m 3 fifty pounds per cubic foot at linear speed of 0.127 m s 1 twenty five feet per minute for the support web, the Panel will have z thickness of 6.35 mm 1 4 inch after compaction and curing. Utilizing the over feed system for continuous flow handling, the bidirectional feed screw will be rotated at about fifty 50 RE I metering rolls of 406 mm sixteen inches diameter are operator controlled and rotate at about three 3 RPM a 254 mm ten inches . diameter scalping roll rotates at about 750 to 1000 RPM, and 406 mm sixteen inches diameter distribution rolls rotate at an average of about 500 RPM.The speed of the operator controlled distribution rolls can vary between 250 and about 750 RRI dependent upon character istics of.tr.e furnish, including moisture contents The drive motor for the shaker screen is operated to provide cyclic vibrations for the screening wires dependent on the materials, e.g. about 1000 per minutes Furnish flow and uniform distribution can be provided at forming density deposition rates determined by available capacity of the curing and pressing fac ility.Where the flow rates available with the method and apparatus of the present invention exceed,available curing and pressing capacities at a particular site , it is preferred to utilize optimum continuous flow rates for the particular forming line, which can exceed 0.407 kg m 2 s 1 five lbs ft2 minute for lightweight furnish,as meas ured at the area of deposition furnish deposition above available curing capacity can be shaved off before pressing and returned to the input side of the line. Suitable resin binder systems using urea formaldehyde, phenol formaldehyde, isocyanate, and tannin formaldehyde are well known in the art as are the techniques for proper addition of the resin and for curing. Along with the principles of operation, physical values such as weights of furnish handled, dimensions, configuration, placement of structures, and rotary or linear movement of various elements have been set forth in describing commercially practical process line methods and apparatus. In the specific embodiment shown, the lateral dimension has been described for the initial distribution step while the furnish is confined in the longitudinal direction for metering.In the light of this disclosure, modifications can be made in these physical values. Also, while final distribution over the dimension in the machine forming direction as shown is preferred, distribution over this dimension could be taken up first while utilizing the described principles of metering and controlled continuous flow.
