# Surface preparation of ceramic substrates for metallization.

## Abstract
A process for preparing a ceramic substrate for metalli zation is claimed wherein a surface of the ceramic substrate is contacted with an admixture comprised of an inert solid material and a composition containing one or more alkali metal compounds. The admixture and the substrate are heated at least to a temperature at which the alkali metal composition becomes molten. The molten alkali metal composition is kept in contact with the ceramic surface for a time period sufficient to etch the surface and thus prepare it for adherent deposition of metal. The presence of the inert solid material in the admixture prevents coalescence of the alkali metal composition on the ceramic surface. Uniform surface coverage with catalyst and metal and an adherent bond of metal to the ceramic surface are ensured by treatment with the admixture. Furthermore, an article com prised of metal directly and adherently bonded onto a ceramic substrate is provided.
