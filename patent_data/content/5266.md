# Hemodialysis apparatus.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a portable dialysis apparatus of the type comprising a first blood circuit and a second circuit for the ultrafiltrate and the dialysis liquid. The exchange between the blood and the dialysis liquid is taking place through a semipermeable membrane. Both the blood circuit and the second circuit include a drawing and circulation pump of the type in which a flexible tube is periodically throttled by a member of the pump head. The pump of the dialysis liquid is having the suction side in communication with the outlet of the dialyzer either through a supply tank of dialysis liquid or directly through a shunt line. Its delivery side is in communication either with the inlet of the dialyzer or with an ultrafiltrate collecting bag. A pressure measuring device is inserted upstream of the pump of the dialysis liquid in the shunt line.
