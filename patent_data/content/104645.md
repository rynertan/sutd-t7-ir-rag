# Non catalytic ketoform syntheses.

## Abstract
A known base induced catalytic ketoform synthesis can now be carried out without sacrificing the directivity of the prior art process, but non catalytically, that is, in the absence of the phase transfer catalyst heretofore required, provided the ketone araldehyde is present in large excess from about 2 to about 25 times the calculated molar amount necessary to yield the reaction product. This synthesis obviates the problems of separating and recovering a phase transfer catalyst used in the prior art process.
