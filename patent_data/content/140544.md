# METHOD FOR PREPARATION OF GRAFT POLYMER MEMBRANES, AND ANION AND CATION EXCHANGE MEMBRANES

## Abstract
A method for the preparation of a graft polymer membrane comprising an inactive polymer film having TFS as a graft chain, wherein the inactive polymer film is irradiated with ionizing radiation, and the resulting irradiated film is graft polymerized by dipping in or otherwise contact ing the film with TFS or a solution thereof. This product may then be sulfonated to provide a cation exchange membrane or the obtained graft polymer may be haloalkylated, and quarternary aminated to provide an anion exchange membrane or the graft polymer membrane may be used to prepare a weakly acidic cation exchange mem brane by substituting at least part of the benzene rings of the graft polymer by one of the groups among hydroxyl groups, carboxylic acid groups, phosphoric acid groups and phos phorous acid groups.
