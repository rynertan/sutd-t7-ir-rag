## Abstract
Automatic telephone answering equipment is disclosed which is associated with a telephone set connected to a switching system along with other telephone sets, and the answering equipment function with central message record ing equipment which is also connected to the switching system. Unanswered incoming calls originating from within or without the switching system are answered by the automatic answering equipment which then transfers the call to either another of the telephone sets or to the message recording equipment, as selected by the user of the answer ing equipment. When the call is transferred to the central message recording equipment the identity of the telephone set to which the call was directed is forwarded to the recording equipment. Only upon the calling party recording a message in the central message recording equipment, the recording equipment uses the called telephone set identity to call the originally called telephone set. Upon the telephone answering equipment answering the call from the message recording equipment the recording equipment sends a signal which causes a message waiting visual indication to be provided at the answering equipment. Thereafter, in response to the visual message waiting signal the message recording equipment may be called by the user of the telephone set and the recorded message is played back.
