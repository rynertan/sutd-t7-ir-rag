# Quad edge video signal detector.

## Abstract
A method of processing a raster scan video signal representing an image and detecting the outline of one or more objects in the image represented by the video signal includes the steps of encoding the raster scan video signal as a sequence of binary pixel values, with each binary pixel value representing one pixel of the image, and then, for each of a plurality of the pixels, performing the following steps detecting when the binary pixel values representing the pixel and a horizontally adjacent pixel are distinct and detecting when both a the binary pixel values representing the pixel and a vertically adjacent pixel are distinct, and b the binary pixel values representing a pixel horizontally adjacent thereto are distinct. The position of the pixel is reported when either of the detecting steps detects distinct binary pixel values. The second detecting step eliminates redundant pixel reporting by eliminating the reporting of double diagonal pixels. Apparatus for carrying out the method includes means 21 for quantizing the video signal, means 22 for detecting vertical edges in the quantized image, means 23 for detecting horizontal edges in the quantized image, and means 24 for eliminating or preventing redundant reports of pixels along the outline of the objects in the image.
