DETAIED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIl lENT a Structure of the Word Processor The outer appearance of a word processor embodying the present invention is shown in Fig. 2. The word processor includes a keyboard 500 which is an external input device, a host computer 200 See Fig.3 which comprises electronic component parts such as CPU,ROM, RAM and others and an electric power source, a main body 300 equipped with floppy disk drive units 301 and 302 which are external storage devices, a display unit 100 and a printer 400 of a type utilizing a daisy wheel, which printer is an external output device. The main body 300 is equipped with a main switch not shown adapted to be manipulated by an operator, and the floppy disk drive units 301 and 302 which constitute the external storage devices. The display unit 100 is provided with a brightness adjusting knob not shown adapted to be manipulated by the operator when necessity arises, and a cathode ray tube 102 for displaying information inputed from the keyboard 500. Keys arranged on an operating board See Fig. 2 of the keyboard 500 constituting the external input device include character keys 510 for keying in alphanumeric characters one at a time as is the case with an ordinary typewriter, function keys 520 which are assigned with special commands when and so long as a program for the word processor is loaded, and ten keys 540 for keying in numerals one at a time. The printer 400 of a type utilizing the daisy wheel comprises a paper rest 402, a paper alignment guide 405 for aligning a paper at the time of insertion of a paper, a front cover 406, a silencer cover 407 for minimizing the emission of noises, a visor 404 for minimizing the reflection of external light, and a bail lever 450 serving concurrently as a switch for semi automatic paper insertion and as a paper retainer for retaining the paper during the printing. A procedure for making a document by the use of the work processor will now be described. Before the power supply is eftected, a system disk containing programs for the word processor and a data disk for the storage of contents of a document to be made are inserted respectively into the floppy disk drive units 301 and 302, and the main switch on the main body 300 is subse quently turned on. The host computer 200 accom .cdated in.the main body 300 goes to read out the contents of the system disk inserted into the floppy disk drive unit 301.When the contents of the programs for the word processor, which are stored in the system disk, are loaded the CRT screen 102 of the display unit 100 displays a framework 104 representative of the space in which the printer 400 can print out alphanumeric characters, and a cursor 31 at the leftmcst character position on the first line corresponding to the first character to be printed out. Starting from this condition, and when one of the character keys 510 on the keyboard 500 is depressed, a corresponding character is displayed at a location specified by and immediately above the cursor 31. b Structure of the Host Computer The schematic structure of the host computer 200 shown in Fig. 3 and the transaction of data in a ROM RAM memory 202 and signals from and to CPU 204 will now be described. CPU 204 is a so called microcomputer capable of performing an arithmetic operation and since registers, input and output ports and others as well as the function thereof are well known to those skilled in the art, the details thereof are not herein described for the sake of brevity. FDC 206 is a floppy disk controller for controlling the input to, and the output from, the floppy disk drive units 301 and 302. PRT I F 208 is an input output interface for the transaction of signals to and from PRT printer 400, and likewise, a CRT controller 210 is an input output interface for the transaction with CRT display unit 100 and connected with a video memory 214. A keyboard interface KB I F 212 is an input interface with the keyboard KB 500. CON I F 216 is an input output interface with the outside, and RTC 218 is a clock showing the current date and time.SPK I F 220 is an input output interface with a loudspeaker SPK 222. The loudspeaker 222 is used to issue a warning sound. At the outset, when the main switch on the main body 300 is turned on while the system disk and the data disk are inserted in the floppy disk drive units 301 and 302, respectively, CPU 204 causes the contents of the system disk to be stored at a RAM area of the RAM ROM memory 202 through the floppy disk controller 206 according to the contents of a program stored in a ROM area of the RAN1 ROM memory 202. Input signals from the keyboard 500 are inputed to CPU 204 through the keyboard interface 212. Subsequently, CPU 204 performs a process according to contents in a screen compiling routine storage unit, outputs signals toCRT display unit 100 through the CRT controller 210, and displays such signals on the CRT screen 102.Input signals fro the keyboard 500 are stored in the RAJA. of the RXM RGE memory 202 as a document memory. After the completion of the input, that is, the ccr position of a document, the output to the printer 400 takes place and this will now be described. In order for the composed document to be printed out by the printer 400, a Print key not shown on the keyboard 500 has to be depressed When a signal generated from the Print key is inputed to CPU 204 as an input signal from the keyboard 500,CPU 204 executes G print out signal generating routine stored in the RAM ROM memory 202 and outputs to the printer 400 the contents of a document then displayed on the CRT screen 102. c Keyboard Operating keys on the keyboard 500 will now be described to such an extent as to be required for the understanding of the description of the embodiment of the present invention. It is to be noted that Fig. 5 illustrates the details of the cursor moving keys 530 and the ten keys 540. Of the cursor moving keys 530 arranged sorewnat rightwards of the center of the keyboard 500, four pentagonal keys located centrally thereof are for moving the cursor 31 on the CRT screen 102, as shown in Fig. 4, in respective directions upward, downward, leftward and rightward represented by the acute angled corners. Two square keys disposed below the pentagonal keys are for moving the cursor 31 fast. Of the six keys disposed above the pentagonal keys, four keys, i.e., Change, Delete, Move and Copy keys 532, 533, 534 and 535 are used when the contents of a document composed on the CRT screen are to be copied, deleted, moved and dealt with in any other way, respectively. A location desired to be edited can be specified by moving the cursor 31 to such location.A Select key 537 is adapted to be depressed when a sub menu, or a content of the menu, is to be selected from the menu displayed on the CRT screen 102 by the selection of a key such as a Menu key 541 and others as will be described later. For example, by depressing the Select key, a document or a folder can be selected. A Cancel key 536 is a key used for cancelling the aforesaid operation. Of the ten keys 540 arranged at the top right position on the keyboard 500, Menu, Files, Search and Calc keys have the following respective functions. When the Menu key 541 is depressed, a menu is displayed on the CRT screen 102. When the Files key 542 is depressed, a list of all data files a files screen is formulated, e.g. see Figure 1, from both disks inserted in the drive units, that is a compilation of all the files and operative modes of working with the files is displayed. The user is not required to generate any commands to retrieve the documents for display but ra ther the present invention forces the user to interact with the system in response to being presented with the full content of both disks. This approach minimizes training since the system forces the user to respond and select an operation from the list of data displayed. Thus, a positive approach is utilized that leads the user by a full prompt display on the screen rather than requiring the user to enter preliminary commands. When the Search key 543 is depressed, the name of a document or a folder specified is retrieved. When the Calc key 544 is depressed, a desk top calculator is displayed without destroying the contents then displayed on the CRT screen 102 and can be used as a desk top calculator entirely independent of the word processor. At this time, the ten keys 540 are used as input keys. Functions of the function keys 520 arranged on the keyboard 500 leftwards of the character keys 510 can be changed arbitrarily by a program to be loaded. In the case of the program for the word processor now under discussion, when, for example, a function key of num 9 is depressed, the contents of a document composed on the CRT screen 102 are filed in the data diskette inserted in the floppy disk drive unit 302. d Document and Folder Display of document names on the CRT screen 102 will now be described by way of an example wherein a tree structure is composed of such document names as shown in Fig. 6. In this example, a diskette having a diskette name, PcW r Data Diskette, has seven documents storey therein which documents bear respective document names,Sample Document 1, Sample Document 2, File Specification,Manual, Sumwmary, Personal Document I, and Personal Document 2 . Means for dividing into a unit a group of documents corsing a plurality of documents to be bundled is herein referred to as a folder.In this example, the three documents, File Specification, Manual and Summary, belong to a folder named TECHNICAL REPORTS FOLDER, and the two documents Personal Document 1 and Personal Document 2 belong to a folder named PERSONAL FILES FOLDER. In the tree structure, the independent documents Sample Document 1 and SampleDocument 2, lay in the same level as the two folders,TECHNICAL REPORTS FOLDER and PERSONAL FLES FOLDER. A directory of diskettes stores data of the documents stored, so that they can be displayed in the form of a table. The data are stored in a unit shown by one horizontal line composed of columns for type, level, file name, title, number of contents, date of composition, date of renewal and others. Where the type column is C, D and F, it means that a single line recording is carried out for each of the diskette, the document and the folder. The level column represents the level in the tree structure. The file name column represents the name file name in the diskette for each document. The title column gives the name of the diskette, the name of the document and the name of the folder. The content number column is shown with the storage capacity of the diskette being used and in the case of the document and the folder, the number of pages and the number of document stored are respectively shown.The dateof composition column and the date of renewal column are shown with the date and the time, respectively, of composition of a directory file in the case of the diskette, and with the date and the current renewal date, respectively, of composition in the case of the document. Table 1 Date ofType Level File Name Title Content Nos.

At the first line on the screen the line number being shown at the rightmost part of Fig. 1 for better understanding , the name of the column Files, Pages, Created and Edited is displayed above the underline 1. In the column of Files, the contents of the type column, the level column and the title column of the directory are displayed. In each of the Pages column, the Created column and the Edited column, the contents of the content number column, the date of composition column and the date of renewal column are displayed. At the second line both a 5 symbol 2 and a name Blank Paper 3 are displayed. The 5 symbol 2 indicates that the name following the symbol is the name of a document.As will be described later, this document is used when a document having no content is to be composed. At the third line, both a m symbol 4 and a name Empty Folder 5 are displayed. The 2 symbol 4 indicates that the name following the symbol is the name of the folder.As will be described later, this folder is used when a folder having no content is to be composed. At the fifth line separated rom a line 10a at the fourth line, the name 11 of the system disk of the word processor system inserted in the left hand disk drive unit 301, the date of ccccosition, the hour of carosition, and the percentage of the disk used are displayed. A E symbol 12 indicates that the name following this symbol is the name of the diskette. The. display is separated by the line 10b the seventh line below a blank line. Lines 10a and lOb at the fourth and seventh lines are connected together by a vertical line 10c at the let side. After another line 20a at the seventh line, each of the lines following the eighth line inclusive is used to display the contents corresponding to a respective line of the contents of the directory shown in Table 1. At the eighth line, and following the E symbol 12 at the righthand position indicating the diskette type C inserted in the right hand disk drive unit 302, the diskette name, the date of composition, the hour of composition and the per centage of the disk used are successively displayed. At the tenth and eleventh lines following a blank line, the document names 21, the number of pages, the dates of compo simon and the dates of renewal of the respective documents,Sample Document 1 and Sample Document 2 are displayed.A line 22 extending in the leftmost and central portions of the twelfth line and in the rightmost portion of the thirteenth line and further extending downwards from the leftmost portion of the twelfth line so as to depict a contour similar to the shape of an upper edge of an actually existing paper folder indicates that the information displayed below such line 22 is the contents or the folder.The thirteenth line displays both the folder name 23 TECH NICAL REPORTS FOLDER and the number of documents contained in this folder. From the fourteenth line to the sixteenth line, the document frames 21 shown as rightwardly indented sequentially since the level is displaced one line below , the numbers of pages, the dates of composition, and the dates of renewal ot the respective documents belonging to this folder are displayed. Similarly, the presence between the seventh and eighteenth lines of a line 22 shaped so as to represent the contour of the upper ego of another actually existing paper folder indicates that the information therebelow represents the contents of the folder the vertical components of the two lines 22 being connected together at the right hand side . At the eighteenth line, both the folder name PERSONAL FILES FOLDER and the number of documents contained in this folder are displayed. At the nineteenth and twentieth line, the dates of composition and the dates of renewal of the respective documents belonging to this folder are displayed. At the twenty first line, a line 20b is displayed.This line 20b is connected at a left hand portion with the second line at the seventh line through a vertical line 20c to indicate that the display associated with all of the documents has been made. A cursor position indicator 30 represented by a marking shown at the leftmost margin indicates the line at which the cursor 31 is located. The last line a prompt line 40 of the screen provides a display of advice made to the operator. Since, as hereinabove described, the files screen is associated with the type of the directory, the level, the title, the number of contents, the date of ccrposi,ion and the date or renewal, the contents of the director files can be renewed by editing on the screen in a manner which will now be described. It is, however, to be noted that, where all cannot be displayed on the same screen because of too many documents, they can be displayed when they are scrolled up and down by operating the cursor keys 531. f Document Editing Flow for Document Control The document editing the opening and closing of the folder, the preparation of an empty folder, the copying of a document, the copying of a folder, the movement of a document, the movement of a folder, the deletion of the folder, the arrangement of documents within a folder, the retrieval of the document or the folder, and others to be done by the use of a list of documents Fig. 1 in the diskette displayed on the screen will now be described. At this mode, a flowchart shown in Fig. 7 of a program about the files edition stored in the RAM ROM memory 202 will be described. When a key input is fed at step 702, a.decision is made at step 704 to determine whether or not the Files key 542 has been depressed. If the Files key 542 has not been depressed, a subroutine for the document input and edition is initialed at step 706 and, thereafter, step i702 is resumed. On the other hand, if the Files key 542 has been depressed, the list or the documents Files screen is displayed at step 708 See section g . Then, a search buffer index i is rendered to be 1 and, after a search buffer has been initialized at step 0710, a key input is awaited at step 720. It is to be noted that the search buffer S and the search buffer index i are used in Fig. 42. When the key input has been made at step 710, a decision is made to determine the nature of the key input.At the outset, it is determined at step g722 whether or not a Down Cursor key 531a has been depressed. If the key 531a has been depressed, a subroutine for Cursor Down see section h is executed at step num 724 and then a key input is again awaited at step 2720. If, however, the key 531a has not been depressed, another decision is mase at step 726 to determine if an Up Cursor key 531b has been depressed.If it has been depressed, a subroutine for CursorUp see section g is executed at step num 728 and then a key input is again awaited at step 720. On the other hand, if the Up Cursor key 513b has not been depressed, a decision is made at step 730 to determined if the Copy key 535 has been depressed.Should the key 535 be found to have been depressed, a subroutine for Copy see section k is executed at step 732, a result of which is written in the directory file of the disk at step 760 and is then displayed on the screen at step 9708. It is, however, to be noted that, in the event of the occurrence of an input from a Cancel key during the execution of the copying subroutine, the key input is again awaited at step t720. If the Copy key 535 has not been depressed, a decision is made at step 734 to determine if the Move key 534 has been depressed.If it has been found to be the Move key 534, a subroutine for Move is executed at step F736 t the result of which is written in the directory file of the disk at step T760 and is then displayed on the screen at step 708. It is, however, to be noted that, when the Cancel key is depressed during the execution of the Move subroutine, a key input is again awaited at step i720. If it has not been depressed, a decision is made at step 8738 to determine if the Delete key 533 has been depressed.If the result of the decision is YES111 a subroutine for Delete see section m is executed at step µ740, the result of which is written in the directory file of the disk at step g760 and is then displayed on the screen at step µ708. It is, however, to be noted that, when the Cancel key is depressed during the execution of theDelete subroutine, a key input is again awaited at step num 720. If the result of the decision indicates NO , a further decision is made at step t742 to determine if theChange key 532 has been depressed.If the result of the decision indicates bYES , a subroutine for Sort see section n is executed at step g744, written in the directory file of the disk at step g760, and finally displayed on the screen at step num 708. However, if the Cancel key is depressed during the execution of the Sort subroutine, a key input is again awaited at step 720. On the other hand, if the result of the decision indicates NO , a decision is made at step g746 to determine if the Select key 537 has been depressed.If it has been depressed, a subroutine forSelect see section t is executed at step num 748 and the program flow returns to the key input at step g702. If, however, the Cancel key is depressed during the execution of the Select subroutine, a key input is again awaited at step i720. If the result of the decision indicates NO , a decision is made at step num 750 to determine whether or not the Search key 543 has been depressed. If it is, a subroutine for Search see section o is executed at step 752 and a key input is then awaited at step i720. If it is not, it means that a wrong key has been erroneously depressed, and accordingly, a warning sound beep is generated at step i754 and a key input is again awaited at step 2720. g Display of List of Document Names The display of a list of document names which takes place at step 708 shown in Fig. 7 when the Files key 542 has been depressed is carried out according ta 2 flow chart shown in Fig. 8, composed of Figs. 8tea and 8 b . The display on the screen of the directory of the table is shown in Fig. 9 wherein line numbers are shown at the rightmost margin for the purpose of quick reference . At step P802, 2 decision is made to determine whether or not a new document is being composed. If it is, the title is prepared at step P804 frora this document which will not be herein described and, after the storage at stepP806 of the composition of the document of the new title, the program proceeds to step P820. If it is not, a decision is made at step P810 to determine whether or not an old document is being composed. If it is being composed, the old document is stored at step P812. Subsequently, the directory file is read in the memory at step P820. After the display of the column names and others the first line to the seventh line in Fig. 9 , a display record pointer is placed at a position of the initial record of the directory at step P822. Different decisions are successively performed at steps P830 P840 and P860 to determine whether or not the type of the record indicated by the pointer is C, whether or not it is F, and whether or not it is D and the level is 1, respectively. In the event that the type is C, a disk marking corresponding to one of the left hand and right hand disk positions, the title name of entry , the date of composition, and the storage capacity of the disk are successively displayed at respective steps P832, P834, P836 and P838 see the eighth line in Fig. 9 . In the event that the type is F, both the outer framework 11 or the folder and a folder marking 2 are displayed at step P842, and the name of the folder and the number of documents included in the folder are successively displayed at respective steps P844 and P846 see t . twelfth line to the thirteenth line in Fig. 9 , followed by stepP870. In the even that the type is D and the level is 1, the document marking, the document name, the number of pages, the date of composition and the date of renewal are successively displayed at respective steps P862, P864, P866,P868 and P869 see the tenth line in Fig. 9 . Then the display record pointer is advanced one place at step P870, followed by a decision at step P872 to determine whether or not the record has been completed. Should the record have been completed, the hour is displayed on the prompt line at step P880, followed by the return. On the other hand, in the event that the record has not been completed, step P830 is again resumed to continue the display. From tne directory file shown in the foregoing table, the display of the diskette and the display of both the folder and the document wherein the level is 1 are carried out as shown inFig. 9. In this case, the folder is closed.In other worms, no document name within the folder is displayed reel to section j as to the display of the documents within the folder . h Movement of the Cursor Position Indicator The subroutine for moving the cursor position indicator 30 downwards step i724 in Fig. 7 is executed according to a flowchart shown in Fig. 10. When the Cursor Down key 531a is depressed, and wnen it is indicated at step P1010 that the cursor position indicator 30 is located at a Blank Paper position, it is moved to an Empty Folder position. If it is determined at step P1020 that it is located at the Empty Folder position, it is moved to a System Disk Entry position at step P1025.If it is determined at step P1030 that it is located at aSystem Disk Entry Position, it is moved to a Data Disk Entry position and the record pointer is replaced at the initial position at step P1035. If it is determined at step P1040 that it is located at a position of the closed folder, the contents of the record point are incremented by 1 at step P1045. If it is determined that it is located at the final record position, it is not moved. If it is not located at any one of the foregoing positions, the display record pointer is advanced one place at step P1060. A Cursor Up subroutine to be performed when theCursor Up key 531b for moving the cursor 31 upwards is depressed is executed according to a flowchart of Fig. 11. When at step P1110 it is determined that the cursor position indicator 30 is located at the Blank Paper position, no movement is allowed. However, when at stepP1120 it is determined that the indicator 30 is located at the Empty Folder position, it is moved to the Blank Paper position at step P1125. When at step P1130 it is determined that the indicator 30 is located at the System Disk Entry position, it is moved to the Empty Folder position at stepP1135. When at step P1140 it is determined that it is located at the Data Disk Entry position, it is moved to theSystem Disk Entry position at step P1145. When at stepP1150 it is determined that the indicator 30 is located one place below the closed folder, the record pointer is decremented by the number of contents of the closed folder plus one.If it is determined that the indicator 30 is not located at any one of the foregoing positions, the record pointer is decremented by one at step P1160. i Display of Documents When the Select key 537 is depressed step num 746 inFig. 7 , the display of the tiles screen and the opening and closing of the folder are enabled as shown by a flowchart ofFig. 12. When the cursor position indicator 30 is located at the Blank Paper position see step P1210 at the time theSelect key 537 has been depressed, and when the Enter key 545 is subsequently depressed see step P1212 , a blank document blank page is displayed at step P1214 on the screen and the next key input is awaited step g702 inFig. 7 . When the position indicator 30 is located at a document position, and the Enter key 545 is subsequently depressed at step P1222, 2 document scifed by the cursor 31 is read out from the disk and then displayed on the screen at step P1224, and the next key input is awaited step 702 in Fig. 7 . When the indicator 30 is located at a closed folder position at step P1230, as will be described later, the folder is opened at step P1232, the documents in the folder are displayed at step P1234, and the next key input is awaited step g720 in Fig. 7 . When the indicator 30 is located at an opened folder position at step P1240, the folder is closed at stepP1242, the documents explained under section g are displayed at step P1244, and the next key input is awaited step t720 in Fig. 7 . If the indicator 30 is not located at any one of the foregoing positions, and when the Select key 537 is depressed, a warning sound is generated at step P1250 and the next key input is awaited step g720 in Fig. 7 . Processes which take place at respective stepsP1212 and P1222 when the Enter key 545 is depressed are performed according to a flowchart shown in Fig. 13. A key input subsequent to the depression of the Select key 537 takes place at step P1310. If the key which has been depressed is found to be the Cancel key 536 at step P1320, the title of the record pointed by the document record pointer is returned to a normal display at step P1322. If the Enter key 545 has been depressed, the next succeeding step takes place. If it is not any one of the above mentioned keys, a warning sound is generated at step P1340 and a key input is awaited at step P1310. j Opening and Closing of Folder The opening and closing of the folder steps P1230 to P1244 in Fig. 12 referred to under the Select process section h will be described in detail. The folder once closed can be opened in the following manner. Referring to the main flow shown in Fig. 7, it it is determined at step 704 that the key input at step num 702 is the Files key 542, both the closed file and an independent document level I can be displayed on the screen at step 708, The opening of the closed folder can be accomplished by manipulating the Cursor Down key 531a and theCursor Up key 531b at respective steps 4722 and 726, moving the cursor position indicator 30 to a position of the folder to be opened, and finally depressing the Select key 537 at step 746. By way or example, when the closed folders TECEN1CAL REPORTS FOLDER and PERSONAL FILES FOLDER as shown in Fig. 9 are opened, the result will be such as shown inFig. 1 and the document name within the folder is displayed. A process for displaying the document within the folder which takes place at step P1234 is carried out according to a flowchart shown in Fig. 14. At the outset, it is determined at step P1414 whether or not the type of record corresponding to the position of the cursor at the time the Select key 537 has been depressed is F Folder . If it is not a folder, a warning sound is generated at stepP1412 and the process terminates. If it is a folder, the value of the record pointer is rendered at step P1414 to be a value of a display record pointer. Subsequently, a decision is made at step P1420 whether or not the record type is D and the level is 2, that is, whether or not it is a document within the folder. If it is a document within the folder, the left hand framework of the folder is displayed, a character is shifted down and the document marking is displayed at step P1422. Then, the document name, the number of pages, the date of composition and the date of renewal are sequentially displayea at respective steps P1424, P1426, P1427, and P1428. The displayed record pointer is then advanced one place at step Pi429, with the process returning to step P1420 in readiness for the nect record processing. Up until all of the documents within the folder are displayed, a process from step P1420 to step P1429 is repeated.If the decision at step Ply20 indicates that it is not a document within the folder, the process returns to step P830 and the following records are displayed. The folder once opened can be closed in the following manner. The cursor moving keys 531 are manipulated at steps num 722 and 726 to move the cursor 31 to a position of the folder to be closed, and when the Select key 537 is subsequently depressed at step g746, and after the value of the display record pointer has been rendered equal to the value of the record pointer P1242 , a flow for the screen display is performed from B of Fig. 8 and only the folder and the independent document are displayed on the screen. k Preparation of Blank Document and Blank Folder Copying of Document and Folder During the copying process step 732 in the main flow of Fig. 7, the preparation of a blank document and a blank tolder, and the copying of the document and the opened and closed folders take place, according to a zlowchert shown in Fig. 15. By depressing the Files keys 542 at step 704, displaying the files screen Fig. 9, Fig. 1 and other at step 708, manipulating the cursor moving keys 531 at steps 722 and T26 to move the cursor 31 to a position of the record to be dandled and depressing the Copy key 535 at step 73Gt the copying process is performed. At the outset, the record title pointed by the record pointer is displayed at step P1502 in the form as reversed, and the value of the reversed record pointer is then rendered equal to the value of the record point at step P15c 4. Also, an indication reading Copy where Point where file is to go and press NTER. Press CANCEL to quirt. is displayed at the prompt line in the form as reversed. Then, when the position of the cursor 31 at the time of depression of the Copy key 535 is determined to beBlank Paper at step P1510, and when the cursor is moved to the next position and the Enter key 545 is subsequently depressed at step P1512, a blank document can be prepared at that position at step P1514 see section ck 2 . If the position of the cursor 31 at the time of the depression of the Copy key 535 is determined at step P1520 to be Empty Folder, and when the cursor 31 is moved and the Enter key 545 is subsequently depressed at step P1522, a blank folder is prepared at that position at stepP1524 see section k 4 . If the position of the cursor 31 at the time of the depression or the Copy key 535 is determined at stepP1530 to be a closed folder, and when the Enter key 545 is depressed at step P1532 after the cursor 31 has been moved. to a different position, the closed folder is copied at that position at step P1534 see section k 4 . If the position of the cursor 31 at the ti .e of the depression of the Copy key 535 is determined at stepP1540 to be an opened folder, and when the Enter key 545 is depressed at step P1542 after the cursor 31 has been moved to a different position, the opened folder is copied at that position at step P1544 see section k 4 . If the position of the cursor 31 at the time of the depression of the Copy key 535 is determined at stepP1550 to be a document, the document is copied at step P1552 at the position at which the Enter key 545 is depressed at step P1552 after the cursor 31 has been moved to a different position see section k 32 . When the Copy key 535 is depressed while the cursor 31 is located at a position other than the above mentioned positions, a warning sound is generated at stepP1560 and the program flow for Copy terminates while the next succeeding key input is awaited. A Move. Enter process step P1512 and others wherein after the cursor 31 used during the copying manisu laticn has been moved, the Enter key is depressed, is carried out according to a flowchart shown in Fig. 16. ht a key input occurs at step P1602 subsequent to the depres sic of the Copy key 535, 2 decision is made at step P1610 to cete ... ne whether or not the key then depressed is the Cursor Down key 531a.If it is determined that the key 531a has been depressed, the Cursor Down subroutine described with reverence to Fig. 10 is executed at step P1612 and the next succeeding key input is awaited at step P1602. there after, another decision is made at step P1620 to determined whether or not it is the Curscr Up key 531b. If it is, theCursor Up subroutine described with reference to Fig. 11 is executed at step P1622 and the next succeeding key input is awaited at step P1602. In this way, the cursor 31 is moved to the position at which a copy is to be made, by the use of the cursor movig keys 531. Thereafter, a decision is made at step P1630 to determine if it is the Cancel key 536. If it is, the title of the record pointed by the reversed pointer is returned at step P1632 to an ordinary display, and this flow is ter minted in readiness for the next succeeding key input. Another decision is also made at step P1640 to determine if it is the Enter key 545. If it is, a subroutine for the next succeeding copying is resumed to effect the copying see Fig. 15 . If it Is not any one of the above mentioned keys, a warning sound is generated at step P1650 and the key input is again awaited at step P1612. k 1 Preparation of Empty Folder The blank folder can be prepared by the following procedure. In the files screen such as shown, for example, in Fig. 9 , the cursor 31 is moved up and down by the manipulation of the cursor moving keys 531 to move it to a position of Empty Folder, and the Copy key 535 is then depressed. In this way, as shown in Fig. 17 b , Empty Folder11 is displayed at step P1502 on the screen in the form as reversed It is to be noted that, for the sake of brevity, any display which occurs on the screen ir. the form as reversed is shown by a rectangular box enclosing a legend in the drawings except for Fig. 17 b . and a direction not shown is also displayed at the prompt line in the form as reversed.Subsequently, as shown in Fig. 17 c , the cursor 31 is moved to a position where the empty folder is desired to be prepared. When the Enter key 545 is then depressed at step P1522, the empty folder is prepared one line below such position at step P1524 as shown in Fig. 17 d . Thereafter, as shown in Fig. 17 e , the folder name is keyed in from the keyboard 500. Where a document exists below the position at which the empty folder is to be prepared for example, as shown in Fig. 18 a , this document is included within a new folder Fig 18 b . The preparation of the empty folder step P1524 is carried out according to a flowchart shown in Fig. 19.At the beginning, a buffer for the number of contents is zeroed at step P1902, and the record pointer is advanced one place at step P1904. Then, a decision is made at step P1910 to determine if the record pointed by the record pointer exists. If it exists, all of the records from such record to the last record are downwardly shifted a distance corresponding to each record at step Pl912. If it does not exist, the next succeeding step is assumed. Thereafter, the record pointed out by the record pointer is erased, the type is rendered to be F, and the level is set to 1 at step P1914. A decision is then made at step P1920 to determine whether or not any document exists below and between the next folders. If it exists, the number or the documents below is inputed to the buffer for the number of contents at step P1911. Subsequently, a decision is made at step P1930 to determined whether or not any folder exists above. If it exists, the number of contents of the proceding folder is subtracted by the value of the buffer for the number of contents at step P1932. Then, the number of contents of a new folder is rendered to be the value of the buffer for the number of contents at step p1940. In this way, the empty folder is displayed on the screen. It is, however, to be noted that, if it is found at step P1920 that no document exists below, step P1940 is resumed. Figs. 17 a to 17 e illustrate an example wherein the empty file is prepared on the screen at a location preceding TECHNICAL REPORTS FOLDER. In this example, since no document exists therebelow and preceding the next suc ceeding folder, the number of documents accommoaated in this folder is zero. Figs. 18 a and 18 b illustrate an example wherein the empty folder is prepared at the location ofSAMPLE DOCUMENT 1. In this example, two documents, SAMPLEDOCUMENT 1 and SAMPLE DOCU NT 2, are included in this empty folder. When the folder name for example, SAMPLE FOLDER composed of characters within the framework of 33 characters is keyed in at step P1950 by manipulating character keys 510, the folder name so inputed is inputed into the title of the folder and displayed on the screen at step P1952. After the above described manipulation, a new content is written in the directory file of the disk at step 2760. i 2 Preparation of Empty Document The empty document can be prepared in the following manner. In the files screen for example, as shown inFig. 53, the cursor 31 is moved up and down by manipulatlng the cursor moving keys 531 to move it to a position of BlankPaper, and the Copy key 535 is then depressed. In this way, as shown in Fig. 20 a , Blank Paper is displayed see stepP1502 in Fig. 15 in the form as reversed and a direction not shown is also displayed at the prompt line in the form as reversed. Thereafter, the cursor 31 is moved to a position where the empty document is desired to be prepared. The subsequent depression of the Enter key 545 at step P1512 results in the preparation, at step P1514, of the empty document at a location one line therebelow as shown in Fig. 20 b . The preparation of the empty document at stepP1514 is carried out according to a flowchart shown in Fig.21. At the beginning, the record pointer is advanced one place at step P2102, and a decision is then made at stepP2104 to determine whether or not there exists the record pointed by the record pointer. If it exists, all of the records from such record to the last record are downwardly shifted a distance corresponding to each record at stepP2106. If it does not exist, the next succeeding step is resumed. Thereafter, the record pointed by the record pointer is erased and the type is rendered to be D at step P2110. Then, the read out of the date from RTC 218 at stepP2112, the preparation of a new file name corresponding to the date, the naming of the file at step P2114, the.preparation of a file of the new file name at step P2116, and the dating as at step P2118 of the date of preparation of both the date of composition and the date of renewal are successively and sequentially performed. Thereafter, a decision is made at step P2120 to determine whether or not there exists a folder thereabove.If it exists, the level is rendered to be 2 at step P2112, the punker of contents of the folder thereabove is incremented by 1 at step P2124, and the empty document so prepared is included within this folder. If it does not exist, the level is rendered to be 1 at step P2126, thereby render ing it to be an independent document. Thereafter, by manipulating character keys 510, the document name is keyed in at step P2130, and the document name so inputed is displayed at step P2132 on the screen as a title. Figs. 20 a and 20 b illustrate an example wherein, in the files screen shown in Fig. 1, the empty document is prepared at a position of Sample Document 1 by depressing the Enter key 545. k 3 Copying of Document The document can be copied in the following procedure. In the files screen, the cursor 31 is moved up and down by the manipulation of the cursor moving keys 531 to move it to a position of 2 document desired to be copied as shown in Fig. 22 a , and the Copy key 535 is then depressed. Then, as shown in Fig. 22 b , this document is displayed at step P1502 in Fig. 15 in the form as reversed.and a direction not shown is also displayed at the prompt line in the form as reversed. When the Enter key 545 is depressed step P1552 in Fig. 15 after the cursor 31 has been moved to a position desired to be copied it is to be noted that Fig. 22 b , the cursor 31 is not moved , the document desired to be copied is brought to a positior. one line therebelow as shown in Fig. 22 c . At this time, the copied document, although having the initially given document name and the initial document number of pages, is date as of the date of composition and the date of renewal which are the date on which it has been copied. The copying of the document step P1554 in Fig, 15 is carried out according to a flowchart shown in Fig.23. At the beginning, the record pointer is advanced one place at step P2302, and a decision is made at step P2304 to determine whether or not there exists a record pointed by the record pointer. If it exists, all of the records from such record to the last record are shifted downwards a distance corresponding to each record, but if it does not exist, the next succeeding step is resumed. Then, the document pointed by the reversed record pointer step P1504 is copied at a position of the record pointer at step P2310. Then, the hour is read from RTC 218 at step P2320 a new file name corresponding to the hour is prepared and is given a file name at step P2322 the old file is copied in the new file at step P2324 and the date of composition and the date of renewal are rendered to be the date of preparation at step P2326. After that, a decision is made at step P2330 to determine if there is a folder thereabove. If there is, the level is rendered to be 2 at step P2332, the number of contents of the folder thereabove is incremented by 1 at step P2334, and the copied document is included within this folder. If it is not, the level is rendered to be 1 at stepP2336 thereby rendering it to be an independent document. k 4 Copying of Folder When the folder is to be copied, the operation differs depending on whether such folder is closed or whether is it opened. In the case of the opened folder, only the folder is copied, but not any document within the folder. On the other hand, in the case of the closed folder, not only the folder, but also the documents within such folder are copied. The folder can be copied in the following procedure. An example of a copy of the closed folder and that of the opened folder are respectively shown in Figs. 24 a to 24 d and Figs. 25 a to 25 d . In the files screen, the cursor 31 is moved up and down by the manipulation of the cursor moving keys 531 to move it to a position of the folder to be copied Fig. 24 a . Should only the folder be desired to be copied, the folder is opened Fig. 25 a . On the other hand, if the document within the folder is desired to be copied as well, the folder is left closed.And, theCopy key 535 is depressed wherefore, in the screen, the name of the folder to be copied is displayed in the form as reversed and a direction is also displayed at the prompt line in the form as reversed Fig. 24 b and Fig. 25 b .When the Enter key 545 is depressed after the cursor 31 has been moved to a position of the folder desired to be copied Fig. 24fc and Fig. 25 c steps P1532 and P1542 in Fig.15 , the folder is prepared one line below such position step P1534 and P1544 in Fig. 15 Fig. 24 d and Fig. 25 d The copying of the closed folder step P1534 is carried out according to a flowchart shown in Fig. 26. At the beginning, the buffer for the number of contents is zeroed at step P2602. A decision is then made at step P2604 to determine if the position of the cursor is the closed folder. If it is, the record pointer is advanced the number of contents of the folder plus 1 at step P2606. If it is not, the recorder pointer is advanced one place at step P2608 and the following process is carried out.At the outset, a decision is made at step P2610 to determine if such record is a folder and, if it is not, that is, if it is a document the number of documents from the record pointer to the next succeeding folder is rendered to be a buffer for the number of contents at step P2612 in order to insert in the copied folder. Moreover, another decision is made at step P2614 to determine whether or not there is a folder thereabove, and if it exists, it means that such document has been included in that folder and, therefore, the number of contents of such folder is subtracted by the value of the buffer for the number of contents at step P2616. Then, the program flow proceeds to the next step. A decision is then made at step P2620 to determine whether or not there is a record pointed by the record pointer, and if it exists, all of the records from such record to the last record are downwardly moved the number of contents of the folder pointed by the record pointer the number of documents plus 1 at step P2622. Thereafter, a decision is made at step P2624 to determine if the value of the reversed record pointer is greater than the value of the record pointer. If it is greater than the value of the record pointer, the reversed record pointer is advanced at step P2626 a number equal to the number over which it has been moved. Then, the record pointed by the reversed record pointer is copied at step P2628 at the position of the record pointer a number of times equal to the number of contents of the folder plus 1. Then, the record pointer is advanced one place at step P2630. Subsequently, the hour is read from RTC 218 at step P2632 a new file name corresponding to the hour is prepared and rendered to be as a file name at step P2634 the old file is copied in the new file at step Pew636 and the date of composition and the date of renewal are dated at step P2638. Thereafter, a decision is made at step P2640 to determine if the process from step P2630 to step P2638 has been repeated a number of times equal to the number of contents of the folder. If it is not, this process is repeated. However, if it has been done, the number of contents of the folder is added at step P2642 with the value of the buffer for the number of contents and, thereafter, the program flow returns. The copying of the opened folder step P1544 is carried out according to a flowchart shown in Fig. 27. At the beginning, the buffer for the number of contents hereinafter referred to as content buffer is zeroed at stepP2702 and a decision is subsequently made at step P2704 to determine whether or not the position of the cursor is the closed folder. It it is, the record pointer is advanced the number of contents of the folder plus 1 at step P2706. However, if it is not, the record pointer is advanced one place at step P2708 and the following process takes place.In the first place, a decision is made at step P2710 to determine whether or not such record is a folder. If it is not, it means that the record is a document and, therefore, in order to insert it in the copied folder, the number of documents from the record pointer to the next succeeding folder is rendered to be the content buffer at step P2712.Another decision is made at step P2714 to determine whether or not there is a folder thereabove, ana if it exists, it means that such document has been included in that folder and, therefore, the number of contents of such folder is subtracted by the value of the content buffer at step P2716. Subsequent to step P2716, a decision is made at step P2720 to determine whether or not there is a record pointed by the record pointer. If there is, all of the record from such record to the final record are downwardly shifted a distance equal to each record at step P2722. Then, another decision is made at step P2724 to determine whether or not the value of the reversed record pointer is greater than the record pointer, and if it is, the reversed record pointer is advanced one place at stepP2726. Thereafter, the folder pointed by the reversed record pointer is copied at the position of the record pointer at step P2728. t Movement The movement step 736 of the folder and document to another position in the files screen can be performed by the following procedure. When the Move key 534 is depressed after the Files key 542 has been depressed to effect the files screen step 7Q8 in Fig. 7 , and the cursor has subsequently been moved by the manipulation of the cursor moving keys 531 to a position of the document or folder desired to be moved steps g724 and 728 , a Move subroutine is initiated at step 736 In the screen, the title is displayed in the form as reversed and a direction reading Move where Point of where file is to go and pressENTER.Press CANCEL to quit. a is also displayed at the prompt line in the form as reversed. . Subsequently, the cursor 31 is moved to a position to which the document or folder is to be moved, and the Enter key 545 is then depressed. In this way, the document or folder is displayed one line below such position and delated from the original position. The movement at step f736 is s carried out according to a flowchart shown in Fig. 28. When the Move key 534 is depressed after the cursor 31 has been moved to a position of the document or document to be moved, the title of the record pointed by the record pointer is displayed in the form as reversed at step P2802, and the value of the reversed record pointer is rendered to be the value of the record pointer at step P2804. Then, a decision is made at step P2810 to determine whether or not such record is a closed folder. If it is, and when a Move Enter process is effected at step P2812 wherein after the cursor has been moved to the position to which the folder or document is to be moved the Enter key 545 is depressed, a Move process for the closed folder takes place at step P2814, followed by the process step µ76C shown in Fig. 7. Then, another decision is made at step P2820 to determine whether or not such record is an opened folder.If it is, and when the above mentioned Move Enter process is performed at step P2832, a process of the document Move is performed at step P2834 followed by the process step g760 inFig. 7. In event that such record is neither the folder nor the document, a warning sound is generated at step P2840 and the next succeeding key input is awaited step i720 inFig. 7 . L 2 Movement of Document In connection with the movement of the document, where it is moved within the folder, such document is included in the folder with the number of documents in such folder consequently increased by one. At this time, when the movement is executed even though such folder is closed, the folder is opened and the document moved is displayed at the top of such folder. Figs. 29 a to 29 d illustrate diagrams of screen displays showing the sequence of process for the movement of the document to the closed folder. In the files screen, the cursor 31 is moved to a position of a document SampleDocument desired to be moved Fig. 29 a . When the Move key 534 is depressed, the document name is displayed in the form as reversed and, although not shown, a direction is also displayed at the prompt line in the form as reversed Fig. 29 b3 . Thereafter, the cursor 31 is moved to the position of the folder desired to be moved Fig. 29 c . The subsequent depression of the Enter key 545 at step P2832 results in the opening of the folder and the document moved is displayed at the top of the opened folder In this example, since no documents have existed in the original folder, only the document moved is displayed Fig. 29 d . A process for the document movement at step P2834 is carried out according to a flowchart shown in Fig. 30.At the outset, a decision is made at step P3002 to determine whether or not there is a folder preceding a position of the reversed record pointer. If there is, that is, if the folder contains a document to be moved, the number of contents of the folder is decreased by one at step P3004 and the folder is displayed at step P3006. If there is not, the next succeeding process step is resumed. Then, the record at the position of the reversed record printer is retreated in a record buffer at stepP3010. Then, another decision is made at step P3012 to determine whether or not the value of the record pointer is greater than the value of the reversed record pointer. If it is greater, that is, when the document is to be moved below, all of the records from the reversed record pointer plus I to the record are moved upwards a distance equal to each record at step P3014. On the other hand, if it is smaller, that is, when the document is to be moved upwards, all of the records from the record to the reversed record pointer plus 1 are moved downwards a distance equal to each record at step P3016. Thereafter, the contents of the record buffer is restored at step P3018 to the record at the position of the record pointer. At step P3020, a decision is made to determine whether or not there is a folder above the position of the record pointer. If there is, that is, when the folder contains the document moved, the folder is opened at stepP3022, the number of contents of the folder is increased by one at step P3024, and the level of the document moved is rendered to be 2 at step P3026. If there is no folder preceding the record pointer, the level of the document moved is rendered to be 1 at step P3028. t 2 Movement of Folder When a folder is to be moved, the operation therefor differs depending on whether the folder is opened or whether it is closed. In the case of the closed folder, both the folder and the document in such folder are moved, but in the case of the opened folder, only the folder is moved. An example applicable where the folder is closed is shown in Figs. 31 a to 31 d whereas an example where the folder is opened is shown in Figs. 32 a to 32 d . A procedure for the movement of the folder is performed in the following manner. In the files screen step num 708 , the cursor 31 is moved up and down by the manipulation of the cursor moving keys 531 steps 724 and num 728 to a position of the folder to be moved Figs. 31 a and 32 a . Where only the folder is desired to be moved, the folder is opened Fig. 32 z , but where both the folder and the documents are desired to be moved, the folder is closed Fig. 31 a . When the Move key 534 is subsequently depressed, in the files screen, the folder name is displayed in the form as reversed and a direction is also displayed at the prompt line in the form as reversed Figs. 31 b and 32 b . Then, the cursor 31 is moved to the position to which it is to be moved Figs.31 c and 32 c , and the Enter key 545 is subsequently depressed. In this way, on the files screen, the folder located at the original position has been deleted and is displayed at a new position Figs. 31 d and 32 d . During the movement when the folder is opened, only the folder is moved, and the document within such folder remains in the form as presented and is, if there is another folder thereabove, included in such folder. On the other hand, if there is no folder thereabove, it becomes a document of the folder. The movement of the closed folder at step P2814 is carried out according to a flowchart shown in Fig. 33. At the outset, the content buffer is zeroed at step P3302, followed by a decision step P3304 to determine whether or not the position of the cursor is a closed folder. If it is, the record pointer is advanced the number of contents of the folder plus 1 at step P3306, but if it is not, the record pointer is advanced one place at step P3308 and the following process takes place. In the first place, a decision is made at step P3310 to determine whether or not the record is a folder. If it is not, that is, if it is a document, the number of documents from the record pointer to the next succeeding folder is rendered to be the content buffer at step P3312 in order to insert it in the folder to be moved.Another decision is made at step P3314 to determine whether or not there is a folder thereabove, and if there is, it means that the document is the one which has been included in such folder, and therefore, the number of contents of such folder is subtracted by the value of the content buffer at step P3316. Thereafter, the next succeeding step is assumed. At step P3318, a decision is made to determine whether or not the record pointer is greater than the reversed record pointer. If it is greater, the record pointer is returned one place at step P3320, but if it is. not greater, the next succeeding step is assumed. Thereafter, the following program flow is repeated a number of times equal to the number of contents or the folder the number of documents plus 1. That is, in the first place a decision is made at step P3330 to determine whether or not the record pointer is greater than the reversed record pointer. If it is greater, that is, when moving downwards, the record pointed by the reversed record pointer plus the number of contents of the folder is stored in the record buffer at step p3332, and all of the records fro the reversed record pointer plus the number of contents of the folder plus 2 to the record pointer are moved a distance equal to each record at step P3334.On the other hand, if it is not great, that is, when moving upwards, the record pointed out by the reversed record pointer is stored in the record buffer at step P3336 and all of the records from the record pointer to the reversed record pointer less 1 are moved downwards a distance equal to each record.Then, the contents of the record buffer are restored to the position of the record pointer at step P3340, and a decision is made at step P3342 to determine whether or not the record pointer is greater than the reversed record pointer. If it is greater, both the record pointer and the reversed record pointer are subtracted by one at step P3344, but if it is small, both are increased by one at step P3346.Then, a decision is made at step P3348 to determine whether or not the loop of the above described process has been repeated a number of times equal to the number of contents of the folder, pointed by the reversed record pointer the number of documents , plus 1. If it has not been, the program flow returns to step P3330, but if has been, the number or contents of the folder is added with a value of the content buffer at step P3350 and the next succeeding step is assumed. The movement of the opened folder step P2824 is carried out according to a flowchart shown in Fig. 34. At the outset, a subroutine step P1544 for the copying of the opened folder is performed at step P3402. Then, the value of the reversed record pointer is rendered to be the value of the record pointer at step P3404. Thereafter, a subroutine see section m l for the deletion of the opened folder, which will be described later, is executed at stepP3406. m Delete The deletion of the document and folder can be accomplished by the following procedure. The deletion of the folder cannot be achieved if the folder is closed. In this case, the depression of theDelete key 533 results in the display of a direction to the effect that the folder should be opened. In the files screen step i708 displayed by the depression of the Files key 542, the cursor 31 is moved at a position of the document to be deleted steps 4722 to 5728 and then the Delete key 533 is depressed. It is to be noted that, where the cursor 31 is at a position of the closed folder, a direction reading Open folder to delete individual documents or folder is displayed at the prompt line and, therefore, theDelete key 533 has to be again depressed after the Select key 537 has been depressed to open the folder. In this way, the title of the document and others is displayed in the form as reversed and, at the same time, a direction reading Press ENTER to confirm deletion, Press CANCEL to quit is displayed at the prompt line in the form as reversed. When the Enter key 545 is subsequently depressed, the document and others are deleted and the cursor is displayed at a position of the title one line thereabove. The deletion step 740 can be executed according to a flowchart shown in Fig. 35. When the Delete key 533 is depressed, the title of the record pointed by the record pointer is displayed in the form as reversed at step P3502.Then, a decision is made at step P3510 to determine whether or not the record to be deleted is an opened folder. If it is an opened folder, and when an Enter process is subsequently carried out at step P3512, the opened folder is deleted at step P3513 and the next succeeding step P3514 takes place. If it is not an opened folder, another decision is made at step P3520 to determine whether or not it is a document. If it is a document, and when an Enter process is subsequently performed at step P3522, the document is deleted at step P3524, followed by the next step. If it is not a document, a warning sound is generated at step P3530 and the next succeeding key input is awaited. m 1 Deletion of Opened Folder The deletion of. the opened folder is carried out in a manner as shown in Figs. 36 a to 36 c . In the files screen, the cursor 31 is moved to a position of the folder desired to be deleted as shown in Fig. 36 a . After theSelect key 537 has been depressed to open the folder and theDelete key 533 has subsequently been depressed, the name of the folder is displayed in the form as reversed and a direction is also displayed at the prompt line in the form as reversed, as shown in Fig. 36 b t When the Enter key 545 is then depressed, the folder is deleted and the document within the folder is inserted in a folder immediately thereabove, as shown in Fig. 36 c . The deletion of the opened folder step P3514 shown in Fig. 35 is carried out according to a flow chart shown in Fig. 37. In the first place, the number of contents of the folder is transferred to the content buffer at step P3702 and, then, the records from the record pointer plus 1 to the last record are upwardly moved a distance equal to each record at step P3704. At step P3710, a decision is made to determined whether or not there is a folder above the record pointer.If there is, the value of the content buffer is added to the number of contents of the folder at step P3712, followed by the next succeeding step. If there is no folder thereabove, the level of the document in this opened folder is rendered to be 1 independent document at step P3720 and the value of the record pointer is increased by 1 at step P3722. At step P3724, a decision is made to determine whether or not this process has been performed a number of times equal to the number ot documents within this opened folder. If it has not been, this process is repeated. After the completion of this process, the next succeeding step is assumed. m 2 Deletion of Document The deletion of the document step P3524 shown inFig. 35 is carried out according to the flowchart shown inFig. 38. At the outset, all of the records from the record, pointed by the value of the record pointer plus 1, to the last record are upwardly moved a distance equal to each record at step P3802. Then, a decision is made at stepP3810 to determine whether or not there is a folder preceding the record pointer. If there is, the number of content the number of files of the folder is subtracted by 1 at step P3812 and the next succeeding step is assumed, but if there is not, the next succeeding step is assumed in the form as presented. n Sort In Alphabetical Order At the time of a sort process Step i744 in Fig.7 , the documents within one folder or not falling within the folder are arranged in alphabetic order. In the files screen displayed by the depression of the Files key 542, the cursor 31 is moved to a position of the folder desired to be sorted as shown in Fig. 39 a . At this time, the folder may be either closed or opened, and the cursor 31 may be located anywhere. When the Change key 532 is depressed step num 720 , the folder name is displayed in the form as reversed and a direction reading Press ENTER to begin sorting. PressCANCEL to quit is also displayed at the prompt line in the form as reversed as shown in Fig. 39 b . When at this time the Enter key 545 is depressed, and if the cursor 31 has been located within the folder, the documents within such folder are moved and arranged in alphabetic order.Should the cursor 31 have been located outside the folder, the documents within the folder are similarly arranged in alphabetical order as shown in Fig. 39 c . The sort process step Tea744 in Fig. 7 is carried out according to a flowchart shown in Fig. 40. At the beginning, a decision is made at step P4002 to determine whether or not the position of the cursor 31 at the time of depression of the Change key 532 is within the folder. If it is within the folder, and when the Enter key 545 is sseauently depressed, the Enter process Fig. 13 is executed at step P4004, followed by step P4006 during which the documents with the folder are arranged in alphabetical order. Then, the cursor 31 is moved to the position of the folder at step P4008 and the next succeeding step is assumed. If it is not within the folder or if it is a diskette name, and when the Enter key is subsequently depressed, the Enter process Fig. 13 is executed at stepP4014, followed by step P4016 during which the documents outside the folder are arranged in alphabetical order, and the cursor 31 is thereafter moved to the position of the diskette name. o Search Where the document or folder contained in the diskette is desired to be search for, the following procedure is taken. When the files key 542 is depressed, the document name, the folder name and others are displayed on the screen as shown in Fig. 41 a and a search buffer is initialized.When the Search key 543 is subsequently depressed, a search process step g752 in Fig. 7 is instituted and SEARCHMENU is displayed as shown in Fig. 41 b . Then, when theEnter key 545 has to be depressed after the name of the document of folder to be search for has been keyed in as.shown in Fig. 41 c , the display of MENU disappears and the search is executed while the cursor 31 is positioned at that position as shown in Fig. 41 d . Where the same record is subsequently search for, it is enough to simple depress the Enter key 545. Where even though the folder is closed during the search, the document to be searched for is included in such folder, the folder is opened and it is then displayed. In the event that the document to be searched for is not included in such folder, a legend Search text not found is displayed at the prompt line in the form as reversed. The search process step num 752 in Fig. 7 is carried out according to a flowchart shown in Fig. 42 composed of Figs. 42 a and 42 b . It is to be noted that characters S and i used in Fig. 42 represent the search buffer and a search buffer index, respectively. After the depression of the Search key 543, the title is keyed in at step P4202. At first, a decision is made at step P4202 to determine whether or not the key input is Cancel. If it is, the program flow returns. At step P4206, a decision is made to determine whether or not it is characters or blank. If the result of the decision at step P4206 is yes, the key input is transferred to the i th bit or the search buffer at step P4212 and after i has been incremented by 1 at step P4214, a decision is made at step P4216 to determine whether or not it is smaller than a predetermined number for example, 33 in this instance . If it exceeds N, it means that the title is composed of characters of a number greater than the predetermined number and, therefore, a warning sound is generated at step P4218, followed by the waiting for the next succeeding key input. If it is smaller than N, the next succeeding key input is awaited at stepP4202. At step P4208, a decision is made to determine whether or not the key input is Back Space. If it is, then, another decision is made at step P4220 to determine whether it is the first character. If it is the first character, another key input is awaited at step P4202. If it is not the first character, i is subtracted by 1 at step P4222, a character S i preceding one character is left blank at stepP4224, and the next succeeding key input is awaited. At step P4210, a decision is made to determine whether or not the key input is Enter. If it is not, it means that the wrong key has been depressed and, therefore, a warning sound is generated at step P4218 before the next succeeding key input is fed at step P4202. Where the Enter key 545 has been depressed, a decision is made at step P4230 to determine whether or not i is greater than 1. If i is equal to 1, it means that no character of the title has yet been keyed in and, therefore, a legend No Search text is displayed at the prompt line in the form as reversed at stepP4232, followed by the return of the program flow. At step P4240, a decision is made to determine whether or not the title pointed by the record pointer contains a character string stored in the search buffer. If it contains one, another decision is made at step P4242 to determined whether or not such title is a document included in the folder. If it is, the program flow returns after the folder has been opened at step P4244, but if it is not, the program flow returns directly. On the other hand, if no character within the search buffer exists in the title pointed by the record pointer, the record pointer is advanced one place at stepP4246, a decision is then made at step P4248 to determine whether or not the record is to be terminated, and the search is continued until it terminates. If it does not exist within all of the records, a legend Search text not found is displayed at the prompt line in the form as reversed at step P4250, followed by the return of the program flow. From the foregoing description of the present invention, it has now become clear that the document or documents can be displayed and sorted on the screen together with the folder. Therefore, the handling, arrangement and search of a number of documents can be facilitated. By way of example, the present invention provided the following advantages it Since both the folder and the document are displayed with no need to change the screen, the search of the document is easy to perform. ii A number of documents can be sorted iii . A single data diskette can be used by a nuMber of users and can accept folders of different users. iv Since the movement of the document takes place together with the folder, the document can be easily controlled. Although the present invention has been fully described by way of example in connection with a preferred embodiment thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modi ficatior.s are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart therefrom.
