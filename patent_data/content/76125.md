# Apparatus for learning autogenic training and treatment.

## Abstract
A medical apparatus for helping a subject to learn the method of autogenic training and thereby treat an affected disease himself is disclosed provides a subject with inform ing signals and physical stimuli, said signals and said stimuli being generated substantially in synchronism with each other for informing the subject with stimulus timing, and applying the stimulus to a concerned part of his body, respectively. Early in the sequence of such timing, the stimulus is completely correspondingly generated with the signal. Subsequently, the stimulus is sometimes absent from the correspondence with the signal. In each of the stimulus absent times a significant bio reaction is also caused by a conditioned reflex in the subject s physiology. This reaction is substantially the same to the normal reaction in the stimulus generating time. This will be connected with the self learning of an associated autogenic training of the subject. The stimuli may comprise a therapeutic stimulus to a diseased part and a negative stimulus to reduce the therapeutic effect of the former. The therapeutic stimulus is sometimes absent from a stable timing for aiding the autogenic training of the subject.
