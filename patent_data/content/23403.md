# A digital loop sharing communication system and a telephone instrument for use therein.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a digital loop sharing telephone system and also to a digital telephone for connection into such a system. The loop L may be for a parallel telephone system or a party line system. Each telephone instrument 10 is adapted to transmit data in an upstream direction on the loop, that is towards an exchange of the system, which data may originate from the telephone instrument itself or a further telephone instrument downstream thereof. Each telephone instrument includes code detector circuitry CD1, CD3 and logic circuitry G2, G3 whereby if the telephone instrument is the first to change to an off hook or active con dition it seizes the loop for exclusive data transmission to the exchange. In the case of a parallel telephone system, any telephone instrument going off hook can receive incoming data from the exchange but only the first telephone instru ment to go off hook can send data. In the case of a party line system only the telephone which seizes the loop can receive data.
