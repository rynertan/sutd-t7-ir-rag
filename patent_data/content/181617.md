## Description
The present invention concerns telecommunication antennas operating in the microwave range and more particularly it relates to a reflector for use in a single or double reflector antenna, i.e. a dichroic antenna capable of a selective behaviour either to different frequency signals or to electromagnetic fields with orthogonal polarization. It is known that to achieve maximum transmission efficiency in radiofrequency telecommunications systems, and chiefly, in those using artificial satellites, each antenna is to be used for the simultaneous transmission or reception of two different signals, while keeping as low as possible ohmic losses and mutual interferences. Moreover, if the antenna is installed on board a satellite its weight and encumbrance must be reduced as much as possible. A solution to this problem is that of using a double reflector antenna having a subreflector capable of generating a virtual focus for the main reflector and at the same time of allowing the operation of a feed placed in the primary focus. Of course, a new feed can be placed at the virtual focus. This can be achieved if the subreflector is selective to the frequency or to the polarization of the received or transmitted signal. In this way it is transparent at a certain frequency or polarization, allowing the operation of the feed placed at the primary focus, and is reflecting at another frequency or polarization, allowing the operation of the feed placed at the virtual focus. Moreover, in the case the antenna is used on board a satellite, the reflector structure must fulfil severe requirements of mechanical stiffness, thermal deformation and weight. Its weight must be as light as possible and its stiffness must ensure mechanical resonance frequencies higher than a minimum value, depending on the nature of the vector and on the type of support used. That is to avoid vibrations detrimental to the antenna when placing the satellite in orbit. Finally, thermal distortions, depending on sun irradiation in the orbit, have to he kept within predetermined levels in order to ensure good electrical antenna performances in the whole range of thermal variations. More particularly, in case of frequency selective subreflectors, in addition to normal electrical specifications of on board antennas, a ratio between reflection and transmission frequency as low as possible is required. That is due to the fact that the main reflector is optimised at a well determined frequency, hence, the closer the operation frequencies to the optimal frequency, the better the electrical performances in the two bands used. Now, practical considerations, depending on the bandwidth of the transmitted signals, seem to indicate in 1.5 the lover limit obtainable for the ratio above. So far, antenna systems have already been launched with frequency or polarization selective subreflectors such as those installed on board the Voyager spacecraft. In this case, frequency selectivity has been obtained with a surface consisting of a plurality of dielectric layers on one of which a plane distribution of cross like metallic elements with bidimensional periodicity has been fabricated. Such elements are usually referred to as crossed dipoles. The reflection properties of the grid depend on the dimensioning of these dipoles. The properties of transparence are, on the contrary, due to the fact that, at the transmission frequency considered, the dielectric structure is practically transparent and the grid of metallic elements is inactive. All the antennas of this kind, already placed in orbit, exhibit a ratio between reflection and transmission frequency higher than 2. It is known in the literature see e.g. Multilayer frequency sensitive surface L.W. Henderson et alii, International Symposium on antennas and propagation 1982 Albuquerque USA , pages 459 462 that lower ratios require the use of two grids of electromagnetically coupled conducting elements. In such a way, by exploiting the interference effects between the two grids, it is possible to obtain an effect of total transmission at a frequency even considerably near the reflection one. The reflection frequency remains anyway dependent on the size of the conducting elements, which may have different shapes crossed dipoles, rings, etc. The transmission frequency depends on the contrary on the distance between the two grids, which is proportional to the ratio between reflection and transmission frequencies. Polarization selectivity of the antennas now in orbit is obtained by the use of surfaces composed of a plurality of dielectric layers on one of which there is a plane periodic distribution of parallel metallic stripes. In this way the reflection of electrical fileds polarized parallely to the stripes and the transmission of orthogonally polarized ones are obtained. In all these antennas the desired electromechanical properties of the subreflector have been obtained by the use of convenient multilayer structures of composite materials, i.e. Kavlar layers, shaped like a plate or honeycomb they form a convenient mechanical support to the reflecting metallic grid. Such an antenna reflector is known from IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation, vol. AP 27, No. 4, July 1979, pages 466 473, IEEE, New York, US V.D. Agrawal et al. Design of a dichroic cassegrain subreflector . An obvious solution to the problem of making an antenna with a low value of the ratio between the reflection and transmission frequencies and convenient for use on board the satellites could consist in fabricating on a mechanical support of Kevlar, as described above, two dichroic grids separated by a convenient number of dielectric layers. However, in this way one of the grids is close to the mechanical support, whose layers made of composite materials have a rather high dielectric constant generally higher than 3. It is known that this closeness entails the lowering of the reflection frequency of the dichroic gird, which can be compensated for only by an initial grid dimensioning for higher frequencies. This requirement makes the grid embodiment more difficult when the reflection frequency exceeds about 15 GHz. Such an antenna is known from 1982 International Symposium Digest Antennas and Propagation, vol. 1, 24th 28th May, 1982, New Mexico, MX, pages 296 299, IEEE, New York, US C.A Chen et al. A dual frequency antenna with dichroic reflector and microstrip array sharing a common aperture . As mentioned, Kevlar layers assure a good mechanical stiffness, but cause a bad electrical behaviour in view of temperature variations. In fact, the dielectric constant of Kevlar is rather high and is object of great variations with the temperature, which cause the variation of the resonance frequency of the grid elements. This problem could be solved by separating the mechanical support from the set of the two grids by a dielectric layer with low dielectric constant and convenient thickness. However, such obtained structure would present a number of disadvantages These disadvantages are overcome by the reflector usable for a dichroic antenna, provided by the present invention, which reflector presents a symmetrical behaviour both from an electrical and thermomechanical point of view the structure in fact exhibits comparable ohmic losses in the two operative bands and has a symmetrical plurality of layers with respect to the median section. It also allows the use of less thick composite material layers with consequent reduction in ohmic losses and weight. The present invention provides a reflector for use in a single or double reflector antenna, the reflector comprising a first dielectric layer with high mechanical resistance, a first dielectric layer with low dielectric constant and a dielectric layer for supporting a grid reflecting the electromagnetic radiation at a first frequency or polarization and transparent at a second frequency or orthogonal polarization, characterized in that it consists of the following series of layers These and other characteristics of the present invention will be made clearer by the following description of a preferred embodiment thereof, given by way of example and not in a limiting sense, and by the annexed drawings in which In Fig. 1, R denotes the main reflector and S the subreflector. I1 and I2 denote the two feeds placed at the primary and virtual foci of reflector R, respectively. Signals reflected by R arrive at I1 after crossing S and at I2 after being reflected by S, which must therefore have a selective behaviour, as previously mentioned. Subreflector S is made with the structure provided by the invention, as depicted in Fig. 2. In Fig. 2 references 1 and 9 denote two dielectric layers of composite material, having the function of giving the whole structure the required mechanical stiffness and desired thermal properties. They directly depend on the distance between these layers and on their thickness. References 2 and 8 denote two dielectric layers of material with low dielectric constant about 1 , having the following functions References 3 and 7 denote two dichroic grids, whose elements are dimensioned so as to ensure a perfectly reflecting behaviour in the required frequency band. The elements forming the grids can be fabricated with a photoetching process of metallic layers deposited on two thin dielectric layers, denoted by 4 and 6. Finally, 5 denotes a dielectric layer with low dielectric constant, having the function of keeping the two dichroic grids at a distance such as to ensure the effect of total transmission in the transmission band. This layer, as well as layers 2 and 8, can be fabricated with plastic foam or cellular dielectric material, e.g. honeycomb material. From Fig. 2 one can understand that such a structure exhibits comparable ohmic losses in the two operative bands. Such losses are in fact basically due to crossings of layers 1 and 9, which, as mentioned, have a rather high dielectric constant and a certain thickness. In the transmission band the electromagnetic wave crossing the whole structure passes once through each of the two layers, in the reflection band the electromagnetic ware crosses twice the same layer, being completely reflected by the first grid it meets. Overall attenuation effects are hence of the same order of magnitude. In addition, such attenuations can be kept below a certain predetermined value by suitably spacing layers 1 and 9 and consequently reducing their thickness. Such a structure can be protected by suitable varnishes without their chemical composition affecting the dimensioning of the dichroic grids. The structure represented in Fig. 2 can be equally used when an only grid is sufficient, e.g. grid 7, by eliminating as a consequence layers 3, 4, 5. The already mentioned advantages in the thermomechanical behaviour can be obtained. Of course dichroic grids can be replaced by parallel stripe grids to obtain antennas sensitive to electric field polarization. The first results obtained in the preliminary dimensioning of a dichroic subreflector with a 1 m diameter show that the performances of this structure are much better than those obtainable according to the known art. It is clear that what described has been given only by way of non limiting example. Variations and modifications are possible without going out of the scope of the present invention.
