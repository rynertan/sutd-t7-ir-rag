## Description
This invention relates to a video signal editing apparatus such as VTR and more particularly to a video signal editing apparatus capable of providing for insertion edition such that new video signals can be recorded in a desired position on the magnetic recording medium on which other video signals are previously recorded. In editing video signals on a video tape recorder VTR , it becomes necessary to perform a so called insertion editing in which the pattern of the video and control signals previously recorded on the video tape or the like recording medium, or the so called base pattern, is partially rewritten or replaced by new video signals. When performing the insertion editing, the video signals on the tape start to be reproduced at a standard speed at a position tens or hundreds of frames ahead of the editing start point or so called in point and the servo data prevailing at the time immediately preceding the aforementioned in point, such as, for example, tape skew or drum rotation phase data and, for dynamic tracking head, head displacement data, are stored. These servo data are utilized for controlling dynamic tracking servo, drum servo or capstan servo in the course of the insertion editing for achieving coincidence of the tape skew and recording video phase between the base pattern and the newly insertion edited pattern. GB A 2.087.623 discloses a video editing apparatus for recording a new scene between two previously recorded scenes. For the recording the rotary head and the tape transportation is synchronized at the editing start point with the previously recorded video signal. However, when performing the insertion editing over a number of times on end, servo data discontinuities may be caused frequently at the point of returning to the base pattern, that is, ahead and back of the final editing end point or out point, thus resulting in markedly disturbed playback image. In extreme cases, servo data discontinuities are so pronounced that it becomes impossible to perform servo control and hence the electronic editing operation. For example, when producing animation tapes, that is, tapes containing animation scenes, for example, it becomes necessary to perform a continuous editing consisting of a large number of individual editing operations in which a plurality of small shots each consisting of up to 20 frames are continuously insertion recorded a number of times. At this time, since the in point servo data for any arbitrary intermediate insertion editing operation is obtained upon reproducing the immediately preceding insertion edited pattern, servo data detection error and servo control error are accumulated with the increase in the number of times of the editing operation with the result that servo data continuity is affected at the time of returning to the original base pattern at the out point of the final insertion editing thus causing so called transients in the signal pattern. Therefore, at the time of the preview operation after the end of editing, reproduced images are disturbed in the vicinity of the editing end point or out point so that it becomes necessary to again perform the editing operation. The result is the unavoidably lowered editing efficiency or image quality. It is an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus for editing video signals that avoids the aforementioned problems. It is another object of the present invention to provide a video signal editing apparatus in which the track pitch of the recorded video signals is not changed at editing points. It is still another object of the present invention to provide a video signal editing apparatus in which new video signals are inserted within the predetermined duration of the prerecorded video signals and in which video signals substantially free of transient noise can be reproduced especially at an editing end point. In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a video signal editing apparatus having the function of insertion edition and capable of recording video signals while the operating state is controlled in dependence upon the servo information or data, wherein the servo data immediately before the starting point of insertion editing and the servo data immediately after the editing end point are detected in advance of the insertion editing, and wherein the operational state is controlled during the insertion editing in dependence upon servo data obtained by proportionating calculation which is performed on the basis of the servo data at she editing start point and the servo data at the editing end point. Fig. 1 is a schematic view of the video tape and the corresponding waveform of the servo information for explaining the operation of the apparatus according to the present invention. Fig. 2 is a circuit diagram of the apparatus according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Fig. 3 is a flowchart showing the editing operation performed with the use of the apparatus shown in Fig. 2. Referring to Fig. 1, there are previously formed on a magnetic video signal recording medium such as video magnetic tape 1 video signals as well as various information signals as base pattern. It is now supposed that an insertion editing operation is to be performed on the tape 1 such that new video signals, for example, will be recorded in a tape section commencing from a position P The recording of the inserting edition such as described above is usually preceded by what is called a rehearsal mode operation according to which standard speed reproduction is performed starting from a position which is tens or hundreds of frames ahead of the in point P In accordance with the video signal editing apparatus of the present invention, not only the servo data S Thus the value Sx at an arbitrary point Px between the in point P such that the inserting recording operation is performed under the servo control based upon the thus obtained servo data Sx. During the inserting recording operation, the servo data is indicated as shown by the dotted line in Fig. 1, from which it is seen that the servo data is changed smoothly linearly from the in point P In addition to the rotational phase control data for the capstan for controlling tape skew and the rotational phase control data for the rotary drum of the rotary head unit, the aforementioned servo data may include head height control data for a so called dynamic tracking head in which tracking control is performed while dynamically controlling the height position of the rotary head, that is, the position across the track width of the rotary head. For each of these various servo data, the servo data S Fig. 2 shows essential parts of the video signal editing apparatus providing for the above operation, such as video tape recorder VTR . Referring to Fig. 2, a rotary head unit 2, a fixed head unit 3 and a tape driving capstan 4 associated with a pinch roller 5 are provided along the path of a magnetic recording medium such as video tape 1. The rotary head unit 2 is comprised of a drum on the periphery of which the tape 1 is wound and a rotating video head adapted for recording video signals on the tape 1. The video head is usually mounted on the rotary drum of disk which rotary drum is driven into rotatiion by a drum motor 6. The fixed head unit 3 is adapted for recording and reproducing audio signals and control signal CTL . The fixed head unit 3 is also used for recording and reproducing address signals indicating tape running positions such as longitudinal time code signals so called LTC signals by making use of part of the audio track on the tape 1. The capstan 4 is driven into rotation by a capstan motor 7 for driving the tape 1 while clamping the tape 1 between it and the pinch roller 5. From the drum motor 6 of the rotary head unit 2, output signals indicating the sensed values of the rotational speed and phase of the rotary unnumbered drum are supplied to a drum servo circuit 11 where they are compared with the reference speed signals and reference synch signals for deriving motor drive control signals. These control signals are supplied to the drum motor for controlling the rotational speed and phase of the rotary head unit 2. The reference synch signals are supplied to the drum servo circuit 11 by way of input terminal 12. The output signals indicating the sensed value of the rotational speed from the capstan motor 7 are supplied to a capstan servo circuit 13 for comparison with the reference signals. The output signals indicating the sensed rotational speed from the capstan motor 7 are supplied to a phase comparator 14 for comparison with reference synch signals from the input terminal 12, the resulting capstan rotation phase error output being supplied to a capstan servo circuit 13. From the capstan servo circuit 13, signals for controlling the rotational speed and phase of the motor are supplied to the capstan motor 7. It will be noted that the servo data from these servo circuits 11 and 13, such as, for examle, drum rotation phase data from the drum servo circuit 11 and capstan rotation speed data from the capstan servo circuit 13, are supplied to a microprocessor system 15. A random access memory RAM 16 is provided as memory means in the microprocessor system 15. In this RAM 16, not only the servo data S To a system controller 17 adapted for controlling the overall operation of the apparatus is connected an input output terminal unit 18 provided with such functions as display and key input functions. From this terminal unit 18, general operational mode selection signals such as recording, reproducing, fast feed or rewind, in point setting signals, out point setting signals or editing mode selection signals are supplied to the system controller 17 while, from the system controller 17, response signals thereto and operational state display signals are supplied to the terminal unit 18. To the system controller 17 are also supplied tape address signals from the fixed head unit 3 and servo status signals from the controller 17, servo control signals are supplied to the microprocessor system 15. Referring now to the flowchart of Fig. 3, there is illustrated a typical programming operation in the microprocessor system 15. As the rehearsal operation is initiated at a step 21, reproduction is effected at a standard speed at a position on the tape which is tens to hundreds of frames ahead of the in point P As the passage through the out point Po is detected at step 23, the servo data So just after passage through the out point Po is stored at step 24 in the RAM 16 of the microprocessor system 15. As the rehearsal operation proceeds in the manner as described above, reproduction of the prerecorded signals on the tape is switched during the interval commencing at in point P Thus, after the tape has been rewound at step 25 to a position ahead of the in poing P During the time the tape running position is anywhere between the in point P During the time the insertion edition or recording is performed under the servo control as described hereinabove, the servo data are as indicated by the dotted line in Fig. 1 such that there results a smooth junction with the servo data So at the out point Po that are obtained upon reproducing the original base pattern. Thus there is a smooth transition of the rotational phase of the drum or tape skew at the out point Po where the insertion edition is switched to the reproduction of the base pattern. The result is the improved continuity between the inserting recording pattern and the base pattern and markedly reduced disturbances in the reproduced image. The present invention is not limited to the above described illustrative embodiment. For example, the rehearsal operation may be substituted by any equivalent operation. Thus, when the out point deviation, that is, the deviation in the tape running position or address between the current editing operation and the next editing operation is not that high and less than about 20 frames, as is often encountered at the time of creation of animation tapes, it suffices that the servo data at the out point Po for the next editing or recording be stored in a RAM at the time of exiting from or overrunning the current editing or recording operation. This exiting or overrunning operation represents an operation equivalent to the aforementioned rehearsal operation.
