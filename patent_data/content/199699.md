## Description
The invention herein pertains to the use of N N alkylamidomethyl acetanilides to regulate the natural growth of turf grass. Many compounds are known in the art to regulate the natural growth of turf grass. Unfor tunately, most of these compounds have associated activity which prevents their widespread use. Some of the compounds are phytotoxic causing discoloration and thinning of the turf grass with the regulation of the natural growth. Other compounds suffer from unexplain able inconsistent biological activity. Still other compounds have a low margin of safety which results in phytotoxicity in overlapped areas or with incorrect usage. However, the need for such growth regulating chemicals is increasing in areas difficult to mow, such as roadsides, hills and the like. Chemicals with less phytotoxicity, more uniform biological activity, and greater margin of safety are desirable to enable effective management of turf grass. The present invention relates to a method for regulating the natural growth of turf grass by applying to the grass an effective plant regulating, non lethal amount of a compound represented by the formula The term turf grass is generally con sidered as encompassing a variety of both warm and cool season grasses which are employed in the develop ment and or management of certain areas for specific purposes, such as utility, beautification, and recrea tion. Examples of such turf grass include Tall Fescue, Red Fescue, Kentucky Blue Grass, Bermuda Grass, St. Augustine Grass and the like. Among the areas in which turf grasses are most frequently used are roadsides, golf courses, parks, and grounds which surround large educational or industrial institutions and, of course, the lawn of homeowners. In all of such areas it is readily apparent that a chemical treatment which serves to regulate the growth of turf grass is highly desirable since it will serve to minimize the time and cost expended on maintenance. A more thorough disclosure of the present invention is presented in the detailed description which follows. The present invention relates to a method for regulating the natural growth of turf grass by applying to the grass an effective plant regulating, non lethal amount of a compound representated by the formula As used herein, the term alkyl refers to both straight chain and branched chain alkyl radicals. The term alkenyl refers to both straight chain and branched chain alkenyl groups of the type The term alkoxy refers to both straight chain and branched chain alkoxy radicals containing alkyl or alkenyl groups as defined above. The term alkylthiomethyl refers to a methyl group substituted by an alkthio group. The term haloalkyl refers to an alkyl group substituted by one or more halogen atoms. Preferably, trichloromethyl is avoided. The term phenoxy refers to both substi tuted and unsubstituted radicals of the formula phenyl 0 . The term phenamino refers to both substi tuted and unsubstituted radicals of the formula phenyl NR In general, the selection of other types of substituents for R₂ is not critical to the method of the present invention and it is contemplated that other substituents such as aryl, carboxy, carboalkoxy, heteroaryl and the like would be equivalent to the compounds used in the method of the present invention. The method of the present invention involves application of an effective plant regulating, non lethal amount of the compounds to the plant locus of the turf grass. Regulating the growth of turf grass involves altering the natural growth of the turf grass to enhance various horticultural features of the grass. As employed herein, the term natural growth designates the normal life cycle of the grass in accordance with its genetics and environment in the absence of artificial, external influences. Regula tion of the growth of turf grass can include retarding the amount of natural vegetative growth of the grass and or retarding or reducing the natural formation of seedheads in turf grass. The regulation of natural growth of turf grass does not include killing or herbicidal action. By application to the plant locus is meant application to the plant s growing medium, such as the soil, as well as to the plant parts, such as roots, stems, and leaves. Preferably, the compounds are applied to establish turf grass. Application of the compounds to emerging seedlings may result in injury. It is believed that the compounds are absorbed into the plant through the roots. Therefore, it is desirable after application of the compounds to the turf to water the turf to thereby wash the com pounds into the soil. Watering of the turf is conven iently done within a short period of time after applying the compounds, e.g., within from about 3 hours to about 48 hours. A sufficient amount of water should be utilized to transport the compounds to the root zone. Depending upon the type and composition of the soil, conveniently about ¼ inch to about 1 inch of water is utilized. In selecting an appropriate regulating amount of the compound for use in the method of the present invention, it will be recognized that the effective regulating amount will vary with the plant species being treated, its stage of development, the specific compound being utilized, and the type of regulating effect being sought. The degree of regu lating effect will vary with each species depending upon the absorption, translocation, and biological activity of the compound towards the species. An effective regulating amount will normally vary from about 0.1 to about 10 lbs. per acre. Conveniently a rate of from about 0.5 to about 5 lbs. per acre will be utilized. However, those skilled in the art will be able to determine an effective regulating amount of the compound for each species of turf grass and each specific compound. In order to maximize the amount of regula tion of the growth of turf grass, it is advantageous to apply the compounds to the turf grass during the period beginning with green up and prior to initiation of seedheads. Green up is the transition of turf grass from dormancy winter phase to the active growth phase. Initiation of seedheads in the turf grass is defined as the physical appearance of seed heads at the base of the turf grass stem. Generally, it is preferred to apply the compounds to the turf grass at about 75 100 green up. Application of the compounds to the turf grass prior to initiation of green up may result in retarding the green up of the grass. Application of the compounds after initiation of seedheads will render them substantially ineffec tive in retarding the growth of seedheads. However, the compounds will still retard the vegetative growth of the turf grass. Those skilled in the art will be able to apply the compounds of the present invention to the turf grass at the appropriate time. For the homeowner, the timing of the application of the compound to the turf grass may be conveniently made after the first mowing. The compounds used in accordance with the method of the present invention appear to regulate the growth of turf grass by inhibiting new tiller elonga tion growth for a limited period of time and also inhibit further growth of established tillers for a limited period of time. However, it is to be under stood that each compound may not produce identical regulatory effects on each species or at every rate of application. Further, the visible morphological changes observed may result from a variety of physiolog ical alterations by use of each of the compounds of the present invention. The compounds for use in the method of the present invention can generally be made by reacting the corresponding unsubstituted 2 chloro N amidomethyl acetamide with a suitable alkylating agent in the presence of a base and a phase transfer catalyst. Suitable alkylating agents are alkyl sulfates, e.g., dimethylsulfate, haloalkyl alkyl ethers, halides of aliphatic and arylalkyl aromatic compounds, e.g. methyl iodide, or benzyl bromide. Suitable bases are alkali metal hydroxides, e.g., sodium hydroxide, or alkaline earth hydroxides. Suitable phase transfer catalyst are those that will form an ion pair with the cation of the phase transfer catalyst. Therefore, useful catalysts are those containing organic soluble cations such as those enumerated in U.S. Pat. No. 3,992,432, including ammonium, phosphonium and sulfon ium salts. Exemplary phase transfer catalysts include quaternary ammonium salts, e.g., aryl or aralkyl trialkyl ammonium halide salts such as benzyl triethyl ammonium bromide or chloride. The reaction is conveniently run in an inert solvent. Suitable inert solvents include dichloro methane, benzene, chlorobenzene, tetrahydrofuran, dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethylformamide, toluene, or diethyl ether. The unsubstituted acetamide is conveniently mixed with a molar excess of the alkylating agent, e.g., 1.1 to 1.5 molar equivalent excess in a sub stantial molar excess of base, e.g., 5 to 10 molar equivalent excess. Conveniently, the base is added with stirring to a cooled mixture of the acetamide, alkylating agent, catalyst and inert solvent. After the addition, the mixture is mixed for a period of time, e.g., 1 hour, conveniently at room temperature. The product can be separated from the reaction mixture using standard laboratory procedures. Conveniently, the product is separated by chromatography with a suitable eluent such as ether in hexane. An alternative method for making the N N alkyl amidomethyl acetanilides is disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,769,301 which is incorporated herein by reference. A variety of processes can be utilized to prepare the precursor unsubstituted 2 chloro N amido methyl acetamide. One convenient process comprises reacting the corresponding N chloromethyl acetanilide or the corresponding N alkoxymethyl acetanilide with the desired nitrile generally in accordance with the procedure of the well known Ritter reaction. An improved process for making the formamidomethyl acetamides involves reacting the corresponding N halomethyl acetanilide with an excess of formamide at an elevated temperature up to about 100 C for a short period of time, e.g., two hours. The product can be separated and purified as noted above. The starting acetanilides for the above precursors are well known in the art. The starting nitriles are either commercially available or may be prepared according to the procedures well known in the art. The following examples are presented to illustrate the present invention as well as some of the various embodiments of the invention. These examples are presented as being illustrative of the invention and are not intended to be a limitation as to the scope thereof. To a solution of 5.64 g 20 mmol of 2 chloro N formamidomethyl N 2,6 diethyl phenyl acetamide in 25 ml of methylene chloride in an ice bath was added sequentially 3.15 g 25 mmol of dimethyl sulfate 0.9 gm 4 mmol of benzyl triethyl ammonium chloride and 8 ml 100 mmol of 50 sodium hydroxide. The reaction was stirred for 5 minutes until completion. The reaction mixture was then diluted with 25 ml of methylene chloride, washed with 2 aliquots of 10 ml of water and one of 15 ml of salt water, dried over magnesium sulfate and evaporated to give 7.25 g of an oil. The oil was purified by flash column chromatograph with 40 ether methylene chloride as eluent to give 5.78 g of oil which crystalized upon standing to give 3.5 g of a white solid. m.p. 60 60.5 C. Analysis for C₁₅H₂₁Cl₁N₂O₂ Following the same general procedure des cribed is Example 1, but substituting the appropriate starting material, other 2 chloro N N alkylamidomethyl acetamides were made. The same or equivalent solvents and catalyst together with appropriate temperatures and times are readily utilized. Typical compounds prepared are shown in Table 1, together with certain physical properties. In this test a number of pots were planted in the greenhouse with Kentucky 31 Fescue and were grown for about 8 weeks. During this period the pots were fertilized and water and treated for disease on a regular basis. After about 3 weeks the turf grass was cut to a uniform height of about 6 cm and maintained at this height. The compounds to be applied were formulated in water and a suitable organic solvent, such as acetone or alcohol, and about 0.25 of a surface active agent was added. After application of the compound, the pots were returned to the greenhouse and watered as before. The heights of the plants in the control and test pots were measured and recorded after about 2 weeks. In the following tables, the reduction or retardation in the rate of turf grass growth induced by the compounds of the present invention is expressed in terms of the growth of the treated turf grass during the test period relative to the growth of untreated turf grass during the test period. The percent of control s growth PCG is determined in accordance with the general equation The growth of the treated and untreated turf grass as used in the above equation is the difference in the height of the turf grass before the test and the height of the treated or untreated turf grass at the end of the test period. Tables II and III sum marize the results of the tests conducted in accor dance with this procedure. As illustrated by the above example, one result of applying the compounds to turf grass is reduced height of the turf grass relative to the height of the untreated turf grass. Other desirable results include increased density of the turf grass and darkening of the color of the turf grass. The compounds in accordance with the method of the present invention can be used with adjuvants in liquid or solid form. The compositions are prepared by admixing the compounds with an adjuvant including diluents, extenders, carriers, and conditioning agents to provide compositions in the form of finely divided particulate solids, granules, pellets, solutions, dispersions, or emulsions. Thus, they can be used with an adjuvant, such as a finely divided solid, a liquid of organic origin, water, a wetting agent, a dispersing agent, an emulsifying agent, binder, carrier, or any suitable combination of these. The compounds of this invention can also be in the form of liquids and wettable powders. These preferably contain as a conditioning agent one or more surface active agents in amounts sufficient to render a given compound readily dispersible in water or in oil. The incorporation of a surface active agent into the compound can enhance its efficacy. By the term surface active agent it is understood that wetting agents, dispersing agents, suspending agents, and emulsifying agents are included therein. Anionic, cationic, and nonionic agents can be used. Preferred wetting agents are alkyl benzene and alkyl naphthalene sulfonates, sulfonated fatty alcohols, amines or acid amides, long chain acid esters of sodium isothionate, esters of sodium sulfo succinate, sulfated or sulfonated fatty acid esters, petroleum sulfonates, sulfonated vegetable oils, ditertiary acetylenic glycols, polyoxyethylene deriva tives of alkylphenols particularly isooctylphenol and nonylphenol and polyoxyethylene derivatives of the mono higher fatty acid esters of hexitol anhydrides e.g., sorbitan . Preferred dispersants are methyl cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, sodium salts of lignin sulfonates, polymeric alkyl, naphthalene sulfonates, sodium naphthalene sulfonate, and the polymethylene bisnaphthalene sulfonate. Wettable powders or dispersable granules are water dispersible compositions containing one or more active ingredients, an inert solid extender, and one or more wetting and dispersing agents. The inert solid extenders are usually of mineral origin, such as the natural clays, diatomaceous earth, salts and synthetic minerals, derived from silica and the like. Examples of such extenders include kaolinites, attapul gite clay, salts and synthetic magnesium silicate. The wettable powder compositions of this invention usually contain from about 0.5 to 90 parts preferably from 5 to 50 parts of active ingredient, from about 0.25 to 25 parts preferably 1 to 15 parts of wetting agent, from about 0.25 to 25 parts preferably 1.0 to 15 parts of dispersant, and from 5 to about 95 parts preferably 5 to 50 parts of inert solid extender, all parts being by weight of the total composition. Where required, from about 0.2 to 2.00 parts of the solid inert extender can be replaced by a corrosion inhibitor or antifoaming agent or both. Aqueous suspensions or emulsions may be prepared by stirring an aqueous mixture of a water insoluble active ingredient and an emulsification agent until uniform and then homogenized or milled to give stable emulsion or suspension of very finely divided particles. The resulting concentrated aqueous suspension is characterized by its extremely small particle size, so that when diluted and sprayed, coverage is very uniform. Suitable concentrations of these formulations contain from about 25 to 60 , preferably 35 to 50 by weight, of active ingredient, the upper limit being determined by the properties of the active ingredient. In another form of aqueous suspensions, a water immiscible component is encapsulated to form microencapsulated phase dispersed in an aqueous phase. In one embodiment, minute capsulates are formed by bringing together an aqueous phase containing a lignin sulfonate emulsifier and a water immiscible chemical and polymethylene polyphenylisocyante, dispersing the water immiscible phase in the aqueous phase followed by addition of a polyfunctional amine. The isocyanate and amine compounds react to form a solid urea shell wall around particles of the water immiscible chemi cal, thus forming microcapsules thereof. Generally, the concentration of the microencapsulated material will range from about 480 to 700 g l of total composi tion, preferably 480 to 600 g l. The microencapsula tion process referred to here is described in more detail in U.S. Patent No. 4,280,833. Concentrates are usually solutions of the active ingredients in water immiscible or partially water immiscible solvents together with a surface active agent. Suitable solvents for the active ingredients of this invention include dimethylformide, dimethylsulfoxide, N methylpyrrolidone, hydrocarbons, and water immiscible ethers, esters, ketones, or aromatics. However, other high strength liquid concentrates may be formulated by dissolving the active ingredient in a solvent then diluting, e.g., with kerosene, to spray concentration. The concentration compositions herein generally contain from about 0.1 to 95 parts prefer ably 35 to 60 parts active ingredient, about 0.25 to 50 parts preferably 1 to 25 parts surface active agent, and where required, about 4 to 94 parts sol vent, all parts being by weight based on the total weight of emulsifiable oil. Granules are physically stable particulate compositions comprising the active ingredients adher ing to or distributed through a basic matrix of an inert, particulate extender. In order to aid leaching of the active ingredient from the particulate, a surface active agent, such as those listed herein before, can be present in the composi tion. Natural clays, pyrophyllites, illite, gypsum, and vermiculite are examples of operable classes of particulate mineral extenders. The preferred exten ders are the porous, absorptive, preformed particles, such as preformed and screened particulate attapulgite or heat expanded, particulate vermiculite, and the finely divided clays, such as kaolin clays, hydrated attapulgite, or bentonitic clays. These extenders are sprayed or blended with the active ingredient to form the herbicidal granules. Granular compositions useful in this inven tion may contain from about 0.1 to about 30 parts, preferably from about 0.5 to 10 parts by weight of active ingredient per 100 parts by weight of clay, and 0 to about 5 parts by weight of surface active agent per 100 parts by weight of particulate clay. The compounds can also be added together with other additaments, for example, other growth regulators fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, safeners and the like used as adjuvants or in combina tion with any of the above described adjuvants. Although this invention has been described with respect to specific embodiments, the details hereof are not to be construed as limitations, for it will be apparent that various equivalents, changes and modifications may be resorted to without departing from the spirit and scope thereof and it is understood that such equivalent embodiments are intended to be included within the scope of this invention.
