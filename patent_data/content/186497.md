## Description
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING SILICON NITRIDE OF HIGH a CONTENTBackground of the Invention The present invention relates to a process for producing silicon nitride of high a content by nitriding metallic silicon. As the starting material for producing a silicon nitride sintered body, a silicon nitride is desirable because elongated grains are formed when there is a transition from the a phase to the ss phase thereby resulting in sintered bodies having high density and high strength. Although a silicon nitride is stable in lower temperature regions, the formation of a silicon nitride in nitriding metallic silicon has problems in the control of reaction temperature because the nitriding reaction is an exothermic one. Heretofore, a wide variety of measures have been taken for solving the problems. Such measures include, for example, carrying out the reaction at low temperatures under nitrogen atmosphere for a long period of time, mixing an inert gas such as hydrogen or argon into the nitrogen atmosphere, or mixing foreign material with the metallic silicon starting material. Further, when the temperature of the metallic silicon bed increased wildly, remedial measures for controlling the runaway were adopted such as reducing the nitridinq gas partial pressure in the nitriding furnace by means of vacuum pump or shutting don the operation of the heat source.All of the above mentioned measures heretofore employed, however, have difficulties in that the operations are complicated, or that strict limitation is necessary either with respect to the thickness of the bed of starting material or to the flow rate of the reaction gas passing over the surface of the starting material. Alsc, the above mentioned conventional process can produce silicon nitride of high a content consistently only with difficulty.Summary of the Invention The object of the present invention is to therefore improve upon the foregoing processes. Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for stably producing silicon nitride of high a content.A further object of the present invention is to provide a process for nitriding silicon in an inexpensive and simplified manner. The above objects are achieved according to the present invention by providing a process for producing silicon nitride of high a content comprising reacting metallic silicon with nitrogen in a high temperature nitriding atmosphere under the control of the pressure of the nitrogen in the nitriding furnace. The control of the pressure of nitrogen in the nitriding furnace is achieved by carrying out the reaction under a reduced pressure at a temperature in the range of 12000C to 14000C by continuously charging an approximately constant quantity of the nitrogen gas so as to maintain the nitrogen partial pressure at a predetermined reduced pressure. Thus, according to the present invention the nitriding reaction is commenced from at most 0.5 atmospheres of nitrogen partial pressure in the reaction vessel and the nitrogen partial pressure is maintained at a temperature in the range of 1200 C to 14000C at most 0.5 atmospheres until 50 of the metallic silicon has been reacted. It is essential to maintain the reduced pressure within the nitriding furnace not higher than 0.5 atmosphere until approximately one half of the starting material, metallic silicon, has been nitrided.Brief Description of the Drawings Fig. 1 shows a schematic view of the nitriding furnace to be employed according to the present invention. Fig. 2 shows a pattern of reaction temperature during nitriding reaction, and Fig. 3 shows the dependency of the reaction time upon the pressure of nitriding atmosphere within the furnace.Detailed Description of the Invention In order to obtain an a silicon nitride, metallic silicon powders must be reacted with nitrogen at a temperature up to the melting point of metallic silicon 14140C . Since the direct nitriding of metallic silicon is a highly exothermic nature as the exothermal heat generation being 180kcl mol, the increase of temperature of the reactant mass due to the exothermic nature becomes the most important consideration for the mass production of silicon nitride of high Q content.Excessive temperature increase of the reactant mass may be avoided by increasing the heat release,Such a measure, however, has limitations in that it requires z greater temperature distribution gradient in the metallic silicon bed and also in that it leads to a greater loss of energy and the like. Thus for the mass production of silicon nitride, it becomes a preregusite to control the reaction rate of metallic silicon. According to the present invention the control of the reaction rate is precisely achieved by the control of nitrogen partial pressure in addition to the control of the reaction temperature. Thus, according to the present invention silicon nitride o high a content can be Droduced by a simplified procedure comprising placing a bed or molded product of metallic silicon in an inert atmosphere of reduced pressure not higher than 0.5 atmospheres, raising it to a temperature higher than 12000C at which the nitriding commences to take place, but lower than the melting point of metallic silicon 1414 C , and thereafter assng nitrogen gas so as to maintain the nitrogen pressure in the furnace at a predetermined leve or charging nitrogen at a constant flo rate we e to the furnace. tiy the above procedures an approximatel constant reaction rate can be achieved due to the commensuration between the aot of nitrogen gas charged and the amount of nitrogen consumed, because when the reaction rate decreases the nitrogen partial pressure within the reaction vessel would increase, which in turn increases the reaction rate and conversely if the reaction rate increases then the nitrogen partial pressure within the reaction vessel would decrease, resulting in the reduction of the nitrogen partial pressure. During the reaction if the amount of nitrogen to be charged to the reaction vessel is controlled so that the exothermic heat generation resulting from the reaction is always less than the amount of heat to be released the reaction can be proceeded in accordance with a predetermined te terature pattern, that is, in the range of between 12000C and about 14000C without a runaway reaction temperature. Similarly the nitrogen partial pressure witr.In the reaction vessel can be controlled such that the nitridation effected with a nitrogen partial pressure not higher than 0.5 atmospheres at the initial s stage of the nitridation and thereafter raising the nitrogen partial pressure to atmospherie pressure thereby producing silicon nitride of high a content in a greatly reduced reaction time.It is believed that in the later stage of nitriding, the amount of unreacted metallic silicon is decreased so that a reaction rate similar to that at the initial stage can be maintained at the higher nitrogen partial pressure level. As the metallic silicon a powder having a particle size smaller than 150 mesh is preferable. If the particle size is laraer than 150 mesh the reaction becomes too slow excessively extending the reaction time which renders the process inappropriate for the commercial production of silicon nitride. As the nitrogen gas to be employed, nitrogen gas alone or a mixture of N2 and at least one of NH3, Ar, He and H2 can be employed, with nitrogen alone being preferred. The starting material, bed or molded bod refer to hereinafter simply as bed of metallic silicon should preferably have a density less than l.lg cm3. If the density is greater than l.lg cm3, the reaction rate in the center of the bed drops thereby extending the reaction time.The surface area of the bed should preferably be greater than 0.5om2 g. If the surface area is lower than 0.5cm2 g the amount of reaction heat released from the bed would be reduced thereby resulting in the accumulation of heat within the b. Such accumulation of reaction heat will reduce the proportion of a phase and induce the smelting of the starting material which would render the process unsuitable. Any reaction vessel or nitriding furance may be used if it can tolerate the reduced pressure at a temperature up to 14000C, and desirably it should be able to tolerate one positive atmospheric pressure, that is, one gauge atmospheric pressure. Furnaces such as batch kilns, shuttle kilns tunnel kilns with separate heating zones, which have means for controlling the atmosphere may be mentioned. The furnace should desirably be maintained t a temperature of at most 14000C within the furnace a .i it is desirable to provide for means or to have a structure by which the temperature distribution within the furnace can be maintained as uniformly as possible.The furnace also should desirably provide means for controlling temperature and the heating rate at less than 20C min. Such nitriding furnaces also need a pressure gauge or a pressure sensor and a gas flow controller for charging nitriding gas or gases. In the constant flow through system, it becomes a prerequisite to specify the reaction rate such that the total amount of reaction heat generated from the starting material charged within the furnace is not greater than the amount of heat released away from the metallic silicon bed. Thus the following relationship should be maintained 2M 22,4 180 x V 3 kQ , or 2 x 22,4 x t 2M 22,4 180 x V 3 t 2 x 22.4 x k x Q wherein M amount of metallic silicon charged, mol V Volume of reaction. vessel, Q , Q amount of heat to be released from the reaction vessel, Ncal min. t reaction time required for more than 988 of metallic silicon has been reacted from the commencement of reaction, min. k proportion of heat released from the metallic silicon bed on the basis of total heat released. In this system, 2 number of experiments have been done by changing the heat insulating conditions and the arrangement of the bed.As a result it was found that if k is greater than 0.2, then an adequate temperature increase could no be achieved and that if k is sraller than 0.02, practical reaction time could not be adopted. From the above findings, the reaction time should be define within the range set forth below 300M 20V t 3000M 200V Q QThe amount of feed nitrogen min. which satisfies the above relationship is set as follows 2M 3 x 22.4 V 14.9M V t tThe following examples will illustrate the present invention.

The results are reproduced in Table 1.In Table 1, the proportion of a phase and the amount of reacted Si was determined by means o x ray diffraction analsis.

Examples 1 3 Examples 1 3 explained the process wherein the pressure in the furnace was maintained at and controlled to a constant pressure of 0.75 atmospheres, 0.50 atmospheres and 0.25 atmospheres respectively. In Example 1 comparative Examp t ne nitriding reaction was almost completed but the initial reaction rate could not be effectively suppressed so that the formation of a high proportion of a phase could not be achieved.Although the apparent temperature pattern in Example 1 was similar to that in Example 2 and 3, the real reaction rate at the micro local site was greater thereby losing the balance between the generation of exothermic heat and the heat release and thus it can be assumed that the actual temperature of the bed was higher than the apparent temperature pattern.This means that the suppression or control of the initial reaction rate is critical. The reaction rate can be reduced by reducing pressure in the reaction system, but the reaction rate in Example 3, was too slow so that the reaction couldn t be completed within 5 hours following the temperature pattern. Example 2 was similar to Example 3.Examples 2 and 3 were slow in their reaction rates, so the heat of the reaction could be appropriately supressed so that it was possible to produce silicon nitride having a high proportion of a phase even when firing with nitrogen gas alone, but the reaction time was long.Examples 4 7 The procedures in Example 4 were combined with those in Examples 2 and 3. The pressure within the furnace was controlled as indicated in Table 1 and in Fig. 3,Controlling both the temperature and the nitrogen partial pressure enabled the double control of the reaction tate thereby making possible the stable and sure product of silicon nitride having a high a content. In Example 4 the reaction temperature was controlled as in Examples 2 and 3, while the nitrogen pressure was controlled as in curve 4 in Fig. 3.Approximately 70 of the metallic silicon was nitrided when the nitrogen partial pressure reached one half atmospheric pressure. Thereafter the nitrogen partial pressure was gradually increased and after 4 hours the pressure reached atmospheric pressure. After 5 hours metallic silicon was almost completely reacted and the contentofthea phase was also 95 , the nitriding ratio being remarkably improved to almost 100 . In Examples 6 and 7 nitrogen gas was passed through at a rate of 6Q min. and 4Q min. from the point where the temperatures reached 12000C. As a result the pattern of the nitrogen partial pressure followed the curve and in in Fig. 3. In these Examples, the nitrogen partial pressure reached 0.5 atmospheres at the early stage of the reaction as in curve 1 .The patterns of nitrogen partial pressure seemed to happen the process that if the reaction turns to speed up the nitriding rate, then the reaction pressure was reduced due to the consumption of a higher amount of nitrogen, and reversely if the reaction turn to slow down, then the nitrogen partial pressure was increased due to less consumption of nitrogen, and that thus the reaction was automatically controlled at the reaction rate corresponding to the flow rate passing through the furnace. In these Examples, the nitriding ratio was approximately 1008 and the content of a phase in the product was as high as 89 Example 6 and 96 Example 7 . The nitriding ratio at which the nitrogen partial pressure reached 0.5 atmospheres was approximately 60 Example 6 and 74 Example 7 . On the other hand, in Example 5 comparative Example the nitrogen was passed at a rate of 8L min. and as a result the nitrogen pressure in the furnace changed as in curve fizz in Fig. 3 and thus the nitrogen partial pressure already reached 0.5 atmospheres at a point where the nitriding ratio was approximately 45 . Due to a rapid reaction the content of a phase in the product was reduced to 70 , although the nitriding ratio was 100 . From the foregoing, it can be seen that if the reaction is controlled in the initial stage such that the nitrogen partial pressure in the furnace to thereby suppress the excessive generation of exothermic reaction heat by the control of the reaction rate, then a silicon nitride having a high content of a phase can be obtained. The reaction should be carried out in such a way that at least 50 of the reaction, preferably 608 of the reaction should take place until the nitrogen partial pressure reached 0.5 atnospheres. Ex.amr,les 8 10 Examples 8 and 9 were effected as in Example 7 by passing nitrogen at a rate of 4 min., except that the temperature increase in these Examples followed the curves Q2 and in Fig. 2 respectively, in contrast to the curve 3 in Fig. 2 for Example 7. The nitriding ratio of silicon was approximately 100t with an a phase content of 97 and 94e. In Example 10, the amount of nitrogen flow was increased to 5Q min., and the reaction was completed in 4 hours.The nitrogen partial pressure was zero atmospheres at the commencement and reached 0.5 atmospheres after 3 hours.The temperature pattern was approximately the same as in curve Dl in Fig. 2. Example 11 Metallic silicon powders 200g were subjected to nitriding as in Example 7 in the form of a molded body 25cm x 15cm x 0.5cm thickness . In this case a high content of a phase of silicon nitride was obtained. According to the present invention silicon nitride having a high content of a phase can be produced by the use of nitrogen in a simplified procedure without the use of an expensive gas such as hydrogen, argon or helium.The process according to the present invention permits the nitrogen gas consumption near the therotical amount of nitrogen for the production of silicon nitride which is very favourable from the standpoint of production cost and safety. It can also be carried out in simplified facilities.For mass production the facilities and the procedures are uncomplicated thereby permitting the stable and inexpensive production of silicon nitride of high a content.
