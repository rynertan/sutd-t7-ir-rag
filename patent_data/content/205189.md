# Electronic still camera system.

## Abstract
An electronic still camera wherein midway through an exposure the charge signals impressed by incident light on an imaging section are transferred to a storage array while the exposure continues. Corresponding signals on the imaging array and the storage arrays are differenced to form error signals which are added to or subtracted from the two original signals before they are combined.
