# Scroll type compressor with displacement adjusting mechanism.

## Abstract
A scroll type compressor is disclosed. The compressor includes a housing having a fluid inlet and outlet port. A fixed scroll is fixed within the housing and has a circular end plate from which a first wrap extends. The end plate of the fixed scroll partitions the inner chamber of the housing into a suction chamber and rear chamber. The rear chamber is divided into a discharge chamber and an intermediate pressure chamber. The circular end plate of fixed scroll has at least one pair of holes which are placed in symmetrical positions and connect the fluid pockets to the intermediate pressure chamber. The communication between the suction chamber and the intermediate pressure chamber is selective ly controlled by the operation of control means. The resistance to suction is controlled by a throttle mechanism to correspond to the movement of the control means.
