## Description
EMULSION PLOWBZ FORMULATION CONTAINING A MIXTURE OF ALACHLOR ATRAZINE AS THE ACTIVE AGENT This invention relates to an emulsion flowable formulation containing a mixture of 2 chloro 2 ,6 diethyl N methoxymethyl acetanilide commonly known as alachlor and 2 chloro 4 ethylamino 6 iso propylamino l,3,5 triazine commonly known as atrazine as the active herbicidal agent. An emulsion flowable formulation consists of three phases an organic phase discontinuous phase dispersed in an aqueous phase, the continuous phase i.e., an oil inwater emulsion, and a solid phase dispersed throughout the continuous phase.In the formulation of this invention, alachlor dissolved in organic solvent forms the organic or discontinuous phase which is dispersed throughout the aqueous or continuous phase. The solid phase, atrazine, is also dispersed throughout the continuous phase.Various formulations of alachlor are known in the art.For example, alachlor is sold by Monsanto Company as an emulsifiable concentrate formulation, and as a granular formulation. The active ingredient in the formulated state is sold under the name LASSOS herbicide. Various formulations of atrazine are known in the art, e.g., as a water base flowable, and also as a water dispersible granule. It is known in the art to tank mix alachlor and atrazine and it is further known to combine alachlor and atrazine as a one package mixture. Monsanto Company sells a one package mixture of alachlor atrazine under the tradename LASSOS AND ATRAZINE this formulation is an emulsion flowable. Monsanto also sells a LASSO ATRAZINE ready mix formulation based on trichloroethane and perchloroethylene organic solvent.Some of the limitations of the alachlor atrazine formulation based on trichloroethane and perchloroethylene solvents is the quality of the technical atrazine used in the formulation. Some atrazine sources cannot be used in this type of formulation due to the severe viscosity increase and partial gelling effect the quality of the atrazine has on the final formulation. This is particularly the case with high water content atrazine or atrazine processed by a water based procedure as opposed to an organic solvent based method. Since the quality of the alachlor atrazine solvent based formulation is dependent on the quality of the atrazine used in said formulation, the agricultural formulation is restricted in the choice of supplier of the atrazine.Surprisingly, it has been found that the formulation of the present invention allows complete freedom with respect to the quality of atrazine used in the formulation. One of the major differences between this formulation and the solvent based alachlor atrazine formulation is that more than half of the organic solvent level in the prior art formulation is replaced by water. Since the amount of solvent in the formulation is reduced, there is reduced environmental toxicological concerns due to the replacement of perchloroethylene and trichloroethane solvents by monochlorobenzene or by xylene with an overall solvent reduction of approximately 57 . The present invention offers the advantage that one is able to formulate an active agent which is readily soluble in organic solvents, i.e., alachlor, along with a solid active agent which is mostly insoluble in water or organic solvents, to produce a one package mixture wherein the amount of organic solvent used in the formulation is greatly reduced when compared to the known emulsifiable concentrate formulations of alachlor herbicide.

Berol 948 is an ethoxylated propoxylated nonyl phenol nonionic which is also suitable for use herein. These emulsifiers are manufactured by BerolKemi AB, 5 44401 Stenungsund 1, Sweden. The anionic nonionic or mixtures of emulsifiers will be present in the formulation of the present invention at from about 3.0 to about 10.0 by weight of the composition, preferably from about 4.0 to about 8.0 by weight and most preferably from about 6.0 to about 7.0 by weight of the composition. The term Stabilizer as used herein refers to a material which is used at relatively low concentrations in the formulation of the invention and which acts to prevent loss of emulsifier activity during long term storage of the formulation.

Preferred for use herein is magnesium oxide. The stabilizer will be present in the formulations of the invention at from about 0.10 to about 2.0 by weight, preferably at from about 0.50 to about 1.0 by weight and most preferably at about 0.6 by weight. Lower alkyl glycols, e.g., ethylene or propylene glycol, are used in the formulations of the invention as antifreeze agents. Amounts of these components ranging from about 1.5 to about 10.0 by weight of the composition, preferably from about 1.0 to about 5.0 by weight and most preferably at from about 1.5 to about 2.5 by weight of the total composition will adequately provide the composition with the desired antifreeze protection. Minor quantities, i.e., from 0 to about 5.0 by weight of the composition of one or more inert formulation adjuvants such as anti foaming agents, biocides, dyes, anti corrosion agents, may be incorporated into the emulsion flowable formulation of the present invention, especially if said formulations are to be stored for any extended period of time prior to use, particularly under adverse storage conditions. Silicon anti foaming agents are formulation adjuvants which are frequently used in the compositions of this invention. Silicon anti foaming agents are exemplified by the following commercially available anti foam agents Antifoam Off , manufactured byHodag Chemical Corporation, 7247 Central Park Avenue,Skokie, Illinois 60076 Mazu DF 100S , available fromMazer Chemicals, Incorporated, 3938 Porett Drive,Gurnee, Illinois 60031 Rhodorsil 426R , manufactured by Rhone Poulenc, 33 Rue Jean Goujon, 75360 Paris,France and Sag 47 , sold by Union Carbide Corporation, 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10017. From 0.01 to 0.20 by weight of the defoaming agent has been found to be useful in the present invention, preferably from about 0.02 to about 0.04 by weight of total composition is used herein. The novel emulsion flowable formulations of this invention are prepared according to the following procedure 1. The organic phase is prepared containing the emulsifier s , molten technical alachlor and organic solvent alachlor is melted at 500C and added to the organic solvent followed by addition of the emulsifier mixture. 2. The organic phase, maintained at above about 300C, is added to the water, which is maintained at 150C to 200C, under either high or low shear conditions. Typically, temperatures of 180C for the aqueous phase, and 300C for the organic phase, have been used at the moment of addition. It is important that the temperatures of the aqueous organic phases do not differ by more than about 350C as it is possible to generate a thermal shock in which microcrystals of alachlor may form in addition to oil in water emulsion droplets. The formation of microcrystals may act as nuclei for alachlor crystal growth and or instability of the formulation. 3. To the formed emulsion the following ingredients are added in the order indicated antifoam agent, antifreeze agent, and stabilizer. These components are added individually while maintaining either high or low shear agitation conditions. 4. When the oil in water emulsion is formed, technical atrazine is slowly added to the emulsion while maintaining agitation. Any shearing means known to those in the art to be capable of producing sufficient shear to produce dispersion, emulsification, and or homogenization is suitable for use herein. Illustrative of such shearing means is the 1,Polytron homogenizer, sold byBrinkmann Instruments, Inc., Cantiague Road, Westbury,New York, 11590, USA, which utilizes mechanical shearing with sonic energy to effect homogenization, dispersion, or emulsification, the Tekmar, Dispax Reactor DR 3 916 , available from the Tekmar Company,P.O.Box 372021, Cincinnati, Ohio 45222, USA and the EX Silverson homogenizer fitted with high shear emulsion head the Silverson homogenizer is available from Silverson Machines Ltd., Waterside, Chesham,Buckinghamshire, England HP5 1PQ. An example of a low shear means is a paddle agitator having a paddle blade which is 120 mm in diameter, operated at a power setting of 0.75 Kw and a speed of i 1,000 rpm. Experience indicates that final milling of the finished formulation reduces the atrazine particle size from about 6.0 to around 2.5 microns in diameter which improves the homogenity of the emulsion mixture, thereby reducing sedimentation settling upon standing. The formulations of the present invention show excellent emulsification characteristics in all water hardnesses and from water temperatures of 70C to 250C. The formulations of the invention survive one month accelerated aging at 600C without any significant deterioration in quality or degradation of active substances. The formulation of the invention will freeze at 10 C, but the extremely small trace quantities of alachlor crystals which develop after two weeks at this temperature are totally emulsified upon warming to room temperature 150C to 200C . The formulations of the invention have been satisfactorily processed using poor quality technical atrazine which would gel a solvent based emulsifiable concentrate type formulation upon long term storage. The following examples are illustrative of the concentrated emulsion flowable formulations contemplated by the present invention.
