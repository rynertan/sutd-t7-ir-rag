# Method and apparatus for removing pipe coatings.

## Abstract
Bituminous and other coatings are removed from a pipe surface by directing powerful water jets, e.g. under a pressure of 300 600 bars, and preferably under an acute angle of incidence, against such pipe surface. The apparatus has one or more nozzles 12, 12 , each provided with water supply means 15, 16, 17 , in a frame 1 that can be mounted around the pipe 3 to be treated. In a preferred embodiment, the nozzles 12, 12 are arranged in groups on rotatable annular discs 11, 11 which surround the pipe 3 with some clearance and which receive a reciprocating rotary move ment during operation, whilst the frame 1 carrying such discs 11, 11 is adapted for traveling in longitudinal direction of the pipe 3 . Both movements are coordinated, i.e. effected simultaneously and each nozzle 12 will thus follow a zigzag path along the pipe surface, thereby covering a vast area and removing bituminous or other coatings in a fast and efficient way.
