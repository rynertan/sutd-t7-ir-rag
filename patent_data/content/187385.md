# High pressure transducer.

## Abstract
A pressure transducer for in particular the measurement of relatively high pressures in the range of 10,000 50,000 psi and including an elongated frame having a capillary tube extending therethrough and employing a coupler at one end of the frame for sensing input pressure. A sensing member is provided disposed about the capillary tube at the other end of the frame and has, defined with the capillary tube, a sensing chamber in communication with the capillary tube. A recess is provided in the sensing member defining a relatively thin wall adjacent the angular sensing chamber. This wall has a pressure responsive sensing surface that extends substantially parallel to the capillary tube length and upon which strain gages are secured. A method as described for securing the capillary tube with the sensing member in a liquid tight manner.
