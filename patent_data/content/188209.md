## Description
The present invention relates to the preparation of linear dicarboxylic acids, e.g., adipic acid, by hydrocarboxylating unsaturated monocarboxylic acids, e.g., 3 pentenoic acid, with carbon monoxide and water in the presence of a rhodium containing catalyst, an iodide promoter and certain inert halocarbon solvents, e.g., methylene chloride. U.S. Patent 3,876,695, issued on April 8, 1975 to Nicholaus Von Kutepow, discloses a process for the production of adipic acid by the reaction of butadiene, carbon monoxide and water using certain rhodium carbonyl complexes along with free or combined halogen as a catalyst system. The patentee discloses the advantage of using a solvent in the system which is a nonsolvent for adipic acid and cites as operable aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g., xylene, saturated cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons, e.g., cyclohexane and saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons, preferably those having 8 12 carbon atoms. The patentee suggests introducing catalyst in aqueous solution when practicing the process continuously. In Column 1, lines 10 50, the patentee discusses representative art on the preparation of acids and esters via carbonylation. U.S. Patent 4,172,087, issued on October 23, 1979 to J. F. Knifton discloses a process for the carrbonylation and concurrent dimerization of olefins succh as 1,3 butadiene in the presence of hydroxylated correactants, a dual function palladium catalyst and a terrtiary nitrogen containing base to produce acids and ester derivatives of unsaturated carboxylic acids. The reaction of butadiene is taught to produce 3 pentenoic acid and 3,8 nonadienoic acid and their corresponding ester derivatives. The patentees do not discuss the desirability and or effect of conducting the reaction in the presence of a solvent. The catalyst system requires the presence of ligands of Group VB elements to stabilize the palladium salts. Included in these ligands are numerous phosphorus containing compounds, e.g., bis 1,2 diphenylphosphino ethane. European Patent No. 0075524, published on March 30, 1983 and assigned to Rhone Poulenc Chimie De Base, discloses a process for the preparation of beta, gamma unsaturated carboxylic acids by the carbonylation of conjugated dienes using a palladium catalyst with a halide promoter to produce the corresponding esters. Japanese Patent 92,913 unexamined published on July 23, 1979 discloses the carbonylation of lactones to carboxylic acids using a platinum group metal, e.g., rhodium, promoted with iodine compounds. The patentees do not recognize any criticality with respect to the amount of water present and employ acetic acid as a solvent. The production of 3 pentenoic acid is discussed in an article by Imyanitov et al., Karbonili rovonie Nenasyshchennykh Uglevodorodov 1968 225 32, CA U.S. Patent 3,579,552 discloses the use of rhodium catalyst with an iodide promoter to prepare carboxylic acids from olefins and other ethylenically unsaturated compounds. In Column 8, lines 31 42, the patentees disclose that an excess of water is beneficial to the reaction which, according to the teachings of the patent, is conducted using the olefins themselves or carboxylic acids as solvent. Example 9 demonstrates the employment of acetic acid as a solvent for the reaction of butadiene. In all cases a significant percentage of the products are branched. U.S. Patent 3,845,121 discloses the carbonylation of olefins, alcohols, esters, halides and ethers by the reaction of carbon monoxide, using a catalyst containing rhodium or iridium components and an iodine or bromine component, and separating the product from the mixture, without the addition of heat, by lower pressure vaporization. Carbonylation of unsaturated monocarboxylic acids is not disclosed. PCT Publication No. 84 01376 discloses carbonylation of unsaturated hydrocarbons using a catalyst containing at least one of the following metals a palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium and cobalt and b copper, in the presence of a protonic acid. Carbonylation of unsaturated monocarboxylic acids is not disclosed. The present invention is a process for the preparation of linear dicarboxylic acids, e.g., adipic acid by the reaction of unsaturated monocarboxylic acids, e.g., 3 pentenoic acid, carbon monoxide and water in the presence of a rhodium containing catalyst, an iodide promoter and certain of the halocarbon solvents which have 1 2 carbon atoms, e.g., methylene chloride, at a temperature in the range 100 240 C and a pressure in the range 14 240 atm. The unsaturated monocarboxylic acid has the general formula wherein R is selected from the class consisting of hydrogen, methyl and ethyl and n is 0 8 and preferably 0 2. The amount of water in the reaction medium is maintained at less than about 4.3 and preferably less than 3.5 by weight based upon the weight of the solvent in order to maintain catalyst activity and to assure a high yield. In one preferred embodiment 0.2 2.0 by weight based upon the weight of the reaction medium of an acid scavanger, preferably an alcohol, diol or triol, e.g., methanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol is present in the reaction medium. In the hydrocarboxylation of olefins emphasis has been placed upon the production of adipic acid directly from butadiene because this compound is an intermediate for nylon polymers. It has been found that the yield to the desired linear dicarboxylic acids, e.g., adipic acid, can be improved if the reaction is conducted in two steps. In the first step unsaturated monocarboxylic acids, e.g., 3 pentenoic acid are produced which are then hydrocarboxylated in a second step to linear dicarboxylic acids, e.g., adipic acid in exceptionally high yields and under relatively mild conditions. This application is directed to the second step. In addition, it should be noted that the selectivity to the linear acids is quite high in the process of the present invention, in most cases exceeding 50 with the principal carbonylated byproduct being α methylglutaric acid. The unsaturated monocarboxylic acids which are operable in the present invention have the general formula wherein R is selected from the class consisting of hydrogen, methyl and ethyl and n is 0 8 and preferably 0 2. Such acids include 2 , 3 and 4 pentenoic acid, 3 butenoic acid, acrylic acid, 3 hexenoic acid, and undecylenic acid. Other useful acids include 2 methyl 2 butenoic acid and 2 methyl 3 butenoic acid. The source of the reactants for the present process is not particularly critical. Commercially available grades of carbon monoxide and unsaturated monocarboxylic acids are quite satisfactory. The reaction can be conducted over a reasonably wide temperature range, but relatively mild conditions are preferred. Acceptable yield is realized at temperatures in the range 100 240 C and preferably 150 180 C. Temperatures above the upper end of the range result in a significant reduction in the conversion to diacid. At temperatures below the lover end of the range, the reaction is too slow to be economic. Relatively moderate pressures, i.e., in the range 14 240, preferably 24 40 atm are satisfactory. The partial pressure of carbon monoxide is usually maintained in the range 10 35 atm and preferably 10 17 atm. The catalyst precursor employed can be any rhodium complex that is free of interfering ligands particularly bidentate phosphine and nitrogen ligands. Rhodium complexes such as rhodium III The concentration of catalyst precursor is not critical but is usually maintained in the range 0.04 0.16 by weight of rhodium metal based upon the weight of the reaction medium. The weight of the reaction medium includes the weight of solvent internal standard, catalyst, promoter and reactants. The catalyst which can be preformed or can be formed in situ, must be promoted, preferably by iodide,to achieve a satisfactory reaction rate. Alkyl iodides having 1 7 carbon atoms are preferred promoters at the higher reaction temperatures. Methyl iodide is especially preferred. Other suitable promoters include hydrogen iodide, iodoethane, 1 iodobutane, 1,4 di iodobutane, 2 iodopropane, 1 iodopropane and iodoheptane. As believed apparent from the foregoing, the promoter and rhodium can be present in the same compound as in rhodium iodide. Generally the concentration of promoter is between 0.1 1.0 by weight iodide based upon the weight of the reaction medium and at a mole ratio to rhodium in the range 3 1 to 50 1, preferably 5 1 to 15 1. The reaction is carried out in the presence of a solvent the selection of which is critical to the present invention. Coordinating solvents, e.g., pyridine, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide and N methylpyrrolidone block the active sites on the rhodium and should be avoided. Solvents such as acetic acid are also undesirable because linear selectivity is low in their presence. Nonpolar solvents such as cyclohexane and toluene are undesirable because they promote the formation of branched products and the shift reaction, the latter resulting in the formation of undesired monocarboxylic acids. It is important that the solvent be essentially inert to the reactants and resist hydrolysis. The solvents are saturated halocarbon, except fluorocarbon and preferably chlorocarbon, solvents and mixtures thereof having 1 2 carbon atoms, e.g., methylene chloride, 1,1,2,2 tetrachloroethane, In one especially preferred embodiment from 0.2 2.0, preferably 0.5 1.0 by weight based upon the weight of the solvent of an acid scavanger is introduced into the reaction medium. Preferred scavangers include alcohols such as alkyl alcohols having 1 6 carbon atoms wherein the hydroxyl function is primary or secondary, e.g., methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, n butyl alcohol, isobutyl alcohol and secondary butyl alcohol diols having 2 4 carbon atoms, e.g., ethylene glycol, propylene glycol and butanediol triols having 3 4 carbon atoms, e.g., glycerol and 1,2,4 trihydroxybutane. Methyl alcohol is preferred. The alcohol retards catalyst degradation and permits operation at relatively higher temperatures to increase the yield of linear products without as much reduction in conversion as is normally associated with increasing temperatures. The amount of water in the reaction medium is critical to the present invention and must not exceed 4.5 by weight based upon the weight of the solvent. Preferably the water level is maintained at less than 3.5 on the same basis. The reaction can be carried out batchwise or continuously. The following examples are presented to illustrate but not to restrict the present invention. Parts and percentages are by weight and the products were analyzed by gas chromatography as the methyl esters unless otherwise noted. A 300 ml mechanically stirred reactor constructed of Hastelloy C was flushed with nitrogen followed by high purity carbon monoxide and then charged with 150 ml of methylene chloride containing 15 g of 3 pentenoic acid, 2.13 g methyl iodide, 5.0 g o dichlorobenzene as an internal standard and 1.8 g of isopropanol. The reactor was closed and the pressure therein was increased to 13.6 atm with carbon monoxide. The reactor was then heated until the temperature of the contents reached 173 C whereupon a solution of 0.40 g of rhodium chloride in 6.0 ml of water was injected into the reactor. After this injection was complete, the pressure of the reactor was increased to 27.2 atm with carbon monoxide and maintained at that pressure and at a temperature of 173 C during the hydrocarboxylation. The consumption of carbon monoxide was monitored and the reaction was terminated after two hours when the consumption of carbon monoxide ceased, approximately 95 of the theoretical amount . The contents of the reactor were recovered by cooling the reactor to approximately 20 C and slowly venting the reactor to the atmosphere. The reactor contents were removed and the reactor was washed with 350 ml of methanol under pressure at a temperature of 100 C. The wash liquid and reactor contents were combined, diluted to 500 ml volume with methanol. Analysis indicated that 97.0 conversion of the 3 pentenoic acid was obtained. The product contained 66.2 adipic acid, 17.3 α methylglutaric acid, 3.4 ethylsuccinic acid, 5.1 2 pentenoic acid and 9.4 γ valerolactone. In order to demonstrate the adverse effect of excessive water, the procedure in Example 1 was repeated, except that the isopropanol was replaced by 15 mmoles 0.95 g of methanol and the amount of water was increased to 9.0 ml, i.e., 9 g water and 150 ml CH₂Cl₂ solvent, or about 4.3 by weight based upon the weight of the solvent. Uptake of CO was 10 of theoretical after 2 hours. No additional uptake occurred after a further 3 hours, indicating that the catalyst had become completely deactivated. Product analysis showed 6.8 conversion to diacids, of which 5.4 was adipic acid 78.7 linearity . To a 200 ml shaker tube reactor constructed of Hastelloy C was charged 100 ml methylene chloride, solution containing 10.0 g 4 pentenoic acid, 2.48 g methyl iodide, 2.0 g benzoic acid internal standard along with 2 ml of an aqueous solution containing 0.264 g of rhodium chloride. The shaker tube was pressurized to 6.8 atm with carbon monoxide and the contents were heated to the temperature indicated in Table I. The pressure was increased with carbon monoxide to that indicated in Table I and maintained at that pressure for a period of one hour after no further pressure drop was observed. The contents of the shaker tube were cooled to room temperature and the tube slowly vented to the atmosphere following which the contents were analyzed by gas chromotography as the trimethylsilyl derivatives. The results are reported in Table I. Repetition of Example 2 using 1,4 diiodobutane, iodomethane, iodoethane, iodobutane, 2 iodopropane, 1 iodopropane and 1 iodoheptane as a promoter gave results essentially the same as the methyl iodide promoter. Example 2 was repeated using 3 pentenoic acid instead of 4 pentenoic acid under the conditions and with the results reported in Table I.

The procedure of Example 1 was repeated except that the isopropanol was replaced by 0.96 g methanol and the amount of 3 pentenoic acid was increased to 45 g. At the beginning of the reaction 4.6 g of water was added along with the rhodium chloride catalyst and 4.6 g of water was introduced into the reactor over a period of 30 minutes after the uptake of carbon monoxide was about 50 of theoretical. Analysis indicated a conversion of 97 , a yield to adipic acid of 67.2 and 78 linearity. The procedure of Example 2 was repeated except that the olefin was 3 pentenoic acid, the solvent was 1,1,2 trichloroethane and the reaction temperature was 170 C. The conversion was essentially 100 and the yield to adipic acid was 44.2 with 53 linearity. The procedure of Example 27 was repeated except that the solvent was 1,1,2,2 tetrachloroethane. The conversion was essentially 29 and the yield to adipic acid was 40.1 46 linearity . Example 1 was modified as follows. The reactor was charged with 150 ml of methylene chloride containing 12.9 g 3 butenoic acid, 0.37 g chlorocarbonylrhodium I dimer and 10.0 g o dichlorobenzene internal standard . The contents of the reactor were heated to 140 C and a pressure of 22.4 atm was established before the reaction was initiated by injecting 4.1 g of an aqueous solution containing 2.4 g of hydrogen iodide. The temperature and pressure were maintained as indicated during the reaction. The consumption of carbon monoxide ceased in about 20 minutes. After about 90 minutes the reaction mixture was cooled and worked up as in Example 1. Analysis indicated 45.5 glutaric acid and 22.4 methylsuccinic acid based on the butenoic acid changed. The linearity was 67 . Example 1 was repeated, except that the 3 pentenoic acid was replaced with 17.1 g of trans 3 hexenoic acid and the isopropanol was replaced by 0.48 g methanol.
