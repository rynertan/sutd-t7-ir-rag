# Method of manufacturing integrated circuit devices using dielectric isolation.

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing integrated circuit devices wherein semiconductor elements are insulated by insulation material comprising the following steps of a providing a mask pattern 3 on a predetermined semi conductor element region of a semiconductor substrate 1 b introducing by a first ion implantation impurities of the same conductivity type as that of the substrate 1 into the substrate 1 using the mask pattern 3 as a ion implantation mask c etching the substrate 1 and forming a groove 7 there using the mask pattern 3 as an etching mask in the manner that part 6 of the impurities remains under the mask pattern 3 d introducing by a second ion implantation impurities of the same conductivity type as that of the substrate 1 through the groove 7 into the substrate 1 e burying insulation material 10 in the groove 7 f forming a semiconductor element on the predetermined semiconductor element region.
