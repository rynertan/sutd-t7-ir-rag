# NUMERICAL CONTROL METHOD.

## Abstract
A method of numerically controlling a numerical control system is provided with a numerical control NC unit for numerically controlling a machine tool, or the like, and a programmable controller PC unit. When an interrupted machining operation is resumed, the NC unit 1 executes a machining program from the start thereof to a predeter mined block from which the operation is to be restarted, without any distribution operation. During the execution, data in the machining program concerning M, S, T functions is successively transferred to the PC unit 2 and is stored therein. During this time, the PC unit 2 does not deliver this data to the machine side. After the completion of the search as far as the predetermined block, the machining is resumed. This time, however, the M, S, T functions have already been automatically set in the PC unit 2 so that the conditions are the same as those at the interruption of the machining. It is therefore possible to smoothly resume the machining from the machining resumption point.
