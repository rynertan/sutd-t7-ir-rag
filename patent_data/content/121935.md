# Electrophotographic plate making material.

## Abstract
An electrophotographic plate making material compris ing a paper support and a photoconductive layer is de scribed. This paper support is prepared by providing a poly olefin resin layer on both surfaces of a paper substrate by molten extrusion lamination, and is characterized in that the volume electric resistance is not more than 10¹⁰ Ω and the polyolefin resin layer contains electrically conductive car bon black having a loss on drying, as determined under the conditions of 110 C and 2 hours, of not more than 1.0 . Using this plate making material, there can be produced a lithographic printing plate having good dimensional stabil ity and long press life.
