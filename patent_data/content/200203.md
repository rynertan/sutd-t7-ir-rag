# Slow motion device of magnetic recording and reproducing apparatus.

## Abstract
In a slow motion device of a helical scan type video tape recorder, detection is effected to detect a noise c in a reproduced signal a which is caused when the magnetic tape 1 is fed such that the magnetic heads 2, 3 which have reproduced a preceding still image at a track transfer to the succeeding track and thereafter the magnetic heads scan the succeeding track, and the position of the magnetic tape is controlled by a tape control system 14, 16, 21 so that the noise is confined within a position at which a noise bar due to the noise is prevented from being displayed on the reproduction screen.
