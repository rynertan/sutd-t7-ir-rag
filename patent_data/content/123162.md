# Hydrosilyl modified polycarbosilane precursors for silicon carbide.

## Abstract
A branched hydrosilyl modified polycarbosilane which can be pyrolized to obtain improved yields of silicon carbide. This branched hydrosilyl modified polycarbosilane can be prepared in a one step reaction from mixtures of silane monomers containing vinyl or halomethyl moieties with silane monomers containing hydrosilyl groups.
