## Description
PROCESS FOR PREPARING MUIJTI L YER STRUCTURES FROM SHEETS CONTAINING SYNTHETIC FIBRES . This invention relates to a process for preparing multi layer structures from sheets containing synthetic fibres, and more particularly to a process for preparing bonded sheets of paper or paperboard, consisting totally or partially of fibres of thermoplastic synthetic polymers. The bonding or lamination of two or more sheets of paper or paperboard with one another or with sheets or films of non cellulose materials is a commonly utilized technique, especially in the preparation of materials for packaging, for obtaining composite sheets having the combined properties of the two or more component sheets, or for preparing sheets having a high substance, not directly obtainable by papermaking machines. According to the conventional techniques, such bonding is achieved by applying an adhesive on the surfaces of the sheets and then by laminating the superimposed sheets in a press or between rollers, in order to attain the adhesion between the component sheets.Such techniques exhibit a few limitations due to the type of adhesive to be used in relation to the nature of the sheets, and to the high temperatures required, which cause degradation of the cellulose or of the other types of fibres which may be present. ore recently, the availability of thermoplastic synthetic fibres suitable for totally or partially replacing the cellulose in the preparation of paper sheets or articles has permitted the preparation of bonded or laminated articles of the type described hereinbefore starting from sheets containing more or less high percentages of such fibres. These sheets are superimposed, then heated and compressed at a temperature higher than the melting temperature of the synthetic fibres therein contained, which therefore act as bonding agents between the various layers. This method, which may be defined as the thermowelding method, exhibits however the drawback of requiring too high operating temperatures, generally exceeding by 20 300C the melting temperature of the thermoplastic polymer which forms the synthetic fibres contained in the sheets. That happens because it is necessary, for purposes of adhesion, that the molten polymer should possess a certain mobility or flowability under the process conditions. Sach high temperatures are generally prejudicial to the mechanical characteristics of the cellulose fibres, if any, contained in the sheets furthermore they make it impossible to prevent com plete melting of the remaining thermoplastic fibres contained in the structure and not involved in the adhesion between the sheets, and by consequence the loss of their fibrous morphology. Another drawback caused by the necessity of operating at such high temperatures resides in the fact that, under such conditions, a certain worsening of the mechanical properties of the sheets occurs, especially of the flexural modulus, which is particularly disadvantageous when the sheets must retain, at such temperatures, a prefixed shape, obtained for example by preceding drawing, embossing operations and the like. The present invention provides a process for preparing a bonded article by thermowelding sheets containing fibres of thermoplastic polymer, comprising the following steps I preparing sheets of fibrous material comprising synthetic fibres of at least one thermoplastic polymer, or comprising a blend of such fibres containing not more than 95 by weight of cellulose fibres referred to the weight of the blend II superimposing at least two such sheets having in serted therebetween a film of at least one thermo plastic polymer having the following characteristics a a melting temperature lower than the melting temperature of the thermoplastic polymer con stituting the synthetic fibres present in the sheets b a viscosity in the molten state of less than I x 108 poises, measured in a capillary visco simeter, at a velocity gradient less than or equal to 10 seconds, and at a temperature of from a temperature exceeding by 10 0C the melting temperature of such polymer to a temperature exceeding by 200C the melting temperature of the thermoplastic polymer constituting the synthetic fibres present in the sheets c a surface tension not exceeding by more than 5 dynes cm the surface tension of the thermoplas tic polymer constituting the synthetic fibres present in the sheets, measured at the same temperature d a solubility parameter measured at a temperature of 25 0C which is in a ratio to the solubility parameter of the thermoplastic polymer con stituting the synthetic fibres present in the sheets of from 0.85 1 to 1.15 1, extremes included III heating the laminate of the sheets and film superim posed therebetween at a temperature of from a temper ature exceeding by 10 0C the melting temperature of the thermoplastic polymer constituting the film to a temperature exceeding by 20 0C the melting temperature of the thermoplastic polymer constituting the synthetic fibres present in the sheets and V compressing the said laminate at the said temperature. It has thus now been found that it is possible tb prepare, by thermowelding operations, bonded sheets comprising thermoplastic synthetic fibres or blends of such fibres with cellulose, by operating at temperatures relatively lower than those previously necessary, if between the sheets intended for adhesion there is interposed a film of a thermoplastic polymer which has the following characteristics a a melting temperature lower than the melting temper ature of the thermoplastic polymer constituting the synthetic fibres present in the sheets b a viscosity in the molten state, measured in a capillary viscosimeter, at a velocity gradient equal to or less than 10 1 seconds, and at a temperature of from a temperature exceeding by 100C the melting temperature of such polymer to a temperature exceed ing by 20 0C the melting temperature of the thermo plastic fibres present in the sheets, of less than 1x108 poises, preferably less than 1x105 poises c a surface tension not exceeding by more than 5 dynes cm that of the polymer constituting such thermo plastic fibres, measured at the same temperature and d a solubility parameter which is in a ratio to the solubility parameter of the polymer constituting such thermoplastic fibres of from 0.85 1 to 1.15 1, extremes included, such parameters being measured at 25 C. By interposing such a film it is possible to obtain the adhesion by operating at lower temperatures than those previously required, in particular at those ranging from a temperature exceeding by 10 0C the melting temperature of the polymer constituting the film to a temperature exceeding by 20 0C the melting temperature of the polymer constituting the fibres. In this way the above mentioned drawbacks are greatly reduced or completely avoided. In particular it is possible, and even preferable, to operate from a temperature exceeding by 10 0C the melting temperature of the polymer constituting the film to a temperature equal to the melting temperature of the polymer constituting the fibres, when the melting temperature of the polymer constituting the film is lower by at least 10 0C than the melting temperature of the polymer constituting the fibres. With temperature values within this preferred range it is possible to achieve the adhesion even at temperatures below the melting temperatures of the thermoplastic fibres, without destroying their morphology. As to the fibrous material present in the sheets which are intended for adhesion, it may consist only of synthetic fibres of at least one thermoplastic polymer, or of a mixture of such fibres with up to 95 by weight of cellulose fibres, referred to the total mixture of fibres. Mineral fillers, pigments and the additives commonly used in conventional cellulose papers may be present in the sheets, admixed with the aforesaid fibrous material. The term sheets whenever used herein means both elementary sheets, i.e. not belonging to structures composed of a plurality of layers of sheets, and sheets having the above defined fibrous material composition which are part of such a multi layer or composite structure and form at least one of the external faces or layers thereof. In the latter case the adhesion between the sheets involves the adhesion between such multilayer structures, and it will be attained by inserting the polymeric film between the faces of such structures represented by the abovesaid external sheets. The remaining layers constituting the composite structures intended for adhesion, since they are not involved in the thermoadhesion process, may optionally have the same fibrous composition as the layer or sheets external to them, as defined hereinabove, or may be constituted by cellulose fibres only or by synthetic fibres only, or by blends thereof in any ratio. Therefore, by the term preparation of sheets , whenever used herein, there is meant both the preparation of elementary sheets, and the preparation by means of which the sheets are obtained as being part of a fibrous structure formed by a plurality of superimposed layers, such sheets constituting at least one of the external faces of the structure. Preparation of the sheets can be effected according to conventional papermaking methods, starting from dispersions in water, or in another inert liquid, of thermoplastic synthetic fibres, by using flat table continuous machines or continuous machines with round molds.Aqueous suspensions containing from 0.7 to 1.5 by weight of fibrous material are preferably used. The heating and compressing may be carried out simultaneously, in one step only. As synthetic fibres constituting in whole or in part the sheets to be used in the process according to this invention, it is possible to employ fibres of the conventional type in the form of staple but preferably use is made of fibrils or fibrids of thermoplastic synthetic polymers having a surface area of at least 1 m2 . Such fibrils or fibrids are products long known as substituents of cellulose in the manufacture of paper or of related products. Generally their length ranges from 1 to 10 mm and their mean apparent diameter from 1 to 500at. The fibrils employable in the present process can be obtained according to any of the several processes described in the literature. In this connection mention is male of the methods described in British Patent Nos. 8 8, and 1,287,917, and in German patent application No. 2,208,553, according to which the fibres in question, otherwise called fibrids1,, are obtained by precipitation of polymers from their solutions, or during the polymerization of the monomers, operating in the presence of cutting stresses and furthermore in British patent Nos.891,943 and 1,262,531, in US patent Nos. 3,770,856, 3,750,383 and 3,808,091, in Belgian patent No. 789,808, in French patent No. 2,176,858, and in German patent application No. 2,343,543, according to which the aforesaid fibrils are obtained in the state of more or less coherent aggregates or of fibrilled filamentary structures plexifilaments by extruding, through a spinneret, solutions, emulsions or dispersions of the polymers in one or more liquid media, in conditions of nearly instantaneous evaporation of the existing liquid phase flash spinning processes . In such a case the fibrous aggregates or plexifilaments so obtained can be easily disaggregated into continuous or elementary fibrils, having a surface area of at least 1 m2 g, by means of cutting and or refining operations. Other methods by which it is possible to directly obtain fibrils suitable to be utilized in the process of the present invention are those described in Italian patent No. 947,919 and in Italian patent applicationNo. 29,594 A 74, as well as in Britiah patent Nos.1,355,912 aDd 1,355,913. The thermoplastic fibres, and in particular such fibrils or fibrids, may contain incorporated therein inorganic fillers, such as kaolin, talc and titanium dioxide, in amounts up to 70 by weight referred to the weight of the fibres so filled. Blends of such fibres with thermoplastic fibres of the conventional type may be used as well. As cellulose fibres it is possible to utilize all the ones usually employed for making papers of the conventional type.Natural fibres of other types may also be present in the sheets as a partial substitute less than 50 of the cellulose fibres. When the thermoplastic fibres which constitute, in whole or in part, the sheets intended for adhesion are blends of fibres of different polymers, the polymer constituting the film to be interposed between the sheets must meet all the conditions from a to d defined hereinbefore, in respect of at least one of the types of thermoplastic fibres which are present or of the polymer forming such thermoplastic fibres . In the case that the individual thermoplastic fibres should be made of a mixture of polymers instead of one type only of polymer, what is specified at characteristics a to d about the melting temperatures, the surface tension values and the solubility parameters of the polymers constituting the fibres is to be understood as referred to the corresponding values exhibited by such a mixture of polymers. The thermoplastic polymer constituting the film may be any filmforming thermoplastic polymer, preferably having a crystallinity of at least 20 , provided it exhibits the characteristics a to d with respect to the thermoplastic polymer constituting the fibres present in the sheets. Examples of polymers from which the film can be prepared are the olefinic polymers, such as polyethylene and polypropylene, the vinyl polymers, such as polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate, polymethylmethacrylate, polystyrene, and furthermore the polyamides, polytetrafluoroethylene, the polyester resins, and mixtures of such polymers. The melting temperature of a polymer is assumed to be the temperature at which the disappearance of the last crystallite in the polymer is observed under an optical microscope. The solubility parameter of a polymer is expressed by the square rot of the ratio between the cohesion energy of the molecules and the molar volume, and is often used to determine the characteristics of compatibility of polymers and solvents. General methods of such determination are described by J. Brandrup and E.H. Immergut in Polymer Handbook ,Intersc. Publisher, 1966, paragraph 4, page 341 and following. A particular determination method based on the principle of additivity of the contributions of the chemical groups, atoms and bonds present in the molecules to the total molar attraction forces was suggested and described by P.A.Small in Journal of Applied Chemistry 377,1953. There is reported hereinbelow the values of the solubility parameter at 25 C of some polymers, values calculated according to P.A.Small and which are referred to for the purposes of this invention.EMI12.1 tb Polymer SEP Solubility SEP parameter tb SEP Mc tb polyvinyl SEP acetate SEP 9.22 tb polymethylmethacrylate SEP 9.22 tb polyethylene SEP 8.05 tb polystyrene SEP 9.01 tb polypropylene SEP 9.2 tb polytetrafluoroethylene SEP 6.2 tb polyvinyl SEP alcohol SEP 12.6 tb polyvinyl SEP chloride SEP 10.2 tb The thermoplastic polymer film can be obtained according to any conventional method used for film forming of the polymer, such as extrusion or molding. The thickness of the film is not critical. However, films having thicknesses not exceeding 150 r, and in particular of from 5 to 40 p, are preferable since they permit the preparation of bonded sheets with shorter dwell times at the operating temperature. The synthetic fibres present in the sheets to be caused to adhere according to the process of the present invention are preferably prepared from thermoplastic polymers having at least 20 crystallinity, such as low or high density polyethylene, polypropylene essentially consisting of isotactic macromolecules, ethylene propylene random or block copolymers, poly 4 methyl1 pentene, polyavides, polyesters, polyacrylonitrile, polyurethanes, polycarbonates, vinyl resins, such as polyvinyl chloride and polyvinyl acetate, ethylene vinylacetate copolymers, acrylic resins in general, and polyethers. When the heating step III is effected in the absence of pressure, it is possible to use for example a hot air tunnel or a hot cylinder. When the heating step is operated under pressure it is possible to use a press or a calender consisting, for example, of a roller of resilient material, for instance rubber, and of another roller of hard material, for instance steel. Preferably, but not necessarily, the heating step is operated with calenders working at from 10 to 100 kg cm2. As previously specified, the temperature at which the heating step III is effected ranges from a temperature exceeding by 1000 the melting temperature of the polymer constituting the film to a temperature exceeding, at the most, by 2000 the melting temperature of the thermoplastic fibres present in the sheets, it being understood tat such fibres, in the case of multilayer structures, are the thermoplastic fibres present in the layers or sheets which are in contact with the film surface. The actual temperature at which the heating is carried out is selected within the defined range, from amongst those at which the polymer constituting the film assumes the previously defined values of viscosity b and surface tension c , in case such values would not taRe place at all the heating temperatures comprised in the above mentioned range. In such a case the temperature at which bonding is achieved, according to the heating step III , may be established on the basis of preliminary determinations of the viscosity and surface tension carried out on the polymer constituting the film. The process of the present invention permits the preparation of papers or paperboards of any weight.Furthermore, the papers so obtained, having the same weight as compared with papers of cellulose only, or with mixed papers of cellulose thermoplastic synthetic fibres, which have been subjected to heat treatment until melting of the synthetic fibres occurs, exhibit higher mechanical properties in dry conditions, although retaining the same thermoforming properties of the latter papers, even at a higher weight. The process can be also utilized, with the same substantial advantages, for bonding sheets in which the synthetic fibrils have been previously thermo molded prior to their superimposition by heating and optionally by simultaneous or successive compression of the sheets, and have tilerefore lost their fibrous morphology. The invention will be further described with reference to the following illustrative Examples. EXM lE 1 There was prepared a dispersion in water of a fiber blend consisting of 80 by weight of Graft cellulose and 20 by weight of fibrils of high density polyethylene having a melting temperature of 1350C , the fibrils having the following characteristics weighted mean length 3 mm mean apparent diameter 16 P surface area 5 m2 g. In order to promote the dispersibility in water, the surfaces of such fibrils had been treated with acetalized polyvinyl alcohol, according to the process described inItalian patent No. 1,006,878. From such a dispersion, having a fibre concentration of 4 by weight, sheets having, after drying, a weight of 200 g m2 and a thickness of 300 r were prepared in a flat paper machine. Between two such sheets was interposed a film having equal dimensions and a thickness of 20 which consisted of low density polyethylene density 0.906 having a melting temperature of 1100C.Such polyethylene exhibited, in the temperature range of from 12D0 C to 155 C, a viscosity below 0.8 x 105 poises, determined in a capillary visccsimeter, at a velocity gradient less than or equal to 10 seconds, and furthermore a surface tension equal to that of the high density polyethylene constituting the fibrils, and a solubility parameter in a ratio of 0.98 to that of the polymer constituting the fibrils. The laminate of sheets and film was made to pass through a heating tunnel wherein it was brought to a te perature of 1350C and while at such a temperature it was then conveyed, at a speed of 10 m min, between the two rollers of a calender one of which was made of rubber having a hardness equal to 800 Shore, and the other of which made of steel , where it was subjected to a pressure of 100 kg cm2. The resulting product was then subjected to an adhesion test between the component sheets. For this purpose, a sample strip of the product, having a width of 5 cm and a length of 180 cm, was opened in proximity of an edge by detaching the sheets, and the resulting edge was drawn at a speed of 10 cm min, in order to separate 10 cm of one sheet from the other sheet, the strength necessary for such purpose being recorded. In the present case such strength was found to be 200 g cm. EXAMPIE 2 comparative test Sheets of the same weight as those of example 1, bwt consisting only of Graft cellulose refined at 280 SR, were bonded, with the polyethylene film described in example 1 inserted therebetween, according to the same procedure and conditions. The adhesion strength of the final product was found to be 50 g cm. Operating under heating in a calender at a speed of 1 m min instead of at 10 m min, an adhesion strength of 60 g cm was measured in respect of the final product. EXAMPLE 3 comparative test Example 1 was repeated, except that no polymeric film was inserted between the sheets intended for adhesion.The adhesion strength determined in respect of the final product was not measurable being practically nil at any speed, or dwell time, of the bonded article in the calender. This operation was repeated at a heating temperature of 1500C the result obtained was the same. By means of successive tests and using the same sheets without inserting any polymeric film it was ascertained that it was possible to attain adhesion between the sheets, with an adhesion strength equal to 200 g cm, only by heating and calendering at a temperature of 170 C. At such a temperature there was complete melting of the fibrils contained in the sheets as well as a weight loss of the cellulose, due to thermal degradation, of about 0.5 by weight, compared to an almost nil, or not measurable, weight loss when it was operated under the conditions of example 1. The flexural modulus of the bonded articles, determined at 170 C, was lower by 30 than the value measured at 1350C. EXAMPLE 4 According to the procedure described in example 1, sheets were prepared consisting of 80 by weight ofKraft cellulose fibres and 20 by weight of polypropylene fibres melting temperature 1650C , having a weighted mean length of 2.5 mm, a mean diameter of 18 P and a surface area of 3 m2 g. The sheets had a weight of 200 g m2 and a thickness of 3OO . Two such sheets were superimposed with a high density polyethylene film melting temperature 135 C having a thickness of 20 P inserted between them. The laminate of sheets and film was brought to 160 0C in a hotair tunnel, and then conveyed at such temperature to a calender similar to that utilized in example 1, where it 2 was calendered under a pressure of 80 kg cm , at a speed of 20 n minute. The polyethylene constituting the film utilized exhibited a viscosity, determined as previously explained, less than 1 x 105 poises in the temperature range from 1450C to I850C, a surface tension higher by 2 dyne cm than that of the polypropylene fibrils, and a solubility parameter in a ratio of 0.92 1 to the solubility parameter of the polypropylene constituting the fibrils. The adhesion between the sheets in the final product was 22 g cm.EXAMPLE 5 Two paper sheets were prepared, each composed of a 2 layer having a weight of 100 g m and consisting of 10 of high density polyethylene fibrils similar, as regards morphology and characteristics of the polymer to those of example 1, and 90 of raw Kraft cellulose, and of a second layer having a weight of 80 g m2 and consisting of 65 by weight of such polyethylene fibrils and 35 of such cellulose. Each sheet was heated at 150 0C in a hot air tunnel and then conveyed at such temperature to a calender operating at a pressure of 100 kg cm and consisting of a steel roller cooled down to 50 0C and of a counterpart in the form of a rubber roller hardness 800 Shore . Structures were obtained in the form of two layer sheets where the fibrils were no longer identifiable. 2 Such structures had a weight of 177 g m , a thick ness of 250at and a Ring Crash Test R.C.T. value, according to standard SCAN P 34 71, of 1.2 K.Newton m. The resulting two layer sheets were superimposed with a low density polyethylene film having the same characteristics as that utilized in example 1 inserted therebetween, so that the film surface was in contact with the surface of the sheets or layers containing 10 of molten fibrils of polyethylene. The adhesion of the laminate was achieved under conditions identical with those described in example 1 for the same operation. After adhesion the bonded 2 articles had a weight of 374 g m , a thickness of 500 , and a R.C. T. value of 5.1 K.Ne on m. A paper sheet of cellulose only of the same Kraft 2 type, having a weight of 180 g m and a thickness of 280 , exhibited a R.C.T. value of 1.9 KN m a paper sheet of the 2 same type of cellulose having a weight of 380 g m and a thickness of 570 P exhibited a R.C.T. value of 4.5 KiVin.
