# A latex composition and an element containing a polymer layer derived from the composition.

## Abstract
A latex composition comprising a continuous aqeuous phase having dispersed therein core shell polymer par ticles characterized in that the core polymer represents 80 to 95 weight percent of the entire particle and has a glass transition temperature greater than 70 C, and the shell po lymer represents 5 to 20 weight percent of the entire particle and has a glass transition temperature from 25 C to 60 C. The latex may be used to form an overcoat for a photogra phic element which is resistant to ferrotyping.
