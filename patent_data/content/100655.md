The above issued patents form a foundation and background for the present application and are included by reference into this specification. SL nary of the Invention The basic functions of a data link processor or intelligent I O interface control unit as it was previously called in the cited patents is to provide the specific processing and control functions for data transfers between a specific peripheral and a main host computer system. There has newly been developed an improved peripheral controller data link processor which, instead of being individually designed and oriented for one particular type of peripheral, now has isolated certain common function elements for all types of peripheral controllers to form a data link processor of improved capability. The common toall unit is designated as the Common Front End CFE which forms a basic part of the data link processor ThisCommon Front End, when used in conjunction with a PeripheralDependent Logic Board PDB which adapts the data link processor to a particular peripheral unit is known as aCommon I O data link processor. The line control processor peripheral controller in U.S. Patent 4,162,520 was described as an input output interface data transfer control unit. While many of the general overall operating functions remain the same in regard to following the commands of I o descriptors from the main system and the returning of Result Descriptors to the main system, the improved peripheral controller now designated as the data link processor DLP provides a PROM with micro code words for use of the required control function rather than the complexities of processor plurality of multiplexors used in the peripheral controller line control processor described in U.S. Patent 4,162,520. The peripheral controller, working in conjunction with a main host system, receives control data and print data to be printed via a peripheral printer mechanism having a print train of characters . The peripheral controller Data Link Processor also returns control data to the main host system. The interface between the main host system and peripheral controller is the Distribution Control card. In order to control direction of data flow from Distribution Control card to peripheral controller or vice versa, a line turn logic circuit has been developed to control the direction of flow. This logic circuit comprises.a PROM, a hex register and a tri state buffer. A series of six input signals to the PROM provides four output lines which. feed the hex register. The register provides two direct output controi lines and two lines to the tri state buffer. which outputs two output control lines. The output control lines determine direction of flow to or from the Distribution Control card. Additionally, the output control lines may also determine data flow to from a Maintenance Card for diagnostic purposes. Thus, upon initiation of a maintenance mode , the maintenance card connects to a bidirectional bus where the direction of diagnostic test data is controlled by a second set of receivers and drivers which receive control s.ignals from said line turn logic circuit.

The overall environment or system configuration in which a data link processor, such as a Train Printer Data LinkProcessor TP DLP operates, is shown in FIG. 1. The main host computer system 10 having a host dependent port 10 p connects message level interface buses 15. to specialized peripheral.controllers such as data link processor DLP 2010 and 2011 through a distribution control card 20id. Likewise, the message level interface lSi connects to a distribution control card DC 20ode which supports a plurality of other data link processors, such as the Train Printer DLP, 2003, FIG. 1. In the particularly preferred system embodiment fc theTrain Printer Data Link Processor, the DLP 2003 FIG. 1 is connected by bus 101 to a Train Printer mechanism peripheral such as is described in Burroughs Corporation publiration form 1094802 copyright 1976 by Burroughs Corporation, Detroit,Michigan 48232 FIG. 2 shows a more generalized situation in which a host computer 10 is connected by a message level interface 15i to two base modules 200 and 201. Each of these base modules has its own respective distribution cards DC respectively designated 200d and 201d Each base module supports a plurality of data wink processors peripheral controllers .For example, base module 29o may have a console data link processor 2000 which controls a console unit 50c Likewise, data link processors 2001 2 02 may respectively handle control and data communication transfers between items such as a card printer, card punch or other peripheral units. Each particular data link processor is specifically oriented for serving the requirement of each type of peripheral unit. Likewise, base module 201 has its own distribution card DC 201d which can connect to data link processors such as 2pro, 2O11, each of which data link processors is specifically tailored to handle the data transfer and control operation for a particular type of peripheral terminal unit Each base module will b seen to have its own maintenance card unit 20or for base module 20o and maintenance card 2OIm for base module 201 . The maintenance card provides diagnostic and maintenance coperations for the data link processors of a given base module. As previously described in U.S. Patents 4,106,092 and 4,162,520, each base module has a series of backplane connectors and.grooved slides whereby a large number of printed circuit component cards may be inserted and slid in for connection to the backplane of the base module. Thus, the distribution card 200d, the maintenance card 20 and other printed circuit cards.which constitute the peripheral controllers or other function cards, may be inserted and connected into the common backplane of the base module FIG. 3 is a schematic illustration of how a specific data link processor peripheral controller may bR physically structured with slide in printed circuit cards.Thus, a Common Front End card 10C is seen having a series of backplane connections lOb, for connection to the motherboard.of the base module, and having frontplane or foreplane connectors 80at, 80bl, 80cm and DLP address jumper pins 83 which are used to set the specific address of the particular data link processor DLP involved. Connected to the CFE card 10c by means of the foreplane connectors is the Peripheral Dependent Board PDB card 80. This card has foreplane connectors 80aX 80b 80C, which connect to its associated Common Front End CFE card 10c. The Peripheral Dependent Board 80 also has a foreplane connector 80d for connection to the Train Printer Peripheral unit. The PDB card 80 has jumper pins 82 for identification ID whereby an encoded identification signal for the board can be effectuated. Thus, the specialized data link processor peripheral controller as 2003 can be seen to comprise two slide in cards, one of which, the Common Front End card 10c, is common to all types of peripheral controllers while thePeripheral Dependent Board, PDB card 80, is a specialized card providing the circuitry functions required for the control, handling and specialized protocols particularly required for a specific type of peripheral unit OVERALL SYSTEM DESCRIPTION As previously discussed in U.S. Patents 162,52Q and 4,106,092, use was made of an nput output subsystem operating between a main host computer and one or more peripheral devices.The input output subsystem used a plurality of base module cabinets, each of which supported a group of base modules. The base modules consisted of up to eight Line Control Processors peripheral contro . lers wnich were designated as intelligent input output processing units which controlled data transfers between any specific peripheral device and the main host system.Since these Line Control Processors LCP provided an identification code or data link l for each task assigned by the main host system, these Line Control Processors came, in subsequent design, to be known as Data Link Processors DLP and henceforth will be referred to by the term ofData Link Processors. The data link processor I O subsystem interfaces a variety of peripheral I O devices with one, csrr more thanone, host system. This setup simplifies the IXO device maintainability by allowing maintenance of the I O subsystem to be performed without being specifically tailored to the vagaries of main host systems. The data link processor subsystem is distinguished by its adaptability to any host computer system having the MLI message level interface capabilities described in U.S. Patents 4,162,520 and 4,106,092. The data link processor I o subsystern can be utilized by host systems having totally different internal characteristics, for example, the same I O subsystem may be shared by any combination of different Burroughs B 900 systems, as the B 2900, B 3900, B 4900 and the B 6900 system. The message level interface is a connected line discipline by which the host system or host systems communicate with the I O subsystem. In the preferred embodiment of the latest configuration, each of the host systems utilizes a unit called a Host Dependent Port HDP to achieve the message level communication. The peripheral devices which are attached to and operate with a data link processorI O subsystem operate in a semiautonomous environment, that is, a host system faust initiate a peripheral device to perform an operation, by sending the data link processor an I O descriptor. After the DLP is initiated, it DLPss performs the operation OP independently of the host system. At the conclusion of the operation, theDLP reconnects back to the host system which initiated the operation and returns information called a 1 result descriptor R D . During this operation, the DLP can reconnect to the host system to transfer data via the data link processor. The ability of a pLP to disconnect from a EQSt system and proceed with an I O transfer operation frees the host system to perform other operations during the time that an ItO transfer operation is in progress within the data link processor subsystem. The ability to reconnect to a host system requires the data link processor to contain a linking mechanism to re establish the comrnunication path between the peripheral device and the host system that initiated that peripheral device. The logic circuit that provides for this reconnection is contained in the data link processor. Alternatively the logic circuit that providers for this connection and reconnection may be contained in a system controller SC or a unit such as the IOT input output translator unit, described in the aforementioned U.S. Patents .Every peripheral device that is connected to the DLP I O subsystem uses one of this type of connection reconnectionlr control devices. The message level interface that connects the host system to a DLP I O subsystem is capable of conducting all communication between the host system and the peripheral subsystem including connection, reconnection and disconnection. Two types of communications are made use of between the host system and the I O subsystem. These are a control communications done by control levels and b data transferring11 communications. In both types or ccamunication information either control levels or data pass between the host system and the peripheral subsystem. When information passes from the rain host system to the DLP I O subsystem, the operation is described as a Write operation. when information is passed from the I O subsystem to the main host syStem, the operation is described as a Read operation. For example, when a peripheral device requests to be reconnected to the remain host sys. . or to another available main host system, che comrnicaton starts in the I O subsystem with infornation passed on to the host system and is, therefore, a Read type of operation.When a host system initiates a peripheral device and the communication starts from the host system with information being passed from the host system to the peripheral, this is called a Write type of operation. Those peripheral devices of the input type will produce only Read data for the host system. Those peripheral devices of the output type will only receive data from the host system, i.e., a Write data operation.Thus, input or output peripheral units require either a Read data or a Write data operation. Read data andWrite data are not the same thing as read or write operations because read or write only describes the direction of the flow of information on the message level interface. A read function performed by an input peripheral device requires a Write operation to initiate the peripheral device first, followed by a Read operation to pass the data to the host System. As described in U.S. Patent 4,074,352, the LCP base module is the basic building block for an input output subsystem. In the case where a universally Common FrontEnd card is used in each data link processor DLP , the subsystem can be designated as the Common I O Subsystem . The DLP base module consists of a backplane which connects slide in cards, any two of which form a DLP. A base module cnsists or one to six Distribution Cards 3C for cc..mun cation to from the system and houses from one to eight data link processors DLP s , each of which handles data communications to from a specific peripheral .er L nal unit. Each base module also includes one Maintenance Card MC , two termination boards and space for additional cards for specialized purposes, but which are not essential to a normal operating situation. Each data link processor DLP consists of a CommonFront End card CFE and peripheral dependent logic which is located on separate circuit board known as the PeripheralDependent Board PDB . Read only memories designated asPROMs located on the Common Front End card contain micro code words which are the only elements dependent on the type of peripheral device used, the remaining of the elements. being standard independent components. The Common Front End card and the Peripheral Dependent Board communicate to each other via three 50 pin frontplane connectors seen in FIG. 3. The data link processor 2003, FIG. 1 contains the hardware and power required to interface the host dependent port 10p of the main host system 10 with a plurality of peripheral devices 53. The hardware of the subsystem consists of a base module as 200, FIG. 2, which include the following 1. a control console 50c, FIG. 2 2. the message level interface cabling MLI , Is 3. the base backplane 20OB for the data link processors, FIG. 3. the base modules which fit into the cabinet and connect to the base backplane 5. the data link processors DLP which are typUc9.9 organized such that 8 data link proces Qrs. are supported by each of the base modules FIG. 2 . As described in the heretofore mentioned patencs, the base modules were fitted with one or more Distr buton Cards DC depending on the number of host systems which could be connected to that base module, plus a termination card and a Maintenance Card MC . As described in the afore cited patents, the poll test is defined as the procedure used by a host system and its host dependent port to establish commun cation with a DLP subsystem. The host system initiates a connection to a data link processor by performing a poll test sequence. The result of this sequence is as follows 1. a connection is made from the host system to the data link processor that also includes the status condition of the addressed data link processor.2. a signal indication that a particular data link processor is not active in that particular DLP address, that is, the DLP is not physically present, or it has been taken off line by the Maintenance Card, or it is unavailable because of a PROM parity error. 3. a signal indication that another Distribu ion Card DC is actively engaged in the particula base module and thus a path to the requested DLP is not available at this time. L, a signal indication that the address requested did not carry the proper parity. To begin a poll test , the host system 10 sends aChannel Select to the particular base module that it has selected to be connected. The Channel Select signal provides an indication to the Distribution Card DC that it has been selected for a poll test. The host system sends the address of the DLP on data lines D 8 MSB, most significant bit through D l LSB, least significant bit . A LEM line expansion module card can be connected to a base module to enable 16 DLPs to be connected to a single MLI 15i. A BCC base control card can be used to provide identity signals for a base module. If a line expansion module lem is in use, the host system sends the Distribution Card the address of the requested base module on data lines C S MSB through C l LS3 . If a base control card BCC is to be addressed, then bit A 8 is used. The host dependent port HDP then sends Address Select to all of its base modules. This causes the Distribution Cards that receive the ChannelSelect to begin a poll test, and signifies to all otherDistribution Cards that the host system interface is busy.This busy indication is needed by non connected DistributionCards to resolve Distribution Card priority in handling DLP requests for connection in situations where there is a multiple Distribution Card base environment. The Distribution Card DC , whicn is selected by che Channel Select and the Address Select signal, acknowledges by returning a DLP strobe signal back to the host system 10.If another Distribution Card is actively engaged on the base module backplane, or a Distribution Card of higher priority is also taking a poll test connection, then a port busy indication accompanies the acknowledge signal. If the vertical parity carried on the address is incorrect, a parity error indication accompanies the acknowledged signal. If the base module is available for connection and the address parity is correct, then the host system receives only the acknowledge signal. The Distribution Card addresses and connects to the addressed DLP. The Distribution Card connects with the selected DLP by decoding the DLP address and driving one of eight address lines. The DLP specified by the address line has the address receiver jumpered to the correct address line. The DLP receivi.ng this address sends a DLP connected signal LCPCON back to the host system to indicate its presence. Upon receiving an acknowledge signal, and no indication of a port busy or parity error signal, the host system drops its Channel Select signal. This makes all lines available for connected communication. However, if an exception condition is reported, the host system must disconnect from the DLP. When the Distnbution Card detects the absence so a Chancel Select, it sends another acknowledge strobe signal If the DLD addressed, has responded with LCPCON, theDistribution Card enables the DLP s status signal to the host system with this second acknowledge . With the second acknowledge, the DLP and host system are connected via the Distribution Card. If the selected DLP did not respond because it was off line or not installed the host system receives together with the acknowledge signal a DLP status signal of zero indicating that the DLP is not available. If the DLP is unable to handle a poll test at this time because it is busy the DLP status indicates this condition. It is the function of the host system to detect and to respond to this condition by disconnecting or converting to a poll request. The connection established with this poll test remains intact as long as address select remains true. The DLP participation in the poll test host system connection routine is minimal. The DLP only receives its unique address line and returns LCPCON in acknowledgment and enables the status line. If there are multipleDistribution Cards installed in a base module, then access to the backplane of the base module is achieved by a request granted mechanism in the path selection module PSM . The PSH also provides for Distribution Card priority resolution. POLE TEST TO POLL REQUEST CONVERSION If the hcst system 10 is performing a poll test, and the initial DLP status indicates that the DLP desires access to the host system for information exchange because of a previous I O descriptor, the host system has three options a disconnect b selectively clear a DLP c handle and service the DLP If the option c is selected, the host system converts to a poll request . A poll request is defined as the procedure used by a data link processor to establish communication with a host system.A poll request is the opposite of a poll test because the origination of the communication is reversed, that is, with the DLP being the transmitter and the host system being the receiver and responder. In conjunction with any initial status in the read direction information flow toward the host system the Distribution Card sends the DLP data toward the host systen. If the initial status is Send descriptor link this data .is the first word of the descriptor link and contains the host return field. The host system must check this field to be certain that it can handle the DLP information transfer. If the host system cannot handle it, the DLP must disconnect before sending any host system strobes DLP INITIATED CONNECTION POLL REQUEST When access is required to the host system and a disconnection has occurred, the DLP re establishes connection by initiating a poll .ec es. sequence. Because all DLP s may request connection at the same tine, a decision is made on a priority basis.PrIority is partitioned into two types a global priority, and b base module priority. The global priority of a DLP is based on the type of peripheral device which it services. There are 6 standard levels of global prority for DLPs. The global p ori.y of a particular DLv is assigned with regard to the host system access requirements of the peripheral device, such as speed, stream mode, etc. An additional and higher level of global priority is provided to designate an emergency request. This is designated as global priority equal to 7. An emergency request is defined as a condition requiring irnmadiate access to the host system in order to avoid difficulty in error recovery or operator action. Global priority is used by the main host system to determine the priority of each requesting Distribution Card. Base module priority is the priority of each DLP within the base. Base module priority is used by the Distribution Card to determine tbe priority of each requesting DLP. Base module priority is determined by the DLP number of each DLP in the base module. This number corresponds to the DL address jumpered on each DLP, for example, the DEP address 7 is equal to DLP number 7 which is equal to the base module priority equal to 7. The established priority levels are arranged such that the highest basemodule priority is 7 while the lowest is 0. Only one DLP within each base module is assigned to each priority number.Thus, a base module has been organized to contain a maximum of up to 8 DLPs. To begin a poll request, .he DL raises che request level jumpered to one of eight DLP request lInes in theDLP, depending upon and equal to tha address af tho DL . Upon detecting a DLP request, if the host system is idle, the Distribution Card raises an interrupt request to the host system. When the host system detects TneeX pt Request it sends Access Granted to all the base modules and begins a poll request sequence. Access Granted allows all Distribution Cards that have requests on line to begin poll requesting. Access Granted also signifies that the message level interface MLI is busy to all DistributionCards that are not reqeusting.CONNECTED STATE In the connected state, the DistributionCard DC provides the communication path between the hQst system and the selected data link processor. All communication between the host system and the base moduleis asynchronous. This requires that send acknowledge on the message level interface be pulses rather than levels.The host system send acknowledge AC SIO and the DL send acknowledge LCPST are pulses on the message level interface MLI . The base module of the I O subsystem can support up to eight data link processors which are mounted on slide in cards which connect to the backplane of the base module.In each base module facilities are provided for slide in cards which can be installed and which work with the data link processors and the main host system. These cards may be summarized as follows Distribution Card doc The Distribution Card provides an electrical and functional interface between a given DLP base module and a host system. The circuitry of this card provides host system connection for 1 8 data link processors DLPs .The routines for establishing a connection between a givenDL and the host systen are impl mented by logic circuitry contained on the Distribution Card. A connection can be initiated by either the host system or by a data link processor. When the host system initiates the connections, this is designated as poll test when the data link processor initiates connections, these are designated as poll requests . All communications bet ween a host system and a base module are asynchronous. The Distribution Card synchronizes this communication. The Distribution Card provides for the capabilities of up to.6 transfer paths into a base module from one or more host systems. Each separate path into a base module requires a separate Distribution Card, if a multiple configuration is used, then a card known as thePSM or path selection module is required. Once aDistribution Card has provided a connection between the host system and a selected data link processor, the DistributionCard assumes a connected state and then becomes practically transparent to communication transfers between the host system and the selected data link processor. PATH SELECTION MODULE PSH The path selection module is a card inserted into the base module and is required when the base module contains two or more Distn buton C .rds. The path selection module governs access to the base backplane, and it selects and routes the DLP request in adition to also handling Master Clear of all base modules and in addition to Selective Clear of selected base modules.

TERMINATION CARDS Each DLP base standardly requires two termination cards TC . These cards are designated as numbers 1 and 2 and contain the required transistors and capacitors in order to properly balance and load the base module backplane lines.MAINTENANCE CARD Since a single backplane is provided in common for all of the data link processors of a given base module, this permits a large proportion of the BLP maintenance to be centralized. This centralized maintenance circuitry is located on the Maintenance Card that is installed at one end of the DLP base module opposite from the position of the Distribution Card . The Maintenance Card contains the clock generation circuitry for the entire base module, in addition to other maintenance circuitry, such as circuitry for diagnostic procedures. These diagnostic procedures include the ability to simulate the peripheral interface, to control the clock to the data l nk processor, and to access the storage elements of the data link processor for comparison with standardly expected results. As stated, the clock generation logic circuitry of the entire base module is located on the Maintenance Card.Since every card in a given base module receives this signal, the actual signal distribution has been divided into two lines in order to halve the driver requirements. The actual clock is an 8 megahertz, 507. duty cycle positive pulse on the DLP backplane.DATA LINK PROCESSOR DLP A data link processor provides the control logic and the host system interface function for the associated peripheral units which it services. The DLP logic that controls the peripheral device is device dependent therefore, some DLPs contain different hardware andfor different micrc codes. Communication with the main host system is via the message level interface by way of theDistribution Card. Requests for host system access originate from a data link processor. The DLP disconnects from the host system while transferring information to or from the peripheral device it services. A DLP consists of two or more cards generally 10 by 13 inches each . Each card can contain a maximum of 96 TTL chips arranged in a 6 x 16 array.The cards plug into adjoining slots in the base module backplane. A data link processor is made up of aCommon Front End card CFE and one or more PeripheralDependent Boards PDB . The CFE and first PDB are connected together by three foreplane connectors, containing 50 pins each FIG. 3 . If more than one PDB is required for a CFE, then the PDB cards are connected .o each other by a fourth 50 pin foreplane connector. The CFE card contains the necessary logic to store and execute the micro code that is dictated by the particularPeripheral Dependent Board being used. Random access memory RAM chips and programmable read only memory PROM chips.are located on the Common Front End card.The unique logic required by a particular peripheral device is located on the PDB 80 and can vary according to the particular type of peripheral device being serviced. On the other hand, the CFE 10 is a standardized card which provides functions common to all types of Peripheral DependentBoards and peripheral devices serviced. The function of the DLP is to interface a particular peripheral device to the main host system. The required co munication between the host system and the DLP is standardized in method and content. Every DLP communicates to fhe main host system using this standard discipline.The DLP masks the peripheral idiosyncrasies from the host system. Thus, the DLP is independent of the host system because of this. The data link processor performs its peripheral controlling functions in response to information received over its interface to the host system. Data link processor communication with the host system is accomplished by use of standard DLP 1status1, states.These status states indicate to the host system the requirements of the DLP at any given unit of time . Once a connection is established between a data link processor and a host system, all in orm.a cn .rans ers are performed as indicated by the DLP status signal. Thus, the entIre communication process is oriented about the DLP and is DLP status driven 1. The status state signals are common for every type of data link processor. This has been described in detail in U.S. Patent 4,162,520. Every data link processor contains a message buffer of a size sufficiently applicable to ics associated type of peripheral device. Data transmissions between the DLP and the host system operate to and from this message buffer.This eliminates access errors for peripherals having fixed record lengths such as card readers, printers or card punches. Stream mode devices such as tapes and disks contain and utilize two or more buffers to accomplish variable length message transfersDLP STATUS FLOW SIGNALS The D7P status flow is designed to allow orderly message transfers. When it is said that the host system is DLP status driven , this means that the DL indicates its requirements to the host system by sending its status state signal. These status states are transmitted continuously by the DLP once it is connected to the host system. The host system examines these status lines atDLP send acknowledge time. Every DLP implements this common signal flow in a manner designed to provide as much commonality as possible so that each DLP will have a standardized routine. Status states are generated for host system usage only they are no used logically by theDLP. They are used to make the host system aware of the internal operation routine of .he DLP. Thus, this allows the host system to anticipate somewhat the requirements of the DLP. STATUS STATE SIGNALS FOR THE DATA LINK PROCESSOR As was previously described in Patent No. 4,162,520 cn column 70 and in connection withFIG. 6A and Table VII, each condition or situation of the operating routine of the DLP will have a MnaTnonic and a status state c3UNt number . In the present system which uses the data link processor and a host dependent port, HDP, rather than the input output translator IOT of the above mentioned patent, the following Table O SS outlines the description of each of the status states of the data link processor in a generafized, sense. It will be seen that each of the states follow the same routine pattern of that shown for the earlier line control processors. Slight variations in meaning occur for each type of DLP.according to the type of peripheral it services. A specific table for the Train Printer DLP will be presented hereinhafter. TABLE O SS Generalised Pattern Status Mnemonic Status State Usage or Meaning Count Cleared STC O Entered by the DLP when it is cleared. This status is also shown if the DLP is not present, it has a PROH parity error, or it has been taken off line by the Maintenance Card.Disconnect STC 1 Used by the DLP to indicate that no more transfers are possible during the connection, or to indicate that the DLP is unable to accept a new I O descriptor.Reserved STC 2 Reserved for expansion. Detection of this status results in an error.Idle STC 3 Indicates that the DLP can accept a new I O descriptor, or that a DLP receiving this new descriptor requires additional descriptor words.Read STC 4 Indicates that data is being transferred to the host systen by the DLP.Send Descriptor Link StC 5 Indicates that the descriptor link is being sent to the host system Receive Descriptor Link STC 6 Indicates that the DLP needs to receive, or is receiving the descriptor link.Result Descriptor STC 7 Indicates that the result descriptor is being sent to the host system.Write STC 8 Indicates that the DLP needs data from the host system.Encoded Status STC 9 Indicates that the DLP is sending special status information on the data lines.Port Busy STC 10 The host is waiting on port busy, but the LEM has a request from another DLP.I O Descriptor LPW STC Il Indicates that the DLP requires the I O descriptor LPW.Break STC 12 Indicates the end of a data message, and the DLP now wants an LPW.Break Enable STC 13 Indicates the desire by the DLP to transmit another message to the host system. The host system may accept or refuse this request.Character Transfer STC 14 Used by certain DLP s to resolve the contents of the last data word that has been received from the host systei. Result Descriptor LPW STC 15 Indicates that the final word of the result descriptor is being sent to the host system and is followed by the appropriate LPW. INFORMATION TRANSFERS All information transfers between the DL I O subsystem and the host system are asynchronous and accomplished by means of control strobes. On the other hand, transfers between Distribution Card and theDLP are synchronous. The various types of information transfers ara briefly described herenurAer. SYSTEM TRANSMIT When information is ready to be sent to the I O subsystem, the host system emits a pulse SIO to the DLP I O subsystem When the subsystem has received data it then emits a pulse LCPST over to the host systen. At this point the next transfer takes place beginning with a SIO signal. Resynchronizing of the asynchronous signals occurs in the Distribution Card DC . Upon receipt of the host system strobe, the Distribution Card synchronously sets the STIOL level to the DLP. STIOL is synchrononsLy reset when LCPSTL is true from the DLP. The answer to the host system occllts as soon as LCPSrL is rrue from theDL . If this is the case, STIOL is tiue for only one clock period and the host system strobes are immediately answered. Data from this system is latched in theDistribution Card on the trailing edge of the host systems. strobe. SYSTEM RECEIVE Wren the host system can accept another word of data from the DLP I O subsystem, it emits a pulse SIO to the subsystem. In turn, when the subsystem is capable of sending a new word it emits a pulse LCPSTL to the host system. Upon receipt of the host system strobe, he 9Zs..aution Card synchronously sets the STOOL level to indicate that a new cycle can begin. The new cycle is completed and the host system is .strobed when LCPSTL is true and STIOL is synchronously reset. LCPSSt can be true before the SIO is received.If this is the case, STIOL is true for only one clock period and the host system s strobe pulses are immediately followed by subsystem strobe pulses with new data. Data to the host system is latched in the Distribution Card on the leading edge on the subsystem strobe pulse to the host system.LINE TURN In the course of a message transfer, it is sometimes necessary to change the information direction. The host system and the DLP coordinate in this turnaround of bi directional lines. The DLP controls the data direction in the base module with a backplane line calledI O send IOSND . I O send., when low, directs the data lines toward flow into the host system. The DLP initiates the line turn with a status transition that requires a change in information direction. Two situations occur here 1. Host.System Transmit to Host System Receive If the host system detects a status changed when it receives an acknowledge on the information transfer that requires it to receive information the host system sends another strobe to acknowledge the status change . The DLP detecting the host systems acknowledge raises the I O send and begins transmission to the host system. 2. Host System Receive to Host System Transmit If the host system acknowledges an information transfer in conjunction with a status change that requires a line turnaround, the DLP inactivates the I O send and sends another DLP strobe to the host system. When the host system receives the acknowledge that the base lines have been turned , then the host system begins to transmit to the DLP.DLP BASE ADDR SS As the DLP base backplane is made up of common lines running the length of the base, the printed circuit cards, which form the DLP, can function in almost any set of slide in card locations. The base address chosen for a DLP is jumpered on the DLP card FIG. 3 .The base address serves only to make the DLP unique within the base. The DLP s global priority is not affected by its base address. This priority is selected on the Distribution Card DC . There are two backplane line functions that are linear the bLP reqúest. and the DLP address. They are allocated eight lines each O 7 . The request and address jumpers mustt correspond. DLP ID IDENTIFICATION Upon receiving a TEST ID OP code, the DLP returns a two word result descriptor R D The second word contains DLP ID information. Digits A and B of the ID word are a predetermined bit pattern specifying the type of DLP. Digits C and D of the ID word are a bit pattern specified by field installed jumpers and are used to uniquely identify the DLP.The ID word fcr the DLP is formatted as follows EMI32.1 tb SEP A SEP s SEP C SEP D tb SEP I tb 1111111fl t tb SEP 2 SEP I SEP I SEP a SEP 4 SEP I SEP I SEP I SEP I SEP 1, ,,14 SEP I SEP Z tb SEP flELD tb te SEP FIX D SEP WE SEP SEP b SEP 8 ALLED tb SEP JuLa, tb I O DESCRIPTORS The I O descriptor is transmitted in 17 pa aer 5 cs including odd parity. The DLP Or codes are limited to he following rour types 1. Read 2. Write 3. Test 4. Echo Operations that do not transfer data are considered test . Thus, a test is defined as an operation that results in the host system receiving a result descriptor only.Echo is a maintenance operation that causes the BLP to accept a buffer load of data from the host system, and then return it back to the host system. This allows a quick confidence check of the I O data path as far as the DLP buffer is concerned. Also, the various translation logics can be checked by an echo operation. DLPs that require further information associated with the basic operations obtain that information in the form of variants., The first I O descriptor transfer contains the four OP code bits and up to 12 variant code bits. Further variants are transferred in 16 parallel bit increments and are not limited to any size. RESULT DESCRI TORS A result descriptor is transmitted to the host system along 17 parallel bits including odd parity.The first tour bits one digit of the first word of theDLP result descriptor are common for every DLP. These first four bits are shown as follows Bit Significance A8 Not ready peripheral A4 I O Descriptor error A2 MLI Vertical parity error Al MLI longitudinal parity error The B, C and D digits of the DLP result descriptor will vary according to the type of data link processor involved. FIG. 4A shows a block diagram of the Common Front End, 10 , which is sometimes designated as a Common I .O unit . The maintenance control bus 30, coming from the Maintenance Card 20 provides input to a receiver 15 which has one om output to the address multiplexor 12 and another output on bus 37 to the peripneral dependent board PDB 80. The Distribution Card data bus 32 provides input to receiver 16 while line 31 provides another input RCV to receiver 16 from the peripheral dependent board 80. One output of receiver 16 is fed to the address multiplexor 12 while the other output forms bus 36 as a data bus to the PDB 80. Receiver 17 has one input from the Maintenance Card data bus 34 and another control, SIMRCV simulate receive input line 33 from the peripheral dependent board PDB 80.Receiver 17 provides an output to the address multiplexor 12 and an output to the data bus 38. Bus 35 from PDB 80 provides another input to the address multiplexor 12, while the low order address bit AO from thePDB 80 on line 36 provides an input to the PROM 13. PROM 13 provides a bus to the PROM register 14, which register also has an input from AND gate 24 which has two inputs one of which constitutes the PROMCLK line and the other input is from the parity check circuit 18 to signal whether or not a parity error has been detected. PROM register 14 has an output on bus 40 for maintenance display signals and connects to the common backplane of the base module. Another output of the PROM register 14 connects to the Request Status Latches circuit 19 which feeds its output to drivers 20 to provide signals designated IOSF I O Send flip flop Status, REQ request and DREQ emergency request which are interrupts to the host. This bus also connects to the common backplane. The PROM register 14 outputs include the control lines of bus.43, the PDB usage bus 44 and the multiplexor enable bus 45, all of which connect to the peripheral dependent board, PDB 80. A Random Access Memory or RAM buffer storage 22 will be seen having four sets of inputs from the peripheral dependent board 80. These inputs are the chip select Line 50, the writ e enable line 51, the RAM data in bus 52 and theRAM address bus 53. The output bus of RAM 22 is designated as the RAM data out bus which connects to the peripheral dependent boÅard 80.COMMON FRONT END CARD CFE Referring to FIG. 4A which shows a block diagram of the Common Front End CFE lOCs the central operative element of the Common Front End is the PROM controller and storage unit 13. The PROM storage 13 consists of 13 separate PROM chips which may have a total storage capacity of 1024 52 bit words. This includes odd parity. As seen in FIG. 4A the Common Front End also contains the receivers 15, 16 and 17, for the data link processor DLP interfaces with the Distribution Card on data bus 32 and the maintenance card on control bus 30. The enabLe signals for these buses are driven by the peripheral dependent board XPDB 80. The data link processor RAM storage buffer 22 has a capacity of 1024 17 bit words which includes odd parity.The RAM storage unit 22 is controlled entirely by the peripheral dependent board 80 FIG. 5A .

DISTRUTION CARD ThTERFACE As previously indicated in FIG. 2, data link processors are housed in a base module unit. Each data link processor, consisting of two cards, slides into the base module housing having a common backplane to which the printed circuit boards of a data link processor are connected. All communications between the Common Front End 10 and C the Distribution Cards such as 20od 201d are performed through the data link processor base module backplane as 2OoB of FIG. 3.The backplane is common to all cards that are installed in a base module. Table II shows a list of all the backplane signals that occur on the Distribution Card interface to the Common FrontEnd. The 17 bit wide data portion of the bus 32, FIG. 4A, is received from Distribution Card DC on the Common Front End CFE . This same 17 bit bus is driven in the opposite direction by drivers on the PDB when the data link processor is sending data back to the Distribution Card. The enabling levels that control the direction of this bus are generated on the peripheral dependent board. However the Train PrinterData Link Processor, working with an output only type peripheral, Train Printer does not send data back but rather receives data for printing.

These consist of a console 50c which may include a cathode ray tube CRT, a mini disk, etc. and the Maintenance Card, as 20 , plus other software packages and hardare which are included in the DLP. Under progrnmmatic control, the console 50e can be used to manipulate the DLP in such a manner as to determine its internal state for given operations and to compare it to a known correct state by use of the Maintenance Card 20 omThus diagnosis of a failing DLP can be made. The console is the interface between the host system and the host system operator, as well as being the maintenance interface to the I O subsystem. Maintenance of the TrainPrinter Data Link Processor originates at the console, when in the off line mode and from the host system, then in the on line mode of operation. A data base can be supplied on flexible diskettes or magnetic tape to perform diagnosis of the data link processor DLP . The selection of the test and type of module can be done at the host system by a field engineer or a host system operator.DIAGNOSTIC TESTING MODES There are two modes of diagnostic testing, a off line and b on line. In either mode the units undergoing tests are not available to the host system as a resource and must be placed off line prior to running diagnostics. Diagnostic programs use the console to maintenance card interface in the diagnosis of the subsystem modules. These programs can perform a card test on the addressed unit by means of a maintenance data base that is stored on flexible diskettes or is resident in the host syste .. OFF LINE MODE This mode implies the following 1. The host systems rescurces are not available . 2. The test data base is console diskette resident 3. The operator must supply control information, ON LINE MODE This mode implies the following 1. The host systems resources are available 2. The test data base is host system resident 3. A host resident program performs the diagnosis Confidence test programs can be developed which use the message level interface CMLI to ascertain a confidence level of the I O subsystem unit or units under test. These tests may be used to isolate a failing unit so that maintenance can be invoked to determine if the cause of the failure is in an I O subsystem module or in the peripheral device. PERIPHERAL DEPENDENT BOARD INTERFACE As seen in FIG. 3 the peripheral dependent board PDB and the Common Front End card are provided with foreplane connectors 80a, 80b, 80C, 80d and 80a1 S0bl, 80cl. The interface between the Common Front End and the peripheral dependent board is made of three 50 pin foreplane connectors 80a, 80b and 80c. Table IV lists the connectors and shows the pin numbers together with the logic names of the signals involved specifically for theTrain Printer Data Link Processor.TABLE IV CFE FOREPLANE CONNECTORS FOR TRAIN PRINTER DLP EMI61.1 tb SEP PIN SEP num SIDE SEP SIDE tb CONNECTOR SEP NUMBER SEP SIGNAL SEP SIGNAL tb SEP 1 SEP 00 SEP RAMA4 SEP RAMPAR tb SEP 1 SEP 01 SEP RAMA1 SEP RAMA8 tb SEP 02 SEP RAMB4 SEP RAMA2 tb SEP 03 SEP RAMBI SEP RAMB8 tb SEP 1 SEP 04 SEP GND SEP RANT2 tb SEP 1 SEP 05 SEP RAMC4 SEP RANCH tb SEP 1 SEP ops SEP RAMC1 SEP RAMC2 tb SEP 07 SEP RAMD4 SEP RAMD8 tb SEP 1 SEP 08 SEP RAMDl SEP RAMD2 tb SEP 1 SEP 09 SEP INRAMB8 SEP INRAMA8 tb SEP 1 SEP 10 SEP INRAMB4 SEP INRAMA4 tb SEP 1 SEP 11 SEP INRAMB2 SEP INRAMA2 tb SEP a SEP 1 SEP 12 SEP INRAMBI SEP INRAMA1 tb 1 SEP 13 SEP INRAMC2 SEP INRAMC8 tb 2 SEP 1 SEP 14 SEP INRAMC1 SEP INRAMC4 tb u SEP 1 SEP 15 SEP SIMRCV SEP RCV tb SEP 1 SEP 16 SEP DBUSA4 SEP DBUSA8 tb SEP 1 SEP 17 SEP DBUSA1 SEP DBUSA2 tb SEP 1 SEP 18 SEP DBUSB4 SEP DBUSB8 tb SEP 1 SEP 19 SEP DBUSB1 SEP DBUSB2 tb SEP 1 SEP 20 SEP GND SEP DBUSC8 tb SEP 1 SEP 21 SEP DBUSC4 SEP D8USC2 tb SEP 1 SEP 22 SEP DBUSC1 SEP DBUSD8 tb SEP 1 SEP 23 SEP DBUSD4 SEP DBUSD2 tb SEP 1 SEP 24 SEP DBUSD1 SEP DBUSPR tb SEP 2 SEP 25 SEP WE SEP GND tb SEP 2 SEP 26 SEP RAMAD9 SEP CS tb SEP 2 SEP 27 SEP RAMAD7 SEP RAMAD8 tb SEP 2 SEP 28 SEP RAMADS SEP RAMAD6 tb SEP 2 SEP 29 SEP GND SEP RAMAD4 tb SEP 2 SEP 30 SEP RAMAD3 SEP RAMAD2 tb SEP 2 SEP 31 SEP RAMAD1 SEP RAMADO tb SEP 2 SEP 32 SEP GPRIF SEP PERF tb SEP 2 SEP 33 SEP IOSF SEP DSEL8 tb SEP 2 SEP 34 SEP DSEL4 SEP DSEL2 tb TABLE IV CFE FOREPLANE CONNECTORS FOR TRAIN PRINTER DLP EMI62.1 tb SEP PIN SEP num SIDE SEP SIDE tb SEP CONNECTOR SEP NUMBER SEP SIGNAL SEP SIGNAL tb SEP 2 SEP 35 SEP DSEL1 SEP Sil tb SEP 2 SEP 36 SEP GND SEP CONECT tb SEP 2 SEP 37 SEP GND SEP LOCAL tb SEP 2 SEP 38 SEP 6ND SEP CLR tb SEP 2 SEP 39 SEP GND SEP SEMREQ tb SEP 2 SEP 40 SEP INRAMD2 SEP INRAMO8 tb SEP 2 SEP 41 SEP INRAnD1 SEP INRAMD4 tb 2 SEP 2 SEP 42 SEP TEST14 SEP INRAMPR tb 2 SEP 2 SEP 43 SEP TEST12 SEP TEST13 tb SEP 2 SEP 44 SEP TEST10 SEP TESTil tb SEP 2 SEP 45 SEP GND SEP TEST9 tb SEP 2 SEP 46 SEP TEST8 SEP TEST6 tb SEP 2 SEP 47 SEP TESTS SEP OFFLN tb SEP 2 SEP 48 SEP AF SEP BUFFEND tb SEP 2 SEP 49 SEP GND SEP CLKEN tb SEP 3 SEP 50 SEP OPDEC4 SEP OPDEC8 tb SEP 3 SEP 51 SEP OPDEC1 SEP OPDEC2 tb SEP 3 SEP 52 SEP SEL61 SEP TERMF tb SEP 3 SEP 53 SEP SEL4 SEP SEL5 tb SEP 3 SEP 54 SEP GND SEP BR6 tb SEP 3 SEP 55 SEP num L3 SEP num L4 tb SEP 3 SEP 56 SEP num L1 SEP num L2 tb SEP 3 SEP 57 SEP num K3 SEP num K4 tb SEP 3 SEP 58 SEP num K1 SEP fK2 tb SEP 3 SEP 59 SEP num J3 SEP num J4 tb SEP 3 SEP 60 SEP num J1 SEP num J2 tb SEP SEP 3 SEP 61 SEP num 13 SEP num 14 tb SEP SEP 3 SEP 62 SEP num 11 SEP num 12 tb SEP 3 SEP 3 SEP 63 SEP num H3 SEP num H4 tb SEP ZWW SEP 3 SEP 64 SEP num H1 SEP num H2 tb SEP SEP 3 SEP 65 SEP STOPB SEP num G4 tb SEP 3 SEP 66 SEP num CONST6 SEP G3 tb SEP 3 SEP 67 SEP num CONST4 SEP num CONST7 tb SEP 3 SEP 68 SEP gCONST2 SEP num CONST5 tb SEP 3 SEP 69 SEP num CONSTO SEP num CONST3 tb SEP 3 SEP 70 SEP GND SEP num CONST1 tb SEP 3 SEP 71 SEP num BRANCH3 SEP num BRANCH2 tb SEP 3 SEP 72 SEP num BRANCH1 SEP SEL3 tb SEP 3 SEP 73 SEP SEL2 SEP GNO tb SEP 3 SEP 74 SEP GND SEP AO tb The following Table V is a listing of the signal lines connecting thePeripheral Train Printer to the peripheral connector on the PDB card 80.TABLE V Signal Lines Between Train Printer and Peripheral Dependent Board PDB 80 .

The address lines of the 13 PROM chips are bused together so that all of the individual address lines are common to every single chip. The chip select on eachPROM chip is allays enabled grounded . The data output of the 13 chip PROM matrix forms the 52 bit word. This word is read out of the address that is present on the common input address line AO A9 FIGS. 4A, 5A .The PROMs herein are basically unclocked devices so that means is required to synchronize their outputs with an eight megahertz clock which feeds through gate 24. This is done by making use of register chips 14, The register chips contain eight flip flops each. Thus, seven chips are used to synchronize and latch the 52 bit micro code word. This latched micro code instruction word is used to control the operation of the entire data link processor. Every eight megahertz clock pulse latches the next subsequent word into the register chip 14. Different types of data link processors require their own unique micro code. Thus, all Common Front End cards will contain identical hardware except for the 13 PROM chips.Although the PROM word physically contains 32 bits, only 49 bits are used by the micro code program. The remanding three bits are not party checked. Tables VIa and Vib indicate the 49 bit micro code word, by bit position and name. All PROM output signal names are preceded by a pound sign num so that they are easily recognizable. Bit 32 of the micro code word is the odd parity bit. The CFE card is made to continually check for odd parity and it halts the micro code program if a parity error even parity occurs on any 49 bit PROM micro code word.

Receiver 17 is used for operation of the maintenance control lines 33, 34. Table VII shows the addressing signals for maintenance mode of the data link processor. Thus, thisTable lists all possible Maintenance Card to Common FrontEnd addressing codes with the response of any given data link processor. The Maintenance Card MC has the ability to address any one of eight DLPs in the base module.

It will be seen that all backplane signals are low active.The other four address lines provide encoding for DLP selection. The CFE does not decode the maintenance address until the Maintenance Card indicates the address is valid and stabilized by driving ADRVLD 0 low. The Maintenance Card drives four lines which are used to enable unique maintenance features in any given DLP or connection module. When in local mode, the CFE uses one of these lines SWR.l .0 for allowing the Maintenance Card to drive the address lines of the CFE PROM 13. When this line SU7H.1 .0 is low, the peripheral dependent board drives RCV high and drives SlMRCV low, as well as not driving the 17 line data bus 32. Table VIII shows a list of the Maintenance Card lines which drive the PROM address lines in this local mode. This feature or the maintenance operation is used to verify PROM controller 13 integrity.

This buffer memory 22 has a specifically designed organization for use in control of the Train Printer mechanism as seen in FITS. 5B and Sc. This RAM buffer data RAM consist of 1,024 17 b t words. All inputs and outputs to this ijuX are received by or driven by the peripheral dependent board PD3 30. The designation for the open collector line 60 nanosecond read access RAM is RWON. This storage area is used to store the data, tileOP code, the descriptor links, the descriptor links longitudinal parity word LPW and the various flags that are required to properly control the operation of the data link processor.DLP ADDRESS ND REQUEST JUMPERS There are eight backplane lines which are used by the Distribution Card s to address any one given data link processor DIP . Likewise, eight backplane lines are used by the data link processors DLPs to indicate a service request to the Distribution. Cards. The 16 lines are unique in that only one data link. processor. DLP can use a given reques t line. Further, the request lines are graded by priority. Once the priority of a data link processor is determined, that priority request line is jumpered for use on the Common Front End Card FIG. z 3 . The request and the address lines are identically numbered and operate as pairs. Therefore, once a request priority level is determined and jumpered, the corresponding address line is jumpered on the Common Front End Card. nL LOCAL ADDRESS JUMPERS The Colon Front End Card requires minimum of two and a maximum of three jumpers FIG. 3 to implement its local maintenance address. This address is used by a Maintenance Card, as 20or to address a data link processor as 20 . The data link processor s local address must always oo correspond to its on line DLP address.STACK REGISTER The stack register 11 consists of three binary counter chips. This register contains the value of the current PROM address, or the value of the address to be used when returning from a subroutine by way of a stack branch operation. The Train Printer Data Link Processor will be seen to be made of two slide in printed circuit cards. These are the Common Front End CFE card and the Peripheral DependentBoard PDB . Each of these two boards are totally different in function and structure however, when they are used together they make up the totality of the Train Printer DLP. The primary function of the CFE 10 is to provide a device in which to store and execute the applicable micro code. The micro code is used to sequence the operation of the data link processor DLP . The Random Access Memory RAM2 is housed on the Common Front End Card and provides internal data link processor storage for various uses such as data storage, translation storage, etc. The peripheral dependent boars PDB , on the other hand, contains the necessary logic to interace the peripheral device as, for example a Train Printer to the host system through the message level interface MLI . The message level interface 15i will also be seen in U.S. Patent 4,162,520 in FIGS. 1A, 2 and 3 . The logical elements of the PDB are controlled by using the micro code coming from the Common Front End CFE . However, also, many signals are passed from the peripheral dependent board to the Common Front End to allow logical decision making by the micro code. As seen in FIG. 4A there are interfaces to the front plane double arrow and to the backplane single arrow which involve the Maintenance Card. These MC lines will be seen as lines 30, 34 and 40. MAINTENANCE CARD CONNECTION There is a Maintenance CardCommon Front End interface XC CSE which is used when theMaintenance Card MC requires connection to a data link processor in order to perform normal maintenance functions.The maintenance card tries to connect to a DLP by driving the appropriate local maintenance address line LOCnn .O and the signal ADRVtD O address valid low. This action causes the addressed OFE 10c to recognize the MC connection and to drive the logic term LOCAL .1 low. The LOCAL .1 term is used to enable a backplane receiver chip which allows the MC to take the DLP off line OFFLINE 1 signal coming from the MC goes low . If the MC takes a DLP off line, it is unavailable to the host system If the DL is off line it does not see any DC Distribution Control Card attempts at connection, and all DLP requests to the DC are inhibited. The Maintenance Card always takes the data link processor off line when maintenance routines are called for. Thins is done so that maintenance functions such as single pulse and PROM verification do not interfere with normal distribution control card operations to the on line data link processors. The logic term LOCAL .1, when low, is also used to enable the following functions 1. It allows SPRIF .O from the Maintenance Card to turn off eye data link processors peripheral interface.2. It becomes LOCALS which is used by the peripheral dependent board PDB for bus interface directional control logic.3. It is used to allow the Maintenance. Card MC local clear and PROM verification SW1 function.4. It is used by the Common Front End Card at for the development of the clock enable term CLKEN.DISTRIBUTION CARD CONNECTION The following discussion involves the connection mechanism as used by the DistributionControl Card Common Front End Card interface DClCFE when the Distribution Control Card requires connection to a data link processor. This connection will be initiated by aDistribution Control Card DC poll test or by a data link processor DLP initiated poll request. The connection logic is shown in FIG. 4D. The CONST lines 4 7 are fed as input to a 4 bit binary counter J3 C. The output of this counter is ied to a tri state inverter C4 C to provide, as output the status lines LCPSTL . The data link processor address LCPADn O and the off line signal OFFLN provide inputs to buffer chipM5 C whose output is fed through inverter P4 C to form theLCPAD signal to NAND gate M3 C. NAND gata M3 C also has signal inputs for parity error PERF and off line OFFLN .The output of NAND M3 C is the signal CONECTI which connects to the PDB bus directional control PROM and also provides inputs to inverters C4 C, C4 Cl, F4 C and also to the buffer F4 C. The CONECT also is formed as input to NAND B3 C having an output which is fed to NOR gate A4 C. The NOR gate A4 C is fed to inverter B4 C to form the logic control signal CLRD. The outputs of the inverter. C4 Cl form. the signal IOSND .O input output send and the signal LCPCON O data link processor connected . The buffer F4 C provides a distribution card strobe output and a distribution card terminate z s signal. The inverter E4 C provides a strobe level signal LCPSTL O data link processor strobe level . The Distribution Control Card DC will attempt to connect to a data link processor DLP by driving the appropriate DLP address line LCPADn O low. This backplane signal is applied to a buffer chip M5 C which is enabled when the data link processor DLP is on line. The output of the buffer chip is then fed through an inverter P4 Cj and applied to a 3 legged NAND gate M3 C to become the term CONECT . This CONECT term is used to enable the following set of signals on the DC CFE interface 1. LCPCON O. This line goes low when the DLP is connected.2. LCPSTUn O. These are the four data link processors status lines.3. IOSND .O. This is the state of the I O send flip flop.4. LCPS.TLlO. This is the data link processor strobe signal. 5. STIOL .O. This is the host system strobe signal. 6. TERM . .0. This is the host system terminate signal.7. SELCLR O. This is the Distribution Card DC to the data link processor DLP selective clear signal. 8. DATAoi O. This is the 17 bit data bus. All these backplane signals are low active and are enabled only when a the CFE is properly addressed by the Distribution Control Card DC and b a cannection is possible, that is, when the data link processor is on line, and there is no PROM parity error. The actual state of the enabled lines is dependent upon the logical condition of t he data link processor and the Distribution Control Card DC at the time of the connection.DATA LINK PROCESSOR REQUESTS A DLP request is the method by which a data link processor can notify the DistributionControl Card that it needs host system attention. A request can be considered to be.a DLP interrupt REQ tooth Distribution Card DC . A DLP request .isjnade to the Distribution Control Card when the DLP drives its jumpered request line LCPRQn O low, or when the DLP drives its jumpered request line andEMRREQ O emergency request low, Both types of these requests can be generated on the Common Front End Card CFE by the PROM stored micro code program. When the mirro code pro gram drives the PROM output line LDINT load interface low, the signals CONS1 for emergency request , and num CONST2 for request are loaded into a register called the request FIG. 4A latch 19 FIG. 4A at CLK8 time. Combinational type logic on the Common Front End allows emergency request to be enabled on the backplane anytime it occurs, if the data link processor is on line . If a DED issues an emergency request, it also issues a non emergency request. This is done so that the Distribution Control Card can determine which DLP is doing the emergency requesting. The backplane line EMRREQ O is csmmon to all data link processors in the base module, and the LCPRQn O lines are each unique. If a data link processor issues a non emergency request, it is enabled on tha backplane only if the data link processor is on line and no otherdata link processors in the base module are doing any energency reques ting,. DATA LINK PROCESSOR DATA TRANSFER RATE Two possible modes of operation govern the data transfer rate between the data link processor DLP and the main host system 10. IMese modes are called a demand mode and b burst mode. Demand mode causes data transfers to occur at a rate of less than four megahertz. Burst mode permits data word 16 bit transfers to occur at a four megahertz rate, that is, 64 megabits per second. The data link processor DLP and the Distribution Control Card DC Send strobe acknowledge signals back and forth to each, other when they present or accept data. The DLP sends the term LCPSTL O DLP strobe evel to the Distribution Control Card, and the Distribution Control Card sends STIOL .O to the data link processor. These strobing signals are exchanged during both the demand mode and the burst mode operations. The data transfer rate is determined by the speed at which these strobe signals are exchanged. FIG.4E show a data transfer timing diagram from .the DistributionControl Card DC to the data link processor. The Common Front End Card CFE receives a STIOL .O signal frown theDistribution Control Card and synchronizes it with the 8 megahertz clock by the use of a Schottky J K flip flop whose,outputs are named AF asynchronous flop and AF .The synchronized strobe level AF is used on the CommonFront End Card for PROM address bit AO micro code testing.The AF signal is available for use on the peripheral dependent board PDB by way of a foreplane connector pin.DEMAND NODE During buffer loading operations, theDistribution Card DC informs the data link processor that data is available by driving STIOL .O low. The data link processor micr6 code program informs the Distribution Beard that it has accepted the data that is on the DistributionCard interface line by driving the PROM logic term 9 LCPSTL low. num LCPSTL becomes LCPSTL O to the Distribution Card and causes the Distribution Card DC to drive the STIOL .O high until the next new word of data is available. During buffer read operations, the Distribution Card informs the data li.Ak processor that it is ready to accept new data by driving STIOL .O low. The data link processor micro code instructions inform the Distribution Card that new data is available on the Distribution Card interface line by driving the PROM logic term iLCPSTL low. LC STL becomes LCPSTL O to the Distribution Control Card. The Distribution Card informs the data liab processor that it has accepted the data by driving the STIOL .O high. The direction of the data flow is controlled by the PROM output term num CONST3. The term num CONST3 is clocked into the request latch 19 at PROM signal iLDINT Load system interface time and becomes IOSF I O send flop . The state of IOSF is sent to the Distribution Control Card as IOSND .O, and is used to inform the Distribution Control Card of the interface bus line direction. The state of IOSF is also sent to the peripheral dependent board PDB 80. The PDB 80 uses IOSF to assist in developing the interface bus line directional control logic. This logic determines which data link processor bus is active and what drivers or receivers must be used. BURST MODE While certain Data Link Processors can operate in either Demand Mode or in Burst Mode, the Train Printer Data Link Processor operates only in Demand Mode. CLEAR etTrCTIONS The CEE card 10C makes use of combinational type logic to implement its clearing functions. description of clearing functions applicable to all data link processors using the Common Front End Card follows Power Up Clear A power up clear signal is provided to the base module from either the power supply of the cabinet or from some external source as determined by the host system 10. This signal is attached via coaxial cable to a pin of the maintenance card backplane connector.The Maintenance Card uses this signal to create the master clear, MSTCLR 0. The signal MSTCLR O clears the data link processor if it is on line.Base Clear The base clear function is provided by a pushbutton switch located on the Maintenance Card foreplane connector. The switch is ORed with the power up clear and performs the same function as a power up clear.Maintenance Local Clear If the Maintenande Card is connected to a data link processor, the Maintenance Card can clear the data link processor by driving LCLCLR O low clear level from Maintenance Card .Host System Master Clear The host system 10 can issue a master clear signal across its message level interface 15i MLI . The Distribution Control Card DC contains a host system jumper option which, if installed, causes tile master clear MSTCLR O to go low . This signal clears all the data link processors that are not addressed by the Maintenance Card. If the Distribution Control Card host system option jloper is not installed then the host master clear signal is not passed through the DistributionControl Card to the backplane.Host System Selective Clear The host system 10 can clear a single data link processor during a standard poll test operation by driving the message level interface MLI line TRM MC l low. This action causes the Distribution Card to drive SE1CLR O low. The SELCLR O being low causes the connected data link processor to clear. FIG. 3 shows in schematic form the physical structure of the Commou Front End CFE card 10 while FIG. 4A shows the basic circuit block diagram of the Colon Front End Card. Included in the CFE is the clear circuitry shown in FIG. 4B. It will be seen that NOR gate 113 has inputs from NAND gates 110 and 111 in addition to an input from inverter 114 which is fed by buffer 112. The Output of gate 113 is fed to buffer 115 and also to inverter 116. inverter 116 feeds its signal to a Schottky data register chip 117 which provides an output to the PROM address multiplexor 12 of FIG. 4A. The output of data register 117 is also used to provide one of the inputs to NAND gate 118. A low signal which results on.the output of the NOR gate 113 occurs if any one of the following conditions is met 1. MSTCLR O and OFFLN are both low . 2. SELCLR O and ODNECTI are both low. 3. LCKCLR O and LOCAL are both low. The low output of NOR gate 113 is used to perform the following functions 1. The output is fed through a buffer chip 115 to become signal CLR . CLR clears the PROM parity error flip flop and flip flops SOTB, AF, and TERME on the CFE low 2. CLR is sent to the peripheral dependent board PDB 80 to clear the specific peripheral dependent logic. 3. The low output signal of NOR gate 113 is sent through an inverter 116 and is applied to one input of the data register chip 117. It is sent as the logic term CARD. The signal CLRD is double synchronized with CLOCK and becomes the signal SCLR synchronized clear . 4. The signal SCLR from register 117 is used o force the PROM clock disabling term CLXST clock stop low. This is done in the event that a PROM parity error may have caused CDCST to go high.5. The SCLR signal is used to disable the PROM address multiplexor chips 12. This forces the PROM address lines to all zeros. Address zero is the starting address of all data link processor micro code programs.CFE CLOCK CONTROL The clock control logic in the CFE 10e uses combinational type logic NAND gates, NOR gates, inverters, buffers, and a Schottky data register chip , in order to enable or disable the always present 8 megahertz backplane clock CLOCK.. .0 . The circuitry for the CFE clock control is shown in FIG. 4C. The CPE clock control logic constantly monitors the state of the maintenance bus 30 to determine how it should supply clock signals to the data link processor. In Table VII there tms shown the available clock control options and the maintenance bus line states that are necessary to cause the various options to be active. Table VIII showed the maintenance lines for driving the PROM address lines AO A9. In the CFE clock control circuitry shown in FIG, 4C, it will be seen that the NAYD. gate A3 has three inputs and the NAND gate 13 1 has four inputs. The first input toNAND gate A3 is from the data register C3 along the SCLR line. The second input to gate A3 is the line PERF .The PERF signal is the PROM parity flip flop signal. When high , it indicates that an error has been detested on thePROM output register 14, thus stopping the DLP clock. ThePERF signal is thescomplement of PERF. The thrd input .to . gate.A3.is fromrthe PROMCLK1 output of NOR H4 1 The first input to gate 13 1 is the SCLR line. The second input to gate 13 1 is the PERF line. The third input to gate 13 1 is from the CLKEN line and the fourth.input to gate 13 1 is the output of the buffer N5 1. The NAND gate M3 has one input from inverter P4 ADLOC and another input. coming from the inverter B4 1 BASLCL O . The input for the data register C3 comes from NOR gate A3 2 which has one input from inverter B4, one input coming from NOR gate A3 1, and one input coming from the line START .O. The NOR gate A3 1 has two inputs, one of which is the line BASLCL O and the other input is the lineLOCAL .1. The output of gate A3 is fed to the input of NOR gate The The output of NAND gate 13 1 is fed to the input ofNAND gate H4 13. The output of inverter H5 CLOCK.. .0 is fed to both the input of gate.H4 2 and gate H4 13. The output of gate A3 is fed to the input of NOR gate H4 1 to form the signal line PROMCLK . The output ofNAND gate H4 13 is fed to buffer 14 1 and to buffer G4.NORMAL ON LINE MODE. When certain of the following conditions are met, then all. data link processor clocks are active at the 8 megahertz rate. These conditions areT 1. BASLCL O is high the base module is not in local .2. LOCAL .1 is high the DLP is not Maintenance Card MC addresed . 3. PERF is high no PROM parity error . The signals BASLCL O and LOCAL .1, both being high , causes a high on to one input of the Schottky data register. 03. This register chip is clocked by the always present signal CLOCK .This signal is derived from the backplane clock signal CLOCK..,O after a triple inversion. One output of the register chip C3 becomes the logic term clock enable CLKEN . The signal clock enable is NANDed on two gates A3 4 and 13 1 using the signals PERFI, SW1 , and the output of NAND gate M3. Gate M3 has inputs which are a The signal ADLOC after inversion . The ADLOCI is low when the DLP is not addressed by the MC, or when ADRVLD O is high. b. The backplane signal BASLCL O after inversion . The output of NAND gate A3 4 becomes the signal logic term B P CLKEN and this is NANDed with the signal CLOCK .O after inversion by inverter H5 which is fed as one input to gate H4 2 . The output of gate H4 2 is fed. through a NOR gate H4 1 to form the signal PROMCLK . This signal PROMCLK is used to clock the PROM data registers 14 and the stack register 11 of FIG. 4A. The output..of..NAND gate l3 .l becomes the signal CLKEN . This signal CLKEN when low , enables the 8 megahertz backplane clocks on the peripheral dependent board PDB 80. The CLKEN signal is NANDed with the signal CLOCK..O after inversion at the gate H4 13. The output of gate H4 13 is fed through, one inverter buffer 14 1 and also through one non izaverting buffer G4 to become the signals respectively CLK8 and CLK8 8 megahertz clock. These clock signals are used in the Common Front End Card 10c STANDARD LOCAL MODE The standard local mode of maintenance is operative under the following conditions Also see Table VII . 1. BASLCL 0 is high base is noc in local . 2. ADRVLD O address valid is low and the LOCnn .O lines on the maintenance bus are valid.3. The LOCnn .O lines equal the local address jumpers on the CFE 10c This equal comparison together with theADRVLD O being low, forces LOCAL .1 into low. Loc AL .l low means that the DLP is Maintenance Card addressed . IN this mode all the maintenance fnctions are available for example, the Maintenance Card can now 1. select the single pulse mode.2. perform PROM micro code verification.3. set up known conditions by manipulating the PROM address during single pulse operations, and test for known predicted results by sampling the maintenance bus display DPLY and the data simulate DSIM lines.SINGLE PULSE MODE After the Maincenance Card has localized the data link processor DLP , it can place the DLP in a single pulse mode by driving the signalSP ....O into low . This action forces the logic term CLKEN into low because the NOR gate A3 2 ofFIG. 4C is disabled by the following logic 1. Signal SP ....O is inverted into high and disables the top input line of gate A3 2.2. The signal LOCAL .1 is low because the DLP is not Xaintenanced Card addressed. This action disables the middle input Line of gate A3 2 because of the high signal output of gate A3 1. The signal START .0 is high and disables the third input of gate A3 2. When gate A3 2 is disabled, a low signal is set into the data register C3 at CLOCK time. The output signal CLKEN when low, turns off NAND gatesA3 4 and 13 1, and causes their outputs to go high and to disable the NAND gates H4 2 and H4 13. When these two gates are disabled, the DLP clocks are turned off. Once the DLP is placed into a single pulse mode, theMaintenance Card can issue from 1 to 4,096 clocks by driving the START .O low. START .0 is a pulse which effectively is a window around a desired number of clocks that the Naintenanc Card wants issued. During the time frame when START .O is low, the high signal output of gate A3 2 is clocked into the data register C3 by the always present clock signal CLOCK. The CLKEN now becomes a pulse rather than a level, and the DLP clocks are enabled only during the low active time span of START .O. After the data link processor DLP has been placed into the single pulse mode, the Maintenance Card can take the DLP out of it by driving SP ....O high. The signal SP ....O, when high, forces a high level input into register C3 as follows FIG. 4C The signal SP ....O is inverted low by the inverter B4. This low,signaL is fed into NOR gate A3 2 and causes its output to go high. mis high level is clocked into data register C3 with CLOCK and becomes CLKEN. The signal CLKEN, when high, enables all the data link processor s clocks. PROM MICRO CODE VERIFICATION If the Maintenance Card has localized and placed the data link processor into the single pulse mode, it can read any Common Front End PROM micro code word by driving the signal SWR.l .O low. The signal SWH.1 .0 is routed through the buffer N5 1 FIC. 4C to become the logic term SW1 . This signal S W1 is sent to the peripheral dependent board PDB 80 and is used in the bus interface directional control logic in order to develop the logic term SIMRCV , SimulateReceive, FIG. 4A, line 33 . When SIMRCV is low, the maintenance bus lines LOdn DSIMnn O of FIG. 5B are gated into the inputs of PROM address multiplexor chips 12 ofFIG. 4A.The SWl also forces the PROM address multiplexors 12 to select the DSIMnn O data as the actual PROM address.This way the Maintenance Card controls the current PROM address. SW1 is also tied to one of the inputs of NAND gate 13 1, FIG. 4C, and is used to keep the clock signalsCLK81, CLK8, and the clock enable signal CIjKENI to the peripheral dependent board 80 turned off When the Maintenance Card issues a single pulse clock, the PROMCLK latches the addressed PROM data into the PROM registers 14 FIG. 4A because SWlI is not tied to the NAND gate,A3. The Maintenance Card now has the currentPROM word available for sampling.The Maintenance Card can now read the PROM data 8 bits at a time by driving the maintenance bus lines DSELn1.0. The DSELn .O lines 34, FIG. 4A, ,are used on the CFE 10c, to select which 8 data bits will be enabled onto the maintenance bus lines DLPYnn O, at 40 of FIG. 4A. Seven reads are required to sample one entire micro code address. LOCAL MODE WITH BASE IN LOCAL Under certain conditions the maintenance mode is operatively in effect these conditions are 1. BASLCL 0 is low the base is in local . 2. ADRVLD O is low that is, the LOCnn .0 lines on the maintenance bus are valid . 3. The LOChn .O lines equal the local address jumpers on the OFE 10C. . This equal comparison, along with ADRVLD O low, forces LOCAL .1 low also. LOCAL .1, when low, means that the data link processor DLP is being Maintenance Card addressed. This mode of operation causes the addressed data link processor to function in exactly the same manner as the standard local mode. All anaddressed DLPs disable their, own clocks. BASE NODULE IN LOCAL MODE AND DLP CLOCKS DISABtFD This is a mode of operation which takes place when the following conditions are satisfied 1. BASLCL 0 is low the base is in local . 2. ADRVLD O is low the LOOnn .O lines are valid .3. The LOCtin .O lines do not equal the CFE local address jumpers. This unequaled comparison along with ADRVLD O being low, forces LOCAL high and ADLOC low The LOCAL .1 when high, means that theDLP is not Maintenanced Card addressed. In this mode all the DLP clocks 2re disabled because the BASLCL O low level is inverted by the inverter B4 1 FIG. 4C , This level high is Wed by gate M3 with the inverted ADLOCI signal inverted by P4 . When both inputs to gates are high , the..output goes low and disables the NAND gate A3 4 and The The outputs of these gates both go high and disable the gate H4 1 and H4 13. When these two gates are disabled, all the DLP clocks are inhibited. BASE S INCLE 2ULSE The single pulse maintenance mode is in effect when the following conditions occur 1. BASLCL O is low the base is in local .2. ADRVLD O is high that is, the LOCnn .O lines on the maintenance bus are invalid In, this mode of operation the Maintenance Card can place the entire base in a, single pulse mode by driving the logic as follows 1. SP ....O low this action disables the top input of the NOR gate A3 2 2. BASCL O is low. This action puts the base in local and causes the output of NOR gate A3 1 to go high. This high level disables the middle input line of NOR gate A3 2. 3. ST.kRT .O high disables the bottom input of NOR gate A3 2. When NOR gate A3 2 FIG. 4C is disabled, its output goes.low This low output is latched into the data register C3 and becomes the logic term CLKEN. This clock enable line, when low, disables NAND gates A3 4 and 13 1. The outputs of these NAND gates go high and disable the gates H4 1 and H4 13. When the gates H4 1 and H4 13 are disabled, then all DLP clocks are iiibited. The base single pulse maintenance mode of operation will make all data link processors respond to single pulse because ADRVL D O is high and BASZ CL O is low. The signalADRVLD O when high, disables the tri state 8 2 1 multiplexor chip 12, FIG. 4A on the CFE that is used to generate the logic terms LOCAL .1 and ADLOC .When this multiplexor chip is disabled, both signals are pulledrup high with 1100 ohm resistors to 5 volts. ADLOC , when high, after inverson to low by the. inverter P4, FIG. 4C disables the NAND gate M3. Then high level output of gate M3 allows the single pulse clock to be enabled when the Maintenance Card drives the signal START low. Further description off the single pulse operation has ,been previously described in the standard local mode of operation. STACK REGISTER OPERATION The operation cr the stack register L1 FIG. 4A is controlled by the state or a PROM 13 output signal line num LDSTCK . The signal num LDSTCK is held low during non subroutine micro code instructions. This low level is applied to the low enable inputs of the 3 stack register chips 11. This action causes the stack register 11 to load and hold the current PROM micro code address. All micro code programs have the ability to enter one level of subroutine by driving and holding the signal num LDSTCK high. With num LDSTCKl going high the following actions will occur 1. The stack register load function is disabled. 2. The stack register count function is enabled. The signal num LDSTCK of FIG. 4A is also routed through a Schottky data register chip to become the, logic te STCLKEN . This signal is then inverted and used to count up the stack register plus one. This address is held in the register until the subroutine is completed. This updated address is used when the subroutine does a stack branch to return to the main body of the micro code instructions. The non subroutine code is then re entered and the signal num LDSTCK goes low. MAINTENANCE DISPLAY LINES OF COMMON FRONT END CFE The CFE 10 contains standard items such as inverting tri state buffers and eight c to one multiplexor chips that are used to enable the maintenance display lines 40 of FIG. 4A DPLYOI O DPLV10 0 .

With this display select code, the CFE also drives DSTAT8 0 DSTAT1 0, DLCPST 0, and DIOSMD 0 MC Group 24 . Signals are low true on backplane. The Co on Front End also has the ability to display signals on the lines DSTAT8 0 DSIMA.T1 Glossary Table I , which are the data link processor status lines top the Maintenance Card. The CFE also can display DLCPST C the data link processor strobe to the Maintenance Card and also the DIOSND O which is the SEND level of I O to the MaintenanceCard . All of these lines are used by the MaintenanceCard as 20cm to test and verify the operation of the CEE card.The DSEL8 0 lines multiplexor chip select line for input to the display lines DSELl 0 multiplexor address line ,. for data selection to display lines . are sent to the Common Front End card from the Maintenance Card and are used to select theCFE internal signals that are enabled on to the display lines after the data link processor has been addressed by the Maintenance Card. The Table IX shows a list of the displayable CFE signals and also the DSELn O line codes that are required to.enable them on to the maintenance display bus.PROM ADDRESS SElECTION Referring to Tables Xa andXb, the selection of micro code addresses is implemented on the Common Front End card 10c which uses circuitry that employs standard logic gates, multiplexor chips, register chips and a decoder chip. The multiplexors 12 drive PROM address lines AO A9 FIG. 4A . This causes the micro code data to be latched into the registers 14 with every 8 megahertz clock pulse.TABLE Xa CFE PROM Address Selection PROM Output PROM Input Branch Lines Address Lines num BRANCHn An See BR6 54321 9 4 3 1 0 Note O 00000 num NEXTn num NEXTn num NEXTO 1 O 00001 num NEXTn num NEXTn AF 2 O 00010 num NEXTn num NEXTn TERNF 2 O 00011 num NEXTn num NEXTn LCPADF 2 O 00100 num NEXTn num NEXTn STOPF 2 O 00101 num NEXTn num NEXTn TEST5 2 O 00110 num NEXTn num NEXTn TEST6 2 O 00111 num NEXTn OPDECn OPDEC1 3 O 01000 num NEXTn num NEXTn TEST8 2 0 01001 num NEXTn num NEXTn TEST9 2 O 01010 num NEXTn num NEXTn TEST10 2 O 01011 num NEXTn num NEXTn TEST11 2 O 01100 num NEXTn num NEXTn TEST12 2 O 01101 num NEXTn num NEXTn TEST12 2 O 01110 num NEXTn num NEXTn TEST14 2 0 01111 STCKAn STCKAn STCKAO 4 1 num NEXTn num NEXTn PDB MX 5 1 num NEXTn num NEXTn PDB MX 5 SW1 O Maintenance Data Bus 6 CLEAR O 0 0 7 NOTES 1 Unconditional branch. 2 2 way branch TEST5 TEST14 from PDB . 3 15 way branch OPDEC from PDB . 4 Stack branch 5 2 way branch AO is driven directly from the PDB . 6 Maintenance Card PROM read mode. 7 Clear forces zeros onto the PROM address lines 1 high 0 low don t care T.LE Xb Enable Lines For xDanded AO Selection PROM output Enable line to Peripheral branch lines Dependent board for ended num BRANCHn selection of AO BR6 5 4 O 0 O ., AO is driven by rruitiplexors on CFE card O 0 1 O 1 0 SEL2 0 1 1 SEL3 1 0 0 SEL4 1 0 1 SELS 1 1 0 SEL6 With reference to Table Xa showing the CFE signals, the primary multiplexor input select lines are the current latched PROM outputs of num BRANCH3, Table 2DC and the signal term BR6 Branch line from PDB 80 for PROM address selection . In order to accomplish Address Bit AO Selection at line 36, FIG. 4A num BRANCH1 num BRANCH3 will select the input lines to two separate multiplexor chips. num BRANCH4, num BRANCH5 and BR6 is peripheral type dependent and may be driven either by the PDE logic or by one of the latchedPROM outputs. If a PROM output line is used to drive BR6 Table Xb , it is sent over to the peripheral dependent board PDB 80 and then is returned as the BR6 line. There are 22 such lines, fG3 WL4, Table IX, which are available to the peripheral dependent board, PDB 80. These lines are primarily used for controlling the peripheral dependent logic on thePDB 80. The num BRANCHn bits and 3R6 are also used for the generation of PROM address lines.ACj A9. FIG. 4A This is accomplished by the use of the term BROP PROM address branch and BURST use stack register for PROM aadress . BROP is high whenever the num BRANCHn bits and the BR6 select a branch to one of 16 addresses 16 way branch , .BRST is High when the, fBRANCEn bits and BR6 select a branch that uses the stack register 11 as the address. If neither a 16 way or a stack register branch is selected, then either an unconditional or a two way branch is performed. PROM address selection can also be achieved by the use of the maintenance term SW1 , FIG. 4C . When the CFE 10c is under the control of theMaintenance Card and the MC drives SW1 low , theMC can address and read any micro code address. This feature is utilized to read and verify the contents of the PROM matrix and to test the integrity of its associated registers. The num BRANC bits and the BR6 are overri10dee0 whenever a master, selective, or local clear is issued to the OFE 10C. Any clear condition forces the PROM address bus AO A9, FIG. 4A to equal 0.The address bus AO A9 is defined in Glossary Table I.Address 0 is the starting point of all micro code programs. As will be seen in Table Xa, there is a listing of all the possible branching conditions that can be used for the generation of the next PROM address.Table Xb shows a list of five CFE generated enable lines that can be used for an expanded selection ofPROM address bit AO. These enable lines are activated when the PDB 80 requires additional two way branching capabilities. PROM PARITY CHECKING The CFE card 10 performs anPROM odd parity check on every 49 bit PROM micro code word. The total word length is actually 52 bits but the three most significant bits are not used by the micro code program. These three bits are not parity checked. The currently addressed micro code word is latched into the register chips 14. and from these register chips is fed into cascaded parity checking chips 18 of FIG. 4A. Thus, this circuitry allows the CFE 10 to exa tne the entire 49 bit word at one tile. If the sum total of the word equals even parity, then the logic ten PER parity error goes high. PER going high causes the rarity error flip flop of 18 to be set on the next 8 magahertz clock pulse. The setting of the parity error flip flop causes the logic term PERF to go low . PROM PARITY ERROR If even PROM parity is detected by the CFE card, the logic te PER goes high and causes the PROM parity error flip flop to set. At the same time that PER goes high, then PER goes low. PER going low causes the logic term CLKST clock stop to go high. CLKST going high disables th clock that controls the latching of the PROM register chips PROMCLK . The disabling of PROMCLK causes the data that caused the parity error to remain in the registers 14. The disabling of PROMCLK also locks the stack register 11 to its current value. If the parity error flip flop gets Set, then the logic term PERF goes low on line 41 of FIG 4A The PERF going low causes the following actions to occur. 1. PERF is routed to the periferal dependent board PDB 80 to turn off the peripheral device.2. The request latch 19 on the CFE card is cleared. This action causes the I O SEND flip flop,REQ request , and EMRREQ emergency request signals frcm Drivers 20 to turn off . 3. The logic term CONECT is forced high. This action prevents t .y distribution card DC connection and severs any DC connection that may have been in progress at the time of the error.4. The peripheral dependent board 8 megahertz clock is turned off. PE RF going low forces the logic term CLKEN high. CLKEN is used by the PDB 80 to permit 8 megahertz clocks.5. The CFE 8 megahertz clocks CLK8 and CLKS are turned off. If a PROM parity error disables locks up a data link processor, the error conditIon can be removed through the use of a base power up clear, a Maintenance Card base clear a Distributicn CardMaster Clear or a Maintenance Card initiated DL local clear. TRAIN PRINTER DATA LINK PROCESSOR Description The Data Link Processor used in Burroughs I O 5ubsysrems, whereby the Data Link Processors act as peripheral controller interfaces between specified peripheral terminal units and a main host computer, have been designed so as to be assembled from two slide in printed circuit cards. One of these cards is the CFE or Co on Front End Card which provides the common standardized functions of all, types of data link processors, and the second card is the PDE, or peripheral dependent board, which supplies the particular functions required for a given type of peripheral terminal unit, in this case, the terminal unit being a Train Printer.Such Train Printers, which may also be called a train type printer mechanism, cone with generally 132 print positions and have unique 2 8, 48, 72 or 96t character sets. These line printers provide high quality, high speed alphanumeric output at operating speeds of 675 LPM lines per minute , or up to 1100 LPM, or even up to 1800 LPM with ,an 18 character set. For example, a basic Train Printer is capable of printing at a rate of 1100 LPM when printing with a 48 character set and with single line spacing Train Printers of the, above mentioned categories are described in printed publications of the Burroughs Corporation, Detroit, Michigan 48232, such as Form num 1094802 Copyright 1976, or Form i1066328 Copyright 1972, 1973, 1974. The Peripheral Dependent Board of the Train Printer Data Link Processor TP PD3 contains the necessary logic circuitry which typically interface 1100 and 1500 lines per minute Train Printers into the Burroughs I O subsystems which use data link Processors DLP . The PD3 80 is controlled by the micro code Cards contained in the Common Front End Card and its PROMs. As previously mentioned, the CFE and TP PDB, in combination with the proper micro code, make up the Train Printer Data Link Processor TP DLP . The Train Printer Data Link Processor accepts print information from a main host system, stores this information in a buffer, and sends hammer actuating signals to the TrainPrinter as each character in the buffer is matched by a ,train character coming into the proper position over a paper sheet to be printed. The Train Printer Data Link Processor contains the following elements and features a a print buffer which holds one full line of print. b a soft loaded universal train image buffer storage. c print position compatibility recognition unit for 80, 120 or 132 characters. d variable definition of graphic character sets. e train and train image ID verification, when required. f line delimiter capability. The train or print train is a rotating unit of blocks each individually connected to the next one like a string of box cars in a railroad system, and where each of the boxes or units carries a single character or several characters of the character sets to be used in printing on them paper which runs juxtaposed to the line of box cars of character sets. Graphics on the train or string of box cars are numbered sequentially beginning with the number 0 for the first character of each set on the train. Overprinting is permitted via the software. I O Description for the Train Printer DLP The TP DLP I O descriptors contain 1 digit of OP code and three digits of variant which describe the type of operation. This descriptor is received by the Train PrinterData Link Processor in one transmission from the host system. There are three valid types of OP codes for the TrainPrinter Data Link Processor. These are codes for WRITE This is any operation where data is transferred from the host system to the Train Printer DLP buffer storage. TEST This is any operation where no data transfer takes place between the Train Printer DLP and the host system, but operates by sending a result descriptor to the host system. ECHO This is an operation that results in receiving a message bl6ck from the host system and then the transmission of the same information back to the host system. It will be noted that there is no Read operation used in this system. At no time is a Read operation accepted as valid by the Train Printer DLP. Thus the Read operation bit, A8, must allays be O , If a Read operation should be received by the Train Printter DLP, a descriptor error is flagged and a result descriptor is returned to the host system. The I O descriptors, sometimes called Command Words, are obtained in the form of variants which accompany the OP codes. The various permissible operations used are shown in the following Table 11.

TIB refers to Train Image Buffer which is a portion of RAM buffer 22 shown in FIGS. 4A, 5A, SB, 5C.DESCRIPTION In reference to Table II WRITE The Write operation prints and also moves paper, or else moves paper and also prints, according to the format information received in the first word of the data stream for each line to be printed. It continues printing lines until a termination condition is reached.If an invalid bit pattern is detected on a print buffer FIGS. 5B,5C load operation, the operation is terminated after printing the line, and a result descriptor R D is returned to the host computer with the print check invalid found bit set and also the print error lineprinted bit set. WRITE HALT The write halt operation performs the same actions as the Write operation except that if an invalid bit pattern is detected, the loading of the print buffer FIG. 5B is completed, but that line is not printed.WRITE LINE The write line operation prints one line with the paper motion as defined in the OP code.If an invalid bit pattern is detected, the line is printed and a result descriptor R D indicating the error condition is returned to the host system. The paper motion format code is shown in the following Table 12 TABLE 12 Train Printer DLP Paper Motion Format Codes Code Description Printer Format TapeO 0 0 O No paper motion 2 and 12 channel tape O 0 0 1 Advance to heading 2 and 12 channel tape O 0 1 0 Advance to ch.2 2 and 12 channel tape O 0 1 1 Advance to ch.3 2 and 12 channel tape O 1 0 0 Advance to ch.4 2 and 12 channel tape O 1 0 1 Advance to ch.5 2 and 12 channel tape O 1 1 0 Advance to ch.6 2 and 12 channel tape O 1 1 1 Advance to ch.7 2 and 12 channel tape 1 0 0 1 Advance to ch.8 2 and 12 channel tape 1 0 0 1 Advance to ch.9 2 and 12 channel tape 1 0 1 0 Advance to ch.lO 2.and 12 channel tape 1 0 1 1 Advance to ch.11 2 and 12 channel tape 1 1 0 0 Advance to end of page 2 and 12 channel tape 1 1 0 1 Advance to EOP or next ch. 2 channel tape only 1 1 1 0 Single space 2 and 12 channel tape 1 1 1 1 Double space 2 and 12 channel tape NOTES 1. With the exception of write and write halt, the above format information must appear in variant digit V3 as defined by NNNN in table 11. 2. For write and write halt operations, the format information must appear in the first word transmitted with each line of print. The composition of the format word is as follows Digit A B C D Code SR R R N N N N R R R R R R R R Where S The bit which, when true, causes paper motion to occur prior to printing the line. N The bits which define format as in table 12. R The bits which are reserved and must be zero. WRITE LINE HALT The write line halt operation performs the same actions as the wrire line except that if an invalid bit pattern is detected, the print buffer loading is completed, but that line is not printed.MOVE WRITE LINE The move write line operation performs the same operation as the write line operation except that paper motion occurs prior to the printing of the line. MOVE iRITE L HALT The move write line halt operation performs the same action as the write line halt operation except paper motion occurs prior to the printing of the line.WRITE LOAD TIB TRAIN IMAGE BUFFER The write load TIB operation serves to load the train image buffer FIG. 5B which is described later. The variant digits Table 11,V2 and V3 define the train identification ID . 3its 8 and 4 of V2 are encoded to define the printer s speed 00 750 LPM 01 z 1100 LPM 10 1500 1PM 11 is reserved .TEST The test operation returns a test result descriptor R D to the main host system. These test result descriptors will be discussed further hereinafter.TEST WAIT READ The test wait ready OP code causes the DLP to be placed in an enable state. It remains enabled until the Train Printer FIG. 2 is made ready by the operator or. until the test wait operation is cancelled. If the DLP is in a ready state on receipt of this operation, the DLP branches and writes an operation complete result descriptor If the operator makes the. .Train Printer peripheral ready when the DLP is in a test wait ready state, the DLP will report operation completen in its result descriptor R D . If the DLP receives a conditional cancel OP code the test OP code is cancelled and the conditional cancel complete bit is set in the result descriptor. If the Test Wait operation is in progress and an operation is received which is not a valid conditional cancel . the test operation is cancelled and both the descriptor error and the conditional cancel completed bits are set in the result descriptor. TST WAIT NoT READy The test wait not ready operation performs similarly to the test wait ready operation except that the DLP waits for a not ready condition and then reports a not ready result descriptor.TEST SKIP The test skip operation is used to perform paper motion without doing any printing. The paper motion control is encoded in variant w3, as described in Table 12.TEST CONDITIONAL CANCEL This test conditional cancel operation is used to cancel a test wait ready,opera tion or a test wait not ready operation. If a valid conditional cancel OP code is received while a test wait operation is in progress, the test operation is terminated and the conditional cancel completed bit is set in the result descriptor. If a test wait operation is in progress and an operation is received which is not a valid conditional cancel , the test operation is cancelled and both the descriptor error and the conditional cancel completed bit are set in a result descriptor. TEST ID This operation results in the da a link processor DLP , sending a 2 word result descriptor to the min Bost system. The first word is described below in discussion under the title of Train Printer DLP Result Descriptors . The second word of the result descriptor is the ID word which establishes a unique identification for that DLP to the main hos z system. This second word of the result descriptor is composed of 4 digits the first two digits contning the identifier for a Train Printer DLP and the next two digits which are field jumpered to identify the different TP DLPs in a given subsystem. This ID word should be differentiated from the Train ID which is a 6 bit number for the train block of characters which is presently installed on theTRAIN Printer mechanism 50p.The ID or second word of the result descriptor is formatted as follows EMI108.1 Second Word ID of Result Descriptor The variants A and B, above, are preset to always emit a HEX 02, thus specifying to the main host system that the peripheral involved is a Train Printer . The variants C and D specify, to the main host system, additional identification which provides the host system software with a method of differentiating between the multiple TP DLPs within a data link processor subsystem. The digits C and D are fieldjumperable in order to allow flexibility of identification. ECHO The echo operation causes the data link processor DLP to accept a full buffer of data from the main host system and return the data back again to the main host system. This is to permit a confidence check of the data paths. TMDT PRINTER DLP RESULT DESCRIPTORS The Train Printer DLP has the capability of returning different result descriptors, depending upon the current operation, The A digit is the same for all result descriptors. The following Table 13 is a description of the information conveyed by the bits in this A digit. TA3LE 13 A8 Not ready. The train printer is in a condition other than power on and ready to print. A4 Descriptor error. A parity error was detected on the I O descriptor or descriptor link. The OP code was not valid at this time conditional cancel , or an invalid OP code was received.

D1 ERROR RECOVERY The Train Printer data link processor indicates error condition information in the result descriptor.The errors are logged in the host system maintenance log. The actual recovery techniques are the responsibility of the host system software.MESSAGE GEN TION AND PARITY CECEING The I O descriptor, the descriptor links D L and the result descriptors R D are transmitted FIG. 1 between the Train Printer data link processor 203 nd the main host system 10 through the MessageLevel Interface 15i ,YLI via the Distribution Card 20od The Message Level Interface 15i is a 25 wire cable used to connect the data link processor s Base Module 200 with the main host system 10 as seen in FIG. 2. Parity errors or invaiid OP codes which are detected on descriptor transfers will cause the Train Printer DLP to send a result descriptor to the host system and suppress the data transfer. A parity error de tected on a data transfer during print operation causes the Train Printer DLP to complete the buffer loading and to send a result descriptor to host 10 without printing the line. A parity error detected on data transfer during the load train image buffer operation causes the Train Printer DLP to complete the operation and to send the result descriptor to the host 10 indicating that the train image buffer is not loaded. Parity is stored in both the train image and the print image buffers FIGS. 53, 5C and, during print operations, is checked when the Train Printer DLP is in a print cycle on to the printer mechanism. If an error is detected, the printing is terminated and a result descriptor indicating the error is returned to the main host system 10.TRAIN PR CtTER DLP CHARACTERISTICS The following discussion will describe the major characteristics of the Train Printer Data Link Processor, especially the Train Image Buffer, the Print Image Bluffer, the Delimiter Character, Format Control and Train Identification in addition to other factors of significance.TRAIN AGE BUFFER In reference to RAM 22 of FIG. 5A andFIGS. DB, 5C, the Train Printer DLP contains an element designated as a train image buffer TIB . The contents of this buffer are used to determine when to fire the print hammers of the printer mechanism 50p. For valid printing to occur, this buffer must be loaded with a character set that matches the currently used print train blocks in the printer mechanism. The train image buffer TIB has 288 addressable bytes correspunding to the 288 characters on the train module. Each byte is an 8 bit entry corresponding to a particular character on the train module.The TrainPrinter Data Link Processor receives two 8 bit bytes on each memory access as the train image buffer FIG. 5B is being loaded. A new train image must be loaded from the host system into this buffer whenever train modules are interchanged or whenever the TP DLP has been either master cleared or taken off line for maintenance operation. The first word of data transmitted to the TrainPrinter DLP on the load TIB operation must contain a host system definition for the blank and the invalid code bit pattern two extra characters are supplied for a load TIB operation and are stored separately from the TIB . These special characters are described later. The blank code bit pattern is designed to appear in the A and B digits of this first word and the invalid code bit pattern appears in the C and D digits. The definition of variable graphic character sets on the same train module is permitted. Also partial sets, or more frequently used characters can be created in order to maximize print speed. Most printer trains contain multiple copies of each graphic item. For example, oti a 48graphic train, the graphic A occurs in positions 18, 66, 114, and 162. If the EBCDIC character A , coded as XEX C1 is to be printed as a graphic A, then HEX C1 must be loaded into the train image buffer at location 17, 65, 113, and 161. The first location in the train image buffer is designated as O . If there were other EBCDIC values, in addition to A , to be printed as the graphic A , then the 4 train image buffer locations would be distributed among the alternative values. For example, if the lower case EBCDIC character a ,HEX 81, is to be printed upper case as well, the train image buffer is loaded as follows TIB 17 C1 TIB 65 81 TIB 113 C1 and TIB 161 81. During a train image load , if a delimiter character HEX CF, described hereinafter is detected, the operation completes by returning a result descriptor indicating the traIn image buffer is not loaded . PRINT BUFFER The Train Printer data link processor contains a print buffer which is loaded once per print operation with data entries consisting of two 8 bit characters plus parity per word. FIGS. 5B and 5C show the allocations in RAM 22 which are dedicated for the print image buffer, PIB. The buffer capacity is sufficient for one line of print 132 characters maximum . The number of printer columns determines when the buffer is full. The result descriptor is returned just prior to paper motion. The Train Printer DLP is capable of accepting a new descriptor and or loading the buffer while paper motion is occurring in response to the previous descriptor or line of print.DELIMITER CHARACTER The delimiter character, HEX CF, is.recognized when it occurs in a data train and the data transmission is discontinued and the printing of the remaining columns is inhibited. The delimiter character is not printable and the 8 bit KEX CF code cannot be used to represent a graphic at any time.The check for a delimiter character can be inhibited by setting bit C8 of the variant digit V2 off the print OP code.If a delimiter character is received from the host system during a print image buffer load with bit C8 for the variant digit V2 set inhibit delimiter character check , this character is then flagged as invalid. FORMAT CONTROL The skipping and spacing of paper is determined by descriptor variant digit V3 on single line print operations or by information received in the first 16 bit transmission of data for each line of print on multiple line print operation. The note 2 on Table 12 gives a pictorial description of this format word. This word contains 11 reserved bits R which must always be O . On multiple line print operations, the TP DLP examines these 11 bits as it is loading the format word. If it detects anything other than a O in anyone of these 11 positions, the operation is terminated and a result descriptor is returned indicating a format error. When accepting a line during a multiple line print operation, the Train Printer DLP must receive at least one data character to be printed. If the host system terminates or transmits a delimiter immediately following the format word, the format error bit is set in the result descriptor and the operation is terminated. The alignment of the paper in the train printer is determined by the use of printer format tapes which are inserted in the Train Printer mechanism 5Op. TRAIN IDEN ICATION A sequence of 6 bits is received from each train module as an identifier. This information is reported on the result descriptor returned in response to all tests and echo operations, except the Test skip operation. Trains with no identifier are interpreted as having an identifier of O . The train ID bits of the load train image buffer LTIB descriptor must also be all O s or else printing is inhibited. Whenever the printer changes from a not ready to a ready state, compatibility between the train identifier ID and the train image buffer TIB is rechecked. Compatibility is also checked whenever the Train Printer DLP has been off line or master cleared. If the two were unequal, the Train PrinterData Link Processor sets the incorrect train on printer bit in the result descriptor for all subsequent operations until the correct train image is loaded or the correct train is installed on the printer.SPEED CAPABILA The Train Printer Data Link Processor has 1100 LPM and 1500 LPM lines per minute3 capability provided that the proper hard wired jumper 82 is installed. The operation w of the Train Printer DLP is not changed except that a in response to a test operation, the result descriptor bits are set to indicate the jumpered speed. b the Train Printer DLP is designed to expect the variant digit V2 bit position C4 of the load train imagebuffer descriptor LTB to indicate the printer speed that is, 1100 or 1500 lines per minute . If this bit does not compare with the installed speed jumper, the operation is terminated and the bit B4 incorrect train of the result descriptor is set. 3LA NE CE24CTER On a train image buffer TIB load , theTrain Printer DLP is designed to receive the host system defined bit configuration for the blank code. The characteristics for this blank character are as follows a if loaded into the print buffer on a print operation, the hammer associated with that column position on the paper, is not fired. b if loaded into the train image buffer, the graphic character associated with that position on the print train will never be printed. The blank character must be transmitted to the TrainPrinter DLP in the A and B digits of the first word of the load TIB data transmission.INVALID CHARACTER The Train Printer DLP, on a load TIB operation is designed to receive the host system defined bit configuration for the invalid code. This configuration must be either the host system defined blank code bit pattern or any one of the validly defined characters in the train image bluffer to3 . If it is any other configuration and it becomes necessary on a Write operation to substitute and print the invalid character because of an invalid bit pattern in the print buffer, the Train Printer DLP attempts to print this character. However, since it never finds a compare equal as defined under the print cycle, hereinafter described the Train Printer DLP terminates the operation by returning the result descriptor indicating a hung no match found . The invalid character will be transmitted to theTrain Printer Data Link Processor in the C and D digits of the first word of the TIB load data transmission. PAPER WIDTH DETERMINATION A jumper option is provided in, the Train Printer DLP for paper widths of 80, 120, 132 columns. The jumper must be correctly installed for the current printer which is in use. PRINT CYCLE The actual printing of characters is controlled by scanning a message to be printed and comparing it with the train image buffer of FIG. 5C. The character in the print buffer corresponds to the hammer position in the printer.The address of the train image buffer TIB corresponds to the character positioned over the hammer. If the 8 bit entry in the train image buffer is equal to the 8 bit code in the print buffer, a set level is sent to the printer and that hammer is fired on the next print cycle of the printer. A pointer into the train image buffer TIB is kept synchronized with the train movement. During print scans, the print message is scarsned and the address of the train image buffer is changed to correspond with the character hammer positions. This is continued until all the characters in the print buffer have been printed. TRAIN PRINTER DLP The elements of the hardware of theTrain Printer DLP are shown in FIGS. 4A and SA. The Train Printer Data Link Processor consists of two 96 chip, multi layered printed circuit cards, which plug into adjacent slots in the DLP Base Module backplane.These two printed circuit boards are designated as theCommon Front End CFE card and the peripheral dependent board PDB . These two boards are connected together by the use of three 50 pin foreplane connectors. Table IV, previously shown, lists the connectors by number and shows the signal name associated with each pin. As seen in FIGS. 4A and DA, the elements of the CFE are shown in block form. The central heart of the CFE is the PROM controller and storage sections 13 and 14. The PROM storage consists of 13 separate PROM chips giving a total storage capacity of 1,024 52 bit words, and this includes odd parity. The OFE low contains the receivers 110 for the DLP interfaces with the Distribution and the Maintenance Cards. The enable signals for these buses are driven by the PDB 80.The DLP RAM storage buffer 22, which has a capacity of 1024 17 bit words including odd parity , is also located in the CFE 10C. However, the RAM storage 22 is controlled entirely by the PDS 80. The Table I A contains a glossary of applicable CFE terms. PROM CONTP.OTLFR The 13 PROM chips designated element 13 FIGS. 4A, 5A on the CFE card are combined to make up a 52 bit micro code instruction word. The address lines to the 13 PROM chips are bused together so that all individual address lines are common to eyery chip. The data outputs of the 13 chip PROM matrix forms the 52 bit word. This word is read out of the address that is present on the common input address lines. Since these PROMs are unclocked devices, a means is required to synchronize the outputs with the 8 megahertz clock. This is accomplished by the use of register chips 14. The register chips contain 8 flip flops each, and thus 7 chips are used to synchronize and latch the 52 bit micro code word. This latched micro code instruction is used to control the operation of the entire data link processor. Every 8 megahertz clock pulse latches the next subsequent word into the register chip 14. Different types of data link processors require their own unique micro code thus all CEE cards contain the identical hardware except for the 13 PROM chips. Although the PROM word physically contains 52 bits only 49 bits are used by the micro code program. Tables VIa, VIb shows the 49 bit 0 48 micro code word, by bit position and name. It will be seen that allPROM output signal names are preceded by a pound sign num so that they are easily recognizable in the drawings and tables and in hardk are flows. Bit 32 of the micro code word is the parity bit odd . The CFE card continually checks for odd parity and halts the micro code program iS a parity error even parity occurs on any 49 bit PROM micro code word. RA.M BUFFER The Common Front End CFE 10 of FIG. 5A contains c the Random Access Memory buffer, RAM 22. The RAM buffer sometimes called the Data RAM consists of 1024 17 bit words.All inputs and outputs of this RAM memory are received or driven by the PDB 80. The designation used for this open collector 60 nanosecond read access RAM is RWON . This storage area is used to store the data, the OP code, the descriptor links, the descriptor links longitudinal parity word LPW and various flags that are required to properly control the operation of the Train Printer DLP.STACK REGISTER The stack register 11 consists of 3 binary counter chips. This register can contain the value of the current PROM address or the value of the address to be used when returning from a subroutine by way of a stack branch operation.PERIPHERAL DEPENDENT BOERD PDB The peripheral dependent board contains a general purpose register 230, of six 4 x 4 register files 212 used for accumulators, a column done RAM 214, an invalid character circuit 216, a LPW longitudinal parity word generator 218, a peripheral interface 220, line control logic 222, a data path multiplexor 224 using nine dual 4 1 data selector chips , compare logic 226, data bus drivers 28,plus error detection logic and 2 way branching logic. The Table I B contains a glossary of the PDB terms.A simplified description of the micro code treatment of a load train image buffer command will be found described hereinafter. The Train Printer Data Link Processor TP DLP is typically used to interface 1100 and 1500 lines per minute train printers to a host system via the Message Level Interface 15i MLI .As mentioned before, the TP DLP consists of two cards which constitute a Common Front End card CFE and PeripheralDependent Card which is commonly called a PeripheralDependent Board PDD . As previously discussed the Common Front End Card provides 1024 52 bit words of PROM that is used to store micro code, and 1024 17 bit words of UM for data storage, maintenance logic, and part of the DLP interface. The PDB 80 provides 1. the controlling signals to the Train Printer, 5Op. 2. address logic for the RAM buffer or the CFE and the RAM access logic.3. longitudinal parity word LPW and the vertical parity generation and checking logic.4. identification jumpers.5. twelve 8 bit accumulators. 6. a general purpose register.7. compare logic.8. other necessary flags and control logic. FIG. SA shows the basic block diagram of the TrainPrinter DLP. ACCUMULATOR The accumulators 212 of FIG. SA provide data storage for twelve 8 bit registers designated accumulators 0 11 . The accumulators are made up of six 4 x 4register file chips. Only two of these chips are selected at any one time. There are 8 input information lines and 8 output information lines associated with these accumulators.The addressing of the chips is indicated by Table 18 hereinbelow TABLE 18 Accumulator Addressing and Usage Chips SelectedAccumulator MSD LSD ACC8 ACC4 ACC2 ACC1 O K2 I3 0 0 0 0 1 K2 13 0 0 0 1 2 K2 I3 0 0 1 0 3 K2 I3 0 0 1 1 4 I2 K3 0 1 0 0 5 I2 K3 0 1 0 1 6 I2 K3 0 1 1 0 7 12 K3 0 1 1 1 8 J2 J3 1 0 0 0 9 J2 J3 1 0 0 1 10 J2 J3 1 0 1 0 11 J2 J3 1 0 1 1Accumulator Usage O Train absolute address 1 TIB subscan address 2 TIB subscan address restore 3 Print buffer subscan address 4 Print flags 5 CSL count 6 Result descriptor A and D digits 7 Result descriptor B and C digits 8 Initiate LPW flag, columns printed 9 Prescan blank address 10 Initiate flags, print data flags 11 Various addresses working register Accumulator 4 Bit Description O Column bottom top 0 top . 1 1 PCSL 3 or 4. 2 0 PCSL counted from 4 back to 1. 3 Train absolute bottom top 0 top . 4 1 Absolute train address overflow. 5 Not used. 6 Not used. 7 Train subscan bottom top 0 top .

Tells the write procedure to move paper first for a single line print. 5 Multiple line flag. Tells the write procedure that this is a multiple line print. 5 Terminate flag. Tells the write procedure to stop a multiple line print. 7 Back up flag. Tells the write procedure to perform an MLI back up of one character. The register chip select is derived from signals ACC 8 and ACC 4 by means of decoder chips not shown . A chip LO not shown provides write enable to the chips selected by the ACC 8 and ACC 4. Another chip SO not shown provides the read enable to the chips selected by theACC 8 and ACC 4. Locations within the 4 x 4 register file chips are addressed by signals ACC 1 and ACC 2 as seen in Table 18. The input to the accumulators 212 is either the num CONST lines or the sum of the iCONST lines and the UMAD lines BC register , depending upon the state of the MPXSELAD control signal.GENERAL PURPOSE REGISTER The general purpose register 230 provides the only sink for the accumulators 212. The general purpose register has 8 input information lines and 16 output information lines, and the register is divided into four 4 bit portions, A, B, C and D. These 4 bit portions are grouped into two 8 bit portions AD and BC. Information is loaded from the accumulators 212 into register portions AD or BC, or both depending upon the signals LDREGCAD load register column address , LDREGRAD load register RAM address , or both respectively. The 8 bit BC register drives the address line for theRAM buffer on the CFE card 10C. The 8 bit AD register addresses the column ,Col nnn Done RAM chip 214. The 16 bits from the register A, B, C and D digits provide one of the four sources for the data multiplexor 224. C0LL . DONE LOGIC The purpose of this logic 214 is to determine if a column has been printed and hence is given the mnemonic COLDONE. This output signal, when high, indicates that the column has already been printed or is not intended to be printed for example a blank is to be left in a column . Referring to the block diagram of FIG. 4D DLP connection logic and the schematic in FIG. 5G which is a general purpose register The column done logic consists of one 1K RAM chip L4. The address inputs to this chip L4 are controlled by the AD registers of register 230 and the signal plRaMCLD top half RAM column done , which is a high active micro code output. The signal IHRAMCLED designates upper lower column select 1 upper . The signal WECOLDN write enable column done is a low active signal generated by the micro code which supplies write enable to the chip. The signal DIRAMCOL data input to column done RAM is a high active signal generated by the micro code that supplies the input information to the RAM 22. RAM CONTROL The Random Access Memory 3uffer 22 RAM , as seen in FIGS. 5A, 5B and 5C, has a storage capacity of z x 17 bits 16 data bits with one odd parity bit and is located on the CFE card 10 . All the input, output, address, write c enable, a chip select lines are located on the peripheral dependent board 80. The above mentioned signals are connected to the PDB 80 through the top two foreplane connectors 80a and 80b The RluMADn lines 53 are always driven by contents of he BC register in register 230. The signal WE write enable is generated by a micro code output which is gated vith a clock 8 CLOCK 1 for the proper timing.The signal CS chip select is grounded on the PDB 80 thus continuously enabling the RAM 22. When the signal WE is high , the RAM 22 is placed in the Read mode. The information at the location addressed by the RLRDn lines 53 RAM address is placed on the RAMxn RAM output lines 22a and is routed to the data multiplexor 83m and thence to the 2 1 multiplexor of the data comparison logic 226. When the signal WE is low , the RAM 22 is placed in the Write mode. The lines DBUSxn are connected directly co the INRAMxn lines 100 on the peripheral dependent board 80.The information contained on the DBUSxn lines are written into the RAM 22 at the location addressed by the RAMADn lines 53. The RAM buffer 22 is used to store the train image and also the print image, the OP codes, the descriptor links, the longitudinal parity word LPW and other information.This is shown in FIGS. 5B, 5C which show the mapping of the RAM buffer 22. FIG. 5B shows the entire RAM mapped according to wordsO through 1023. The upper half of the RAM is not used words 512 1023 thus RAMAD 9 address bit 512 is grounded on the PDB 80. The 512 locations of RAM buffer 22 that are used are referred to as the lower RAM RAMAD 8 0 and the upper RA RLMAD 8 1 which is shown in FIGS 5B and 3C. FIG. 53 illustrates a map of the RAM buffer 22 where it can be seen that addresses 512 through 1023 are not used.The remainder of the buffer space is then divided into the bottom half of the RAM RAMAD 8 0 uhich include addresses 0 255, and this space is used for the descriptors and control words addresses 0 16 while addresses 190 255 are used for the print image buffer. The top half of the RAM 22 RAMAD 8 1 involves addresses 256 511, where addresses 256 367 are dedicated for control words, and addresses 368 511 are provided for the train image buffer. The following Table 19 shows the layout of the lower and upper RAM buffer 22.

The DI data input connection to the 1K RAM 216 isDIRAMINV data in the RAM is invalid which signal is micro code generated. The WE connection to the invalid RAM 216 is WERMINV write enable to invalid RAM which is also micro code generated. The invalid character detection is performed entirely by the micro code. DATA PATH MULTIPLEXOR.. As seen in FIG. 5A the data multiplexor 224 is used to select which of four possible sources is to drive the DBUS and the ISLAM bus 100. The data multiplexor 224 is made of nine dual 4 1 data selector chips which provide an output of 18 bits of which only 17 bits are used.The nine data selector chips are always enabled by the grounding of the strobe inputs ST1 and ST2 . The SLA inputs to the nine data selector chips are common and are driven by a micro code term MPXDATAA multiplexor data A .The SLB inputs are also common and are driven by the micro code term MPXDATAB multiplexor data B . The data selector chips of data multiplexor 224 are fed by four sources which are 1. 16 bits from the general purpose register 230 IpAAAD 7 2AMAD ,0 and also RAMAD 7 RAMAD O which are tied to the A l and A 2 inputs of the data selector chips.2. 16 bits which make up the second word of the test ID result descriptor ID word . This comes from the ID jumpers 82 and the hard wired circuitry 82 w As previously mentioned in the test ID description heretofore, the 8 most significant bits are fixed. Bit B2, which is connected to the 32 input of chip D3, is pulled high via a 1100 ohm pull up resistor while the remaining 7 bits are grounded producing a fixed byte of HEX 02.The least significant 8 bits are from the identification ,jumpers CID 8 DID 1. This is the second source of the data selector chips and this source connects to the B1,B2 inputs of the data selector chips.3. 17 bits from the 1K by 17 bit RAM 22 located on the CFE 10C output lines on the RAMnn bus 22 RAMA8 RAMD1 and RAMPAR which are connected to the C1 and C2 inputs of the data selector chips.4. 16 bits from the LPW generator 218 on the lines LPWnn which provide input to the data multiplexor 224. These bits are designated LPWA8 LPWD1 they are connected to the D1 and D2 inputs of the data selector chips of multiplexor 224. Vertical parity odd is generated for each of the 16 bit sources and connected to a chip H4 in 217, vertical parity circuit having inputs A2, B2, and D2. This is named PARGEN parity generation . The R H 22 output is the only source that supplies its own parity bit designated RAMPAR. The Table 20 listed below illustrates the charting for the selection of the source of input to the data selector multiplexor 224. TABLE 20 Source Selection for Input to Data Selector Multiplexor HPXdataB MPXdataA Data 0 O General Purpose Register O 1 ID word 1 0 RAM output 1 1 LPW The outputs of multiplexor 224 provide a path MP.Ynn to the DBUSnn. This is done via 3 tri state chips. These devices are enabled when the micro code generated signal ENSPX enable multiplexor is low . LPW GENERATOR CHECKER The longitudinal parity word generator checker 218 is made up of 16 JE flip flops. All of the clock inputs are driven by the micro code terms CTKTPW RG clock LPW registers. All the preset inputs are driven by the micro code term RESTLPW re set LPW which is gated with a clock 8CLK2 . The J and E inputs on each flip flop are tied together by one of the 16 bits on the DBUS. The output lines of the LPW generator 218 are designated LPWA8 LPWD1 and these provide one of the four inputs to the data multiplexor 224. The LPW generator 218 is initially reset to all l s by the micro code signal RESTLPW. The receive or transmit data is applied to the D3US as the input to the LPW generator. The micro code then applies a clock pulse to the LPW generator 218 CLKLPWRG . If an individual data bit is high , the associated flip flop toggles. If the data bit is low , the associated flip flop remains in its previous state. Each data word received or transmitte,d is placed on the DBUS and clocked by CTwTPWRG. For transmission from .the TP DLP, this data is transmitted to the main host system 10 as it is clocked into the LPW generator 218. After all the data has been transmitted, the 16 bit word left in the LPW generator is the longitudinal parity word and it is the next word transmitted to the main host system. For transmission nto the TP DLP, the LPW generator 218 is preset by the micro code signal RESTLPW. As each word is received, it is pres ented onto the D3USnn. The micro code generates CTKTPWRG in order to clock the LPW generator with this received data. Just like the data transmission operation of the LPW generator 218, the LPW generator contains a DLP generated longitudinal parity word. The last word received by the Train Printer Data Link Processor, on a data transfer, is the LPW from the host system 10. This LPW is gated onto the DBUS and is also clocked by the CLKLPWRG signal into the LPW generator 218.The data link processor generated LPW must equal the host system supplied LPW. The LPW will equal O if no LPW error occurs.IDENTIFICATION JUMPERS There are 8 identification jumpers 82 FIG. 3 located on the peripheral dependent board PDB 80 and these are named CID8 DID1. These signals are tied to 1100 ohm pull up resistors, which provide a logic high in the absence of a jumper. Individual signals are forced low with the installation of a jumper. These signals are fed to the data multiplexor 224.COMPARE LOGIC The compare logic 226 FIG. 5A uses two 4 bit comparator chips. These chips are configured in a tandem mode to provide comparison between two 8 bit sources. Source A for the compare logic is the 8 bit compare latch 215 which is made of two 4 bit counter chips. Source B is the 8 bit output of the two quad 2 1 multiplexor chips 83m. The 16 bit input to these multiplexors comes from the outputs of the RMM buffer 22 on line 22a. These 16 bits are divided into top and bottom 8 bit portions, according to their selection from the top half or bottom half of RAM 22. The SL inputs to the multiplexor chips 83m are tied together and controlled as to whether the top or the bottom 8 bit portion is selected. The SL inputs are tied to SELTh3H high equals bottom half which is a micro code signal. The compare register has LD load inputs which are tied to the low active term LATPRDAT load the compare register with print data which is micro code generated. Data from the multiplexor chips 83m is loaded into a compare register on the leading edge of the clock SLCK 3 en tlr term LATPRDAT is low. Data from this compare register is also the data path to format control. The output of the compare logic 226 is the term T3B equals PIB which is fed into an bit l multiplexor chip 221 . The micro code may use the ten p TIB P103 in order to generate the term AO by bringing up the micro code outputs num 3PJLNCR 5 and BRANCH 2. The term num BRANCH 5 effectively derives SEL2 low which enables the 8 multiplexor chip 221p causing the signal AO to reflect the state of TIB PIB.ERROR DETECTION The major part of error detection in the TT flLP is done in two 512 by 4 bit PROM chips. As seen inFIG. 5H these are designated PR 50a and 50b The signal OP DECSEL OP decode select is applied to tlin A8 address line inputs to the PROM chips PR 50 and toPR 50b. The OP decode select signal actually designates the function of the PROMS 1. when OPDECSEL is high , the PROM s 50a and 50b are used to docode the OP code and detects invalid OP codes.2. when OPDECSEL is low , the PROM s 50 and 5 are used for Vertical parity generation detection, LPW error detection, format error detection, and delimiter character detection.PROM 50a is p used to monitor the digits A and B of the DBUS while the PROM 50b monitors the digits C and D of the DBUS.The information on the DBUS is used as addresses to the PROMS. The PROM a and 50b and the CSO enable line inputs are always enabled, that is, grounded. The 8 PROM outputs produce a function that is determined by the 16 inputs in the DBUS. The Table 21 below shows the function of the 8 PROM outputs of 50a and 50b, TABLE 21 Error Detection PROMS PROM Output OPDECSEL 1 OPDECSEL .0 0 AO D1 OPDEC1 OP decode bit wt.l A digit bits 4, 2 and 1 AO D2 OPDEC2 OP decode bit wt.2 A B digits delimiter AO D3 OPDEC4 OP decode bit wt.4 A B digits 0 AO D4 OPDEC8 OP decode bit wt.8 A B digits are odd 80 D1 Not used BO D2 BOTCF Not used C D digits delimiter BO 03 LPWCD Not used C O digits w 0 BO D4 CDPARGEN Not used C D digits are oddVERTICAL PARITY GENERATION DETECTION As seen in Table 22, andFIG. 5H, the two output signals from the PROMs at 50 and 50b are used for vertical parity generation and detection. These are OPDEC8 ABPARGEN and CDPARGEN.The OPDECS is high for odd parity on the A and B digits of DBUS, while CDPARGEN is high for odd parity on the C and D digits. TABLE 22 Vertical Parity Generation DetectionCDPARGEN A3PARGEN PARGEN DBUSPR PARERROR O 0 1 0 1 O 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0For vertical parity generation it is necessary to generate a nhigh level for even parity and a low level for odd parity. For vertical parity detection, it is necessary to generate a high level to indicate a parity error if either of the following two conditions exist 1. The parity bit is high while the 16 bits of data have an odd number of bits ON .2. The parity bit is low while the 16 bits of data have an even number of bits ON . As seen in FIG. SI these functions are generated by a dual 4 1 data selector chip S4. SLA and SLB are the select inputs to the data selector chip S4. The signal PARGEN is a parity bit input to the data path multiplexor 224. The micro code selection of the ,mXtiplexor inputs determine when this PARGEN bit is used. The signal PARERROR parity error is sent to the CFE 10C as TEST 5 via the foreplane to be tested by th,e micro code,LPW ERROR DETECTION Two output signals from the PROMs 50a, 5 , , are used for LPW error detection as will be seen ion Table 21, previously shown heieinbefore and in FIG. q These two output signals are named OPDEC4 LPWAB and LPWCD.OPDEC4 LPWAB is high if the A and B digits of DBUS equal 0.LPWCD is high if the C and D digits of DBUS equal 0. As seen in FIG. 5H the PROM outputs OPDEC4 and LPWCD are fed into the NAND gate 50g thus developing the output signal LPWERROR high equals error . This signal is sent to the CFE 10 as TEST 6 via the foreplane to be tested by the 0 micro code. FORvT ERROR DETECTION The two output signals of FIG. 5H, with reference to Table 21, from the PROMs 50a and 50b are used in checking for valid format commands on multiple line operations. These signals are named OPDEC1 digit A equals 8 or A equals 0 and LPWCD. The signal OPDEC1 is high if digit A of DBUS equals 8 or equals 0. LPWCD is high if C and D digits equal 0. The previous Table 12, under note 2 shows the composition of the format word. Referring to FIG. SH, the PROM outputs OPDEC1 instead of OPDEC4 and LPWCD are fed into the NAND gate 5Og developing the output signal FORERROR instead of LPWEPROR high equals error . This signal is sent to the CFE 10C as TEST 10 via the foreplane and to be tested by the micro code. DELDIITER CHARACTER DETECTION The two output signals from the PROMs 50a and 50b are also used for delimiter character detection as seen in Table 21 and FIG. 5J. These signals are named OPDEC2 TOPCF and BOTCF which refer to top and bottom . The signal OPDEC2 TOPCF is loon if A and B digits of DBUS equal HEX CF which is the delimiter character . The signal BOTCF is low if the C and D digits of DBUS equal HEX CF as seen in FIG. 5J. PROM outputs OPDEC2 and 3oTCF are fed into the NAND gate 50g, thus developing the output signal DELFOUND delimiter found . This signal is sent to the CFE 10c as TEST 8 via the foreplane to be tested by the micro code highn equals delimiter found . After the micro code detects a delimiter, it tests to see if the delimiter was detected in the A and B digits or, in the C and D digits, by testing the signal TEST 9 top delimiter which is also sent to the CFE 10C via the foreplane low equals top delimiter . OPERATION DECODE OPDEC As seen in FIG. 5H, the operation, decoding is performed by PROM 50a when the address A8 input OPDECSEL is high . This signal is controlled by micro code and is forced high ihen OP decoding is desired. This PROM, while OPDECSEL is high, serves the function of monitoring A and B digits of DBUS and generates OPDEC lines corresponding to the operation to be performed, according to Table 23, which is shown below.

Undefined Any invalid undefined bit code in A and 3 digits produces an output of HEX 7 on the OPDECn lines. No bit code in theA and B digits will produce an output of HEX E or F on theOPDECn lines when OPDECSEL is high, the PROM 50 is not programmed to output this bit pattern . These OPDECn lines are sent to the CFE 10 via the foreplane to be used as c inputs to the address multiplexor 12.This enables the micro code program to perform a 16 way branch on the OP code.FIG. SA shows the four OPDECODE lines from 83d which feed over to address multiplexor 12.STOP BIT GETRATION As seen in FIG. 5E there is shown aPROM which provides the stop bit generation. This PROM 5Os produces s high out of line output D4 which is named INTERFLG which means STOP bit in the micro code . This is done for any one of the following conditions 1. a delimiter was detected.2. the BC register reached the maximum count BC FF .3. a vertical parity error occurred.4. a terminate was received from the main host system. The micro code may use the stop bit iNTERFLG in order to generate the term Ao by bringing up the proper micro code num 3RANCH lines.CONTROL LOGIC Referring to FIG. 5A and control logic 222, a 3 8 decoder is enabled during 8CLK1 time. The micro code output signals CONmAI 1, 2 and 3, are used to make the decoder produce a low output from RSETPCSL reset PCSL from LDREGCAD load register column address or loadAD register from tiECOLDN write enable to invalid RAM from RSETTIB reset train image buffer load from SETCSLF set CSLF or none at all. Another 3 8 decoder is constantly enabled, thus producing a low output depending on the binary weight of its output signals CONTRAD 4, 5 and 6, which are micro code signals.The outputs that may be driven nlow are MPXSELAD high select adder output as the input to theAccumulator the DMCOL data input, to column done RAM to DnAMINV data input to invalid RAM to LATPRDAT latch print data into compare register the load input to the 4 bit binary counter in the compare logic or no outputs at all. Another 4 bit binary counter in logic block 222 is used as a 4 bit latch it has inputs num CONST 4 through 7 micro code outputs which are latched by LOADCONT load control register which is a micro code output being low at the leading edge of the clock 8 CLK 1. Its outputs are OPDECSEL OP decode select ,DClLCTR DC1L, control register output , DC2LCTR DC2L, control register output and DTlLCTRL DTL control register output . The 4 bit counter in the compare logic is used as a 4 bit latch. It has inputs num CONST 0 through 3 micro code outputs which are latched by the Y7 output of the second 3 8 decoder during the leading edge of clock 8 CLK 1., The 4 bit counter has outputs at 220 which are RAMAD 8 RAM buffer address line 8 and MOSTCTR the motor start signal for the printer . AO ADDRESS GENERATION The micro code within the CFE 10 does 0 bit tests on desired conditions by gating these conditions onto the AO line which is seen in FIGS. 4A and SA. This line A0 is the least significant bit of the micro code PROM address. The desired test condition bit is selected by the num BRANCH lines and the num I4 from the micro code. The num BRANCH 4, 5 and BR6 num I1 lines develop the SELn lines. The followingTable 24 indicates all of the test conditions on the PDB 80 which are used for AO line generation and the terms needed to select then.

Micro code simply means object code or program code.The PROM outputs from the PROM micro code registers 14 on the OFE card change to produce the new micro code word on the leading edge of PROMCLK . Referring to Table 25, the TP DLP is normally in idle status status 3 . In this state it can accept an I O descriptor from the host system. The TP DLP receives an I O descriptor while at status 3, goes to status 11, and receives the I O descriptor LPW. The TP DLP then goes to status 6 to receive the two descriptor links and their LPW.The DLP then goes to status 1 and performs a 16 way branch dependent upon the OP code which it receives as part of the I O descriptor at status 3 time. On the loading of the train image buffer as seen inFIG. 5F, description of the train image buffer load operation, by status count is shown in Table 25 herein TABLE 25 Status 03 1. Idle. 2.

TP DLP STATUS DEFINITIONS DLP status information is the means by which the TP DLP communicates it s conditions and requirements.to the host system 10. Status states are transmitted by theTP DLP when it is connected to the host system. The use of status states is designed to allow the message transfers between the TP DLP and the host system to be conducted in an orderly manner. The following Table 26 defines each individual status state operation used specifically in the Train Printer DataLink Processor TABLE 26 Status States TP DLP Status 0 Cleared. The DLP is the cleared state. status is asynchronously entered when the DLP is master clcarcd, local cleared, or sclective cleared.Status 1. Disconnect. The DLP is busy and cannot accept a new 10 descriptor. Status X 3 idle. The DLP can accept an 110 descriptor at this time. Status 4 Read data. This is the read buffer portion of an echo operation. Status S Send descriptor link. The DLP is sending the de scriptor links and their longitudinal parity word LPW to the host system. Status 2 6 Receive descriptor links. The DLP is receiving is ready to receive, the descriptor links and t LPW. Status 7 Result descriptor. The DLP sends the result dc scriptor to the host system with the next DLP strobe. Status 8 Write data The DLP can accept train image or print image huflrcr data from the host system. Status 9 Encoded status back up . Indicates to the host system that DLP address baclc up information is present on the data lines. Status 11 Receive dcscriptor LPW. This status informs the host system that the DLP expects to receive the UO descriptor LPW. Status 12 Break. The DLP requires no more data because it has reached an end condition The host system sends the data L W with the next strobe. Status 14 Character transfer. Used by the DLP to handle single character transfers from the host system or to receive the last character or word from the host system. This status acts like a request to the host system in that it requests the host system to notify it of whether or not the last word sent to it from the host system was a single character 8 bits or a fuU word. The host system rcsponds with the next SllOL and a terminate, if the word sent was a single character, and responds with an STIOL and no terminate, if the last word was a full word. Status IS Result descriptor LPW. The DLP is sending the result descriptor. The LPW will follow with the next DLP strobe. PCTP GENERATION This refers to the printer column timing pulse generator which generates the printer column timing pulse PCTP in FIG. 5D. The PCTP generator is made of a binary counter, a SJK flipflop, 2 NOR gates and a tri state inverter. InFIG. SA, the PCTP generator is shown as the element 232. The binary counter is the heart of this timing network and the printer column timing pulse jumpers are installed in accordance with the speed rating of the printer. Maximum PCTP frequency is achieved when no jumpers are installed then a slowerPCTP frequency is produced as jumpers are installed.The binary counter, increments on the leading edge of the clock 8CLK . As the counter reaches the count of 16, a carry output is generated 125 nanoseconds positive pulse . This pulse is supplied to the J and K inputs to the flip flop and causes it to toggle with the next trailing edge of the clock 8CLX . The carry output is also inverted by a NOR gate and fed to the LD loaf input of the binary counter which causes the binary counter to be loaded with thevalue of the PCTP jumpers. The cycle is then repeated. For 1100 lines per minute LPSI operation, all the PCTP jumpers are installed, thus forcing the binary counter to count through all 16 steps before emitting a carry output. The signal FIG. 5D PCTP from the tri state inverter is a 250 kilohert square wave 2 micro sec ond pulse width . The signal PCTPFLAG is a 125 nanosecond positive pulse occcurring at 4 micro second intervals which flags the micro code at the end of each PCTP pulse.PERIPHERAL INTERFACE The printer interface control 220 is seen in FIG. 5A. The TP DLP receives 9 signals from the printer 50p and feeds them into tri state inverters. These asynchronous signals are converted to synchronous signals and then used as inputs for AO branching as seen in Table 24. The signal PRSL , from the printer 50p, is not fed through a chip because it is a level rather than a pulse and needs no synchronization. The Train Printer Data Link Processor sends out 8 signals to the printer 50p. All these interface signals are driven by tri state inverters,. and all the tri state interface drivers and receivers are except the DTnL lines enable when GPRIF gate maintenance peripheral line signal is low .The interface signals between the printer interface 220 and the printer 50p are shown below in Table 27. TABLE 27 Printer Interface to DLP FROH PRINTER Foreplane Signal Pin PCSL 587 CSL 586 PFCL 588 PAML 589 EDPL 590 CIDL 595 PR1L 585 PR2L 596 PRSL 591 TO PRIHTER Foreplane Signal Pin OCIL 578 DC2L 579 MOST 584 PCTP 577 DT8L 583 DT4L 582 DT2Lt 581 Dull 580 PRINT AND FORMAT CONTROL The Train Printer Data Link Processor commands the printer 50p either to remain idle, to print data, or to advance paper by way of the DC1L and the DC2L signal lines which carry signals shown in FIG. 5D. Printer SOP decodes and responds to the signals as shown in Table 28. TABLE 28 Data Control Level Signals Binary DC2S DC1L printer Response 0 0 O No action 1 0 1 Print 2 1 0 Format 3 1 1 Invalid When DCnL 2, the DTnL lines, from interface 220, contain format information for the printer. However, whileDCnL 1, then only DT1L of the DTnL lines is used and it is high for a data match. The 3 8 line decoder in interface 220, FIG. 5A, is disabled only if a PROM parity error occurs. This 3 8 line decoder produces a low active signal at the output corresponding to the binary weight of the three input lines. The signal GPRIF originates on the Maintenance Card 20om and is high to effectively disconnect the PDB peripheral cable lines and replace them with peripheral simulation lines. The mentioned 3 8 decoder, in interface 220, operates in two modes, which is to say maintenance and normal depending upon the signal state of GPRIF , the third input to the 3 8 decoder chip. The normal mode of operation is withGPRIF high thus enabling ENDTX1 enable DT1L , ENFOR enable fornat or neither. The signal ENDTX1 , when low, enables a tri state inverter which supplies the format information to the printer 50p from a 4 bit binary counter in interface 220. GPRIF, when low, also supplies the DCnL signals to the printer 50p. PERIPHERAL LINES FOR MAINTENANCE The lines designated PRIFnn O are used by the Maintenance Card 20cm to verify and check the operation of the peripheral dependent board PDB of the Train Printer Data Link Processor. These PRIFnn O lines are enabled by tri state chips located in the TP DLP. These peripheral maintenance lines are enabled when the signal GPRIF is low . The signal GPRIF originates at the maintenance card MC 20om These lines permit simulation of the Train Printer by means of the Maintenance Card 20om The following Table 29 shows a listing of these simulated peripheral lines, PRIFnn O, and also shows the corresponding inputs and outputs to the aforementioned tri state chips. TABLE 29 Maintenance Card Lines to from PDB PRIF Lines Outputs Inputs PRIF01 0 MPCTP PRIF02 0 MPC1L PRIF03 0 MDC2L PRIF04 0 MPC8L PRIF05 0 MPC4L PRIFO6 O MT2L PRIF07 0 MTIL PRIF08 0 MPRSL PRIFO9 O MPCSL PRIF10 0 MCSL PRIF11 0 MPFCL PRIFi2 O MPAML PRIF13 0 MEDPL PRIF14 0 MCIDL PRIFl5 O MPRlL PRIF16 0 MPR2L PRIF17 0 MDST MAINTENANCE DISPLAY LINES The Train Printer Data Link Processor contains three 8 1 multiplexor chips that are used to enable thePDB 80 at its maintenance display lines DPLYll O DPLY13 0, as can be referred to in Table 21 .These lines are used by theMaintenance Card 200m to verify and check the operation of the peripheral dependent board PDB of the Train Printer Data LinkProcessor. The DSELn lines are used to select the internal signals that are enabled onto the backplane maintenance bus.The DSELn lines are sent to the PDB 80 from the Common FrontEnd, CFE 10c and are enabled when the data link processor is Maintenance Card addressed.DATA LINK PROCESSOR INTERFACE TO TRAIN PRINTER Referring toFIG. 5A there is shown the printer interface control 220 having connections to the Train Printer 50p also referring to FIG. 5D which shows a timing diagram for the interface control signals to the Train Printer, the following discussion will describe this interface with respect to a typical Train Printer such as the 1100 line per minute Train Printer. The printer column timing pulse PCTP is a 2.0 microsecond pulse operating at a frequency of 250 kilohertz. It is during the information transfer cycle , that the PCTP is used to gate bit information into column storage and also to advance the printer column counter. The printer column timing pulse signals are always transmitted when power.is on in the printer. All of the interface signals start with the trailing edge of the PCTP, except the signals MOST motor start and the signal EDPL end of page level . There are two data control level signals designated asDC1L and DC2L Table 28 . The data control levels when true indicate that either print information or format control information is present on the data transfer lines DTXL . The control levels will change state only on the trailing edge of the PCTP. A print cycle starts with the receipt of DC1L andDC2L being equal to binary 1 and terminates only upon the receipt of signals DOlL and DC2L being to binary 2. The paper motion cycle starts with the receipt of signals DC1L andDC2L being to binary 2 and terminates on the trailing edge of the signal PAML paper motion level , going false at the same time that PCSL printer column strobe level is false . The binary 1 state will go true at the trailing edge of the first PCTP alter PCSL if there is bit information to be transferred into the printer column storage. Data is transferred into column storage, and the column counter is advanced at the rate of PCTP. Print columns are counted starting with column 1.A space suppress code format 0 must be transmitted if a particular column is to be printed again on the same line. A binary 1 state must be followed by a binary 2 state if the printer is to be made not ready . The binary 2 state may be transmitted any time the PAML level is false , and must be present a minimum of 1 PCTP period. Response to the binary 2 state will not occur until PCSL goes false . The binary 2 state will be transmitted at least once for each line printed. DATA TRANSFER LINES The data transfer lines are designatedDT1L, DT2L, DT4L, DTSL. When the control levels DC1L andDC2L are P to binary 1, the data transfer line DT1L is used to transfer print information into the printer column storage.Data is always transferred from the data transfer lines to the printer at the trailing edge of the printer column timing pulse. When the control levels DC1L and DC2L are to binary. 2, the data transfer lines DT1L, DT2L, DT4L, DT8L are used to transfer format information to the printer. The data transfer lines are shown on the followingTable. TABLE 30 Data Transfer Lines to Printer DT1L, DT2L, DT4L, DT8L, DATA TRANSFER LINES DURING TRANSFER OF FORMAT INFORMATION, THE BINARY SUM, DTXL, OF THE DATA TRANSFER LINES RESULT IN THE FOLLOWING DT L Q NO ADVANCE SPACE SUPPRESS . DTXL . 1 ADVANCE TO HEAO NG POSITION. DTXL 2 11 ADVANCE TO DESIGNATED FIELD POSITION. DTXL 12 ADVANCE TO END Or PAGE POSITION. DTXL 13 INVALID CODE. CAUSED A ONE SECOND PAPER SLEW AND A PAPER SLEW INDICATION ON THE FUNCTION INDICATOR PANEL. DTXL 14 ADVANCE SINGLE SPACE DTXL 15 ADVANCE DOUBLE SPACE The motor start level MOST when true , is used to start the train drive motor from a remote location wheneverPR1L is true which indicates that the printer is in a ready state, and when PR2L is false indicating the train drive motor is off. The data transfer lines involve the signals to theTrain Printer from an external device such as the data link processor. This is also true of the motor start level signalMOST. There are signals which the printer provides to the data link processor which are called the printer ready levels and which are designated PR1L and PR2L. The printer ready level PR1L when true indicates that the power is on the paper is loaded there is no slew alarm the train is installed and locked in the print position the ready switch is depressed. The depression of the single print switch will override the paper out switch and allow PR1L to go true . When the signal PR2L is also true , the train drive motor is on . After the signal PR2L goes true , with also PR1L being true, the first signal DC1L or DC2L which is received from the interface control 220 initiates a print or paper motion cycle. If the ready switch is depressed when the printer is in a print operation, the PR1L and the PR2L levels will be inhibited from changing state until a minimum of one PCTP clock period after the following PAML paper motion level signal has been initiated. The indicated paper motion operation is completed even though the printer is not ready. The printer cannot be made not ready if the last command was a print command DClL and DC2L being to binary 1 . The ready levels will change state only on the trailing edge of the PCTP and when the PCSL printer column strobe level is false . TABLE 31 Printer Ready Level Signals to DLP PR2L PR1L O O Not Ready Binary O O 1 Ready Train Motor Off Binary 1 1 0 Invalid Code Binary 2 1 1 Ready Train Motor On Binary 3 Referring again to the timing diagram of FIG. 5D, the scan cycle within the printer is monitored by t he printer column strobe level or PCSL. The signal PCSL, when true , in conjunction with PR1L and PR2L being true , indicates the printer is prepared to accept information into column storage.The PCSL signal changes state only on the trailing edge of thePCTT printer column timing pulse . As seen in FIG. 5D, one scan set consists of fourPCSL pulses. In the case of 1100 LPM printer, the minimum pulse length for the PCSL is 144 micro seconds. Data for columns 1, 5, 9 and 13 is transferred during the first PCSL of a scan set. Then data for columns 2, 6, 10 and 14 is transferred during the second PCSL of the scan set. Then data for columns 3, 7, 11 and 15 is transferred during the third PCSL of a scan set. Then data for columns 4, 8, 12 and 16 is transferred during the fourth PCSL of a scan set. A minimum of four PCSL s or one scan set are required to transfer a full line of print. The second graphic on each train is the graphic in print position 1 during the firstPCSL of a scan set following the chain syne level CSL , also called the train sync level., The train sync level is designated CSL and is a signal which occurs once per train revolution. It defines the beginning of the train set. The signal CSL changes state only on the trailing edge of PCTP. The CSL is true for 6 PCTP s and it goes true one pulse before the end of the fourthPCSL of a scan set.TRAIN IDENTIFICATION LEVEL The train identification level designated CIDL is a six bit code transmitted serially most significant bit coming first and each bit is six pulses PCTP s wide. ,Each identification bit originates one pulse before the end of every sixth PCSL following a chain sync level CSL sync signal. The identification bits change state only on the trailing edge of PCTP. This identification will only appear once per train revolution. PRINTER FINAL COLUMN LEVEL This signal is designated PFCL and this level goes true at the trailing, edge of the PCTP prior to the information transfer for the last character of the sub scan. The printer will accept one additional informational bit after PFCL goes true . The signal PFCL changes state on the trailing edge of the PCTP. At the end of each sub scan, the printer final column level PFCL goes false when the signal PCSL goes false . PAPER MOTION LEVEL This signal, designated PAML goes true in response to format information on the data transfer lines DTXL, and when data control levels DC1L and DC2L binary 2. The paper motion signal PAML remains true until the defined paper advance is complete. PAML changes state only on trailing edge of the pulse PCTP when PCSL is false. If the signals DC1L and DC2L are to binary 2 during a sub scan PCSL then the signal PAML will not change state until PCSL goes false. If the printer receives a space suppress code format 5 0 , the printer will issue a PAML level with a time duration that will approximate a single line advance, unless PR1L and PR2L are to change state, in which case the printer will issue a PAML level with a minimum time duration of one PCTP clock period on the interface before the printer changes to a not ready state, as in Table 31. Whenever the PAML line is true , the control device 220 must wait until the printer has completed the operation which caused PAML to become true before issuing any following command to the printer. The signal PAML becoming false indicates the operation has been completed.END OF PAGE LEVEL This signal is designated EDPL and this level, when true, , indicates that the end of page was sensed during a paper advance in a single or double space mode DTXL binary 14 or binary 15 . The signal EDPL is reset when paper motion information is transmitted for the next line except when DTXL O . The EDPL signal is not synchronized with the printer column timing pulses PCTP. PRINT CYCLE The printing of characters is controlled by scanning the message to be printed and comparing it with the TIB train image buffer. The character position in the print buffer corresponds to the hammer position in the train printer. The address of the train image buffer TIB corresponds to the character positioned over the hammer. If the 8 bit entry in the train image buffer TIB is equal to the 8 bit code in the print buffer, a set level signal is sent to the printer and that particular hammer is fired on the next print cycle of the printer. A pointer accumulator 212 and register 230 into the train image buffer TIB is kept synchronized with the movement of the train characters. During print scans, the print message is scanned and the address of the train image buffer is changed in order to correspond with the characterhammer positions. This continues until all the characters in the print buffer have been printed. In FIG. 5D, there was described the accumulator 212 working in conjunction with register 230 and the column done logic 214. The accumulators 212 together with registers 23,0, are the elements which act as.the pointers heretofore mentioned in FIGS. 5A and 5D. Table 18 indicates the usage at the accumulators 212. COMPARE LOGIC CIRCUITRY FOR THE DATA LINK PROCESSOR With reference to Fig. SA, the compare logic circuitry combines the use of compare logic 226 as receipt for signals from source A and B with latch circuit 215 and multiplexor 8E. Fig. 5L shows, in schematic form, the compare logic circuit relationships . The compare logic consists of two 4 bit comparator chips F1 and G1. These chips are configured in a tandem mode to provide comparison between two 8 bit sources designated source A and source B. Source A is the compare logic for the 8 bit compare latch jut15 comprised of two 4 bit counter chips Dl and El. Source B is the 8 bit output of the two quad 2 1 multiplexor C83m chips Do and E. 0 The 16 bit input to the multiplexor chipsDo and Eo comes from the RAM buffer output from RAM 22. These 16 bits are divided into top and bottom 8 bit portions. The SL inputs to the multiplexor chips Do and E0 83m are tied together and are used to control whether the top or the bottom 8 bit portion is selected. The SL inputs are tied to SELTHBH high signal a bottom half which is a micro code signal. The chips for the compare latch registerD1 and E1 have LD load inputs which are tied to the low active term LATPRDAT load the compare register with printed data . The term LATPRDAT is micro code generated. Data from the multiplexor chips CD,, Eo is loaded onto the compare register D1, E1 on the leading edge of 8 CLK 3 when the term LATPRDAT is low . Data from the compare register D1, E1 also forms a data path to format control. The output of the compare logic F1, G1 is the term TIB a PIB, which signal is fed to the 8 1 multiplexor chip P4. The micro code may use the term TIB PIB in order to generate the term AO by bringing up the micro code outputs num BRANCHS and num BRANCH2. The term num BRANCHS will effectively drive the line SEL 2 low which will enable the 8 1 multiplexor chipP4 causing the signal AO to reflect the state ofTIB o PIB. ,The signal AO is shown on FIG. 5A as address line generation 221p which connects to PROM 13 and stack register 11. LINE TURN AROUND LOGIC CIRCUIT In regard to the line turn logic shown in FIG. 5M, this circuitry controls the direction of data flow between the Distribution Card 20od via the backplane and the Train Printer Data Link Processor, as seen in FIG. 5A. a In one direction flow, the Drivers 228 take data from the DBUS and supply it to the Distribution Control Card 200d through the backplane connections 200B b In the other direction with the line turned around by line turn logic, the Receivers 110 receive data from the Distribution Card and feed it on the DBUS where it transmits to the vertical parity check generator 217 to the longitudinal parity word generator 218 to the OP decoder 83d and to the INRAFI bus which goes on line 100 to RAM 22. In the direction a the data multiplexor 224 provides data to the DBUSnn which feeds Drivers 228 so as to convey data to the Distribution Control Card 20od via the backplane 200B However, in direction b , the multiplexor 224 can shut off so that the Distribution Control Card transmits data to the Receivers 110 which provides data to the DBUS of the Train Printer Data Link Processor where the data is conveyed to elements 217, 218, 83d and 22 of FIG. 5A. Thus, the line turn logic shown in FIG. 5M controls the flow of data a from the Distribution Control DC 20od Card to the Data Link Processor b from the Train Printer Data Link Processor via the multiplexor 224 to the Drivers 228 and thence to the Distribution Control Card 20 Referring to FIG. SM, the line turn logic constitutes a PROM 302 having six input signals described below 1 OFFLINE this signal, when low, signifies that the DLP is in local mode for maintenance and check out purposes. 2 LOCAL this signal, when low, indicates the Maintenance Card has access to the Train Printer DLP. 3 IOSF this is a signal from the I O send flip flop to the PDB 80. 4 CONECT this signal, when low , indicates a DLP is connected to the main host system via the Distribution Card 200d 5 SW1 switch signal from Maintenance Card. 6 PERF this signal is from the Parity Error flip flop on the CFE card 10C and used to kill the signal to the Train Printer. The four outputs of PROM 302 are fed to a hex register 304. Two of its outputs are fed to a tri state buffer 306 which has outputs as follows a RCV this receive signal, when low turns on the Receivers 110 DATAnn lines to receive data from Distribution Card 20. b SIMRCV this signal, generated by the line turn logic in PDB 80, is used during maintenance testing to simulate the DATAn lines to Receivers 110. The hex register 304 has two outputs c and d defined as follows c XMIT this transmit signal, when low enables Drivers 228 in order to send data to the Distribution Card 200d d LOCDIS this is the local display signal which activates the data simulate DXIMxn lines to the Maintenance Card. Thus, the four outputs a , b , c and d will depend on the input states as follows 1. XMIT is low when all of the following conditions are met a. CONECT is low. b. SWl is high. c. IOSF is high. d. PERF is high. e. OFFLINE is high. 2. RCV is low when all of the following conditions are met a. CONECT is low b. SW1 is high. c. IOSF is low. d. PERF is high. e. OFFLINE is high. 3. LOCDIS is low when one of the following conditions is met a. All of the following conditions are met 1 SW1 is high. 2 IOSF is high. 3 OFFLINE is low. 4 LOCAL is low. b. All of the following conditions are met 1 SW1 is high. 2 OFFLINE is high. 3 LOCAL is low. 4. SIMRCV is low when one of the following conditions is met a. All of the following conditions are met 1 SW1 is high. 2 IOSF is low. 3 OFFLINE is low. 4 LOCAL is low. b. SW1 is low. Referring to FIG. 5M 1, there is seen a block diagram of the major elements involved in the dual flow control system where the logic means 302, 304 of FIG. 5M controls two different bus connection systems. In FIG. 5M 1, the DR bus connects the distribution card 200d to receivers 110 and drivers 228. The bidirectional bus DR is a single bus which is seen in FIG.5M 1 as having two portions for illustrative and clarification purposes . The control signals RCV and XMIT to the receivers 110 and drivers 228 determine the directional flow of data either to the RAM buffer 22 or from the RAM buffer 22 via the D bus also shown in FIG. 5A . Similarly, when the maintenance mode is initiated by the host computer 10, the maintenance test circuit card 200m is connected through the backplane to receivers 110M and drivers 228M on the bidirectional bus MDR of FIG. 5M 1. In the maintenance mode condition, the flow control logic 302, 304, of FIG. 5M, will use the SIMRCV and LOCDIS signals to control receivers 110M and drivers 228M to establish the flow direction to be operable on bidirectional bus MDR which will then determine whether test data flows to , RAM 22 or from RAM 22. It will be understood that the preferred embodiments described herein are only exemplary and that they are susceptible of many modifications and variations in construction, arrangement and use, without departing from the spirit of the invention as defined by the appended claims.
