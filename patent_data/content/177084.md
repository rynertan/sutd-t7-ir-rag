# Profile working machine.

## Abstract
A profile working machine is equipped with a support 1 for holding a work 2 in place, a working tool 6 for machining the work and drive and control systems 11 for controlling the relative displacements between the support and working tool and adapted to machine the work into a desired profile. It is additionally provided with a load sensor 8 for detecting each force and moment to be developed between the working tool and the work, a first computing unit 15B for computing a working point and a tangential plane extending through the working point and in contact with the working tool, on the basis of the force and moment detected by the load sensor, and a second computing unit 15C for computing, based on the working point and tangential plane computed by the first computing unit and the forces detected by the load sensor, the values of the relative displacements between the working tool and the support in order to keep the magnitude and the direction of a reaction force exerted on the working tool on predetermined values.
