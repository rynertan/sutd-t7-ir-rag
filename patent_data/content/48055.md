# LAMINATE REINFORCEMENT FOR FIBRE REINFORCED SYNTHETIC RESINS

## Abstract
The invention relates to a laminate reinforcement for fibre reinforced sunthetic resins and has for its object to provide a laminate reinforcement of highly resistant and high elasticity modulus fibres for extremely heavy duty, yet light weight and indent resistent floating bodies and pro vides to that purpose such a reinforcement in which the laminate reinforcement is obtained by means of at least two parallel tissue tapes forming by their tissue seams a paunch gap, which is covered with a similar, but narrower covering tape, doubling of the reinforcing fibres in the area of the paunch gap in parallel relationship producing a Stringer effect, in which the wrap and weft yarns of the tissue tape are made from reinforcing fibres having a higher elasticity modulus and a higher specific tensile strength than glass fibres, said fibres consisting of carbon, aramid, boron fibres or the like, the warp yarns of carbon and aramid being in intimate contact with one another and the weft yarns of aramid or carbon being spaced spaced apart in parallel relationship by a larger distance than the warp yarns.
