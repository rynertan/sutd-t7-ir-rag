## Abstract
Apparatus for feeding fibres, and particularly worsted fibres to a carding machine that may be a conventional worsted card or conventional cotton card. The apparatus comprises a stationary feed plate 1 , a rotatable feed roller 2 and a rotatable takerin 3 for carrying fibres from the feed roller and transferring them to the surface of a carding cylinder. The surface of the takerin is furnished with pins at a pin density of not more than 36 pins per square inch 5.58 pins per square centimetre and the distance B between the feed plate and the envelope of the tips of the pins on the takerin is from 0.3 to 0.75 inch 0.76 to. 19.5 mm . Using this low pin density and wide spacing between the feed plate and the envelope of the pin tips effects ex cellent cleaning of worsted and other long staple fibre before it passes to the carding cylinder.
