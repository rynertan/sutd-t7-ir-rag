# Apparatus for recording and or reading information on an optically readable disc.

## Abstract
An apparatus for recording and or reading information in an optically readable disc 3 comprises a carrier 6 which can be driven along a first axis 4 in order to move a lens system 1 , which is arranged on the carrier relative to the disc. The lens system is also driven along said first axis by drive means 33 which act directly, i.e. not via the support ing means 21, 22 in order to minimize the load exerted on these supporting means.
