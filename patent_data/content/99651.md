# Optical data storage.

## Abstract
A data storage member 1 comprises recording material for recording information 5 which can be imaged using non coherent light and in addition to and distinct from that information, the member has control data 7, 8, 9 which defines a two co ordinate system for the member to provide for random access to the information. A reading recording apparatus comprises a non laser optical system for imaging onto selected areas and a servo system, including a microprocessor and transducers, for reading the control data and for positioning a head of the optical system in desired locations relative to the storage member. The invention affords cheap optical data bases recordable and readable by apparatus not requiring a laser optical system.
