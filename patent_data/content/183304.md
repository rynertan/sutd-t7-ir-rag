# A rotary drying drum.

## Abstract
A rotary cylindrical drying drum comprising in axial direction a series of vaned sections, with air and material passages, and in which material to be dried can enter each section via an annular slot disposed along the drum wall and be transported by the vanes in radial direction, and material transporting vanes on either side of each section disposed against the drum wall for axially transporting the material to be dried. According to the invention, each section 7 includes two double walled, frusto conical portions whose apices are directed towards one another, the apices of the outer cones 1 being interconnected to form an air and material passage 4 , with the edges of the base circles being connected to the drum wall 8 and the inner cones 2 being connected to the outer cones 1 by means of spacers.
