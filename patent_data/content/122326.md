There are, of course, additional features of the invention that will be described more fully hereinafter. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the conception on which this desclosure is based may readily be utilized as the basis for the designing of other arrangements for carrying out the several purposes of the invention. It is important, therefore, that the disclosure be regarded as including such other arrangements and do not depart from the spirit and scope of the invention. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSA preferred embodiment of the invention has been chosen for purposes of illustration and description, and is shown in the accompanying drawings, forming a part of the specification wherein Figure 1 is a schematic representation of an apparatus for manufacturing security strips according to the method of the invention Figure 2 is an exploded view representing the components of a security strip manufactured by the apparatus ofFigure 1 Figure 3 is a top plan view of a further exemplary embodiment of a group of security strips with an arrangement of notches andFigure 4 is a top plan view of a further exemplary embodiment of a group of security strips with additionally imprinted information relating to the product to be safeguarded, and with spaces for individual price marking. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTThe apparatus represented in Figure 1 comprises a first supply reel 10 from which a continuous carrier band 11 provided with a double sided adhesive film 71 is unwound.The carrier band passes from the reel 10 and around a dancer roller unnumbered . The dancer roller moves up and down between limit switches not shown as the carrier band 11 is advanced. When the dancer roller contacts the upper limit switch the reel 10 is driven to unwind it and when the dancer roller contacts the lower limit switch the reel drive is stopped. This arrangement permits advancement of the carrier band by pulling it, yet without requiring it to be pulled hard enough to turn the reel 10. The carrier band 11 passes from the dance roller up through a brake 103 and a guide roll unnumbered to advance along a straight horizontal path. The adhesive film 111 is so arranged on the carrier band that it is on the upper surface of the band as the band moves along the horizontal path.At the opposite end of the horizontal path there is provided an intermittent feedunit 12 which advances the band along the horizontal path in discrete increments, each increment preferably corresponding to the length of one security strip. A preferred form of the intermittent feed unit is the Model BV 50 100 pneumatic feed unit manufactured by Festo Pneumatic of 395 Moreland Road, hauppagere, New York 17788. The feed unit 12 operates at a speed of approximately 100 cycles per minute.A plurality of continuous bands 13 of magnetically hard magnetizeable material are drawn simultaneously, likewise in fixed cycles, from a plurality of supply reels 12, and are deflected by way of associated deflecting means 12 coordinated with each suply reel 12, in such a way that the ends of the bands 13 are aligned with the plane of the carrier band 11. The bands 13 are then cut off into strip sections or elements 13 of equal length by means of cutting means 18 coordinated with each deflecting means 12 . These strip sections or elements 13 are then applied in uniform alignment with one another to the self adhesive film 11 of the carrier band 11 and are combined with this carrier band by contact pressure devices not shown . Each deflecting means 12 and associated cutting means 18 comprises an element depositing station.In the preferred embodiment the deflecting means 12t comprises a pair of closely spaced blocks having mutually facing, closely spaced curved surfaces which together form a curved slot which accomodates the band 13 and guides it from a vertical direction to a nearly but not fully horizontal direction in which it extends down toward the carrier band 11 at an acute angle.Drive rollers not shown for the bands 13 are provided just above the deflecting means 12 and these drive rollers are synchronized with the feed unit 12 so that between successive advancements of the carrier band 11, tllat is when it is at rest, the drive rollers advance the bands 13 slolm through the cu ved slots in their respective deflecting means 1211 by a predetermined amount corresponding to the length of the strip sections or elements 13 to be deposited onto the carrier band 11.The deflecting means 1211 are each positioned and arranged sucli that when the bands 13 have been so advanced, their ends will just come into contact smith the adhesive film 11 on the carrier band 11 and the bands 13 will extend brick at an acute angle to the carrier band, up into the deflecting means 1211. The cutting means 18 at each deposition station comprises a plunger which is actuated by a suitable means, such as a cylinder or solenoid, after the band has been advanced through the deflecting means as above described, to press down on the portion of the band 13 which projects out of the deflecting means 1211. The downrrard movement of the plunger against the projecting portion will cause the projecting portion either to snap off or to sheared off from the band itself and to be set dorm onto the adhesive film 11 on the carrier band.In an exemplary embodiment of the apparatus, five supply reels 12 are provided so that in each case five strip sections or elements 13 are produced which are combined simultaneously with the self adhesive carrier band 11 during the feed pauses of the fixed cycle operating feed unit 121. In a preferred form of the invention there are provided a number of depositing stations equal to the number of strip sections or elements 13 to be deposited on one security strip. For example, the arrangement shown in Figure 1 would usually be used to produce security strips haviny five strip sections or elements 13 .It is also preferred to arrange the deposition stations so that they are spaced apart from each other by a distance equal to N 1 N or N 1 N times the length of the stroke of the feed unit 12 . Thus, where the feed unit advances the carrier band by the length of one security strip and the security strip is provided with five strip sections or elements 13 , the depositing stations should be spaced apart by 4 5 or 6 5 times the length of the security strip.With this arrangement, each depositing station will sinultaneously deposit a strip section or element 13 on a portion of the carrier band 11 associated with a different security strip and, as to each different security strip, the respective depositing stations each deposit their respective strip sections or elements 13 at a different location along the security strip. In this way the depositing stations are kept far enough apart so that the strip sections or elements 13 being deposited simultaneously from adjacent stations will not shift toward or away from each other due to residual magnetism.After the hard magnetic strip sections on elements 13 have been deposited onto the carrier band 11, a series of perforations 21 Figure 2 an made along at least one lateral edge 20 of the carrier band 11 by means of a perforating device 100 arranged in advance of the feed unit 12 . Any standard perforating device capable of punching a series of equally spaced holes along the edge of a continuous strip may be used for this purpose.This series of perforations facilitates the further manufacture of the security strip and the later handling of the strip when it is secured to the products to be safeguarded preferably by means of portabel tools. In order to minimize any malfunctions which may occur as the carrier band 11 progresses, advantageously at least one buffer loop 101 is provided. With this, the tension of the carrier band 11 is adjustable by means of a deflecting roller 102 and by means of brakes 103, which respond to the tension of the band.The apparatus of Figure 1 may be adapted to apply a continuous strip of hard magnetic material to each security strip instead of several individual strip sections or elements. In such case, a continuous strip 13 of hard magnetic material is drawn off from a supply reel 12 and is combined in the region of deflecting rollers 104 with the remaining components of the security stripsIn order that the feed of hard magnetic material from the rolls 12 may be carried out accurately and without slippage at the drive rollers, suitable means are provided to drive the rolls 12. Conventional dancer roll arrangements shown schematically in Figure 1 with appropriate limit switches may be provided to control the roll drives. In addition, or alternatively, as also shown schematically, guide elements may be arranged just above the deflecting means 12 and controlled in unison to move reciprocally in a horizontal direction between the forward feed cycles of the bands 13. These guide elements engage the bands just above the deflecting means and their horizontal movement pulls a certain length of the bands from their respective supply rolls 12. When the guide elements move back to their original position there remains a certain amount of slack in the bands 13 between the supply rolls 12 and the deflecting means 12 . Thus the rolls which drive the bands through the deflecting means need only take up this slack and do not have to turn the supply rolls themselves.Both a continuous band 16 of a soft magnetic material and a continuous cover band 17 consisting of paper or plastic material are drawn off simultaneously and continuously from further supply reels 14 and .15 respectively by means of drive devices not shown and, after passing from the deflecting rollers 104, the bands 16 and 17 are superimposed and combined with the carrier band 11, which already carries the hard magnetic strip sections or elements 13 . In this manner the hard magnetic strip sections or elements 13 and the continuous, soft magnetic band 16 are enclosed between the self adhesive carrier band 11 and the cover band 17.The width of the cover band 17 exceeds the width of both the hard magnetic strip 13 and the band 16 of soft magnetic material so that both sides its salient peripheral areas come into contact with the adhesive film 11 on the carrier band 11. Contra rotating rollers 105 press the various layers 11, 13 16, 17 of the security strips 200 togehter so that intimate union between carrier band 11 and the cover band 17 is produced, and the intermediate strip sections or elements 13 of hard magnetic material and the continuous band 16 of soft magnetic material are fixed immovably in their pOSition. At least one of the rollers 105 is driven by a self contained drive 106 which in turn is controlled by way of limit switches not shown actuated Thj up and down movement Or the dancer roll 102 arranged between the feed unit 12 and the defecting rolls 104. The thus combined layers 11, 11 , 13 or 13 , 1G and 17 together form a continuous strip assembly 200 which can be separated into individual security strips.In order to assure a high degree of reliabIlity and quality for the security strip assembly 200, there is advantageously provided a checking device 107 arranged directly after the supply reel 14, through which the soft magnetic continuous band 16 is passed and checked for determined, prescribed magnetic paraneters.The checking device 107 in turn is provided with suitable limit switches ihich, in the event of deviation from the prescribed parameters, stop the device in order to halt for the time being the further manufacture of tfic security strip assenbly 200. Stopping is also Indicated by an optical or acoustic signal.The manufactured security strip assembly 200 is finally wound onto a take up reel 10f3. Firstly, however, they pass through a demagnetizing device 109 which removes certain magnetization caused, for example, by the manufacture of the security strip assembly 200. The damagnetizing device 109 may consist of a coil through which an alternating current flows and through tjhich the security strip assembly 200 is passed.In order to be able to separate the security strip assembly 200 easily into individual security strips which can be applied to products to be narked it has been found advantageous to provide weakened zones 31 and notches 30 for automatic labelling, such as shown in Figure 3 and in Figure 4, which are equally spaced in such a way that at least the cover band 17 is severed and the soft magnetic strip 16 is also severed. The weakened zones are made in those areas wherein there are spaces between the successively spaced hard magnetic strip sections 13. In order to produce the weakened zones 31 and the notches 30, a rotating blade 110 is advantageously provided under which the manufactured strip assembly 200 is passed before entering the demagnetizing device 109.The strip assembly 200 is advantageously advanced by spiked rollers 111 whose spikes engage the perforations 21 arranged in the carrier band 11. Switchable means not shown are provided to synchronize the feed of the security strip assembly 200 and the rotation of the rotating blade 110 in such a way that the weakened zones 31 are made at equal intervals in the longitudinal direction of the security strip assembly 200. The distance between the weakened zones 31 determined the length of the security label later to be attached to the product to be safeguarded.As shown in Figure 4, a security strip 440 which is particularly advantageous from a practical standpoint contains printing which is preferably applied to the outer surface of the cover band 17. This printing may include information relating to the type and price group of the article to be safeguarded by the security strip. This information can be applied in intelligible script and or in the bar code appropriate for automatic identification, which is prevalent today. A security strip which is equipped in such manner simultaneously fulfills several functions. On the one hand, it sefeguards the article against unauthorized removal and thereby reduces losses caused through shoplifting. On the other hand, in the cashpoint area, or even for stock taking, it allows extensive, automatic recording of prices and or stock. Tile security strip allows particularly rational development of the selling process, as, in suitably equipped casilpoint areas for issuing receipts, tile type and price of an article can be determined and a deactivating process can be carried out essentially simultaneously. The deactivating process removes the alarn triggering properties of the security strip after the purchase price has been truly paid, so that the honest customer can leave the security area unchallenged. The surface of the cover band 17 is printed, for example by a schenatically indicated conventional printer 112 which is arranged Immediately after the supply reel 15.
