# One piece electrical contact.

## Abstract
One piece socket or pin type electrical contact rolled from a sheet of resilient, electrically conductive material into a tubular body 3 having a center section 11 of enlarged diameter which functions as a C spring and is radially compressed to insert or remove the contact from either the front or rear of a bore in a cooperating connector. An annular groove 17 in the center section 11 engages a retention ring in said bore to lock the contact 1 in place and the center section 11 bears against the wall of the bore in the cooperating connector to stabilize the connection. The contact 1 may be provided with a self terminating wire well 23 having tines 25 and ribs 27 which cooperate to grip a stripped or unstripped wire which is first longitudinally pushed into and then pulled back toward the wire receiving end of the contact 1 .
