## Description
The present invention relates to a low modulus, low odor, one component, room temperature valucanizable silicone rubber composition suitable as a formed in place gasketing sealant. The composition is of low volatility as well as being non corrosive with regard to ferrous and aluminium substrates. Low modulus characteristics are desirable in silicone rubbers intended for sealant applications to accommodate joint movement due to vibration and thermal cycling. Less stress is then exerted on a sealant metal bond interface which decreases the probability of oil leaks. However, oil resistance has traditionally been improved by the use of comparatively high crosslink densities. This results in lower elongation properties and, hence, reduced movement capability. If lower modulus is achieved by incorporating fewer crosslinks into the elastomer, then the polymer backbone is subject to more rapid deterioration as a result of attack by nucleophilic or electrophilic agents at elevated temperatues. It has not generally been possible to achieve low modulus, high elongation silicone elastomers with good oil resistance. DE A 3212008 discloses a composition which comprises a diorganopolysiloxane containing condensable terminal end groups a silicon compound containing per molecule at least three amino groups attached to silicon by nitrogen or oxime groups attached to silicon by oxygen, or a total of at least three amino groups attached to silicon by nitrogen and oxime groups attached to silicon by oxygen and the reaction product of a silane containing per molecule at least two monofunctional hydrocarbon radicals attached to silicon by oxygen optionally interrupted by ether oxygen or an oligomer thereof, with a diorganotin diacylate. The compositions may also contain agents for improving adhesion and specific reference is made to organosilanes containing at least one amino group attached to silicon by carbon of the type described in US A 3678003 or US A 4191817. These documents relate essentially to silanes and siloxanes containing in the molecule an amino group bonded to silicon by an alkylene moiety optionally interrupted by an ether linkage and in which remaining valencies of the nitrogen atom are bonded to hydrogen or an alkylene moiety. Example 1 of DE A 3212008 and example 1b of US A 3678003 both disclose compositions comprising silanol terminated diorganosiloxane base polymer, oxime cross linking agent, an adhesion improving agent of the type referred to above an organo tin catalyst and a calcium carbonate filler. Although DE A 3212008, US A 3678003 and US A 4191817 all relate to providing room temperature vulcanisable silicone rubber compositions, they are not concerned specifically with the use of such compositions in applications where oil resistance is required and no mention is made of the problem of improving oil resistance. US A 3,189,576 relates to organosilicon intermediates containing silicon bonded oxime radicals. US A 3,837,878 relates to a process for treating silica filters by contacting the silica filler with a mixture of a hydroxyl amine, a cyclic siloxane and a silyl nitrogen compound. The end result is a silica filler having a large number of organo siloxy groups appended to it. US A 4,356,116 relates to a devolatilized room temperature vulcanizable silicone rubber composition comprising a silanol polymer, a plasticizing fluid, containing a combination of monofunctional, difunctional and trifunctional siloxy groups, a crosslinking agent, a curing promoter and, optionally, a filler. US A 4,395,526 relates to a stable, substantially acid free, one component curable polyalkoxy terminated organopolysiloxane composition including a condensation catalyst, such as a tin compound. The fillers include titanium dioxide, iron oxide, fumed silica, carbon black, calcium carbonate, quartz, and the like. However, none of these patents teach or suggest a low modulus silicone elastomer having good oil resistance and high elongation. Formed in place silicone gasketing has been utilized at the OEM level in the automotive industry since 1971 Handbook of Adhesives, Second Edition, Skeist, published by Van Nostrand, Reinhold Co. 1977 Chapter 39 by Beers . The first generation sealants used acetoxy curing systems, such as those disclosed in US A 3,035,016, US A 3,133,891 and US A 3,382,205. The next generation involved amine curing systems such as those disclosed in US A 3,032,528 and octoate curing systems as disclosed in US A 4,356,116 and US A 4,257,932. Recently, formed in place silicone gasketing systems have been reported using methoxysilicone vulcanization General Motors specification 9985530 . Chemical Abstracts, In as much as improved oil resistance has traditionally been achieved in silicone gasketing technology by operating at comparatively high crosslink densities US A 4,257,932 it was not to be expected that a silicone rubber composition could be obtained with a low modulus, high elongation and good oil resistance. The present invention provides such a silicone rubber composition which is suitable as a formed in place gasketing sealant. The composition has the further advantage of low odor. The silicone rubber composition according to the invention is a one component room temperature vulcanizable composition comprising a devolatilized silanol terminated diorganosiloxane polymer, and optionally a devolatilized trimethylsilyl terminated diorganopolysiloxane plasticizer. The composition is characterized in that it contains an oxime crosslinking agent together with a hydrophobic calcium carbonate filler. Thus the low modulus, one component, room temperature, vulcanizable silicone rubber composition according to the invention comprises The composition is characterised in that it contains as the crosslinking agent from 2 to 15 percent by weight based upon the total weight of the composition of an oxime of the formula The present invention also provides the use of The basic ingredient of the low modulus, high elongation, good oil resistance, room temperature vulcanizable RTV silicone composition of the present invention is a devolatilized silanol terminated diorganosiloxane polymer. This linear polymer can be devolatilized in any manner such as set forth in US A 4,356,116 and generally has a viscosity of from 2,000 to 250,000 mPas centipoise and preferably from 10,000 to 120,000 mPas centipoise . The polymer may be represented by the formula The plasticizer utilized along with the linear base polymer is a devolatilized triorganosiloxy terminated diorganopolysiloxane fluid which is present in an amount of 0 to 40 percent by weight for example 1 to 40 percent by weight and desirably from 5 to 25 percent by weight based upon the total composition. The plasticizer lowers the durometer and modulus of the cured rubber and, lowers the viscosity of the overall system or composition. However, the viscosity of the plasticizer should not be too low as it may tend to bleed out of the composition. Accordingly, the viscosity of the plasticizer generally ranges from 50 to 100,000 mPas centipoise and is preferably from 500 to 10,000 mPas centipoise . The plasticizer is a diorganopolysiloxane polymer terminated with monofunctional, triorganosiloxy end groups. The organo compounds within the repeating units are the same as R¹ and R² set forth above. However, it may contain trace quantities of trifunctional monoorganosiloxy units originating from impurities in the starting materials. The siloxy units may contain an alkyl group having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms with methyl being preferred. The number of repeating units in the plasticizer is generally from 20 to 900. As with the linear base polymer, the plasticizer is devolatilized in accordance with any conventional manner or process, well known to the art. A specific example of devolatilization is set forth in a US A 4,356,116. In order to reinforce the polymer network as well as to impart non sag to the system, a thixotropic agent may be added to the overall composition. This agent which also adds physical strength to the system desirably is a treated or an untreated silica filler with a treated fumed silica filler being preferred. Treated silica fillers generally have lower moisture content, and result in better low modulus properties. The amount of silica filler generally ranges from 1 to 20 percent by weight with from 3 to 8 percent by weight being preferred. Treated or untreated silica fillers are well known to the art and generally any such conventional fillers can be utilized. Examples of specific silica fillers are set forth in US A 3,837,878. Additionally, treated silicas as set forth in US A 2,938,009, US A 3,004,859, and US A 3,635,743 can be used. Typically, the silica filler has a very high surface area such as about 200 m² gram. Optionally, from 0.1 to 5 percent by weight and preferably from 0.2 to 3 percent by weight based upon the total weight of the overall composition of a thermal ageing additive can be included. This optional component is an additive which reduces oxidation and thermal rearrangement of polymers at elevated temperatures. Suitable additives include materials such as cerium neodecanoate, rare earth octoates and iron octoate. Representative samples also usually include pigments such as carbon black, iron oxide powder, titanium dioxide, aluminium powder, and the like. Naturally, any desired color can be utilized. According to the present invention an organo tin salt catalyst is used in association with the oxime crosslinking agent. The amount of the said catalyst is generally from 0.01 to 0.5 percent by weight and preferably from 0.02 to 0.2 percent by weight based upon the total weight of the composition. The tin catalyst is generally an organo tin compound well known to the art and as set forth in US A 4,356,116, and US A 4,395,526. Examples of specific tin compounds include dibutyltindilaurate, dibutyltindiacetate, tin octoate, dimethyl tin dibutyrate, triethyl tin tartrate, tin oleate, dibutyl tin oxide, and dimethyltinbis neodecanoate. An important aspect of the present invention is the use of specific oxime curing or crosslinking agents. It has been found that such agents readily accommodate the formulation of general low modulus properties and allow the overall system or composition to have high elongation as well as very good oil resistant properties. Low modulus characteristics are desirable in various applications of the present composition such as in gasketing applications since they allow for maximum joint movement without exposing the substrate sealant interface to high stresses which can lead to adhesive failure of the interface, thus resulting in oil leak paths. The low modulus behavior of the composition according to the invention thus ensures a good oil seal. This type of oxime curing agent is represented by the formula The amount of the oxime curing agent ranges from 2 to 15 percent by weight based on the total weight of the composition with 4 to 8 percent by weight being preferred. Preparation of the oxime curing agents defined above is generally well known to the art as set forth in US A 3,189,576. In order to ensure that gellation or viscosity increases do not occur, an excess of oxime crosslinking agents relative to the silanol groups in the base polymer is utilized as an equivalent ratio of from 1.2 to 4.0 with from 1.5 to 2.5 being preferred. Another important aspect of the present invention is the use of a hydrophobic calcium carbonate filler which imparts a desirable oil stabilizing effect as well as a low degree of reinforcement to the polymer to allow for the incorporation of low modulus properties. The amount of hydrophobic filler generally ranges from 5 to 60 percent by weight based on the total weight of the composition with from 15 to 45 percent by weight being preferred. It is important to the present invention that the water level of the hydrophobic filler be very low. Accordingly, if small amounts of filler are utilized, that is 15 percent by weight or less, the water level can range up to 0.4 percent by weight based upon the total weight of hydrophobic filler. Otherwise, the water content is 0.2 percent by weight or less with 0.1 percent by weight or less being preferred. According to test data, it appears that an important criterion of a suitable hydrophobic filler is that it be a treated ground or precipitated calcium carbonate. Accordingly, specific examples of suitable fillers include stearic acid treated ground calcium carbonate, stearic acid treated precipitated calcium carbonate, and calcium carbonate having the above noted low moisture contents. The general particle size is from 0.03 to 50 µm with 0.05 to 20 pm being the most desirable range. Generally, talc, silica and clay type materials are not suitable due to their high moisture content and lack of stabilization properties. In addition to the above set forth components, various other conventional compounds such as antioxidants, such as cerium neodecanoate, rare earth octoate and iron octoate, can be utilized in the composition of the present invention in conventional amounts such as 0.1 to 0.3 percent. The above described components result in a low modulus, low odor, one component RTV silicone rubber composition suitable as a formed in place gasketing sealant which is noncorrosive with regard to iron, steel and aluminium substrates. In addition, the composition of the present invention has a low modulus, high elongation and very good oil resistant properties. Moreover, the composition readily meets low silicone volatility requirements such as those of General Motors specification 9985443. In general, compositions of the present invention have a modulus value at 50 percent of 517 kPa 75 psi or less with 345 kPa 50 psi or less being preferred. The tensile strength at 75 percent modulus is 621 kPa 90 psi or less with 483 kPa 70 psi or less being preferred. At 100 percent modulus the value is usually 758 kPa 110 psi or less with 621 kPa 90 psi or less being preferred. With regard to the oil resistance, the percentage decrease in tensile strength after two weeks at 149 C 300 F in 5W30 engine fill oil is generally 40 percent or less with 30 percent or less being preferred. The compositions of the present invention are ideally suited as in place gasketing sealants in that they have good thermal resistance at high temperatures for example about 149 C to 260 C 300 F to 500 F and yet still maintain good flexibility at low temperatures for example to about 62 C 80 F . The particular area of usage is in various internal combustion engines and for various gaskets thereof such as oil pan, valve cover, engine side seal, water seal, intake seal, and the like. The compositions are generally prepared by charging the various ingredients into a mixer under dry conditions as through the use of dry nitrogen to prevent hydrolysis of the oxime crosslinking compound. Generally, the polymer is added first with the plasticizer. The oxime crosslinker compound is then added followed by the fumed silica, as well as any thermal stabilizing agent. The particular hydrophobic calcium carbonate filler is then added. The tin catalyst is added last in order to minimise any hydrolysis of the crosslinking agent during momentary exposure to atmospheric moisture. The composition is then generally mixed under high speed or agitation as well as under a vacuum for several minutes or even hours to remove the entrapped nitrogen bubbles. The resulting paste formed can be placed or extruded into a desirable container or the like. The invention will be better understood by reference to the following examples This composition was prepared by charging the ingredients into the mixing can of a vertical laboratory change can mixer which had been flushed with dry nitrogen to prevent hydrolysis of the oxime crosslinker. The ingredients were subsequently added in the following order 1 , 2 , 6 , 5 , 3 , 4 and 7 . The ingredients were then mixed at high speed under vacuum for approximately two hours and afterwards the resulting paste was transferred to a pressure Semco mixer. It was then extruded from the pressure Semco into 170 g six ounce polyethylene cartridges. ASTM sheets of the product were prepared and allowed to cure on exposure to atmospheric moisture for seven days and then tested in the manner described above. In another experiment 0.5 weight percent of an adhesion promoter was added to the composition of Example 1. The resultant one component RTV sealant was used to prepare peel adhesion specimens. After two weeks cure it yielded excellent adhesion properties on an aluminium substrate as indicated by the resulting cohesive failure of the specimens when they were pulled on an Instron tester. A basic screening formulation containing comparatively high viscosity 75,000 mPas cps silanol terminated polymer was utilized in evaluating the performance characteristics of various fillers. The high viscosity polymer was chosen because its elevated molecular weight imparts characteristically greater elongation properties and hence contributes to the low modulus behavior of the resulting sealant products. The composition of the test formulation was as follows The above compositions were prepared by charging the ingredients into vertical laboratory change can mixer under dry nitrogen to prevent the hydrolysis of the oxime crosslinker. The ingredients were added in the following order 1 , 2 , 5 , 3 , 4 , 7 and 6 . The composition was mixed at high agitator speed under dry nitrogen for one hour after the test filler 7 had been added. The dimethyltin bis neodecanoate was then added and mixed under vacuum for twenty minutes to remove the entrapped nitrogen. The following commercial grades of filler were examined OMYA F T stearic acid treated calcium carbonate , Albacar 5970 precipitation calcium carbonate , Imsil 54 ground quartz , white 1 ground calcium carbonate , Emtal 42 a talc , Armco 70 ground calcium carbonate and Huber 90A a clay . Both white 1 calcium carbonate and Huber 90A clay caused the RTV silicone to cure in the container due to high moisture contents. Both the Imsil 54 ground quartz and Emtal 42 talc yielded high modulus properties than desired for the high nolecular weight 75,000 mPas cps polymer and also lacked the oil stabilization effects imparted by their calcium carbonate counterparts. Both the initial room temperature physical properties and oil immersion characteristics are shown on Table I. Examination of the data in Table I shows the advantages of utilizing certain types of calcium carbonates. Note that the percentage loss of tensile strength after oil immersion is approximately one half that of compositions containing the other filler types. Weight loss studies revealed that the filler must usually contain less than 0.2 weight percent moisture to yield a stable composition. The White 1 calcium carbonate cured in the tube because it had a moisture content of approximately 0.5 percent, whereas the clay had a moisture content of approximately 0.7 percent. To further illustrate the influence of filler type and moisture level of the behavior of the final formed in place gasketing product, the following example is given. The filler utilized was a fine grade of stearic acid treated calcium carbonate known as Ultra Pflex and having an average particle size of 0.07 pm. The moisture content of the filler was approximately 0.4 WT. percent. The water was apparently occluded in the filler structure since it took several days for the sealant to vulcanize within the moisture proof tube. However, excellent low modulus properties were achieved with the comparatively low molecular weight 11,000 mPas cps , silanol terminated dimethylpolysiloxane polymer. One final example of the benefits to be derived from this technology is shown below. The composition has been designed to be of a medium modulus formed in place gasketing product. It aptly shows the superior oil resistance imparted by the technology described in this disclosure. Note the low thirteen percent loss in tensile strength in comparison with the forty to fifty percentage decrease normally observed in other systems see examples shown earlier . A summary of the physical characteristics of the calcium carbonates utilized is given in the table shown below From examining the above examples, it should be apparent that good physical properties such as low modulus values, and high elongation characteristics along with very good oil immersion properties were obtained. Thus, it should be apparent from the present invention that, although low modulus and high elongation values are obtained, the compositions of the present invention have very good oil resistance properties.
