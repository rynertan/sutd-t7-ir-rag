# SLAGGER TAR INJECTION

## Abstract
The thermal efficiency of fixed bed ash slagging coal gasifiers is improved by recycling by product organic liquids including tar, oils and phenols to the gasifier. By choosing a suitable point of injection above the raceway within the fuel bed complete gasification of by products is achieved, methane formation can be enhanced and thermal efficiency is increased. These benefits are obtained without significant ly increasing oxygen consumption.
