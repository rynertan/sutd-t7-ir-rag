# Process and apparatus for dewatering of rayon staple by squeezing rollers.

## Abstract
Viscose rayon filaments are cut by a cutter 12 into a staple S which is placed onto a conveyor 14 and passed to a liquid processing area 16 . The thus treated fibres then pass, after optional squeezing through rolls 18 , between one or more pairs of arcuate turning members 20 for causing the edges of the blanket of rayon fibres to turn in and fold over onto themselves, so that they can be effec tively compressed by additional pressure rolls 18 .
