The interrelationship of dosages for animals of various sizes and species and humans based on mg m2 of surface area is described by Freireich, E.J., et al., Quantitative Comparison of Toxicity of AnticancerAgents in Mouse, Rat, Hamster, Dog, Monkey and Man. CancerChemother.Rep., 50, No. 4, 219 244, May 1966. A preferred dosage regimen for optimum results would be from about 3 mg m2 day to about 200 mg m2 day, and such dosage units are employed that a total of from about 5 mg to about 360 mg of the active compound for a subject of about 70 kg of body weight are administered in a 24 hour period. This dosage regimen may be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. For example, several divided doses may be administered daily or the dose may be proportionally reduced as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. The active compound may be administered by the intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous routes. The active compounds may be administered parenterally or intraperitoneally. Solutions or dispersions of the active compound can be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant such as hydroxypropylcellulose.Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof and in oils.Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms. The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of micro organisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like , suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils.The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example sugars of sodium chloride.Prolonged absorption of the injectable cmpositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example aluminum monostearate and gelatin. Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the active compound in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the various sterilized active ingredients into a sterile vehicle which contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above.In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and the freeze drying technique which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile filtered solution thereof. As used herein, pharmaceutically acceptable carrier includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents and the like. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatable with the active ingredient, its use in the therapeutic compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active ingredients can also be incorporated into the compositions. It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for each of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the mammalian subjects to be treated each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharma ceutical carrier. The specification for the novel dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on a the unique characteristics of the active material and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and b the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active material for the treatment of disease in living subjects having a diseased condition in which bodily health is impaired as herein disclosed in detail. The principal active ingredient is compounded for convenient and effective administration in effective amounts with a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in dosage unit form as hereinbefore disclosed. A unit dosage form can, for example, contain the priricipal active compound in amounts ranging from about 2 mg to about 2 g, with from about 5 to about 360 mg being preferred. Expressed in proportions, the active compound is generally present in from about 2 to about 100 mg ml of carrier. In the case of compositions containing supplementary active ingredients, the dosages are determined by reference to the usual dose and manner of administration of the said ingredients. Regression and palliation of cancers are attained, for example, using intraperitoneal administration. A single intravenous dosage or repeated daily dosages can be administered. Daily dosages up to about 5 or 10 days are often sufficient. It is also possible to dispense one daily dosage or one dose on alternate or less frequent days. As can be seen from the dosage regimens, the amount of principal active ingredient administered is a sufficient amount to aid regression and palliation of the leukemia or the like, in the absence of excessive deleterious side effects of a cytotoxic nature to the hosts harboring the cancer. As used herein, cancer disease means blood malignancies such as leukemia, as well as other solid and non solid malignancies such as the melanocarcinomas, lung carcinomas, and mammary tumors.By regression and palliation is meant arresting or retarding the growth of the tumor or other manifestation of the disease compared to the course of the disease in the absence of treatment. This invention will be described in greater detail in conjunction with the following specific examples. EXAMPLE 1 N,N 5,8 Dihydroxyl,4 anthraquinonylene bis imino ethylene bis N 2 hydroxyethylacetamide 2,2 diacetate A mixture of 30.0 g of l,4 dihydroxy 5,8 bis 2 2 hydroxyethylamino ethyl amino anthraquinone dihydrochloride U.S. Patent 4,197,249 and 300 ml of methanol was chilled in an ice bath in a Dewar flask.
