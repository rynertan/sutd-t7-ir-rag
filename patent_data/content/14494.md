# Photographic imaging process and materials suitable therefor.

## Abstract
Novel photographic imaging process and materials suitable therefor are provided, which can find their application in multi colour motion picture and simultaneous sound recording, in direct positive image formation, in image intensification processes, etc. A photographic silver image is formed in at least one hydrophilic colloid layer of a light sensitive photographic material incorporating silver halide, by means of exposure and alkaline development steps, followed by bleaching of quantities of silver which are present in areas of said layer extraneous to those where imaging silver is required. A non diffusible silver bleach inhibitor is initially present in said layer or is released therein during processing of the material but before the bleaching step to prevent bleaching of the required imaging silver in said layer in the bleaching step and the prevention of the bleaching of the silver by the bleach inhibitor in the areas extraneous to those where imaging silver is required is counteracted by the presence in the corresponding areas of such layer of a bleach accelerator which is caused to diffuse into such areas from an adjacent hydrophilic colloid layer during the development processing of the material.
