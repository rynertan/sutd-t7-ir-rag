# Turbinedriven turbocompressor.

## Abstract
A turbinedriven turbocompresser is a multi stage machine composed of a number of uncoupled concentrical work wheels which within a common housing 1 between two stationary guiding blade wheels 2 and 3 are alternately counterrotating and which are equipped with blade rings that in the row of wheels form corresponding flow passages for respectively both expansion 8 9 and compression 10 11 . Flow directions for compression and expansion are opposite, stationary guiding blade wheels as well as rotating work wheels are constructed in the form of disks. The rotating wheels 4 and 6 are identical. Because of the low angular speeds of the rotating wheeldisks grease filled spiral groove bearings as well as gaslubricated bearings can be applied.

## Description
A turbinedriven turbocompresser for a directly fired heat pump, as well as for jet engines, and similar machines.The invention relates to a turbinedriven turbocomprsser for a directly fired heat pump, as well as for application in jet engines, turbochargers and similar machines.The performance of turbochargers, gasturbines, jet engines and, above all, directly fired turbocompression heat pumps is closely bound up with the energy efficiencies within the turbinedriven turbocompressers applied.In comparison with corresponding reciprocating machinery the above mentioned turbomachinss have many practical advantages, such as long life span with little maintenance, practically vibrationfree running, simple construction and small dimensions.In addition energy efficiencies in turbomachines prove to be very high, at least with large machine power. With smaller machine power efficiencies decrease substantially.The overall efficiencies of turbinedriven turbocompressers of very small power for application in directly fired heat pumps for central heating of individual houses such as nowadays under development, range from moderate to poor. The narrow flowpassages in the machines give rise to unusually large flow losses, while also the parasitic leakage and disk friction losses become abnormally large as a result of the very small machine dimension many a turbinedriven turbocompresser of small power is composed of a single centrifugal impeller for compression on one shaft with a single or two stage turbinswheel. In these machines an attempt has been made to limit flow losses by establishing the relatively wide flow passages that go with extremely high angular speeds.Another well tried method for improving the efficiencies of small turbinedriven turbocompressers consists of the miniaturisation of existing large multi stage machines, such as axial gasturbines on one single shaft as well as two shaft radial Ljungstram turbines. The above mentioned extremely high angular spesd of small singlestage turbinedriven turbocompressers causes large problems with gas lubricated bearings, and severe sealing problems. As a result of manufacturing problems the miniaturisation of large adlti staga turbomachines leads to coarse blade shapes, with rather moderate flow efficiency.The invention aims at turbinedriven turbocompressers with very high overall efficiency down to very small machine power, at the same time avoiding very high angular speeds as well as coarse miniaturisation of flow blades. According to the invention this is achieved by regarding the work shaft, which in the usual turbinedriven turbocompresser connects the compresser with the turbine, as fundamentally superfluous. According to the invention a turbinedriven turbocompresser has then necessarily to be a multi stage machine composed of a number of uncoupled concentrical work wheels which within a common housing between two stationary guiding blade wheels are alternately counterrotating, and which are equipped with blade rings that in the row of wheels form corresponding flowpassages for respectively both expansion and compression.According to the invention the direction of flow through the blade rings for compression can be chosen opposite to that for expansion.In many practical cases this minimises leakage losses, even with relatively large clearances in the machine. The large clearances give rise to very small disk friction losses. The flow losses in a turbinedriven turbocompresser in accordance with the invention are to be compared to those in a Ljungstr√∂m turbine, in which likewise all rotating blades are to be considered guiding blades at the same time. The flow losses in these machines are fundamentally low. With a sufficiently large number of uncoupled rotating wheels in the turbinedriven turbocomprasser optimal blade geometry is arrived at flow efficiency is maximum. The overall efficiency of a turbinedriven turbocompresser according to the invention is to be compared to that of a hydrodynamic coupling, that is to say extremely high.The high overall efficiency of the turbinedriven turbocompresser in accordance with the invention is, as a result of the many degrees of freedom in the design of the machine, coupled with many other advantages. Guiding blade wheels as well as uncoupled rotating wheels can, according to the invention, be constructed in the form of disks, The large number of uncoupled rotating wheels can in that case consist of identical pairs only. These simple diskshaped wheels together with their identical bearing elements can easily be mass produced.Finally as a result of the low angular speeds of the rotating disks grease filled spiral grooue bearings as well as gas lubricated bearings can be applied, One way of carrying out the invention is described in detail below with reference to drawings which illustrate two specific embodi ments in which Figure 1 is a half section of a turbinedriven turbocompresser in accordance with the invention comprising a number of uncoupled rotating wheels between ringshaped gasbearings. Figure 2 shows corresponding blade shapes for compression and expansion. Figure 3 gives an enlarged detail of a ring shaped gasbearing. Figure 4 shows a disk shaped grease f illed bearing element. Together these figures give an idea of a turbinedriven turbocom presser according to the invention composed of a number of un coupled concentrical wnrk wheels 4,5,6 and 7 which within a common housing 1 between two stationary guiding blade wheels 2 and 3 are alternately counterrotating, and which are equipped with blade rrngs that irr ve row of wheels form corresponding flow passages for respectively both expansion 8 9 and compres sion 1u 11 . Flow directions for compression and expansion ars opposite. Stationary guiding blade wheels as well as rotating work wheels are constructed in the form of disks. The rotating wheels 4 and 6 are identical wheels 4 and 5 , and likewise 6 and 7 are anti symmetrical. The rotating wheeldiaks are gas lubricated between the bearing rings 12 which are centered in the housing 1 and locked up between the guiding blade wheels 2 and 3 .According to the invention it is also possible to lubricate the rotating wheels 4,5,6 and 7 centrally between the smooth symmetrical bearing disks 13 locked between the guiding blade wheels 2 and 3 and centered by means of the balls 14 . Each bearing element 13 contains two free rotating bearing rings 15 equipped with greasefilled spiral grooves on either side.
