# Paint roller assembly with improved sealing arrangement.

## Abstract
A paint roller assembly comprises a tube 12 with a roller rotatably mounted thereon. Paint is introduced into the interior of the roller via tube 12 and passes radially outwardly through passageways 35A G in the roller to a cover 77 . Leakage of paint between the tube 12 and the roller is inhibited by a sealing arrangement which comprises a diaphragm 59 fast with the roller and with a ring 58 rotatably mounted on tube 12 . A seal 57 is mounted on the flange 61 and is biased against a seal 54 abutting one side of a flange 32 fast with the tube 12 . Bias is provided by a spring 63 or a resilient spring bellows diaphragm 80 Figure 7 . The reaction force of the spring acts on the roller and biases a seal 50 on the roller against a seal 51 abutting the other side of the flange 32 .
