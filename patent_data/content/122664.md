# ALKALI EARTH METAL SALT ALKALI METAL SURFACTANT DRY MIX CAKES FOR LONGER LASTING DOSING DISPENSER

## Abstract
Solid cakes comprising a water soluble alkali earth metal salt and a selected alkali metal surfactant. The stoichiometric ration of the salt to surfactant ranges from about 0.1 1 to 2 1. Perfume, dye or salt, or any combination thereof can be added. The cakes have improved chemical stability and improved longevity. Preferred cakes are made with about 75 of a dry mix of magnesium sulfate and sodium alkyl sulfate having a stoichiometric ratio of 0.5 1, 18 perfume, 3 free fatty alcohol, and 2.7 dye.
