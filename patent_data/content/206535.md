## Description
Catalyst support This invention relates to a catalyst support and in particular to the support for the catalyst for use in the secondary steam reforming of hydrocarbons. In the production of hydrogen containing gas streams a hydrocarbon feedstock is often subjected to a primary steam reforming process wherein the feedstock and steam are contacted with a catalyst, typically nickel supported on a low silica support such as calcium aluminate cement, usually disposed in externally heated tubes. The primary reformed gas mixture is then often subjected to a secondary reforming step wherein the primary reformed gas is partially combusted with an oxygencontaining gas, e.g. oxygen itself or air where it is desired to introduce nitrogen into the gas stream, e.g. as in the manufacture of ammonia synthesis gas , and the combustion products are contacted with a secondary reforming catalyst. The catalyst inlet and outlet temperatures in the secondary reforming stage are generally considerably higher than in the primary reforming stage. Typically the secondary reforming catalyst inlet temperature is in the range 1050 to 1300or while the outlet temperature is typically in the range 900 to 10500C. The catalyst support employed in the secondary reforming stage has thus to withstand such high temperatures.Heretofore the conventional catalyst for secondary reforming has been nickel supported on rings formed from a calcium aluminate cement or alumina composition. In order to effect the desired reaction, the volume of the secondary reforming catalyst bed has heretofore been relatively large, typically 30 m or more in a plant producing 1000 te day of ammonia.Expressed in other terms, the volume of the secondary reforming catalyst bed has been of the order of 1.5 to 3 m3 per te.mol hr of gas leaving the secondary reformer. Such large volume catalyst beds have of course necessitated large vessels with consequent high cost of fabrication, particularly where, as is often the case, operation at presures significantly above atmospheric is required. In the present invention, by the use of a particular secondary reforming catalyst support, it is possible to reduce considerably the volume of the secondary reforming catalyst bed, and hence the size of the vessel required for secondary reforming. Indeed in the present invention the secondary reforming bed volume is typically less than one tenth of the volume employed with a conventional support. As will be explained hereinafter this reduction in the catalyst bed volume has additional advantages in a preferred form of the invention. Accordingly the present invention provides a hydrocarbon secondary steam reforming process wherein a primary reformed hydrocarbon gas stream, containing steam, is partially combusted with an oxygen containing gas and the combustion products are contacted with a metallic catalyst on a support, characterised in that said support comprises a single unit, or an assembly of units, each unit comprising at least 95 by weight of alpha alumina, less than 0.2 by weight of silica, less than 0.5 by weight of alkali, and 0 to 5 by weight of at least one oxide selected from titania, zirconia, and rare earths, and having i a plurality of passages extending through the unit in the direction of the flow of said combustion products, there being, per cm2 of unit cross sectional area in the direction perpendicular to the flow of said combustion products, 15 to 40 passages, and ii an open area of 40 to 85 , said unit, or assembly of units, having a geometric surface area per volume occupied by said unit, or assembly of units, of 10 to 30 cml, and the volume occupied by said unit, or assembly of units, being 0.05 to 0.4 m3 per te.mol hr of gas leaving the unit, or assembly of units. The, or each, unit preferably contains over 99.5 by weight of alpha alumina. The silica content should be below 0.2 by weight since silica is volatile in the steam containing gas stream at the temperatures employed and so any silica present will tend to be leached out and deposited in cooler parts of the plant. Such deposited silica is liable to cause blockages and or form a coating on subsequent catalytic beds thereby preventing full access of reactants thereto. Titania and or zirconia, if present, may be present as sintering aids, while rare earths may be present as stabilisers. The unit or units preferably have the following micromeritic properties BET Surface area 0.1 to 2.0, especially about 0.2, m2 g Helium density over 3.8, especially 4.0, g cm3 Mercury density 1.5 to 4.0, especially 1.9 to 2.0, e.g. 1.96, g cm3 Pore volume 0 to 0.4, especially 0.2 to 0.3, e.g. 0.2, cm3 g Pore radius over 10000, e.g. 17000, A. The unit, or assembly of units, preferably has an overall circular cross section having a diameter of over 1.5, especially 7 to 200, cm. The unit, or units, each preferably have a depth of 5 to 30 cm. The, or each, unit is of a monolithic configuration having a plurality of passages extending through the unit in the direction parallel to the direction of flow of the combustion products. The monolith has an open area of 40 to 85, especially 50 to 60, and the passages are of such size that there are 15 to 40 passages per cm2 of unit cross section in the direction perpendicular to the flow of the combustion products. The passages may have a triangular, square, rectangular, hexagonal, or curved, e.g. circular, cross section. The thickness of the walls between adjacent passages is preferably 0.03 to 0.08 cm. The geometric surface area per volume occupied by the unit, or assembly of units, is 10 to 30, preferably at least 15, cml, The secondary reformer may contain a single unit bearing the active catalyst or an assembly of a plurality of such units. Such an assembly may be composed of a plurality of units, each having a poygonal, e.g. hexagonal or square, cross section supported side by side. If desired the secondary reformer catalyst bed may comprise more than one layer, each layer comprising a single unit or an assembly of units as aforesaid. The support can be made by known methods such as oxidising a corresponding metallic aluminium structure or applying an alumina precursor to a fugitive carrier such as paper or extruding a composition comprising alumina and a polymer. In each case a calcination stage usually follows shaping in order to produce a support having the desired micromeritic properties. A suitable extrusion method is described in our EP A 134138. The secondary reforming catalyst supported on the aforementioned support structure will normally be a metal fromGroup VIII of the Periodic Table, and is especially nickel and or cobalt and or a platinum group metal, especially rhodium. Where the metal is nickel and or cobalt, the amount thereof is preferably 2 to 22 by weight calculated as the oxide. Where the metal is a platinum group metal, the amount thereof is preferably 0.05 to 5 by weight calculated as metal. In order to obtain a satisfactory loading of the catalytic metal, the support may be given one or more coats of a porous support material such as alumina of BET surface area 15 to 200 m2 g prior to incorporation of the active metal or a compound convertible thereto. In convention plants the volume occupied by the secondary reforming catalyst is usually within the range 50 to 200 , and typically about 80 to 120 , of the volume occupied by the primary reforming catalyst, i.e. the total of the volumes of the catalyst filled spaces within the primary reformer. As indicated above, in the present invention, the volume occupied by the secondary reforming catalyst unit, or assembly of units, is much smaller than in conventional plants and is typically between 3 and 40, particularly 5 to 25, of the volume occupied by the primary reforming catalyst. In the hydrocarbon secondary steam reforming step, the primary reformed gas, containing steam, is reacted with an oxygen containing gas such as oxygen, air, or oxygen enriched, or oxygen depleted, air. The primary reformed gas stream will normally consist of carbon oxides, hydrogen, steam, and methane. The proportions of these constituents will normally depend on the conditions employed in the primary reforming stage. The methane content will normally be within the range 8 to 30 by volume. In some cases it may be desirable to add an additional amount of the hydrocarbon feedstock and or steam to the primary reformed gas stream before the latter is fed to the secondary reformer.In the secondary reformer, the primary reformed gas containing feed is mixed, normally at a burner, with the oxygen containing gas, and partial combustion takes place, normally giving a flame the combustion products are then fed to the secondary reforming catalyst as described above. The secondary reforming conditions are normally selected so as to give a secondary reformed gas containing 0.1 to 2t by volume of methane dry basis .Typical secondary reforming conditions are as follows Catalyst inlet temperature 1050 to 1300, especially 1100 to 1250, OC Catalyst outlet temperature 900 to 10500C Pressure 25 to 50 bar abs. Outlet flow rate 10 to 15 te.mol hr Outlet steam content 15 to 50 by volume Where the process is used to produce ammonia synthesis gas, the amount of oxygen containing gas, which is normally air, oxygen enriched air, or oxygen depleted air, may be controlled so as to give an approximately stoichiometric ammonia synthesis gas wherein the ratio of the sum of the molar flow rates of hydrogen and carbon monoxide to the molar flow rate of nitrogen in the outlet gas is in the range 2.5 to 3.1 or a hydrogen deficient gas wherein that ratio is for example in the range 1.25 to 2.5, especially 1.4 to 2.1.In order to convert the secondary reformed gas into ammonia synthesis gas, the secondary reformed gas is normally subjected to the shift reaction, in one or more stages, and then carbon oxides are removed. Where the secondary ref ormer outlet gas is hydrogen deficient as aforsaid, carbon oxides and the excess of nitrogen may be removed by a pressure swing adsorption process as described in our EP A 157480, followed by methanation if necessary. The use of the high purity alumina support has the advantage of very low migration of alkali and silica even at high operating temperatures and this leads to an increase in the catalyst life. Also the use of the catalyst in the form of active metal, particularly where the latter is rhodium or platinum, supported on a monolithic structure has the advantage that not only is the volume of the catalyst bed required relatively small, but also that a more complete approach to equilibrium with reduced pressure drop can be achieved. The approach to equilibrium is typically 1.20C in contrast to an approach of about 50C when using a conventional secondary reforming catalyst. As mentioned above the primary reforming stage is normally conducted by passing a mixture of the hydrocarbon feedstock which normally has an atmospheric pressure boiling point below 2200C and is preferably natural gas or naphtha through tubes containing the primary reforming catalyst while the tubes are heated from an external source. Often the tubes are heated in a directly fired furnace but it has been proposed, for example in USP 3442613, to provide the heat required for primary reforming from the outlet gas from the secondary reformer. An example of a suitable primary reformer which can be heated by the secondary reformer outlet gas is described in our pending European patent application 86301123.5 which corresponds to Andrew et al US Serial No. not yet known filed 24 February 1986 entitled Steam reforming hydrocarbons and bearing the identification No. B 33397. With this type of primary reforming where the heat required for primary reforming is supplied by the heat in the outlet gas from the secondary reformer, the present invention is particularly advantageous. Thus, with the conventional type of secondary reforming catalyst, the secondary reforming catalyst support has a relatively large mass compared to the supports of the present invention and so, in use, carries a large amount of heat Should it be necessary to shut the plant down in the event of a malfunction, or for routine maintenance, this heat carried by the secondary reforming catalyst support has to be dissipated.With conventional planets, where heat is recovered from the secondary ref ormer outlet gas by steam raising, there is no serious problem in dissipating this heat since continued passage of the hydrocarbon feed stock and steam, or steam alone, through the primary reformer, after shutting off the supply of heat to the primary reformer and the supply of oxygen containing gas to the secondary reformer, will rapidly sweep the heat carried by the secondary reforming catalyst support downstream where it can be absorbed by steam raising. However where the primary reformer is heated by the secondary reformer outlet gas, shutting off the supply of feed stock of the primary reformer will mean that the heat in the secondary reformer outlet gas is no longer used to provide the endothermic heat of reaction in the primary reformer.This has as a result the risk that the primary reformer will become overheated with the risk of serious damage thereto. Continuing the supply of hydrocarbon feedstock to the primary reformer so that the heat carried by the secondary reformer is absorbed by endothermic reforming in primary reformer while the secondary reformer cools can present hazards, e.g. where shut down is required as a result of a leak in the system and or may not be possible, e.g. where there is failure of the hydrocarbon feedstock supply. Using the secondary reforming catalyst support of the present invention has the advantage that far less heat is carried by the secondary reforming catalyst support and so can be dissipated into the primary reformer without risk of overheating the latter. The invention also provides a hydrocarbon steam reforming process wherein a hydrocarbon feed stock is primary reformed with steam by contact of the mixture of the feestock and steam with a primary reforming catalyst disposed in heated tubes and the resulting primary reformed gas, optionally with a further quantity of hydrocarbon feedstock, is then partially combusted with an oxygen containing gas and the resulting combustion products are fed over a secondary reforming catalyst as hereinbefore described, said primary reforming tubes being heated by the secondary reformed gas leaving the secondary reforming catalyst. The invention also provides apparatus comprising, in combination, a a plurality of tubes for containing a primary steam reforming catalyst b means to feed a hydrocarbon feedstock and steam to said tubes c a burner d means to feed an oxygen containing gas to the burner e means to feed gas from the outlet of said tubes to said burner f a supported secondary reforming catalyst downstream of said burner, said support comprising a single unit, or an assembly of units, each unit comprising at least 95 by weight of alpha alumina, less than 0.2 by weight of silica, less than 0.5 by weight of alkali, and 0 to 5 by weight of at least one oxide selected from titania, zirconia, and rare earths, and having i a plurality of passages extending though the unit in the direction of the flow of combustion products from said burner, there being, per cm2 of unit cross sectional area in the direction perpendicular to the flow of said combustion products, 15 to 40 passages, and ii an open area of 40 to 85 , said unit, or assembly of units, having a geometric surface area per volume occupied by said unit, or assembly of units, of 10 to 30 cm 1, and occupying a volume of 3 to 40 of the volume of the space within said tubes for containing said primary steam reforming catalyst and g means to feed secondary reformed gas leaving the secondary reforming catalyst past said tubes. In such a combination the primary reformer tubes, the burner, and secondary reforming catalyst may be within the same vessel as described, for example, in EP A 124226, but, preferably, they are in separate vessels, for example as described in the aforesaid European patent application 86301123.5 with insulating means to minimise the temperature difference of the primary reformed gas between leaving the catalyst containing regions of said primary reforming tubes and mixing with the oxygen containing gas at the burner. The invention is illustrated by reference to the accompanying drawings wherein Figure 1 is an isometric view of a honeycomb support unit, Figure 2 is an enlarged view of part of one end of the unit of Figure 1, Figure 3 is a diagramatic plan of part of an assembly of units of the type shown in Figures 1 and 2, Figure 4 is a diagramatic cross section of a primary reformer and secondary reformer incorporating a catalyst of the invention. In an example an alpha alumina composition was extruded by the process of EP A 134138 to give a honeycomb, having a regular hexagonal external configuration as shown inFigure 1, which was then dried and fired at 15000C for 4 hours. Fired honeycomb pieces, having a length of 20 cm and a distance across the hexagon flats of about 15.4 cm, had passages of equilatral triangular cross section configuration, as shown in Figure 2, extending through their length. The wall thickness between adjacent passages was 0.5 mm. The honeycomb had an open cross sectional area of 57.76D, a geometric surface area per unit volume of 14.36 cm 1 and 17.2 passages per cm2 of cross sectional area. Analysis showed that the fired honeycomb pieces contained over 99.6 by weight of alpha alumina, 0.12 by weight of silica, 0.04 by weight of iron oxide expressed asFe203 , and 0.04 by weight of sodium oxide. The units had the following micromeritic properties BET surface area 0.28 m2.g 1 Helium density 4.0 g.cm3 Mercury density 2.03 g.cm3 Pore volume 0.25 cm3.g Pore radius 17600 A The honeycomb support pieces were impregnated with rhodium by dipping in an aqueous solution of rhodium nitrate followed by drying and calcination for 4 hours at 4500C until the resultant catalyst contained 0.2X by weight of rhodium. Experimental measurement of the activity of the catalyst shows that the volume of the supported catalyst required for secondary reforming of a primary reformed gas, of the composition and under the conditions set out in the following table, is about 0.54 m3, arranged in an assembly of five layers la le as shown in Figure 4, each layer separated from an adjacent layer by 2.5 cm and, as shown in Figure 3, being composed of a number of the hexagonal units 2 packed side by side.EMI11.1 tb SEP I SEP Inlet SEP I SEP I SEP I tb SEP Primary SEP reformed SEP t SEP SEP Air SEP l SEP SEP Outlet tb SEP I SEP Gas SEP I SEP SEP I SEP SEP Gas tb SEP I SEP I SEP I tb Temperature SEP C SEP 1 SEP 715 SEP Ã­ SEP SEP 670 SEP 1 SEP SEP 972 tb Pressure SEP bar SEP abs.

The secondary reformer outlet gas is that required in an ammonia plant producing about 550 te. day of ammonia. In the arrangement of Figure 4, the primary reformer tubes 3 only one of which is shown in practice there will be a large number of such tubes have a closed end 4 and have an inner tube 5, extending from the closed end 4 through the length of the tube 3 and through a plenum chamber 6 above a tube plate 7 supporting the tube 3. Tube 5 carries a layer of insulation to minimised heat transfer from the gas within tube 5 into the annular space 8 between the outer wall of tube 5 and the inner wall of tube 3. The primary reforming catalyst is disposed in this annular space 8. In operation the primary reformer feedstock and steam is fed to plenum chamber 6 via line 9 and passes down the catalyst filled annular space 8 to the closed end of the tube 3. The primary reformed gas then passes up through tube 5 into a plenum chamber 10 at the top of tube 5 and then is fed, via line 11, to the burner 12 of the secondary reformer 13. Air is fed to the burner 12 via line 14 and the primary reformed gas is partially combusted, with the formation of a flame at the burner. The combustion products are then fed through the layers la le of the honeycomb units wherein secondary reforming takes place. The secondary reformed gas is then fed, via line 15, to the primary reformer where the hot, secondary reformed, gas flows up past the outer surface of tube 3 thereby heating it. The secondary reformed gas then leaves the primary reformer via line 16.
