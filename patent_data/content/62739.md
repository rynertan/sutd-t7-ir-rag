# Multielement magnetic head assembly and method of making such assembly.

## Abstract
A multielement magnetic head is formed with a closure section 30 having a nonmagnetic ceramic substrate 12 on which a thin layer of magnetic ferrite 20 is deposited and processed. The thin ferrite layer is cut to define the separate transducing elements 42 and data track separation. The closure section is joined to a wafer formed from a ferrite substrate 36 which carries thin film conductive coil means.
