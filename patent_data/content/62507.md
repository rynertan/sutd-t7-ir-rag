## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO COOKERS This invention relates to cookers and is more particularly concerned with heat reflectors therefor. It is known that a significant proportion of the heat emitted by a heating means for example, a radiant ring or a grill element of a cooker is directed away from food which is being heated. To recover some of this heat, a heat reflector may be mounted adjacent the heating means to reflect, towards the food, heat which would otherwise have been wasted. It is an object of the present invention to provide a cooker incorporating an improved form of heat reflector. According to the invention, there is provided a cooking apparatus including a heating means and a reflector located adjacent the heating means, characterised in that the reflector has a first surface facing towards the heating means, at least a major portion of said first surface being substantially planar, and a second surface facing away from the heating means, the second surface being such as to substantially inhibit transmission of heat generated by the heating means in a direction away from said means and from said second surface. In order to reflect a substantial amount of the heat, the said first surface may be highly polished. However, in the course of continued use, the surface may become soiled as, for example, by spillage or spattering of food on the surface and thus lose a substantial amount of its reflective quality, with the consequential reduction in utilisation of available heat.It may be possible in some cooking apparatus to remove the reflector and clean the surface, but this necessitates time and trouble, and, in any case, the surface may become scratched or damaged during cleaning and still lose some of its reflective quality. In accordance with present invention heat absorbed by the reflector is substantially inhibited from travelling away from the heating means and from the second surface immaterial of the properties of the first surface. It is desirable to mount the reflector as close as possible to the heating means, and it is preferable for the reflector to be so shaped as to facilitate such mounting. In one embodiment of the present invention the heating means may be a horizontal radiant ring and the reflector located below the ring to reflect heat upwardly towards an item being heated by the ring. Alternatively, the heating means may be a horizontal grill element and the reflector located above the element to reflect heat downwardly towards an item being heated by the element.The reflector is, preferably, an aluminium plate and the second surface may be polished to substantially inhibit the transmission of heat in said direction. The first surface may be reflective or not as to choice. In cooking apparatus, the addition of a flat, circular reflector plate can enable the same amount of cooking to be done as without the plate, but with a saving in energy of 10 . In fact the saving may be as high as 12 . Quite surprisingly in accordance with the present invention, it has been found that even where the first surface is matt and therefore substantially non reflective, the saving in energy is only reduced by about 2 . This is discussed more fully below. The present invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein Figure 1 shows a schematic sectional view of a reflector plate below a radiant ring of the cooking apparatus, Figures 2a and 2b show respective side and plan elevational views of one embodiment of the reflector plate, and Figure 3a and 3b show respectively a perspective view and a side elevation view from A of an alternative embodiment. Referring to the figure, a reflector 1 in the form of a circular plate is positioned immediately below a horizontal radiant ring 2, illustrated by four circles. In this embodiment both the upper and lower surfaces la, lb of the plate 1 are polished. In use of the cooking apparatus, a saucepan not shown , for example, may be rested directly on the ring 2 in order to heat its food contents. During cooking radiant heat energy is also transmitted downwardly to the surface la and, while this surface remains reflective, substantially all of the energy incident on the surface la is reflected back towards the ring.Rays 3 represent this effect. As long as surface la remains reflective, surface lb has a limited role. Surface la may reflect all but 10 of the energy incident upon it, the remainder of the energy largely being absorbed by the plate.The relector plate 1 will only allow about 1 of the energy incident on surface la to be transmitted from surface lb in a direction away from the ring 2 because surface lb substantially inhibits transmission of energy in this direction. If the surface la were substantially non reflective, or if the surface la becomes soiled and is rendered substantially non reflective, then nearly all of the heat radiation incident upon surface la is absorbed by the reflector plate 1. Surface lb now substantially inhibits all of this heat from being transmitted in said direction, and this heat is emitted generally towards the ring and saucepan as shown by arrowsThe plate therefore acts as a preferential black body radiator. Where it is desired to have the efficiency in cooking as uniform as possible throughout continued use, it may be desirable for the surface la to be made deliberately non reflective. Alternatively, where it is desired to obtain the best efficiency albeit with a slight deterioration with continued use, surface la may be reflective. Referring now to Figures 2a and 2b, in which like parts are labelled with like reference numerals with respect to Figure 1, the reflector plate 1 is of one piece construction and so dimensioned as to correspond to the diameter of the hot plate below which it is intended to be mounted. In this example the reflector plate is formed of aluminium sheet, although other suitable materials, stainless steel or tin, for example, could alternatively be used. The planar surfaces 1a and 1b of the plate may be polished to improve its reflectivity or alternatively the surface could be plated with chromium say or a sheet of reflective aluminium foil could be bonded thereto. The reflector plate of this example is circular and spans a diameter of about 150mm which corresponds to the diameter of a conventional hot plate, and is typically 1 to 2mm in thickness. Additionally, it has been found that the reflector should be as close to the ring as possible and in order to locate the reflector in its most advantageous position, an alternative embodiment to that shown in Figures 2a and 2b may be used.Such an embodiment is shown in Figures 3a and 3b wherein, a minor portion 7 of the plate may be depressed to a level lower than the major portion of the reflective area 8 of the plate to accommodate the legs of the ring which are coupled to the source of power supply, and which legs are typically disposed at a level below that occupied by the radiant ring itself. The reflector plate may be mounted against the underside of the spider used to support the hot plate of the cooker. Such mounting may be conveniently achieved using a threaded bolt mounted centrally to the spider, or another part of the oven, which fits through a central hole in the reflector plate and is held, locked in position by means of a suitable nut. It will be appreciated that other mounting means could alternatively be used a clamp ring engaging the reflector plate circumferentially, for example, or a pair of parallel grooved support ledges, extending in a plane parallel to, and below the hot plate, along which the reflector plate can be slid for use.
