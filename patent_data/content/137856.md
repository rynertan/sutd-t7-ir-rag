## Description
This invention relates to an image display method such as one where an image of an object to be depicted on the display screen of a CRT cathode ray tube is enlarged or reduced for full display of the object. Graphic display units are in use everywhere as means for implementing CAD CAM computer aided design and manufacturing . For example, a graphic display unit may be utilized effectively for checking an NC machining program by instantaneously displaying the tool trajectory of an NC machine tool or the like or the shape to be machined. When an image is to be displayed by a graphic display unit of this kind, it is desirable that the unit have a function for displaying the image on the CRT display screen in full following enlargement or reduction. With conventional methods, however, the image to be presented cannot be displayed in full on the display screen by means of a simple operation following enlargement or reduction. For instance, EP A 34506 shows an image display system where a given part of the screen can be enlarged to fill the whole screen, or the whole image reduced in scale so that the previous screen contents then fill only a given part of the screen. To display the complete image in full would necessitate either a trial and error step sequence or perhaps the reversal of previous reduction enlargement steps if one had started with the complete image. An object of the present invention is to provide an image display method whereby an image to be presented can be displayed in full on a display screen through a simple operation. According to the invention there is provided a method for displaying an image to be presented on a display screen on the basis of stored picture information including image starting point data, including the steps of In another aspect the invention provides an apparatus for displaying an image, comprising an operating panel for entry of horizontal and vertical dimensions L In embodiments of the present invention, therefore, an image to be presented can be displayed on a display screen in full following enlargement or reduction merely by entering the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the image and specifying the starting point on the display screen of the image to be depicted. The starting point may be specified in a simple manner by using a cursor, for instance. An embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to the drawings, in which Figs. 1 and 2 are schematic views for describing an image display method according to the present invention. In the Figures, DFS represents the CRT screen display screen of a graphic display unit, RP denotes the origin, having coordinates 0,0 , of an image to be presented, BRP designates the origin, having coordinates O Let us assume that the graphic image to be presented is to be displayed in full on the display screen DFS. According to this embodiment, this is carried out by enlarging or reducing the graphic image IMG by applying a suitable magnification, shifting the enlarged or reduced graphic image IMG by suitable amounts in the horizontal and vertical directions, and subjecting the picture information indicative of the graphic image to be displayed to transformation processing in such a manner that the enlarged or reduced graphic image IMG is made to fit the display screen DFS. In other words, according to the present example, an image to be presented is displayed in full on a display screen by a three step process. Specifically, a when the graphic image IMG which is to be displayed Fig. 1 has been enlarged or reduced reduced in the example of Fig. 1 by a predetermined magnification with the origin RP serving as a reference point, a magnification K is obtained so as to fit the reduced graphic image IMG indicated by the dotted line in Fig. 1 onto the display screen DFS, b shift quantities S and x ,y are used to generate a graphic. Fig. 3 is a flowchart of an image display method according to the present example, and Fig. 4 is a block diagram of a circuit for carrying out the image display method. If the picture information read out of the picture information memory 104 is a character code, the display controller 103 reads the character pattern indicated by the character code out of a character generator 115 and stores the pattern in a frame memory 116 for character pattern storage. Thereafter, a read controller 117 sequentially reads the stored information out of the frame memory 116 in synchronism with a timing signal produced by the timing signal generator 110. The combining circuit 112 combines this information with the signal read out of the frame memory 108 and applies the result to the intensity controller 113 to undergo intensity modulation. The methods of displaying the cursor are well known and will not be described in detail. Methods which are available, however, are a first method of reading a cursor pattern out of the character generator 115, storing the cursor pattern at a prescribed location of the frame memory 116 indicated by the cursor pointer 105, and reading out the stored information to display the same, a second method of generating a cursor pattern through a technique similar to that used for vector generation, and a third method of creating a cursor display area by using the contents X The foregoing description relates to a case where the image starting point DB on the CRT screen is designated by using a cursor. However, the present invention is not limited to such case, for an arrangement is permissible in which the image starting point DB is designated by using a light pen or keyboard. According to the present invention, an image to be presented can be displayed in full on a display screen in a simple manner merely by entering horizontal and vertical dimensions of the image and designating the starting point of the image on the display screen by, e.g., a cursor. The present invention is therefore useful for application to a display unit.
