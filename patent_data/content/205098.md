## Description
This invention relates to a novel influenza vaccine, in particular to an influenza vaccine consisting of artificial vesicle like particles of a complex of HANA antigen derived from influenza virus, known as the active component of the vaccine, and a muramyldipeptide derivative hereunder referred to as MDP derivatives known as synthetic adjuvant, the artificial particles being similar in size and shape to naturally occurring influenza virus particles. This invention also relates to a process for preparing such a novel vaccine. Since the vaccination effect of presently used influenza HA vaccines is subject to fluctuation by mutations which occur on HA hemagglutinin molecule of the prevailing virus, it is strongly desired to develop more effective vaccines than the conventional ones. One of recent approaches in influenza vaccine development is directed to a component vaccine consisted of HA and NA neuraminidase as main ingredients, i.e., influenza HANA vaccine. The resulting vaccine comprised of purified HA and NA is considered an ideal vaccine in terms of safety and effect and has already been put to practical use in England. Actually, however, the effect of the vaccine is still insufficient. On the other hand, another approach is directed to utilization of adjuvants. This work has resulted in the development of muramyldipeptide MDP and, through appropriate chemical modification, many kinds of MDP derivatives which exhibited improved immunopotentiation and were used as novel adjuvant materials. Regarding these MDP derivatives, it is, for example, reported by Kotani et. al., in YAKUGAKU ZASSHI 103 1 , 1 27, 1983 that 6 0 2 tetradecylhexadecanoyl MDP was administered to guinea pigs together with influenza vaccine i.e., HANA vaccine containing highly purified HA and NA as main ingredients, and that effective adjuvant effect was obtained. However, HANA vaccine obtained by simply adding these MDP derivatives into a vaccine as an adjuvant does not provide the vaccine with adequate effect. Accordingly, the primary object of the present invention is to provide a novel influenza vaccine having an improved immunogenicity compared with the conventional vaccine. Another object of the present invention is to provide a novel influenza vaccine comprising of artificial vesicle like particles of HANA antigen MDP derivative complex having nearly the same particle size and shape as the natural virus particles. These and other objects of the present invention will be clear from the following description. According to the present invention, there is provided an influenza vaccine comprising of artificial vesicle like particles of a complex of HANA antigen and at least one MDP derivative, where the MDP derivative forms a membrane of the particle corresponding to the lipid membrance of natural influenza virus particle on the surface of which there exists the HANA antigen being bonded to the MDP derivative so as to form the complex, which thus differs from the vaccine obtained by simply mixing a vaccine and an adjuvant. Thus, the artificial vesicle like particles of a complex of HANA antigen and MDP derivative obtained according to the present invention have nearly the same particle size and the same shape as the natural virus particles. The novel influenza vaccine can be prepared by the following special process. An influenza HANA antigen and an MDP derivative are firstly mixed in a weight ratio between 10 1 and 1 300 in a suitable buffer solution, for example, phosphate buffered saline, and then the resulting mixture is solubilized by adding an effective amount 0.1 10 w V of surface active agent thereto. Thereafter, the surface active agent is removed therefrom by dialysis to obtain a novel HANA antigen MDP derivative complex. In this connection, it is important to use a surface active agent which can be removed by dialysis. Examples of such surfactants include octylglucoside, sodium cholate and the like. Referring to Figs. 1 to 3, the HANA antigen MDP derivative complex thus obtained forms a so called virosome in which the MDP derivative per se enables formation of artificial vesicle like particles and HANA antigens are combined on the surface thereof through their narrow ends so that they have the same orientation as on the natural virus particles. According to another aspect of the present invention, there can be used MDP derivatives together with i cholesterol ii lecithin and dicetyl phosphate or iii a mixture of i and ii , etc., which promote the ability of MDP derivative artificial vesicle like particles to form. In this case, it is preferable to employ the following weight ratio MDP derivatives usable in the present invention include many kinds of appropriate chemical modifications of MDP. Such MDP derivatives are described, i.e., in Japanese Patent Public Disclosure KOKAI Nos. 52 46020, 52 156812, 54 73729, 54 130517, 55 19236, 55 28932, 55 28933, 56 18996, 56 49396 and 60 78997. It is preferable to use an MDP higher fatty ester having the following formula wherein Q represents a synthetic higher fatty acid residure having 20 to 60 of total carbon atoms It is more preferable to use 6 0 2 tetradecyl hexadecanoyl MDP referred as B30 MDP. These fatty esters are described in Japanese Patent Public Disclosure KOKAI No. 54 130517. It is also preferable to use the MDP derivative having the following formula wherein X represents an amino acid such as L alanine, L serine, L valine and glycine wherein R₁ is hydrogen atom, lower alkyl group, carboxamido group or carboxyl group n is 1 to 6 and A is a saturated or unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbone residue having 8 to 30 of carbon atoms with or without branches. More preferable example of such derivatives includes N Futhermore, it is preferable to use N The HANA antigen used in the present invention can be obtained by the steps of purifying influenza virus by high speed centrifugal separation or chemical treatment of allantoic fluid harvested from influenza virus infected eggs, solubilizing the purified virus with a nonionic surface active agent such as Triton x 100 and NP 40 or an anionic surface active agent such as sodium deoxycholate and sodium cholate, or a cationic surface active agent such as cetyl trimethyl ammonium, or decomposing the purified virus with an organic solvent such as ether, and then further purifying the resultant by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, affinity chromatography or the like. The present invention will be illustrated more concretely by referring to the following non limitative examples. Influenza A Bangkok 1 79 H₃N₂ virus was grown in embryonated hen s eggs and purified by subjecting the grown virus to high speed centrifugal separation 23,000 r.p.m., 90 minutes , low speed centrifugal separation 6,000 r.p.m., 60 minutes and sucrose density gradient centrifugation 30,000 r.p.m., 3 hours . There was then added Triton x 100 to the resulting virus solution in such amount that the final concentration of the Triton x 100 became 1 , the virus was solubilized by fully agitating it, after which purified HANA antigen solution was obtained by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Using the purified HANA antigen solution obtained above, four kinds of vaccine samples, the compositions of which are shown in Table 1, were prepared as follows. The respective ingredients were mixed and then octyl glucoside was added in such amount that the final concentration of the glucoside became 3 wt . After the ingredients were solubilized, dialysis into a phosphate buffered saline was conducted according to the conventional method. The HANA antigen concentration of each sample thus obtained was adjusted to 0.8 µg N mℓ and then inoculated at a dose of 0.5 mℓ mouse into the peritoneum of each of a group of 15 DDY mice 4 weeks old, DDY mice were also immunized with the aforesaid respective samples according to the same method as described above, and infected with virus of the strain used for preparing the vaccine 2 weeks later. The lungs of the mice were removed 4 days later. Plaque forming test by MDCK cell was conducted on the lungs to measure the amount of virus in the lung. The results obtained are shown in Table 1. As is obvious from the results shown in Table 1, all vaccines of the present invention have superior antibody forming ability to comparative examples consisting of only HANA. Observing the shapes of the vaccines of sample Nos. 1, 2 and 4 with an electron microscope, it was ascertained that the MDP derivative artificial vesicle like particles having the same size and the same shape as the natural influenza virus particles, on the surface of which the HANA antigens are bonded to the MDP derivative so as to form the complex were clearly formed as shown in Figs. 1 to 3. In order to determine whether the above prepared sample No. 1 forms a complex, the densities of the HANA antigen, whole virus and sample No. 1 were measured by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. As is obvious from the results shown in Fig. 4, sample No. 1 appeared as a band at a quite different position from the positions of HANA antigen and whole virus, so that sample No. 1 can be concluded to form a complex which differs from HANA antigen and whole virus. HANA antigen was prepared by the same method as set forth in example 1 except for using influenza A Philippine 2 82 H₃N₂ strain. The HANA antigen was mixed with the ingredients shown in Table 2, after which the mixture was subjected to a ultrasonic treatment for 8 minutes by Heat Systems W375 Sonicator equipped with a cup horn range 2.5 Heat System Ultrasonics., Inc. . The antibody forming ability of each sample thus obtained was measured by the same method as set forth in example 1. The results obtained are shown in Table 2, which show that the vaccines of the present invention have good antibody forming ability. As is obvious from the above examples 1 and 2, the influenza vaccine of the present invention has good immunogenicity and improved influenza infection protective properties.
