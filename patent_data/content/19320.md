# Arc spinner interrupter.

## Abstract
An arc spinner type interrupter has a stationary coil 101 coupled magnetically to a disk shaped arc runner 103 . A magnetic core 110 112 encases the coil 101 and has an annular gap 47 in Figure 7 extending across the upper exposed surface of the arc runner to permit access of an arc root to the arc runner 103 . The magnetic core material 110 112 has high permeability at currents lower than the rated interrupting current of the device and the magnetic material saturates at higher current levels. The effect of the relatively high permeability saturable magnetic core 110 112 is to increase the transient recovery characteristics of the interrupter at low currents without having to increase the number of turns of the coil 101 . The electrical coil 101 may be made of a spirally wound, relatively thin sheet of highly conductive material or can be made of a square conductor would in a coil form. The axial length of the coil is increased beyond that of prior art coils without substantially increasing the reluctance of the magnetic circuit. The electrical path arrows 130 from the coil 101 to the arc runner 103 includes parts of the magnetic circuit 110 112 .
