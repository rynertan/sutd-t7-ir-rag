# A toner powder and a method of forming fixed images by means of this toner powder.

## Abstract
Toner powder comprising thermoplastic polymer, col ouring material and possibly other additives, such as magnetically attractable material, the thermoplastic poymer bearing in its molecule one or more immiscible crystalline and amorphous blocks, the crystalline blocks forming the continuous phase in the polymer and having a melting point between 45 and 90 C, and the amorphous blocks having a Tg which is at least 10 C above the melting point of the crystalline blocks. A method of forming fixed images on an image receiving material, in which, using such a toner powder, a powder image is formed on a medium the surface of which consists of a material having less adhesion for the softened powder than has the image receiving material, the powder on this medium is softened by heating and the softened powder is brought into pressure contact with the image receiving material.
