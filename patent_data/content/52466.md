# Thermal sensor for detecting temperature distribution.

## Abstract
A thermal sensor for detecting temperature distribution in a deposited layer on the refractory walls of a blast furnace or the like, including a temperature probe assembly 1 having temperature sensing areas 3 at different points along the length thereof, an outer protective casing 5 for accommodat ing the probe assembly, a number of annular fin members 4 fitted on the temperature sensing areas of the probe assembly and secured to the outer protective casing, and an insulating material 7 filled between the outer protective casing and the probe assembly for thermally insulating the fin members from each other.
