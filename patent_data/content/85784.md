# Resinous flooring sheet.

## Abstract
A resinous flooring sheet is obtained by laminating successively on a light shielding resinous base sheet 1 , a transparent synthetic resin intermediate layer 2 , a light shielding ink pattern 3 and an overcoat transparent synthe tic resin layer 4 . This flooring sheet can impart abundant three dimensionai or visual depth impression through the optical path difference between the reflected light from the light shielding ink pattern 3 and the reflected light from the light shielding synthetic resinous base sheet 1 as well as through the shading of the light shielding pattern 3 pro jected through the transparent synthetic resin intermediate layer 2 on the light shielding synthetic resinous base sheet 1 .
