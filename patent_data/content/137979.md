## Description
This invention relates to novel diazine ethenylphenyl oxamic acids and esters and salts thereof, to methods of preparing these compounds, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them as active ingredients, and to methods of using them for the treatment of immunological, inflammatory and allergic disorders.Cromoglycate, normally administered as the sodium salt, is a potent and useful antiallergic, commonly prescribed for the treatment of bronchial asthma. Cromoglycate has for many years been accepted as an effective bronchodilator when given by inhalation as a solid. However, it is known to have certain disadvantages for instance, it is not active when given orally, which warrants a search for new orally active antiallergics. A number of oxamate derivatives have been disclosed in the patent and scientific literature. Illustrative of such prior art are the following a 4 Substituted thiazol 2 oxamic acids, U.S. Patent 4,238,496, and b N,N phenylene dioxamic acid and its derivatives, German Offenlegungsschrift 2,362,409.The prior art, however, does not disclose diazineethenylphenyl oxamic acids or their esters or salts. TITHE INVENTIONMore particularly, the present invention relates to novel diazine ethenylphenyl oxamic acidF represented by the formula EMI2.1 wherein R1 is hydrogen or alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms R2 is hydrogen, methyl, hydroxyl, alkoxy of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, di alkyl of 1 ot 2 carbon atoms amino alkoxy of 1 to 4 carbon atoms or HN CO CO OR1 A isEMI2.2 R3 is hydrogen, methyl, alkoxy of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, hydroxyl, amino, alkanoyloxy of 1 or 2 carbon atoms, di alkyl of 1 or 2 carbon atoms amino alkoxy of 1 to 4 carbon atoms or acetamido and R4 is hydrogen, amino, alkoxy of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, halogen or HN CO CO OR1 and, when R1 is hydrogen, non toxic, pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof, especially their alkali metal and primary or secondary amine salts.A preferred subgenus is constituted by those compounds of the formula I wherein R1 is hydrogen or ethyl, R2 is hydrogen, A isEMI3.1 R3 is hydrogen or methyl, and R4 is hydrogen or HN CO CO OR1, and non toxic, pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof.The compounds embraced by formula I may be prepared by reacting a 2 aminophenyl ethenyl diazine of the formulaEMI3.2 wherein A and R2 have the same meanings as in formula I, with an oxalate halide, preferably the chloride, or with a dialkyl oxalate, optionally followed by hydrolysis of the ester group.The reaction is preferably carriedsout by dissolving or suspending a compound of the formula II, or an acid addition salt thereof, in an inert liquid medium, and admixing the oxalic acid derivative slowly, preferably dropwise with the solution or suspension, Examples of suitable inert liquid media are benzene, toluene, xylene, methylene chloride, dimethylformamide or tetrahydrofuran. In addition, it is preferred to add an organic base, such as pyridine or triethylamine, to the reaction mixture to neutralize the acid released by the reaction. Since the reaction is strongly exothermic, the oxalic acid derivative should be added slowly and, if necessary, while cooling.Since most 2 aminophenyl ethyl diazines are sparsely soluble, it is of advantage to let the reaction mixture stand for an extended period of time, for instance overnight, with or without stirring, before isolating the reaction product.The reaction mixture is worked up in conventional manner, that is, by evaporating the inert liquid medium, extracting the residue with a suitable solvent or solvent mixture, such as ether, ethyl acetate, chloroform, hexane or mixtures of any two or more of these, purifying the extract solution, evaporating the solvent, and recrystallizing the residue. In some cases further purification by column chromatography is of advantage.If it is desired to obtain an end product of the formula I wherein R1 is hydrogen, the ester group is removed by hydrolysis with a basic or acid catalyst. Suitable such catalysts are strong bases such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, or mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid.The starting compounds of the formula II may be prepared by a 2 step process which comprises a Reaction of a nitrobenzaldehyde with a methyldiazine pyrimidine, pyrazine or pyridazine in a suitable solvent such as acetic anhydride, formic acid or the like to produce an intermediate 2 nitrophenyl ethenylldiazine, pursuant to the following reaction scheme EMI5.1 b Reduction of the 2 nitrophenyl ethenyl diazine to the corresponding amine with a metal or metal salt, such as iron, tin or zinc, in an aqueous acid according to A.J. Bechamp, Ann. Chim. Phys. 3 42, 186, 1854 . The preparation of some 2 nitrophenyl ethenyl diazine derivatives is described in the literature. For example, 4 2 p nitropyenyl ethenyl 2 amino pyrimidine EMI6.1 may be prepared according to the procedure disclosed in C.A. 62 10448 c Japanese Patent 19652, 1964 . Similarly, the compoundsEMI6.2 andEMI6.3 may be prepared by the general procedures described in J. Med. Chew. 1290 1970 , J. Chem. Soc. C 1343 1967 andJ. Pharm. Soc.

More particularly, they exhibit immunological, anti inflammatory and anti allergic activities in warmblooded animals such as rats, and are therefore useful for the treatment of allergic diseases such as allergic asthma, rhinitis, conJunctivitis, hay fever, urticaria, food allergies and the like.Representative compoundswof the present invention were tested comparatively with cromoglycate to determine in vivo anti allergic activity.The anti allergic properties were ascertained in rats by the Passive Cutaneous Anaphylaxis test PCA essentially as described by Goose and Blair Immunology 16 749 760, 1969 . Rat serum was diluted so that the skin reactions with diameters between 10 and 15 mm in unsensitized rats were produced. The PCA test was performed in duplicate by injecting 0.1 ml of this antiserum dilution on each side of the shaved back of rats. Rats so treated were injected intravenously i.v. twenty four hours later with 0.02 mg ovalbumin in 0.5 ml of 1 Evans Blue solution within five minutes after intrevenous administration or 30 minutes after oral administration of the test compounds. Thirty minutes after the ovalbumin challenge the rats were killed byC02 asphyxiation, and the skin was reflected.The diameters, in millimeters, of the blued areas were measured and the mean diameter was determined. The circular area was calculated, and the mean area in square millimeters of the control group was considered as 100 , and the results of the compound test groups were expressed as a percentage change from these control values. From dose response curves the dose reducing the size of the blued area by 50 EDso was estimated.The following table shows the results of this test for a few representative specific compounds of the present invention Compound of ED 50Example No. Nomenclature mg kg, p.o.

Preferably, the compositions are in unit dosage form, or in a form in which the patient can administer to himself a single dose. When the composition is in the form of a tablet, powder or lozenge, any pharmaceutical carrier suitable for formulating solid compositions may be used. Examples of such carriers are various starches, lactose, glucose, sucrose, cellulose, dicalcium phosphate, and chalk. The composition may also be in the form of an ingestible capsule for example of gelatin containing the compound or in the form of a syrup, a liquid solution or a suspension.Suitable liquid pharmaceutical carriers include ethyl alcohol, glycerin, saline, water, propylene glycol or sorbitol solution, which may be compounded with flavoring or coloring agents to form syrups.The compounds of this invention may also be administered by other than the oral route. In accordance with routine pharmaceutical procedure, the compositions may be formulated, for example, for rectal administration as a suppository or for presentation in an injectable form in an aqueous or non aqueous solution, suspension or emulsion in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid, such as sterile, pyrogen free water of a parenterally acceptable oil or a mixture of liquids, which may contain bacteriostatic agents, antioxidants, preservatives, buffers, or other solutes to render the solution isotonic with the blood, thickening agents, suspending agents or other pharmaceutically acceptable additives.Such forms will be presented in unit dose forms such as ampules or disposable injection devices or in multi dose vials such as a bottle from which the appropriate dose may be withdrawn, or in solid form or concentrate which can be used to prepare an injectable formulation.Compounds of this invention may also be suitably presented for administration to the respiratory tract as an aerosol or solution for a nebulizer, or as a microfine powder for insufflation, alone or in combination with an inert carrier such as lactose. In such a case the particles of active compounds suitably have diameters of less than 20 microns, preferably less than 10 microns. Where appropriate, small amounts of other anti allergics, anti asthmatics and bronchodilators, for example, sympathomimetic amines such as isoprenaline, isoetharine, metaproterenol, salbutamol, phenylephrine, fenoterol and ephedrine xanthine derivatives such as theophylline and aminophylline corticosteroids such as prednisolone and adrenal stimulants such as ACTH may be included.Compounds of this invention may also be presented as an ointment, cream, lotion, gel, aerosol or solution for topical application to the skin, nose, or eye.In any of the foregoing formulations, a suitable dosage unit may contain from 1 to 500 mg of active ingredient.The effective dose of compounds of this invention depends on the particular compound employed, the condition of the patient and on the frequency and route of administration, but in general it is in the range of from 0.01 mg kg to 100 mg kg body weight. As is common practice, the compositions will usually be accompanied by written or printed directions for use n the medical treatment concerned, in this case as an anti allergic agent for the prophylaxis and treatment of for example, asthma, hay fever, rhinitis or allergic eczema.For the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions, the compounds of general formula I are mixed in the usual way with appropriate pharmaceutical carrier substances and aroma, flavoring and coloring materials and formed, for example, into tablets or capsules or, with the addition of appropriate adjuvants, suspended or dissolved in water or in an oil, for example corn oil.The compounds of this invention can be administered orally and parenterally in liquid or solid form. As injection medium, it is preferred to use water which contains the stabilizing agents, solubilizing agents and or buffers conventionally used for injection solutions. Additives of this type include, for example, tartrate, citrate and acetate buffers, ethanol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, complex formers such as EDTA , antioxidants such as sodium bisulfate, sodium metabisulfate or ascorbic acid , high molecular weight polymers such as liquid polyethylene oxides for viscosity regulation, and polyethylene derivatives of sorbitol anhydrides.Preservatives may also be added, if necessary, such as benzoic acid, methylene propylparaben, benzalkonium chloride or other quaternary ammonium compounds.Solid carrier materials which can be used include, for example, starch, lactose,mannitol, methyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, talcum, pyrogenic silica, dicalcium phosphate, and high molecular weight polymers such as polyethylene glycol .Compositions suitable for oral administration can, if desired, contain flavoring and or sweetening agents. For topical administration, the compounds of the present invention can also be used in the form of powders or ointments, for which purpose they are mixed with, for example, powdered, physiologically compatible diluents or conventional ointment bases.
