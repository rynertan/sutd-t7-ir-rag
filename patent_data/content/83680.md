# Wavesoldering of chips.

## Abstract
Wave soldering apparatus particularly adapted for sol dering printed circuit boards which have closely packed chip components adhesively mounted on one side of the boards is described. A novel nozzle assembly is dimensioned to be mounted to the solder supply conduit of a conventional wave soidering reservoir. The nozzle assembly comprises a first nozzle which delivers a turbulent jet to the undersides of the printed circuit boards as they are conveyed over the nozzle assembly, and a second nozzle which delivers a smooth laminar wave through which the undersides of the printed circuit boards immediately subsequently pass. The turbulent jet forces solder into the restricted spaces at which chip component contact pads are located and the smooth wave completes this soldering action by building of additional solder in a manner which discourages the formation of solder icicles and bridging.
