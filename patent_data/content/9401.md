# Photovoltaic cells employing a zinc phosphide absorber generator.

## Abstract
A photovoltaic cell of the Schottky barrier type, hetero junction type of homojunction type. In order to reduce the cost of such a cell and increase its energy conversion efficiency and stability, the material used for the absorber generator 10 of the cell is zinc phosphide formed as a slice of a single or multiple crystal or as a polycrystalline thin film. In this respect, the zinc phosphide may be pure or be a related material containing zinc phosphide in which the characteristics of the zinc phosphide predominate, such as in a mixed crystalline structure of zinc cadmium phosphide.
