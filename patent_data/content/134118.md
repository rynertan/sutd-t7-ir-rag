# A MEMBRANE PROCESS FOR CONVERTING SODIUM SULFATE INTO SULFURIC ACID AND SODIUM CARBONATE

## Abstract
A system for converting sodium sulfate ore into chemicals of which H₂SO₄ and Na₂CO₃ are examples, utilizing a mem brane process, the basic electrodialysis cell of which is located, usutally as a series of such cells, between cathode and anode compartments. Each cell constitutes a pair of cation permse lective membranes between which a bi polar membrane is dis posed in spaced relationship thereto with the cation permselec tive face thereof confronting the cation permselective mem brane and the anion permselective face thereof facing the other cation permselective membrane. The cation permselective membranes of adjacent cells are common to such adjacent cells. All of the cation permselective faces of the bi polar mem branes face the cathode electrode and all of the anion permse lective faces of the bi polar membranes face the anode elec trode. Each cell includes a base zone and an acid zone. Each acid zone is defined by a cation permselective membrane and the confronting cation permselective face of the bi polar mem brane and each base zone is defined by a cation permselective membrane and the confronting anion permselective face of the same bi polar membrane. The acid zone is fed by a water solu tion of a sodium salt, for example Na₂SO₄ and Na₂S and the base zone is fed by a saturated water solution of NaHCO₃ or by a water solution of a mixture of NaHCO₃ and Na₂CO₃ or by a mixture of a water solution of Na₂CO₃ and CO₂ which reacts with the Na₂CO₃ to form NaHCO₃. The feeding of these com posite solutions to the different zones results in increased cur rent efficiencies by removing free H ions from the acid zone and free OH ions from the base zone. The cathode and anode electrodes are disposed in respective compartments through which water solutions of NaOH circulate. The cell is part of a plant in which other treatments are performed.
