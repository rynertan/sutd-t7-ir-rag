# 5,2 ,3 ,4 ,4 ,6 Hexadeoxykanamycin and its 1 N acylated derivative.

## Abstract
5,2 ,3 ,4 ,4 ,6 Hexadeoxykanamycin and 1 N S 4 amino 2 hydroxybutyryl 5,2 ,3 ,4 ,4 ,6 hexadeoxy kanamycin are now provided, which are each a new compound useful as antibacterial agent. The hexadeoxy kanamycin is semi synthetically produced from 3 ,4 dideoxykanamycin through consecutive steps which are ingeniously combined with each other to remove the 5 , 2 , 4 and 6 hydroxyl groups. The 1 N acylated hexadeoxyka namycin is produced by acylating the 1 amino group of hexadeoxykanamycin with S 4 amino 2 hydroxybutyric acid.
