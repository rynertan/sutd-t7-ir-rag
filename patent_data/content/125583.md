# Metered gas volume correcting arrangement.

## Abstract
Mechanism for continuously correcting volumetric flow indications of a gas meter for temperature and pressure vari ations is porvided with a pair of variable ratio transmissions 18, 78 which operably connect an input shaft 10 rotatable according to actual volumetric flow through the meter with an output shaft 112 that drives a counter 114 indicating gas consumption. Each transmission 18, 78 preferably includes an assembly in which there are a plurality of undi rectional clutches 24, 26, 28, 82 symmetrically arranged about a common axis, and a member 52, 76 relatively mov able with respect to such axis for changing the ratio of the transmission. A temperature responsive device 60, 62 con trols the ratio of one transmission in a manner resulting in a temperature corrected speed for such output shaft 112 . A pressure responsive device 90 controls the ratio of the other transmission 78 in a manner resulting in the applica tion of the pressure correction which is linearly dependent upon pressure to the output shaft 112 driving the counter 114 , either directly or through a ratio multiplying planetary gear train.
