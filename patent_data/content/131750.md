# Resonant flyback boost circuit.

## Abstract
A resonant flyback boost circuit 21 is used to enchance flyback performance by decreasing the time required for completing flyback on systems using a cathode ray tube and a magnetic deflection coil 11 . The boost circuit 21 is parallely connected across the yoke 11 in order to sense a voltage peak which occurs at the initiation of flyback. The voltage peak is used to initiate a control signal for allowing current to pass from a high voltage source 23 to a supplemental boost capa citor 33 . When the potential across the supplemental boost capacitor 33 exceeds the potential across the yoke 11 , curr ent flows from the supplemental boost capacitor 33 , to an isolating diode 40 to the yoke 11 , thereby increasing the current flow through the yoke 11 during the allocated flyback period. The boost circuit 21 reduces flyback time while main taining a high input impendance when boost is not being applied. The circuit 21 can be connected to as few as three points, does not require a separate sync pulse and has mini mal degrading effect on forward scanning and stroke writing modes of operation.
