# Endoscope apparatus.

## Abstract
In a camera 15 attached to the eyepiece section of an endoscope 1 is arranged a photoelectric element 14 for generating photoelectric signal corresponding to the brightness of light reflected from an object 70 and transmitted through an image guide 7 in the endoscope 1 . The photoelectric signal of the photoelectric element 14 is converted by a current voltage converter integrator circuit 28 to an observation light control signal at the time of observation while to photographing light control signal at the time of photographing. The current voltage converter integrator circuit 28 also generates sync signal in response to the release action. Each of the observation light control signal, sync signal and photographing light control signal is transmitted to a light supply unit 22 through a signal transmission line 19 . The signal transmitted is judged through the light supply unit 22 to be observation light control signal, sync signal or photographing light control signal according to its polarity and level. The light control of an observation light source 27 or photographing light source 23 is achieved according to signal judged.
