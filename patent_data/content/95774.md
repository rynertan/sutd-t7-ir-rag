# A switching circuit operable as an amplifier and a muting circuit.

## Abstract
A switching circuit for achieving the amplifying and mut ing operations is disclosed. The switching circuit operates as a non inverting feedback amplifier whenever the circuit per forms either amplification or muting. The non inverting input port of the amplifier is always kept free to receive a given sig nal. An impedance element is connected to the output terminal of the circuit in either the amplifying or muting operation.
