# Coating for metallic substrates, method of production and use of the coating.

## Abstract
Transition metals of the groups IVB, VB and VIB or alloys thereof with Al are electrodeposited in a system of an electrolyte based on an aromatic hydrocarbon. The electro lyte is originally prepared by dissolving 0.02 to 0.2 moles of an inexpensive high ioxidation state transition metal halides and 0.2 to 0.5 moles AlBrâ‚ƒ in 1.00 mole of the aromatic hydrocarbon. Additions of transition metal powders of Mg of Al particles lead to the pre reduction of the high oxidation state transition metal ions to lower oxidation states. Alkali halides may be used to establish favourable bath conditions. The electrolysis is carried out with dissolvable metal anodes, to maintain the bath composition. The plating current density, bath composition and method of preparation are chosen to obtain the desired composition of the coatings.
