# Meniscus prosthesis.

## Abstract
A meniscus prosthetic device 10 for a human knee joint can be inserted into the knee joint so that the articulating carti lage in the knee totally remains intact. The prosthetic device 10 translates between the articulating cartilage during normal knee movement. Insertion of the prosthetic device 10 is ac complished by applying force on the ends of the device 10 , thereby elastically spreading them, and placing the device 10 between the tibia articulating cartilage 63 and one of the fe moral condyles 61, 65 . The forces thus applied can then be released causing the device 10 to conform to its original C shape. Prominences 15, 16 on the ends of the device 10 may superiorly extended into the space 66 defined by the fe moral condyles 61, 65 , thereby securing the device in place.
