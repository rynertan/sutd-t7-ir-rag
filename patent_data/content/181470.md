# Material transfer apparatus of hollow fiber type.

## Abstract
A material transfer apparatus of hollow fiber type is provided comprising a tubular housing, a bundle of a plurality of hollow fiber membranes axially extending through the housing, a first fluid chamber defined by the outer surface of the hollow fibers and the inner surface of the housing, a first fluid inlet and a first fluid outlet both in fluid communication with the first chamber for passing a dialysate into and out of the first chamber, partitions supporting the opposite ends of the hollow fibers and isolating the fiber end from the first chamber, and a second inlet and a second fluid outlet both in fluid communication with the interior space of the hollow fibers for passing a blood into and out of the fiber interior space. Flowpath forming members each having an elastomeric annular member integrally molded thereto are mounted on opposite ends of the housing. The elastomeric member is secured in pressure contact to the partition to provide a fluid tight seal between the partition and the flowpath member.
