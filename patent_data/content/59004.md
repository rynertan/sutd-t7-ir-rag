# Picture display tube and display device provided with such a tube.

## Abstract
By causing in a device for displaying pictures with a dis play tube and a self converging system of deflection coils 24 the focusing in the direction in which the focusing is substan tially independent of the deflection by the system of the deflec tion coils 24 to take place by means of two quadrupole lenses 22, 23 and by the focusing lens 13, 14, 15 in the direction at right angles thereto, it becomes possible to use dynamic fo cusing in said latter direction without defocusing in another di rection. In this manner it becomes possible to obtain a sharp spot all over the screen. By providing an octupole lens coaxially around the elec tron beam and the centre of the focusing lens it also becomes possible to reduce the spherical aberration.
