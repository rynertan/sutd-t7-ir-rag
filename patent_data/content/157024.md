## Description
The present invention relates to an automatic apparatus for the peritoneal dialysis having simplified structure and improved operation.When the kidney functionality is seriously compromised, the patient must undergo a dialysis treatment having the purpose of eliminating from the blood of the patient the toxic wastes which are accumulated thereinto and which would quickly and seriously affect the vital functions of the organism. The dialysis consists in the exchange, through a semipermeable membrane, of the toxic substances between the blood and a dialysis solution. This exchange may take place outside the organism, in that case the dialysis being extrabody, and this is the more widespread treatment.Another type of dialysis which has acquired importance and diffusion in recent years is the peritoneal dialysis, wherein, as the exchange membrane, the peritoneal membrane is used and the dialitic solution is introduced in the peritoneal cavity.It is evident that by this treatment the extrabody circulation of the blood is eliminated with its possible problems and risks, but other problems and drawbacks exist, which are for instance connected to the control of the pressure of the dialysis solution, which fills the peritoneal cavity, the substitution thereof, etc.In the USP 4,381,003 an automatic apparatus is described for the peritoneal dialysis.The apparatus disclosed in said US Patent provides for the displacement of the dialysis solution in a closed circuit mainly comprising, besides the necessary ducts, the bags containing the dialysis liquid and the peritoneal cavity of the patient.The displacement of the liquid is carried out by means of a pump of particular structure having reversible operation.As above mentioned, the amount of liquid introduced in the peritoneal cavity must be a determined amount, since different amounts might induce damages to the patient in the case of an excess amount or an insufficient depuration of blood lacking amount .The main problem arising in automatic apparatus for the peritoneal dialysis is thus that of feeding with a predetermined amount of dialysis liquid. There is worth to mention that the containing bags for the collection of the dialysis liquid preferably contain a liquid amount greater than that is normally introduced in the peritoneal cavity with the aim of feeding, at the beginning of each cycle, at least partially fresh dialysis solution.According to the teaching of said US Patent, the determining of the liquid amount introduced in the peritoneal cavity is carried out through the measurement of the pressure generated by the liquid, and thus by the pump, inside the peritoneal cavity.Such a pressure in the peritoneal cavity is in turn measured, always according to the used tUS P t nt, n the basi cf Fhe pressure head of the liquid upstream of the pump in the direction of filling the peritoneal cavity . More precisely in the duct lenght between the pump and the peritoneal cavity a shunt is provided, essentially operating as a pressure switch which in turn is adapted to control the operation of the pump, particularly the actuation thereof in the loading or emptying phase with respect to the peritoneal cavity.One of the problems in the case of the known apparatus for peritoneal dialysis is that of the control of the pump operation and, particularly, of the related control in the emptying phase, when only one flow circuit is used in both directions namely alternatively for loading and emptying .In fact it may occur, when the control is carried out by pressure switch sensing means, that the pump continues to apply a sucking action to the peritonal cavity even if the latter is empty, since the pressure switch is influenced by conditions extraneous to the operation of the dialysis system fits of coughing, state of agitation of the patient, etc. , thus indicating the existence of a peritoneal pressure and consequently keeping the pump in operation in the emptying phase.The drawbacks deriving from situations of this kind first of all the obstruction of the catheter owing to adjacent tissues, which are sucked onto the catheter, the lack of inversion of the pump cycle whereby the restarting of the dialitic cycle is delayed and a general sense of discomnfort for the patient are per se evident and don t need further comments.The purpose of the present invention is that of providing, for the treatments of peritoneal dialysis, an automatic simplified apparatus, which at the same time permits the circulation of the desired amount of dialysis solution between the feeding bags and the peritoneal cavity and of compensating the variations of disturbing pressure acting within the peritoneal cavity, whereby the measurement of the amount of dialysis liquid used is carried out in a manner which is essentially independent from said disturbing conditions.The automatic dialysis apparatus according to the invention is of the type which comprises at least a feeding and collecting bag of the dialysis solution a connecting duct for the liquid between each bag and the peritoneal cavity of the patient and a reversible rotation pump to provide for the circulation of the dialysis solution in said connecting duct, and is characterized by comprising first dilatable compensating means having controlled dilatation in liquid communication with said peritoneal cavity, said first means being provided in the dialysis apparatus in series in the said duct and being adapted to compensate abrupt variations of pressure in the said duct and second means, connected to said first means with controlled dilatation, adapted to measure their dilatation and to correspondingly control the operation of the pump.According to further features of the invention said first dilatable means consist of a compensating bag of a material dilatable under pressure which is mounted in series in the lenght of dialysis circuit comprised between the pump and the peritoneal cavity, and by elastic means generating a force opposing to the dilatation of said bag, said second means consisting of a linear transducer for the measurement of the dilatation of said compensating bag operating between a fixed reference of the dialysis apparatus and a free wall of said dilatable bag.According to the invention there is thus provided an automatic apparatus for dialysis which is different from those of the same type known to date.According to a surprising feature of invention there is now made possible the use of only one detecting system which is positioned in only one point of the circuit for the feeding and emptying of the dialysis solution filling the pump on the basis of the preadjustable amount of dialitic solution filling the peritoneal cavity and which contemporarily compensate possible operation errors of the controls owing to disturbing factors fits of coughing,etc. ,with the advantage of using an apparatus simpler with respect to the conventional ones and consequently more reliable, less subjected to risks of contamination of the dialysis solution and lastly more economical.Tne presence uf d aL jle Iiia i s also the advantage of damping the pressure pulsations which are generated by the pump, so as to give place to a regular and continuous flow of the dialysis solution towards the peritoneal cavity.These and other features of the invention appear from the following description referred to a preferred embodiment of the automatic apparatus for peritoneal dialysis which is illustrated, for exemplifying but non limiting purpose, in the accompanying figures, in which figure 1 shows the principle scheme of operation of the apparatus for peritoneal dialysis of the invention according to a preferred embodiment figure 2 is a partial cross section of the apparatus of figure 1 figure 3 shows a detail of figure 1 figures 4 and 5 show the operating scheme of another embodiment of the invention and figure 6 shows the pressureoperating time chart of the apparatus of the invention. Referring to figure 1, the apparatus is indicated on the whole by reference 1 and essentially comprises a shaped body 2 for containing the auxiliary parts and the electrical components a pair of bags 4 for the feeding and collecting the dialysis solution, each one being provided with an independent tubular duct 5 and being thermostatized, particularly heated by means of heating resistances 11 a pump 6 with double circulation direction, of known type, which is mounted at the tubular ducts 5 a tubular duct 7, in which the tubular ducts 5 merge by means of a suitable fitting a frame 9 for supporting and containing sensing means for the control of the pump 6 a fitting 10 of known type and adapted for the connection to a catheter not shown already positioned in the peritoneal cavity, particularly of the type permitting the liquid flow towards and from the peritoneal cavity.The apparatus of figure 1 moreover comprises the several control systems valves, electrical components , the use of which is since long time matter per se known and which are omitted for sake of clarity.It is worth to mention that the pump 6 is of the peristaltic type with double pumping pipe for a suitable distribution of the feeding and emptying flow with respect to the two bags and is driven by a reversible electrical motor which makes the pump bidirectional, with possibility of flow rate adjustment by means of adjustment of the motor speed.Within the frame 9 the following components are housed a bag 12 of flexible material adapted to received the dialysis solution from the duct 7 and connected to the fitting 10 a horizontal plane 13 which is vertically slidable and abutting by gravity onto the bag 12 a spiral spring 17 which is calibrated to press onto a bracket 21, which is rigidly connected to the vertical movable plate 22 which in turn is part of an articulated parallelogram mechanism and comprising the fixed wall 14 of the frame 9 and four tie rods, which are two by two parallel to each other, 23 A,B and 24 A, B and which are hinged at their ends as indicated by 25 respectively to the plate 22 and to the wall 14.A displacement of the movable plane 13 as caused by a dilatation of the bag 12 causes an upwardly directed vertical displacement of the plate 22, parallel to itself and the deformation of the articulated parallelogram 14,22,23,24 around the hinges 25.The displacement of the plate 22 causes the bracket 21 to be raised against the action of the spring 17.The tie rods 23 and 24 are preferably elastic, namely capable of undergoing a bending with respect to their main axis, so as to compensate displacements of the plane 13 in a manner which is not parallel to itself, namely when the plane 13 does not remain horizontal. a linear displacement transducer LVDT , of a per se known type, connected to driving motor of tie pump 6, having an electromagnetic coil 15 fixed to the frame 9 of the apparatus and a rod or armature 16, cooperating with the o qnz rtgir nnn ntPri to the bracket 21.According to the shown embodiment the bags 4 contain at the very beginning an amount in excess with respect to that of presumable loading of the peritoneal cavity, the bag 12 is empty and squashed onto the bottom of the frame 9 by effect of the spring 17 and the peritoneal cavity is empty of dialitic solution point 0 of the chart of figure 5 .By actuating the pump 6 the dialitic solution is pumped into the circuit comprising the duct 5,the duct 7 and the bag 12, the fitting 10 and lastly, through the catheter, the peritoneal cavity not shown . The action of the pump thus generates in the delivery circuit a pressure P causing A the dilatation of bag 12.The increase of volume of the bag 12 causes the plane 13 to be raised and displaced upwardly by remaining horizontal.This displacement, through the above disclosed articulated parallelogram mechanism, determines the compression of the spring until the latter reacts with a force RA which equilibrates the pressure PA established within the bag 12.This displacement, which as already stated may be repeated in time, is detected by the transducer 15, 16. During the time in which the pressure PA is attained, little liquid enters the peritoneal cavity, owing to the high resistance raised by the connecting pipe to the patient and by the catheter the pressure drop, with a flow rate of 200 mllmin and with tipical resistances to the flow, being about 400 mmH2O .Upon the pressure PA is attained and the pump is stopped, the spring 17 shall tend to press the plane 13 with a force RA, whereby the bag 12 is emptied for the filling of the patients peritoneal cavity.A period of pressure settling does thus begin, since, the pressure decreases by a value which can be introduced to determine the hysteresis of the system , and the pump will be restarted, so as to fill again the bag 12. Thus, the above behaviour will be repeated until the pressure within the peritoneal cavity shall be statically equal to PA which is tipically selected at 200 mm H2 0 , as shown in fig. 6 by the zigzag part of plot.Consequently, independently from the resistance of the pipe and of the catheter, which may vary also by a great value, for instance owing to fibrine deposition, the loading of the peritoneal cavity will terminate when the pressure of the peritoneal cavity shall be equal to the selected one PA The time necessary for the disappearance of the dynamic component of the pressure as measured by the transducer, i.e. the time required to the termination of the series of pressure adjustments, is tipically of about 5 minutes, but may vary from a dialitic treatment to another one and is also dependent as already stated on the various hydraulic resistances, both distributed and localized exhibited by the flow circuit.Upon the pressure PA is definitely attained in the peritoneal cavity, the pump is inverted, whereby the peritoneal cavity is emptied.The pump feeds back to the bags 4 a predetermined amount of dialitic solution which is removed from the peritoneal cavity, and is preferably lesser then the initially fed amount.The transfer of such a liquid amount from the peritoneal cavity to the bags 4 causes the pressure in the bag 12 to be reduced from Pea zero or even to a negative pressure after the aforesaid settlement period it in turn determines a negative variation of the bag volume, with consequent lowering of the plane 13. A timing device causes the rotation of the pump 4 to be inverted. In this way there is made possible to detect pressures and their variations comprised between 100 and 600 mm H2 0. It is to be noticed that the spring 17 is calibrated so that it generates a force such as to prevent the plane 13 from being raised owing to possible abrupt variations of pressure in the bag 12, as caused for instance by fits of coughing of the patient and by other factors extraneous to the transfer of dialysis solution to and from the peritoneal cavity.It is also ensured that accidental pressure increases do not prevent the desired pressure PA from being attained on the contrary the transducer 15,16 would actuate the pump, in the filling phase, so as to start the sucking step with removal from the peritoneal cavity of an amount of dialysis solution greater than the predetermined one. In the case in which a low pressure drop exist in the circuit such as a few mm H2O , 2 it is also possible to obtain a pressure emptying, i.e. until a minimum pressure is achieved. Or course tflis situation aepends on the availability of a suitable catheter.The inversion of the pump causes the pressure to be again increased from PB to PA, correspondinqly to the volume increase of the bag 12, up to previous volume, sensed by the transducer 15,16, to which the transfer of the desired amount of dialysis solution from the bags 4 to the peritoneal cavity corresponds. The complete dialitic treatment extends over about 8 hours.Warning sensing means not shown are moreover provided in the frame 9 for sensing a minimum and maximum level of plane 13, which are adjusted so as to be actuated in case of operating defect of the transducer 15, 16, in case of damage of the bag 12 and in case of loss of calibration of the spring 17. The circuit is also provided with sensing means of negative pressure.These warning tresholds are theoretically double namely upper and lower since one pair is provided as safety for the transducer 15, 16 and the other one for the displacement of the plate 13.The related tresholds in figure 5 are indicated by pressure values which are corresponding and adjustably provided. P, indicates the predetermined upper threshold value for the transducer 15, 16 PMS indicates the predetermined upper treshold value for the plate 13.Obviously only upper threshold limits are described, since in this embodiment the emptying phase is controlled by timing means.In the embodiment of figures 3 and 4 the bag 12 has been substituted for by a dilatable body or bellows housed within a chamber 19 filled with a pressure fluid, for instance air, through the fitting 20. The behaviour of the bellows 18, for instance of elastic sinthetic material, is like that of the bag 12.In this embodiment, the volume increase of bellows 18 is opposed by the air pressure within the chamber 19. The increase and the diminution of volume of the bellows 18 is turned into an increase and respectively diminution of pressure in the chamber 19, which are sensed by a pressure transducer 31 controlling the motion of the pump 6 according to the pressure limit value PA as attained in the peritoneal cavity.The residual air pressure in the chamber 19, within the bellows 18 upon the peritoneal cavity has been emptied, within the bellows 18 is such as to compensate abrupt pressure variations. Of course it is possible to carry out further variations and modifications which, however, if based on the general concept of automatically controlling the circulation of the dialysis solution on the basis of measurements of volume of a dilatable body or element inserted in the dialysis circuit, fall within the protection scope of the above described invention.Otherwise stated, the dilatable compensating bag 12 operates as a flow element of the dialysis solution, as a tank for collection and the compensation of abrupt variations of pressure taking place downstream of the same bag, and as a mechanical signalling member of the solution volume fed to the peritoneal cavity. At the same time the maximum safety conditions of operation of the dialysis apparatus are maintained.
