# Oxygen scavenging and heat generating compositions and deoxygenating and heat generating structures comprising these compositions.

## Abstract
An oxygen scavenger composition consisting essentially of a metallic iron, and b at least one oxidation promoter selected from the group consisting of sodium silicate hydrates, silicic acid, sodium alum and sodium borate hydrates, and optionally c at least one oxidation promoter aid which is a metal halide compound, and or d a water insoluble or sparingly water soluble inert filler a heat generating composition having an initial rate of oxygen scavenging of at least 5 ml per gram of said composition in the air at 20 C during a period of one hour after the oxidation reaction has substantially begun, said composition consisting substantially of the metallic iron a , a sodium silicate hydrate, and or silicic acid as an oxidation promoter b , the oxidation promoter aid c and optionally the filler d a deoxygenating structure comprising the oxygen scavenger composition and a film having an oxygen permeability of at least 0.005 ml cm².min.atm. O₂ partial pressure covering said composition and a heat generating structure comprising the heat generating composition and a film having an oxygen permeability of 0.4 to 10 ml cm².min.atm O₂ partial pressure covering said composition.
