## Description
MOVING AND LIFTING GEAR FOR GOODS AND COMMODITIES The object of t e invention has h en defined in the introductionary chapter of claim 1. The loading platforms and pal lets equiped with wheels used corronly in vans and trailers as aids in goodshandling are usually so called rear platform lifters, which have been fixed to the rear of the car for lifting the pal lets to tile trunk. Another known method is to lift the pal lets with various motor driven truck machines to the trunk. Various loading bridges designed for vans have also been used as ai s. These can be either fixed or vertically adjustable loading bridges. Various types of lifts provided with tackle gears and overhanging bars are used as aids in loading.These are usually hydraulically acting lifting gears fixed to the body of the car or various types of conveyor elevators and conveyor belts, which are usedLO move the pal lets out of the trunk and into it. The US 2 676 72r specification has suggested a moving and lifting ocar which could be attached under the platform of the van. The arrangement includes a body provided with wheels and a chasislike jih member situated above and supported by the body. During trans oration the arrangement can be lifted vertically behind the side of the loading platform. The lower bars of the chasislike jib member have been pivotally connected from heir lower parts to a lifting member.This member s pivotal connections are able to slide in a horizontal track. The upper bars have been pivotally connected from their upper ends to the jib and from their lower ends to the frame, where the pivotal connections are able to slide horizontally. The loading and lifting gear suggested in the US 2 603 454 specification consists of a complicate crank arm arrangement. In this case the lifting jibs of the arrejnqement have been connected pivotal ly to the centre and rear end of the platform. The upper part of the jibs have also been connected to tbn body.Extensions have been connected to thp upper pivotal connections of the jibs, which extensions are inclined forward, when the loading platform is in its lowered position. A balancing bar has been placed between these extensions. The task of this balancing bar is to hold the loading platform in a lateral position during a lifting operation. The transportation member for the jib arrangement has been connected outside the trunk below the loading platform. The biggest drawback in the presently used loading platforms or pal lets equipped with wheels used in vans or trailers is the moving, lifting and lowering of the loaded platform. These drawbacks can be obviated slightly by the use of workforce, which results in less effective man hours. Using workforce also jeopardizes safety at work as the loaded pallet may be heavy. Of the known aids the so caller rear platforn lifters are well suited only for lifting purposes, but the drawback in them are high manufacturing and assembly costs which are a consequence of their complicated structure.The practical flexibility of the arrangement is limited because of its fixture to the vehicle. The drawbacks of various trucks adapted for this purpose are their high manufacturing costs and relatively high weight and large outer dimensions, which result in difficulties during loading especially in such vans, where the backdoor often opens upwards.Taking the trucklifter along in the van s trunk during transportation would also require a suitable loading bridge or rear side lift. A drawback is also that the truck lifter would require a practically unaccept able space of the trunk space. Controllahle loading platforms, lifting cars, jibs and conveyors are usually situated in large well eguiped freighter stations and warehouses of large wholesales. Thus a drawback is their unavailability especially at delivery points. The Arawhac .cs of the arrannements mentioned in the first publication is that the lifting platform cannot be towered properly and the arrangement is long compared to the lifting height that it can achieve. These drawbacks are due to the scissorslike structure of the arrangement. More over the lenghty structure requires space. The structure shown in the second publication, where the jibs have been connected to the end and piddle of the platform result in a larqe deviation of the pivotal connections. The deviation between the upper pivotal connections, attached also to the frame, have to be equal. This arrangement results in great height and length or width, which requires a nractecally unacceptable space. moreover it needs a separate lifting mechanism for lifting it into a van. The drawbacks of the moving and lifting gear suggested in the specifications mentioned above are, inter alia their complicated and heavy construction, large space requirements, high manufacturing costs due to complicated structure and unsuitable structure for flexible goods handling. The object of the invention is to obviate the drawbacks mentioned above. Especially the purpose of the invention is to provide a goods handling equipment which obviates the heavy working procedures occurring during storage and tranportation and which can be easily situated into a van requiring only a minor space. The reader is referred to the claims in order to familierise himself with the characteristic features of the invention. The moving and lifting arrangement according to this invention comprises of a moving and lifting member as well as a loading and transportation member.The moving and lifting arrangement includes a frame which is connected to forr3 projected truc li1e frank bearing beams. To the ends of the frame bearing beams and the frame there has heen attached at least three wheels of which at least one has been mounte pivotally. Pivoted lifting members have also been attached to the body, which with the aid of a power member lift and lower the platform attached to them. This part of the lifting and transportation member consists advantageously of two mainly straigth beams, which have been rigidly connected to each other in an angle.In a modification of the invention the lifting members consist mainly of an arches beam construction. The lifting members consist of at least two beamlie parts, namely, a lifting beam and a supporting beam. In one useful modification of the invention the arrangement includes one lirting beam and two supporting beams placed sidewise to the the lifting beam. Thus the supporting beams act only as supports, while the lifting beam with the aid of a power member connected to it carries out the actual lifting duty. The connections between the lifting members, the frame and platform have been achieved by using three pairs of pivots. These three pairs of pivots are arranged in such a way that the axis of rotation of all the pivots never lie all on the same plane. Therefore the structure of the moving and lifting member is sturdy in the lateral as well as vertical direction. One structural modification according to the invention includes another body member in the loading and tranportation member, said member being attachable to a trailer, loading platform or likewise structure.The member includes a pivotally mounted bridge member, which can be turned vertically upwards. The bridge member comprises mainly of two bar or beamlike projected parts at a distance apart from each other. Said parts include tracklike, hooklike or somehow projected clamp meml rs to which the lifting platform can he supported. The flexibility can be regarded as the most irportant advantage of the invention, because the same equipment can be used for fetching the goods items from warehouses and moving them to the vicinity of the van. After which they can he loaded on the loading and transnortation member with which the pallet is easily moved into the trunk of the van. Then the movina and lifting member is clamped to the loading anc trans portation member and is lifted to the trunk, where it is transported requiring only a minor space. At the delivery points the equipment is instantaneously ready for unloading.The arrangement is very advantageous in vans and trailers due to its lightness and small space requirements. Due to its simple and reliable structure as well as easy mountability it can be fixed cheaply into all known transportation vehicles. A further advantage of the invention is as the other ends of the lifting members have been connected pivotally to the middle of the platform the opposite ends have been connected pivotally to the frame achieving a minimum distance of separation between the pivots, while allowing for the strength of the material. A pivotsupportstructure has been achieved by a so called balancing beam situated in the middle of the lifting members omitting the need of any extensions or otherwise complicated structures. These constructural features of the invention result in a more effective, simple and less space requiring structure, when compared to the prior art. Another advantage of the equipment is also, that it can be adapted as well to sidewise or rearwise loadable vans or trailers. The arrangement is by no means limited to the model or type of the van, but is easily Countable and dismountable in a quick and advantageous manner to various van and platform struc tures, neither does it cause any changes in theprimary structure of the object to which it has been fixed. The same arrangement is suited also for attachment onto various loading platfo s. Moreover the equipflent according to the invention does not need any outsize energy source or power unit in order to operate as the whole operation takes place due to pumping, pushing and lifting movements requiring only a relatively small force. In order to explain the invention in more detail reference is made to the accompanying drawings in which figure 1 shows a novina and lifting member according to this invention, figure 2 shows a lifting and transportation member according to this invention, figure 3 is a sideview of figure 1, figure 4 shows an operational step, when using an equipment according to the invention, figure 5 shows an other operational step, when using an equipment according to the invention, figure 6 shows a further operational step. The moving and lifting member according to this invention shown in figure 1 consists of a frame 1, frame bearing beams 2, wheels attached to the ends of the frame bearing beams and below the frame, a lifting platform 4 and lifting member connecting said platform to the frame. The lifting members include a bar or tubelike structure which has been pivotally connected in an angle to the frame forming a lifting jih, and two pivotally connected beams forming an angleous structure and acting as support beams 9. In addition the lifting jib has been connected to the frame through a power member 6 which includes a lifting cylinder 28, a pumping member 29, a guiding ventile 30 and a crank bar 32. Moreover a handle 7 has been pivotally connected to the frame.The lifting chip and support beams have been connected pivotally to the frame through pivots 10 and 11 respectively. The support beams have been connected to the lifting jib pivotally through pivot supports 16. In addition the movin and lifting member comprises of a gasspring 17 arranged to lift the fra é 1 ,and the frame bearing beans to t vicinity of the lifting platform 4. Figure 2 shows one loading and liftingmember 18 according to this invention, which member can be connected to a van, trailer or loading platform. It includes a body member 19 which can be connected to the above mentioned objects, and a bridge member 20 pivotally connected to the body member. The bridge member comprises of two trucklike projections 22 below which ends tracklike fastening memoers 21 have been connected.Balancing springs 23, damping elements 24 and a clamping device 75 have bo.n connected between the body member and three member in order to fix the latter rigidly to the former. Figure 3 shows a sidewise view of the device according to this invention. A generating power member 6 is connected to the lifting jib 8, the purpose of said poer member being to lift and lower the platform 4. The power member consists of a lifting cylinder 28 connected to the frame 1, a pumping member 29, a guiding ventile 30 and a crank bar 32. In addition a spring 26 has been connected to the frame 1 and the lifting jib 8. The purpose of this spring is to pull the frame 1 and the frame bearing beams 2 to the neighbourhood of the lifting members 5. The lifting jib 8 has been pivotally mounted to the frame 1 through pivots 10 and the support beams 9 have been connected to the said frame throuqh pivots 11. The axis of rotation of the pivots 10 and 11 are parallel with respect to each other and at a distance a apart from each other. In a modification of the invention shown in figure 3 the axis of rotation of the pivots 10 and 11 are also in the same ground plane. The lifting jib and support means have been pivotally connected to the lifting platform 4 through pivots 12 and 13 which axis of rotation are also at the distance a apart fror each other in the same grout1 plant. The lifting jih and support beams have been pivotmountel to each other with a pivotsupport 16 from corners or the beams.The pivotsupport 16 includes a pivot 1r for the lifting jih and a pivot 15 for the support bean. The axis of rotation of these pivots are also parallel to each other and at a distance a apart. Tine axis of rotation of the pivots 14 and 15 are also situated also in the same ground plane. The planes in which the three pairs of central axes of the pivots 10, 11, 12, 13, 1t and 15 lie are also parallel to each other and in the shown adaptation they are also lateral. The axis of rotation of the six pivots are parallel and the pairs of axis are at a distance a apart from each other. The planes on which the pairs of rotating axis lie can also be positioned in a non lateral fashion as long as all the three planes are parallel w.r.t. each other. A handle 7 has also been connected pivotally to the frame 1 , which handle can, thus, be turned forward into a parallel position w.r.t. the frame bearing beams 2 . Figures 4 to 6 clarify the operation of the moving and lifting arrangement according to this invention during the various steps associated with goods handling. The commodities loaded on a loading platform or pallet are fetched with the moving and lifting member 27 and brought to the vicinity of the loading and tranportation member 18 which has been fixed to the platform. Pumping on the lifting cylinder 28 through the crank bar 32 causes the consignment to rise above the level of the bridge member 20. Then the moving and lifting member is pushed between the projections 22 and the consignment is lowered on the barlike projections 22. Thus, the consignment situated above the tracklike projections can be pushed on the platform 33. Afterwards the moving and lifting member 27 is pulled away from between the projections 22 and the lifting platform 4 is lowered by the aid of the guiding gentile 30 to the level of the tracklike fastening members 21. The lifting member is then again pushed below the bridge member so that the loading platform is clampped to the fastening members 21. Then the work member 17 or 26, is released by the guiding ventile 30 and thus pulls the frame up to the same level as the loading platform. At the same time the handle 7 can be turned above the loading platform into a mainly parallel position to said platform.By opening the clamping device 25 the lifting member can be lifted fro a lifting handle 31 vertically above the platform 33. The lifting action is eased by balancing sprinys 23 and a damping element 24 the latter acting as to damp the otherwise too violent novements caused by the former. The procedure during unloading is exactly the opposite. The clamp of the vertical loading and transportation member is opened and the arrangement is turned to the lateral position. Closing the guiding ventile 30 and pumping on from the crab bar lowers the lifting member to the ground level. The platform d is dismantled from its tracklike fastening members 21 and the consignment brought on the bridge member 20 can be lifted hy the lifting platform and lowered by releasing from the guiding ventile 30.After which the consignment can be moved to the desired point. The moving and lifting member 27 according to this invention can be used seperately without the loazins and transportation member 18 in various movingand lifting duties. The lifting member can also be scaled to the desired size according to the desired lifting power and lifting height. The objects of the hydraulic part of the lifting gear can be realized also y other means.The loading and transportation member can also be variously constructed and characteris tic to it is that the consignment can be brought to it by the movin and lifting member 27 and that the moving and liftingmember can be lifted with it for transportation in a small compact forn. The arrangement according to this invention can alsQ be mounted for example to sidewise loadable vehicles and to various trailers or loading platforms. The above specifies only one advantageous nodification of the arrangement according to this invention. However the invention is by no means limited to the arrangement described above, and the modifications can vary within the inventive step characterised by the claims.
