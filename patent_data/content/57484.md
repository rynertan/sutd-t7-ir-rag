# Apparatus for uniformly debossing and aperturing a resilient plastic web.

## Abstract
Method and apparatus for constructing a three di mensional film forming structure for imparting a uni formly apertured three dimensional pattern to a heated plastic material subjected to a fluid pressure differen tial while in contact with said forming structure. In a preferred embodiment, said forming structure is created by forming a substantially continuous pattern of apertu res in a multiplicity of planar sheets, at least a portion of said sheets having aperture patterns which are con centrically aligned but dissimilar in size to one another. The sheets having said concentrically aligned aperture patterns are thereafter superposed upon one another so as to form a stack exhibiting a three dimensional con tinuum of capillary networks. A sufficient number of laminae are employed to ensure that said networks are of greater overall length than the maximum depth to which the plastic film being processed thereon is drawn when subjected to said fluid pressure differential. Said capillary networks exhibit a cross sectional area which reaches a minimum intermediate the uppermost and lowermost surfaces of the stack and thereafter increases in the direction of the lowermost surface of the stack to increase fluid permeability. The superposed sheets are bonded to one another at contact points while in the stacked configuration to form an integral laminate struc ture. The laminate forming structure is preferably caused
