# Flexible tie for tangent tube construction.

## Abstract
Tie means employable for purposes of accomplishing the tying together of tubes of a superheater platen assembly. The subject tie means is particularly suited for use in those applications wherein a need exists to effect the tying together of tubes, which bear a tangential relationship to each other. The subject tie means comprises a multiplicity of cooperating tie members that are suitably affixed such as by being welded thereto, to the pair of tubes that the tie means is intended to tie together. More specifically, the multiplicity of tie members includes a pair of tie members 26,28 that is affixed to a first one of the pair of tubes and a second pair of tie members 30,32 that is affixed to the second one of the pair of tubes. Each of the multiplicity of tie members is essentially L shaped in configuration with the first pair of tie members 26,28 being oriented so as to each have a portion 26a,28a thereof, which projects inwardly, while a second pair of tie members 30,32 is oriented so that each of the tie members has a portion 30a,32a thereof, which projects outwardly, whereby the inwardly projecting portions 26a,28a of the first pair of tie members are supported in sliding engagement with the outwardly projecting portions 30a,32a of the second pair of tie members thereby to effect the tying together of the aforesaid pair of tubes through the interengagement of the respective projecting portions of the first and second pairs of tie members.
