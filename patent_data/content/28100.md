# Tuning control apparatus for a receiver.

## Abstract
A voltage controlled oscillator 26 which serves as the lo cal oscillator of a tuner, is controlled by a phase locked loop 5 and an automatic frequency control loop 3 , both of which are operable to provide a control voltage to the voltage controlled oscillator 26 . An analog switch 22 is controlled in such a manner that the phase locked loop 5 provides the control voltage for the voltage controlled oscillator 26 when a station is being selected, and the automatic frequency control loop 3 provides the control voltage when the tuner is receiving a de sired broadcasting wave. The automatic frequency control loop 3 includes a fre quency discriminator 10 , a window comparator 18 and a charge pump 20 . The phase locked loop 5 includes fre quency dividing means 28, 30 a phase comparator 32 and a charge pump 36 . The outputs from the two charge pumps 20, 36 are applied through the analog switch 22 to a com mon low pass filter 24 the output of which is applied to the voltage controlled oscillator 26 as the control voltage. The state of the tuner is detected in response to the output of an intermediate frequency amplifier 8 and a signal indicating whether the phase locked loop is in a locked state.
