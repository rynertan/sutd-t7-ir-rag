# Electrode shield device.

## Abstract
An electrode shield device for use in conjunction with a needle electrode preferably embodied in an oven. The shield device includes a perforated plate 32 and mechanical means 22 supporting the plate 32 for causing relative movement between the plate 32 and the needle electrode 16 . In operation, the mechanical means 22 locating the plate 32 in a spaced relationship to cover the needle electrode 16 for preventing physical contact with the needles when the electrode is electrically inactive and 14 the mechanical means 22 locating the plate 32 in an engaging relationship to expose the needles for permitting the needles to establish current contact with, for example, high potential food.
