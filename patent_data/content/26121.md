# Process for preparing polyarylates in the presence of a diphenyl ether compound and a magnesium catalyst.

## Abstract
The present invention deals with a process for preparing polyarylates in the presence of a diphenyl ether compound and a magnesium catalyst. According to the invention, polyarylates are prepared by the reaction of a diester derivative of a dihydric phenol with an aromatic dicarboxylic acid in the presence of from about 10 to about 60 weight percent of a diphenyl ether compound at a temperature of from about 260 to 350 C and in the presence of a magnesium catalyst. This process provides a polyarylate of acceptable molecular weight with a better removal of the acid by product in a reactant system having a reduced viscosity.
