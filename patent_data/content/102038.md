# DEVELOPING DEVICE AND DEVELOPING METHOD

## Abstract
A developing device 18 develops an electrostatic latent image formed on a photosensitive layer of a photosensitive drum 14 by a toner 40 and is provided with a developing roller 36 which rotatably faces the photosensitive layer and is adopted to rotate with the toner 40 thereon forming a toner layer 42 , such that the toner 40 is transferred to the photosensitive layer to develop the electrostatic latent image, and a doctor blade 41 which is spaced from the developing roller 36 , for regulating the thickness of the toner layer 42 formed on the developing roller 36 . The toner 40 consists of an electrically insulating toner whose surface potential Vt on the developing roller 36 has polarity opposite to that of changes on the electrostatic latent image and absolute value greater than 20 volts and smaller than 90 volts .
