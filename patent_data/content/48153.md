## Description
The invention relates to emulsions. More particularly, the invention relates to high internal phase water in oil emulsions suitable for the preparation of cosmetic, pharmaceutical and other products and to methods for the preparation of such emulsions. By high internal phase emulsion is meant an emulsion in which the volume of the internal phase occupies at least 75 of the total volume of the emulsion. Water in oil emulsions, other than high internal phase emulsions, have been employed in the formulation of cosmetic and pharmaceutical ointments, emollient creams and lotions. However, while such emulsions can impart desirable characteristics of water repellancy to the skin and provide a means whereby fats, oils and waxes can be absorbed onto human skin, the use of such emulsions in skin treatment products has sometimes been precluded because they have been implicated in toxicity, skin irritancy or excessive greasiness in use. The problem of instability has also limited the use of high internal phase water in oil emulsions in cosmetics and pharmaceutical products where storage stability is a pre requisite. A study was accordingly undertaken to examine the instability of these emulsions and to establish means whereby stability could be improved. It was found, for example, that high internal phase water in oil emulsions containing as skin benefit agents a water soluble metallic salt dissolved in the aqueous phase, are stable for no more than a few days. Syneresis of the internal phase or even separation of the oily and aqueous phases can then generally be seen as an accumulation of oil at the surface of the emulsion. This problem has led to the screening of many substances in a search for a stabilising agent whose incorporation in a product based on a high internal phase emulsion would effectively extend the shelf life of that product at normal storage temperatures. EP A 9404 discloses high internal phase water in oil emulsions which incorporate water soluble amino acid or a salt thereof as a stabilising agent. The range disclosed extends from 0.5 to 25 by weight. Examples 12, 13 and 16 of this document includes the montmorillonite clay derivative Bentone 38. It has now been discovered that this problem of instability of the high internal phase emulsion on storage can be overcome by incorporating into the emulsion, in addition to a water soluble metallic salt, a special montmorillonite clay derivative. The high internal phase emulsions so obtained have excellent storage characteristics in that the water and oil phases do not separate when the emulsion is stored for at least three months, even at a tropical temperature of 50 C, or when subjected repeatedly to freezing at a temperature of 10 and thawing at ambient temperature of 20 C. These high internal phase emulsions are accordingly suitable for use in the preparation of cosmetic and pharmaceutical products, particularly for topical application to human skin. They lack the aforementioned disadvantages in that they are non toxic, non irritating to the skin, not excessively greasy in use and do not suffer from instability on storage. It has also been observed that inclusion of the special montmorillonite clay derivative in the emulsion unexpectedly provides a further benefit in addition to that of imparting a very high degree of stability to the emulsion after manufacture and during storage, and that is enabling the emulsion to break almost instantly when applied topically to human skin, thus permitting any skin benefit ingredient in the emulsion to be more readily available for uptake by the skin. The stability imparted by the special montmorillonite clay derivative is all the more surprising when it is realised how intrinsically unstable are high internal phase water in oil emulsions. It is accordingly totally unexpected that the special montmorillonite clay derivative should exhibit, as we have shown, on the one hand stability of the emulsion in its container, while on the other hand allowing the emulsion to break when applied topically to the skin. Accordingly, the invention provides a high internal phase water in oil emulsion comprising, in addition to water, an oil, an emulsifier and a stabilising agent, characterised in that The invention also provides a process for preparing a high internal phase water in oil emulsion which comprises the steps of The emulsion according to the invention consists of an internal phase which is aqueous and an external phase which is oily. It should be explained that water in oil emulsions which are not high internal phase emulsions usually consist of from 1 to 74 by volume of an aqueous phase dispersed in 99 to 26 by volume of an oily phase. A water in oil emulsion consisting of 74 by volume aqueous phase and 26 by volume oily phase represents the theoretical maximum packing volume concentration of rigid monodisperse spheres of water as the internal phase in oil as the external phase. Hence, water in oil emulsions containing more than 74 aqueous phase are high internal phase emulsions. The water in oil emulsion of the invention comprises from 75 to 98 , preferably 80 to 97 by volume of an aqueous phase and from 2 to 25 , preferably 3 to 20 by volume of an oily phase respectively. In order to obtain optimum stability of the high internal phase water in oil emulsions, it has been shown necessary to select carefully the oil ingredient, the emulsifier and to employ a special montmorillonite clay derivative as a special emulsion stabiliser with the magnesium salt to ensure that the emulsions once made generally remain stable over an extended period of time. The oil should preferably be liquid at room temperature 20 C and should be cosmetically and pharmaceutically acceptable. It is however also possible to employ waxes which can be solid at room temperature. The oil, other oily material and wax as herein referred to as oil . The oil should also be non polar and should contain branched chain alkyl groups. The preferred oils are highly branched chain mineral oils. Examples of preferred oils are in decreasing order of preference The quantity of oil in the emulsion is from 1.4 to 24.3 , preferably from 2 to 24 , and most preferably from 2 to 15 by weight of the emulsion. If the emulsion contains less than 1.4 oil, it is generally not possible to obtain a stable water in oil emulsion, whereas if the emulsion contains more than 24.3 oil, then the emulsion will cease to exhibit the special properties and characteristics attributable to a high internal phase emulsion. The emulsifier should be liquid at room temperature 20 C and be cosmetically and pharmaceutically acceptable it should also not be anionic in character, otherwise there is a possibility that it will interfere with the stabilising effect of the montmorillonite clay which is cationic in character. The emulsifier should have an HLB value of from 1 to 7, preferably from 2 to 6. Examples of suitable emulsifiers are in decreasing order of preference The quantity of emulsifier in the emulsion is from 0.5 to 10 , preferably 2 to 5 by weight of the emulsion. If the emulsion contains less than 0.5 of emulsifier, it is unlikely that the emulsion, if obtained, will remain stable on storage, whereas if the emulsion contains more than 10 of emulsifier, the stability of the emulsion can be adversely affected. The special montmorillonite clay derivative is a reaction product of a sodium magnesium fluorolithosilicate trioctahedral montmorillonite clay and the quaternary ammonium salt having the formula where R represents hydrogenated tallow fatty acid radicals. This montmorillonite clay derivative is hereinafter referred to as Quaternium 18 Hectorite. An example of Quaternium 18 Hectorite is Bentone 38 available from National Lead Industries. The quantity of Quaternium 18 Hectorite in the emulsion is from 0.1 to 5 , preferably 0.1 to 1 by weight of the emulsion. If the emulsion contains less than 0.1 of the Quaternium 18 Hectorite, it is unlikely that the emulsion will remain stable on storage, whereas if the emulsion contains more than 5 Quaternium 18 Hectorite, the emulsion is likely to be too viscous to employ as a cosmetic or pharmaceutical product, particularly for topical application to the skin. The emulsion of the invention also comprises a water soluble magnesium salt which not only serves to provide an additional cosmetic benefit to the emulsion when applied topically to human skin, but which also further enhances the stability of the emulsion during storage after manufacture and before use. Thus, it has been shown that water in oil high internal phase emulsions comprising a branched chain non polar oil, a non anionic liquid emulsifier and the montmorillonite clay, but without magnesium salt in the aqueous phase, are stable under ambient storage conditions for only a few days or weeks. The further incorporation of a water soluble magnesium salt into such a high internal phase emulsion dramatically enhances their stability such that they can remain stable, even at a storage temperature of from 5 C to 60 C, for many months or even years without showing any sign of syneresis. Accordingly, it is an essential feature of the invention that the water in oil high internal phase emulsions comprise both the montmorillonite clay, as herein described, and the water soluble salt of magnesium. Examples of suitable water soluble salts of magnesium are magnesium sulphate, magnesium sulphate heptahydrate, magnesium sulphate monohydrate, magnesium acetate, magnesium bromide, magnesium bromide hexahydrate, magnesium chloride, magnesium chloride hexahydrate, magnesium iodide, magnesium iodide octahydrate and magnesium nitrate hexahydrate. The preferred magnesium salt is magnesium sulphate heptahydrate. The amount of the water soluble magnesium salt present in the emulsion will usually be from 0.1 to 5 , preferably from 0.1 to 2 by weight of the emulsion the actual amount employed will depend on which magnesium salt is selected. If the emulsion contains less than 0.1 by weight of the magnesium salt, it is unlikely that the stability of the emulsion will be improved beyond that due to the presence of the Quaternium 18 Hectorite, whereas if the emulsion contains more than 5 by weight of the magnesium salt, it is unlikely that the stabilisation of the emulsion can be further enhanced. The emulsion also comprises water. The quantity of water in the emulsion is from 0.1 to 97.9 , preferably 1 to 97, most preferably 60 to 95 by weight of the emulsion. If the emulsion contains more than 97.9 of water, the stability of the emulsion on storage is likely to be poor and syneresis can occur. The emulsion according to the invention can be employed as a vehicle for a wide variety of cosmetically or pharmaceutically active ingredients, particularly ingredients which have some beneficial effect when applied to the skin. The emulsion thus provides a means whereby such active ingredients can be diluted, preserved, conveyed to and distributed on the skin surface at an appropriate concentration. Especially preferred examples of active ingredients include moisturisers such as sodium pyrollidone carboxylate, sodium lactate, lactic acid, triethanolamine lactate and sodium chloride. Examples of other active ingredients that can also be employed include sunscreen agents, germicides, deodorants, antiperspirants, healing agents. The emulsion according to the invention can also contain functional adjuncts for further controlling the properties of a pharmaceutical or cosmetic composition containing the emulsion. Functional adjuncts include antioxidants, propellants, solvents, humectants, thickeners and emollients. The high internal phase water in oil emulsions of the invention can be prepared by mixing the Quaternium 18 Hectorite with the liquid emulsifier having an HLB value of from 1 to 7 and the oil to provide an oily phase and subsequently homogenising from 2 to 25 parts by volume of the oily phase with from 75 to 98 parts by volume of the aqueous phase water containing the water soluble magnesium salt and other water soluble ingredients, if any, to provide the emulsion. The compositions of the invention can be liquid, for example products such as lotions for use in conjunction with applicators such as a roll ball applicator or a spray device such as an aerosol can containing propellant or a container fitted with a pump to dispense the product. Alternatively, the compositions of the invention can be semi solid, for example creams or gels, for use in conjunction with an applicator such as a powder sifter or a stick applicator, or simply a tube or lidded jar. The invention accordingly also provides a closed container containing a cosmetically acceptable composition as herein defined. The invention is illustrated by the following examples This example illustrates a high internal phase water in oil emulsion moisturising cream w o HIPE cream for topical application to the skin. This w o HIPE cream contained the following ingredients The oils were mixed with the emulsifier, the Quaternium 18 Hectorite and the preservative to provide the oily phase. The aqueous phase containing water, the magnesium sulphate heptahydrate and the emollient and moisturising electrolyte was then added slowly at first and then more rapidly to the oily phase with stirring until an emulsion in the form of a white cream was obtained. The mixing step was carried out at room temperature, i.e. at about 23 C. Finally the perfume was distributed throughout the emulsion. In order to test the stability of the cream, samples were stored at 23 C, 35 C, 42 C and at 50 C. After more than six months storage, there was no sign in any of the samples of syneresis or breakdown of the emulsion. Likewise, repeated freeze thaw cycling from 5 C to 42 C did not indicate any such instability in the product. The product was accordingly judged completely stable and suitable for sale to consumers. When applied to the human skin, the product has a pleasant creamy texture, is easily distributed topically and breaks on contact with the skin. The release of the aqueous phase gives the consumer a pleasant fresh sensation which is judged as signalling a moisturising effect. The superiority of this product was confirmed subjectively by a comparative consumer test in which 150 female subjects were asked to assess the product against their regular skin cream, under a series of headings describing subjective attributes. In each case, the panellists were asked to apply a score on a 5 point scale 0 disagree, product totally unacceptable 5 agree, product excellent . The results, which include an average of scores obtained under each heading, are summarised in the following Table It can be concluded from these results that the w o HIPE cream was superior in all respects to the creams usually employed by the panelists, and was generally very well liked. The efficacy of the w o HIPE cream was assessed objectively under the following headings The moisturising efficacy of the w o HIPE cream was substantiated in vivo on human subjects using skin impedance measurements and transepidermal water loss measurements. Skin impedance was measured by the method of Clar et al. J. Soc. Cosmet. Chem., 1975 , The moisturising efficacy of the w o HIPE cream was accordingly compared with that of three commercially available brands of cream, each of which claim to be a moisturising cream. It was demonstrated that the w o HIPE cream induced a marked decrease in skin impedance indicative of a substantial moisturising effect, whereas none of the commercial moisturising creams showed a significant reduction in impedance, indicating that they have little or no true moisturising effect. Living skin perspires continuous and it is possible to monitor this water loss by means of a hygrometric sensor attached to the skin. A barrier cream is one which is able to impede water loss from the skin surface. The barrier effect of the w o HIPE cream was accordingly compared with that of the three commercially available moisturising creams it was shown following statistical analysis of the results that the w o HIPE cream significantly reduced transepidermal water loss, whereas the commercial creams did not. When a cream is applied topically to the skin, evaporation of water causes a drop in skin temperature due to the loss of skin calories by latent heat of evaporation. This cooling effect is recognised by the user as freshness. The freshness sensation can be substantiated objectively by measurement of skin temperature using a telethermometer. The freshness following application of the w o HIPE cream was compared with that following application of the three different commercially available skin moisturising creams. From the telethermometer readings, it was established the w o HIPE cream generated the greatest fall in skin temperature which substantiated the subjective observations of the panel who reported that the w o HIPE cream produced the most striking sensation of freshness. The oil is mixed with the emulsifier, the Para P added and dissolved at a temperature of 50 60 C. The Bentone 38 is then added to provide the oily phase. The aqueous phase containing the magnesium salt, the lactate and the glycol are heated gently at 45 50 C. Finally, the emulsion is prepared after cooling by emulsifying the aqueous phase with the oily phase to provide a water in oil emulsion at a temperature no higher than 50 C.
