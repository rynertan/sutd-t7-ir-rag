# Improved extruded fin type weatherstrip.

## Abstract
An integrally extruded all plastic weatherstrip 6 com prises an elongated longitudinal substrate 3 from which vertically project a plurality of integral, spaced parallel, thin flexible, deformable, wavy S configured fin members 1 . The exposed upper ends of all or any desired lesser number of the fin elements 1 may be partially slit 2 at a desired bias angle to from 20 to 100 of the fin height to control the amount of air and water moisture infiltration through the weatherstrip 6 . The wavy fin weatherstrip 6 assembly may be manufactured by unbalancing an extrusion die so that the rate of plastic flow through the fin forming orifices 20 is substantially greater than that occurring at the base or substrate forming orifice 22 . Alternatively, the extrusion die can be built in sections and by oscillating the fin orifice section 35 relative to a fixed base orifice section 36 , or vice versa, the wavy fin configuration is obtained.
