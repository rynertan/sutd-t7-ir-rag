# Circuits for electromagnet energisation control.

## Abstract
An electromagnet control circuit includes a first switching transistor 14 which is connected in series with the elec tromagnet 10 across a low voltage supply 11, 15 . A second switching transistor 26 is connected to provide a high vol tage supply 27 to the electromagnet at switch on. An induc tor 28 is connected by transistors 30 and 32 to the low voltage supply and is supplied with current whilst the first switching transistor 14 is on. At switch off a diode 29 inter connecting the electromagnet 10 and the inductor 28 allows the inductor current to be diverted through the electromagnet to provide rapid flux decay in the latter.
