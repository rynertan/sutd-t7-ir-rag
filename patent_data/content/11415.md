## Description
Title Film Forming Composition and Vapor Barrier Made Therefrom The present invention relates to a film folding composition which can be utilized to make vapour barrier films suitable for use in building construction and vapor barrier film so formed. Vapor barrier films are specialized products which are commonly used in building construction to retard the transmission of water vapor into or from the interior of the building. They should have a balance of the following characteristics a low water vapor transmission value good flame retardance and low smoke generation properties good low temperature flexibility good tensile and tear strength and easy processibility for such forming operations as calendering, extrusion casting, extrusion blow molding, and solvent casting. One approach to making such films has been the use of an externally plasticized vinyl chloride polymer resin as the polymer component of such films in conjunction with appropiate amounts of flame retardants, fillers, lubricants, stabilizers, and like ingredients e.g., see Film No. 1 in Table 1 of U.S.Patent No. 3,983,290 . Although such films show resistance to water vapor transmission, the presence of externally added plasticizer gives rise to the possibility of plasticizer migration and resulting embrittlement of the product with the passage of time. Another approach to forming such films has been to incoporate chlorinated polyethylene in the polymer component, together with the vinyl chloride polymer, in an eff rt to reduc the amcun of plast needed in the composition. The presence of plasticizer is believed to contribute to water vapor transmission in vapor barrier films see, KogyoKagaku Zasshi, Vol. 64, 349 355 1961 , abstracted in Chem. Abstr., Vol. 57, 4875 f . Some recent examples of vapor barrier film constructions of this type are shown in U.S. Patent No. 3,983,290 Belgian Patent No. 855,443 and U.S. Patent No.3,872,041. The present invention provides a flame retardant, heat stabilized film forming composition containing a polymeric component, said composition being adapted to be used to form a vapor barrier film having low water vapor transmission, good flame retardancy, low smoke generation, and good low temperature flexibility characteristics, char acterised in that the predominant ingredient in said polim,erc component is an internally plasticized vinyl chloride copolymer resin. It also provides a vapor barrier film made from such composition. A preferred internally plasticized resin for use in such a comp sition comprises from about 50 to about 85, by weight, vinyl chloride, from about 3 to 47 , by weight, of a C6 C10 alkyl acrylate, and from about 47 to about 3 , by weight, of a bis hydrocarbyl vinylphosphonate. The film forming composition of the present invention typically comprises the following components a from about 40 to about 70 , by weight of the composition, of a polymer component comprising a predominant amount, for example, in excess of about 45 , by weight of the polymer component, of an internally plasticized resin, which will be described in greater detail below b from about 08 to about 35 , by weight of th composition, of at least one filler material c from about 11 to about 15 , by weight of th composition, of at least one flame retardant and d from about 5 to about 35 , by weight of th composition, of at least one functional additive selected from the group consisting of the heat and ultraviolet stabilizers, lubricants, processing aids, and the like. The major component of the film forming composition is a polymer component which comprises a predor inant amount, e.g., in excess of about 45 , by weight, of an internally plasticized resin, which, when comw bined in an effective amount with the other ingred ients of said composition, yields a composition i. can be used to form a film having such characteristi as low water vapor transmission, good flame retardancy and low smoke generation and good low tempera ture flexibility. One preferred internally plasticized vinyl chloride resin for use in the present invention is a copolymer of 1 from about 50 to about 85, by weight of the copolymer, of vinyl chloride 2 from about 3 to about 47 , by weight of the copolymer, of a C6 C10 alkyl acrylate and 3 from about 47 to about 3 , by weight of the copolymer, of a bis hydrocarby1 vinylphosphonate. Representative C6 C10 alkyl acrylates which can be used in forming the internally plasticized resin which can be used in the compositions of the present invention include n hexyl acrylate, n octyl acrylate, 2 ethylhexyl acrylate, and mixtures of the foregoing acrylates. The Ce Cio alkyl acrylates are preferred fo se, especially those containing branched alkyl groups, for example, 2 ethylhexyl acrylate, since such branched alkyl groups give better physical properties e.g.,low temperature flexibility and good tensile strength to the resulting composition containing the copolymer. The terminology bis hydrocarbyl vinylphosphonate , as used in the present specification, is meant to encompass vinylphosphonates having the formula EMI4.1 where X is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halogen, cyano, aryl, such as phenyl, C1 C1 a kyl and EMI5.1 where R and Rl are hydrocarbyl and substituted hydro carbyl groups consisting essentially of hydrogen and carbon, and containing up to about 18 carbon atoms, inclusive, with the proviso that R and R may be the same, different or conjoint, i.e., R and R may combin to form one single radical. The use, in this disclosure, of the expression hydrocarbyl and substituted hydrocarbyl groups in the definition of the suitable bis hydrocarbyl vinylphosphonates refers to the radicals obtained upon the removal of a hydrogen atom from a hydrocarbon group or substituted hydrocarbon group, which may be either an aliphatic or aromatic group. These hydrocarbyl groups may be substituted with any non interferring groups, i.e., with any group which does not interfere with the polymerization of the bis hydrocarbyl vinyS phosphonate. Such substituent groups include, for example, chloro, bromo, fluoro, nitro, hydroxy, sulfone, ethoxy, methoxy, nitrile, ether, ester, and ketone groups. Illustrative of the aliphatic and aromatic groups as represented by R and R in the abovedescribed structure of the bis hydrocarbyl vinylphosphonate are alkyl groups, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, nonyl, and the like alkenyl groups, such as pentenyl and hexenyl, include ing all of their respective isomers cycloalkyi groups, such as cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopenty cyclohexyl, and the like cycloalkenyl groups, sucn as cyclohexenyl, and the like and aryl groups such as, phenyl, benzyl, phenethyl, tolyl, naphthyl, and tile like. Representative of the above defined bis hydro carbyl vinylphosphates are Bis beta chloroethyl vinylphosphonate Bis 2 ethylhexyl vinylphosphonate Bis beta chloropropyI vi iylphosphonate Bis beta chloroethyl l methyAvinylphosphonatei Bis beta chloroethyl l cyanovinylphosphonate Bie beta chloroethyl l chlorovinylphosphonate Bis beta chloroethyl l phenylvinylphosphonate Dimethyl vinylphosphonate Diethyl vlnylphosphonate Bis omega chlorobutyI vinylphosphonate Di n butyl vinylphosphonate Di isobutyl vinylphosphonate Bis 2 chloroisopropyl 1 methylvinylphosphonate Diphenyl vinylphosphonate and Bus 2,3 dibromopropyl vinylphosphonate From the above group of bis hydrocarbyl vinyl phosphonate monomers, it is preferred to employ bis beta oethyl vinylphosphonate in preparing the internally plasticized polymers used in the compositions of the present invention, since this monomer is a commercially available material and is currently lower in cost than any of the other bis hydrocarbyl vinylphosphonates. Bis 2 ethylhexyl vinylphosphonate is also a preferred monomer since it gives a vinyl film having good flexibility even at very low temperatures. Compatible mixtures of the respective alkyl acrylates and of the vinylphosphonates can be used, if desired. One preferred copolymer for use in the compositions of the present invention, from the standpoint o, cost and performance, is a terpolymer containing from about 55 to about 80 , by weight, of the copolymer of vinyl chloride, from about 10 to about 35, by weight, of the C6 C10 alkyl acrylate, and from about 25 to about 5 , by weight, of a bis C1 C1 2 haloalkatl vinylphosphonate copolymerized therein.One terpolymer which can be used to form films having a Shore A hardness of from about 60 to about 75 contains from about 56 to about 58 , by weight, of vinyl chloride, from about 29 to about 31 , by weight, 2 ethylhexyl acrylate,aid from about 11 to about 13 , by weight, of the vinylphosphonate, e.g., of bis beta chloroethyl vinylphosphonate or of bis 2 ethylhexyl vinylphosphonate. For a harder film having a Shore A hardness of from about 80 to about 90, a higher vinyl chloride content is needed. This is easily accomplished by raising the vinyl chloride monomer content and correspondingly reducing the acrylate and vinylphosphonate monomer content in the polymerization reaction. For example, a terpolymer having a Shore A hardness of from about 85 to about 95 can contain from about 73 to about 75 , by weight.vinyl chloride, from about 17t to about 19 , by eight, of the C6 C10 alkyl acrylate, e.g., 2 ethylhexyl acrylate, and from about 7 to about 9 , by weight of the bis hydrocarbyl vinylphosphonate, e.g., bis beta chloroethyl vinylphosphonate. Terpolymers having a Shore A hardness of from about 85 to about 95 are particularly preferred for use in the composI tions of the present invention when calendering is C be used to form the desired vapor barrier film. The type of internally plasticized copolymer, described above, which is useful in the compositions of the present invention can be formed using conventional bulk, emulsion, suspension, and solution poly merization procedures, Suspension polymerization is preferred since it avoids the problems of isolation o the product from the latex that is produced using emulsion polymerization techniques, the heat of reaction is more readily removed as compared to bulk polymerization procedures, and no solvent recovery is needed as in the solution polymerization. Suspension polymerization reaction mixtures comprise from about 20 to about 45 , by weight, based on the amount of water, of the above enumerated monomers in an aqueous reaction medium. Also included sro from about 0.05 to about 5t, by weight, based on the weight of monomers, of a suspending agent, such as methyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, gelatine, and the like, crom about 0.005 to about 1 , by weight, based on the amount of monomer, of at least one monomersoluble initiator, such as azobisisobutyronitrile, n nlZl peroxide, benzoyl peroxide, or isopropyl peroxydicarbonate.The polymerization reaction is conducted by heating the reaction medium containing the above components to a sufficient temperature and for a sufficient length of time, e.g., from about 350C. to about 75 C. for about 12 hours, to affect the desired polymerization, with agitation being applied throughout the course of the reaction. As is well known in the art, the use of t more active of the above mentioned initiators will require use of either a lower temperature or shorter reaction time, or both, whereas use of a less active initiator may require more vigorous reaction conditions. If desired, the molecular weight of the polymers can be regulated by adding an effective amount of a chain transfer agent during the polymerization.Generally from about 0.01 to about 0.1t, by weight of the monomers, of the chain transfer agent can be added, if desired. Representative.chain transfer agents include the chlorinated hydrocarbons, e.g., tetrachloroethane, trichloroethane and carbon tetrachloride, and mercaptans of the formula RSH, where R is an alkyl group, e.g., a C1 C12 alkyl group, such as butyl or dodecyl. If emulsion polymerization is to be employed, the above described suspending agent is replaced with from about 0.2 to about 2t, by weight, of an emulsifying agent, such as sodium lauryl sulfate, potassium stearate, an alkyl benzene sulfonate, an ammonium dialkyl sulfosuccinate, and the like, and the monomer soluble initiator is replaced with from about 0.1 to about 1 , by weight, of a water soluble initiator, such as an alkali metal persulfate, perborate or peracetate, ammonium persulfate, perborate, a urea peroxide, hydrogen peroxide, tertiary butyl hydroperoxide, and the like. if desired, a redox initiator system, such as ammonium persulfate and sodium bisulfite, or hydrogen peroxide and ascorbic acid, can also be used as the initiator. Polymeriza tion is carried out at similar temperatures and ovcw similar times as those used in suspension polymerize tion. If bulk polymerization is employed, the monomers serve as the solvent and are polymerized in the presence of the above described amounts of the monomer soluble catalysts under the same general temperature and time conditions described above in connection with suspension and emulsion polymerization. If solution polymerization is employed, the mon ormers are polymerized in the presence of at least one inert organic solvent, such as butane, pentane, octane, benzene, toluene, cyclohexanone, acetone, isopropanol, tetrahydrofuran, or the like. The selected initiator should be soluble in the reaction medium. The copolymer can either remain dissolved in the solvent at the end of the polymerization or can be precipitated from the liquid phase during the polymerization. In the former case, the product can he ronovered by evaporation of the solvent or by precipitation of the polymer solution by combining it with a non solvent for the product The same general reaction conditions used in suspension and emulsion polymerization can be used. The internally plasticized resin, once isolated from the desired polymerization reaction medium, can thon be blended with effective amounts of the various other additives that are needed to yield the type of film forming compositions desired for use in making vapor barrier films. It is generally desirable for the compositions to contain an amount of filler which is effective in maintaining the desirable properties of the product while at the same time reducing the need for larger amounts of the other components. Such fillers are pazdad in finely divided form to the compositions in the weight amounts described above. Some representative fillers include talc, calcium carbonate, mica, and clay. The film forming compositions of the present invention also contain an effective amount of at least one flame retardant to aid in giving the composition good flame retardancy and low smoke generation characteristics. The weight range described above for this component 1 15 , by weight of the composition is representative, and this component is preferably added in finely divided form, as well. Some examples of suitable flame retardants are antimony trioxide such as, THERMOGUARD B, from M and T Chemicals magnesium hydroxide such as, S G 84 from theBurns and Russell Co. zinc borate such as ZB 112, from Humphrey Chemical Corp. hydrated alumina aluminum oxide and the like. The film forming compositions of the present invention also desirably contain other functional adi tives which aid in giving the compositions of the present invention the most desirable characteristics.Examples include such well known additives as heat and ultraviolet stabilizers, lubricants, processing aids, pigments, such as titanium dioxide, and the like. Representative heat and ultraviolet stabilizers which may be present at from about 2t to about 10 , by weight of the composition, include octyl epoxy tallate, epoxidized soyabean oil, barium cadmiumzinc complex salts, organic phosphates, and tin and lead containing compounds. Representative lubricants, which can be present at from about 1 to about 7 , by weight of the composition, include stearic acid, calcium stearate, polyethylene and stearamide lubricants. Representative processing aids, which can be present at about 3t to about 25 , by weight of the composition include powdery acrylonitrile butadiene rubber, chlorinated wax, chlorinated polyethylene, thermoplastic polyurethane, and the like. The various components of the film formulation after being combined, can be processed on any conventional mixing apparatus at a sufficiently elevated temperature e.g., 1500C. to 175 C. and then formed into film products which are useful as vapor barrier films using such well known fabrication techniques as calendering, extrusion casting, extrusion blow molding, and solvent casting.
