# Single pole commutation circuit.

## Abstract
A commutation circuit for an inverter using two paral lelly connected main thyristors TH1 TH2 alternately turn ed ON by pulse width modulation PWM for the generation of a fundamental sine wave, uses two separate but coupled primary transformer windings W1 W2 associated with respective positive and negative thyristors with a common secondary winding W6 at the output, and two commutat ing networks for the respective poles, each including an auxiliary thyristor THP THN for fixed commutation and the resonant combination of a capacitor C3 C4 and an inductor L1 L2 . The thyristors, the commutating net works, the DC source, and the output transformer have a symmetrical disposition as well as symmetrical commuta tion steps.
