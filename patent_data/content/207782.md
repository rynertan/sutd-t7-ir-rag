# Novel composition of matter.

## Abstract
A high surface area substrate with controlled pore size and slot geometry is made by depositing at least two mate rials in alternating layers 1,3 . The resulting film is then broken up and one of the materials is etched away to produce a slotted surface structure. These slots 13 can add size and shape selectivity to separations and catalytic processes which because of the uniform and controllable dimension 5A would be superior to that obtainable from zeolites and clays.
