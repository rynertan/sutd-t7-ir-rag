## Description
A Charge Pumping Semiconductor Memory Cell and a Semiconductor Memory Dev Ã¬ c e using such Ce lls This invention relates to a charge pumping semiconductor memory cell and a semiconductor memory device using such cells. This invention is concerned with a so called charge pumping semiconductor memory cell hereinafter referred to as a CP memory cell of which the concept was disclosed in the already allowed US Patent ApplicationSerial No.960917. A CP memory cell is virtually aMIS FET formed in a semiconductor region which is electrically isolated from or floating on a substrate made of a semiconductor or an insulator such as sapphire. If a CP memory cell is an N channel MIS FET, information is written into the CP memory cell when the source is grounded and the drain is supplied with a positive voltage, and then the gate is supplied with a positive voltage which is higher than the threshold voltage of the N channel MIS FET and then the gate voltage is suddenly removed. Since a channel is formed in the semiconductor region under the gate before the gate voltage is suddenly removed, some minority carriers remain confined in the semiconductor region when the gate voltage is suddenly removed. This phenomenon is known as the charge pumping effect. The minority carriers confined in the semiconductor region are effective to charge up the same semiconductor region.As a result, the potential of the semiconductor region shifts from a neutral value. In the case of an N channelMIS FET, the semiconductor region is charged with electrons to a negative potential. The charges electrons remain confined in the semiconductor region under the gate for a considerable length of time, because the region is electrically isolated from or floating on a substrate.Therefore, the semiconductor region is referred to as a charge storage region. Since the above mentioned potential situation is identical to that in which a MIS FET has applied thereto a back gate bias, the threshold voltage of the MIS FET is altered as a result of the back gate effect. In this case N channel , the threshold voltage isincreased. As a result, a condition is available in which the magnitude of gate voltage which would allow the MIS FET to pass a current prior to the charge pumping action or prior to information writing action, will not allow the same transistor to pass a current after the charg e pumping action or the information writing action.This change in characteristics can be utilized for identification of information written in a CP memory cell.Namely, when reading information written in a CP memory cell, a voltage is applied between the source and the drain, while the gate is supplied with a voltage selected from the voltage range between the original threshold voltage of the CP memory cell when memorising a piece of information representing a low level i.e. before or in the absence of charge pumping and the threshold voltage of the CP memory cell .as increased as a result of charge pumping action or information writing action, and the information stored in the cell is picked up in the form of a current. The information written in a CP memory cell can be erased by removing the charge stored in the charge storage region or by supplying a charge of the opposite polarity to the charge stored in the charge storage region. More specifically, various means have been proposed for this purpose as described below. Firstly, information can be erased by writing or irradiating the memory cell with light. In this case, if a number of memory cells are all heated or irradiated information is concurrently erased from all the cells. Secondly, information can be erased by supplying to the gate of a memory cell approximately the same voltage as was applied to write information and by gradually removing that same voltage, so that the charge pumping effect is not caused. In this case, an individual memory cell can be selectively erased of information. Thirdly, information can be erased employing avalanche multiplication. In other words, a fairly high voltage is applied between source and drain of the memory cell so as to cause avalanche multiplication forP N junctions between the charge storage region and the source and drain regions, which results in the release of charge from the charge storage region. Various types of semiconductor memory devices are available which use pluralities of CP memory cells. For example, the performance criteria which are important for a CP memory cell, as a result of the principles which govern the way in which information is written into a CP memory cell, are discussed below.A first important performance criterion is charge pumping efficiency which is defined as the ratio of electric charges recombined with majority carriers contained in the charged storage region and the entire quantity of electric charges injected into the charge storage region at the moment when the gate voltage is suddenly removed. The second important criterion is the charge sustaining time which is defined as the length of the period for which the charges stay inside the charge storage region. The former depends on the quantity or number of recombination centres available in a charge storage region and the latter depends on junction leakage which further depends on crystal quality around P N junctions isolating a charge storage region from other portions of a CP memory cell. When a CP memory cell is formed on an insulator such as sapphire, good charge pumping efficiency is expected as a result of a considerable quantity or number of recombination centres being available in the charge storage region, albeit that charge sustaining time is short. Results of our experiments for such a memory cell show a charge pumping efficiency of approximately 50 , which is fairly good, but a charge sustaining time of 0.3 msec, which is rather bad.When a CP memory cell is formed on a semiconductor substrate, charge pumping efficiency turns out to be extremely bad. Results of our experiments for such a memory cell show a charge pumping efficiency of less than 10 2 , which is extremely bad, but a charge sustaining time of 300 msec 3 sec, which is fairly good. As a result, a CP memory cell formed on a semiconductor substrate is not necessarily appropriate for actual use due to the unsatisfactory magnitude of the charge pumping efficiency. On the other hand, since production cost is extremely high for any SOS type semiconductor device, neither is a CP memory cell formed on an insulator such as a sapphire appropriate for actual use, from the point of view of cost. Further, it is recognised that from the point of view of means of erasing information, a CP memory cell can be inconvenient. It may be clear that means for erasing information employing the avalance multiplication is the most realistic of the different possible means described above. This, however, has a drawback in that two independent power supplies of different voltages are required. A semiconductor memory device employing a plurality of CP memory cells has, of course, the same drawbacks as the individual cells employed. As a result, such a device is not necessarily appropriate for actual use fcr.the reasons given above. According to the present invention there is provided a charge pumping semiconductor memory cell comprising a semiconductor substrate of one conductivity type, a charge storage region, of opposite conductivity type to the semiconductor substrate, on or in the substrate, a source and a drain, on or in the charge storage region, a gate, on a gate insulator layer, on the charge storage region and separating the source and drain, characterised in that a region with an introduced plurality of recombination centres is provided in the charge storage region separate from the source and the drain. A semiconductor memory device embodying this invention and utilising a plurality of such memory cells is also provided. An embodiment of the present invention can provide a CP memory cell formed on a semiconductor substrate which has a good charge pumping efficiency and a long charge sustaining time. An embodiment of the present invention can provide a CP memory cell formed on a semiconductor substrate from which it is easy to erase information employing only one power supply. An embodiment of the present invention can provide a semiconductor memory device which includes CP memory cells formed on a semiconductor substrate and which has a good charge pumping efficiency and a long charge sustaining time. An embodiment of the present invention can provide a semiconductor memory device which includes CP memory cells formed on a semiconductor substrate and from which it is easy to erase information employing only one power supply. In an embodiment of the present invention semiconductor memory cells, each of which virtually is a MIS FET whose threshold voltage varies depending on whether or not information is written therein, whereby the information can be read out in the form of an electric current, is provided. To provide for good charge pumping efficiency and long charge sustaining time, a GP memory cell embodying this invention is provided with a number of recombination centres implanted in the charge storage region. Such recombination centres are implanted in an area to which an inversion layer spreads, leaving a space into which a channel depletion layer can extend. The materials to be implanted are selected from materials which require a lesser or relatively low amount of energy to be deeply implanted into a charge storage region and which have a lesser or relatively low magnitude of diffusion rate, such as oxygen 0 , carbon C , nitrogen N , argon Ar and fluorine F et al.Such recombination centres implanted in a charge storage region which is formed in a semiconductor layer of a good crystal quality are effective in improving charge pumping efficiency without adversely affecting charge sustaining time.As a result, a CP memory cell embodying this invention can exhibit a charge pumping efficiency of approximately 7070 and a charge sustaining time range of 300 msec to 3 sec, depending on crystal condition. To provide for ease of erasing information using only one power supply, a CP memory cell embodying this invention is a type of complementary MIS FET which comprises a CP memory cell proper formed on a semi conductor substrate and having a good charge pumping efficiency and a long charge sustaining time as mentioned above, and a complementary or additional transistor which has a channel of a different conductivity type from that of the CP memory cell proper and the source or drain of which contacts the charge storage region of the CP memory cell proper.The semiconductor substrate and the drain or source of the complementary or additional transistor which does not contact the charge storage region of the CP memory cell proper are supplied withVDD which is usually 5V. The drain of the CP memory cell proper supplied with YSS which is usually ground level.The source of the CP memory cell proper is supplied with VO which is usually a voltage less than 5V. Information is written in the CP memory cell proper when the gates of both CP memory cell proper and the complementary or additional transistor are supplied with VG which is usually 5V, and information is erased when the two gates are both supplied with Vss because the complementary or additional transistor supplies majority carriers to the charge storage region d the CP memory cell proper, as a result returning the electrical potential of the charge storage region of the CP memory cell proper to a neutral position.As a result, information is easily erased without the need for two independent power supplies. To provide a semiconductor memory device with a plurality of CP memory cells of good charge pumping efficiency and long charge sustaining time, a plurality of CP memory cells formed on a semiconductor substrate and having a good charge pumping efficiency and a long charge sustaining time as mentioned above are utilised in accordance with this invention. As a result, the memory device can require much smaller semiconductor chip surface area and can be efficient in writing and sustaining information therein. Further, various circuit configurations simpler than could previously be used can be allowed for in the device. To provide a semiconductor memory device having a plurality of CP memory cells on a semiconductor substrate which are easily erasable using only one power supply, a plurality of complementary MIS FET type CP memory cells which are easily erasable using only one power supply are utilised in the semiconductor memory device. As a result, the device can enjoy various advantages inherent in complementary MIS FET type CP memory cells. Reference is made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a schematic cross sectional view of a part of a semiconductor wafer after completion of a third step in the production of a CP memory cell embodying this invention, formed on a semiconductor substrate and having a good charge pumping efficiency and a long charge sustaining time.

With reference to Figures 1 to 4, steps for production of the arrangement and configuration of, each element of a CP memory cell embodying this invention which is formed on a semiconductor substrate and which has a good charge pumping efficiency and a long charge sustaining time, will be described in relation to a case in which the CP memory cell is produced on an N doped silicon substrate. A first step is to form a silicon oxide layer on a top surface of the substrate to produce a field insulator layer, before an opening for a P type well is etched through the field silicon oxide layer by means of a lithography process. A second step is to form a P type well in the area from which the field silicon oxide layer has been removed. Any conventional method can be used for this step. Referring to Figure 1, a third step is to introduce a number of recombination centres 1 into the P type well 2 formed in the N doped substrate 3, which substrate is covered by a field silicon oxide layer 4 except in an area in which the P type well 2 is formed. The area in which the recombination centres 1 are implanted can be selected anywhere within an area in which an inversion layer is formed in the memory cell when in use.It is clear, however, that such recombination centres must not extend into such areas as would result in disturbance of a channel formed in the memory cell when in use. The materials to be implanted to provide the recombination centres can be selected from those materials which require a lesser or relatively low amount of energy to be implanted to the required depth into the P type well 2 and which have a lesser or relatively low magnitude of diffusion rate. Such materials include oxygen 0 , carbon C , nitrogen N , argon Ar , and fluorine F and the like. Referring to Figure 2, a fourth step is to form a gate insulator layer 5 selectively in isolation on the top surface of P type well 2, and a source 6 and a drain both of which are N doped areas, and are produced by implanting an N dopWn , before a gate 8 provided by a polysilicon polycrystal silicon layer is formed on top of the gate insulator layer 5. A fifth step is to produce terminals not shown which provide ohmic contacts with the source 6, the drain 7, the gate 8, and the substrate 3 respectively, before a passivation layer not shown is formed over the entire surface of the wafer excepting over bonding pads not shown . Referring to Figure 3, a CP memory cell embodying this invention formed on a semiconductor substrate and which is efficient in writing and sustaining information has information written therein in the following manner. The N substrate 3, the source 6 and the drain 7 are respectively supplied with a more positive voltage VDD, for example 5V, a ground voltage Vss, for example OV, and a less positive voltage VO for example 2V. Incidentally, the gate 8 is supplied with a positive voltage VG, for example 5V, before that voltage is suddenly removed.This set of actions causes the charge pumping effect to inject a quantity of electrons into the P type well 2. These pumped electrons are confined for a length of time in the P type well or charge storage region 2 as a result of the presence of a P N junction 9 which is located between the P type well or charge storage region 2, and the substrate 3 and which is reverse biased. The electrons, of course, charge up the P type well or charge storage region 2 to a negative potential, causing a back gate effect to increase the threshold voltage of the CP memory cell. This change in threshold voltage enables the CP memory cell to function as a memory cell. The introduction of a number of recombination centres 1 into the P type well or charge storage region 2 improves charge pumping efficiency, because charge pumping efficiency is defined as the ratio of electron charges recombined with majority carriers holes in this case contained in the P type well or charge storage region 2 to the entire quantity of electric charges confined in or injected into the charge storage region 2. In reality, results of experiments have shown that the charge pumping efficiency can be increased to approximately 70 , for example, from a magnitude of less less than 10 which is the corresponding efficiency for a similar CP cell without the introduction of recombination centres. On the other hand, since the crystal quality of the P type well 2 is f r,, junction leakage across the P N junction 9 is very small. Therefore, charge sustaining time is also fair. In reality, results of experiments have shown that charge substanting time can be maintained in the range 300msec 3sec for example. As a result a CP memory cell formed on a semiconductor substrate and embodying this invention has a good charge pumping efficiency and a long charge sustaining time. Of course, this invention can be employed in various different ways. One example of another embodiment is illustrated in Figure 4. The difference between the first embodiment described above with reference to Figures 1 to 3 and the second embodiment in Figure 4, predominantly relates to the production methods used. Namely, for the embodiment of Figure 4, after a P silicon layer 2 has been formed in an N doped silicon substrate 3, a silicon dioxide layer 4 is formed on the surface of the substrate 3 and an opening for a charge storage region 2 is etched through layer 4 , before a P silicon layer 2 is formed on the P silicon layer 2 and on the silicon dioxide layer 4 . Then, after the P silicon layer 2 has been oxidised to provide oxide layer 4 except in an area in which a CP memory cell is to be formed, recombination centres 1 are implanted into layer 2 by means employing a resist mask. After the resist mask has been removed, a gate insulator layer 5 and a gate 8 are formed, before N dopant is implanted to form an N source 6 and and an N drain 7 as shown inFigure 4. With reference to Figures 5 to 7, the arrangement and configuration of each element of a CP memory cell embodying this invention which allows easy erasure of information without requiring two independent power supplies will be described below, in relation to a case in which a CP memory cell is produced in a P type well formed in an N doped silicon substrate. Referring to Figure 5, a number of recombination centres 1 are implanted in a P type well or charge storage region 2 formed in an N doped substrate 3. On a top surface of the P type well or charge storage region 2, a source 6 and a drain 7, both of which are provided by N doped areas, are provided surrounding a gate 8.A P channel transistor is formed in the same N doped substrate 3, and an additional drain 10 of the P channel transistor is arranged across a P N junction 9 which isolates the P type well or charge storage region 2 from the substrate 3. An additional source 11 of the P channel transistor is provided at the surface of the N doped substrate 3. An additional gate 12 is arranged to separate the additional drain 10 and the additional source 11. The gates 8 and 12 may be connected to one another see below . Referring again to Figure 5, a CP memory cell embodying this invention which allows easy erasure of information using only one power supply has information written therein in the same manner as for the CP memory cell described above with reference to Figures 1 to 3.Namely, the N substrate 3, the source 6 and the drain 7 are respectively supplied with a more positive voltage VDD, for example 5V, a ground voltage Vss, for example and a less positive voltage VO, for example 2V.Incidentally, both gates 8 and 12 are supplied with a positive voltage VG, for example 5V. This potential position causes the CP memory cell proper 18 to form a channel in the P type well or charge storage region 2, while the complementary or additional transistor 19 is kept in an OFF condition.Thereafter, when the gate voltage is suddenly removed, an item of information is written in the CP memory cell proper 18 as a result of the charge pumping effect.Needless to say, a good charge pumping efficiency and a long charge sustaining time are expected respectively because of the existance of a number of recombination centres 1 implanted in the charge storage region 2, and the good crystal quality of the charge storage region 2. To read information, the gate 8 is supplied with a voltage selected from the voltage range between the original threshold voltage of the CP memory cell when memorising a piece of information representing a low level ie.before or in the absence of charge pumping and the threshold level of the CP memory cell proper 18 as increased after an information writing action i.e. after charge pumping , for example 2.5V.A voltage in this range is used so as to keep the CP memory cell proper 18 in an OFF condition. Otherwise, it would be impossible to retain a piece of stored information. On the other hand, the gate 12 is supplied with a positive voltage, for example 5V. This is to keep the complementary or additional transistor 19 in an OFF condition. However, in a case in which the complementary or additional transistor 19 is so produced as to have a threshold voltage such that the same transistor 19 would not be shifted to an ON position by the application to the gate 12 of the voltage to be applied to the gate 8 of the CP memory cell proper 18 for reading information, the gate 8 and the gate 12 can accept the same voltage for reading information.As a result, gates 8 and 12 can be permanently connected. This is, of course, effective in simplifying wiring configuration. To erase information, both gates 8 and 12 are supplied with a zero voltage, causing the complementary transistor 19 to be placed in an ON condition. This causes the additional drain .10 to be supplied with a number of positive charges or holes. Since the additional drain 10 and the P type well or charge storage region 2 are at the same potential, theP type well or charge storage region 2 is resultantly supplied with a considerable quantity of positive charges and is returned to a neutral potential. This of course returns the threshold voltage of the CP cell proper to its original value, or a value which corresponds to a condition of the cell in which no information is written therein i.e before or in the absence of charge pumping .This means that the information can be erased by application of a zero voltage. As a result, in accordance with this invention, a CP memory cell in which erasure of information is. facilitated without the need for two independent power supplies of two different magnitudes of voltage is provided. This invention can be embodied in various different ways. A further embodiment is illustrated in Figure 6.The difference between the embodiment of Figure 5 described above and the embodiment of Figure 6 is that the additional gate 12 is formed in self alignment with P N junction 9 and additional drain 10 is eliminated. The additional drain 10 of the embodiment of Figure 5 has no terminal and is at the same potential as the P type well or charge storage region 2. This means that the additional drain 10 can be eliminated, using the P type well or charge storage region 2 as a drain for the complementary or additional transistor 19. The function of the embodiment of Figure 6 is precisely identical to that of the embodiment of Figure 5. Another embodiment is illustrated in Figure 7.The difference between the embodiment of Figure 5 described above and the embodiment of Figure 7 is that the additional source 11 of the complementary or additional transistor 19 is supplied with a positive voltage VDD from a terminal connected with the substrate 3 through an N silicon region 13 and wiring 14 connecting the N silicon region 13 and the additional source 11. This allows the elimination of a terminal for the additional source 11. A combination of the embodiments of Figure 6 and 7 can be provided. With reference to Figures 8 and 9, the wiring and the function of a semiconductor memory device embodying this invention which utilises CP memory cells each of which is formed on a semiconductor substrate and each of which has a good charge pumping efficiency and a long charge sustaining time, will be described. In Figure 8, each of a number of word lines 20 is connected with the gates 21 of a number of CP memory cells in a respective row. Each of a number of bit lines 22 is connected with the drains 23 of a number of CP memory cells in a respective column. All the sources 24 of the CP memory cells are grounded. Each of the bit lines 22 is provided with a switching element 25, regulated by a column decoder 26 for selection of an arbitrary column, and which is connected with an input output terminal 27. All of the bit lines 22 are commonly connected through a common load 29 with an input output control switching element 28 and a positive voltage power supply terminal 30. The semiconductor memory device is provided with control units for selection of an arbitrary one of the word lines 20 and refreshment of the memory. When a piece of information is written in the semiconductor memory device, one of the bit lines 22 is selected and one of the word lines 20 is selected, and then the selected word line has applied thereto a positive voltage and is then suddenly released from that voltage, to cause the charge pumping effect. On the other hand, when a piece of information is read out of the semiconductor memory device, one of the word lines 20 is selected and one of the bit lines 22 is selected in accordance with an address, and then the selected word line 20 is supplied with a positive voltage. If a piece of information 1 is memorized in the addressed CP memdry cell, a current signal flows out of the input output terminal 27, because the CP memory cell refuses to pass a current. If apiece of information 0 is memorized in the CP memory cell, no current flows out of the input output terminal 27, because the CP memory cell will pass a current which flows to earth. Since each of the CP memory cells has a good charge pumping efficiency and a long charge sustaining time, a semiconductor memory device which is efficient in writing and sustaining information is provided, in accordance with this invention. In addition, cost advantage can be significant. Figure 9 shows another example of the wiring in a semiconductor memory device embodying this invention utilizing CP memory cells each of which is formed ana semiconductor substrate and each of each has a good charge pumping efficiency and a long charge sustaining time. It is noted that this wiring is particularly applicable to CP memory cells. Similar elements are given the same reference numerals as employed in Figure 8. The function and the features of the wiring of Figure 9 are similar to those of the wiring shown in Figure 8. With reference to Figure 10, the wiring and the function of a semiconductor memory devide embodying this invention which utilizes CP memory cells which are easy to erase using only one power supply will be described. Referring to Figures 5 and 10, each of the word lines 20 in Figure 10 is connected with gates 8 of all the CP memory cells proper 18 and the additional gates 12 of all the complementary or additional transistors 19 in a respective row Each of the bit lines 22 is connected with the drains 7 of all the CP memory cells proper 18 included in a respective column.All the sources 6 of the CP memory cells proper 18 are grounded. Each of VDD lines 22 is connected with the additional drains 11 of all the complementary or additional transistors 19 and the substrate 3. Each . of the VSS lines 22 is connected with the sources of the CP memory cells proper. Each of the bit lines 22 is provided with a switching element 25 for selection of an arbitrary column. The switching elements 25 are commonly connected with an input output terminal 27 through a sense amplifier 28. The functions of the semiconductor memory device embodying this invention which utilizes CP memory cells from which it is easy to erase information employing only one power supply whose wiring is as shown in Fifure 10 are quite similar to the others. The only difference is that the information is to written inLa specific memory cell, when the gates 8 and 12 of the specific memory cell are supplied with a positive voltage VG, and that information is easily erased from a specific memory cell, when the gates 8 and 12 of the specific memory cell are supplied with a zero voltage Vss, without requiring two independent power supplies of different potentials. The functions of a so called charge pumping semiconductor memory cell depend on the charge pumping efficiency and on the charge sustaining time, both of which further depend on the crystal quality of a semiconductor region where the charges are stored a charge storage region . In embodiments of this invention a number of recombination centres are interleaved or implanted in a charge storage region of good crystal quality, which effectively improves both of the above mentioned parameters. An additional transistor with a channel of the opposite conductivity type to. the CP memory cell proper which is formed on the same substrate in such a way that its drain contacts the charge storage region of the CP memory cell proper can provide for effective erasure of information written into,the so called charge pumping CP semiconductor memory cell, when the gates of both the additional transistor and of the CP memory cell proper are connected together and the additional transistor is ON while the memory cell proper is OFF.
