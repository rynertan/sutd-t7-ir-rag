## Description
This invention relates to novel aromatic poly ether ketones having imide, amide, ester, azo, quinoxalsine, benzimidazole, benzoxazole, or benzothiazole groups and to methods for their preparation, particularly to electrophilic polymerization in the presence of a Lewis acid and a complex between a Lewis acid component and a Lewis base component and, optionally, a diluent Aromatic poly ether ketones , in particular those wherein the aromatic groups are all para linked, possess many desirable properties, for example, high temperature stability, mechanical strength, and resistance towards common solvents. Unlike many other high temperature stable polymers, they are melt processable on conventional euqipment. It has now been discovered that the incorporation of imide, amide, ester, azo, quinoxaline, benzimidazole, benzoxazole, or benzothiazole groups into an aromatic poly ether ketone results in a polymer having surprisingly superior properties over known aromatic polyfether ketones .Further, the resulting polymer has unexpectedly superior properties or processability compared to aromatic polymers having imide, amide, ester, azo, quinoxaline, benzimidazole, benzoxazole, or benzothiazole groups. Methods for preparing aromatic poly ether ketones having functional groups such as amide, ester, imide, azo, benzimidazole, benzothiazole, benzoxazole, quinoxaline, and the like have also been discovered. Aromatic poly ether ketones can be prepared by FriedelCrafts synthesis in which an aryl ketone linkage is formed from a carboxylic acid halide and an aromatic compound having an activated hydrogen, i.e., a hydrogen atom displaceable under the electrophilic reaction conditions. The monomer system employed in the reaction can be, for example, a a single aromatic compound containing a carboxylic acid halide as well as an aromatic carbon bearing a hydrogen activated towards electrophilic substitution or b a twomonomer system of a dicarboxylic acid dihalide and an aromatic compound containing two such activated hydrogens. A common medium for such Friedel Crafts reactions consists of the reactant s , a catalyst, such as anhydrous aluminum chloride, and an inert solvent such as methylene chloride. Because carbonyl groups complex with aluminum trichloride and thereby deactivate it, the aluminum chloride catalyst is generally employed in the preparation of arylene ketones in an amount slightly more than one equivalent for each equivalent of carbonyl groups in the reaction medium.The slight excess assures that enough free aluminum chloride will be present to fulfill its catalytic role. Other metal halides such as ferric chloride may be employed as the catalyst, but generally with less satisfactory results. This invention provides polymers comprising a repeat unitEMI3.1 wherein R1 is independently p phenylene or 4,4 biphenylene R2 IsEMI3.2 R1 X R3 EMI3.3 EMI4.1 R3 is independently C1 to C12 alkylene or fluorinated alkylene or substituted or unsubstituted p phenylene, m phenylene, 1,4naphthylene, 2, 6 naphthylene, 2,6 pyridinediyl, 2,5 pyridinediyl, or EMI5.1 R4 is substituted or unsubstitutedEMI5.2 R5 is independently substituted or unsubstitutedEMI5.3 X is independently ester, amide, or azo Y is independentlyEMI6.1 A is independently ether, ketone, sulfone, C1 to C12 alkylene or fluorinated alkylene, thioether, hexafluoroisopropylidene, isopropylidene, or a direct bond Z is independently hydrogen, phenyl, or lower alkyl and n is 1 or 2. According to another aspect of this invention, there is provided a process for preparing aromatic poly ether ketones having an side, anide, ester, azo, quinoxaline, benzimidazole, benzoxazole, or benzothiazole group, comprising polymerizing a monomer system selected fan the group consisting of I a self polymerizing monomer having a carboxylic acid halide group, a hydrogen activated towards electLuyhilic substitution, and an imide, amide, ester, azo, quinoxaline, benzimidazole, benzoxazole, or benzothiazole group II substantially stoichiometric amounts of an aromatic dicarboxylic acid dihalide and an aranatic compound having two hydrogens activated towards electrophilic substitution, proyided at least one of said acid dihalide and said aranatic compound has an imide, anide, ester, azo, quinoxaline, benz imidazole, benzoxa zole, or benzothiazole group and III oombinations of the above in a reaction medium comprising A a Lewis base in an amunt from 0.01 to 4 equivalents per equivalent of acid halide groups present in said monomer system B a Lewis acid in an amount of about one equivalent per equivalent of carbonyl groups present plus one equivalent per equivalent of Lewis base, plus an amount effective to act as a catalyst for said polymerization and C a Kxrprotic diluent in an amount fran 0 to 93 percent by weight, based on the weight of the total reaction mixture. This invention provides aranatic poly ether ketones having imide, anide, ester, azo, quinoxaline, benzimidazole, benzoxazole, or benzothiazole groups. A preferred method for making these polymers isFriedel Crafts polymerization, in which the polymerization step consists of the reaction of a carboxylic acid halide with an aranatic group having a hydrogen activated towards electrophilic substitution to form a diaryl ketone. Particularly preferred is Friedel Crafts polymerization in the presence of excess Lewis acid and a complex between a Lewis acid and a Lewis base. Monomer systems suitable for the preparation of the polymers of this invention by Friedel Crafts polymerization are of two general types. The first, which will be called the one monomer system, comprises an aromatic compound having both a carboxylic acid halide and a hydrogen atom activated towards electrophilic substitution. Such a monomer is called an EN monomer because it has both an electrophillic group the carboxylic acid halide and a nucleophilic group the aromatic group having the activated hydrogen . The following examples of EN monomers are illustrative but not exhaustive EMI9.1 where X is independently anide, ester, or azo and where Y is independentlyEMI10.1 where 2 is independently hydrogen, phenyl, or lower alkyl. Polymers of this invention which can be prepared from EN monomers include, for example EMI11.1 The second monomer system, which will be called the two monomer system, comprises a dicarboxylic acid dihalide and an aromatic capon having two hydrogen atoms activated towards electrophilic substitution. In keeping with the above shorthand notation, these are called the E.and NN nronanersr respectively. Where a high degree of polymerization is desired, the EE and NN monomers should be present in substantially stoichianetric amounts.Illustrative but not exhaustive examples of EE monomers are EMI12.1 EMI13.1 where X and Y are as hereinbefore defined and A is independently ether, ketone, sulfone, C1 to C12 alkylene or fluorinated alkylene, thioether, isopropylidene, hexafluoroisopropylidene, or a direct bond and whereEMI14.1 denotes meta or para phenylene. Illustrative but not exhaustive examples of NN mowers are EMI14.2 EMI14.3 EMI15.1 where A, X, and Y are as hereinbefore defined. It is evident that if an EE monomer having no X or Y groups is selected, it should be polymerized with an NN monomer having an X or Y group, and vice versa.Alternatively, both EE and NN can have an X or Y group.Examples of polymers which can be prepared in such a manner includeEMI16.1 In the preceding illustrations of suitable monomers, the carboxylic acid halides were consistently represented as the chloride as a matter of convenience. It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the acid fluoride and the acid bromide are also suitable. Also, as a matter of convenience, aromatic rings have been drawn as unsubstituted, although it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that they may have one or more substituents which are inert under the polymerization conditions and which do not interfere with the polymerization. Examples of such substituents include lower alkyl, particularly methyl cyano halogen, particularly fluoro, bromo and chloro nitro and benzoyl.Substituents forming crosslinkes or branches under the polymerization conditions should be avoided unless crosslinked or branched polymer is desired. Finally, it should be cautioned that substitution is generally undesirable on a ring containing a hydrogen activated toward electrophilic substitution, as substituents tend to interfere with the polymerization. It is contemplated that the polymers of this invention include copolymers. For example, two or more different EN monomers may be copolymerized. Or a single EE monomer can be copolymerized with two or more different NN monomers. Or one or more EN monomers can be polymerized with combinations of El and NN monomers. To illustrate,EMI17.1 andEMI18.1 may be copolymerized to yield a copolymer with the repeat unitsEMI18.2 andEMI19.1 Furthermore, it is also contemplated that the polymers of this invention include copolymers with prior art poly ether ketones .Among the latter, the repeat units of particular interest for incorporation into copolymers areEMI19.2 EMI20.1 The synthesis of these prior art poly ether ketones is described in Bonner, U.S. Pat. 3,065,205 Dahl, U.S. Pat. 3,953,400 Dahl et al,U.S. Pat. 3,956,240 and Jansons et al., PCT Application WO 84 03891.To illustrate, EMI21.1 EMI21.2 andEMI21.3 can be copolymerized to yield a oopolymer with the repeat unitsEMI22.1 andEMI22.2 As with other electrophilic polymerizations, the mcnsmer s used should be relatively free of any impurities which would interfere with the polymerization. As used in this specification, a hydrogen activated towards electrophilic substitution is a hydrogen bonded to an aromatic carbon atom and displaceable by an acyl group under the well known conditions for Friedel Crafts acylation to occur. In particular, it is displaceable under the reaction conditions of this invention. A hydrogen is activated for a Friedel Crafts reaction by the presence of an electron donating group ortho or para to it. Particularly desirable activated hydrogen bearing aranatic moieties are phenoxy C6H50 and p biphenyloxy C6H5 p C6H4 0 . Those skilled in the art will readily realize that in FriedelCrafts acylations and polymerizations, involving, for example, the phenoxy group, reaction may take place at one of three positions either of the two ortho positions or the para position. Hbwever, once one acylation has occurred, the just introduced acyl group exerts a deactivating effect which inhibits further reaction in the phenoxy group. Thus, for stoichiametric purposes, a phenoxy group is deemed to have only one activated hydrogen. It has been our experience that reaction generally takes place at the para position i.e., it is the para hydrogen that is activated , particularly where the polymerization is run in the presence of a Lewis acid and a complex between a Lewis acid and a Lewis base, as taught hereinafter. A preferred process for preparing the polymers of the instant invention comprises the use of a reaction medium comprising free Lewis acid and a complex between a Lewis acid and a Lewis base and, optionally, a diluent. The term complex is used to mean any product of the reaction between the Lewis acid and the Lewis base. A diluent is employed if the complex is a solid at polymerization temperatures and can be present, if desired, when the complex is liquid. The term Lewis acid is used herein to refer to a substance which can accept an unshared electron pair frcm another molecular. Lewis acids which can be used in the practice of this invention include, for example, aluminum trichloride, aluminum tribranide, antimony pentachloride, antimony pentafluoride, indium trichloride, galliun trichloride, boron trichloride, boron trifluoride, zinc chloride, ferric chloride, stannic chloride, titanium tetrachloride, and molybdenun pentachloride. The use of substantially anhydrous aluninun trichloride as the Lewis acid is preferred. The amount of Lewis acid used in the practice of this invention varies depending on the particular monomers and reaction medium selected. In all instances at least about one equivalent of Lewis acid per equivalent of carbonyl groups present in the monomer system is used plus an amount effective to act as a catalyst for the reaction also referred to herein as a catalytic amount . Generally a catalytic amount added is from about 0.05 to about 0.3 equivalents ofLewis acid per equivalent of acid halide in the reaction mixture.Additional amounts of Lewis acid are also required depending on the nature of the monomers and the reaction conditions in a manner as set forth below. Further, if a comoncmer containing other basic species is used, additional Lewis acid may be required. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the reaction is controlled by the addition of a controlling agent which, inter alia, suppresses undesirable side reactions, particularly alkylation and or ortho substitution of activated aryl groups. Suppression of side reactions results in polymer that can that will be more readily melt processable because it will be less likely to degrade or cross link when subjected to elevated temperatures, e.g. temperatures above its melting point. For a polymer of this type to be suitable for melt processing, it rtust be able to withstand the processing temperatures for the required processing time.Typically these conditions require that the polymer can withstand temperatures up to about 300C above the melting or softening point of the polymer for periods of at least 30 minutes, preferably at least 60 minutes and most preferably at least 90 minutes, without undesired gel formation or substantial change in inherent viscosity. Preferred controlling agents for the polymerization are Lewis bases. The term Lewis base is used herein to refer to a substance capable of donating an unshared electron pair to a Lewis acid. Thus, the Lewis base forms a complex with the Lewis acid used in the reaction medium. It has been found that Lewis bases which form a 1 1 complex having a heat of association at least about that of diphenyl ether with the Lewis acid are preferred. For example, where aluninun trichloride is the Lewis acid the Lewis base used should form a 1 1 complex having a heat of association of at least about 15 kcal male, preferably at least about 20 kcalvmole and most preferably at least about 30 kcal mole.While the heats of association are for a 1 1Lewis acid Lewis base complex consisting solely of these two components, the actual complex formed in the reaction medium need not be a 1 1 complex. A discussion on heats of association for Lewis acid Lewis base complex is found in J. Chem Soc. A , 1971, pages 3132 3135 D.E.H. Jones et al . The Lewis base used should not be an acylating, alkylating or arylating agent nor should it be acylatable under the reaction conditions. Mixtures of two or more Lewis bases can be used if desired. The Lewis base used as a controlling agent in the practice of this invention is an additional component added to the reaction medium. This does not include basic species formed in situ during the reaction. Typical Lewis bases which can be employed include, for example, amides, nines, esters, ethers, ketones, nitriles, nitro compounds, phosphines, phosphine oxides, phosphoramides, sulfides, sulfones, sulfonamides, sulfoxides and halide salts. Examples of specific organic Lewis bases that can be used in the practice of this invention are acetone, benzophenone, cyclohexanone, methyl acetate, ethylene carbonate, N methyl formamide, acetanide,N,N dimethylacetamide, N methylpyrrol idone, urea, tetramethylurea, N acetylmorpholine, dimethyl sulfide, N, N d iinethyl formnide, d iphenyl sulfone, N,N dimethylmethane sulfonamide, phosphoryl chloride, phenyiphosphonyl chloride, pyridine N oxide, triphenylphosphine oxide, trioctylphosphine oxide, nitropropane, nitrobenzene, benzonitrile, n butyronitrile, methyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dimethyl sulfide, trimethylamine, N,N,N ,N tetranethylethylened i anine , N,N dimethyldodecylamine, imidazole, pyridine, quinol ine, isoquinoline, benzimidazole, 2,2 bipyridine, o phenanthroline, 4 dimethylaminopyridine, and the like. In addition to covalent organic compounds, suitable Lewis bases include inorganic salts which can form complexes with Lewis acids, for example, chlorides, such as trimethylammonium chloride, tetramethylammonium chloride, sodium chloride or lithium chloride, perchlorates, trifluoro methanesulfonates and the like. Preferred Lewis bases for the reaction medium of this invention are N methylformamide, N, N d imethyl formunide, N, N d imethylacetamide, 1 methyl 2 pyrrolidone, tetramethylene sulfone also known as sulfolane , n butyroni trile, dimethyl sulfide, imidazole, acetone, benzophenone, trimethylamine, trimethylamine hydrochloride, tetrnethyl aoonitin chloride, pyridine N oxide, 1 ethylpyridinium chloride, lithium chloride, lithium bromide, sodiun chloride, sodium bromide, potassium chloride, potassium bromide and mixtures thereof. The amount of Lewis base present should be fran 0.01 to about 4 equivalents per equivalent of acid halide groups present in the monomer systan. Preferably at least about 0.05 and most preferably at least about 0.5 equivalents of Lewis base per equivalent of acid halide groups present should be used. Amounts greater than 4 equivalents could be employed, if desired. However, no additional controlling effect is usually achieved by adding larger amounts.Thus, it is preferred to use no more than about 4 equivalents and generally about 2 equivalents. The particular amount of Lewis base added depends to a certain extent on the nature of the monomers present. The temperature at which the reaction is conducted can be from about 500C to about 1500C. It is preferred to start the reaction at lower temperatures, for example at about 50 to about 100C particularly if the monomer system contains highly reactive monomers. After reaction has commenced, the temperature can be raised if desired, up to 150 C or even higher, for example, to increase the rate of reaction. It is generally preferred to carry out the reaction at temperatures in the range of between about 300C and 250C room temperature . While it is not understood exactly how the Lewis base acts to control the reaction, it is believed that one or more of the following factors may be involved. The Lewis acid Lewis base complex appears to influence the catalytic activity of Lewis acid, so as to substantially eliminate all ortho or meta acylation. If a diluent such as methylene chloride or dichloroethane is used, the Lewis acid Lewis base complex substantially reduces the tendency of the diluent to act as an alkylating agent by carpeting with the diluent for available Lewis acid and thereby suppressing alkylation of.the polymer. Alkylation of the polymer in the para position caps the reaction while alkylation in the ortho position introduces s undesired reactive sites in the polymer chain which can lead to branching or cross linking. A non protic diluent can also be employed, if desired.Advantageously, the diluent should dissolve the Lewis acid Lewis base complex and the resulting oliganer Lewis acid complex but this is not an essential requirement of the diluent. It should also be relatively inert toward Friedel Crafts react ions. The diluent is used in an amount fran 0 to about 93 by weight, based on the weight of the total reaction mixture. As is known in reactions of this type, the reactions can be run neat, that is without the presence of a diluent. This is true for the process of this invention whether or not a Lewis base is used. As discussed in more detail below, it has been found that the monomer to diluent molar ratio can contribute to control of the reaction to yield the desired product. Use of an alkylating or acylating diluent can lead to undesired side reactions as mentioned above. When such solvents are employed control of the reaction by techniques taught in this specification suppresses such alkylation or arylation. The result is a thermally stable, essentially linear polymer. A most useful and unexpected aspect of the process described hereinbefore is that it enables the polymerization of phenyl esters, for example bis 4 phenoxyphenyl terephthalate. Ordinarily, phenyl and other aromatic esters undergo the Fries rearrangement in the presence of a Lewis acid, particularly aluminum chloride. However, under the reaction conditions described, high molecular weight polymer, with no evidence of any Fries rearrangement having occurred, are obtained. If desired, the molecular weight of the polymer, the degree of branching and amount of gelation can be controlled by the use of, for exanple, capping agents as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,247,682 to nahl, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.The molecular weight of the polymer can also be controlled by a reaction utilizing a twcrmcnomer system as described above, by employing a slight excess of one of the monomers. Capping agents, when employed, are added to the reaction mediun to cap the polymer on at least one end of the chain. This terminates continued growth of that chain and controls the resulting molecular weight of the polymer, as shown by the inherent viscosity of the polymer. Judicious use of the capping agents results in a polymer within a selected narrow molecular weight range, decreased gel formation during polymerization, and decreased branching of the polymer chains and increases melt stability. Both nucleophilic and electrophilic capping agents can be used to cap the polymer at each end of the chain. Preferred nucleophlic capping agents are 4 phenoxybenzophenone, 4 4 phenoxyphenoxy benzophenone, 4,4 d iphenoxybenzophenone, and the like. Typical electrophilic capping agents are compounds of the formulaEMI31.1 wherein Ar is phenyl, 3 chlorophenyl, 4 chlorophenyl, 4 cyanophemyl, 4 methylphenyl or an aromatic group substituted with an electron withdrawing substituent and E is halogen or other leaving group.Preferred electrophilic capping agents include benzoyl chloride, benzenesulfonyl chloride and the like. Decomplexation of the polymer from the catalyst can be accomplished by treating the reaction mixture with a decomplexing base after completion of polymerization. The base can be added to the reaction medium or the reaction medium can be added to the base. The decomplexing base rust be at least as basic towards the Lewis acid as the basic groups on the polymer chain. Such decomplexation should be effected before isolation of the polymer from the reaction mixture. The amount of decomplexing base used should be in excess of the total amount of bound catplexed and unbound Lewis acid present in the reaction mixture and is preferably twice the total amount of Lewis acid. Typical decomplexing bases which can be used include water, dilute aqueous hydrochloric acid, methanol, ethanol, acetone, N,N dimethyl forminide, N,N dimethylacet iide, pyridine, dimethyl ether, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, trimethylini ne, trimethylamine hydrochloride, dimethyl sulfide, tetramethylenesulfone, benzophenooe, tetramethylammonium chloride, isopropanol and the like.The decomplexed polymer can then be removed by conventional techniques such as adding a nonsolvent for the polymer which is a solvent for or miscible with the Lewis acid Lewis base complex and the Lewis acid spraying the reaction mediun into a non solvent for the polymer separating the polymer by filtration or evaporating the volatiles fran the reaction medium and then washing with an appropriate solvent to remove any remaining base catalyst complex and diluent from the polymer. A method for removing the catalyst residue is described inDahl, U.S. Patent No. 4,239,884, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference. The polymers of this invention can be used in any number of ways.Because of their predominantly or wholly aromatic nature, they possess outstanding thermal stability, as evidenced by their thermogravimetric TGA 1 weight loss temperatures being generally above 4000C and often above 5000C. They also possess superior mechanical properties, which are retained at elevated temperatures in view of their glass transition temperatures Tg s of above 1500C. Furthermore, many of these polymers are crystalline, also contributing to the maintenance of mechanical properties at elevated temperatures. Also, they possess resistance to many ccmmon solvents. Thus, the polymers of this invention are particularly suitable for use in those applications generally reserved for the so called heat stable or high performance polymers. The polymers of this invention, particularly the high molecular weight ones, can be used in films, filaments, electrical insulation, coatings, molded articles, and like applications. Generally, conventional fabrication techniques such as injection molding and extrusion can be used. By high molecular weight polymer we mean one having an inherent viscosity of 0.6 or greater. While the process of this invention is particularly suitable for the preparation of high molecular weight polymers, low molecular weight polymers which may be desirable for certain applications can readily be prepared, for example by appropriate use of a capping agent or stdibhiametric imbalance. The lower molecular weight polymers may be desirable for certain applications, such as adhesives or as powder coatings. The following examples illustrate the preparation of the polymers of this invention. It is to be understood that other reactants, reaction media, and monomers within the scope of the teaching of this invention can be employed, if desired. Reduced viscosity RV or inherent viscosity rev refer to the mean reduced viscosity or inherent viscosity, as is the case, as detennined according to the method of Sorenson et al., Preparative Methods of Polymer Chemistry, 2nd Ed., Interscience 1968 , p. 44. c 0.1 g of polymer dissolved in 100 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid at 250C, unless noted otherwise. Purities by differential scanning calorimetry D6C were estimated as described in Palermo et al., Themochim. Acta, 14, 1 1976 and Marti, Thermochim. Acta 5, 173 1972 . Example 1 The bis amide of p phenylene di ine with p phenoxybenzoic acid was prepared as follows. A slurry of p phenylene dianine 16.22 g, 0.15 mole, differential scanning calorimetry tSC purity 99.99 in N,N dimethylacetamide tDMAC, ca. 300 mL was added to a solution of p phenoxybenzoyl chloride 69.80 g, 0.30 mole in DMAc 250 mL over a 5 min period at 250C. The mixture was allowed to warm to roan temperature and stirred for about 3 days. The reaction mixture, consisting of a pale purple powder in a purple solution, was poured into water 3000 mL . The insoluble material was filtered, washed with water, and dried at 100 under a vacuum. After decolorization with activated charcoal and two recrystallizations from water DMAc, 11.75 g of product was obtained.It had a rrp of 322.5 323.50C and was shown to be 99.93 pure by D6C.Its 300 MHz 1H NMR spectrum was consistent with the expected structure.Example 2 N,N Dimethylformamide DMF, 2.3 mL, 2.19 g, 0.03 mole was added with stirring and cooling to a mixture of aluninun chloride 10.3 g, 0.077 mole in methylene chloride 50 mL . The bis amide prepared inExample 1 5.0032 g, 0.01000 mole was then added. The mixture was cooled to 6 C and terephthalcyl chloride 2.03C g, 0.009998 mole was added, with stirring.
