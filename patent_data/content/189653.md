# AN ELECTRICALLY CONDUCTIVE COATING COMPOSITION OF A GLYCIDYL ACRYLIC POLYMER AND A REACTIVE POLYSILOXANE

## Abstract
A coating composition has a liquid carrier and a binder of a blend of a. an acrylic polymer containing glycidyl groups and b. a crosslinkable polysiloxane having attached to the silicone atoms of its backbone alkyl groups, phenyl groups and hydroxyl groups. The composition contains electrically conductive pig ments such as carbon black and graphite to provide an electrically conductive dry film, and may be used on lead alloy grids of lead acid storage batteries to prolong the life of the battery, or to reduce the size and weight of the battery.
