# Inorganic adsorbent, production thereof and use thereof.

## Abstract
An inorganic adsorbent comprising a porous titanium metal and titanium oxide sintered and impregnated on the surfaces of micropores of the porous titanium metal can be produced by impregnating the porous titanium metal with a titanium alkoxide solution, followed by hydrolysis and oxidation to give titanium oxide, and can be used for selectively removing transition metal ions in a water coolant of nuclear reactor.
