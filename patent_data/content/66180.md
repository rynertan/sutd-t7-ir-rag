# Optically coupled bidirectional transceiver.

## Abstract
The invention provides a transceiver 10 for bidirectional optical communication between two devices. A first output signal from the first device 12 is input to the transceiver. Using parallel optical data links 16, 18 , an optical signal is generated 17, 19 in response to the first signal and is detected by a pair of light sensitive devices which cause a second signal, representative of the first signal, to be generated. The second signal is then conducted to the input terminal of the second device 20 . In an alternate mode of operation, the transceiver receives a third signal from the second device. Using series optical data links 26, 28 30, 32 , optical signals 27, 34 are generated in response to the third signal and are detected by light sensitive devices. These light sensitive devices cause a fourth signal 35 , representative of the third signal, to be generated which is then conducted to the input terminal of the first device. A control circuit 24, 36, 38 cooperates with the parallel and series optical links to enable one and inhibit the other dependent upon whether a signal is to be communicated to the second device from the first device, or to the first device from the second device.
