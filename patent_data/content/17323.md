# Contact lens disinfecting unit.

## Abstract
The invention relates to devices for use in sterilizing contact lenses. The device incorporates a casing enclosing a flat heater block 42 comprising a primary segment 42a and an extension segment 42b of less size and mass than the primary segment extending from one side of the primary segment, the primary segment being formed with a support surface 62 and with a recess 64 accommodating an electrical heating element 66 and the extension segment supporting in contact therewith a thermostat 70 in controll ing connection with the heating element. The device provides that the support surface will reach the desired sterilizing temperature and remains at that temperature long enough to sterilize lenses in a case 46 resting on the surface before the thermostat operates because owing to the differential masses of the primary segment and the extension segment the rate of heat transfer to the thermostat is less than the rate of heat transfer to the support surface.
