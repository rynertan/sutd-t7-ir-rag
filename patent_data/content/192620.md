For adapting a disc filter element of a rotatable disc filter to varying flow conditions the fluid tight filter element body 11, 12 is provided with openings 34 39 , the number of which is increased with increasing flow capacity through the filter means 17 of the filter element. Also, with increasing flow capacity the openings of the increasing number of openings are located at increasing distances from the vacuum connection 29 of the filter element. In order to prevent filtrate from entering portions of the interior of the filter element body beyond the most distant opening 39 , as seen from the vacuum connection 29 , such portions of the interior space of the filter element body are sealingly shut off from the remainder of the interior space.
