# Variable tooth saw blade.

## Abstract
A saw blade 10 is provided with an arrangement and form of teeth which reduces vibration, cutting noise and chatter, and which enhances cutting speed and blade life. In addition to having teeth 12 18 arranged in recurrent groups 11 wherein the teeth 12 18 alternately decrease and increase in gullet depth and pitch with the tips of the teeth in alignment and being set laterally to the same extend, the smaller teeth are given a positive rake angle which increases with decrease in tooth size so that the angle of attach of the smaller teeth is sharper thereby causing them to dig in and remove a larger clip, thereby tending to equalize the size of the chips removed by the different teeth.
