# ATHLETIC SHOE SOLE AND METHOD OF MANUFACTURE

## Abstract
An athletic shoe sole and a method of making the same which includes a pre formed structure 20 having a plurality of dividers 22 that define a plurality of cells 24 , the cells having therein an expanded, resilient material 40 such that the re silient material and therefore the sole has a varied hardness, the hardness being greater in zones 42 closer to the dividers than the hardness of zones 44 removed from the dividers. The pre formed size and shape of the cells may vary throughout the ex tent of the sole, resulting in a gradually varying average hard ness. At least part of the compression properties may result from the mechanical properties of the dividers 22 them selves.
