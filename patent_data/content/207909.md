# A METHOD AND AN ARRANGEMENT FOR PRODUCING A FIBRE LAYER

## Abstract
When practising a method and using an arrangement for producing a fibre layer or fibre mat from a liquid absorbent material, e.g. in the manufacture of diapers, a fibre air suspen sion is blown in between two endless, mutually parallel air permeable conveyor belts 12, 13 at a pressure which ex ceeds the pressure of the ambient surroundings. The con veyor belts form therebetween a forming space which is de fined laterally by stationary or movable side walls 18 , the inner surfaces of which may be profiled so as to provide a fibre layer or a fibre mat with profiled side edges.
