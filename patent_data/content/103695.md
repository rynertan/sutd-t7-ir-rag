# Vulcanized olefin based rubber composition.

## Abstract
A vulcanized olefin based rubber composition is dis closed which is produced by vulcanizing an olefin based rubber composition with a sulfur containing substance alone or with a sulfur containing substance and a vulcanization accelerator in combination. The olefin based rubber com position is composed of A olefin based rubber composed mainly of ethylene and propylene and B aluminium or an aluminium alloy in the form of powder, fiber, or flake, or being composed of A olefin based rubber composed mainly of ethylene and propylene, B aluminium or an aluminium alloy in the form of powder, fiber, or flake, and C electrically conductive carbon black, and said sulfur containing substance being selected from the group consist ing of a sulfur based vulcanizing agent and a sulfur releasing agent. The composition of this invention is superior in the shielding of electromagnetic waves.
