# Method of fabricating a heat exchanger and apparatus produced thereby.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method of fabricating a heat exchanger which comprises the steps of heat forming via tool 104 edge portions of holes in a plastic material sheet 101 having a plurality of holes 102 to extend through and line holes in an adjacent metal sheet 43 having holes which concentrically register with respective holes in said plastic sheet 101 , thereby to form a plastic lined metal sheet assembly inserting plug means 48 in each hole 102 before the plastic lining 101, 103, 105 has cooled to limit diametrical reduction of the plastic lined holes, spacing a pair of said plastic lined metal sheet assemblies 101, 43 securedly apart and parallel to each other and entering an end of a plastic covered tube 48 successively through a plastic lined hole in each of said plastic lined metal sheet assemblies 101, 43 sufficiently shortly after removal of the plug means 48 from said holes that the progressive diametrical reduction of said plastic lined holes allows said end to be entered through said plastic lined holes but then causes said plastic lined holes to grip and securedly locate said plastic covered tube 48 . The invention also relates to heat exchanger apparatus, comprising, in combination a pair of side members 40,41 and a pair of metal end sheets 43 defining a generally rectangular housing, each of said end sheets 43 having a plurality of holes a pair of plastic sheets 101 covering the inside surfaces of respective ones of said end sheets 43 with portions of said plastic sheets 101 extending through each of said holes 102 in said end sheets 43 to the outside of the end sheets 43 and a plurality of metal tubes 48 having plastics material protec tive exterior coverings, each of said metal tubes 48 extending through respective holes 102 in both of said end sheets 43 and being mechanically secured in place by the gripping of its exterior plastic covering by the portions 103, 104 of the plastic sheets 101 which extend through the end sheet holes through which the metal tubes 48 extend.
