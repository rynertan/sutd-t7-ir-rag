## Description
1 PHENYLCARBAMYLOXY 2 BUTYNE AS A SELECTIVE HERBICIDE IN BROADLEAF C2DPS Background of the Invention An herbicide is a compound which controls or modifies plant growth, e.g. killing, retarding, defoliating, desiccating, regulating, stunting, tillering, stimulating, and dwarfing. Plants refer to all physical parts, including seeds, seedlings, saplings, roots, tubers, stems, stalks, foliage, and fruits. Plant growth is meant to include all phases of development fran seed germination to natural or induced cessation of life. Herbicides are generally used to control or eradicate weed pests. They have gained a high degree of commercial success because it has been shown that such control can increase crop yield and reduce harvesting costs. Herbicidal effectiveness is dependent upon several variables.One of these is the time or growth related method of application. In the past, the most popular methods of application included pre plant inoorporation into the soil, pre emergence surface treatment of seeded soil, and post emergence treatment of the plant and soil. The most important determinant of herbicidal effectiveness is the susceptibility of the target weed. Certain herbicidal coocounds are phytotoxic to some weed species but not to others. The manufacturer of the herbicide recommends a range of rates and concentrations calculated to maximize weed control. The range of rates varies fran approximately 0.01 to 50 pounds per acre 0.0112 to 56 kilograms per hectare k ha , usually from 0.1 to 25 pounds per acre 0.112 to 28 X ha . The actual amount used depends upon several oonsid erations, including particular weed susceptibility and overall cost limitations. 1 phenylcarbamyloxy 2 butyne is well known as an acarlcide and for its insecticide use as described in U.S. Patent No 3,660,465, but has hereunto not been known for selective herbicidal use in broadleaf crops for controlling both grasses and broadleaf weeds. Summary of the Invention The present invention pertains to the discovery that 1 phenyl carbamoyloxy 2 butyne has the remarkable effect of controlling blackgrass, annual bluegrass, perennial ryegrass, wild oats, bedstraw, common chickweed, curly dock, ivyleaf speedwell, common lambsquarter, wild buckwheat, wild mustard and other weeds when applied at certain rates in a pre emergence or pos emergent manner, while at the same rate exhibiting no adverse effect to broadleaf crops such as sugarbeets, sunflowers and oilseed rape. The e selectivity toward broadleaf crops that is possessed by the coocound of this invention is quite unexpected and surprising in light of the fact that no previous herbicidal use has been noted in the prior art. Description of the Invention This invention is directed to the use of 1 phenylcarbamoy loxy 2 butyne as a selective herbicide for use cn broadleaf craps.Craps such as sugarbeets, sunflowers and oilseed rape show a high degree of tolerance to 1 phenylcarbamoyloxy 2 butyne. The above herbicidal compound can be prepared by the general methods described in J.S. Patent NO. 3,660,465. l Phenylcarbamoyloxy 2 butyne is a known acaricide and insecticide and its method of synthesis is well known. It is not known as a herbicide, therefore, it is quite unexpected to discover the high degree of tolerance broadleaf crops exhibit toward 1 phenylcarbamoyloxy 2 butyne. It has been discovered that 1 phenylcarbamoyloxy 2 butyne is particularly effective in control of blackgrass, annual bluegrass, peren nial ryegrass, wild oats, bedstraw, common chickweed, curly dock, ityleaf speedwell, common lambsquarter, wild buckwheat, wild mustard and other weeds. This is particularly unexpected in that no previous herbicidal use has been noted in the prior art. The compound of the present invention can be prepared according to the teaching of the following example. EXAMPLE 1 phenylcarbamoyloxy 2 butyneEMI3.1 2 Butyne 1 o1, 7.6 ml, 0.10 mole , one drop dibutyl tin dilaurate, mixed in 50 ml dry ethanol with vigorous stirring in a flask.Phenyl isocyanate 10.8 ml, 0.10 mole is added to the flask with an exothermic reaction and is heated at reflux for 1 2 hour. The reaction mixture is allowed to stand for 2 hours. Crystals formed and were filtered ofS to yield the product, m.p. 64 66 C. The yield is 15.2 grams. Analysis of the product is in agreement with the structure of the title com pound.Pre Emergence and Post emergence Screenina Tests Compound I was evaluated in greenhouse tests for pre and postemergence herbicidal activity and crop selectivity. Five separate tests were conducted using rates of application of 0.25, 0.50, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 pounds active ingredient per acre. Four grassy weed species were used in all tests, and are listed below. Seven broadleaf weed species were used among the five tests the broadleaf weed species varied frcm test to test due to the availability of germinative seed. These species are also listed below.Grasses blackgrass Alopecus myosuroides Huds. annual bluegrass Poa annua L. perennial ryegrass Lolium perenne L. wild oats Avena fatua L. 3 Broadleaf bedstraw Galium aparine L. common chickweed Stellaria media Cyrillo curly dock Rumex crispus L. ivyleaf speedwell Veronica hederaefolia L. canon lambsquarter Chencped√≠um album L. 3 wild buckwheat Polygonum convolvulus L. wild mustard Brassica per DC. Five crops were included in one Cr more of the tests and were as follows sugarbeets Beta vulgaris L. sunflower Helianthus annus L. oilseed rape Brassica napus L. J winter barley Hordeum vulgare L. 1 winter wheat Triticum aestivum L. Seed was sown into flats containing a loamy sand soil amended with fertilizer and a fungicide. Flats for pre emergence surface applications were sprayed immediately after sowing within one day. Flats for post emergence applications were put into a greenhouse and kept moist by routine hand watering. When seedlings were in a one or two true leaf stage, post emergence application was made. Compound I was weighed on a Sartorius 1265 MP scale 90 mg one pound per acre into a 60 ml bottle. The chemical was then put into solution by addition of 30 ml of acetone which was previously amended with 0.1 of polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate. The solution was then diluted with 30 ml of water. Flats were sprayed with the chemical solution by use of a linear spray table calibrated to deliver a spray volume of 80 gallons per acre. Flats were immediately moved to a greenhouse. Pre emergence flats were watered by hand from overhead. The soil in post emergence flats was kept moist by routine hand watering. Foliage was not dosed with water in order to prevent the loss of the chemical. Maximum and minimum air tem peratures in the greenhouse for an average of 20 days test period were 72 F 25 C and 60 F 15 C , respectively. Light intensity was reduced by applying a double layer of commercial glasshouse coating to the entire glasshouse. Weed control ar.d crop injury were determined at the end of eke test period by usual rating. The percent control of the weeds is based on the total injury to the plants due to all factors of injury. The rating system is from 0 to 100 percent, where the value represents percent control. For example, O represents no herbicidal effect with growth equal to untreated controls and 100 represents complete control. The results are reported in TableI.

Post emergent application is preferably made after the crop to be protected reaches a one or two leaf stage of emergence. In the preferred practice, the compound herein defined is formulated into herbicidal compositions, by admixture, in herbicidally effective amounts, with the adjuvants and carriers normally employed for facilitating the dispersion of active ingredients for agricultural applications, recognizing the fact that the formulation and mode of application of a toxicant may affect the activity of the material in a given application. Thus, the active herbicidal compound may be formulated as granules of relatively large particle size, as wettable powders, as emulsifiable concentrates, as powdery dusts, as solutions or as any of several other known types of formulations, depending upon the desired mode of application. Preferred formulations for pre emergence herbicidal applications are wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates and granules.These formulations may contain as little as about 0.5 to as rtuch as about 95 or more by weight of active ingredient. Crop injury and herbicidal effectiveness depends upon several factors, including the nature of the soil where control is desired and the types of seeds or plants to be controlled. Therefore, the rate of which dispersion readily in water or other dispersants. The wettable powder is ultimately applied to the soil either as a dry dust or as a dispersion in water or other liquid. Typical carriers for wettable pa ders include fuller s earth, kaolin clays, silicas and other readily wet organic or inorganic diluents. Wettable powders normally are prepared to contain about 5 to about 95 of the active ingredient and usually also contain a small amount of wetting, dispersing, or emulsifying agent to facilitate wetting and dispersion. Emulsifiable concentrates are homogeneous liquid composition which are dispersible in water or other dispersant, and may consist entirely of the active compound with a liquid or solid emulsifying agent, or may also contain a liquid carrier, such as xylene, heavy aromatic naphthal, isophorone and other non volatile organic solvents. For herbicidal application, these concentrates are dispersed in water or other liquid carrier and normally applied as a spray to the area to be treated.The percentage by weight of the essential active ingredient may vary according to the manner in which the composition is to be applied, but in general comprises about 0.5 to 95 of active ingredient by weight of the herbicidal composition. Granular formulations wherein the toxicant is carried on relatively coarse particles, are usually applied without dilution to the area in which suppression of vegetation is desired. Typical carriers for granular formulations include sand, fuller s earth, bentonite clays, vermiculite, perlite and other organic or inorganic materials which absorb or which may be coated with the toxicant. Granular formulations normally are prepared to contain about 5 to about 25 of active ingredients which may include surface active agents such as heavy aromatic naphthas, kerosene or other petroleum fractions, or vegetable oils and or stickers such as destrins, glue or synthetic resins. Typical wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agents used in agricultural formulations include, for exairle, the alkyl and alkylaryl sulfonates and sulfates and their sodium salts polyhydric alcohols and other types of surface active agents, many of which are available in comer merce. The surface active agent, when used, normally comprises fran 0.18 to 15 by weight of the herbicidal composition. Dusts, which are free flowing admixtures of the active ingredients with finely divided solids such as talc, clays, flours and other organic and inorganic solids which act as dispersants and carriers for the toxicant, are useful formulations for soil incorporating application. Pastes, which are homogeneous suspensions of a finely divided solid toxicant in a liquid carrier such as water or oil, are employed for specific purpose. These formulations normally contain about 5 to about 95 of active ingredient by weight, and may also contain small amounts of a wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agent to facilitate dispersion. For application, the pastes are normally diluted and applied as a spray to the area to be affected. Other useful formulations for herbicidal applications include simple solutions of the active ingredient in a dispersant in which it is completely soluble at the desired concentration, such as acetone, alkylated naphthalenes, xylene and other organic solvents. Pressurized sprays, typically aerosols, wherein the active ingredient is dispersed in finely divided form as a result of vaporizaticn of a low boiling dispersant solvent carrier, such as the Freons, may also be used. The phytotoxic coocositions of this invention are applied to the plants in the conventional manner. Thus, the dust and liquid oompo sitions can be applied to the plant by the use of pcwer dusters, boan, rope wick applications and hand sprayers and spray dusters. The copoosi tions can also be applied fran airplanes as a dust or a spray because they are effective in very low dosages. In order to modify or control growth of germinating seeds or emerging seedlings, as a typical example, the dust and liquid caositions are applied to the soil according to conventional methods and are distributed in the soil to a depth of at least 1 2 inch below the soil surface. It is not necessary that the phytotoxic oompositions be admixed with the soil particles since be these com positions can also be applied merely by spraying or sprinkling the surface of the soil. The phytotoxic compositions of this invention can also be applied by addition to irrigation water supplied to the field to be treated. This method of application permits the penetration of the com positions into the soil as the water is absorbed therein. Dust compositions, granular composition or liquid formulations applied to the surface of the soil can be distributed below the surface of the soil by conventional means such as discing, dragging Cr mixing operations. The herbicide can also be applied in the crop furrow or it can be applied by injection along side the crop and furrow in rows spaced several inches from the seed.
