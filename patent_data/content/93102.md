# A MECHANISM EFFECTING PLAY FREE SINKER MOVEMENTS IN A SHEDDING MOTION

## Abstract
The invention relates to a mechanism in a shedding motion, including a large number of preferably pneumatical ly or electromagnetically controlled selection members connectible with sinkers or the like. The novelty resides in the feature that the selection members are arranged on reciprocally mobile carrying means 1, 2 which are actuable by operating means 3, 5, 6, 9, 10 4, 7, 8, 11, 12 imparting a preferably positive movement to the carrying means and being set so that relative motion between sinkers 29 and selection members 25, 26 will be eliminated at the selection moment.
