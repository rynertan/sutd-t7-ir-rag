# PROCESS FOR PRODUCING PROPYLENE POLYMER

## Abstract
A process for producing a propylene polymer having a carbonyl group at the terminal, said process comprising po lymerizing propylene to give a living propylene polymer in the presence of a catalyst composed of beta diketone vanadium chelate and an aluminum compound represented by the for mula Râ‚‚A1X wherein R is a hydrocarbon group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms and X is a halogen atom , and reacting the living propylene polymer with a carbonylating agent.
