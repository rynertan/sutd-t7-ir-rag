# Magnetic recording medium.

## Abstract
A magnetic recording medium composed of an oriented polyethylene terephthalate film as a support layer and a thin magnetic metallic layer formed on one surface A of the support layer and optionally a lubricant layer formed on the other surface B of the support layer characterized in that 1 the surface A has a center line average CLA of not more than 0.005 µm, 2 the surface A has a peak to valley PV value of not more than 0.06 µm, 3 the number of protrusions having a height of 0.27 to 0.54 µm on the surface A is at most 0.2 per mm², and 4 the surface A is substantially free from protrusions having a height larger than 0.54 µm.
