## Abstract
The invention relates to an anti skid device for vehicle wheels, comprising a plurality of U shaped elements radially mounted on the wheel tire, and two series of connecting levers pivoted on each arm of said U elements. In order to warrant an automatical mounting operation of the device on a vehicle wheel by simply advancing the wheel on the device, each arm of each U element carries retaining means for said levers, which removably retain the U element and levers in a relative position wherein said U element forms a preset angle with the levers upstream the same, said angle corresponding to that formed when the device is mounted on the tire.
