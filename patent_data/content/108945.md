## Description
HIGH VOLTAGE SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES WITH REDUCED ON RESISTANCE Cross Reference to Related Application The present application is related to co only assigned European Patent Application 83 105 240.2 filed June 27, 1983 by M.S. Adler and E.J. Wildi one of the present inventors , the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Background of the Invention Our invention relates to semiconductor devices capable of supporting high reverse voltages while in a currentblocking state and, more particularly, to such devices having means for reducing the on resistance or anode to cathode resistance while on or conducting of the devices. The above referenced application describes a high voltage P N diode including a thin N or lightly doped N type layer atop a P substrate. An N or highly doped N type cathode region extends into the N epitaxial layer from its upper surface, and a P anode region extends into the N epitaxial layer from its upper surface and surrounds the cathode region. To reduce parasitic currents in the device, an N buried layer exists between the P substrate and the N epitaxial layer, beneath the P anode region, so as to surround the N cathode region when viewed from above .In order to avoid the loss of voltage supporting capability in the N epitaxial layer between the N cathode region and the buried layer, a further P region extends into the N epitaxial layer from its upper surface and is interposed between the N cathode region and the P anode region so as to surround the N cathode region and, in turn, be surrounded by the P anode region. The further P region is perranently biased at or near the potential the P substrate, whereby vhe N epitaxial layer, between the further P region and the N cathode region, supports reverse voltages in the device. The foregoing P N diode attains a reasonably Low value of onresistance.It would be desirable, however, to provide a diode having an even lower value of on resistance. The above referenced patent application describes and claims a bipolar transistor which is structurally similar to the foregoing P N diode. The present invention addresses a similar concern about the desirability of reduced on resistance of a bipolar transistor. Summary of the Invention Accordingly, it is an object of our invention to provide a high voltage semiconductor device having a lower value of on resistance than previously attainable. A further object of our invention is to provide electronic circuitry for enabling a high voltage semiconductor device to achieve a lower value of on resistance than previously attainable, which circuitry can be formed in a single integrated circuit along with the high voltage semiconductor device. In accordance with the illustrated embodiments of our invention, we provide a P N diode of the type including a P substrate with an N layer thereon, and further including an cathode region, a P anode region, an N buried layer, and a further P region. The N cathode region extends into the N layer from its upper surface. The anode region expends into the N layer from its pper surface and surrounds theN cathode region as viewed from above .The N buried layer is situated between the N epitaxial layer and the P substrate, beneath the P anode region, and surrounds the N cathode region. The further P region extends into the N epitaxial layer from its upper surface, surrounds the N cathode region and, in turn, is surrounded by the P anode region. We provide a bias means for supplying the further P region with a plurality of different bias drives, one at a time, so as to effect different degrees of conductivity in the N epitaxial layer, between the N cathode region and the P anode region. In accordance with a further embodiment of our invention, we provide a bipolar transistor which is structurally similar to the foregoing P N diode, except that an N emitter region extends into a P region corresponding to the P anode region of the P N diode. The bipolar transistor has an collector region corresponding to the N cathode region of the P N diode. Brief Descriotion of the Drawings While the specification concludes with claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which we regard as our invention, it is believed that the invention will be better understood with reference to the following description, taken in conjunction with the drawings, in which FIGURE 1 is a schematic view in cross section of a portion of a P N diode in accordance with our invention FIGURE 2 is a view of a modified P N diode incorporating an alternative bias means in accordance with our invention FIGURE 3 is a detail view of a portion of the P N diode of FIGURE 1 and FIGURE 4 is a view of a modification of the structure of FIGURE 3 for implementing a bipolar transistor. Descriotion of the Preferred Embodiments FIGURE 1 illustrates a portion of a P N diode LO to the left of a line of symmetry 12. P N diode LO suitably comprises a bulk P substrate 14, preferably silicon, with anN layer 16 thereon, preferably an epitaxial silicon layer.An N cathode region 18 extends into the N layer 16 from the upper surface thereof. A P anode region 20 extends into N layer 16 from its upper surface and surrounds N region 18 as viewed from above. N buried layer 22 is situated betweenN layer 16 and P substrate 14, beneath P anode region 20 and surrounds N cathode region 18. A further Pf region 24 extends into N layer 16 from its upper surface, surrounds cathode region 18, and, in turn, is surrounded by P anode region 20. A P isolation region 26 is integrally connected toP substrate 14, and surrounds the periphery of N layer 16, thereby enabling other semiconductor devices to be formed, along with P N diode 10, in an integrated circuit. The presence of N buried layer 22 in P N diode 10 serves to reduce parasitic currents in diode 10 that otherwise would exist. The presence of P region 24, appropriately biased to a potential approximately equal to or slightly more positive than that of P substrate 14 when diode LO is in a currentblocking state, enables the portion of N epitaxial layer 16 between P region 24 and N cathode 18 to support high reverse voltages. This is because, without pt region 24 so biased, N buried layer 22 would rise in potential to that of N cathode 18, leaving only the thin region of N layer 16 between N buried layer 22 and P anode region 20 to support reverse voltages. Such thin region of N layer 16 would likely break down under high reverse voltage. provide a In accordance with our invention,welbias means 28 for supplying pt region 24 with a plurality of different bias drives so as to differently bias P N junction 32, extant between P region 24 and N layer 16. The different biasing conditions of P N junction 32 serve to effect different degrees of conductivity in the N layer 16 between P anode region 20 and N cathode region 18, as will be described more fully hereinbelow. Bias means 28, in the exemplary embodiment illustrated, comprises a depletion mode i.e., normally conducting P channel metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor MOSFET 34. MOSFET 34, in the absence of any bias voltage on its gate 36, electrically shorts P region 24 to isolation region 26, which is at the potential of P substrate 14. This is because, in such state of MOSFET 34, P channel 38 of MOSFET 34 provides a high conductivity path between P region 40, which is electrically shorted to P region 24, and a isolation region 26.When gate 36 is biased with positive voltage in excess of a threshold value so as to depleteP channel 38 of holes and thereby reduce its conductivity,P region 24 is open circuited, that is, supplied with a bias drive of zero current, This zero current bias drive of P region 24 advantageously results in P N diode 10 having a lower value of on resistance than if P region 24 were biased to the potential of P substrate 14. This is because, in P N diode 10, there is a ch smaller depletion region extending into N layer L6 from P N junction 32, in contrast to the case where region 24 is biased to the P substrate 14 potential, such as appertains to the P N diode of the above referenced application. Bias means 28 with MOSFET 34 is 2preferably formed along with P N diode 10 in a single integrated circuit. However, bias means 28 could be implemented as a separate device. Bias means 28 is an exemplary bias means for P region 24, and could be implemented in many different forms. For example, MOSFET 34 of bias means 28 could be replaced by other switching means, such as a bipolar transistor. Moreover, the bias means for Pi region 24 could be implemented as bias means 28 , which is illustrated in FIGURE 2. FIGURE 2 depicts a P N diode 40, which is identical to P N diode 10 FIGURE 1 except for the inclusion of a different bias means 28 for the corresponding P region 24 , shown to the left of Pf isolation region 26 . The different bias means 28 includes a resistance means 50 of ohmic valueR having a terminal 52 adapted to be connected to a source of voltage not shown so as to be biased at a positive voltage,Vs, and a further terminal 54, which is connected to region 24 . Bias means 28 further includes an enhancement mode or normally off MOSFET 56.One terminal 58 of MOSFET 56 is electrically shorted, via electrode 60, to P isolation region 26 , which is at the potential of P substrate L. Another terminal 62 of MOSFET 56 is electrically shorted, via conductor 68, to P region 24 . Bias means 28 is effective to produce, via conductor 68, two different bias drives on P region 24 . These two different bias drives can be readily understood by considering voltage pulses 70 and 72, which can be determined by monitoring gate 74 of MOSFET 56 and conductor 68, respectively. With zero bias voltage on gate 74, the voltage on conductor 68 is equal to the bias voltage Vs on terminal 52, reduced by the IR or current x resistance voltage drop across resistance means 50. Consequently, P region 24 is supplied with a bias drive characterized by the voltage on conductor 68 and by a current limited by the combined resistances of the voltage source not shown which biases terminal 52 to V8 volts, the resistance means 50, and the resistance through P region 24 to a ground or reference level. With gate 74 of MOSFET 56 biased at a positive voltage, Vs, above a threshold value, an inversion layer is formed in region 76 of MOSFET 56, beneath gate 74. The inversion layer is highly conductive to electrons, and, together with N regions 78 and 80, completes a current path from terminal 58, which is at the potential of P substrate 14 , to conductor 68, via terminal 62, thereby biasing conductor 68 to the potential ofP substrate 14 . With conductor 68 so biased, P region 24 is supplied with a bias drive characterized by the P substrate 14 potential and by no current or zero level current , sinceP N junction 32 , between P region 24 and N layer 16 is reverse biased. When P N diode 40 is operating in its current blocking state, P region 24 should be supplied with a bias drive characterized by the potential of P substrate 14 and zero current. When P N diode 40 is operating in its c ent conducting state, however, P region 24 should be s Lied with a bias drive characterized by being at the potential Vs, as reduced b7 the IR voltage drop across resistance means 50.With such potential of P region 24 being greater than about one volt above the potential of P anode region 2 3 , at least for silicon devices, P N junction 32 , between P region 24 and N layer 16 , is forward biased, and, in accordance with an important aspect of our invention P region 24 thereby injects holes into N layer 16 . Then, in accordance with the principle of quasi neutrality as discussed for example, inR.S. Muller and T.I. Kamins, Device Electronics for IntegratedCircuits, New York,N.Y. Wiley Sons 1977 ,pages 105, Illandll2, the concentration of electrons in N layer 16 increases to approximately that of the holes injected thereinto by region 24 .As a result, the resistance of N layer 16 , between P anode region 20 and N cathode region 18 , is reduced, thereby reducing the on resistance of P N diode 40 so as to achieve a main objective of our invention. While resistance means 50 and MOSFET 56 are illustrated in the preferred embodiment in which they are formed along withP N diode 40 in a single integrated circuit, such devices could alternatively be formed as separate devices. If devices 50 and 56 are formed in a single integrated circuit as illustrated, it is desirable that P isolation region 26 be interposed betweenP N diode 40 and such devices. P isolation reeion 261 could be omitted, however, if the distance of separation between P N diode 40 and such devices is sufficient ro prevenr adverse electrical interference therebetween, although this would result in more space consumed in the integrated circuit. Our invention is also useful in semiconductor devices other than P N diodes, such as bipolar transistors. To make a bipolar transistor requires a variation of the structure associated with P anode region 20 FIGURE 1 , which is the illustrated in detail view of FIGURE 3. Appropriate modified structure is shown in FIGURE 4, in which P base region 120 corresponds to P anode region 20 of FIGURE 3. In FIGURE 4, N emitter region 190 extends into P base region 120 from the upper surface of region 120, and surrounds an N collector region not illustrated which corresponds to N cathode region 18 of P N diode 10 FIGURE 1 . In fabricating the devices illustrated herein, each of the regions shown as extending into a device from the upper surface thereof can be formed by either diffusion or ion implantation, and the N buried layers can be formed by either diffusion or ion implantation through the upper surface of the respective P substrate prior to the growth of the respectiveN epitaxial layer thereon. In the best mode we contemplate for practising our invention, the mathematical product of the thickness and doping concentration of the N epitaxial layer of each device described herein zs selected in accordance with Reduced Surface Field or RESURF Technology in order to maximize the reverse voltage attainable by each device.

Stupp, Design of High Density Power Lateral DMOSTransistors , Proceedings of the 1980 IEEE Power ElectronicsSpecialists Conference, pages 164 167.
