# Method and device for measuring blood flow in blood vessels.

## Abstract
A method and implantable device for measuring blood flow through a blood vessel within human or animal bodies uti lizes the principle of energy conversion to heat by myocardial activity, organ metabolism, and laminar frictional flow in blood vessels, and measures the heat dissipation through the vessel wall with obstruction to flow. The device, which comprises a support sheath 10 having a thermocouple 16 or thermistor embedded therein, is placed next to the vessel wall. An output signal from the sensor 16 correlates blood flow with tempera ture. With an obstruction to flow, the temperature drops. Two sensors 16 placed in series, proximal and distal to a repaired vessel are connected transcutaneously to a temperature moni tor and detection of a temperature difference is indicative of an occlusion at the repair site.
