## Description
MOUNTING EXTEI D AREA ARTICLES BY ATTACHNENT SYSTE CO OPERATING SITH EDGE REGIONS OF THE ARTICLES This invention relates to the mounting of articles having an extended area such that the articles can effectively cover extended area surfaces by an attachment system which co operetes with the edge regions only of the articles and ulso the surfaces. In particular the invention is concerned with the mounting of such articles so es to cover sheets of glass under conditions in which it is not possible to make use of scres, pins or the like or the use of adhesives. A particular application of the system of the invention is to the mounting of a visor to cover the rear scrcen of a motor vehicle. As is well known the screens of motor vehicles are usually retained in place solely by an endless elastomerie moulding which provides not only a seatin for the screen but also a weather proof joint with the bodywork of the vehicle. In view of the above it will be clear that any arrangement for mounting a visor must be such that it does not damage or blemish the body rk of the vehicle surrounding the scrcen, does not interfere with the weather sealing of the sorcen, is able to whthetand the streeses and strains introduced by the movenjonts of the vehicle nd the effects of the varion weather conditions encountelied by the vehicle. Also the mounting must be such as to enable the visor to be readily fitted and removed without the need for complicated tools and location arrangemente. A further difficulty inherent in the provision of attachment arrangements arises from the point that the rear screens of vehicles occur in a wide variety of shapes i.e., rectsn0ular, trapezoidal and in a variety of profiles i.e., flat or curved in one or more planes. It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved mounting arrangement for extended area articles such as visors which overcomes or at least reduces the effects of the above mentioned difficulties, According to the present invention there is provided a system for attaching an extended area article in face to face relationship with a surface connected to a support therefor by means of an elastomeric retaining element defining the border of the surface and connecting solely with the periphery of the surface, the system comprising at least one first type of rotaining neans having a firet part adapted to enter betwcen the clement and said surface so an to be gripped therebetween, and a second part groviding a slot like opening fer receiving and locating an edge of the article, the system forther comprising at leart one second type of retaining nano ineluding a first part operationally similar to the first part of the first type of retaining means and a second part having a locking element which is adapted to be engaged by 2 complementary locking element provided upon the article at such position that it is cc operable with the associated second type of retaining means, the arrangement being such that on engaging a first type retaining means with the border so that it is able to co operate with a region of the surface which is opposed to the surface region associated with the second type retaining means and engaging the first mentioned edge of the article in the slot of the first type retaining means and then engaging the complementary locking elements of the second type retaining mans the article is secured in position with respect to the surface. Preferably, several of said first type retaining means are provided at several positi ons around the surface. Conveniently, the second type retaining means are provided at the end regions of the lowermst edge of the article. Preferably, the systes also comprises a third type of retaining means including a base section providing a first part erperationally similar to the first part of the first type retaining n.eal s, and a support part unpstanding from the base part for receiving and supporting the end of a rod or bar, whereby on connecting two of the third type retaining means to the support by engagement with the order a bar or rod can be supported in a predetermined position relative to the support, and wherein said third type of retaining means also includes a peg or the like adapted to engage with said panel or the like in such mariner that the panel or the like is additionally anchored by the pegs or the like Reference will now be made to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is an oblique view of a visor illustrating parts of the systam of the invention, Figure 2 is a part sectional view of a retaining means of the invention, Figure 3 is an exploded view of a detail of Figure 2, Figure 4 is an oblique view of a further retaining means of the invention, Figure 5 is a view of a further retaining means, Figure 6 is an oblique view of a modified detail of the invention. Referring noz to Figure 1 this schematically shows an attachi nejit in the form Of a visor 1 stunted on the rear screen 2 of a vehicle Gio shown h visor includes a single piece moulded structure formed conveniently from a plastics material and including an upper louvre 3, 1 bottom louvre 4 and intermediate louvres 5. In practice, the number of intermediate louvres can differ from the number shown in Figure 1. The end region of the louvres 3,4 and 5 comprise transverse end walls 3A,4A, and 5A which connect with a side edge strip 6. The top edge of the louvre 3 terminates as an upper edge strip 7 which lies in the same plane as the edge strips 6. With the construction shown the louvres are profiled for both structural strength and visual appearance. For convenience of description herein they can be regarded as forming a series of spaced parallel strips which do not overlap. The relationship of the upper edge 8 of any louvre with the rear edge 9 of the next lower adjacent louvre is to produce a narrow slot 10 which extends for substantially the full width of the panel or visor. In the Figure there are three such slots respectively provided between the louvre pairs 3 5, 5 5, 5 4. A fourth slot 11 is effectively produced between the rear part of the bottom louvre 4 and the adjacent surface of the scrsen 2, The adj code louver pairs are structurally reinforced at their mid paints by luterconrectir.g profiled ribs 12 which essential.ly provide risers between adjacent ouvres. The bottom louvre 4 is provided with a profiled strengthening and air flow deflector or spoiler section 13 including a wall forming piece 14 lying generally transverse to the plane of the main body of the louvre 4. An attachment lug 15 shaped to provide a substantially rigid structure is provided at the midpoint of the wall piece 14. An aperture 16 is provided in the lug. The centre top edge 7 is stepped as at 17, whilst the body of the louvre 3 is provided with an integral raised portion 18 having a wall 19 ruining transverse to the surface of the louvre, This wall is apertured as at 20. Each end region of the bottom louvre is shaped to provide amounting lug 21 for a first part of the attachment system of the invention. The lug is shaped so as to provide two support pads 22 which lie in the general plane of the two side edge strips 6 and are intended to bear against the screen when the visor is fitted. The portion of the lug 21 lying botween the pads 22 is ateppod or otherwise raised above the plabe of the pads 22. This lug formation is Lhcv L t greater detail I in Figure 2. The central portion ,3 of the lug 21 is apertured as at 24 to receive a locking element 25 having a cylindrical ,section 2 , which is freely rotatable in the aperture 84 , Te element 25 is held in place by annular flanges 27 and 28 integral with the section 26, the flange 27 being di ensioned and shaped as to be able to enter the aperture 24 and to be pushed therethrough to the position shown but cannot subsequently be removed. The element 25 is provided with a finger grip 29 with a slot 30 for receiving a coin, screwdriver or the like aid to rotation. A short cylindrical neck31 extends in prolongation of the section 26.A cross piece 32 is provided at the end of the neck 31.The neck and cross piece combine to provide a locking element with respect to a suitably shaped keyhole 33 provided in a boss 34 upstanding from a generally rectangular element 35. As can be more readily seen from Figure 3 the cross piece 32 will enter the keyhole when aligned as indicated in Figure 3 but is not able to engage or dis engage from the keyhole when in other positions. The reculr element is formed from a plastics material and is of such thickness that the part 36 can be inserted between the moulding holding the screen in place and the surface of the screen. The edge 37 of the part 36 is provided with short lugs 38 which are intended to hook over the edge of the screen when the part 36 is inserted as described. he top edge and the side edges of the vigor are retained in place by retaining elements 39 such as is illustrated in Figure 4. The element 39 includes a first flat elongate part 40 which is intended to be inserted between the screen and the rubber moulding 2A which is for this reason is provided with short lugs 41 which are able to hook over the edge of the screen, a small part of which is shown at 42 in Figure 4. The element 39 includes a second flat elongate part 43 which is spaced from the surface of the screen by means of a step 44 so that when the part 40 is inserted between the screen 42 And the moulding a slot 45 is produced into which the relevant edge of the visor can be inserted. It will be understood that the resiliency of the moulding in conjunction with the relative dimensions of the element 39 ensures a firm grip. The elereng of Figure 4 cab be of rectangalar shape or eurved according to whether or not the element is required to co operated with a cornor aroa or a struight section of tile edgc of the pa1 c I. In addition to the above additional retating elements are provided for positionally locating a bar or rod which is attachable to the lug 21 and to the lug 15 and to provide a hinge facility for the visor, on release of the retaining arrangements so far discussed. This rod or bar is held in place by two similarly constructed retaining supports 46 of which one is illustrated in Figure 5. Each support 46 includes a rectangular base 47 of which a part 48 is intended to be inserted between the screen 2 and the rubber surround. This part of the base is provided with the shallow lugs not shown for hooking over the edge of the screen. An upstanding block or pillar 49 is provided on the base 47. The pillar has a bore 50 into which the end of the rod 51 is to be inserted as a firm push fit. An outwardly directed spigot 52 extends from the pillar. Two of the supports 46 are provided in such positions that the spigots can engage in the apertures 16 and 20. It will be understood that the rod 51 in e t endin Iong the ccntral region of the louvre aud thus the isor provides a stiffening and support for the cent l part of the visor For this reason the profiling and shaping of the risers or ribs 12, and if necessary the louvre a are grooved or otherwise channeled to accommodate the bar. The above described attachment elements are used to secure the visor to the screen surround and the attachment of the visor can be as follows, the rod 51 is engaged in the two supports 46 so that the spigots face away from each other with the parts 48 engaged in the nip of the resilient screen border and the screen. The stepped elements can then be fitted or alternatively they can be left to a later stage. The parts 36 of the elements are fitted and the locking elements 25 are engaged with the keyhole slots in the parts 35. he stepped parts can now be fitted if they have not already been fitted. Since it may be required at times to be able to cleanse the screen it is necessary partially to release the visor. This partial release involves release of the locking elements 25 and the disengagemeftof the lug 21 from the associated spigot 52. The edge strips 6 and 7 are released from the stepped elements 39. Having released the above mentioned elements the visor is conventiently pivotted upwards using the upper spigot as the pivot. Referring to Figure 6 this shows a modification of the element in which the finger grip is dispensed with and the slot 30 is formed directly in the surface of the annular flarige. In a further variation not shown the surface of the annular flange is adapted for receiving an Fallen type key. If desired the element surface could be provided with a boss with flats for receiving a spanner
