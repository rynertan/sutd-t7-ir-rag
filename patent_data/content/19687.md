# Apparatus for and method of sheet presence detection.

## Abstract
Two clamps 12 and 13 holding the edges of a paper sheet 17 on a drum 16 each contain an aperture 21 and 41 which are optically scanned to detect the presence of paper in the clamps. Additional clamps are placed along the edges of the document so that registration of the paper will be detected. A single detector 24 scans the apertures as the drum rotates the clamps past the detector. A dark light dark sequence of reflected light signals verifies that the paper is properly positioned in a clamp.
