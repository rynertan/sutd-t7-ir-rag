# Connector assembly, methods of forming connections and anchored marine structures.

## Abstract
A connector assembly comprises first 7 and second 4 connecting parts which are oriented for joining by a guide post 6 and a cable having a hydraulic hose core 2 terminat ing in a radially expandable mandrel 1 . Cable 2 is threaded through a bore in connecting part 4 and located in bore 8 of guide post 6 by a hydraulic latch. The cable 2 is tensioned and connecting part 4 slid along the cable to receive guide post 6 in opening 19 thus orienting the two connecting parts for proper connection.
