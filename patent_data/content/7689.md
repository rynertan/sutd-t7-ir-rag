# Production of sodium cephamandole derivatives.

## Abstract
A process for preparing the methanolate crystalline form of sodium cefamandole which comprises the step of mixing at a temperature between about 20 C. and about 30 C. a sus pension of sodium O formylcefamandole in methyl alcohol having a ratio of about one gram of sodium O formylcefamandole for between about 2.5 ml. and about 3.5 ml. of methyl alcohol, said suspension containing between about 1.5 percent and about 3 percent by volume of water, with a concentrated solution of sodium hydroxide in methyl alcohol in an amount corresponding to about 1 ml. of said concentrated solution per gram of sodium O formylcefamandole in said suspension. The crystalline sodium cefamandole methanolate can be separated from the suspension and converted to sodium cefamandole anhydrate for pharmaceutical use.
