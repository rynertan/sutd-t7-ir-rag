# Detection of fibrin monomer and composition therefor.

## Abstract
The invention concerns a quantitiative method and composition for precipitating fibrin monomers from plasma in the presence of fibrinogen, with only a small amount, if any, of fibrinogen being precipitated. A buffered precipitat ing agent is provided having a pH in the range of 6.5 0.5, the buffer being one having a pKa in the range of 6 to 7 and protamine sulfate at a level of 0.025 to 0.2 by weight. Suit able buffers are 2 N morpholino ethanesulfonic acid, sodium phosphate, histidine, maleic acid and imidazole. Analysis of the amount of fibrin present can be made by analyzing for protein using preferably a basic urea solution containing sodium hydroxide and measuring the absorbance of 282 nanometers.
