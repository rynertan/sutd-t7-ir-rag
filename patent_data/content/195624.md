# Fluorescent labels and labeled species and their use in analytical elements and determinations.

## Abstract
Fluorescent labels comprise a polysaccharide bound to a polymeric particle which contains a fluorescent rare earth chelate. These labels can be attached to any of a variety of physiologically reactive species to provide labeled species which have improved stability in aqueous solutions. The labeled species are particularly useful in specific binding assays to determine an immunologically reactive ligand, e.g. a hapten, in either solution or dry analytical techniques.
