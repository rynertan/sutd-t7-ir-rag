## Description
A PROCESS FOR PRODUCING HOSIERY ITEMS This invention relates to the production of hosiery items from continuous knitted cylindrical hose. Double cylinder knitting machines are well known and in wide use, which consist of an upper cylinder including upper needles and a lower cylinder including lower needles.Continuous circular knitted hose is produced having toe portions and heel portions at given intervals depending upon the type of hose required, the length of material therebetween being such as to include a certain amount of wastage permitting the continuous hose band to be cut or cropped as necessary to produce individual items of hosiery.Normally wastage is allowed adjacent in advance of each toe portion. In conventional practice individual items of hosiery are separated from the continuous band so enabling totally automatic knitting, as the knitted hose band is fed downwardly from the knitting machine, by unpicking the knitted material in the waste portion bordering on the toe portion. This is done by hand and is not only extremely time consuming and tedious but is also particularly tiring on the eye. In addition, there is a danger of spoiling the product by miscutting. In order to avoid the problems associated with conventional practice, there have been many proposals, among which is the employment of an automatic separator but this has involved suspending knitting during separation of each item. In other words, items of hosiery are knitted one by one.This is very inefficient in comparison with the continuous knitting process, and it is equally likely to produce spoiled products because of dropped stitches. Another proposal is to provide thermally fusible welts in the material preceding each toe portion of the continuous hose band , the welted parts then being dipped in hot water so as to melt the fusible threads. However, this causes clogging in the stitches of the welts, thereby preventing needles from smoothly passing therethrough. A further disadvantage is that it takes some time before the dipped welted parts dry sufficiently subsequently to effect the necessary linking. As clearly pointed out above, a major disadvantage in common with the known processes is the interruption of the operation, thereby resulting in the reduced efficiency.Another disadvantage is the danger of spoiling the quality of the products. The present invention aims to solve these problems and proposes an improved process in which unit circular knit hoses can be produced in succession from a single hose band without interruption. According to one aspect of this invention, we propose a method of producing items of hosiery or the like comprising forming a continuous generally cylindrical knitted hose band having therein at intervals along its length alternate toe and heel portions and a disintegratable welt in the knitted material in advance of each toe portion, directing a suitable medium onto each welt in turn so as to cause the welt to disintegrate thereby severing items from the continuous band. It is preferred to use welts formed from thermally fusible or water soluble threads, the disintegrating medium being hot air or water respectively. According to another aspect of this invention we propose apparatus for producing items of hosiery comprising a knitting machine forming a continuous generally cylindrical knitted hose band having at intervals along its length alternate toe and heel portions and a disintegratable welt in the knitted material in advance of esch toe portion, and wherein means are provided to direct a disintegrating medium onto each welt in turn so as to cause the welt to disintegrate thereby severing items from the continuous band. An embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawing, which shows apparatus for putting into effect the method of the invention. A continuous length of circular knitted hose band 3 is produced by a double cylinder knitting machine including an upper cylinder 1 and a lower cylinder 2, the hose band 3 having formed therein toe portions 3a and heel portions 3b. Tension is maintained in the hose band 3 by a tension device 5 including rollers 5a mounted on a frame 4 and driven by a chain 9 carried on a sprocket 10. Since the driving mechanism will be known to those skilled in the art, no detailed explanation is given.The hose band 3 is intermittently pulled down by the pair of rollers 5a and enters a duct 6 suspended from the top of the frame 4. In passing through the duct 6 the hose band 3 is cut into unit knit hoses, each hose including one toe portion and one heel portion. The toe portions 3a and heel portions 3b of the hose band are knitted in the conventional manner that is the rotation of the lower cylinder and the tension rotor 5 is stopped, thereby causing the hose band 3 to stop its rotation. At this stage the upper cylinder 1 is 0 rotated repeatedly by 180 in the clockwise and counter clockwise direction. In this way the toe portions and the heel portions are formed at given intervals, with waste portions being interposed therebetween. In the border between the toe portion and the waste portion a welt is inset with disintegratable threads.When the hose band 3 passes through the duct 6, the disintegratable welt is subjected to disintegrating medium provided by a severing device 8 in a preferred embodiment the severing device comprises a hot air nozzle, and the meltable welts are knitted with thermally fusible threads. When a water soluble thread is used in the welts, a water jet nozzle will be employed instead of the hot air nozzle. The disintegratable welts are made in the known manner by feeding meltable threads onto the hose band when the same is stopped as mentioned above. The severing device 8 is located at a suitable place beside the duct 6, and ejects hot air through an opening 7 against each welt 11 of the hose band, the operation being accurately controlled such that the ejection occurs precisely as the welted portion confronts the opening 7, by a limit switch not shown actuated by a projection lOa on the sprocket 10. Instead of the limit switch, a timer can be employed. The hot air nozzle may be replaced by any other device capable of emitting a suitable disintegrating medium. For example, devices for emitting electromagnetic waves, high frequency waves or a laser beam, can be employed. In this way items of hosiery 3c are separated from the hose band 3 one by one, and pile up at the bottom of the duct 6. These hosiery items are withdrawn under suction. The material of each item in the region of the point of severance can be safe from clogging , thereby ensuring a smooth insertion of the point of a linking machine. This yields a good quality product. In addition, it is not necessary to dry the cut section, and a linking operation can be immediately initiated.
