## Description
DESCRIPTION DATA PROCESSING SYSTEM technical Field The present invention relates to a data processing system which can readily change a control program of its own, and more particularly to a data processing system which is well suited for use in a microprocessor having a built in memory. Background Art In recent year, microprocessors have been extensively utilized for controlling various apparatuses with enhancement in the density of integration and enhancement in the operating speed. As such a controlling microprocessor, a microprocessor in the form of a single chip having a builtin memory capable of receiving a control program is convenient. In this regard, a read only memory hereinbelow, termed ROM , the stored content of which is not erased even when the supply of power is terminated, is used as the aforementioned memory for storing the control program but is disadvantageous in that it is not easy to change the control program. Mor specifically, most ROMs built in i chip microprocessors are mask ROMs, which cannot readily change programs.Although erasable ROMs are built in some 1 chip microprocessors, they, have problems in price, supply and reliability because of larger LSI chips than in the mask ROMs. The above points will be concretely described with regard to a servomotor control in a numerical control system. When applying a microprocessor to the control of a servomotor in a numerical control system, a large number of control programs are prepared for each motor or each control system which is to be controlled. Therefore, a predetermined control program suited to the motor control must be selected from among the control programs, so as to control the motor on the basis of the selected control program. To the end of selecting the predetermined control program and properly controlling the motor in this manner, it has been considered to employ an erasable ROM EROM mounted externally of the microprocessor, as the microprocessor memory, and to write the control program suited to the motor or the motor control, into the EROM.Since, however, the measure of employing the external EROM necessitates the ROM besides the processor fabricated in the form of a single chip, it increases the number of components and is not recommendable.It has also been considered to accommodate a plurality of control programs in a single ROM. However, the ROM requires a large capacity in order to receive all the control programs. This is disadvantageous from the standpoints of cost and installation space. Accordingly, the present invention has for its object to provide a novel data processing system which can readily change a control program stored within a microprocessor. Disclosure of the Invention Disclosed in the present invention is a data processing system comprising a microprocessor having an internal random access memory, a nonvolatile memory in which control programs of the microprocessor are stored, a loading unit which transmits the content of the nonvolatile memory to the microprocessor, and a data bus which connects them, whereby the control program stored in the nonvolatile memory is transmitted to the random access memory of the microprocessor by the loading unit, so as to process data in accordance with this control program.This data processing system is so constructed as to transmit the control program from the nonvolatile memory storing the control programs, to the random access memory of each microprocessor. Therefore, each microprocessor need not be equipped with ROMs for the various control programs and the change in control programs can be achieved with ease. In particular, the system is very useful for a numerical control system in which complicated control is required. Brief Description of the Drawings Figure 1 is a block diagram of an embodiment of the present invention. Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention The present invention will now be described in detail in connection with an embodiment. Figure 1 shows a block diagram of one embodiment of the present invention. In the figure, numeral 1 designates a nonvolatile memory which stores control programs and which is constructed of, for example, a bubble memory or a ROM. Numeral 2 designates a loading unit which reads out and transmits the content of the nonvolatile memory 1, and which is constructed of a microprocessor having a built in ROM or random access memory hereinbelow, termed RAM . Microprocessors 3 and 4 are respectively constructed of processors proper 3a and 4a, and RAMs 3brand 4b for storing the control programs of the processors 3a and 4a. Numerals 5 and 7 indicate output units which are controlled by the microprocessors 3, 4, and which are motors in this example.Numerals 6 and 8 indicate input units, which are, in this example, detectors that detect the states of the motors, e.g., the rotating speeds thereof and deliver them to the microprocessors 3, 4. Shown at numeral 9 is a main data bus which connects the nonvolatile memory 1, loading unit 2 and microprocessors 3, 4 to one another, and which is also connected to a main processor 10, a control panel 11, etc. for the numerical control. Move commands, commanded speeds, etc. are entered from the main processor 10 to the microprocessors 3, 4 through the data bus. Data buses 12, 13 interconnect the microprocessors 3, 4, output units 5, 7 and input units 6, 8. Next, the operations of these constituents will be explained. In the nonvolatile memory 1, various control programs for controlling the respective motors are stored with identifier codes for example, names assigned thereto.In addition, it is assumed that the respective microprocessors 3 and 4 are prepared for the respective controllable axes in the numerical control. When power from a power supply is introduced a power on signal PWON goes to logical 1 , the loading unit 2 starts upon sensing the introduction power and reads out the content of the nonvolatile memory 1 in accordance with a control program of its own stored in the built in ROM.The corresponding relationships between the respective microprocessors 3, 4 and the identification numbers, e.g., control program names of the control programs required for these microprocessors are set with the control panel 11 in advance. Accordingly, the loading unit 2 transmits the required control programs to the RAMs 3b, 4b of the respective microprocessors 3, 4 through the data bus 9 while referring to the corresponding relationships and stores them in the RAMs 3b, 4b. The loading unit 2 further sends start signals to the respective microprocessors 3, 4 through the data bus 9 after the end of the above transmission. In response to the signals, the microprocessors 3, 4 start operating in accordance with the control programs of the RAMs 3b, 4b.On the other hand, speed commands and movement value commands are given from the aforementioned main processor through the data bus 9, so that the respective microprocessors 3 and 4 control the motors output units 5 and 7 through the data buses 12 and 13. A numerical control system is originally equipped with a nonvolatile memory in order to store various parameters and machining data. Therefore, a part of this memory can be utilized without specially providing the nonvolatile memory 1 stated before. In addition, the corresponding relationships between the control programs and the microprocessors must be easily settable and changeable. However, once they have been set, they are hardly ever altered. Switches are therefore disposed inside the control panel or the like so as to establish semifixed relationships, in order that the corresponding relationships may be set by means of only the switches.This measure prevents changes in the corresponding relationships and a resulting malfunction as may be caused by accidental operation attributed to the fact that switches protrude from the outside of the apparatus. Although a numerical control system has been exemplified in the above description, the invention is not restricted thereto but is also utilizable for other control systems. Industrial Applicability As set forth above, according to the present invention, a data processing system is so constructed as to transmit a control program from a nonvolatile memory storing control programs, to the random access memory of each microprocessor. Therefore, each microprocessor need not be equiped with ROMs for the respective control programs, and a change in control programs can be achieved with ease.In particular, the system is very useful for a numerical control system in which complicated control is required.
