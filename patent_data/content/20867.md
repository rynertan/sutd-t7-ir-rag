# Ethoxylation with strontium bases.

## Abstract
Basic compounds of strontium catalyzed the ethoxylation of alcohols in the presence of phenol or alkylphenol co catalyst. Strontium produced ethoxylates have sharper ethylene oxide distributions, lower free alcohol, lower pour points, and better detergency than the ethoxylates obtained from alkali base catalysis.
