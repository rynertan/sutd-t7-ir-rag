# Method of improving wear resistance of titanium bodies.

## Abstract
Wear resistance of surfaces of titanium and titanium alloy bodies that are in contact with each other during movement of the bodies relative to each other is improved by ion plating a thin layer of titanium nitride on the surfaces of these bodies.

## Claims
1. A method of preventing wear to the surface of titanium bodies or titanium alloy bodies subject to mutual contact while at least one of said bodies is moving relative to another of said bodies, said method comprising forming, by ion plating, a thin layer of titanium nitride on said surfaces.

## Description
The invention described herein was made under contract with the United States Government and may be manufactured and used by or for the Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or thereunder. This invention relates to a method of improving the wear resistance of mutually contacting titanium and titanium alloy bodies, one moving relative to another. Bodies formed of titanium and its alloys wear very poorly when run against each other particularly when run in a dry, non lubricated condition, a condition which frequently occurs when such bodies are employed as mutually opposing components of cryocoolers. In addition, mutually contacting titanium and titanium alloy components when moving relative to each other exhibit a marked tendency to destructive galling and seizing. Mutual contacting of titanium and titanium alloy cryocooler components, one moving relative to another, occurs, for example, when the cryocooler is employed in a launched vehicle. Thus, under some conditions titanium piston rods that are ordinarily magnetically suspended in titanium cyclinders are forced into contact with the shaft. Additionally, undesired mutual contact of opposing titanium components, one moving relative to another may also occur due to power failure and vibration of the cryocooler. Titanium and titanium alloy components are also frequently employed in the chemical, aeronautical and naval industries and here too the problems of wear, galling and seizing also frequently occur when these components are in mutual contact and in motion relative to each other. A method of providing a protective coating on titanium and titanium alloys is shown in Zaplatynsky, U.S. Patent 4,434,189. This patent shows a method of creating a protective coating of titanium nitride on titanium and titanium alloy substrates by heating for example with a laser a portion of a surface of a moving substrate below its melting point, but sufficiently high to cause a reaction with nitrogen, while in a nitrogen atmosphere. By this means the heated portion of the surface is converted to a protective layer of titanium nitride. This method as the disadvantage of requiring the use of high heat, which at the patent shows in col.3, lines 1 6, may be as high as 1800 C. The use of such high temperatures is frequently undesirable as it causes damage to thin, accurately dimensioned surfaces and structures. Further the formation of a titanium nitride surface by ion plating on steel objects is shown in Sasanuma, U.S. Patent 4,480,010. However, there is no suggestion in this patent of forming the titanium nitride coating on a titanium body nor is there any suggestion that such a coating would improve the behavior of mutually contacting titanium bodies. Itaba et al, U. S. Patent 4,450,205 discloses a method of preventing separation of a titanium coating from a metal substrate in a blade member and preventing stress or cracking of the tungsten layer by forming a thin layer of titanium nitride of a thickness of 0.5 10 µm on the tungsten surface by ion plating. However, this patent teaches nothing about the use of ion plated titanium nitride coatings for improving the behavior of mutually contacting titanium and titanium alloy bodies moving relative to each other. A principal object of this invention is to provide an improved method for improving the wear resistance of mutually contacting titanium and titanium alloy bodies at least one moving relative to another. This and other objects of the invention will be apparent from the description of the invention that follows. According to the method of the invention the wear resistance of the surfaces of mutually contacting bodies titanium and titanium alloy bodies, at least one moving relative to another is improved by forming, by ion plating, a thin layer of titanium nitride or the surfaces of the bodies. Preferably, the thickness of the titanium layer is 2 4 µm as this thickness provides the optimum wear resistance. Mutually contacting surfaces of mutually moving titanium and titanium alloy bodies have been found to exhibit essentially no wear when protected by a titanium nitride layer provided by the method of the invention. Further, the coating provided by this method also prevents galling and seizing of the surfaces of such mutually contacting titanium and titanium alloy bodies. Additionally, the method of the invention has the advantage over that of the Zaplatynsky patent of not requiring the use of high heat and thus not damaging thin, accurately dimensioned surfaces and structures. For a more complete understanding the invention will now be described in greater detail. Titanium bearings adapted for use in Stirling cycle cryocoolers were degreased and cleaned using a vapor degreaser equipped with a spray wand to dislodge any of the inherent contamination and remove soil from the surfaces. The components were then placed in an ion deposition chamber provided with a titanium cathode. The pressure in the chamber was reduced to 10 The current flow was then interrupted, the nitrogen atmosphere was replaced by a vacuum and the coated bearings were cooled for 30 minutes and then nitrogen was admitted to speed up the cooling. The coated bearings were then removed. Analysis showed a uniform coating of titanium nitrid of a thickness of approximately 1.8 2.0µm to be present on the bearings. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the titanium nitride coating on a titanium surface was made. A cylindrical rod and cylinder were prepared so that an accurately dimensioned fit of rod into cylinder was established. The ground rod and honed cylinder were prepared with a fine surface finish, typically an 8 16 microinch finish. The fit between the cylinder and rod surfaces was established at 0.0007 0.0001 inches. The surfaces were cleaned and coated with a titanium nitride layer as described previously and placed in a fixture whereby the rod and cylinder surfaces could be brought into contact with known preloading on the contact surfaces. The fixture was mounted to a shaker table so that the rod cylinder sample could be vibrated with known energies and also by repositioning the fixture the shaking could be performed in each of the three aces of motion. Typically a 3 5 g preload force was imposed during a 100 500 Hz white noise vibration was imposed on the sample causing the rod to move in a reciprocal sliding motion in the cylinder. Tests were run for 5 minutes duration. The coated surfaces of rod and cylinder were examined after each run for evidence of contact, wear and particulate generation. No evidence of wear or particulate generation was found for the conditions set forth. A slight burnishing or polishing of some areas was noted in some instances.
