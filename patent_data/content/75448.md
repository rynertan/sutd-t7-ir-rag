# DOUBLE BLADED SHEAR

## Abstract
A shear for shearing metal workpieces has two blade carriers which are moved relative to each other so that blades carried by the two carriers are brought into shearing relation with the workpiece. Each blade carrier has support for two blades and is movable between two positions in which respective blades are in the operating position. With this arrangement, once one pair of blades need resharpen ing, the other pair is brought into use and then both pairs are eventually changed together.
