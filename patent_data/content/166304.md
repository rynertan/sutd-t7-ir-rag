# Image processing method.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an image processing apparatus in which an image stored in a source area in an image memory area is processed and stored in a destination area in the image memory area. The apparatus determine as to whether the des tination area overlaps on the source area to generate a first re sponse signal indicating the occurrence of the overlap or a second response signal indicating the non occurrence of the overlap. If non occurrence, the image in the source area is pro cessed as a single image block. If the destination area overlaps on the source area, the image in the source area is divided into plural sub image blocks and priority is assigned to the sub im age blocks. Then, the sub image blocks are processed in ac cordance with the priority.
