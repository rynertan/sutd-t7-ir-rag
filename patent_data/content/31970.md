## Description
Profiled Hinge JointThe invention concerns profiled hinge joints of extruded aluminum frames having a bead means closed in longitudinal direction and a cep shaped flange fitting around the bead means and having an open portion over a certain angle.These profiled hinge joints, which are used for roller shutters, greenhouse windows, letter boxes and the like, are so designed that they can slide into each other in the longitudinal direction of the joint wings,which are designed in the form of profiled frames.It is an object of the present invention to so improve the construction of a similar profiled hinge stint that also relatively large panels are easily capable of engaging each other without having to slide the profiled frame members into each other in longitudinal direction, said panels now being engageable with each other in a certain position.This offers the advantage that, for instance in case of lifting doors, the panels may be easily mounted.According to the present invention, this object is attained by utilizing a profiled hinge joint of the type as described hereinbefore,wherein the bead member, on the side remote from the frame member, has been provided with a partially restricted part and the cap shaped flange possesses a slot of such a width that the bead member is to be laterally inserted into the cap shaped flange with an angle outside the hinging field of both frame members with respect to each other. Furier the frame member provided with the bead has at least two flanges disposed at right angles to each other and the bead has been positioned near one of the flanges.This presents the advantage that when the bead member is surrounded by the shell type member formed at one corner of the corresponding frame member, both joint wings formed by the frame members are in complete alignment with respect to each other.According to a further object of the present invention the bead member, on the side facing the frame member, is partially surrounded by a shell type member, forming part of the frame member, there being located between the shell and the bead member a chamber for receiving the cap shaped flange.This presents the advantage that the cap shaped flange is entirely enclosed and is capable of performing, both outside and inside, a supporting function, Moreover, the advantage of having a good, wind proof joint is thus obtain ed. According to the invention, a practical embodiment of the profiled hinge joint consists in that the frame member provided with the bead member has at least two flanges disposed perpendicular to each other and in that the shell forms the connection between the two said flanges, the bead member being connected with one of the two flanges and the chamber surrounding the bead member like a section of a cylindrical housing, the cap shaped flange being formed in the vicinity of the line of intersection of two frame flanges disposed at an angle with respect to each other. The invention will now be illustrated by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of a lifting door provided with profiled hinge joint members in accordance with the invention Figure 2 is a cross sectional view of a profiled hinge joint as disposed between two panels of the lifting door shown in Figure 1 Figure 3 is a strongly enlarged, cross sectional view of a detail in Figure 2 Figure 4 is a plan view of a profiled hinge joint member mounted in a lifting door, having a roller in a guide rail Figures 5 8 are sectional views, as shown in Fi gure 3, wherein the joint wings are in different positions with respect to one another, and Figure 9 is a section, identical to the one in Figure 2, wherein a roller has been mounted in the hinge joint member.In case of lifting doors, which do not have enough space above the door opening, guide rails are used which are curved above the door, in the door then being composed of panels 1 being hingedly attached to each other. At the location of the hinge joints there are mounted on the side edges of the doors, rollers 2 which are adapted to fit into the guide rails 3a and 3b.As is clearly visible in Figure 1, the guide rails 3a and 3b change into a curved portion mounted to the ceiling or other holding means. On lifting the door, the panels 1, while moving, assume different positions with respect to one another until they have arrived in the curved portion when the door has been opened completely. To this end the panels 1 are provided with profiled hinge joints in the form of a profiled lower frame 4 and a profiled upper frame 5.The manner in which the door is elevated, for example by means of a drive mechanism, will not be described as this does not form part of the subject matter of the present invention.The lower frame 4 is provided with a hollow bead member 6, being connected with a side flange 7 of the frame 4.The bead member 6 is disposed stepped relative to the flange 7 and has a slanted area 17. A portion of the outer wall of the bead member 6 has a restricted area for a purpose to be described hereinafter. This restricted portion is referenced 18 in Figure 3. The radius of said recess 18 runs from a centre differing from that of the radius of the remaining portion of the bead member 6. In addition, the bead member 6 is in longitudinal direction provided with a bore 19 for receiving a pin 20 of a roller 2 Fig. 4 .The bead member 6 is surrounded by a shell 8 forming the connection between the flange 7 and the flange 9 of the frame 4. sA chamber being open at the location of the flange 9, vide in particular Figure 3, is thus formed around the bead member 6.A cap shaped flange 11 of the profiled frame member 5 is adapted to fit around the bead member 6 and in the chamber 10. Said cap shaped flange 11 is located between two flanges 12 and 13 of the frame member 5 which are disposed at an angle with respect to each ether. The cap shaped flange 11 has a relatively large, open portion so as to enable the frame member 5 to engage the frame member 4 while still ensuring an adequate supporting function of the cap shaped frame 11, since the latter fits with its inner wall 14 around the bead member 6 and rests with its outer wall 15 against a wall 16 of said chamber 10.When positioning a panel 1 between the rails, its cap shaped flange 11 is disposed upon the bead member 6 and slid inwards, the pin 20 being pushed tighly with its roller against the frame 5, so that the panel can be pressed between the rails 3a and 3b. Thereupon, the roller with the pin is slid outwards to beyond a flange 21 of the rails 3. The pin 20 is subsequently secured in the opening 19 of the bead member 6 by means of a tension pin or a locking screw.Figure 5 shows the profiled hinge joint in the situation occurring at the moment when a panel 1 is brought into position above another panel. Firstly the hinge joint is snapped in, whereby the area connecting the cap shaped flange 11 to the flange 13 will fit in the recess 18 with the slanted section 17, as shown in Figure 6. The cap shaped flange 11 thus penetrates into the chamber 10 of the profiled frame 4, also because of the chamber 10 having a widened section in the vicinity of the flange 9. Figure 7, shows that on continuing the swinging movement, the inner wall of the cap 11 comes into a closer position around the bead member, thus detaching the recess 18 from the wall of said cap shaped flange 11. Thus, the frame members 4 and 5 are positioned with respect to one another, so that they can move in an articulated manner in relation to each other, for example from a square position as shown in Figure 8, to a closed position as shown in Figure 9. The frame member 4 has a shoulder 22 for abutment of the frame member 5. As a result, draught strips 23 can be arranged between the flanges 12 and 9 so that a door comprising panels 1 provides a good, wind proof seal in a closed position. The roller 2 is then resting against the flange 21 of a guide rail 3a or 3b.
