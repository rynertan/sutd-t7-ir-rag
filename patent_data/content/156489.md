# Ceramic glass material, capacitor made therefrom and method of making the same.

## Abstract
A ceramic glass material comprising a mixture of fine particles of barium titanate, leaded glass frit and an additive material containing manganese. A ceramic glass body and capacitor made from the material by firing the ceramic glass material to a peak temperature between 900 C and 1050 C in a non oxidizing atmosphere at which the glass softens. The capacitor has non precious metal electrodes with a melting point above the firing temperature which are co fired with the ceramic glass material. Upon cooling the fired ceramic glass material and electrodes form a capacitor with the ce ramic glass body separating the electrodes and providing a high dielectric constant and insulation resistance, and a low dissipation factor.
