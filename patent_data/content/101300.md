# HYDROPHILIC COPOLYMER COMPOSITIONS USEFUL AS CONTACT LENSES

## Abstract
Novel hydrophilic copolymers are prepared containing a major portion of polymerized units of an hydroxyalkyl acrylate or methacrylate monomer and a minor portion of a nirtro substituted aryl acrylate or methacrylate monomer, and optionally with a minor amount of an alkylene glycol diacrylate or methacrylate as a cross linking agent. These copolymers are made by a free radical polymerization mechanism or by gamma radiation of the reaction mixture. These copolymers are particularly useful as sort contact lens polymers, being extremely resistant to clouding and or discoloration in use.
