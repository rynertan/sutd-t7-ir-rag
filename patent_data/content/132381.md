# Method of synchronizing the sequence by which a variety of randomly called unrelated activities are executed in a digital processor.

## Abstract
A method of synchronizing the sequence by which a vari ety of unrelated activities are executed in a digital processor when the activities are randomly called by multiple callers in cludes the steps of providing a single processor queue for holding respective pointers to each different kind of activity that the processor performs entering the pointer of an activity in the processor queue the first time that the activity is called providing respective activity queues for each different kind of activity that the processor performs entering a pointer to the caller of an activity in the respective queue for the called activ ity each time the activity is called subsequent to its first call repeatedly executing a single activity pointed to by one pointer in the processor queue until that activity is executed once for each of its callers, provided that if the single activity calls an other activity then, executing the single activity only up to the point where the call occurs and proceeding in the same fashion with the execution of another activity pointed to by the proces sor queue.
