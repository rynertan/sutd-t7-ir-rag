# Vacuum switch provided with horseshoe shaped element for generating an axial magnetic field.

## Abstract
Electrical vacuum switch provided with two mutually mov able contacts of conductive material, mounted on the ends of a fixed or movable contact rod, with a laminated horseshoe shaped ferromagnetic element being fitted around each contact rod. The magnetic circuit around the contact rod consists of a section of low magnetic resistance and a section of a high magnetic resistance. The circular base of the U shaped inner cavity of the horseshoe shaped element is adjacent to the associated contact rod and the elements are offset through 180 C with respect to each other, so that the internal magnetic fields generated in the horseshoe shaped elements when current passes through the switch, to the extent that the section with high magnetic resis tance is approached, are mainly oriented axially between the two horseshoe shaped elements. Said elements are so designed that their magnetic resistance to the internal magnetic field increases in going from the U shaped base section to the section with high magnetic resistance.
