# Chlorosulfonyl isocyanate derivatives as anaerobic accelerators.

## Abstract
Products formed from chlorosulfonyl isocyanate either by sequential reaction of a hydroxy functional compound followed by reaction of the sulfonyl chloride group with a primary or secondary amine, or by reaction of chlorosulfonyl isocyanate with an excess of primary or secondary amine, are cure accelerators for anaerobic acrylic compositions. Depending on the choice of alcohol or amine, the accelerator may be functionalized so that it is bound or bindable to an organic or silicone polymer backbone or contains other desirable functionality such as peroxy, photosensitizer, or acrylic groups.
