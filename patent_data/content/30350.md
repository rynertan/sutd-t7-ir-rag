# Method for reducing the terminal carboxyl group content of a saturated polyester, a saturated polyester having a reduced terminal carboxyl group content, and a molded article composed of such a saturated polyester.

## Abstract
Saturated polyesters having a reduced terminal car boxyl group content are produced by reacting a carboxyl terminated, substantially linear, fiber forming saturated polyester with a monocyclic imino ether compound of the formula
