# Improved moulding tool and method.

## Abstract
A coating and method of depositing it is provided. The wear resistant coating comprises a thin layer of disordered boron and carbon applied to a substrate. The coating has good adherence and provides good resistance to wear so that it is useful as a tool coating. In a more specific embodiment, the coating is disordered boron carbide. The coating can be made by sputtering boron and carbon onto a substrate. A bias voltage may be applied to the substrate during sputtering. The disordered boron and carbon coating can have a com position B An improved molding tool 10 is provided that includes a disordered carbon coating on at least a portion of the working surface of the molding tool 10 . The coating provides im proved release characteristics, longer tool life and results in molded articles having smoother finishes and improved detail.
