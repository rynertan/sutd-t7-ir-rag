# Apparatus for vulcanizing a tire.

## Abstract
This disclosure relates to apparatus for vulcanizing a tire, and includes a pair of generally annular split dies 1, 2 which are axially movable relative to each other, and pair of generally circular supports 3, 4 surrounded by the dies. The supports include bead seats 5b which are engageable with the axially outer sides of the tire beads so as to form a closed space between the supports and within the tire. The space is supplied with a pressure medium which is heated during vulcanization. The supports are axially movable relative to each other and to the dies. Each of the supports 3, 4 has mounted thereon a plurality of pivotal members 6 which are movable into engagement with the axially inner sides of the tire beads. The pivotal members 6 press the beads tightly against the bead seats 5b in order to form a seal between the beads and the bead seats.
