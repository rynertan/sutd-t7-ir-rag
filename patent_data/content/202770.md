## Description
This invention relates to a light sensitive silver halide color photographic material, more particularly, to a light sensitive silver halide color photographic material having high sensitivity and excellent color reproducibility. In the color photography employing a light sensitive silver halide color photographic material, the color reproduction is carried out, in general, by the subtractive color process. Namely, in an ordinary light sensitive silver halide color photographic material, a yellow dye forming coupler is used in a blue light sensitive emulsion layer, a magenta dye forming coupler in a green light sensitive emulsion layer, and a cyan dye forming coupler in a red light sensitive emulsion layer. In the color developing after imagewise exposure, an oxidation product of a color developing agent to be formed by development of light sensitive silver halides undergoes a coupling reaction with the above dye forming couplers to form yellow, magenta and cyan dye images, respectively, whereby the color reproduction is achieved. The color reproducibility is one of the most important performances which may decide the quality of a color photograph. Accordingly, since the discovery of the principle of the above color photography, there has been made a number of studies for improvement in the color reproducibility. Although there are many factors which affect the color reproducibility, important factors among those are the spectral sensitivity characteristics of a light sensitive silver halide emulsion and the spectral absorption characteristics of a color dye. In the spectral sensitivity characteristic of a light sensitive silver halide emulsion, what is particularly questioned is a question of the blue sensitivity of a silver halide having been subjected to spectral sensitization. In nature, the silver halide has a sensitivity only to blue light in a visible light, but it is possible by the technique of spectral sensitization which is known in the art to make the silver halide have the sensitivities to green light and red light and further to infrared light also. Therefore, by the spectral sensitization, silver halide grains are made to have the sensitivities to blue light and light in a spectral sensitized region for example, green light, red light, etc. . Because of the blue light sensitivity of the silver halide having been subjected to the spectral sensitization, however, it follows that, in the above mentioned light sensitive silver halide color photographic material, magenta and cyan color development may also incidentally take place besides yellow color development, during the course of color developingt after imagewise exposure by blue light, to bring about an undesirability in the color reproduction. As one of techniques to solve this problem, there is a method in which a yellow filter is provided below the blue light sensitive emulsion layer, i.e., on the side distant from a light source. This method is greatly effective, but has disadvantages such that it reults in high production cost, has no effect on the layers upper than the yellow fileter namely, when, for example, a blue light sensitive emulsion layer or a red light sensitive emulsion layer is provided on the side nearer to the light source than the blue light sensitive emulsion layer . In any event, from a viewpoint of the color reproduction, it is preferable to make the sensitivity to the spectral sensitized region as high as possible as compared with the blue light sensitivity. Next, as to the spectral absorption characteristics, what are preferable for the color reproduction may be mentioned to be that the wavelength giving maximum spectral absorption in the visible region hereinafter referred to as primary absorption and the shape of a peak of the primary absorption are adequate, and that there is less excessive absorption other than the primary absorption hereinafter referred to as secondary absorption . Firstly, in respect of the primary absorption, it is generally known to be improved to a considerable extent by selecting substituents for a coupler or high boiling organic solvents for a coupler, and there can be said that, in the present state of the art, suitable ones have been selected. However, in respect of the secondary absorption, in particular, the secondary absorption in blue regions of magenta and cyan dyes, which gives seriously bad influence to the color reproducibility, it has been attempted in general in the art to improve it by a masking method using a colored coupler, a method utilizing the interimage effect, etc. However, it does not necessarily follow that these methods can be always used. For instance, the masking method using a colored coupler can be utilized for intermediate images such as those in color negative films, but can not be utilized for what are to become final images such as those in color reversal films, color photographic papers, etc. Accordingly, it has been desired to produce a coupler capable of giving a color dye having less secondary absorption. In particular, a magenta dye forming coupler of pyrazolone series hereinafter referred to as magenta coupler , generally used in the present art, has particularly a large secondary absorption in a colored dye a pyrazolone azomethine dye , and thus its improvement has been strongly desired. The magenta coupler having less secondary absorption is known to include pyrazolinobenzimidazole series compounds disclosed in German Patents No. 10 70 030 and No. 11 27 220, pyrazolotriazole series compounds disclosed in French Patent No. 2,075,583, U.S. Patents No. 3,705,896 and No. 3,725,067, British Patent No. 1,252,418, etc., and indazolone series compounds disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 2,673,801, etc. However, in the above mentioned compounds, there are many compounds having disadvantages such that the color property is insufficient or that colored dyes are unstable to light or heat, and they have scarcely put into practical use. Among them, the compounds of pyrazolotriazole series are known to have relatively good performance, have less secondary absorption, show sharpness in the shape of the primary absorption, and are desirable couplers from the view point of the color reproduction. However, the above pyrazolotriazole series couplers, when they are designed to be put into practical use, were found to have disadvantages such that they are insufficient in the sensitivity and are liable to cause photographic fogs. Therefore, it has become understood that, in order to improve the color reproducibility by using the pyrazolotriazole series magenta couplers, essential techniques are to make high the sensitivity of a silver halide emulsion and to decrease fogs. A method most well known as the technique to make high the sensitivity is to enlarge the size of light sensitive silver halide grains. However, according to this method, it follows that not only the sensitivity in the spectral sensitized region of silver halide grains but also the sensitivity to blue light are raised generally in such a manner that the rise in sensitivity to blue light is larger , and thus such a method is not preferable from the viewpoint of the color reproduction as mentioned above. In order to raise the sensitivity in the spectral sensitized region, it is considered necessary to increase the amount of sensitizing dyes or to select other sensitizing dyes. However, such measures may often give a bad influence to other photographic performances or cause the change in spectral sensitivity, and also, in the present state in the art, considerably desirable sensitizing dyes have been used under desirable conditions. Accordingly, it is difficult to make sensitization in a large region by such measures. As a countermeasure to the increase in fogs, it is known to use an antifoggant. The antifoggant is known to include, for example, azaindenes, triazoles, tetrazoles, imidazolium salts, etc. However, if these antifoggants are used in a large amount, the lowering of sensitivity will be caused, or even if used in a large amount, it often occurs that the antifogging effect is not sufficient, and thus no fundamental solution will be achieved. In the techniques mentioned in the foregoing, there has been obtained no light sensitive silver halide color photographic material having high sensitivity and excellent color reproducibility. Accordingly, a first object of this invention is to provide a light sensitive silver halide color photographic material having excellent color reproducibility. A second object of this invention is to provide a light sensitive silver halide color photographic material having high sensitivity, being low in fogs, and having improved color reproducibility. The above objects of this invention can be achieved by a light sensitive silver halide color photographic material, having at least one light sensitive silver halide emulsion layer on a support, wherein at least one of said emulsion layer contains light sensitive silver halide grains having outer surfaces principally comprised of 100 face, and a magenta dye image forming coupler represented by Formula I shown below This invention will be described below in detail.

The couplers of this invention may be used usually in the range of 1 x 10 ³ mole to 1 mole, preferaby 1 x 10 ² to 8 x 10 ¹ mole, per mole of silver halide. The couplers of this invention may also be used in combination with other kinds of magenta couplers. Next, as the light sensitive silver halide grains having outer surfaces principally comprised of 100 face hereinafter referred to as silver halide grains according to this invention unless particularly mentioned , they may include those having the crystal habit of a cube comprising 100 face only or those having the crystal habit of tetradecahedron comprising 100 face and 111 face. Preferably, they include tetradecahedral silver halide grains satisfying the relationship of 0.5 K 50,000 when represented by K Intensity of diffraction rays assigned to 200 face Intensity of diffraction rays assigned to 222 face , which is measured by the X ray diffraction method disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 29243 1984. Further, the effect of the invention becomes particularly remarkable when they are tetradecahedral silver halide grains satisfying the relationship of 5 K 500. The silver halide grains according to this invention may be either polydispersed or monodispersed. Preferably, they include monodispersed silver halide grains having, in the grain size distribution of silver halide grains, the variation coefficient of 0.22 or less, more preferably, those having the same of 0.15 or less. Here, the variation coefficient refers to a coefficient showing the width of the grain distribution, and is defined by the following equation In the above, ri and ni represent the grain size of each grain and the number thereof, respectively. The grain size mentioned herein refers, in the case of spherical silver halide grains, to the diameter, and, in the case of cubic or other than spherical silver halide grains, it refers to diameter determined by converting a projected image thereof to a circular image having an equal area. The silver halide grains according to this invention have an average grain size preferably ranging between 0.2 and 0.8 µm. When the average grain size is less than 0.2 µm, the grains tend to be affected by change in the conditions for developing processing, and when it is more than 0.8 µm, the sensitivity to blue light becomes lower, both of which are undesirable from the view point of the color reproduction. More preferably, the silver halide grains according to this invention have an average grain size of 0.3 to 0.7 µm. There is no particular limitation to the compositional arrangement for silver halides in the the silver halide grains according to this invention, but it is preferred that it has low content for silver iodide to give substantially a silver chlorobromide emulsion. Here, what is meant by substantially a silver chlorobromide emulsion is that the silver halide in the silver halide grains contained in the silver halide emulsion comprises less than 1 mole of silver iodide and the balance being silver chloride and silver bromide. If the content of silver iodide is higher, the sensitivity to blue light of the silver halide grains becomes higher to make them undesirable from the viewpoint of the color reproduction. On the other hand, the higher the content of silver chloride is, the lower the sensitivity to blue light becomes, to make the grains desirable from the viewpoint of the color reproduction. The content of the silver chloride in the silver halide grains according to this invention is preferably 5 mole or more, more preferably, 15 mole or more. The compositional arrangement for silver halide grains according to this invention may be uniform from an inner portion to an outer portion of a grain, or may be different between the inner portion and the outer portion. Also, when the compositional arrangement is different between the inner portion and the outer portion of a grain, it may be continuously varied or non continuous. The silver halide grains according to this invention may be those obtained by any of an acidic method, a neutral method and an ammonium method. The grains may be allowed to grow at a time, or may be allowed to grow after formation of seed grains. The method of preparing seed grains and the method for growth may be the same or different. Also, method of reacting a soluble silver salt with a soluble halogen salt may include any of a regular mixing method, a reverse mixing method, a simultaneous mixing method and a combination of these methods, but preferred is a simultaneous mixing method to obtain the silver halide grains. For preparing monodispersed silver halide grains, it is also possible to employ the pAg controlled double jet method disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 48521 1979 as an embodiment of the simultaneous mixing method. Becides, if necessary, there may be used a silver halide solvent such as thioether or a crystal habit controlling agent such as a mercapto group containing compound and a sensitizing dye. To the silver halide grains according to this invention, metal ions may be added by using a cadmium salt, a zinc salt, a lead salt, a thallium salt, an iridium salt or a complex salt thereof, a rhodium salt or a complex salt thereof, an iron salt or a complex salt thereof, etc. during the course of the formation and or growth of grains to have them included in the inside and or the surface of a grain, and also, reduction sensitizing nuclei may be imparted to the inside and or the surface of a grain by placing grains in an appropreate reducible atmosphere. The silver halide emulsion according to this invention may be those from which unnecessary soluble salts have been removed after completion of the growth of silver halide grains, or those containing them as they are. When the salts are to be removed, the method disclosed in Research Disclosure No. 17643 may be used. In the silver halide emulsion layer containing the magenta coupler according to this invention, the silver halide grains according to this invention may be used alone or by mixing of plural kinds thereof. Also, they may be used in combination with other silver halide grains than the silver halide grains of the invention, which, for example, are grains not having 100 face for example, octahedral grains . In such a case, however, the proportion of the grains not having 100 face is preferably not more than 50 of the projected area held by the whole silver halide grains. The silver halide grains according to this invention may be chemically sensitized by a conventional method. Namely, the sulfur sensitization using a compound containing sulfur capable of reacting with silver ion, or an active gelatin, the selenium sensitization using a selenium compound, the reduction sensitization using a reducible substance, the noble metal sensitization using noble metal compound such as gold, etc. may be employed singularly or in combination. The silver halide grains according to this invention may be optically sensitized to a desired wavelength region by using a dye known in the photographic field as a sensitizing dye. The sensitizing dye may be used singularly or may be used in combination of two or more kinds. Together with such sensitizing dye s , a supersensitizer which is a dye having no photosensitizing action by itself or a compound not substantially absorbing any visible light, and which strengthens the sensitizing action in a sensitizing dye. The silver halide grains according to this invention is preferably subjected to spectral sensitization so as to have the sensitivity to green light. To the silver halide grains according to this invention, a compound known in the photographic field as an antifoggant or a stabilizer may be added during the course of chemical ripening and or at the time of completion of chemical ripening and or after completion of chemical ripening, but before coating of a silver halide emulsion, for the purpose of preventing fogs and or keeping stable photographic performances during the course of the preparation of photographic materials, during storage thereof or during the course of photographic processing. As for a binder or a protective colloid in an emulsion layer containing the silver halide grains according to this invention, it is advantageous to use gelatin. Becides it, there may also be used hydrophilic colloids such as a gelatin derivative, a graft polymer of gelatin with other polymers, a protein, a sugar derivative, a cellulose derivative, a synthetic hydrophilic polymer of homopolymer or copolymer, etc. In the light sensitive silver halide color photographic material of this invention referred to hereinafter as light sensitive material of this invention , the photographic emulsion layer and other hydrophilic colloid layer may be hardened by using singularly or in combination a hardening agent or agents which bridge binder or protective colloid molecules to enhance the membrane strength. The hardening agent is preferably added in an amount that can harden a light sensitive material to such a degree that may not necessitate adding another hardening agent in a processing solution, but it is also possible to add the hardening agent in the processing solution. A plasticizer may be added for the purpose of enhancing the flexibility of the silver halide emulsion layer and or other hydrophilic colloid layer in the light sensitive material of the invention. In the photographic emulsion layer and other hydrophilic colloid layer of the light sensitive material using the silver halide emulsion of this invention, a dispersion of water soluble or insoluble synthetic polymer a latex may be contained for the purpose of improving, for example, the dimentional stability. In the emulsion layer of the light sensitive material of this invention, when carrying out color developing, a dye forming coupler is used, which may form a dye by a coupling reaction with an oxidation product of an aromatic primary amine developing agent for example, a p phenylenediamine derivative, an aminophenol derivative, etc. . Usually, the dye forming coupler is selected so that there may be formed dyes which absorb light sensitive spectral light of emulsion layer with respect to the respective emulsion layers, and thus a yellow dye forming coupler, a magenta dye forming coupler and a cyan dye forming coupler are used in a blue light sensitive emulsion layer, a green light sensitive emulsion layer and a red light sensitive emulsion layer, respectively. However, depending on an object, they may be also used in a different manner from the above combination to prepare the light sensitive material of this invention. The yellow dye forming coupler includes an acylacetoamido coupler for example, benzoylacetoanilides, pivaloyaceto anilides, etc. the magenta dye forming coupler includes, besides the couplers of this invention, a 5 pyrazolone coupler, a pyrazolobenzimidazole coupler, a pyrazolotriazole coupler, an open chained acylaceto nitrile coupler, etc. and the cyan dye forming coupler includes a naphthol coupler, a phenol coupler, etc. These couplers preferably have a group having 8 or more carbon atoms, called as a ballast group, which is capable of making the coupler non dispersible. Also, these dye forming couplers may be either of four equivalents wherein four silver ions must be reduced to form a dye of one molecule, or of two equivalents wherein only two silver ions may be reduced. With respect to a hydrophobic compound such as a dye forming coupler which is not required to be adsorbed on the crystal surface of a silver halide, there may be employed various methods such as a solid dispersion method, a latex dispersion method and an oil in water type emulsion dispersion method, which may be optionally selected depending on the chemical structure of the hydrophobic compounds such as a coupler. According to the oil in water type emulsion dispersion method, a method of dispersing a hydrophobic additive such as a coupler may be applied, which method may usually comprise dissolving in a high boiling organic solvent boiling at about 150 C or higher a low boiling organic solvent and or a water soluble organic solvent which may be optionally used in combination, and carrying out emulsification dispersion by using a surface active agent in a hydrophilic binder such as a gelatin solution and by using a dispersion means such as a stirrer, a homogenizer, a colloid mill, a flow jet mixer, an ultrasonic device, etc., followed by adding a resultant dispersion to the aimed hydrophilic colloid layer. After dispersion or at the time of the dispersion, a step to remove the low boiling organic solvent may be included. As the high boiling organic solvent, an organic solvent boiling at 150 C or higher may be used, comprising a phenol derivative, a phthalate, a phosphate, a citrate, a benzoate, an alkylamide, an aliphatic acid ester, a trimesic acid ester, etc. which do not react with the oxidation product of a developing agent. As a dispersing aid to be used when the hydrophobic compound is dissolved in the solvent employing a low boiling solvent alone or in combination with the high boiling solvent to carry out the dispersion by use of a mechanical means or a ultrasonic wave, there may be used an anionic surface active agent, a nonionic surface active agent and cationic surface active agent. It may occur that an oxidation product of developing agent or an electron transferring agent is transferred between the emulsion layers between layers having same color sensitivity and or between layers having different color sensitivity of the light sensitive color photographic material of this invention, to cause color turbidity or make conspicuous the deterioration in sharpness and the graininess. In order to prevent these, a color fog preventive agent is be used. The color fog preventive agent may be used in the emulsion layer itself, or an intermediate layer may be provided between contiguous layers to use it in the intermediate layer.

In the hydrophilic colloid layers such as a protective layer or an intermediate layer of the light sensitive material of this invention, an ultraviolet absorbent may be contained in order to prevent fogs which may be produced by electrostatic discharge caused by friction or the like of the light sensitive material, or prevent deterioration of images due to ultraviolet light. In the light sensitive material of this invention, it is possible to provide an auxiliary layer such as a filter layer, antihalation layer and or an antiiradiation layer. In these layers and or emulsion layers, a dye may also be contained, which is either flow out of a light sensitive color material or bleached, during the course of developing processing.

A lubricant may be added to decrease sliding friction of the light sensitive material of this invention. For the purpose of preventing the light sensitive material from electrostatically charged, an antistatic agent may be added thereto. The antistatic agent may sometimes be used in an antistatic layer which is on the side of a support which is not provided with emulsion layers, or may be used also in a protective colloid layer other than the emulsion layers which are on the side provided with emulsion layers. In the photographic emulsion layers and or the other hydrophilic colloid layers of the light sensitive material of this invention, various surface active agents may be used for the purpose of improvement in coating property, prevention of electrostatic discharge, improvement in lubricity, emulsification dispersion, prevention of sticking and improvement in other photographic properties such as development acceleration, achievement of high contrast, and sensitization . The photographic emulsion layers and the other layers of the light sensitive material of this invention may be coated on a flexible reflective support such as a baryta paper, a paper laminated with α olefin polymer or the like, a synthetic paper a film comprised of a semi synthetic or synthetic polymer such as cellulose acetate, cellulose nitrate, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene terephthalate, polycarbonate and polyamide or a hard material such as glass, metal and ceramic. The light sensitive material of this invention may be coated on the surface of a support directly or through interposition of one or two or more of subbing layer s for improving adhesion property of the support surface, antistatic property, dimentional stability, wear resistance, hardness, antihalation property, friction characteristics and or the other characteristics , optionally after application of corona discharge, ultraviolet irradiation, flame treatment, etc. When the light sensitive material of this invention is coated, a thickening agent may be used to improve the coating property. As the coating method, extrusion coating and curtain coating are particularly useful, which are feasible of coating two or more layers simultaneously. The light sensitive material of this invention may be exposed by use of electromagnetic waves in the spectral region to which the emulsion layers constituting the light sensitive material of this invention has sensitivity. As a light source, there may be used any of known light sources such as natural light sunlight , a tungsten lamp, a fluorescent lamp, a mercury lamp, a xenon arc lamp, a carbon arc lamp, a xenon flash lamp, a cathode ray tube flying spot, every kind of laser beams, light from light emitting diode, light emitted from a fluorescent substance energized by electron rays, X rays, gamma rays, alpha rays, etc. As for the exposure time, it is possible to make exposure, not to speak of exposure of 1 millisecond to 1 second usually used in cameras, of not more than 1 microsecond, for example, 100 microseconds to 1 microsecond by use of a cathode ray tube or a xenon arc lamp, and it is also possible to make exposure longer than 1 second. Such exposure may be carried out continuously or may be carried out intermittently. The light sensitive material of this invention can form images by carrying out color development known in the art. The aromatic primary amine series color developing agent used for a color developing solution in this invention includes known ones widely used in the various color photographic processes. These developing agents include aminophenol series and p phenylenediamine series derivatives. These compounds, which are more stable than in a free state, are used generally in the form of a salt, for example, in the form of a hydrochloride or a sulfate. Also, these compounds are used generally in concentration of about 0.1 g to about 30 g per liter of the color developing agent, preferably in concentration of about 1 g to about 15 g per liter of the color developing agent. The aminophenol series developing agent may include, for example, o aminophenol, p aminophenol, 5 amino 2 oxytoluen, 2 amino 3 oxytoluen, 2 oxy 3 amino 1,4 dimethylbenzene, etc. Most useful aromatic primary amine series color developing agents include N,N dialkyl p phenylenediamine series compounds, wherein an alkyl group and a phenyl group may be substituted with an optional substituent. Of these, particularly preferable compounds may include, for example, N,N diethyl p phenylenediamine hydrochloride, N methyl p phenylenediamine hydrochloride, N,N dimethyl p phenylenediamine hydrochloride, 2 amino 5 N ethyl N dodecylamino toluen, N ethyl N β methanesulfonamideethyl 3 methyl 4 aminoaniline sulfate, N ethyl N β hydroxyethylaminoaniline, 4 amino 3 methyl N,N diethylaniline, 4 amino N 2 methoxyethyl N ethyl 3 methylaniline p toluene sulfonate, etc. Also, in addition to the above aromatic primary amine series color developing agents, the color developing solution used in the processing in this invention may optionally further contain various components usually added in the color developing solution, for example, an alkali agent such as sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, a sulfite of alkali metals, a bisulfite of alkali metals, a thiocyanate of alkali metals, a halogen compound of alkali metals, benzyl alcohol, a water softening agent, a thickening agent, etc. This color developing solution has generally the pH value of 7 or more, most generally about 10 to about 13. In this invention, after color developing processing, processing by use of a processing solution having fixing ability is carried out. When the processing solution having fixing ability is a fixing solution, a bleaching is carried out beforehand. As a bleaching agent used in the bleaching step, there may be used a metal complex salt of an organic acid. The metal complex salt has an action to oxidize a metal silver formed by development to allow it to revert to silver halide, and, at the same time, color develop an undeveloped portion of a coupler. It has the structure in which a metal ion such as cobalt ion, cupper ion, etc. is coordinated with an organic acid such as an aminopolycarboxylic acid or oxalic acid, citric acid, etc. The organic acid most preferably used for formation of the metal complex salt of such an organic acid may include polycarboxylic acid or aminopolycarboxylic acid. The polycarboxylic acid or aminopolycarboxylic acid may be in the form of an alkali metal salt, an ammonium salt or a water soluble amine salt. Typical examples of these may include the following A bleaching solution to be used may contain as the bleaching agent the above metal complex salt of the organic acid, and also contain various additives. Preferably, the additives to be contained may include in particular a re halgenating agent such as an alkali halide or an ammonium halide, for example, potassium bromide, sodium bromide, sodium chloride, ammonium bromide, etc., a metal salt and a chelating agent. Also, there may be optionally added those which are known to be usually added to a bleaching solution, including a pH buffering agent such as borate, oxalate, acetate, carbonate and phosphate, an alkylamine, a polyethyleneoxide, etc. Further, the fixing solution and bleach fixing solution may contain a pH buffering agent including sulfites such as ammonium sulfite, potassium sulfite, ammonium bisulfite, potassium bisulfite, sodium bisulfite, ammonium metabisulfite, potassium metabisulfite and sodium metabisulfite, and boric acid, borax, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium bicarbonate, acetic acid, sodium acetate, ammonium hydroxide, etc., which may be added singularly or in combination of two or more. When the processing of this invention is carried out while replenishing a bleach fixing replenishing agent in a bleach fixing solution or bath , the bleach fixing solution or bath may contain a thiosulfate, a thiocyanate or a sulfite, etc., or these salts may be contained in a bleach fixing replenishing solution which is replenished to the processing bath. In this invention, if desired, blowing of air or blowing of oxygen may be carried out in the bleach fixing bath and in a storage tank for the bleach fixing replenishing solution in order to enhance the activity in the bleach fixing solution, or a suitable oxidizing agent including, for example, hydrogen peroxide, bromate, persulfate, etc. may be added. This invention will be described concretely by referring to the following Examples, by which, however, embodiments of this invention are not limited. An aqueous solution of silver nitrate and a mixed halide aqueous solution comprising potassium bromide and sodium chloride were mixed in the presence of inert gelatin at 50 C over a period of 10 minutes according to a double jet method, and thereafter physical ripening was carried out at 50 C for 60 minutes. Subsequently, the emulsion obtained was subjected to chemical ripening at 50 C by use of sodium thiosulfate, a sensitizing dye D 1 and 4 hydroxy 6 methyl 1,3,3a,7 tetrazaindene to obtain an emulsion EM 1. As a result of electron microscopic observation and anaylsis by X ray diffraction, EM 1 was found to be an emulsion comprising grains of silver chlorobromide silver bromide 90 mole , having an average grain size of 0.55 µm, a variation coefficient of 0.20, irregular shape, and the value K as defined in the present specification of 0.01. Next, in the presence of inert gelatin, at 60 C, and in accordance with the double jet method which is carried out while keeping the pAg constant at 7.5, and controlling the rate of addition to a maximum addition rate which was experimentally determined in advance at which new grains are no longer produced, an aqueous solution of silver nitrate and a mixed halide aqueous solution comprising potassium bromide and sodium chloride were mixed over a period of 80 minutes to obtain an emulsion EM 2. EM 2 was found to be an emulsion comprising tetradecahedral monodispersed grains of silver chlorobromide silver bromide 60 mole having an average grain size of 0.50 µm, a variation coefficient of 0.13 and a K value of 80. Next, EM 2 was divided into two fractions, one of which was subjected to chemical ripening at 55 C by using sodium thiosulfate, a sensitizing dye D 1 and 4 hydroxy 6 methyl 1,3,3a,7 tetrazaindene to obtain an emulsion EM 3. The other fraction of the divided EM 2 was similarly subjected to chemical ripening, provided that the pAg during the course of the chemical ripening and the amounts of addition of sodium thiosulfate and 4 hydroxy 6 methyl 1,3,3a,7 tetrazaindene were varied from those for EM 3 in order to make the sensitivity higher, to obtain an emulsion EM 4 which had higher sensitivity than EM 3. Next, on a paper support whose surface was coated with polyethylene containing anatase type titanium dioxide, an emulsion layer comprising the above EM 1 and a comparative coupler M 1 as magenta coupler was provided by coating to have the coating silver weight of 0.4 g m², and further on that layer a protective layer comprising gelatin and a hardening agent H 1 was provided by coating to prepare Sample 1. Next, Sample 2 was prepared in the same manner as Sample 1, except that the magenta coupler was replaced by a comparative coupler M 2. Next, Sample 3 to Sample 6 were prepared in the same manner as Sample 1, except that the magenta coupler was replaced by a comparative coupler M 3 and the exemplary compounds 18, 44 and 87 of this invention, respectively, and the coating silver weight was made to be 0.2 g m². Next, Sample 7 and Sample 8 were prepared in the same manner as Sample 2, except that the above EM 3 and EM 4 were used as emulsions, respectively. Next, Sample 9 , Sample 10 and Sample 11 were prepared in the same manner as Sample 8, except that the exemplary compounds 18, 44 and 87 were used as the magenta coupler and the coating silver weight was made to be 0.20 g m². On Sample 1 to Sample 11 obtained in the above, sensitometry characteristic tests and evaluation of the influence which the secondary absorption of magenta coupler may give to the color reproducibility were carried out according to the methods shown below, in order to confirm the effect of this invention. Results are shown in Table 1. Eleven kinds of monochromatic photographic elements were exposed to white light through an optical wedge by use of a sensitometer KS 7 type manufactured by Konishiroku Photo Industry, Co., Ltd. , and thereafter processing was carried out in accordance with the following processing steps. Density measurement was carried out on each of the samples obtained, by use of a photoelectric densitometer PDA 60 type manufactured by Konishiroku Photo Industry, Co., Ltd. . Evaluations were made on sensitivity, γ gamma and fog. Sensitivity is shown in terms of the relative value of a reciprocal of the exposure which may give the density of fog density plus 0.6 γ is shown in terms of the inclination at the density of 0.5 to 1.5 and fog is shown in terms of the value of the reflection density obtained by subtracting the base density. In respect of Sample 1 to Sample 11, by use of the same sensitometer as used in 1 , exposure to white light whose exposure was controlled in such an amount that the spectral reflection density at the maximum absorption wavelength referred to λ max in the visible region of the magenta dye may be about 1.0 was carried out, to which the developing processing in the same manner as in 1 was applied. The optical reflection density was measured on each of the samples obtained, by use of a color analyzer 607 type manufactured by Hitachi, Ltd , and evaluated in terms of the value for D430 D max shown below In this case, the smaller the value for D430 Dλmax is, the more desirable it is evaluated to be from the view point of the color reproducibility. It is seen from Table 1 that, in the samples using comparative couplers, deterioration in the color reproducibility based on the secondary absorption of magenta dye is remarkable, although there is no problem in the sensitometry characteristics except for Sample 3 and Sample 8. It is seen that Sample 3 and Sample 8 is insufficient in both the sensitometry characteristics and the color reproducibility. Also, in the comparative samples in which the magenta couplers of this invention were used, Sample 4, Sample 5 and Sample 6 which comprise combination with silver halide grains other than those of this invention have problems in the sensitivity and the fog, although the color reproducibility is good. On the other hand, it is seen that Sample 9, Sample 10 and Sample 11 which are in accordance with the constitution of this invention are satisfactory in both the color reproducibility and the sensitometry characteristics. It is also seen that, according to this invention, still higher sensitivity can be achieved than that in the comparative examples according to conventional arts, without being accompanied with deterioration of the gradation characteristics. EM 4, though having high sensitivity, has been regarded as an emulsion which could not be put into practical use because of its problem in the gradation when used in combination with the conventional pyrazolone series magenta couplers. However, it has become possible to use it in combination with the magenta couplers of this invention. This had not been expected from the data for Sample 2, Sample 7, Sample 8, etc., and was realized to be an unexpected effect this invention has brought about. Using EM 1, prepared in Example 1, as a green sensitive emulsion, and using M 1 as a magenta coupler, the respective layers as shown in Table 2 were provided by coating on a paper made support whose surface was coated with polyethylene containing anatase type titanium dioxide to prepare a multi layer light sensitive silver halide color photographic material, which was designated as Sample 12. In this sample, the third layer was made to have the coating silver weight of 0.38 g m². Next, using the magenta coupler of Exemplary Compound No. 59, Sample 13 was prepared in the same manner as Sample 12, except that the third layer was made to have the coating silver weight of 0.19 g m². Next, EM 5 was prepared in the same manner as EM 1 in Examples 1, except that the temperature for mixing a silver ion solution and a halide ion solution during the course of formation of silver halide grains and the temperature for physical ripening was altered to 60 C. Here, EM 5 had an average grain size of 0.71 µm, a variation coefficient of 0.19, irregular shape and a K value of 0.01. Next, in the same manner as EM 2 except that the proportion of potassium bromide and sodium chloride in the halide aqueous solution was varied and the pAg during the growth of silver halide grains was controlled to 8.3, a monodispersed emulsion having a crystal habit of substantially octahedron of silver chlorobromide silver bromide 80 mole , having an average grain size of 0.52 µm, a variation coefficient of 15 and a K value of 10 ⁴. This emulsion was subjected to chemical ripening in the same manner as EM 3 to obtain an emulsion EM 6. Next, in the same manner as EM 6 except that the pAg during the growth of silver halide grains was controlled to 5.0, a green sensitive emulsion EM 7 was obtained, which is comprised of cubic monidispersed grains having an average grain size of 0.51µm, a variation coefficient of 0.09 and a K value of 10⁴. Next, in the same manner as EM 6 except that the pAg during the growth of silver halide was controlled to 7.5, a green sensitive emulsion EM 8 was obtained, which is comprised of tetradecahedral monodispersed grains having an average grain size of 0.50 µm, a variation coefficient of 0.12 and a K value of 70 was obtained. Next, Sample 14 to Sample 17 were prepared in the same manner as Sample 17, except that EM 5, EM 6, EM 7 and EM 8 were respectively used as green sensitive emulsions. The light sensitive silver halide color photographic materials, Sample 12 to Sample 17, prepared as above were treated in the same manner as in Example 1, and, on the color images obtained, evaluations for the sensitometry characteristics and the color reproducibility were made according to the following method Evaluation of sensitometry characteristics was made in the same manner as in Example 1, except that an ultraviolet cut filter and a sensitivity correction filter were used when exposure was carried out. In Table 3, however, there are shown only the sensitivity and the fog value based on values obtained by measuring the density by use of green light. On the six kinds of multi layered materials, Sample 12 to Sample 17, exposure treatment and density measurement were carried out in the same procedures as shown in Example 1, except that the exposure to blue light was effected through Kodak Wratten filter No. 47B and an ultraviolet cut filter. The influence to blue sensitivity was evaluated in terms of magenta dye density density of reflection of green light D. Herein, the smaller the value for D is, it follows that the less the magenta dye color develops is, and can be said to be desirable. On the six kinds of multi layered materials, Sample 12 to Sample 17, D430 Dλmax was determined in the same manner as in item 2 in Example 1, except that the exposure to green light was effected through Kodak Wratten filter No. 61 and an ultraviolet cut filter. Herein also, the smaller the value for D430 Dλmax is, it follows that the less the secondary absorption of magenta coupler is, and can be said to be desirable from the viewpoint of the color reproducibility. As will be seen from Table 3, Sample 13 shows low sensitivity because of use of the magenta coupler of this invention, but Sample 14 in which the low sensitivity was corrected by increasing the size of silver halide grains shows increase in the blue light sensitivity, and is undesirable from the viewpoint of the color reproducibility. Also, in the case Sample 15 where silver halide grains having little 100 face, even though having the same monodispersed grains, the blue light sensitivity is undesirably higher in proportion to lowness in the green light sensitivity. Accordingly, it is seen that it is possible only in this invention to obtain the light sensitive silver halide color photographic materials having high sensitivity, low fog and excellent color reproducibility namely, the blue light sensitivity of green sensitive emulsion is low and the secondary absorption of magenta dye is small .
