# Improvements in tamper resistant container assembly.

## Abstract
A tamper resistant screw cap and container body as sembly has a cap 1 which is connected to a safety band 5 which can turn with the cap 1 when the cap is being screwed on to the container body 12 but which is held against turning when the cap is being screwed off, by the engagement of discontinuous ratchet shaped inner beads 9 on the cap 1 with discontinuous ratchet shaped outer beads 16 on the container body 12 beneath a continuous outer retaining bead 16A .
