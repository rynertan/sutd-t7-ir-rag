# CONNECTING DEVICE FOR CLOSELY SPACED CONDUCTORS AND ELECTRICAL CONTACT TERMINAL THEREFOR

## Abstract
A preloaded electrical connecting device 10 for use with closely spaced elongated conductors 64 which lie essentially in the same plane is disclosed. The device 10 is comprised of an insulated housing 12 having a plurality of contact terminal receiving cavities 22 therein and having one or more electrical contact terminals 26 therein. The terminal 26 is a flat one piece stamped sheet metal member having elongated connector means 27 at one end. The connecting means has first and second jaw members 32, 34 and a throat portion 36 . The jaw members 32, 34 have spaced apart free ends 38, 40 . In the assembled device, a portion of the free end 38 of the first jaw member 32 extends outwardly from the housing 12 . Upon placing the conductor 64 between the first and second jaw members 32, 34 and applying a deforming force to the free end 38 of the first jaw member 32 , the portion 38 is moved into the housing 12 until the end 38 is flush with the housing 12 . As the jaw portion is moved into the housing, the jaw member 32 is moved into clamping engagement with the conductor 64 and the second jaw member 34 .
