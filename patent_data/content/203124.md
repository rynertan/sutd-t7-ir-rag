## Description
The present invention relates to an airway device for selective intubation of the bronchi and separate lung ventilation, particularly during anesthesia, intensive therapy and reanimation. Known are devices for effecting a patient s respiration undergoing thoracic surgical interventions which generally consist of double tubes such as Carlens or White s tubes which permit separate ventilation of the two lungs. The separate ventilation of the two bronchi has several different objects, the most important of which are the following These double tubes generally comprise two conduits of different lengths laid side by side, which are inserted contemporaneously into the trachea of a patient. The longest conduit terminates in one of the principal bronchi and its external walls include a hook for engagement with junction zone of the two principal bronchi to stop the tube in the correct position. Although, in clinical practice, widespread use is made of Carlens or White s double tubes, their use is not devoid of inconveniences. Introduction, in fact, is not always facilitated due to the greater diameter with respect to the diameter of the standard tracheal tube and due to the different form and curvature of the distal extremity which may obstruct the passage across the larynx and progression in the trachea. Further, the correct positioning of the tube can only be controlled by auscultation and as such, it is possible that an incomplete separation of the two half systems may pass unobserved. In addition, when positioning the patient after insertion of the tube in a lateral position for thoracotomy, it is possible that the tube may become displaced. Furthermore, the presence of the hook and the curvature of the longest tube, can occasionally cause damage to the patient during its insertion. FR A 1 505 607 shows a device as defined in the pre characterising clause of claim 1. The main aim of the present invention is that of obviating the above cited inconveniences by realizing an airway which can be easily inserted into the patient at any time during a surgical intervention and which can achieve, with safety, separate, selective ventilation of the two lungs without causing damage to the patient. Within the above aim an object of the invention is that of rendering the fluid dynamic resistances at the interiors of the tracheal tube and the endobronchial tube as uniform as possible with respect to each other. This aim and this and other objects which will become apparent hereinater are achieved by a device as defined in claim 1. Other characteristics and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following description of a preferred, though not exclusive embodiment of an airway according to the invention, illustrated in the accompanying illustrative, not limitative drawings wherein With reference to the drawing figures, the airway according to the invention, indicated generally by the reference numeral 1, comprises a tracheal tube 2 insertable into the trachea 3 of a patient and at least one endobronchial tube, 6a,6b, respectively , which can be inserted into and has a greater length than the tracheal tube for reaching, with its extremity, one of the principal bronchi 4,5. The endobronchial tube, when inserted into the tracheal tube, through a port or opening at the external end thereof, defines between its external surface and the internal surface of the tracheal tube an air passage 7 such that, upon connecting the external extremity 8 of the tracheal tube, and the external extremity 9a,9b of the endobronchial tube to a device for supplying air, of a well known type and not shown in the drawing figures for reasons of clarity, one has a flow of air passing through the endobronchial tube and through the air passage 7. The endobronchial tube and the tracheal tube, expediently have a circular internal cross section and their relative sizing is arranged such as to ensure uniform, equal ventilation of the two lungs, that is, the fluid dynamic resistances, of the endobronchial tube and of the passage 7 are substantially, relatively equal this fact guarantees, in parity with the delivery flow from the air supply, an equal flow of air in the two tubes. The airway according to the invention advantageously comprises two endobronchial tubes of slightly different conformation, more precisely a first endobronchial tube 6a and a second endobronchial tube 6b which are selectively insertable into the tracheal tube according to whether one wishes to ventilate the left principal bronchus 5 or the right principal bronchus 4. Furthermore, the airway may comprise guide means for rendering associable, in mutually slideable relationship the endobronchial tube and the tracheal tube, 6a,6b, respectively. These guide means expediently comprise an expansion 10a, respectively 10b, extending longitudinally along the external surface of the endobronchial tube for at least an intermediate portion of its length and is engageable, during the insertion of the endobroncheal tube into the tracheal tube, in a guide groove 11, correspondingly defined on the internal surface of the tracheal tube. In practice the expansion 10a, respectively 10b, may have a circular or oval section with a stem 12 which in association with the external wall of the endobronchial tube prevents incorrect threading of the expansion in the guide groove 11. In this way the endobronchial tube is internally associable with the tracheal tube during the insertion and resultantly eliminates the possibility of rotation or accidental flexure of the endobronchial tube. By virtue of the fact that the possibility of rotation of the endobronchial tube with respect to the tracheal tube is eliminated, one may provide in fact, a first endobronchial tube 6a which has an internal extremity 13a inclined with respect to the longitudinal extension of the expansion 10a, such that during the insertion of the first endobronchial tube into the tracheal tube, with the expansion 10a engaged in the guide groove 11, the extremity 13a is safely orientated towards the left principal bronchus. In the same way one may provide a second endobronchial tube 6b which has an internal extremity 13b inclined with respect to the longitudinal extension of the expansion 10b, but in an opposite direction with respect to the inclination of the extremity 13a, such that during insertion of the second endobronchial tube into the tracheal tube, with the expansion 10b engaged in the guide groove 11, the extremity 13b is safely orientated towards the right principal bronchus. Obviously, according to the necessity to intubate and ventilate the right principal bronchus or the left principal bronchus one inserts into the tracheal tube, the first endobronchial tube 6a or the second endobronchial tube 6b. The first endobronchial tube 6a may comprise, proximately to the point whereat the inclination of the internal extremity 13a commences, with respect to the rest of the endobronchial tube, a hook 14, advantageously made of elastically flexible material and adapted to rest on the tracheal carena, to stop progression of the tube when it has reached the correct position in the left principal bronchus. Since the right principal bronchus has a different conformation with respect to the left principal bronchus in that it has a first bifurcation very close to the tracheal carena, the extremity of the second endobronchial tube 6b may advantageously have a bifurcated conformation, such that during insertion, the two branches 15a, 15b of the extremity 13b can be inserted into the two branches of the bifurcation of the right principal bronchus. The two branches 15a and 15b of the bifurcation may either be both hollow, or one of these branches may define a full section, in that the branch of the extremity 13b engaged with the bifurcation of the right principal bronchus will anyway guarantee ventilation of both branches of the bronchus. Obviously, the extremity 13b of the second endobronchial tube 6b must be made of a very flexible synthetic material to obtain, on bringing together the two branches 15a and 15b, easy insertion of the extremity 13b into the tracheal tube. In practice, the bifurcation of the second endobronchial tube and the hook 14 of the first endobronchial tube constitute means for stopping progression of the endobronchial tube when it has reached its correct position at the interior of the bronchus to be intubated. The airway according to the invention also comprises internal sealing means comprising a first vesicle 16, formed circumferentially around the tracheal tube 2 proximately to its internal extremity 17 and a second vesicle 18a, respectively 18b, formed circumferentially around the endobronchial tube 6a, respectively 6b, proximately to its internal extremity. In particular , it appears from figure 3 that the vesicle 18b is arranged behind the branch 15a, and from figure 2 that the vesicle 18a is located forewardly of the branch 14. The vesicles 16,18a and 18b are inflatable from the exterior through feed conduits 19,20a and 20b which are at least partially located within the tubes to communicate internally with the vesicles. The admission of air into the vesicles causes their inflation and thus, their sealing engagement with the internal walls of the organs wherein the tubes are inserted, and in this way causing isolation of that part of the organ located between the inflated vesicles. The external extremities of the feed conduits may be provided with caps 21, 22a, and 22b, for maintaining inflation of the vesicles and the feed conduits may include small bags 23,24a,24b, being elastically deformable for controlling the pressure exerted by the vesicles on the internal walls of the organs. Obviously, the vesicle 18a of the first endobronchial tube 6a will be located downstream of the hook 14, for secure engagement with the internal wall of the left principal bronchus, whilst the vesicle 18b of the second bronchial tube 6b is located upstream of the bifurcated extremity to eliminate the possibility of obstructing with the vesicle 18b, the bifurcation of the right principle bronchus. The airway according to the invention also comprises sealing means located towards the exterior comprising a stopper 25a, respectively 25b, sealingly engageable with the external extremity 8 of the tracheal tube and sealingly slideable on the endobronchial tube. thus isolating the air passage 7 from the exterior. For completeness of description, it should be added that the external extremity of the tracheal tube and the endobronchial tube are expediently provided with first ports 26,27a,27b for the connection to the air supply and second ports 28,29a,29b, closeable by means of plugs 30,31a,31b, for permitting the insertion of medical instruments such as probes and for the eventual removal of matter secreted by the organs wherein the tubes are inserted. The operation of the airway according to the invention is the following. Initially one proceeds by inserting the tracheal tube 2 into a patient s trachea 3, successively one inserts the endobronchial tube into the tracheal tube. In the case where two endobronchial tubes are provided having guide means, according to which bronchus it is desired to intubate, one inserts into the tracheal tube, either the endobronchial tube 6a or the endobronchial tube 6b. During the insertion into the tracheal tube, one bends the internal extremity 13a,13b of the endobronchial tube, utilizing the flexibility of the material of which it is made, to bring together the branches of the bifurcation or hook towards the longitudinal axis of the tube to pass easily through the tracheal tube. Whilst inserting the chosen endobronchial tube into the tracheal tube, one threads the expansion 10a, 10b into the guide groove 11. In this way the endobronchial tube is slideably associated with the tracheal tube and, when the internal extremity 13a,13b exits the extremity 17 of the tracheal tube, the internal extremity 13a,13b opens to its original position, inclined with respect to the longitudinal extension of the expansion 10a, 10b with secure positioning at the correct location in the selected principal bronchus. In the case where one desires to intubate the right principal bronchus, when the extremity 13b of the endobronchial tube 6b exits the internal extremity of the tracheal tube, as well as the return to the original inclination of the extremity 13b with respect to the expansion 10b, the two branches 15a,15b which were brought together during insertion, spread apart and engage in the bifurcation of the right principal bronchus, each being inserted into one of the branches of the bifurcation. In the same way, when one wishes to intubate the left principal bronchus, when the internal extremity of the endobronchial tube 6a reaches the correct position, the hook 14 engages with the tracheal carena. If, in either case the operator or surgeon senses resistance opposing the ulterior insertion, he may adjourn the operation. Successively, the operator may engage the stopper 25a or 25b in the external extremity of the tracheal tube by sliding it along the endobronchial tube to thus isolate the passage 7, and then proceed to inflate the vesicles 16,18a,18b to form a seal with the internal walls of the organs and, after this, one may proceed to ventilate one or both of the principal bronchi. In practice, the airway according to the invention fully achieves its objects by virtue of the passage of one tube inserted into the other, the intubation is facilitated, rendered quicker and can be effected at any time during the intervention, irrespective of the patient s position. Another advantage resides in the provision of two endobronchial tubes, each associable, through the described guide means, with the tracheal tube, and not least the internal extremity, inclined according to the bronchus to be intubated, which reduces turbulence during ventilation of the tracheal tube and safe positioning of the endobronchial tube in the selected bronchus. A further advantage, imparted by virtue of the fact that the extremity of the endobronchial tube for insertion into the right principal bronchus is bifurcated, and the presence of the hook on the endobronchial tube for insertion into the left principal bronchus, is that of obtaining in a simple manner, the correct positioning of the internal extremity of the endobronchial tube in the entubed bronchus. A not least advantage is that of having a passage, between the tracheal tube and the endobronchial tube wherein one may easily insert medical instruments or probes. Furthermore, regardless of problems or difficulties which may arise during intubation, it is always possible to obtain ventilation of at least one of the two half systems by feeding air into the endobronchial tube or the tracheal tube. In practicing the invention any dimensions or materials may be used, providing that they are compatibile with the specific use, according to the contingent requirements and the state of the art.
