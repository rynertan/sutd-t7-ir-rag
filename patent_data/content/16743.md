# Method and apparatus for controlling the effect of the centrifugal force on the stock in pulp defibrating apparatus.

## Abstract
Method and apparatus for refining pulp stock in which the pulp material is ground in a grinding space 34, 42 defined between a pair of rotatable grinding discs 18, 20 having ridges and grooves providing opposing grinding surfaces 26, 28, 30, 32 , which discs 18, 20 rotate relative to one another in an environment of a fluid medium under superatmospheric pressure and correspondingly elevated temperature in a housing 10 . The grinding space includes a first grinding zone 34 extending from a central portion of the discs and a second grinding zone 42 extending angularly from the first grinding zone 34 . The first grinding zone 34 is defined between the relatively rotatable discs 18, 20 , while the second grinding zone 42 is defined between one of the rotatable discs 18 and a stationary grinding surface 44 on at least a portion of the surface of a stationary element 46 mounted within said housing 10 and spaced apart from the other 20 of said rotatable discs to provide a gap for preventing contact between the periphery of said disc 20 and said stationary element 46 .
