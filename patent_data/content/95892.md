# Wound covering materials.

## Abstract
A wound covering material produced by applying an aque ous solution containing a polyvinyl alcohol with a degree of hydrolysis not less than 95 mol. and a viscosity average degree of polymerization not less than 1,500, a water soluble C₂ ₂₀ polyhydric alcohol having 2 8 hydroxyl groups in the molecule and a high viscosity water soluble macromolecular substance being different from polyvinyl alcohol with a viscosity of the 2 aqueous solution of 25 C not less than 300 cP, concent rations of said polyvinyl alcohol, said water soluble polyhydric alcohol and said water soluble macromolecular substance being adjusted respectively to 1.5 8 by weight, 10 85 by weight and 0.2 15 by weight, onto a flat or curved plate having 30,000 200,000 projections per m², the total area occupied by the projections being 10 70 to a thickness from 0.5 to 5 mm, cooling the applied plate to a temperature not higher than 6 C to solidify the solution and then subjecting the resulting mass to vacuum dehydration to a ratio of dehydration from 5 by weight to 95 by weight.
