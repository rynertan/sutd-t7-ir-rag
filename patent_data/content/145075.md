# Stamp and device for providing drops of a viscous liquid on a substrate.

## Abstract
In providing drops of glue on printed circuit boards or components in assembling electrical components without wires chip assembly , it is desired to provide the required quantity of glue on a small area with great positional accuracy. The invention relates to a form of stamp in which a height diameter ratio of the drop of glue can be achieved which is larger than one fifth. In usual cylindrical stamps, said ratio is approximately one tenth. The stamps according to the invention moreover reduce the effect of machine stoppage on the shape and the dimension of the drops of glue.
