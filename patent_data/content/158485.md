# DROPLET GENERATING APPARATUS

## Abstract
Uniform droplets of a liquid are produced by positioning the end of a capillary tube in the throat of a venturi. Gas flowing through the venturi detaches droplets from the end of the capillary tube without producing high volume gas flow or high velocity of the droplets. Fuel oil droplets can be formed. The method can be used to form spheroidal catalysts.
