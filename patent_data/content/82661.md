# Cruise speed control for aircraft performance management system.

## Abstract
A cruise speed control system in an aircraft performance management system wherein target Mach command is supplied to the engine automatic throttle controls 1,2,3 to establish an engine thrust to overcome and equate to the aircraft nominal drag characteristics at that commanded Mach speed and simulataneously the difference between the actual Mach number speed and the target Mach command speed is supplied to the automatic pilot pitch axis control 25 to cause the aircraft to maintain the commanded Mach speed through change in pitch attitude and altitude. The integral 47 of any altitude standoff is used to adjust required thrust to achieve the commanded Mach target and reduce the standoff to zero. If necessary, filtered altitude error 74 may be used to provide dynamic damping of the throttle control loop and compensation for long term degradation in the aircraft s drag characteristic with time is provided by measuring the drag degradation ratio 50 and adjusting the target Mach command 26, 30 in accordance therewith.
