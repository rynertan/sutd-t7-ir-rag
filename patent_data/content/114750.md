The condensation reaction is preferably carried out in an organic reaction medium, for example, methylene chloride, dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, alcohol, benzene, dioxan or tetrahydrofuran.The compounds of formula I may also suitably be prepared by reacting a compound of formula VIII EMI22.1 wherein R1, R10 and Y are as hereinbefore defined and the amino group is optionally substituted with a group which permits acylation to take place, and any reactive groups may be protected with an N acylating derivative of an acid of formula IX EMI22.2 wherein R2 and R3 are as hereinbefore defined and wherein any reactive groups may be protected and thereafter, if necessary, carrying out one or more of the following steps i removing any carboxyl protecting group R10 ii removing any protecting groups on R1, R2, R3 or Y iii converting the product into a salt or in vivo hydrolysable ester thereof. The compounds of formula VIII herein which are inter alia intermediates for the compounds of formula I as hereinbefore defined may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula VI with an N acylating derivative of an acid of formula XI EMI23.1 wherein P11 is an amino protecting group and thereafter removing protecting group Rll. Suitable amino protecting groups R11 are those well known in the art which may be removed under conventional conditions without disruption of the remainder of the molecule.Examples of amino protecting groups for R11 include benzyl optionally substituted in the phenyl ring by one or two substituents selected from C14 alkyl, C1 4 alkoxy, trifluoromethyl, halogen or nitro C14 alkoxycarbonyl, for example tert butoxycarbonyl benzyloxycarbonyl optionally substituted as for benzyl above allyloxycarbonyl trityl or trichloroethoxycarbonyl.Preferred examples of N protecting groups within 211 include those listed above which are removable under acid conditions optionally in the presence of a group IIb metal.The intermediate compound of formula VI as hereinbefore defined may suitably be prepared by formylating a compound of formula XII EMI24.1 wherein R9, R11 and Y are as hereinbefore defined and thereafter removing the protecting group R11 and if necessary, converting a group R9 to a group R10.Suitable formylating agents and reaction conditions are as hereinbefore defined.The compounds of the present invention may also suitably be prepared by reacting a compound of formula XIII EMI25.1 wherein R1, R2, R3 and R10 are as defined hereinbefore and wherein any reactive groups may be protected andR12 is a leaving group with a thiol of formula Y SH with the proviso that when R12 is an acyloxy group CO2R10 must be in the free acid form or a salt thereof.Suitable leaving groups R12 include halogen such as iodide or bromide or an acyloxy groups such as, fbr example the acetyloxy group.The thiol Y SH may be reacted as the free compound or a salt with an alkali metal such as sodium or potassium. This reaction is desirably conducted in a solvent. For example, use can be made of water, or organic solvents inert to the starting compounds, such as dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, dioxane, acetone, alcohol, 1,2 dichloroethane, acetonitrile, dimethylsulfoxide or tetrahydrofuran, or mixtures thereof. The reaction temperature and time depend, among other factors, upon the starting compounds and solvent to be employed but generally the reaction is carried out at a selected temperature within the range of 0 to 100 C for a selected time of a few hours to several days. The reaction is desirably conducted between pH 3 and 7.To prevent oxidation of the thio compounds it is advantageous to carry out the reaction in an inert gaseous atmosphere, eg nitrogen gas.From the foregoing it will be appreciated that the compounds of VI and protected derivatives thereof are valuable intermediates and form another preferred aspect of the present invention.Specific compounds within formula, VI include the following or a salt thereof 7ss Amino 3 ttl carboxymethyl lH tetrazol 5 yl thiomethyll 7 formamidoceph 3 em 4 carboxylic acid bis diphenylmethyl ester 7ss Amino 3 1 carbamoylmethyl lH tetrazol 5 yl thiomethyl 7a formamidoceph 3 em 4 carboxylic acid or the diphenylmethyl ester thereof 7ss Amino 3 1 1 2 dimethylaminoethyl lH tetrazol 5 yl thiomethyl 7v formamidoceph 3 em 4 carboxylic acid or the diphenylmethyl ester thereof and 7ss amino 3 6 carbamoyl 2 methyl 5 oxo 4H 1,2,4 triazin 3 yl thiomet.hyl 7 formamidoceph 3 em 4 carboxylate or the diphenylmethyl ester thereof.The antibiotic compounds of the present invention are active against a wide range of gram negative and gram positive organisms including E.coli such as, for example ESS, JT4, JT425 and NCTC 10418 PseudomonasSpp. such as Ps.aeruginosa for example 10662 andDalgleish Serratia marcescens US32 Klebsiella aerogenes A Enterobacter cloacae N1 P.mirabilis such as, for example C977 and 889 P.morganii P.rettgeri B.subtilis Staph aureus such as, for example Oxford and Russell N.catarrhalis 1502 Strep faecalis I ss Haemolytic Strep CN10.
