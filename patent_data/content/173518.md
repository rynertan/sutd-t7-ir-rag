# Process for preparing uniformly sized polymer particles.

## Abstract
Spheroidal polymer beads having a uniform size are pre pared by polymerizing uniformly sized monomer droplets formed by vibratory excitation of a laminar jet of monomeric material flowing in a gas phase. For example, a laminar jet of a monomer mixture comprising styrene, divinylbenzene and a polymerization initiator can be subjected to vibratory excita tion and the resulting monomer droplets polymerized to yield copolymer beads having a narrow particle size range distribu tion. The copolymer beads can be employed in applications where beads having diameters of 5 µm to 100 µm are useful.
