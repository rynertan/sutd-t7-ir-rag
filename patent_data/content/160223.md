## Description
This invention relates to high frequency amplifier circuits. More particularly, it is concerned with high voltage, high frequency amplifier circuits employing power transistors. Transistor operating voltages are limited by inter region breakdown voltages, in the case of bipolar transistors BV Ideally, in order to achieve high output power transistors having high breakdown voltage capabilities would be employed with high supply voltages. High breakdown voltage and high frequency operation, however, are conflicting requirements in semiconductor device design. Because of the thin interaction regions within devices necessary in order to achieve high operating frequencies, high frequency devices have inherently low breakdown voltages. Therefore, in order to increase amplifier output power at high frequency operation, parallel active devices or parallel power amplifiers are commonly utilized. The drive power is divided and applied to the individual amplifying devices, and the output powers are then combined to achieve the desired power level. This arrangement provides a new higher power amplifier which operates at the same dc supply voltage but draws more dc current depending on the number of parallel power units. From Conference Proceedings 10th European Microwave Conference 1980, September 1980, pages 621 to 624, published by Microwave Exhibitions and Publishers Ltd., Sevenoaks, Kent, GB, 7 GHs GaAs FET power amplifier operating with 21 Vdc power supply without dc dc converter or voltage dropping resistor is known. Direct series connection of two power GaAs FETs is used to achieve a high voltage operating condition. Two transistors are connected in series and are biased by two resistors coupled to the source electrodes of the transistors. These resistors are passive components dissipating power. They are necessary to divide down the dc voltage of the power source to provide a proper supply voltage. From CA C 652 137 a transistor tone generator and power amplifier is known having three transistors connected in parallel, each biased by a common supply as a result of a voltage division across a pair of transistors. Thus, power dissipation is resulting therefrom as well when biasing the transistors. It is the object of the present invention to provide a high frequency amplifier having two transistors operating in parallel and to be driven from the same dc supply without dissipation of power in the common drive circuitry. This object is attained by the invention set forth in claim 1. Another solution is disclosed in claim 8. Preferred embodiments are subject matter of the respective dependant claims. In the amplifier of the invention, a dc conductive path is provided between the source of operating potential and the reference potential through the first transistor and the second transistor in series. The operating potential of the source is thus divided between the transistors by virtue of the dc series path such that each transistor shares the dc power equally, while separate parallel ac signal paths are provided through each transistor and combined at the output. In the drawings For a better understanding of the present invention, together with other and further objects, advantages and capabilities thereof, reference is made to the following disclosure and appended claims in connection with the above described drawings. Fig. 1 illustrates a high frequency amplifier circuit in accordance with the present invention. The circuit employs two junction field effect transistors JFETs Q1 and Q2 having substantially the same characteristics, more specifically, the transistors may be high power static induction transistors SITs . The circuit includes an RF input terminal 10 and an RF output terminal 11. An input matching network 12 matches the input impedance of the circuit to the output impedance of the circuitry or transmission line connected to the input terminal 10. Similarly, an output matching network 13 matches the output impedance of the circuit to the input impedance of the succeeding circuitry or transmission line connected to the output terminal 11. The input terminal 10 is coupled by way of the input matching network 12 and a coupling capacitance C1 to the source electrodes of the first and second transistors Q1 and Q2. A capacitance C4 is connected between the source electrodes of the transistors Q1 and Q2 to block the flow of dc current between them. The drain electrodes of the transistors Q1 and Q2 are coupled through an ac coupling capacitor C2 to the output matching network 13. A capacitance C3 is connected between the drain electrodes of the two transistors Q1 and Q2 to provide a block to dc current flow. A source of dc operating potential V The gate electrode of the second transistor Q2 is connected directly to ground. The source electrode of the second transistor Q2 is connected through an inductance L4 and a zener diode D2 to ground such that a positive bias potential is established at the source. An ac bypass capacitance C7 is connected from the juncture of the inductance L4 and the diode D2 to ground. The zener diode D2 establishes the dc biasing potential between the source and gate electrodes of the second transistor Q2. A single dc path is thus provided from the source of operating voltage V Although the amplifier circuit as illustrated in Fig. 1 employs JFETs, specifically of the SIT type, high frequency bipolar transistors together with suitable dc biasing arrangements may be employed. In addition, the circuitry may be utilized as a high frequency oscillator by suitably coupling the output to the input. A specific embodiment of the amplifier circuit as illustrated in Fig. 1 was constructed employing the following components The frequency of the input signal was 900 MHz, and the circuit produced 22 watts of output power with a gain of 10 db. Fig. 2 illustrates a modification of the circuit of Fig. 1 in which two transistors Q3 and Q4 are driven 180 out of phase in a push pull arrangement. In this circuit the ends of the primary winding of an input transformer 24 are connected to an input terminal 20 and ground. The ends of the secondary winding of the input transformer 24 are connected through an input matching network 22 to the source electrodes of the two transistors Q3 and Q4 by way of dc blocking capacitors C11 and C12. The center tap of the second winding of the transformer 24 is connected to ground. The drain electrodes of the transistors Q3 and Q4 are connected by way of dc blocking capacitances C13 and C14 and an output matching network 23 to the ends of the primary winding of an output transformer 25. The center tap of the primary winding of the output transformer 25 is connected to ground. The secondary winding of the output transformer 25 is connected between an RF output terminal 21 and ground. The push pull arrangement, illustrated in Fig. 2, reduces potential phasing differences within the two parallel ac paths through the amplifier circuit and provides a high voltage, high frequency amplifier with manageable impedance levels and with broadband frequency capability. Fig. 3 illustrates the manner in which an expanded amplifier circuit in accordance with the present invention can be constructed to provide N parallel ac amplifying paths with a single dc power supply path in series through N transistors. An RF input terminal 30 is connected through an appropriate input matching network 32 to several stages S1 SN. The outputs of the stages are connected together and through an output matching network 33 to an RF output terminal 31. Each of the stages S1... except the last stage SN in the plurality is similar to the stage employing the first transistor Q1 in the circuit of Fig.1. The last stage SN in the plurality of stages is similar to the stage employing the second transistor Q2 in the circuit of Fig. 1. Thus, the dc current path is from the source of operating voltage V While there has been shown and described what are considered preferred embodiments of the present invention, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the invention as defined by the appended claims.
