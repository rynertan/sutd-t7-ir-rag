# Copolymer dispersions in polyfunctional compounds having a plurality of active hydrogens, method of making the copolymer dispersions, and a polyurethane composition prepared therefrom.

## Abstract
A stable copolymer dispersion is prepared by addition copolymerization of 1 an adduct of an active hydrogen compound, for example, a polyether polyol, and an active ethylenically unsaturated isocyanate, for example, 2 iso cyanatoethyl methacrylate with 2 ethylenically unsaturat ed monomer s , for example, styrene or mixture thereof with acrylonitrile, while 1 and 2 are dispersed or dis solved in an excess of an active hydrogen polyfunctional compound. The resulting dispersion has a controlled par ticle size and a viscosity such that it is suitably employed in the production of polyurethane foams.
