# APPARATUS FOR MAINTAINING RESERVE BONDING WIRE

## Abstract
An apparatus is described for maintaining and delivering a slack reserve length of lead wire between a spool or other source and the wire bonding tool of a lead wire bonding machine. A slack chamber or wind chamber comprised of a housing enclosure, an inlet guide on one side for guiding lead wire into the slack chamber from a spool, an outlet guide on the other side for guiding lead wire out of the slack chamber towards the wird bonding tool maintains the reserve length of lead wire in untangled condition. A source of pressurized dry air or other gas directs a gaseous flow into the slack chamber so that the lead wire is maintained suspended in the gaseous flow in an offset configuration. Wire sensors are operatively positioned in the slack chamber for sensing the offset of lead wire in the wind stream. The wire sensors are coupled to sensor and control logic for controlling the delivery and feed ing of lead wire from a spool into the slack chamber. The wire sensors define inner and outer limits of offset thereby main taining the reserve length within a desired range. Additional elements for back up control of the lead wire and for handling the spool are described.
