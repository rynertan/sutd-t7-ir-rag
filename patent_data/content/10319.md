# Kit for applying and a method of transferring a design from a transfer sheet to a fabric.

## Abstract
A kit for applying a design, like a colored emblem, to a fabric, like a T shirt, comprises a transfer sheet 50 having an obverse surface 50A and a rear surface 50B with a pattern 52A to be transferred generated on the obverse surface, and a copy sheet 54 juxtaposed with said rear surface. The said copy sheet includes a substrate 58 of paper, plastic or the like and a surface layer 56 of pressure or heat transferable col ored material. When applying heat or pressure energy through said transfer sheet 50 to said substrate 58 a trans ferable mirror image 52B of said design is generated on the rear surface of the transfer sheet. The mirror image after having removed the transfer sheet from the copy sheet, may be transferred to a contiguous fabric, like a T shirt, in response to the application of energy to the obverse surface.
