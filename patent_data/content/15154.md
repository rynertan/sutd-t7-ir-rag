# Method of producing bearing cups by deep drawing.

## Abstract
Bearing cups manufactured by deep drawing and heat treating sheet or strip steel having a higher carbon content have good strength but the deep drawing step is difficult to carry out. If a low carbon content steel is used, the deep drawing becomes easier but the heat treating step does not produce a product having a satisfactorily high core strength. The product is improved by using a sheet or strip steel consisting of iron, carbon, boron, manganese, silicon, aluminium and titanium. The utilization of a low carbon con tent steel containing boron produces bearing cups having good strength after the heat treatment step. The utilization of a higher carbon content steel containing boron produces bearing cups having strengths superior to those made from corresponding steels not containing boron and without increased manufacturing difficulties.

## Description
DESCRIPTION tLT OD UF P ODUr IJT REARING OUPS BY DEEP D2A ..tTG 1 DRAWING The present invention relates to a method of deep drawing steel bearing cups, for example, needle bearing cups. Bearing cups nay be manufactured from a sheet or strip metal, for example a steel, utilizing a deepdrawing process to form the cup shape and a subsequent heat treatment step to give the formed cup the desired strength. However, when a sheet or stip steel is used to form the bearing cup, it is observed that the most suitable steel to give good formation on the cup press, utilized in the deep drawing process, is not the most suitable steel at the heat treatment stage and vice versa.For example, if a steel from which most of the carbon has been removed is used, the deep drawing of the cup becomes relatively easy but this loss of carbon would render the heat treatment process futile. A bearing cup would be produced that would have little or no resistance to pressure in service. Conversely, if extra carbon is added to the steel, for example to raise the carbon content to a level of 0.2 ,6 by weight or more, or if appreciable amounts of alloying elements such as nickel and chromium are added, the effect upon the heat treatment process would be dramatic. A very strong bearing cup would be formed.Unfortunately, apart from the higher cost of such a steel, it would be unsuitable for deep drawing into precision bearing cups on the cup press due to a lack of flow properties. In practice, a compromise between the above two extremes has been used where sufficient carbon and alloying elements are added to a steel to give a reasonably strong in va the forbid cap after the heat treatment stage without rendering the drawability of the steel impract cable. For e7 ample, steels containing from 0.1 to 0.15 by weight carbon, from 0.2 to 0.4 ó by weight nickel and from 0.2 to 0.4, 0 by weight chromium have been utilized.A steel containing approximately 0.12 by weight carbon, approximately 0.2 , by weight nickel and approximately 0 2 , by weight chromium may yield, on oil quenching, a bearing cup having a core strength of 52 to 60 tons in2 803 to 927 j a, MPa mega Pascals . Although the drawability of the steels mentioned in the preceding paragraph is not rendered impracticable, it has been found that the steel must be lubricated during the deep drawing stage in order to prevent cracking and to preserve the dimensional tolerance. Such lubrication of the steel surface has been achieved by coating the steel, prior to deep drawing, with copper or a phosphate or equivalent material. The necessity of providing a lubricant coating on the steel is a disadvantage because it increases the raw material costs and also the subsequent processing costs.The subsequent processing costs are increased since it is the practice, at present, to remove the lubricant coating before the heat treatment step. The necessity of providing a lubricant coating, e.g.a copper or phosphate coating, on the surface of the steel can be avoided if a steel having a lower carbon content, is used. For example, a steel with a carbon content of approximately 0.07,0 by weight, a nickel content of approximately 0.13 by weight and a chromium content of approximately 0.166 by weight would enable the lubricant coating to be dispensed with and a bearing cup would be produced having a lower core strength, e.g., of the order of 38 to 45 tons in2 587 to 695 IvEE , after heat treatment. It would be a considerable economic advantage to a bearing manufacturer if the costs of raw materials and also the subsequent process costs could be reduced by avoiding the need to coat the steel with a lubricant such as copper or phosphate, whilst at the same tine producing a bearing cup having a satisfactory core strength. By practice of the present invention there may be provided a steel bearing cup having a satisfactory strength and which is produced without the use of a lubricant, for example copper or phosphate, coating on the steel. By practice of the present invention there may also be provided a steel bearing cup having improved strength properties but which is produced using a steel coated with a lubricant such as copper or a phosphate. According to the present invention there is provided a method of manufacturinb a bearing cup by deep trawing a sheet or strip steel to form a cup shaped structure and sub sequently subjecting said cup shaped structure to a heat treatment step, characterised in that the steel used for the sheet or strip consists of iron, carbon, manganese, silicon, boron, aluminium and titanium together with incidental constituents and impurities. The heat treatment step may, for example, be carried out at a temperature of from d40 to q000C. A temperature of about 880 0C is particularly preferred for the heat treatment step. The boron, which is present in the steel used in accordance with the present invention, may be present in an amount of from 0,or1 to 0.004r, by weight, for example from 0.0015 to 0.003 by weight. The titanium content of the steel used in accordance with the present invention may be up to 0.1 by weight, for example 0.03 to 0.0550 by weight, and the aluminium content of the steel may be upto 0,1cm by weight, for example from 0.02 to 0.06Cv by weight. Th carbon content of the steel utilized in the present invention is typically from 0.05 to 0.15so by weight. If the carbon content of the steel utilized is in the range of from 0.1 to 0.15 by weight, then the steel should be provided with a lubricant coating, for example a copper or phosphate coating, prior to the deep drawing stage since otherwise difficulties may be encountered during the deep drawing stage. The utilization of a steel in accordance with the present invention and having a carbon content in the range of from 0.1 to 0.15 by weight will produce a bearing cup having a high core strength, for example a core strength exceeding 75 tons in2 1160 MPa whereas a similar steel but without the addition of boron may only produce a bearing cup having a core strength of 48 to 65 tons in2 741 to 1004 PUPa . If the carbon content of the steel utilized in the present invention is from 0.05 to 0.1 vó by weight, for example, 0.05 to 0.08 by weight, it is not necessary to provide a lubricant coating on the surface thereof prior to the deep drawing step since it will form well in the cup press used for the deep drawing and, despite the lower carbon content, will give a satisfactory core strength after the heat treatment stage. In fact, the use of a lubricant coating on the surface of the sheet or strip steel may prove to be economically disadvantageous since it will increase the raw material costs and probably also increase the subsequent processing costs. The manganese content of the steel used in the present invention may be up to 1.2 by weight, e.g., from 0.3 to 1.2 by weight, and preferably from 0.3 to 0.6of by weight. The silicon content of the steel used in accordance with the present invention may be from 0.1 to 0.25 by weight. In addition to containing iron, carbon, manganese, silicon, aluminium, titaniun and boron, the steel used in accordance with the present invention may also contain one or more incidental impurities such as sulphur, phosphorous, nickel, chromium, copper or molybdenum. lor example, when present in the steel, sulphur nay be present in an amount of up to 0.025 by weight, phosphorous may be present in an amount of up to 0.025,cm by weight, nickel may be present in an amount of up to 0.4 by weight, e.g., up to 0.2 by weight, chromium may be present in an amount of up to 0.4 by weight, e.g., up to 0.2 by weight, copper may be present in an amount of up to o.35o o by weight, and. molybdenum may be present in an amount of up to 0.1 by weight.If desired, steels may be used having a nickel content of from 0.2 to 0.4 by weight and or a chromium content of from 0.2 to 0.lcz by weight. The above mentioned incidental impurities are not always added intentionally to the steel but may be unavoidably present. The following three compositions A, B and C illustrate steel compositions suitable for use in the present invention. In each of the compositions the percentages are by weight based on the total weight of the steel Composition A Carbon 0.05 0.1 h Manganese 0.3 1.2 Silicon 0.1 0. 25ó Aluminium Up to O.lCó Titanium Up to 0.1 Boron 0.001 0.004 , remainder, apart from any incidental impurities, iron. Composition 3 Carbon 0.05 0.08 Manganese se e 0.3 0.6 Silicon 0.1 0.25 Aluminium 0.02 0.06 Titanium 0.03 0.05 Boron 0.0015 0.003 remainder, apart from any incidental impurities, iron.Composition C Carbon 0.1 0.15 Manganese Up to 1.2 Aluminium Up to 0.1 Titanium Up to 0 1 Boron 0.001 0.004 Silicon 0.1 0.25 Nickel 0.2 0.4 Chromium 0.2 0.4 remainder, apart from any incidental impurities, iron. The incidental imparities which may be present in compositions A and B above may comprise one or more of the following materials in the amounts indicated.Percentages quoted are percentages by weight based on the total weight of the steel Sulphur 0.025 maximum Phosphorous 0.0255,0 maximum Nickel 0. 2 maximum Chromium 0.2 maximum Copper 0.35 maximum Molybdenum 0.1 maximum The incidental impurities which may be present in composition C above may comprise one or more of the following materials in the amounts indicated.Again, percentages quoted are percentages by weight based on the total weight of the steel Sulphur 0.025 maximum Phosphorous 0.025 maximum dipper 0.35 maximum Nolybdenum 0.1 maximum Compositions A and B above have a carbon content of from 0.05 to 0.1 by weight and may, therefore, be used to produce a bearing cup having a satisfactory core strength without the need to provide a lubricant coating, such as a copper or phosphate coating, on the surface of the steel before the deep drawing step. Composition C, however, has a carbon content of from 0.1 to 0.15 by weight and a lubricant coating should be provided on the surface of the steel strip or sheet prior to deep drawing. A commercially available steel which may be modified to produce a steel suitable for use in the present invention is SAE 1012. It has been found that boron, in very low concentrations, may produce a substantial increase in the hardenability of steel at the heat treatment, for example quenching, stage. That is to say, the depth to which hardening will occur when the steel is heat treated will increase for certain steels when boron is added. This same effect can also be achieved by adding appreciable amounts of alloy elements such as nickel and chromium.For example, to achieve the same hardenability effect as adding from 0.001 to 0.004 by weight of boron, greater concentrations of nickel and chromium above 0.2 by weight would be necessary. However, such concentrations of nickel and chromium would reduce the drawability of the steel. The hardenability effect attained by adding boron to the steel allows the carbon content of the steel to be reduced without forfeiting the hardening depth of the steel, provided the amount of boron present is controlled. Alternatively, a bearing cup having an increased strength may be produced when the carbon content of the steel is not reduced, e.g., the carbon content is in the range of from 0.1 to 0.15,by weight, and a controlled amount of boron is present. The presence of titanium and aluminium in the steel is necessary in order to assist the boron to fulfil its hardenability function by offsetting the detrimental effect to the boron of nitrogen which may also be present in the steel. In conclusion, by reducing the carbon content of a steel to below 0.1 by weight and adding boron with other protective elements such as aluminium and titanium , a superior steel for bearing cup manufacture nay be produced. This steel would form.well in the cup press used in the deep drawing process without the need for a lubricant coating, for example a copper or phosphate coating, and, despite the lower carbon content, would give a satisfactory core strength at the heat treatment stage. The lower carbon content of the steel would promote earier manufacture of the bearing cup, whereas the boron would give the cup a satisfactory core strength after heat treatment. An equivalent steel but without boron would not achieve a satisfactory core strength.For example, a steel having 0.07 by weight carbon, 0.15 , by weight nickel, and 0.16 by weight chromium would give, after heat treatment, a core strength of only of the order of 38 45 tons in2 58 to 695 spa and this low core strength would produce a weak bearing cup although the steel would not require a lubricant coating for drawing. ty utilizing a steel having a carbon content of from 0.1 to 0.15 ó by weight and adding boron, a bearing cup may be produced having a core strength superior to that which could be obtained by utilizing a similar steel but without added boron. However, a lubricant coating should be used, in this embodiment, during the drawing stage. In heavy load applications this increased core strength may give a considerable extension to the bearing life.
