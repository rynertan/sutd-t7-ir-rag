# Venturi flow measuring device and method.

## Abstract
A planar venturi is located at the discharge of an air conditioning unit to form a part of the unit and to stabilize flow. A plurality of sensor locations 50 53 are provided in the diverging portion of the venturi such that a velocity sensor 62 can be located in the sensor location appropriate for the highest range of sensor accuracy. The velocity is a measure of the volume flow which is the product of the cross section of the flow at the sensor location and the sensed velocity.
