# Fuel supply systems.

## Abstract
A fuel supply system for use in rotary wing aircraft is described. The system comprises a separating means 10 for receiving an air, vapour and fuel mixture at relatively low pressure from a fuel tank separating the air and the vapour from the mixture and providing a fuel supply at a relatively high pressure, and a pump means 12 for returning the separated air and vapour to the tank.
