# Postage metering system with programmable prompts.

## Abstract
A post office window system having two modes of operation and comprising a scale 10 having a load cell 12 for providing an analog output proportional to the weight of an item to be mailed, circuitry 14 for providing a digital signal corresponding to the analog signal, a scale CPU 16 for receiving the digital signal, for processing the digital signal to determine the weight of the item to be mailed, and for transmitting that weight, a processor 22 operatively connected to the scale 10 , to a keyboard 40 and display 30 , and to a postage meter 50 . In the normal mode of operation, the processor 22 computes the appropriate postage value for the item to be mailed from the item s weight and from information entered by an operator through the keyboard 40 and transmits that value to a postage meter 50 which prints appropriate indicia. The processor 22 also displays messages, or prompts on the display 30 to elicit the necessary information from the operator. In the second, or editing, mode, which is entered in response to a command from the operator, the operator may selectively edit all or portions of the prompts so that the edited prompts will be displayed upon return to the normal mode. In one embodiment, prompts include protected fields which may not be edited by the operator.
