## Description
METHOD Ai D APPA1 STES FOR THE PRODUCTION OF FIBRES AND FIBRES THEREBY PRODUCED The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for the producticn of fibres from molten material. A principal field in which the invention may be used is the production of glass fibres.One method for producing fibres is to provide a container of molten material having one or more orifices in the base of the container, which may therefore be constituted by a perforate plate, and to allow the molten material to exude through the orifices so that when a sufficient amount of material has exuded through an orifice the drop so formed falls from the exposed underside of the container trailing a fibre of solidified material which may then be continuously drawn as fresh material exudes through the orifice. There will bs a tendency for the separate drops of material exuding through adjacent orifices to wet the underside of the container and to spread across the underside of the container and join up so that the underside of the container becomes flooded with liquid material. This would prevent the formation of fibres. In order to avoid this, one may provide cach orifice with a nozzle projecting frown the downstream side of the container.The use of nozzles is in some ways undesirable. The flow rate of liquid through a nozzle will, all other factors being equal, be less than the flow rate through a shorter orifice. The formation of nozzles necessarily involves the use of a considerable extra amount of the material of which the container is formed. In the formation of glass fibres, the container, own as a bushing, is typically an electrically healed platinum furnace of very great cost and it is highly desirable to use as little material in the manufacture of the bushing as possible. The present invention now provides apparatus for the production of fibres from a molten liquid comprising a plate having orifices therein through which in use the molten liquid passes downwardly to form the fibres, each orifice having a projection extending therefrom in the direction of liquid flow around which the liquid flows in forming a fibre. The apparatus may be for use in the production of glass fibres from molten glass and will then be constructed of such materials and in such a manner as to be suitable for this particular purpose. Preferably, the plate is a base plate of a container for the molten liquid provided with means for heating the container. The contaiaer may be electrically conductive and the means for heating the container may be means for electrical resistance heating which may employ the passage of electric current through the container itself. The container may be of platinum or a platinum alloy and may be an electrically heaved furnace constructed from one of these materials. Platïnumbrhodium alloy is the preferred material for use for making bushings for use in forming glass fibres. The projection of each orifice may comprise a wire which may extend at least part way through its respective orifice and project therefrom Preferably, each projection extends from substantially the centre of the downstream opening of its respective orifice. The projection may alno be of platinum or of a platinum alloy. This should be preferred for the manufacture of glass fibres. Preferably, the downsrecun face of the plate is substantially smooth. The apparatus may further comprise means for producing a flow of cooling air directed toward the downstream openings of the orifices. The invention includes a method of forming fibres from molten liquid which method comprises passing the molten liquid do a 7ardly through orifices in the base of a container so that the liquid falls from each orifice forming a fibre of solidified material, wherein each orifice has a projection extending therefrom in the direction of liquid flow around which the liquid flows in forming a fibre, which projection, in the case of the fibre formation being interrupted, acts as a guide for liquid passing. through the orifice and reducers the tendency for the liquid to wet the underside of the container bse 2. The invention also includes fibres produced by a method as described above or using an apparatus as described above including glass fibres. The invention will now be illustrated by the description of particular embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 shows the orifice of a first prior art apparatus, Figure 2 shows orifices of a second prior art apparatus, Figure 3 shows the general arrangement of orifices in the base plate of a bushing of a prior art apparatus, Figure 4 shows the wetting of the underside of the base plate of the apparatus of Figure 2 which may occur in use, Figure 5 shows the orifices of an apparatus according to the present invention, Figure 6 shows the operation of the apparatus ofFigure 5, Figure 7A is a view from below of one orifice of the apparatus of Figure 6, Figure 7B is a view from below of one orifice of a further apparatus of the invention, Figure 8 shows orifices of a further embodiment of an apparatus according to the invention, and Figure 9 shows orifices of further apparatus according to the invention. Figure 1 shows a section through one orifice 1 of a bushing for use in forming glass fibres. The bushing is an electrically heated furnace having a base plate 2 containing a multitude of nozzles 1. In use the bushing is filled with liquid glass which is kept molten by heating the bushing by electric resistance heating, the current passing through the platinum bushing itself.Typically, the dimensions of each orifice of a bushing as shown in Figure 1 are in the ranges 11 2 6 mm 12 3 6 mm 2r 1 2.5 mmThe rate of flow of liquid, e.g. molten glass, thrcugh such a nozzle is given by Poiseuille s equation as 4 F h ql where F is the rate of flow in unit time, r is the radius of the nozzle or orifice bore in its narrowest section, 1 is the length of this narrowest cylindrical section, h is the height of the glass above the outlet of the nozzle or orifice, and tt is the viscosity of the glass. From this equation, it follows that, for a given rate of flow, that is a given output of glass fibre orifices with a shorter length 1 will not need so great a bore r. Furthermore, it is generally recognised that the smaller the orifice or nozzle, the closer they may be located one to another. The size of bushiugg is therefcre governed by the number of nozzles in its base plate and the necessary space between them as well as the need to provide for access during manufacture and use and for ancillary eqiinent As a typical example, the base or orifice plate of a bushing such as is shown in Figure 1 operating from a supply of molten glass and provided with 400 nozzles is about 340 mm long and 52 mm wide. The bushing, with sidewalls 50 mm high, terminals for connection to the electrical supply and other facilities contains about 2.1 kg of platinum metal.This, at current costs, has a value of about 15,000. Attempts have been made to reduce the amount of platinum metal used for a given output of glass fibre.Some success has been achieved in this direction, in the main by constructing bushings provided with more and more nozzles, and dealing at the same time with the related problems of handling the larger number of simultaneuosly drawn glass fibres. Bushings of several thousand nozzles are now in use. These bushings have necessitated development of new auxiliary equipment for handling the larger bundle of fibres they produce and the reduction in weight of platinum metals employed per unit weight of fibre produced has not been so great as to remove the need for further savings. It has been proposed to use bushings in which the orifices are not provided with a nozzle. An example of such a prior art hushing is shown in Figure 2 and it will be seen that each orifice i opens into a smocth downstream surface of the bushing base plate 2 i.e. no nozzle is provided. A fibre of solidified glass may be drawn continuously from a continuously replenished meniscus of molten glass 3 It was originally proposed that bushings without nozzles should be used in conjunction with a pressurised supply of molten glass to further increase the rate of production of glass fibre. This however has not been put into commercial practice.When using a bushing of the type shown in Figure 2 a flow of cooling air is directed at the outlets of the orifices to accelerate the cooling of glass as the fibres are drawn therefrom. The change from bushings as shown in Figure 1 to bushings of the kind described with reference to Figure 2 has resulted in the reduction of the size of the bushing and a considerable saving in material. A major problem with such bushings as are illustrated by Figure 2 is that they are prone to the flooding of the orifice plate by molten glass when one or more filaments break during the production process. It is inherent in the industrial process of making glass in a refractory furnace from natural raw materials dlat. impurities or inhomogeneities are occasionally present in the molten glass. Even very small particles in the glass, or inhomogeneities which would go unnoticed in normal ylassmaking are sufficient to reduce the flow of glass through one or more nozzles and holes to such a level that the fibre breaks.Additionally, it is possible that some event downstream from the exit of the glass from the bushing, like passage over a guide surface, is defective and causes simultaneous breakage of several fibres which, in turn, can lead to all the fibres breaking. In the case of the traditional bushing shown in Figure 1 this is an undesirable event but not a major problem. By waiting for. 30 60 seconds, drops of glass will form, one from each nozzle, drop away from the orifice plate, and leave single fibres attached to the nozzles, one to each nozzle. The operator can handle this bundle of fibres and manually restart the fibre forming process. In the case of the form of bushing shown in Figure 2, such events can lead to major problems due to the tendency of the glass to wet and flow across the underside of the orifice plate and join up with other fibres in the case of many fibres breaking simultaneously, the whole orifice plate can become flooded with glass. A long period of work by expert operators is then required to restore the bushing to a condition when production can recommence. The flooding is basically due to the low surface tension between platintirn alloys and molten glass. Figure 4 shows the effect of fibre breakage and the flooding of the orifice plate that results therefrom dotted area . Figure 3 shows the base plate of a bushing as illustrated in detail in Figure 2. Air blowers 7 provided with nozzles 6 direct a cooling flow of air towards the outlets of the orifices. The orifices can be seen to be arranged in groups. This is one method of minimising the consequences of a fibre breakage since the flooding is likely to spread somewhat more slowly between adjacent groups of orifices and between individual orifices within a group. By contrast Figure 5 shows in c ross section a pair of orifices of a bushing according te the present invention.The bushing is generally similar to that shown in Figure 2 except that each orifice is provided with a projection 5 which in Figure 5 is a platinum wire centrally disposed along the axis of each respective orifice and projecting from the downstream opening of the orifice. In the event of one or more fibres breaking, flooding of the orifice plate by molten glass will often be prevented by the projections 5 which conduct the molten glass away from the orifice plate 2. This process is shown in Figure 6. At orifice A the fibre is broken but glass begins to flow onto the projecting wire 5. At orifice B, a drop of glass is formed which, at orifice C is shown dropping away leaving a fibre being drawn continuously from the meniscus around the wire. This fibre, together with the other fibres, may be gathered manually and attached to mechanical means fo attenuation for the production process to continue. It may be that some mishap will cause the glass to flood the underside of the pl te despite the projections this can occur even when nozzles are used. In this eventuality however, the removal of unianted glass is facilitated by the fact that, as the glass is removed by manual attenuation, the fiDn of glass on the underside will contract and concentrate onto the projections to which fresh glass flows from within the container and from which it will continue to be drawn. Using an arrangement similar to that shown in Figure 3, an air flow may be directed at the outlets of the orifices of an apparatus according to the invention to assist in cooling the liquid material being drawn into fibres therc through. Figures 7A and 7B illustrate two methods of attaching a projection 5 in the fprm of a wire so as to lie along the centre line of an orifice in the base place of a bushing. Figure 7A shows the central wire 5 supported by a pair of wire arms 9 extending in opposed radial directions to the walls of the orifice. Figure 7B shows the central wIre 5 supported by three radial arms 9 in a similar manner. Pa.gure 8 shows two orifices in the base plate of a further apparatus according to the inven ,ón which generally resembles that of Figure 6 except that the supporting wire arms 9 for the projection 5 are shaped as a catenary whereas in Figure 6 they are shown as being horizontal and straight.Figure 9 shows a similar orifice plate to that shown inFigure 8 but illustrates an alternative placing of the support arms 9 at i lle top surface of the respective orifice rather than In the bore. The length by which each projection in n an apparatus according to the invention should extend below the downstream surface of the plate in order to prevent wetting of the surface in the event of fibre formation being . interrupted, e.g. by an interruption of flow, will depend upon several factors including the nature of the molten liquid, the diameter of the orifice, and the amount and direction of any air flow provided for cooling the liquid as it emerges as fibres. In the case of glass being drawn into fibres, it is preferred that the wire have 2. length in the range from the radius of the orifice to the diameter of the orifice. Although each projection is most preferably a single wire lying along the axis of its respective orifice, the use of a plurality of projections, e.g. two in each orifice is permissible and the projections may take form other than wires, e.g. fine tubes However, it will generally be undesirable to produce any more than the minimum obstruction of each orifice.
