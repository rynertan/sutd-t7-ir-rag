# Drive system for a movable apparatus.

## Abstract
The robot 1 comprises a hand 4 , a force sensor 5 , an X axis base 6 , a Z axis base 7 and a Y axis base 8 . A control circuit for the robot includes a memory unit 11 for storing teaching and other data, and a microprocessor 12 which reads out the teaching data from the memory, generates a motion route command for the hand, sends motion route data to a position control unit 13 , and sends open and close commands to the hand via a hand open close unit 17 . The microprocessor also generates teaching data in response to hand positions detected by a hand position detection unit 14 and stores the teaching data in the memory. A position control unit 13 feeds out a plurality of pulses V
