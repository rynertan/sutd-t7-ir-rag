# Fluid bearings.

## Abstract
A hydrostatic journal bearing with two opposed bearing pads in which the typical tendency of the bearing clearance to change due to variation in the viscosity of the operating fluid, brought about by temperature change, is counteracted by causing the sum of the pressures p₁, p₂ existing at the two pads 22, 23 to be held to a constant value. Typically this value is equal to that of the pressure p₂ of the supply 27 . The supply may be connected to the two pads by way of separate adding valves 40, 29 which may be arranged in parallel with restrlctors 41, 28 which are themselves in series with the pressure source 27 . Such restrictors may be fixed but may also with advantage be controlled by reference to the pressure existing at their respective pads 22, 23 , provided they respond symmetrically to variations of fluid temperature and so give rise to no change in the relative position of the bearing members in response to such variations. Alternatively only a single adding valve may be used, which advantageously may provide a third, reference output pressure p₀ suoplied to the pads 22, 23 in parallel with their respective basic pressure supplies p₁, p₂ .
