# Branched styrene butadiene copolymers and pneumatic tires using the same.

## Abstract
A branched styrene butadiene copolymer is produced by coupling an active styrene butadiene copolymer anion, which is obtained by polymerizing styrene and butadiene in a hydrocarbon solvent in the presence of ether or a tertiary amine and an initiator comprising an organolithium com pound, with a tin halide compound. In the copolymer, the ratio of branched polymer connected with tin butadienyl bonds is at least 20 by weight, and the content of bound styrene is not less than 3 by weight but less than 25 by weight, and the content of vinyl bonds in the butadiene portion is not less than 30 but less than 50 . There is also disclosed a pneumatic tire having a tread base rubber which contains at lest 20 parts by weight of a branched styrene butadiene copolymer rubber produced by coupling a styrene butadiene copolymer anion with a tin halide.
