# Method and system of drilling deviated wellbores.

## Abstract
Directional drilling is carried out with a rotary drilling tool having a drill string 21 , a drill bit 19 , a drill motor 31 for rotating the drill bit independently of the drill string, and a bent sub 30 affixed between the lower end of the drill string and the drill motor for angularly displacing the axis of rotation of the drill bit from the axis of rotation of the drill string. Both the drill string and drill bit are rotated to provide a straight path for the wellbore, while only the drill bit is rotated during the deviation of the wellbore from a straight path.
