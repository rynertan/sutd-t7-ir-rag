# Adjustable support for display monitor.

## Abstract
An adjustable support for a display monitor includes a turntable 8 to allow swivelling and carrying a pair of sup port tubes 18 and 19 on which is mounted a slidable sup port beam 25 . A carrier 34 having cylindrical bearing surfaces co operates with skid pads 31 on the support beam. By sliding the carrier 34 with respect to the support beam 25 the angle of the carrier 34 and hence the angle of the display screen can be varied. A non magnetic gas strut 21 located in one of the support tubes compensates for the weight of the monitor carrier assembly. The force exerted by the gas strut 21 is shared between the support tubes by means of a pair of coupled rack and pinions 49, 50 which also allow convenient height adjustment of the support beam 25 , carrier 34 and display monitor.
