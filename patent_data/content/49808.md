# Method of stabilizing hydrogen peroxide solutions.

## Abstract
A method of stabilizing aqueous hydrogen peroxide solutions against decomposition catalyzed by a combination of iron and copper consists of adding to the solution an amount of alkali metal meta and pyrophosphates effective to prevent decomposition and adjusting the pH of the solution to 2 4.
