# LOW VISCOSITY ADDUCTS OF A POLY ACTIVE HYDROGEN ORGANIC COMPOUND AND A POLYEPOXIDE

## Abstract
This invention is directed to adducts of a poly active hydrogen organic compound and a polyepoxide comprising the reaction product of a poly active hydrogen organic compound and a polyepoxide containing two or more epoxy groups per molecule, said poly active hydrogen organic compound being employed in an amount at least sufficient to effect substantially complete reaction of the epoxy groups of the polyepoxide. The adducts are useful in the formulation of high solids coating compositions, polyurethane elasto mers, inks, sealants, adhesives and the like.
