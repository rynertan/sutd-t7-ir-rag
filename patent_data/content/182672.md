# CONVERTIBLE FURNITURE

## Abstract
A frame 10 has connected thereto a table 12 and a pair or benches 14 and 16 on either side thereof. The table 12 is mounted on telescopic tubes 64 and may be lowered so that the surfaces of the table and benches are generally coexten sive to provide a double bed. Prior to lowering the table into the double bed configuration the bench 16 is slid away from the frame 10, and the table 12 pivoted through 180 so that its reverse upholstered side faces upwardly. The bench 14 may be pivoted downwardly to lie flat with the frame. The table 12 and bench 16 may be pivoted about 25 to lie in the region of the frame, either to be flat therewith or to provide upwardly facing surfaces, for instance for bunk beds.
