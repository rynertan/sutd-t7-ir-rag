SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention concerns a photosensitive composition comprising the following components i about 10 to 90 percent by total weight of components i , ii , and iii , of a polyene having a number average molecular weight of about 1,000 to 25,000, said polyene containing a about 20 to 1000 milliequivalents of reactive unsaturated carbon to carbon groups per 100 g of polyene, and b about 10 to 50 mole percent of N alkenylmaleimide units in which the alkenyl group contains.about 3 to 18 carbon atoms ii about 5 to 50 percent by total weight of components i , ii , and iii , of a reactive mercapto acid and iii about 0.1 to 50 percent by total weight of components i , ii , and iii of a radiation sensitive, radical generating system, activatable by actinic radiation to initiate addition of the mercapto acid to the polyene. This invention also concerns a photosensitive element which comprises a substrate coated with a layer of the photosensitive composition having a thickness in the range of about 0.1 vm to 7600 vm or more. The preferred photosensitive elements are used as photoresists and proofing systems. The substrate can be any natural or synthetic support, preferably one capable of existing in flexible or rigid film or sheet form This invention also concerns a method of photoimaging which comprises imagewise exposing a photosensitive element to actinic radiation containing wavelengths of 2000 to 5000 A through an image bearing transparency, and developing the image. The term reactive unsaturated carbon to carbon groups means groups which react under actinic radiation, in the presence of a photosensitizer, with the thiol group of a mercapto acid to yield the thioether linkage,EMI4.1 as contrasted with the unreactive groups,EMI4.2 found in aromatic nucleii such as cyclic structures exemplified by benzene, pyridine, naphthalene, and the like, which do not under the same conditions react with the thiol group to give thioether linkages. The term unsaturated carbon to carbon groups means EMI4.3 EMI5.1 The polyene can contain one type of such unsaturated group or it can contain two or more such types. The polyene, component i of the photosensitive composition, has a preferred number average molecular weight of about 1,000 to 10,000 and a preferred degree of unsaturation of about 50 to 500 milliequivalents of reactive unsaturated carbon to carbon groups per 100 grams of polyene. Preferred quantities of polyene are about 40 to 80 percent of the total weight of components i , ii , and iii . It is preferred that substantially all of the reactive unsaturated carbon to carbon groups be contained in the N alkenylmaleimide units.Preferably, these unsatur ated groups are terminal , i.e., at the end of the N alkenyl chain. Preferred polyenes contain at least one group selected frÏm C CH2 and CH CH2 because of their high reactivity. Particularly preferred areN alkenylmaleimide containing polyenes derived from copolymers of styrene and maleic anhydride. The preferred mercapto acids are mercaptocarboxylic acids. Preferablyr the mercapto acid is present in an amount from about 10 to 40 percent by total weight of components i , ii , and iii r The radical generating system is preferably present at about 1 to 20 percent by total weight of components i , ii , and iii . The preferred radical generating system comprises benzoin ethers, especially benzil dimethyl ketal. For high quality imaging applications, it has been found most beneficial to employ photosensitive elements that contain photosensitive layers having about 50 to 100 of the photosensitive composition described herein. The balance of the photosensitive layer, up to 50 by total weight of the layer, can be comprised of materials added to improve physical properties without contributing to photosensitivity. The photosensitive compositions of this invention have utility in lithographic printing, gravure images, preparation of printing plates for offset and letter press, engineering drafting films, photoresists in making printed circuits or in chemical milling, solder masks, flexographic printing, microimages for information storage, and decoration of paper, glass, and metal packages.Other specific uses will be evident to those skilled in the art. Because the compositions are single exposure, monomer free, and positive working using aqueous solvent washout development, they are particularly useful in positive working photoresist applications. Photosensitive compositions based on the preferred N alkenylmaleimide containing polyenes, i.e., those derived from copolymers of styrene and maleic anhydride, are outstanding when used in positive working photoresist applications compared with previously used compositions. They exhibit a significantly improved combination of such properties as photospeed, semiaqueous processability and physical properties as well as excellent reimageability. DETAILS OF THE INVENTION Polvenes i Examples of suitable N alkenylmaleimidecontaining polyenes include those derived from copolymers of maleic anhydride with such monomers as styrene, a methylstyrene, p chlorostyrene, p methylstyrene, p bromostyrene, and other substituted styrenes acrylate esters such as methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, allyl methacrylate, and butyl methacrylate butadiene ethylene methyl vinyl ether, ethyl vinyl ether, isopropyl vinyl ether, 2 ethylhexyl vinyl ether, and butyl vinyl ether. The polyenes of the invention can be prepared by reaction of a suitable maleic anhydride copolymer with an excess of N alkenylamine by the general procedure described in U.S. Patents 3,857,822 and 3,905,820. Mercapto Acids ii The contemplated mercapto acids are those that contain a single thiol, SH, functional group.Suitable mercapto acids include mercaptocarboxylic acids, mercaptosulfonic acids, mercaptophosphonic acids, and mercaptophenols. Particularly preferred mercaptocarboxylic acids are those of the structure HS R CO2 H wherein R is alkylene of 1 to 18 carbons, unsubstituted, or substituted with carboxyl or C to C6 alkoxycarbonyl groups. Suitable mercapto acids are Mercaptoacetic acid 3 Mercaptopropionic acid 2 Me rcaptopropionic acid Mercaptosuccinic acid 6 Mercaptocaproic acid Mercaptoitaconic acid 2 Mercaptocapro c acid 4 Mercaptomethylbenzoic acid 4 Mercaptomethylphenylpropionic acid li Mercaptoundecanoic acid 9 Mercaptostearic acid Mercaptododecylsuccinic acid 2 Mercaptoethanesulfonic acid 3 Mercaptopropanesulfonic acid 4 Mercaptobutanesulfonic acid Mercaptomethylphosphonic acid 2 2 Mercaptoethyl phenol 2 3 Mercaptopropyl phenol Mercaptosuccinic acid, monomethyl ester Mercaptosuccinic acid, mono n hexyl ester Mercaptosuccinic acid, mono 2 ethoxyethyl ester N Acetylcysteine 12 Mercaptododecanoic acid. Radical Generating System iii Practically any radiation sensitive, radical generating sysem which initiates addition of the mercapto acid to the reactive unsaturated carbon to carbon groups of the polyene is suitable for use in the photosensitive composition of this invention.Because process transparencies transmit heat originating from conventional sources of actinic radiation the preferred radical generating compounds are inactive thermally below about 850C, and more preferably below about 185 C. They should be dispersible in the composition to the extent necessary for initiating the desired mercapto acid addition under the influence of the amount of radiation absorbed in relatively short term exposures. The radical generating system absorbs radiation of about 2000 to 5000 A and has at least one component that has an active radiation absorption band with a molar extinction coefficient of at least about 50 within the range of about 2000 to 5000 A.The term reactive radiation absorption band means a band of radiation which is active to produce the radicals necessary to initiate addition of the mercapto acid to the reactive unsaturated carbon to carbon groups of the polyene. The radical generating system can be composed of one or more compounds which furnish radicals directly when subject to radiation.Alternatively, the system can contain sensitizers together with compounds which yield radicals after having been caused to do so by the radiation activatable sensitizer S . A large number of radical generating compounds can be utilized in the practice of the invention, including aromatic ketones such as benzophenone, Michler s ketone 4,4 bis dimethylamino benzophenone , 4,4 bis diethylamino benzophenone, 4 methoxy 4 dimethyl aminobenzophenone, 2 ethylanthraquinone, phenanthraquinone, 2 t butylanthraquinone, 1,2 benzanthraquinone, 2,3 benzanthraquinone, 2,3 dichloronaphthoquinone, benzil dimethyl ketal, desoxybenzoin, and other aromatic ketones benzoin, benzoin ethers such as benzoin methyl ether, methylbenzoin methyl ether, benzoin ethyl ether, benzoin isobutyl ether, and benzoin phenyl ether, methylbenzoin, ethylbenzoin and other benzoins and 2,4,5 triarylimidazolyl dimers such as 2 o chlorophenyl 4,5 diphenylimidazolyl dimer, 2 o chlorophenyl 4,5 di m methoxyphenyl imidazolyl dimer, 2 o fluorophenyl 4,5 diphenylimidazolyl dimer, o methoxyphenyl 4,5 diphenylimidazolyl dimer, 2 metho xyphenyl 4, 5 diphenylimidazolyl dimer, 2,4 di p methoxyphenyl 5 phenylimidazolyl dimer, 2 2,4 dimethoxyphenyl 4,5 diphenylimidazolyl dimer, and 2 methylmercaptophenyl 4 ,5 diphenylimidazolyl dimer. Other useful 2,4,5 triarylimidazolyl dimer radical generating systems are disclosed in U.S.Patents 3,479,185 and 3,784,557, and in BritishPatents 997,396 and 1,047,569. The imidazolyl dimers listed above can be used with a radical producing sensitizer such as 2 mercaptobenzoxazole, Leuco Crystal Violet or tris 4 diethylamino 2 methylphenyl methane. Such sensitizers as Michlerls ketone can also be employed therewith as can energy transfer dyes such as RoseBengal and Eosin Y. Other useful radical generating systems comprise cyclohexadienone compounds such as 4 methyl 4 tr ichloromethyl 2, 5 cyclohexadienone, 3, 4 dimethyl 4 tr ichloromethyl 2 , 5 cyclohexadienone, 4 dichloromethyl 4 methyl 2 , 5 cyclohexadienone, 2, 6 di tert butyl 4 methyl 4 trichloromethyl 2, 5 cyclohexadienone, and other 2,5 cyclohexadienones which contain a trichloromethyl group and an alkyl or aryl group at the 4 position. Such cyclohexadienones can be used with a sensitizer such as Michler s ketone.Additive Materials Materials that can be included with the photosensitive composition in the element s photosensitive layer include polymeric binder s which serve to strengthen the composition or adhere it to a substrate. Radiation transparent and film forming polymers are preferred. Examples of suitable binders are thermoplastic macromolecular organic polymers which have number average molecular weights of at least about 1500, preferably at least 4000, including such polymer types as a copolyesters based on terephthalic, isophthalic, sebacic, adipic and hexahydroterephthalic acids b nylons or polyamides c vinylidene chloride copolymers d ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers e cellulosic ethers f synthetic rubbers g cellulose esters h polyvinyl esters including polyvinyl acetate acrylateand polyvinyl acetate methacrylate copolymers i polyacrylate and a alkylpolyacrylate esters, e.g., polymethyl methacrylate, polyethyl methacrylate, and methyl methacrylate ethyl acrylate copolymers j high molecular weight polyethylene oxides of polyglycols having average molecular weights of about 4000 to 1,000,000 k polyvinyl chloride and copolymers 1 polyvinyl acetal m polyurethanes n polycarbonates o polystyrenes and the like. If desired, the photosensitive composition can also contain immiscible polymeric or nonpolymeric organic fillers or reinforcing agents which are essentially transparent at the wavelengths used for the exposure, e.g., the organophilic silicas, bentonites, silica, powdered glass and colloidal carbon, as well as various types of pigments. Such materials are used in amounts varying with the desir ed properties of the photosensitive composition. The fillers are useful in improving the strength of the compositionr reducing tack, and, ifr addition, as coloring agents.Additives which can be employed include dyes, colorants, pigments , dispersing agents, thermographic compounds, and the like. With certain polyenes, it may be desirable to add a plasticizer to give flexibility to the resulting photosensitive layer and facilitate selective development. Suitable plasticizers include dialkyl phthalates, pol yethyIene glycols and related materials such as substituted phenol ethylene oxide adducts, e.g., the polyethers obtained from o , m , and cresol, o , m , and phenylphenol and p nonylphenol, including commercially available materials such as the alkyl phenoxypolyoxethylene ethanols.Other plasticizer include the acetates, propionates, butyrates, caprylates and other carboxylate esters of ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, glycerol, triethylene glycol, pentaerythritol, and other polyhydric alcohols, and alkyl and aryl phosphates such as tributyl phosphate, trihexyl phosphate, trioctyl phosphate, triphenyl phosphate, tricresyl phosphate and cresyl diphenyl phosphate. In order to prevent premature radical reactions prior to use, there can be incorporated in the photosensitive composition a minor amount, for example, about O.001 to 2 percent, based on the total photosensitive composition, of a stabilizer such as hydroquinone, tertiary butyl catechol, 4 methyl 2,6 di t butylphenol, the nitroso dimer inhibitor systems of U.S. Patent 4,168,982, the bis substituted amino sulfides of U.S. Patent 4,168,981, the nitroaromatic photoinhibitors of U.S.Patent 4,198,242, and the like. Such stabilizers improve the storage stability of the photosensitive elements by preventing, thermal oxidation or reaction induced by exposure to adventitious radiation.Photosensitive Element Suitable substrates which, together with the photosensitive composition coated thereon, form the photosensitive elements of this invention include glass, a metal sheet or foil such as copper, aluminum or stainless steel a sheet or film of synthetic organic resin cellulose paper fiberboard or a composite of two or more of these materials. Additional substrates include wood, cloth, silicon wafers, and cellulose esters such as cellulose acetate, cellulose propionate, cellulose butyrate, and the like. Also suitable are films or plates composed of various film forming synthetic resins or high polymers, such as the addition polymers, in particular the vinylidene polymers such as vinyl chloride polymers, vinylidene chloride copolymers with vinyl chloride, vinyl acetate, styrene, isobutylene, and acrylonitrile vinyl chloride copolymers with the latter polymerizable monomers linear condensation polymers including polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalate polyamides such as polyhexamethylene sebacamide polyester amides such as polyhexamethylene adipamide adipate, and the like. Preferred substrates are thin and flexible grained aluminum sheets, steel sheets, copper sheets, silicon wafers, oriented polyethylene terephthalate film, polyvinylidene chloride copolymer coated oriented polyester film, and gelatin coated oriented polyester film. The particular substrate will generally be determined by the use application involved. For example, the photosensitive compositions of this invention are particularly useful for the preparation of photoresists when a copper substrate is used. Fillers or reinforcing agents can be present in the sythetic resin or polymer bases, including synthetic, modified or natural fibers such as cellulosics like cotton, cellulose acetate, viscose rayon and paper. Also useful are glass wool, nylon, and the like. These reinforced bases can be used in laminated form. The photosensitive element can have antihalation material beneath the photosensitive layer. For instance, the substrate can contain an antihalation material or have a layer or stratum of such material on its surface. The antihalation layer intermediate between the photosensitive layer and the substrate when used must have adequate adhesion to the substrate and the photosensitive layer and not react with the radiation adsorptive material.Antihalation pigments include carbon black, manganese dioxide, Acid Blue Black and Acid Magenta O. Resin carriers for the antihalation materials can be polymers of vinyl compounds including copolymers of acrylic and methacrylic acid, polyvinyl chloride polymers and copolymers with vinyl acetate, diethyl fumarate, ethyl acrylate and the like. The photosensitive compositions of this invention provide photosensitive elements which have a high resistance to oxygen inhibition of the photo reaction. As a result of this phenomenon in combination with the high photospeed, satisfactory images can often be obtained by exposure of the element to radiation in the presence of air. Nevertheless, it is sometimes desirable to carry out imaging in vacuum or to use a topcoat or protective stratum for the element Such topcoats should be transparent to actinic radiation, substantially impermeable to oxygen and preferably permeable to water. Suitable coatings include, for instance, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl acetate, gelatin, gum arabic, methyl vinyl ether maleic anhydride copolymer, ethylene oxide polymer, and polyvinyl pyrrolidone, as more particularly described in one or more of U.S. Patent 3,458,311 and British Patents 1,148,362 and 1,303,578. The photosensitive composition is usually applied to the substrate as a solution or dispersion in a carrier solvent. The solution or dispersion can be sprayed, brushed, applied by a roller or an immersion coater, flowed over the surface, picked up by immersion or applied to the substrate by other suitable means. The solvent is then allowed to evaporate. In general, solvents are employed which are volatile at ordinary pressures.Suitable solvents include amides such as N,N dimethylformamide and N,N dimethylacetamide alcohols and ether alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, l propanol, 2 propanol, butanol, ethylene glycol, 1,2 dimethoxyethane, 2 butoxyethanol, and 2 ethoxyethanol esters such as methyl acetate and ethyl acetate aromatic hydrocarbons and aromatic halocarbons such as benzene, o dichlorobenzene and toluene ketones such as acetone, 2 butanone, and 3 pentanone aliphatic halocarbons such as l,l,l trichloroethane, methylene chloride, chloroform, 1,1, 2 tr ichloroethane, l,l,2,2 tetrachloroethane, l,l,2 trichloroethylene miscellaneous solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide, pyridine, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dicyanocyclobutane, N methylpyrrolidone and mixtures of these solvents in various proportions as required to attain solutions. Photoimaging Process The photosensitve compositions and elements of this invention are exposed imagewise to actinic radiation. Exposure is preferably through an image bearing transparency. Suitable sources of radiation include ordinary sunlight and artificial sources such as sunlamps, pulsed and continuous xenon flash lamps, tungsten halogen lamps, germicidal lamps, ultraviolet lamps providing specifically radiation of short wavelength 2537 A , and lamps providing radiation of longer wavelengths, narrow or O O O broad band, centered near 3600 A, 4200 A, 4500 A, or 5000 , such as fluorescent lamps, mercury, metal additive, and arc lamps. Argon glow lamps, photographic flood lamps, lasers and fluorescent radiation sources such as the tracings on the face of a cathode ray tube may also be used.Electron accelerators and electron beam sources through an appropriate mask are also suitable. Of these, the mercury vapor lamps, particularly the sun lamp or black light type, the fluorescent sun lamps, the xenon flash lamps, and the tungsten halogen lamps are the most preferred. The radiation exposure times can vary from fractions of a second to minutes depending upon the intensity and spectral energy distribution of the radiation used, its distance from the photosensitive layer, and the nature and amounts of the photosensitive components in the layer. Customarily, a distance of about 1.5 to 60 inches 3.8 to 153 cm from the photopolymerizable layer is used. Exposure temperatures are not particularly critical, but it is preferred to operateat about ambient temperatures or slightly higher, i.e., about 200 to 500C. Imagewise exposure is conveniently carried out by exposing the photopolymerizable element to actinic radiation through a process transparency, that is, an image bearing transparency consisting of areas substantially opaque and substantially transparent to the radiation being used, where the opaque areas can be substantially of the same optical density for example, a so called line or halftone negative or positive. Suitable process transparencies also include those with a graded range of opaque areas for example, a continuous tone negative. Process transparencies can be constructed of any suitable materials including cellulose acetate film and polyester film. After exposure, the image is developed.Development can be by toning, i.e., dusting with a fine pigment which selectively adheres to the tacky areas, by dye imbibition or by modulation of diffusion. Generally, however, the portions of the layer corresponding to the exposed portions are removed, e.g., in photoresist applications. This latter method of development can be achieved by pressure transfer, differential adhesion of the exposed versus unexposed areas, use of peel apart transfer, and, preferably, by solvent washout. The solvent liquid used for development should have good solvent action in the exposed acidic portion of the composition, and little action in the unexposed area in the time required to remove the exposed portion. It is preferred to employ as development solvents an aqueous base or an aqueous base to which a water soluble organic solvent is added. Suitable solvent mixtures include sodium hydroxide isopropyl alcohol water, sodium carbonate water, sodium carbQnate 2 btbxyethanol water, sodium borate 2 buto xyethanol water, sodium silicate 2 butoxyethanol glycerol water, and sodium carbonate 2 2 butoxyethoxy ethanol water. The particular solvent combination chosen will depend upon the physical properties and carboxyl content of the exposed polyene. Solvent development can be carried out at about 2506r but best results are obtained when the solvent is at 300 to 600C. Development time can be varied and usually is about 0.5 to 15 minutes. In the development step where the image is formed, the solvent can be applied in any convenient manner, as by pouring, immersion, spraying, or roller application. Spraying is preferred since it aids in the removal of the exposed portions of the composition Exposure of a photosensitive composition of the invention to actinic radiation causes addition of the mercapto group of the mercapto acid to reactive unsaturated carbon to carbon groups of the polyene in the exposed area to give a modified polymer which contains acid groups.Development, for example by solvent washout with aqueous alkali, provides for ready dissolution of the acid containing polymer to give directly a positive image where the solubilized area corresponds to the exposed area. The photosensitive elements of the invention show good photochemical efficiency good imaging speed . There are a number of often interrelated factors which affect the performance of photosensitive compositions and elements of the invention. Among the more important of them are choice of polyene, mercapto acid and initiator, molecular weight of the polyene, relative concentrations of polyene mercapto acid initiator, development conditions, and choice of additives including plasticizers and the like. When the goal is to optimize performance, choice of a particular polyene may require care in selecting its molecular weight, and or the mercapto acid to be employed. It was found, for instance, that polyenes based on copolymers of ethylene at certain molecular weights produced compositions which were not successfully developed. One way to overcome this deficiency is to employ such polyenes in the relatively low molecular weight range of about 1,000 to 5,000.In any event, one skilled in the art will encounter little difficulty in fabricating useful and efficient photosensitive compositions and elements of the invention based on the disclosure provided herein. EXAMPLES The following are illustrative of the invention in which all parts and percentages are by weight and all degrees are Celsius unless otherwise stated. Many of the unsaturated N alkenylmaleimide polymers employed in the Examples were prepared by reaction of a designated alkenylamine with the appropriate polymer containing anhydride groups byProcedure A.

Preparation and Use of Photosensitive Composition A coating solution of the photosensitive composition was prepared as follows 1.00 g of N allylmaleimide copolymer, 0.19 g of Il mercaptoundecanoic acid, 0.15 g of benzil dimethyl ketal, 0.04 g of ethylene glycol dicaprylate plasticizer, 0.004 g of 2,6 di tert butyl 4 methylphenol inhibitor, 0.004 g of benzotriazole, 0.004 g of C. I. Solvent Red Dye 109, 4.18 g of 90 10 methylene chloridejmethanol solvent. The resulting clear solution was coated onto a 25 vm oriented polyester film substrate with an 8 mil 200 vm doctor knife. The coated film was dried in an air oven at 550 for 30 min to give a coating of approximately 38 pm in thickness. The coated film was then laminated to a freshly pumiced, blank copper laminate board by passing the film and board through a mechanically driven roll laminator at 120 2.5 f.p.m. A sample of the coated board was exposed through a step wedge process transparency in a vacuum printing frame to radiation from a metal halide lamp covering the 36002 to 4508A spectral range at a distance of 38 cm for a time which corresponds to a radiation dosage of 22 units and an integrated light intensity of 190 mj cm2 incident on the exposed surface of the transparency. The polyester coversheet was removed, and the exposed panel was spray developed at 35o 45 psi 310 kPa with a solution prepared from 2700 mL of water, 300 g of 2 2 butoxyethoxy ethanol and 24 g of sodium carbonate. They board was located at a distance of 27 cm from the spray nozzle during development.After 1 minute, development of the exposed portion of the panel to step 7 30 mj cm2 was complete down to the copper surface. A second sample of the coated board was exposed as described and developed for 2 minutes by the same procedure. The panel was dried for 5 min at 550, and the exposed copper was etched from the fiber glass backing in a cupric chloride bath at 600 for 5 min. The etched plate was then reexposed through a process transparency to an additional 22 units of radiation and the exposed plate was again developed for 2 min. Development of the second exposed area was complete down to the surface. This experiment demonstrates that the photosensitive coating has add on capability since the unexposed composition is still functional after development and etching steps. The exposed image exhibited excellent adhesion and etch resistance. EXAMPLE 2 This Example illustrates development with an all aqueous developer solution. A 25 percent solids coating solution of the photosensitive composition was prepared as follows 1.00 g of the N allylmaleimide copolymer of Example 1, 0.30 g of 11 mercaptoundecanoic acid, 0.1Q g of benzil dimethyl ketal, 0.12 g of ethylene glycol dicaprylate, 0.004 g of 2,6 di tert butyl 4 methylphenol, 0.004 g of benzotriazole, 0.004 g of C.I. Solvent Red Dye 109, 4.60 g of 90 10 methylene chloride methanol solvent.The composition was coated, dried, laminated onto a copper board, and exposed as described in Example 1.The board was spray developed at 500 310 kPa with a solution prepared from 3000 mL of water and 30 g of sodium carbonate. After 3 min, development of the exposed portion of the panel to step 4 87 mj cmê was complete down to the copper surface. Development at 350310 kPa with the solution employed in Example 2 1 gave development to step 13 11 mj cm after 1 min, but some attack of the unexposed areas by the solvent was noted. EXAMPLE 3 A coating solution of the photosensitive composition was prepared as follows 1.00 g of the N allylmaleimide copolymer of Example 1, 0.30 g of mercaptosuccinic acid, 0.10 g of benzil dimethyl ketal, 0.08 g of ParaplexS G 30 plasticizer, 0.004 g of 2,6 di tert butyl 4 methylphenol, 0.004 g of benzotriazole, 0.004 g of C. I. Solvent Red Dye 109, 4.48 g of 90 10 methylene chloride methanol solvent.The composition was coated, dried, laminated, exposed and developed as described in Example 1. After 4 min, development of the exposed portion of the panel to step 3 120 mj cmê was complete down to the copper surface. A second sample of the coated board was exposed, developed, etched, and reexposed through a process transparen cy to an additional 22 units of radiation. The exposed board was developed for 2 min as described in Example 1, and development of the second exposed area was complete down to the surface. The coating exhibited ragged edges after etching and was thus less resistant to the etchant than the coating of Example 1. EXAMPLE 4 A 25 percent solids coating solution of the photosensitive composition was prepared as described in Example 2 except that 0.10 g of ethylene glycol dicaprylate, 0.12 g of benzotriazole and 0.012 g of 2,6 di tert butyl 4 methylphenol were used in the formulation. The composition was coated, dried, laminated, and exposed as described in Example 1.The board was spray developed at 400 310 kPa with a solution prepared by mixing 120 mL of 2 2 butoxyethoxy ethanol and 2880 mL of a solution prepared from 30 g of sodium carbonate and 2970 mL of water. After 1 min, development of the exposed portion of the panel to step 4 87 mj cm2 was complete down to the copper surface. The coating showed good add on capability when tested for second imaging as described in Example 1. EXAMPLE 5 An aluminum substrate was employed as follows. A 25 percent solids coating solution of the photosensitive compositon was prepared as described in Example 2 except that 0.10 g of ethylene glycol dicaprylate was used in the formulation. The composition was coated, dried, and laminated onto a pumiced aluminum sheet. Exposure and spray development at 400 310 kPa was carried out as described in Example 4. After 1 min, development of the exposed portion of the panel to step 6 42 mi cmê was complete down to the aluminum surface. EXAMPLE 6 A coating solution of the photosensitive composition was prepared as follows 1.00 g of the N allylmaleimide copolymer of Example 1, 0.20 g of ll mercaptoundecanoic acid, 0.10 g of mercaptosuccinic acid, 0.10 g of ethylene glycol dicaprylate, 0.004 g of 2,6 di tert butyl 4 methylphenol, 0.004 g of benzotriazole, 0.004 g of C. I. Solvent Red Dye 109, 4.54 g of 90 10 methylene chloride methanol solvent.The composition was coated, dried, laminated, exposed and developed as described in Example 4. After 2 min, development of the exposed portion of the panel to step 5 57 mj cm2 was complete down to the copper surface The coating showed fair add on capability when tested for second imaging as described in Example 1. EXAMPLE 7 A 25 percent solids coating solution of the photosensitive composition was prepared as described in Example 2 except that 0.15 g of benzil dimethyl ketal and 0.10 g of ethylene glycol dicaprylate were used in the formulation. The composition was coated, dried, laminated, exposed and developed as described in Example 4. After 1 min, development of the exposed portion of the panel to step 4 87 mj cm 2 was complete down to the copper surface. A second, unexposed panel was spray developed at 400 310 kPa for z min with the developer solution, dipped into a cupric chloride etching bath at 60 for 3 min, and then exposed through a step wedge as described in Example 4. An oriented polyester film coversheet was inserted between the coating and the step wedge during exposure. The panel was then spray developed to determine the photospeed of the composition. After 1 min, development of the exposed portion of the panel to step 5 57 mj cm2 was complete down to the copper surface. This demonstrates that the add on photospeed of the composition is substantially unchanged by the processing steps employed to make the first print and etch image. A third panel was exposed to 10 units 87 2 mj cm of radiation through a resolution target and developed as described. Resolution of 2 mil 51 pm lines and spaces was achieved. The exposed copper was subsequently etched from the panel in a cupric chloride bath at 600 without undercutting or loss of adhesion of the coating.
