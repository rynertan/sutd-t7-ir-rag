## Description
STRUCTURE OF A JUNCTION FOR CONNECTING ELECTRIC COMPONENTS TO ELECTRIC CARDS RACEWAYS This invention relates to a structure of a junction for connecting electric components to electric cable raceways. As is known, in the making of electric systems for both domestic and industrial applications, it is current practice to use raceways or channels having a substantially Ut shaped cross sectional conSigura tion and through which the various electric supply cables are passed along with any other accessory facilities such as telephone, electronic processor, and the like lines. Such raceways are covered with a top moulding, and at the locations of the various electric compow nents, such as sockets, switches, pushbuttons, etc.,Junctions must be provided for connection to the electric cablas rimning inside the raceway. In known embodiments, that Junction has been formed integrally with the box type body containing the electric component, and resultantly the system s versatility is poor. Another drawback attributable to prior solutions is that it becomes accordingly necessary to provide a comprehensive type range of box type bodies to which the junction is connected rigidly, thereby one must have a large number of box type bodies available for making the connection. It is the aim of this invention to eliminate such prior drawbacks by providing a standardised junction structure which can be readily applied to any box type body containing the different electric components, thus affording the advantage of using a single junction for all the box type bodies. Within the above aim, it is a particular obJect of this invention to provide a Junction structure which is quick and simpler to attach to the raceway and readily connectable in a stable and safe manner to the various box type bodies. Another object of this invention is to provide a Junction structure for connecting electric components to electric cable raceways which, by virtue of its peculiar constructional features, can give fufl assurance of being reliable and safe to use. A not least object of this invention is to provide a suction structure which can be easily obtained from commercially readily available materials, and be competitive from a purely economical standpoint. The above aim, and these and other obJects to become apparent hereinafter, are achieved by a structure of a Junction for connecting electric components to electric cable raceways, according to the invention characterized in that it comprises a body having a cutout adapted to be set astride an electric cable raceway, said body having, externally of the area affected by said raceway, a head defining internally a communication channel to said raceway and externally, a groove for removable coupling with a window which may be formed in the side surface of the box type case enclosing an electric component. Further features and advantages will become apparent from the following detailed description of a junction structure for connecting electric components to electric cable raceways, according to the invention, as shown by way of illustration and not of limitation in the accompanying drawing, wherein Figure 1 is a perspective view showing diagrammatically a Junction as applied to a raceway with its respective box type body Figure 2 is an exploded perspective view of theJunction and one possible conformation of the boxtype body Figure 3 shows in section the Junction and boxtype body prior to their coupling and Figure 4 shows in section the Junction and boxtype body as coupled together. With reference to the cited drawing figures, the structure of a junction for connecting electric components to electric cable raceways or trunking, which is generally designated with the reference numeral 1, has a body 2, which has in its rearward portion a cutout 3 adapted to be superitaposed on and settable astride a raceway, generally designated 4 in the accompanying drawing. The body 2 has on its inward face a tooth or dog 5 for hooking on the raceway. The peculiarity of the invention is that theJunction 1 has, in the area unaffected by said raceWay, a head 10 which defines on its interior a through going channel 11 affording commu.nication with the interior of the raceway on which the Junction 1 is superimposed and laid substantially transversely. In its outward portion, the head 10 has a groove 20 which is upwardly delimited by a flange formation 22 of the head itself and downwardly by a step like detent 23. Advantageously, the flange 22 and detent 23 are set slightly outwardly divergent from each other to form a tightening zone, as explained herein below. The groove 20 is engageable in a window 30 which may be formed in the side wall of a box type body 31 enclosing the electric component, which may have any suitable shape. Advantageously, to make the system more versatile, the window may be formed in the side wall at pre selectable locations, because there are provided, on the side wall of the box type body 31, weakening lines which facilitate removal of the wall portion which defines the window. Once the window 30 is made, it practically interlocks with the area defined by the groove, thus providing a very stable and reliable tightening, which is facilitated by that, as mentioned above, the flange 22 and detent 23 are slightly convergent toward each other and inwardly, thereby further enhancing the tightening action. With the arrangement Just described, one can have a single junction available which is quickly and removably attachable to any box type body, making the whole system extremely practical and versatile0 It may be appreciated from the foregoing description that the invention achieves the objects set forth, and in particular that the Junction disclosed has the peculiar feature of being an independent en tity of the box type body, having the possibility of effecting quick assembly, or if required, disassembly from the box type bodies containing the various electric components which make up the system. In practicing the invention, the materials used, although best results are to be obtained using electrically insulative plastics, and the dimensions and contingent shapes may be any required ones.
