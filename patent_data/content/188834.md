# A ratioless FET programmable logic array.

## Abstract
A ratioless, zero d.c. power dissipating FET programm able logic array including a column boost capacitor for main taining the columns of selected AND array transistors at ap proximately their precharged voltage while their associated OR array transistors are being evaluated.
