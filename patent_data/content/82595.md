# Vibration damper assembly for a clutch.

## Abstract
A vibration damper 10 for a clutch having a built in rotary sensitive and applied force lag control for an automotive vehicle adapted to reduce the tip in and tip out effects on the clutch, such as in an automotive lock up clutch in a torque converter. The vibration damper includes a hub 13 having radially extending fingers 15 , and the lag control comprises friction lag plates 49 received on each finger for generally outward radial movement relative to the hub to frictionally engage in a channel of a vibration damper housing under centrifugal force due to rotation of the assembly. The outward movement of the lag plates may be enhanced by a camming action or resilient means 65 between the hub finger and lag plate.
