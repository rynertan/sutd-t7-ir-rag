# Synthetic resin blends for packaging films and methods of production of such films.

## Abstract
A nylon ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer EVOH blend suitable for extrusion into strong, tough films possessing good oxygen barrier qualities comprises 90 to 20 weight percent of nylon and 10 to 80 weight percent of EVOH the nylon is compounded with a plasticizing agent which typically lowers the normal extrusion temperature of the nylon which is in the region of 266 to 282 C to a temperature of 204 to 249 C at this temperature the blend can be extruded by the method disclosed without significant degradation. The blend exhibits enhanced adhesive qualities, as compared to films of EVOH copolymer per se, and is well adapted for use in multilayer films. A method for fabricating the resin blend into a composite film involves combining the blend with a chosen resin an an extruder and coextruding the blend and this resin. Films made from the nylon EVOH blend are suitable for the packaging of comestibles.
