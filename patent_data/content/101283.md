# Panel for self supporting roof structures comprising elongated extruded profile elements of plastics material closed at their ends, and closure member for such profile elements.

## Abstract
A panel for self supporting roof structures of extruded profile elements having at least one main duct closed at the ends with closing members 10 which are made of plastics material and have the same profile as the profile elements and is closed at one end 17 . The closing member 10 is of so reduced dimensions as to fit into any main duct in the profile element while allowing some air exchange without the risk of penetration of dirt. The closing member 10 has preferably resilient sealing flaps 12, 13, 14, 15 on two opposite sides, so that one and the same member 10 can be used for closing profile elements of varying size and shape, e.g. as a result of manufacturing inaccuracies. A V shaped groove encircles the outer surface of the closing member and permits movement of the two parts of a bipartite flap.
