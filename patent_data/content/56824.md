## Description
THERAPEUTIC AGENT Background of the Invention This invention relates to a composition and method for relieving the symptoms of such auto immune ailments as rheumatoid arthritis. The nature of rheumatoid arthritis is such that one familiar with it would be led to conclude that other auto immune ailments which also involve symptomatic inflammation of tissues will also respond to treatment according to the present invention.Other such auto immune ailments include asthma, multiple sclerosis nerve tissue , lupus erythematosus kidneys , sclerodermata skin , arteritis, and other somewhat rare ailments classified as connective tissue diseases, or immune complex diseases. There are a number of theories for the etilogy of rheumatoid arthritis including the probability that it is an auto immunological ailment which requires the existance of an antibody or RA factor in the blood. Note that RA and RF are used interchangeably herein .The presence of the RA factor antibody is well known and widely used as a confirming.test for arthritis. A rheumatoid arthritis causative agent has not been isolated. Because the present invention works on a second auto immune ailment, and in view of certain results of laboratory tests in vitro with components of the human body complement system and tests on at least one patient, it is believed that similar auto immune ailments will also respond to treatment. The pain and discomfort due to arthritis is a major disabling factor for large numbers of people.Even without actually curing these diseases, a remission of the symptoms would permit may individuals to lead more profitable and more fulfilling lives. Brief Description In brief, this invention is in the use of an active agent found in an extract of materials from the venom sac of ants of the genes Pseudomyrmex species triplarinus. The extract is obtained by crushing the abdomen of the ant. The crushed abdomen are then mixed with an aqueous solvent and the resulting solution filtered, purified, and adjusted to provide a concentration effective for injection into a patient. The extract containing the therapeutic agent is injected subcutaneously into the patient wherein, apparently without significant side effects, it causes remission of arthritic symptoms and appears to significantly decrease the RA factor measure of an antibody normally associated with rheumatoid arthritis . An aqueous saline solution physiological solution is normally employed as the carrier as this has been found to be compatable with the extract as well as the human body. In order to identify the active agent in the extract, the human complement system is used as a test of activity of purified substances. The validity of this method of assaying was confirmed by a number of actual tests on humans and rats. Description of the Preferred Embodiments The ant Pseudomyrmex triplarinus is limited to certain parts of tropical South America. It belongs to a highly specialized group of ants all of which are restricted in their nesting habits to trees of the genusTriplaris which plant group is limited to the American tropics. More specifically the ant employed in the tests is the worker sterile female , genus Pseudomyrmex, species triplarinus sub family Pseudomyrmicinae, and family Formicidae. This sub family has an unusual evolutionary history. There is no agreement on where it should be placed in the evolution of ants. It clearly belongs to the family Formicidae which is the ant family. But it is not clear what its ancestral strain is or how its ancestral strain is related to the ancestral strains of other ants. It is probably fair to say that, within the context of agreeing that these are indeed ants, they appear to be totally unrelated to the rest of the ants.They are unrelated in the sense that some of their habits and in particular their anatomy diverge pronouncedly from the habits and the anatomy of other ants. This is one of the reasons for the conclusion that the venom of the ants of the triplarinus species of ant, is unrelated to the venom of other insects including the venom of any other group of ants.EXTRACTION OF THE ACTIVE AGENTMETHOD I Aqueous Extraction In one method for making a composition for injecting into a patient, the abdomens are separated from the ants. The abdomen contains the venom sac. A fixed number of separated abdomens are then macerated stirred, squeezed and crushed in saline physiological solution to dissolve the soluble parts. The mixture is then filtered1 removing all insoluble constitutents. The result is a solution of portions of the venom and other abdominal juices which are soluble in physiological solution. More specifically, a presently preferred mode of preparing an effective agent involves the following steps 1 the dissected abdomens are macerated in a saline physiological solution, 2 the result is filtered through a No. 1 gauge filter and the filter is worked three times with physiological solution, 3 the result is diluted with saline physiological solution to a concentration equivalent to the venom from ten ants in one cubic centimeter of solution, 4 controls are taken for bacteriological and microscopic analysis, and 5 after sterility is proven the solution is stored at one to two degrees Centigrade. The solution can be held in sterile ampoules for use.USE OF ACTIVE AGENT FOR SYMPTOMATIC RELIEF OF RHEUMATOIDARTHRITIS In a number of early tests, the chrushed and filtered abdomen of one hundred ants extracted according toMethod I and diluted with physiological solution to provide twenty cubic centimeters 20 c.c. of mixture was used. The resulting concentration is the content of five venom sacs in one c. c. In an initial series of tests1 the injections generally started with an amount of solution containing the venom provided by 0.5 ants. Such an amount is called herein 0.5 UF. Doses were given daily to stepthe amount up over a period of about ten days to a level where doses are equal to the venom from approximately five to ten ants.At first 0.1 c. c. was injected in the upper arm in order to determine the patient s sensitivity to the venom and to prevent anaphylactic reaction. If no adverse reaction was observed1 injections then were administered at regular intervals and increasing doses, starting with 0.5 UF.All injections were administered subcutaneously or intradermically. With good tolerance, doses were given daily for about 10 days, increasing the concentration for the last 5 days to 10 UF daily, according to each individual case. The reaction of the skin to these injections is similar to the reaction of the skin toward a sting from the ant except for the important fact that there is no pain. In particular a little white papilla appears around the injection. After a few minutes, a swelling and bright red coloring occurs. In general, these symptoms are slight and disappear within twenty four 24 hours. No infection was associated with these injections. It has been found that a treatment of 10 days with amounts representing the equivalent of 5 to 10 ants venom sacs or abdomen during the last 5 days provides substantial relief or disappearance of arthritic symptoms.In an initial series of tests given in Bolivia, relief in many cases appeared to last over a period of years. Furthermore, in each case, no adverse side effects were observed. TEST RESULTS FOR UTILITY Arthritis was simulated in rats for testing the anti inflamatory properties of the extracted material. In addition, a carefully contructed double blind test was made on humans. Both tests are briefly described. One test was limited to human subjects carefully selected so that all had rheumatoid arthritis according to the American RheumatismAssociation criteria. Accordingly, it is believed that substantial utility for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis has been demonstrated. It is believed that arthritis of other forms are sufficiently divergent in etiology non autoimmune ailments that no easonable prediction can be made as to the utility of this invention for treating gouty and other forms of arthritis. However, tests on laboratory animals indicate that the venom is an anti inflammatory agent.Human Study I Symptomatic Relief Indicia To test the potential efficacy of this venom a double blind clinical trial was undertaken at the Laboratorio Clinico Serrales in Santo Domingo, D. R. This trial was designed by Charles Sisk, M.D., former Director ofMedical and Scientific Affairs of the National ArthriticFoundation, and at the time of the test, Associate Professor of Medicine, University of Missouri Medical Center.The principal co investigator of the study was HarveyBrown, M. D., Professor of Medicine, University of MiamiSchool of Medicine. The trial was conducted during the interval from April 1975 through August 1975. A method I extract of venom was used. Venom was extracted manually from abdominal pouches of the insect, mixed with a physiological saline solution, refrigerated with ice, and shipped to the Dominican Republic from Bolivia.No attempt was made to further purify the extract as temperature stability and other physiochemical characteristics were not well defined. It is believed that early attempts to add preservatives to the venom may have resulted in causing the venom mixture to become inactive.Selection of Subjects 1 Thirty subjects were located who all met theUnited States Food and Drug Administration FDA definition 1970 of having active rheumatoid arthritis. The FDA definition requires having greater than a defined level of at least three out of four RA parameters as defined by theAmerican Rheumatism Association ARA criteria 1958 for rheumatoid arthritis RA . The four parameters are listed below. The technique for measuring these parameters and the criteria for meeting the FDA definition of RA disease as set forth in FDA and ARA standards was followed. Prior to study entry all subjects on anti inflammatory medications were instructed to stop this medication for at least three days before beginning the trial. One criteria established before accepting a subject was that the subject could not be on steroid treatment of over 10 mg. prednison equivalent during the three month interval before study entry. No subject had received gold salt treatment before or during the trial. All subjects were initially randomized to venomtreated and placebo groups in accordance with a doubleblind, parallel design. Ten 10 subjects initially randomized to the placebo treatment were subsequently treated with venom thus permitting a crossover comparison of this group.Procedure I Both venom and placebo were administered by subcutaneous injection of the upper arm or thigh. Venom was given in increasing single daily doses over several days until a maximum 1 milliliter ml dose was achieved according to the following schedule DAY DOSE 1 0.1 ml 2 0.2 ml 3 0.3 ml 4 0.5 ml 5 14 1.0 ml each dayAll injections were administered by laboratory personnel not involved in the evaluation of therapeutic response. Subjects were required to come to the Clinic each day for their injections. Compliance was excellent and no subject deviated from the treatment schedule. To simulate both the local and systemic effects of the venom, histamine phosphate 0.1 mg. base equivalent was given to the placebo group. Although this preparation did not satisfactorily simulate venom effects, precautions were taken to maintain double blindness by covering injection sites during evaluation and by not advising subjects of the types of side effects they might experience from venom or placebo. All pre treatment evaluations were performed by one of the co investigators with three exceptions. The three exceptions were examined by a third rheumatologist trained in the United States. All follow up evaluations were done by one of the co investigators. If patients needed supplementary medication dur ing the . study they were given propoxphene and in structed to take it on an as needed basis.. They were advised to avoid all other anti rheumatic medication including aspirin and any other aspirin containing medication. The four parameters used to determine the existence of active RA were also used to evaluate. a. number of clinically active joints b. erythrocyte sedimentation rate ESR , as measured by the Westergren method c. duration of morning stiffness and d. grip strength.Each of the above four parameters is measured as set forth in the ARA Cooperating Clinics Committee Observer s Guide 1958 . The age range of the 16 cases receiving venom was 35 to 71 years with a mean of 58 years and of the 14 cases in the placebo group 34 to 74 years with a mean of 54 years.In the venom treated group there were 14 females and 2 males, in the placebo group, 7 females and 7 males. Functional classification of these therapeutic groups is shown inTable I. Infra page 11 .Results Procedure I All rheumatological evaluations were done within the week prior to study entry Pre Rx , at the termination of the two week treatment interval Post Rx I and at an interval thereafter Post Rx II which was four weeks after Post Rx I in the case of some subjects and six weeks in the case of other subjects. The Post Rx II data, whether taken at four or six weeks after treatment, is combined in the following analysis. The data is summarized in TableII for the parallel venom and placebo groups. Table III is extracted from Table II and provides a summary of the significantly improved parameters. The data indicates that statistically significant improvements occur in grip strength and in the number of clinically active joints in the venom treated group while corresponding improvement does not occur within the placebo treated group. No adverse reactions other than local ones were observed in subjects receiving venom. All subjects received a battery of laboratory tests including tests for toxicity.These included, pre and post treatment CBC, urinalysis, clinical chemistries SMA 12 . None of these parameters suggested any hematologic, renal, hepatic or other toxicity.Local reactions consisted of marked induration, heat and erythema at the points of injection. Most of these reactions subsided spontaneously in one or two weeks after discontinuing treatment. One subject developed a localized abscess. This responded promptly to antibiotic therapy. To confirm that the therapeutic agent of this invention did not obtain its therapeutic properties by acting as a stress agent and stimulating endogenous cortisol product, pre and post treatment serum cortisol levels were measured in all cases. No differences of before and after therapy hormone level were observed. This result indicates that the dangerous condition known as adrenal crisis, which is caused by repeated stimulation of the adrenal glands, is not likely to occur as a result of extended treatment according to the present invention. The mean values of the various rheumatological parameters measured during the trail are set forth in Table II. The statistically significant mean values together with their standard deviations are set forth in Table III. It might be noted that the improvement obtained was not obtained immediately at the termination of the injections or, at least, the improvement obtained by that time was not statistically significant. The statistically significant improvement was observed at the end of a four or six week period Post Rx II after termination of the injections. Apparently, it takes time for the inflammation to subside and for the body to adjust to the change.It is not yet known for how long the treatment is effective or, more specifically, what the relationship is between time after treatment and level of return of symptoms to pretreatment levels. The extent of improvement in the number of clinically active joints is a measure of the number of joints which at Pre Rx were degrees 2, 3 or 4 on the ARA definition of degree of involvement of clinically active joints and which became grades zero or one at Post Rx II. Thus the improvement had to pass over the threshold between degrees 2 and degree 1 in order for it to be recorded as an improvement in the data set forth in the tables. A joint which improved from a fourth degree level severe to the second degree level minimal definitely present, but mild under the ARA definitions would not be reflected as an improvement in the data in the tables.It is believed that the extent of the improvement obtained by this treatment and its statistical significance would be increased if the analysis took into account all improvement and not just the improvement that passed the threshold between degrees two and one. With respect to Table II, it should be noted that the footnoted P levels were made with the appropriate parametric t tests for grip strength and for number of clinically active joints. Ten of the fourteen individuals in the placebo group were given the venom treatment after termination of the parallel venom and placebo trial. The individuals selected were not selected at random but were those who tended to have the worst symptoms. Thus the results of this crossover trial group cannot be rigorously statistically analyzed. Nonetheless, there was a reduction of number of clinically active joints in the groups of ten subjects from a Pre Rx mean of 23.9 std. dev. 12.9 to a post treatment mean of 13.0 std. dev. 11.9 . This suggests a statistically significant difference at the P .05 level.The other rheumatological parameters of this cross over group did not show a statistically significant degree of improvement.

Utility As An Anti Inflammatory Agent For SimulatedRheumatoid Arthritis In Rats Tests were made utilizing rats to show the general anti inflammatory properties of the subject invention extract and methods for further purifying or using said extract to enhance its effectiveness. Rheumatoid arthritis was simulated in Sprague Dolly rats by injecting an adjuvant, Parrigan C, into the right foot pad of the rat. Measurements were made along the dorsal ventral axis in millimeters. The untreated left foot was also measured as a standard. These tests are generally considered to simulate rheumatoid arthritis closely enough for the test results to be an indication of the effectiveness of the material being used for use in human beings. However, the tests in fact generally indicate the anti inflammatory properties of the material being tested. The results of the tests show that the subject invention extract not only reduces rheumatoid arthritis symptoms but also reduces the measured RA factor in the blood, and apparently accomplishes these results without increasing the cortisol serum levels in the blood.Purification of Polysaccharide for Clinical Studies Method I A Starting with X ml of extract Method I above usually 47 ml, 0.275 mg protein ml 9 parts of absolute ethanol are slowly added to 1 part of the extract with constant stirring at OOC, the mixture is stirred for 1 hr.at 0 C, and centrifuged Sorval RC2 B, 12,000 x g, 30 min, 40C The supernatant fluid is discarded, and the precipitate is washed one time with 90 per cent ethanol at OOC and centrifuged. A small volume of distilled water is added to suspend the material, and it is lyophilized to eliminate the alcohol. Distilled water is added to dissolve the dry powder, it is centrifuged to eliminate insoluble material, and the supernatant fluid is dialyzed vs. 0.018 M sodium phosphate containing 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.2 PBS .This preparation, which is mostly polysaccharide but contains at least one protein as shown by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, may be stored in the lyophilized state, and is reconstituted by adding the desired volume of distilled water. Other methods for further purification such as a Concanavalin A linked Sepharose Chromatography and b ultrafiltration membrane have been successfully used but were not used in the preparation of the material used for this study. This analysis is of a polysaccharide which appears to be the most important, if not the only active factor in the therapeutic agent of the present invention. The PS had a heterogenous size in native ant venom. The smallest moiety that activated serum C1 had aMW of ca. 3,000 daltons as determined by gel chromatography.The PS was not precipitated by barium salts, showing no apparent sulfate groups. The following sugars and the molar ratios were found by gas chromatography mannose 7.7 , fucose 1.8 , N acetylgalactosamine 1.6 , galactose 1.4 , glucose 1.0 , and N acetylglucosamine 1.0 . Identification Of The Active Factor The active factor of the present invention was isolated and the isolated material characterized by electrophoresis separation of components followed by reactions with various known reagents elemental analysis IR spectrometry and solubility all as set forth below The Drawings Fig 1 is a flow diagram for the purification ofPolysaccharide from native ant venom extracted by Method I . Fig. 2. Analysis of the products of the isolation steps for the ant venom polysaccharide, by disc electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels. The gels are 1 native ant venom 0.275 mg protein ml, 180 ng ml of uronic acid , 2 the alcohol precipitate lyophilized and solubilized in distilled water, 18 pg ml of uronic acid , and 3 the product that eluted from the Sepharose Con A 10.5 pg ml of uronic acid , all stained for proteins with Amido Black 10B. Gel nos. 4, 5, and 6 are the same products as 1, 2, and 3, but stained with periodic acid Schiff reagent. The arrows point to the polysaccharide s which caused C1 activation and C4 and C2 consumption in serum. Fig. 3 A . Elution profile of native ant venom 13.8 mg protein ml on Sephadex G 25 at 4 C.

The arrows point to PAS positive bands1 and demonstrate the heterogeneity of the polysaccharide. Fig. 5 is a typical IR Spectra run neat on an alcohol precipate of ant venom extract. Fig. 6 is a typical IR Spectra run neat on an aD mannoside eluate of Con A column of the alcohol precipitate.Isolation of the polysaccharide PS Nine parts of absolute ethanol were slowly added to 1 part of the venom 47 ml of venom, 0.275 mg protein ml, 180 pg ml of uronic acid with constant stirring at OOC. A light precipitate formed, the mixture was stirred for l hr at OOC, and centrifuged Sorvall RC2 B 12,000 x g 30 min 4 C . The supernatant fluid was discarded because after evaporation of the alcohol and solubilization in an aqueous buffer, the product did not cause C4 consumption in normal human serum. The precipitate was washed one time with 90 per cent ethanol at O C and centrifuged. A small volume of distilled water was added to suspend the material, and it was lyophilized to eliminate the alcohol.Forty seven milliliters of distilled water were added to dissolve the dry powder, it was centrifuged to eliminate insoluble material, and the supernatant fluid was dialyzed against 18 nM sodium phosphate containing 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.2 PBS . Forty six milliliters 18 pg ml of uronic acid were applied to a 2.4 x 22 cm column containing Sepharose Con A that was equilibrated with PBS at 25 0C. The column was first washed withPBS, and the latter 3C0 ml was concentrated to 46 ml 7 pg ml of uronic acid with an Amicon UM 2 membrane Amicon Corp., Lexington, Mass. . Then the column was thoroughly washed with 300 ml of 300 nM sodium borate buff The polysaccharide causes the activation of the first compoment of complement C1 in normal human serum, which in turn acts on its two natural substrates C4 and C2. Thus, C4 and orC2 consumption indirectly shows that C1 was activated. er, pH 8.7 no uronic acid recovered , and eluted with 300 ml of 100mM methyl D mannoside in PBS. This was concentrated to 46 ml with an Amicon UM 2 membrane, and contained 10.5 pg ml of uronic acid. All the above pools were concentrated with an Amicon UM 2 membrane to 10 ml at 4 0C. Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis The method for polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using no stacking gel and 7 per cent separating gel Orstein, 1964 Davis, 1964 is described in the manual of CanalcoCo. Rockville, MD . Gels were stained for protein withAmido Black 10B Greenfield et al, 1971 , and for glycoprotein and polysaccharida with periodic acid Schiff reagent Segrest Jackson, 1972 . Neutral sugars were detected with anthrone reagent Seifter et al, 1950 , hexuronic acids by the carbazole method of Bitter and Muir 1962 , and phosphate by the method of Ames and Dubin 1960 . Gas chromatography. To anthrone and uronic acid positive samples was added a fine concentration of 3N HCl, and they were hydrolyzed at 100 C for 3 hr. The hydrolysate were reduced by sodium borohydride, acetylated with acetic annydride by standard procedures Griggs et al, 1971 , and the alditol acetates were analyzed by gas chromatography with a Hewlett Packard apparatus. The products of the purification steps were sub jetted to electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels, applying 250 pl gel. In Fig. 2, gel columns no. 1, 2, and 3 are, respectively native ant venom, the alcohol precipitate that was lyophilized and solubilized in distilled water, and the product that eluted from the Con A column. They were stained with Amido Black 10B. Gel columns no. 4, 5, and 6 are the same as 1, 2, and 3, but they were stained with periodic acid Schiff reagent PAS . Most of the venom protein was eliminated by the alcohol precipitation step gel no. 2 .The product that eluted from the Con A column had no detectable protein gel. no. 3 , but contained material that did not enter the gel, and at least 2 diffuse bands which stained with the PAS gel no. 6 , indicating a polysaccharide s . Serial slices of varying thickness from top to bottom Table 1 of 6 unstained gels containing the Con A eluate were podled, eluted 48 hr with 2 ml of DGVB at 40C, and concentrated to 0.5 ml with an Amicon UM 2 membrane at 4 0C. Equal volumes of each concentrated eluate and normal human serum were incubated at 370C for 4 hr, and the C4 levels were determined by functional hemolytic assays.Table 1 shows that the product that consumed serum C4 i.e., activated C1 was in the top 1 to 3 mm, including a portion that did not enter the gel, and also the activity was associated with a second PAS positive band that entered the gel.Some activity was found between the two major PAS positive bands which entered the gel, probably indicating that variable quantities of the polysaccharide s did not migrate as a homogeneous band.Fractionation and characterization of the polysaccharide in native ant venom. One hundred milliliters of venom were concentrated to 2 ml by ultrafiltration with an Amicon UM 2 membrane 13.8 mg protein ml at 40C and applied to a 1.1 x 70 cm column containing Sephadex G 25 equilibrated with 5 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5, at 40C. Individual fractions were assayed for protein by measuring absorbance at 280 nm, for sugars with anthrone reagent, and for the capability to cause consumption of serum C4 by functional hemolytic assays. For the latter, equal volumes of normal human serum and the column fraction were incubated for 4 hr at 370C, and the titer of C4 was determined. The results in Fig 3 A show that 3 anthrone positive peaks eluted, but only peaks I PS I and II PS II were analyzed further because peak III did not cause C4 consumption. The anthrone positive peaks PS I and PS II were pooled separately, concentrated by ultrafiltration AmiconUM 2 membrane at 40C, and reapplied to the same column.Both peaks eluted in the same position as before. Thus, peak PS II was significantly lighter than PS I Fig 3B .The molecular weight was estimated to be 3000 daltons by the method of Andrews 1964 . The individual fractions within the peaks were pooled, concentrated, and applied to polyacrylamide gels. Figure 4 gel no. 1 shows that concentrated PS I was heterogeneous, and individual bands were not distinguishable after staining the gel with PAS. Gels no. 2, 3, and 4 are concentrated PS I diluted in saline 1 10, 1 20, and 1 40, respectively. Much of PS I did not enter the gel or remained in the top portions, and in addition, a diffuse more anodal band is shown in gels no. 1, 2, and 3 arrows . PS II gel no. 5 also was heterogeneous in the gel. A portion of the PS remained on the top of the gel, and 2 bands arrows were distinguishable within the gel.Sugar composition of the venom PS. The concentrated fractions within peak PS I Fig. 3A were analyzed for individual sugars by gas chromatography, and compared with the ethanol precipitate of the venom. Table 2 shows that 6 sugars were identified mannose,N acetylglucosamine, galactose, fucose, N acetyl galactosamine, and glucose. Mannose was present in the highest concentration, and glucose the least in concentration. The alcohol precipitate of the venom, which had all of the polysaccharide and only a small portion of the total protein, also contained the same sugars by gas chromatographic analysis, and approximately the same molar ratios as PS I. Since the protein s that remained after alcohol precipitation of the venom was anodal migrating in polyacrylamide and did not stain with PAS Fig. 2, gels no.2 and no. 5 , it is probable that the sugars that were measured by gas chromatography were from the PS and not from a glycoprotein s . In addition to the neutral sugars, a high content of hexuronic acid also was present in both PS I and the alcohol precipitate, which explains the source of the net negative charge of the polysaccharide. In other preliminary chemical assays with PS I and the alcohol precipitate, they were not precipitated by barium salts, showing no apparent sulfate groups, and they were negative for phosphate content Ames Dubin, 1960 . IR SPECTRA An IR spectrograph was run on neat purified material. As would be expected, only three major peak were obtained. These are tabulated in Table 3. ELEMENTAL ANALYSIS CHO The purified material eluted from the Sepharose Con A column and the alcohol precipitate before purification in the Sepharose Con A column from three separate lots of venom extract were sent to Galbraith Laboratories,Inc., Knoxville, Tenn, for elemental analysis. The results are tabulated in Table 4. SOLUBILITY To 3 ml of native ant venom Lot 080678 WA was added 27 ml of ice cold absolute ethyl alcbhol with stirring at OOC to precipitate the active polysaccharide. A light precipitate formed, and the material was centrifuged in 6 tubes containing 5 ml each International PR 2, 2000 RPM, 10 min, Ooh . The ethanol was decanted, the six precipitates were dispersed at the bottom of each tube, and 5 ml of the following solvents were added acetone, benzene, chloroform, anhydrous ethyl ether, propylene glycol, or glycerol. After mixing, the solubility of the precipitates was determined by visual inspection, at 250C. The results tabulated in Table 5 wherein insoluble means at least substantially insoluble most of the material was apparently not dissolved. Soluble means most of the material appeared to be in solution. Table 1. Consumption of C4 in normal human serum by eluates of polyacrylamide gel slices containing the isolated polysaccharide from ant venom see Fig. 2 . Equal volumes of each eluate and the serum were incubated at 370C for 4 hr, and the C4 titer was determined by functional hemolytic assays.
