# Circuit breaker with an improved internal gas expansion and venting system.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a molded case circuit breaker with an improved internal arc gas expansion and venting system. Next to the arcing region at one end of the arc chute 54 where electrical arcs are initiated upon contact separation, there is provided a gas expansion chamber 408 which is open toward the arc chute. A stationary contact structure 426, 428, 430 436 is disposed in the expansion chamber and has a configuration enabling arc gas to expand directly into the expansion chamber, and causing air forced from the expansion chamber by the expanding arc gas to be directed into the arc chute. At its opposite end, the arc chute communicates with vent means 420 in a wall portion of the circuit breaker housing through an additional gas expansion chamber 406 .
