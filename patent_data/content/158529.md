# PRESSURE FILTER

## Abstract
A pressure filter for separating a liquor from mud liquor slurry and for concentrating a filter cake as a heavy slurry discharge, comprising a tank 11 having a ring of filter elements 15 supported by a plate 16 which separates the filter tank from a filtrate chamber 20. The feed enters the tank under pressure through an enlarged feed cylinder tube 29 located in the centre of the ring of filter elements. In the backwashing mode of operation the feed rate is maintained or increased to assist in displacing filter cake from the filter element.
