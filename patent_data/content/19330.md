# Olefin polymerization catalyst compositions and a process for the polymerization of olefins employing such compositions.

## Abstract
An olefin polymerization catalyst composition comprising a a reaction product of an organo aluminium compound and an electron donor, and b a solid component which has been obtained by halogenating a magnesium compound with the formula MgR₁R₂ wherein R₁ is an alkyl, aryl, alkoxide or aryloxide group and R₂ is an alkyl, aryl, alkoxide or aryloxide group or halogen, with a halide of tetravalent titanium in the presence of a halohydrocarbon, and contacting the halogenated product with a tetravalent titanium compound.
