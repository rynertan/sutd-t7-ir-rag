# METHOD OF MAKING IMIDE PRECURSOR COMPOSITIONS FOR POLIMIDE ADHESIVES AND MATRIC MATERIALS

## Abstract
A method of making an imide precursor composition comprises a mixing a lactam component A with a tetracarboxy lic acid dianhydride component component B comprising at least 50 mole of 1,2,3,4 butanetetra carboxylic acid dianhydride in a mole ratio of A B of from 0.1 1 to 10 1 to form an N, N disubstituted bisimide dicarboxylic acid, b dissolving the product of step a in an inert solvent, and c mixing at least one aromatic diamine component C with the solution from step b to give a solution of an imide precursor which forms a polyimide on heating.
