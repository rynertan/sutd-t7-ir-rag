# Intermittent feed mechanism.

## Abstract
A mechanism, for intermittently feeding a tape like article 3, 5 along a longitudinal path, comprises a slide 10 having a first clamping jaw 14, 15 and reciprocably movable parallel to the longitudinal path, and a second clamping jaw 22, 23 carried by the slide 10 and movable relatively thereto toward and away from the first jaw 14, 15 to clamp and release the tape like article 3, 5 . At the end of the slide s forward movement, the second jaw 22, 23 is moved away from the first jaw 14, 15 and is locked in such releasing position. At the end of the slide s backward movement, the second jaw 22, 23 is unlocked and thereby returned to its clamping position.
