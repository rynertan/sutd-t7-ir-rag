# MOLTEN SALT HAZARDOUS WASTE DISPOSAL PROCESS UTILIZING GAS LIQUID CONTACT FOR SALT RECOVERY

## Abstract
The products of a molten salt combustion of hazardous wastes are converted into a cooled gas, which can be fil tered to remove hazardous particulate material, and a dry flowable mixture of salts, which can be recycled for use in the molten salt combustion, by means of gas liquid contact between the gaseous products of combustion of the hazard ous waste and a solution produced by quenching the spent melt from such molten salt combustion. The process results in maximizing the proportion of useful materials recovered from the molten salt combustion and minimizing the volume of material which must be dis carded. In a preferred embodiment a spray dryer treatment is used to achieve the desired gas liquid contact.
