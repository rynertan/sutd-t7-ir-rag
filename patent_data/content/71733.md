# Inflatable pouch and method of manufacture.

## Abstract
A fluid impervious self inflatable sealed pouch contain ing separately compartmented first and second gas generating components which, upon admixture in suc cessive discrete quantities, generate gas, causing the pouch to expand gradually from an initial collapsed con dition to an ultimately fully expanded condition. Within the pouch is a mechanically rupturable solventcontaining mem ber optimally including a measured quantity of one of said components and the other said component is enclosed by a water soluble film barrier of polyvinyl alcohol, methyl cellulose or the like, additional inner receptacles within the pouch contain measured quantities of said one component for successive release into said admixture caused by ex pansion of said pouch. A method is provided whereby the pouches are formed in a continuous manner from a plurality of film like materials fed to respective successive work stations at which recept acles and or containers are formed, components in troduced, permanent and or releasable seals are formed, water soluble barriers provided and completed pouches delivered in finished form in interconnected and or severed, independent condition for further utilization.
