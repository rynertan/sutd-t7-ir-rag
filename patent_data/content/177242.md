## Description
POLLEN FORMATION INHIBITING PYRAZOLES This invention relates to novel pyrazole derivatives which have been found to be useful in the inhibition of pollen formation. Very important improvements in the hardiness and yield of cultivated plants, particularly grains, have been made by the technique of hybridization. In the past, hybridizing those species, in which each plant produces both pollen and pollen receiving organs, has been very difficult. Compounds have been found which are capable of inhibiting formation of pollen. The use of such a compound greatly simplifies hybridization. Plants of the two strains to be crossed are simply planted adjacent to one another, as in long, relatively narrow plots, and the plots of one of the strains are treated with a pollen formation inhibitor. All of the seed produced by the treated plants will be hybrid seed, originating from pollen contributed by the untreated plants, if the pollen formation inhibitor is perfectly effective. Compounds having pollen formation inhibiting activity have been taught in U.S. Patent SpecificationNo. 4,345,934, U.S. Patent Specification No. 4,147,528 and U.S. Patent Specification No. 4,238,220. The present invention provides the pollen formation inhibiting pyrazoles of the formula EMI2.1 wherein R, R1 and R2 independently represent halo,C1 C4 alkoxy, C1 C4 alkyl or hydrogen, provided that at least one of R, R and R2 represents hydrogen, and further provided that R2 may represent a group other than hydrogen only when one of R and R1, but not both, represents a group other than hydrogen R3 represents hydroxy, C1 C4 alkoxy, C2 C4 alkenyloxy or a phytologically acceptable moiety forming a salt of the carboxylic acid. One class of compounds of this type which may be mentioned are those wherein R, R1 and R2 represent chloro, bromo, fluoro, C1 C3 alkyl or hydrogen, andR3 represents hydroxy, methoxy, ethoxy, allyloxy or a phytologically acceptable moiety forming a salt of the carboxylic acid. The invention also provides pollen formation inhibiting compositions which comprise a compound of the above formula and one or more phytologically acceptable diluents. The invention also provides a method of inhibiting pollen formation in a cereal grain plant which is sensitive to such treatment comprising supplying to the plant at a time prior to anther formation a pollen formation inhibiting amount of a compound of the above formula. Further, the invention provides a method of producing hybrid cereal grain seed having a male and a female parent variety, comprising planting seed of said male and female parent varieties in separate plots adjacent to each other, treating the female parent plants growing from said female parent seed with a pollen formation inhibiting method as just described, said female parent variety being sensitive to such treatment, allowing said treated female parent plants to be pollinated by the male parent plants growing from said male parent seed and to produce hybrid seed, and harvesting said hybrid seed from the treated female parent plants. In this document, all temperatures are described in degrees Celsius. All expressions of percentage, proportion and the like are in weight units unless otherwise stated. In the above formula, the term C1 C4 alkyl includes such groups as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, t butyl and isobutyl, and the terms C1 C4 alkoxy typically includes those groups linked through an oxygen atom. The salts of the above formula are formed with any phytologically acceptable moiety capable of forming a salt of the carboxylic acid. The preferred saltforming moieties include alkali metals, amine groups, and quaternary ammonium groups. More particularly, sodium, potassium, lithium, C1 C4 alkylamino, dialkylamino and trialkylamino groups and quaternary ammonium groups wherein the nitrogen atom is substituted with four hydrogen, C1 C4 alkyl, phenyl or benzyl moieties are more highly preferred. For example, quaternary ammonium groups such as ammonium, tetramethyl ammonium, diethyl dimethyl ammonium, diethyl dibutyl ammonium, benzyl trimethyl ammonium, t butyl trimethyl ammonium, phenyl triethyl ammonium, diethyl dipropyl ammonium, s butyl trimethyl ammonium, isobutyl triethyl ammonium and the like are useful and may be chosen for convenience in the circumstances. Further, such amines as methylamine, butylamine, triethylamine, dipropylamine and the like are convenient for salt formation. Certain classes of the compounds of the present invention are particularly preferred. One such class includes the carboxylic acids wherein R3 is hydroxy, and salts thereof. Another preferred class includes compounds wherein R1 is a group other than hydrogen, and R and R2 are hydrogen. Another preferred class includes compounds wherein R and R1 independently represent chloro, bromo, methoxy, ethyl or methyl.Still another preferred class includes the compounds wherein R and R2 are hydrogen and R1 is chloro, bromo, fluoro, C1 C2 alkyl or C1 C2 alkoxy a more preferred class includes such compounds wherein R1 is chloro, ethyl, methyl or methoxy and another more preferred class includes such compounds wherein R1 is chloro, bromo or methyl. The following group of exemplary compounds of the present invention are mentioned to assure that the reader fully understands the invention. 4 carboxy l 3 propylphenyl 5 pyrazole carboxamide l 4 ethylphenyl 4 methoxycarbonyl 5pyrazolecarboxamide 1 2,4 dibromophenyl 4 ethoxycarbonyl5 pyrazolecarboxamide 4 allyloxycarbonyl l 2 ,3 difluorophenyl 5 pyrazolecarboxamide 4 carboxy 1 3,4 diethylphenyl 5 pyrazolecarboxamide, benzyl trimethylammonium salt 4 carboxy l 4 isopropyl 2 methylphenyl 5 pyrazolecarboxamide, phenyl triethylammonium salt 4 carboxy 1 3 isobutylphenyl 5 pyrazolecarboxamide 1 4 butylphenyl 4 ethoxycarbonyl 5 pyra zolecarboxamide 1 3 t butylphenyl 4 methoxycarbonyl 5 pyrazolecarboxamide 4 carboxy 1 3 1 methylpropyl phenyl 5 pyrazolecarboxamide 4 carboxy 1 4 methyl 3 propylphenyl 5pyrazolecarboxamide, tetrapropylammonium salt 4 carboxy 1 3 isopropyl 4 propylphenyl 5pyrazolecarboxamide, trimethylamine salt 1 3 bromo 2 chlorophenyl 4 carboxy 5 pyrazolecarboxamide, diethyl dipropylammonium salt 1 4 bromo 3 propylphenyl 4 carboxy 5 pyra zolecarboxamide, diphenyl dimethylammonium salt 1 2 bromo 4 methylphenyl 4 carboxy 5 pyra zolecarboxamide, benzyl triethylammonium salt 1 3 bromo 4 methylphenyl 4 carboxy 5 pyrazolecarboxamide 4 carboxy 1 4 fluoro 3 methylphenyl 5 pyrazolecarboxamide 4 carboxy l 4 ethyl 2 fluorophenyl 5 pyrazolecarboxamide, lithium salt 4 carboxy l 3 ,4 difluorophenyl 5 pyrazole carboxamide, tetra isobutyl ammonium salt 4 carboxy l 2 propyl 4 fluorophenyl 5 pyra zolecarboxamide, butyl trimethylammonium salt 4 carboxy 1 3 ethoxyphenyl 5 pyrazolecarboxamide, sodium salt 4 methoxycarbonyl 1 4 propoxyphenyl 5pyrazolecarboxamide 1 3 isopropoxyphenyl 4 methoxycarbonyl 5pyrazolecarboxamide and 4 carboxy l 3 methoxyphenyl 5 pyrazole carboxamide, potassium salt. The compounds of the present invention can be prepared by a process whose first step is the reaction of an aryl hydrazine with an alkyl alkoxymethylene cyanoacetate to prepare the corresponding l phenyl 5 amino lH 4 pyrazolecarboxylate. Next, the aminopyrazole is converted to the corresponding 5 halopyrazolecarboxylate, which is then converted to the 5 cyanopyrazolecarboxylate. That compound is the key intermediate for the preparation of the present pollen formation inhibitors. In the final step of the basic process, the 5 cyano 4 pyrazolecarboxylate is hydrolyzed preferably with a strong base such as potassium hydroxide, to prepare the desired 4 carboxy 5 pyrazolecarboxamide.The reaction scheme is illustrated below.EMI7.1 In the above scheme, the term Alk refers to Cl C4 alkyl groups, and the term Halo refers to chloro or bromo. All of the steps of the processes described in this document proceed in acceptable yields without the use of unusual excess quantities of any reactant.In general, equimolar quantities can be used with satisfactory results. However, as is usual in organic reactions, it is preferable and advisable to use an excess amount of reactants which are inexpensive or easy to obtain, in order to assure full utilization of reactants which are expensive or difficult to obtain.Similarly, the steps of the process may be allowed to proceed for a long period of time, to maximize yield of the desired product, or may be halted before the reaction is complete, to maximize throughput of product from the system. Either manner of operating a process may be preferable, depending on the circumstances. In the first step of the above scheme, it is most preferred to use aqueous acetic acid as the reaction solvent. An inorganic acetate salt in the reaction mixture is also beneficial, in some cases. However, the reaction of the hydrazine with the cyanoacetate may also be carried out in any suitable organic solvent, particularly a lower alkanol such as methanol or ethanol. The preferred reaction temperature is elevated, in the range of about 50 1500. It will be understood that temperatures above the boiling point of the reaction mixture may be used at elevated pressures. However, the reactions will go at any reasonable temperature, such as about 0 2000, if appropriate operating care is used. The halogenation step of the above scheme is preferably carried out with nitrosyl chloride as both the diazotizing and halogenating agent, resulting in a 5 chloropyrazole. It is conventional to use nitrosyl chloride as a gas, by bubbling it through the vigorously mixed reaction mixture. The present chlorination is carried out in any non reactive organic solvent, most preferably in a halogenated alkane such as chloroform, carbon tetrachloride and the like. Moderate temperatures in the range of 0 50 are preferred, in order to maximize the solubility of nitrosyl chloride in the reaction mixture. 5 Bromopyrazole intermediates are prepared with an alkyl nitrite as the diazotizing agent, and an eppropriate halogen source. Isoamyl nitrite, t butyl nitrite and the like are appropriate diazotizing agents, and bromoform and elemental bromine are convenient sources of bromine. The reaction conditions are substantially the same as those for chlorinations. Cyanation of the 5 halopyrazole is carried out in a conventional manner with an alkali metal cyanide, such as sodium cyanide, lithium cyanide or potassium cyanide. The cyanation can be done in inert organic solvents of which aprotic solvents are preferred. For example, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide and hexamethylphosphoramide are particularly preferred solvents in this step. It is preferred to cyanate at elevated temperatures in the range of about 50 2000, most preferably about 80 1400. The hydrolysis step, which prepares the 4 carboxy 5 pyrazolecarboxamide, is most conveniently carried out with potassium hydroxide in aqueous ethanol.Conventionally, the base is dissolved in a minimum amount of water, and added to ethanol to prepare the reaction medium. Other alkali metal hydroxides, such as sodium hydroxide and lithium hydroxide, are also useful for the process. Similarly, other reaction solvents besides aqueous ethanol are useful, particularly other aqueous alkanols such as methanol, propanol and isopropanol. The hydrolysis is preferably carried out at a moderately elevated temperature in the range of about 50 1000, most preferably at the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture. An improved method of preparing certain alkylaryl hydrazines, particularly 3 methyl and 3 ethylphenylhydrazines, is carried out by reacting the corresponding aniline with sodium nitrite to prepare the diazonium salt, and reacting the salt with potassium sulfite as described in Houben Weyl, Methoden derOrganische Chemie, Via1. 10 2, p. 180 1967 . The preparations below illustrate the preparation of an aryl hydrazine by the process just described. Should one not want to use an alkyl alkoxymethylene cyanoacetate in the cyclization, the pyrazole can also be formed by reacting the aryl hydrazine with a dialkyl alkoxymethylenemalonate under basic conditions in an aqueous reaction mixture such as aqueous ethanol.Such a cyclization prepares a pyrazole having a hydroxy group at the 5 position and an alkoxycarbonyl at the 4 position. The next step in such a sequence is to hydrolyze the hydroxypyrazole in an acid environment such as acidic alcohol, which step removes the alkoxycarbonyl group. The resulting intermediate is then reacted with a Vilsmeier reagent to replace the hydroxy group with a chlorine atom, and, simultaneously, to insert a formyl group at the 4 position. The formyl is converted to an alkoxycarbonyl by reaction in an alkanol with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of sulfuric acid. The resulting product is a 5 chloro 4alkoxycarbonylpyrazole, which is converted to the nitrile as described in the basic process discussed above. Salts of the 4 carboxy 5 pyrazolecarboxamides are readily prepared in the usual ways, as by contacting the compound with the appropriate base in an aqueous alkanol or aqueous ketone. When an alkali metal salt is desired, the base can be any appropriate alkali metal hydroxide, alkoxide, carbonate or bicarbonate. When a quaternary ammonium salt is to be made, the appropriate quaternary ammonium halide, sulfonate, hydroxide, methanesulfonate or the like is combined with the acid in a suitable organic solvent. Salts are formed at moderate temperatures in the range of 0 100 . Compounds wherein the 4 carboxy group has been esterified are easily prepared in the usual manner, by reacting the 4 carboxy compound with methanol, allyl alcohol or ethanol in an organic solvent, preferably in the presence of a small amount of a mineral acid as esterification catalyst. Esters are also prepared by reacting an alkali metal salt of the acid with an allyl, methyl or ethyl halide. Moderate temperatures in the range of 50 100 are quite satisfactory, and the reaction times are usually brief. Coupling agents may be used to assist esterifications but are not usually necessary. The following Preparations and Examples are shown further to assist the reader in preparing the compounds of the present invention. Example 1 4 Carboxy l 3 chlorophenyl 5 pyrazole carboxamide.

The compounds of the present invention have been carefully tested to demonstrate their activity in inhibiting the formation of pollen. The results of those tests are shown below. Test 1 The experiment recorded here was a field experiment carried out in central Indiana, U.S.A. The experiment was started by planting strips of Auburn andBeau wheat in the autumn. Some strips were planted onOctober 4, and others on October 14. The field was fertilized at the time of planting with a combination of fertilizers appropriate for the growth of wheat.Adjacent the strips of Auburn and Beau wheat were planted pollen shedding plots of mixed Caldwell, Auburn and Titan wheat in the ratio 1 1 2. The pollen shedding plots were planted on October 1 at the rate of 100 lb.of seed per acre. The test compound in this experiment was that of Example 1 above. The compound was formulated for application in 1 1 by volume acetone denatured alcohol.The organic solution was diluted in water, containing 0.25 of polysorbate 20 for application. All applications were at the volume rate of 500 gallons per acre, and were applied as a foliar spray to the test plots. The first application of compound was made onApril 26 following the planting of the wheat. Where multiple applications of compound were made, the later applications were at intervals of one week. The test plots were laid out in the bands ofAuburn and Beau wheat, which became the female plots for the production of hybrid wheat, pollinated by the pollen shedding plots of wheat. Each test plot was 4 rows x 13 ft. in size. At the time of wheat head emergence, some heads in each treated plot were bagged with small grain pollinator glassine bags. Five heads in each row of each test plot were bagged. When the seed was formed, the number of seeds per head in the bagged plants provided a measure of the extent to which pollen formation was inhibited, because those seed could have been formed only by self pollination.The number of seeds per head in unbagged plants in each test plot was also counted, as was the number of seeds per head in untreated control plots. Two plots were treated according to each treatment regime and the results are averaged in the table below. The data are reported separately below for each variety of wheat and each planting date. The earlier planted plots are described as age 1 , and the later as age 2 . The columns headed fertility report the number of seeds per head of the treated bagged plants, as percentage of untreated controls, and therefore give a direct measurement of pollen formation. The columns headed hybrid report the difference between the number of seeds per head of treated unbagged plants and seeds per head of treated bagged plants, as percentage of untreated controls. Thus, that column reports the amount of hybrid seed produced, compared to the seed produced by untreated control plants.The purity of the hybrid seed produced may be estimated by comparing the fertility percentage with the hybrid percentage.

Each test plot consisted of three 2 ft. hand planted rows, with 2 ft. spaces between the groups of three. The plots were planted in centralIndiana on October 5.On the following May 5, two of the three replicates were sprayed with the compound ofExample 1 at 5 ib. per acre and 10 ib. per acre, and the third replicate provided an untreated control. Plants were bagged, and the seed set of bagged, unbagged and untreated plants were counted as described in Test 1. Pollen for these experiments was provided by bands of the same pollen shedding mixture of wheat described in Test 1. The data from this group of experiments are reported below in summary form, as the number of the wheat varieties which exhibited fertility of the bagged treated plants in various ranges, compared to the fertility of untreated control plants.

The test was begun by planting Waldron wheat in 4 inch pots, 4 seeds per pot, in a sterilized sand loam soil. The wheat was allowed to grow in a favorable greenhouse environment, and the plants were treated 3 times with a test compound. The first application was about 22 days after the seed was planted, and the second and third applications were about 3 and about 10 days after the first. Each compound was formulated for testing by dissolving the proper amount for two replicates and three applications, depending on the concentration to be tested, in 5 ml. of 1 1 by volume acetone denatured alcohol, containing 10 by volume of polysorbate 20.Compounds which did not dissolve were finely dispersed in the solvent. The organic mixture was then diluted to 30 ml. with deionized water at about ambient temperature, and the aqueous dispersion was evenly sprayed over the foliage of two pots of wheat. Untreated control plants were provided in each experiment. The results of experiments are reported below as the number of spike lets produced by the treated plants, and the number of seed per spikelet. The average number of spike lets per normal plant is about 15, and the number of seed per spikelet varies in the range of about 1.5 to 2.5.

The alkali metal salts, ammonium salts and mono, di and tri C1 C4 alkyl amine salts of the compounds just named are also preferred compounds of the invention. The compounds of this invention are useful for inhibiting pollen formation in cereal grain plants which are sensitive to such treatment, and the compositions in which the compounds are formulated for application, and the methods by which the compounds are applied to obtain the inhibition of pollen formation, constitute embodiments of the invention. A compound must be supplied to the plant before the formation of anthers. It must be noted that the head of a plant matures over a period of time, and different plants in a field mature at different times.Accordingly, a compound must be supplied before anther formation in the most mature plants in the field to be treated, if best results are to be obtained. In wheat and barley, anther formation occurs while the plant s head is still near ground level, and is about 2 mm. long, and the plant has about 4 to 5 true leaves. Thus, it is advisable to dissect representative plants from time to time to determine when development of the head, and therefore of the anthers, is approaching.Best results are obtained by supplying the compound when the head is only a few mm. long. Comparable indications of development in other species are used to determine the proper time for treatment. The compound must be supplied, not merely applied, to the plant before anther formation. In this document, the term supplying is used to mean administering the compound in such a manner that it is absorbed by the plant and is available to the target organs. In all cases, the compound must be applied sufficiently early that it is absorbed and supplied to the plant before anther formation. In the practice of the present invention, it is necessary to apply an effective amount of a compound of the invention to the plant or the soil in which it grows. Effective amounts can be measured in terms of the concentration of the compound in a dispersion, when the compound is applied to the foliage, or, preferably, can be measured in terms of the amount of compound applied per unit area of land. The concentration of the compound is a useful measurement, because the amount of compound applied to foliage is limited by the amount of the dispersion which is retained by the foliage. That amount is substantially constant, for a given size of plant, and therefore the amount of compound applied by that means can be increased only by increasing the concentration of the dispersion. Depending on the circumstances, effective concentrations of compounds range from about 100 to about 2000 parts per million by weight. Factors which affect the effective amount include the succulence of the foliage, the rate at which it is growing, and the weather at the time of application. In general, preferred concentrations for foliar applications are in the range from about 500 to about 1500 parts per million by weight. Measurement of the amount of compound applied as a dose per unit area of land may be used for either application to the soil or application to the foliage.Of course, it will be understood that application to the foliage results in some soil application in all cases, since not all of the composition applied to the foliage adheres there. In general, rates of from about 1 to about 40 pounds of compound per acre of crop land are useful. It is more preferred to use rates from about 1 to about 20 pounds per acre, most preferably, from about 1 to about 10 pounds per acre of the most preferred compounds. It has been observed that application of the compound in multiple doses provides better effectiveness, and there is some indication that a smaller total amount of compound can effectively be used when applied in multiple doses. It may be that the result is explained by the fact that not all plants form anthers at the same time, and multiple applications avoid the necessity for compounds to be stored for a long period in the plant or soil. Application of a compound from 2 to 4 times, at intervals of 3 to 10 days, is preferred. More particularly, application of a compound of the invention from 2 to 3 times, where each application is of from about 1 2 to about 3 pounds of compound per acre, applied to the foliage, is particularly preferred. Further, application of the compound from 2 to 3 times, where each application is of a dispersion containing from about 200 to about 1000 parts per million by weight of compound, and the dispersion is applied so as to cover the foliage of the plants, is also preferred. Another particularly preferred method of application of a compound of the invention is application to the soil in which the plants grow at a rate of from about 1 to about 10 pounds of compound per acre, applied once. The plants to which a compound of the present invention may be applied to inhibit pollen formation are the cereal grain plants, including wheat, barley, corn, oats, rye, rice, sorghum and triticale. A preferred group of species include wheat, barley, rye and triticale. The more preferred species of plants are wheat and barley, and the most preferred species is wheat. More particularly, the plants to which the invention is applied are defined as those which are sensitive to such treatment that is, those in which the compounds will inhibit pollen formation when properly applied. The plants are defined in that manner because considerable variation in activity between varieties, and between individuals within a variety, has been observed. In barley, for example, some varieties require several times as much compound for activity as do other varieties. On the other hand, the varietal difference in activity in wheat is relatively small. In other species, of which corn is a particularly good example, the differences in sensitivity to the compounds are more subtle than varietal differences. In corn, individual sensitive plants have been observed, although no variety wherein all plants are sensitive has been found. It is therefore necessary, in such a species, to screen for sensitive plants, and to use the seed produced by those plants to create a variety of sensitive plants for further use in hybridization. Of course, some experimentation is needed to use the present invention properly, particularly in species such as corn. The experimentation, however, is well understood and routinely carried out by plant breeders. The nature of the tests is clearly shown above in the test portion of this document, and so the skilled reader can readily plan routine experiments which will identify sensitive plants or varieties and determine the proper application rate of a compound, by the ordinary skills of the art, and the teaching in this document. A further aspect of the present invention is the production of hybrid seed by use of the present pollen formation inhibiting method. Seed of the varieties which will be the male and female parents is planted in separate but adjacent plots. The female parent variety, of course, must be sensitive to the treatment of the present invention. The size and location of the plots may be important. Some species, such as wheat and barley, do not produce great quantities of pollen, as corn does, and so the pollen cannot be expected to travel very far and still fertilize a high percentage of the female plants. Therefore, the female plots should be relatively narrow. For example, the female and male parent seed may usefully be planted in long alternate plots, only a few rows wide, with their long axes oriented across the prevailing wind. It has been observed to be advantageous to plant the female parent variety seed densely enough to inhibit the plants from developing tillers. The reason is that tillers develop later than the main plants, and therefore their presence confuses the determination of the proper time to apply the compound. At the proper time, as discussed above in detail, the compound is applied to the female parent plots to inhibit those plants from producing pollen.Those plants are then pollinated by the male parent plants and produce hybrid seed, which is harvested in the usual ways. The compositions in which a compound of the present invention may be formulated are of many types.Since the compounds are effective when applied both to the foliage of the plants, and to the soil in which the plants grow, substantially all of the physical types of agricultural chemical compositions may be used. Most economical and preferred compositions are concentrated water emulsifiable or water dispersable compositions. Such compositions include, in general, emulsifiable concentrates, suspension concentrates and wettable powders and granules, all of which are common in the agricultural chemical art. Some discussion of them will be provided, however, to assure complete understanding. The concentration of a compound in a concentrated composition is entirely irrelevant to the use of the compound. Such compositions are diluted in water for application, and the application rate of the compound is determined by the ratio at which the composition is diluted in water, or by the amount of the composition which is applied per area of crop land.Thus, any desired application rate can be obtained from any concentrated composition. Such compositions will typically contain from about 1 to about 95 percent of the active ingredient. Emulsifiable concentrates of the compounds comprise a convenient concentration of the compound dissolved in a phytologically acceptable diluent which is a mixture of water miscible organic solvent and emulsifiers. Useful organic solvents, in general, include aromatics, especially xylenes, and the petroleum fractions, especially the napthalenic and olefinic portions of petroleum, such as those called heavy aromatic naphthas. Terpenic solvents including rosin derivatives, and complex alcohols such as 2 ethoxyethanol are also often used, and amides such as dimethylacetamide may be particularly useful with the present compounds. Suitable emulsifiers for emulsifiable concentrates, generally used in amounts in the range of from about 1 to about 10 by weight of the concentrate, are frequently found among the alkylbenzenesulfonates, the alkyl sulfates, the non ionics such as ethylene oxide adducts of alkyl phenol, and especially among the metal and amine salts of alkyl sulfates. Wettable powders comprise an intimate mixture of the compound and a phytologically acceptable diluent made up of an inert carrier and surfactants. The inept carrier is usually chosen from among easily water di spers able powdery substances such as attapulgite clay, the montmorillonite clays, the diatomaceous earths and the purified silicates. Surfactants for wettable powders are found among the same types just mentioned for emulsifiable concentrates, as well as the sulfonated lignins and the naphthalenesulfonates. It is possible to compact a wettable powder into granular form, and thereby to produce a wettable granule, which has the advantage of being non dusty and easy to measure and pour. When added to water, a properly formulated wettable granular product will disperse and become a fine suspension. The compounds may also be formulated as suspensions, which consist of a relatively high concentration, in the interest of economy, of the compound in finely powdered form, dispersed and suspended in a phytologically acceptable aqueous diluent. A surfactant system for a suspension product is much like that used in a wettable powder, but it must be capable of maintaining the compound in dispersed form over a long period of time. It is sometimes advisable to adjust the density of the liquid, as by dissolving an inert salt in it, in order to assist in the suspension of the relatively dense particles of compound. When an aqueous dispersion of a compound, prepared by the dilution of a concentrated composition, is to be applied to foliage, an adjuvant is often used to improve the ability of the dispersion to wet and adhere to the foliage. Such adjuvants as vegetable gums, emulsified polybutenes, cationic and other surfactants and lignin derivatives are often used. The use of an adjuvant in aqueous dispersions of the present compounds is highly preferred, and regularly improves results. Not only the commercial adjuvants, which are commonly known to growers, but also ordinary surfactants, are beneficially used, at concentrations in the range of a few tenths of a percent in the dispersion. Agueous dispersions of concentrated compositions may be applied either to foliage or to the soil in which plants grow. When the application is to be to the soil, a granular composition can also be effectively used. A granular agricultural composition consists of the compound, applied1 usually in a relatively low concentration such as from about 1 to about 10 by weight, to a granular carrier having a convenient particle size for application. Typically, the particle size range is from 20 to 60 mesh, on the standard U.S.sieve size scale. Such carriers as clay, sand, pulverized stone, corncob grits and the like are frequently used and may be chosen for convenience and economy. It is usually unnecessary to use any adjuvant or other ingredient other than the compound and the carrier, with perhaps a small amount of solvent in which the compound is applied to the carrier. The carrier may also be supplied in powdered form, and formulated by mixing the powdered carrier with the powdered compound and then compacting the mixture and granulating it to the desired particle size range. The following specific examples of formulations of compounds of the present invention are provided to assist the reader. It will be understood that the following formulations, all of which were used in the tests described above in the specification, are merely exemplary of the manners of formulating the compounds.
