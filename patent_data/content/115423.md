# Filler unit for topping up a container with liquid.

## Abstract
A battery filler unit for automatically filling a battery container to a predetermined level consists of a vessel 10 containing liquid to be dispensed into the battery. The vessel is supplied with liquid in a manner to maintain a constant head in the vessel. An orifice 12 in the bottom of the vessel above a downpipe 14 , extending in use into the top of a battery 16 , ensures that an air seal is formed across the orifice by the action of surface tension of the dispensing liquid. As the container fills, air is trapped in the downpipe and dispensing of liquid from the vessel ceases when a pressure equilibrium is established, at which time the liquid level in the container will be at a predetermined desired level.
