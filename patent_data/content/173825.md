# Improvements in the pressure gauges for fire extinguishers, permitting to check the efficiency of said extinguishers.

## Abstract
Improvemente in the pressure gauges for fire extinguishers and the like, more particularly in the pressure gauges of the axial movement type, comprising a calibrated coil spring B and a sensitive plunger A submitted to the pressure existing in the container, said improvements comprising the provision of a thin rod or stem 7 axially arranged through the pressure gauge to engage said plunger and including a pushbutton 6 on the outer end thereof, and the provision of an indicating pointer 3 having a gooseneck formation permitting said pointer to move past the center of the pressure gauge without interferring with said rod, the arrangement being such that, when a check of efficiency is desired, said pushbutton of the thin rod is just to be depressed, whereby said calibrated spring is tempo rarily put out of service, thus permitting the pointer of the gauge to move back to the zero position thereafter, when the depressing action against the pushbutton is discontinued, said pointer should resume the original position.

## Claims
1 In a pressure gauge for fire extinguishers, the inprove ments permitting to check the efficiency of the extinguishers, particularly designed for application on the conventional, axial type pressure gauges comprising a calibrated coil spring and a small plunger which is submitted to the pressure in the container, said improvements being characterized in that the transparent disc covering the dial is formed with a central seat having a circular raised rim for accommodating a push button which is fixed to an end of an axially movable thin rod or stem which is passed through the center of the pressure gauge to reach the top end of the corresponding sensitive plunger, while the indicating pointer has a gooseneck formation whereby it can move past the center of the pressure gauge without interferring with said rod, the arrangement being such as to permit a test of efficiency by a simple depression on said pushbutton.

## Description
This invention relates to improvements in the pressure gauges for fire extinguishers, which permit to check or test the efficiency of said extinguishers as required by the present regulations in the art. These regulations, issued by the EEC European Economic Community , require a regular periodical check of the operating efficiency of fire extinguishers therefore, the manufacturers in this field have endevoured to develop a method of ascertaining the correct operation of a pressure gauge without discharging the pressure from the fire extinguisher. To this end, it was proposed a system involving the removal, by breakage, of the transparent disc or glass that covers the dial of a pressure gauge, and the introduction of a pointed tool adapted to act against the diaphragm through a suitable bore formed purposely in the dial. By depressing said tool and, therefore, said diaphragm, the indicating pointer should move back, and then it should advance again to the previous position when said tool is withdrawn. In fact, said diaphragm, if no longer depressed and if the proper pressure exists in the extinguisher, should resume the position it had before said check was effected. If this is the case, the fire extinguisher is operatively okay. This is an acceptable solution, but the trouble is that, upon each test, a transparent glass of the pressure gauge is to be broken and then replaced with a new one, which requires comparatively complicated special purpose tools, not always available. Pressure gauges for fire extinguishers have also been produced which are not provided with said diaphragm and which comprise a calibrated coil spring arranged axially in the gauge and compressed through an axially movable plunger. In these gauges, the mechanism comprises a system for converting the axial movement into a rotary movement for the actuation of the indicating pointer. These gauges operate with no problem, but their manufacturing cost is somewhat high. In view of the ECC regulations mentioned above, it has become desired to study, in the pressure gauges of the last mentioned type, a simplified checking system to be carried out without requiring the previous relieving of pressure. The result of this study has been satisfactory and such as to permit an instantaneous check or test with no preliminary operations and with no tools therefore, the invention is deemed worthy to be protected. The solution according to the invention is simple in the manufacturing step, the gauge of the type mentioned above, having no diaphragm, but comprising a calibrated axial spring is provided with a dial protecting transparent disc or glass having a small central hole surrounded by a hub and a raised reinforcing rim. These features enable the axial slidable arrangement of a thin rod or stem having an external pushbutton and of such a length as to operate, through the centers of the dial and the underlying calibrated coil spring, against the small plunger responsive to the load of the internal pressure in the fire extinguisher bottle, whereby said load is eliminated. Therefore, if everything is in order, the indicating pointer should move back to the zero position and, thereafter, move again to the original position as soon as the depression on said pushbutton is discontinued. Since the indicating pointer, having an off center pivot, must clear unhindered the center of the dial, including now the test rod according to the invention, the invention provides an indicating pointer which instead of the usual rectilinear configuration has a gooseneck formation, which permits the pointer to move past the center of the dial without interferring with said test rod, thus permitting a normal operation. The invention may be carried out in a very simple manner and during the normal manufacturing cycle, whereby its cost is very low. The accompanying drawing shows, as a non limitating example, a preferred embodiment of the invention. In the drawing The illustrated embodiment is a pressure gauge for fire extinguishers in the range of pressures of 0 to 20 bar, but of course these pressures might be different. This pressure gauge, as stated above, is of the axial movement type comprising a cup shaped plunger A provided with a sealing O ring which is subject to the pressure in the bottle and a calibrated spring B substituting for the usual diaphragm or Bourdon spring. As illustrated clearly in the Figures, the details of the improve ments according to the invention are only the transparent disc shaped member 1 engaged conventionally on the circular body 2 of the pressure gauge, the indicating pointer 3 and the dial 4. The disc shaped member 1, as best shown in the sectional view of Fig. 2, is formed with a central seat having a circular raised rim 5 and accommodating a pushbutton 6 which is fixed on the top end of a thin rod 7 which is slidably movable through the centers of the transparent disc shaped member 1 and dial 4 to reach, through the hub 8 of the gauge and the calibrated spring B, the head of the sensitive plunger A and act thereagainst when depressed. The other improvement concerns the indicating pointer 3 which, as best shown in Fig. 1, has a gooseneck formation so as to permit the pointer to move past the center of the dial without interferring with the rod 7. When a test of efficiency is to be carried out, one shall just depress the pushbutton 6, observe whether the pointer 3 moves back to the zero position, release the pushbutton and finally ascertain whether the pointer 3 moves again to the position it had previously. The test of efficiency is thus completed, with the advantages of requiring no special auxiliary tool and of permitting, if desired, to repeat the test at any moment with no preliminary operation. Obviously, on the basis of the same inventive principles, said improvements may also be applied, still within the scope of the invention, to other types of pressure gauges, such as the diaphragm or the Bourdon spring types. In these instances, the test rod may be arranged radially or in any other position to engage either the diaphragm or the Bourdon spring interiorly so as to act thereon and cause the zero setting of the indicating pointer, and all within the basic principles of the invention and liable to further changes and improvements.
