# Improved nickel boride polymer catalyst.

## Abstract
The invention provides a novel, active hydrogenation catalyst comprising nickelboride stabilized with a vinylpyrro lidone group containing polymer, said catalyst satisfies a certain activity test in the hydrogenation of soybean oil. The invention further provides a method for the preparation of said catalyst involving the use of a nickel salt containing less than 6, preferably less than 5 molecules of crystal water.
