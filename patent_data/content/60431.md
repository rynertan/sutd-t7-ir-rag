# Apparatus for measurement of the yield of fluorescent radiation.

## Abstract
Method and means useful in reflectance measurement is provided wherein radiation of one wavelength is separated from radiation of a different wavelength by the use of a composite of at least two components, one of which is absorptive of said one wavelength radiation and is highly transmissive of said other wavelength radiation, and the other of which is reflective of radiation of both of said wavelengths. The method and means are particularly adapted for use in fluorescent radiation measurement to prevent high intensive residual incident excitation radiation from interfering with measurement of the relatively low intensity fluorescent radiation.
