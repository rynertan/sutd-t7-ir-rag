# External bead removing tool.

## Abstract
A device for removing a weld bead from the external periphery of a plastic gas pipe. The device has a body 10 with an inclined reaction surface 13 and a blade 21 . The blade 21 is engaged with a bead 22 and the portion 22a of the bead 22 which is lifted is gripped between a toothed wheel 17 and the inclined surface 21 . As the wheel 17 is rotated by use of a lever 18 operating via a ratchet, the device is moved bodily around the circumference of a pipe 31 to remove the bead 22 . Retractable and adjustable stabilising means 25, 28 etc. are provided and there is a hardened end portion 20 on the body 10 to enable the device to be hammered to engage the blade in the bead initially.
