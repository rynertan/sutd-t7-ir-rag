# Apparatus for spreading covering material.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a procedure and an arrangement for spreading pulverised or granular additive material, preferably covering material, on the surface of a metal melt, preferably a steel melt, which is in an open metallurgical ladle by means of a spreading arrangement whereby at least a predetermined quantity of additive is made available in a dosing container whereby the dose is sub divided into partial doses, the ladle is placed underneath the dosing container, the additive dose is made to fall under its own weight onto the surface of the metal melt and is spread out on the surface by means of a spreader which is connected to the dosing container. The arrangement for performing the procedure compris es a spreader 1 which consists of two or more concentrical ly arranged truncated tubular cones 2 , a dosing container 3 , two valves 8 , 9 for filling and emptying respectively the container 3 . The dosing container 3 is provided with two or more concentrically arranged tubular elements 4 adjoining to the tubular cones 2 which comprise walls in concentrically arranged divisional containers and connected to a filling hopper which is common to all the divisional containers and above which a transport container 12 is placed.
