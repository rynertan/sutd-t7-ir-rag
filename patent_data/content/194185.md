# COMPUTER SYSTEM HAVING INSTRUCTION SURVEILLANCE CONFIGURATION

## Abstract
A processing unit 10 includes a first circuit 4 storing at least one instruction code groupe having a plurality of subinstruction codes performing a corresponding micropro gram instruction a second circuit 1, 2, 3, 5 decoding a mi croprogram instruction and advancing an address of subin structions of the microprogram instruction in response to contents of the subinstruction codes and a third circuit 6 executing the subinstructions in response to subinstruction codes from circuit 4 . The circuit 4 further stores other sub instruction codes performing control of the instruction processing circuit in a debug mode operation. A control unit 40 compares an address preset thereto and another ad dress from the instruction decode circuit designating the subinstruction codes in the instruction code store circuit, stops the operation of the subinstruction and supplies control data including control bits and an address designating the other subinstruction codes when the preset address coin cides with the other address. The circuit 6 executes subin structions of the other subinstruction codes in response to the control bits to monitor each subinstruction s operation state. The control unit may thus restore the stopped opera tion of the subinstruction when a reset signal is supplied thereto.
