## Abstract
An insert type and milling cutter and cutting insert B for the same which facilitates metal removal. Each insert B has a cutting edge 92 which is defined by the inter section of a cutting face and a land area. The cutting face is disposed so as to have a neutral rake angle and the cut ting edge 92 itself lies in a single plane but has a general ly sinusoidal configuration in a direction normal to the cut ting face. The milling cutter includes a plurality of insert locating grooves 18 which locate the inserts B in a manner such that the cutting edges 92 form straight helixes over at least a portion of the cutter length. The in serts B may be reasonably retained in the locating grooves 18 to facilitate ease of removal for repair or replacement purposes.
