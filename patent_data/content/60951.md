## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO N ALKYLATED DIPHENYLAMINE DERIVATIVES This invention relates to certain N alkylated diphenylamine derivatives which are useful in control ling insects, arachnids and ectoparasites. U.S. Patent Specification No. 4,117,167 discloses compounds similar to those of the present invention except that in that document the central nitrogen atom of the diphenylamine system is not alkylated. It has now been discovered that alkylation of that central nitrogen atom dramatically reduces the phytotoxicity of this class of compounds, and thus renders them useful as pesticides in areas of economically important plant cultivation. Thus, in accordance with the invention, diphenylamine derivatives of Formula I EMI1.1 wherein R methyl, ethyl, or n propyl each R1 ws independently bromo, chloro, or fluoro Rê is iodo, cyano, nitro, or trifluoromethyl m is an integer of from 0 to 5 n is an integer of from 0 te 1 and the sum of m and n is an integer 1 when n is 0, from 1 to 5 and 2 when n is 1, from 1 to 3 subject to the further limitations that 1 not more than two RÚ groups represent bromo 2 where Rê iodo, the iodo is located at the 4 position 3 whereR2 cyano, the cyano is located at the 3 , 4 , or 5 position and 4 where R2 N02, the N02 is located at the 2 , 3 , 5 , or 6 position, are useful in controlling insects, arachnids and ectoparasites. Certain diphenylamines of formula I are novel, these compounds have the formula 11 EMI2.1 wherein R is, as above, methyl, ethyl, or n propyl and 3Rp is one of the following 1 p 0 2 p 1 and R3 2 F, 3 F, 2 C1, or 2 Br 3 p 2 and R3 2 F 6 Br or 2 F 6 C1 or 4 p 2, 3, or 4 and each R3 F. The novel compounds of the present invention include the following N methyl , ethyl , or n propyl 4 fluoro 2 ,4 dinitro 6 trifluoromethyl diphenylamine N methyl , ethyl , or n propyl 2,4 difluoro 2 ,4 dinitro 6 trifluoromethyl diphenylamine N methyl , ethyl , or n propyl 3,4 difluoro 2 ,4 dinitro 6 trifluoromethyl diphenylamine N methyl , ethyl , or n propyl 2 bromo 4fluoro 2 ,4 dinitro 6 trifluoromethyl diphenylamine N methyl , ethyl , or n propyl 2 chloro4 fluoro 2 ,4 dinitro 6 trifluoromethyl diphenylamine N methyl , ethyl , or n propyl 2,4,6 trifluoro 2 ,4 dinitro 6 trifluoromethyl diphenylamine N methyl , ethyl , or n propyl 2,3,4 trifluoro 2 ,4 dinitro 6 trifluoromethyl diphenylamine N methyl , ethyl , or n propyl 2,4,5 trifluoro 2 ,4 dinitro 6 trifluoromethyl diphenylamine N methyl , ethyl , or n propyl 3,4,5 trifluoro 2 ,4 dinitro 6 trifluoromethyl diphenylamine N methyl , ethyl 1 or n propyl 2,4 difluoro6 bromo 2 ,4 dinitro 6 trifluoromethyl diphenylamine N methyl , ethyl , or n propyl 2,4 difluoro 6 chloro 2 t4 dinitro 6 trifluoromethyl diphenylamine N methyl , ethyl , or n propyl 2,3,4,5 tetrafluoro 2 ,4 dinitro 6 trifluoromethyl diphenylamine N methyl , ethyl , or n propyl 2,3,4,6 tetra fluoro 2 , 4 dinitro 6 trifluoromethyl diphenylamine N methyl , ethyl , or n propyl 2, 3,4,5,6 pentafluoro 2 ,4 dinitro 6 trifluoromethyl diphenylamine All of the diphenylamines of formula I are useful for the control of phytophagous insects and arachnids. Therefore, in one aspect of the invention there is provided a method for inhibiting a phytophagous insect or arachnid which comprises applying to a locus of the insect or arachnid an effective insect or arachnid inhibiting amount of a diphenylamine of formula I . However, although the present compounds exhibit moderate insecticidal activity, they exhibit a higher order of activity against arachnids, especially the Acarina mites . Therefore, in a preferred embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method for inhibiting a phytophagous mite which comprises applying to a plant a miticidally effective amount of a diphenylamine in accordance with the present invention. Representative mite species with which the present invention can be practiced include those listed in the following table.Family Scientific Name Common Name ACARI DAE Aleurobius farinae Flour mite Rhizoglyphus echinopus Bulb mite Rhizoglyphus elongatus Elongate mite Rhizoglyphus rhizophagus Root mite Rhizoglyphus sagittatae Balsam root mite Rhizoglyphus tarsalis Beet mite ERIOPHYIDAE Abacarus hystrix Aceria brachytarsus Aceria essigi Redberry mite Aceria ficus Aceria fraxinivorus Aceria granati Aceria parapopuli Cottonwood mite Aceria sheldoni Citrus bud mite Aceria tulipae Wheat curl mite Aculus schlechtendali Apple rust mite Er iophyes convolvens Eriophyes insidiosus Eriophyes malifoliae Apple leaf mite Eriophyes padi Plum twig gall mite Eriophyes pruni Plum leaf gall mite Eriophyes pyri Pear leaf blister mite Eriophyes ramosus Juniper mite Eriophyes ribis Currant gall mite Eriophyes vitis Grape erineum mite Phyllocoptes gracilis Blackberry mite Phyllocoptruta oleivora Citrus rust mite Phytoptus avellanae Filbert mite Phytoptus ribis Trisetacus pini Pine needle mite Via sates amygdalina David peach mite Vasates cornutus Peach silver mite Vasates eurynotus Celery rust mite Via sates schlechtendali Rusty leaf miteEUPODIDAE Linopodes spp PENTHALEIDAE Halotydeus destrustor Redlegged earth mite Black sand mite Penthaleus major Winter grain mite Blue oat mitePYEMOTIDAE Siteroptes cerealium TARSONEMIDAE Steneotarsonemus pallidus Cyclamen mite TENUIPALPIDAE Brevipalpus californicus California citrus mite Brevipalpus obovatus Brevipalpus lewisi Flat mite Tenuipalpes granati Tenuipalpes pac if icus TETRANYCHIDAE Bryobia arborea Brown mite Bryobia rubrioculus Eotetranychus coryli Eotetranychus lewisi Lewis spider mite Eotetranychus sexmaculatus Six spotted spider mite Eotetranychus weldoni Weldon s mite Eotetranychus willametti Eutetranychus banksi Texas citrus mite Mediolata mali Apple mite Oligonychus ilicis Southern red mite Oligonychus pratensis Timothy mite, Banks grass mite Oligonychus ununguis Spruce tree spider mite Panonychus citri Citrus red mite Panonychus ulmi European red mite Paratetranychus modestus Corn mite Paratetranychus pratensis Date mite Paratetranychus viridis Green mite Petrobia decepta Barley mite Schizotetranychus celarius Bamboo mite Schizotetranychus pratensis Alfalfa mite Tetranychus canadensis Four spotted mite Tetranychus cinnabarinus Tetranychus mcdanieli McDaniel mite Tetranychus pacificus Pacific mite Tetranychus schoenei Schoene mite Tetranychus telarius Common red spider Tetranychus urticae Two spotted spider mite Tetranychus turkestani Strawberry mite Tetranychus desertorum Desert mite The diphenylamines of formula I are usually formulated with one or more non phytotoxic carriers or adjuvants such as water, organic solvents, surfactants, inert finely divided solids, propellants as in an aerosol , stickers which will insure adherence of a treating formulation to foliage, and the like. The use of a surfactant is generally preferred. Such formulations will generally contain from 0.1 to 95 of the diphenylamine. The diphenylamine derivatives of formula I are conveniently formulated as concentrated compositions which are diluted prior to application, for instance by the addition of water or other suitable diluent to make a dispersion, emulsion or the like.Typical concentrated formulations which are in the form of solids are wettable powders. Wettable powders comprise a finely divided intimate mixture of an inert carrier or excipient, a diphenylamine derivative, and a suitable surfactant. Commonly utilized inert carriers which are agronomically acceptable include the diatomaceous earths, the various clays such as attapulgite clays or kaolin clays, or silica. Surfactants generally are present in about 0.5 to about 15 percent by weight of the wettable powder, with the diphenylamine derivative preferably being present in about 10 to about 60 percent by weight.Any of several known surfactants can be employed in the wettable powder formulations, including any of the sulfonated lignins, the condensed naphthalenesulfonates, the alkylbenzenesulfonates, the alkyl sulfates, as well as the nonionic surfactants such as the ethylene oxide adducts of phenols. The wettable powders which are thus comprised generally are diluted with water or the like prior to application. Such formulation is then applied as a spray or the like by conventional sprayers and other agricultural chemical applicators. Another commonly utilized formulation type to be employed with the diphenylamine derivative are the emulsifiable concentrates. Such formulations are comprised of a diphenylamine admixed with a carrier such as a water immiscible organic solvent and an emulsifying agent, in an amount from 0.5 to 15 percent by weight of the emulsifiable concentrate. Water miscible cosolvents may be utilized in conjunction with the immiscible solvent to improve solubility of the diphenylamine. Commonly used solvents include toluene, xylene, chlorotoluene, benzene, methyl isobutyl ketone, cyclohexanone, naphtha and the like. Aqueous suspensions employing water as a diluent also are contemplated.Emulsifiers which can be employed include the common surfactants and blends of surfactants, for example the alkyl and aryl sulfonates, ethoxylated alkyl phenols, ethoxylated alkyl ethers, the nonoxynols, oxysorbics, allinols, allinates and other nonionic and anionic surfactants. The surfactant may comprise from 0.5 to 10 percent by weight of the suspension. Such emulsifiable concentrates, like the wettable powder formulations, are diluted prior to application, for instance by the addition of the appropriate amount of water to provide a mixture having the desired concentration of active ingredient. The actual amount of compound to be applied to loci of insects and mites is not critical and can readily be determined by those skilled in the art in view of the examples below. In general, concentrations of from 10 ppm to 5,000 ppm of compound are expected to provide good control. With many of the compounds, concentrations of from 100 to 1,500 ppm will suffice.For field crops such as soybeans and cotton, a suitable application rate for the two most preferred compounds defined below is about 0.5 to 1.5 lbs. acre, typically applied in 50 gallons per acre of spray formulation containing 1200 to 3600 ppm of compound. The locus to which a compound is applied can be any locus inhabited by a phytophagous insect or arachnid, for example, vegetable crops, fruit and.nut trees, grape vines, and ornamental plants. Inasmuch as many mite species are specific to a particular host, the foregoing list of mite species also provides exemplification of the wide range of settings in which the present compounds can be used. Because of the unique ability of mite eggs to resist toxicant action, repeated applications may be desirable to control newly emerged larvae, as is true of other known acaricides. As insecticides and arachnicides generally, and as acaricides in particular, certain of the present diphenylamines are preferred. Preferred compounds are those wherein R methyl or ethyl, and especially those wherein R methyl. Preferred substitution patterns on theEMI10.1 ring include 3 trifluoromethyl , 4 f luoro, 4 bromo, 4 chloro, 2,4 difluoro, 2 chloro 4 fluoro, and 2 bromo4 fluoro. The most preferred compounds appear to be N methyl 3 ltrifluoromethyl 2 ,4 dinitro 6 trifluoro methyl diphenylamine and N methyl 2, 4 difluoro 2 , 4 dinitro 6 trifluoromethyl diphenylamine, and of these two, especially the latter. The diphenylamines of the invention can be prepared by known means, see for example, U.S. PatentsSpecification No. 4,187,318. In general, the compounds are prepared by one of the following reaction routes I. Condensation followed by alkylationEMI11.1 The reaction between the aniline derivative and the halophenyl compound is a simple amination which can be carried out using techniques well known to those skilled in the art. An acid scavenger, such as an inorganic base, a tertiary amine or excess of the aniline derivative is needed in the reaction mixture.In general, the condensation is most conveniently ef fected using dimethylformamide as solvent, at a temperature of about 100C, and using sodium hydride as the acid scavenger. The NH product is then alkylated by generating the anion with a weak base, preferably sodium carbonate, followed by reaction with a suitable alkylating agent, preferably a dialkylsulphate such as dimethylsulphate or an alkyl halide such as methyl iodide. The temperature of the alkylation preferably lies in the range from 20 to 1200C. Suitable inert organic solvents for the alkylation include acetone, dimethylformamide and tetrahydrofuran.II. Halogenation of an N alkyldiphenylamine for compounds where one or more R is bromo or chloro EMI12.1 III. Nitration of an N alkyldiphenylamine where R2 is NO2 EMI13.1 IV. Condensation of a 2 desnitrochlorobenzene and anN alkylaniline, or an aniline with subsequent alkylation, followed by nitration of the 2 position for polyhalosubstituted compounds such as 2,4,6 trihalo , tetrahalo , and pentahalo substituted compounds EMI14.1 The following examples illustrate the preparation of the compounds to be employed in accordance with the present invention.EXAMPLE 1 4 FLUORO 2 ,4 DINITRO 6 TRIFLUORO METHYL DIPHENYLAMINE 4 Fluoroaniline 10.0 grams 0.09 mole was combined with 100 ml. of anhydrous ethanol. l Chloro2,4 dinitro 6 trifluoromethyl benzene 12.2 grams 0.045 mole was added to the resulting solution, and the resulting reaction mixture was refluxed overnight about 20 hours under nitrogen.

Mexican Bean Beetle Southern Armyworm Bountiful green beans were grown from seed to 4 to 6 day old plants. They were then sprayed with a formulation containing the test compound at 1000 ppm or lesser concentration the spraying was of both the tops and bottoms of the leaves, about 8 10 ml. per plant.The plants were then allowed to dry and the leaves removed. Some of the leaves were placed in 100 x 20 mm plastic ptri dishes containing second instar larvae ofMexican Bean Beetle Epilachna varivestis Mulsant, order Coleoptera, family Coccinellidae , two leaves approximately 6 sa. in. of leaf surface and five larvae per petri dish. Two replicates were carried out per treatment. A small pad of cellulose was added to each dish to help prevent the leaves from wilting. Other treated leaves were placed in 100 x 20 mm plastic petri dishes containing third instar larvae of Southern Armyworm Spodoptera eridania Cramer, order Lepidoptera, Family Noctuidae . A solvent control and an untreated control were also employed, as well as a reference standard for each species. For both species, mortality counts were made four days after the larvae were placed on the treated leaves, using the following scale Actual No. of dead larvae Rating 0 0 1 2 1 3 4 2 5 3 In some tests, the amount of feeding by the larvae was also rated, on the following scale Feeding Rating none 0 1 50 of leaves 1 50 99 of leaves 2 100 of leaves 3 Two spotted Spider Mite Young Blue hubbard squash plants were thinned to one cotyledon per plant and infested by placing on each cotyledon a bean leaf infested with two spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae Koch , Order Acarina, family Tetranychidae . The plants were held for a day, then sprayed to wetting with a formulation containing 1000 ppm or lesser concentration of the test compound, with one infested plant cotyledon per treatment.Mortality was determined four days after treatment, using the following rating scale Percent Dead Rating 0 0 1 50 1 51 99 2 100 3 Housefly A cage of about 100 houseflies Musca domestica Linne , Order Diptera, Family Muscidae was sprayed with 5 ml. of a formulation containing 1000 ppm or lesser concentration of the test compound. A knockdown count was made 2 hours later, after which the flies were supplied a 5 solution of sugar in water. A mortality count was made 24 hours after treatment.Both knockdown and mortality counts employed the same rating system employed in the two spotted spider mite test. An untreated control, a solvent control, and a reference standard were employed. Results of the foregoing tests were as set forth in the following table. For the Mexican BeanBeetle and Southern Armyworm species, each of the two replicates is reported separately. TABLE II MITE INSECT SCREEN Compound Two spotted of Appln.

Each compound to by tested was formulated by dissolving it in a iri mixture of acetone and anhydrous ethyl alcohol containing 23 grams bf Toximul R and 13 grams of Toximul S per liter of solvent. The testing procedure was as follows. Tenday old bean plants were trimmed until one stem with one leaf remained per plant, mite infested leaves were placed on the trimmed plants and the mites were allowed to transfer for one to three days generally two days .The infesting leaves were then removed and the newly infested plants were sprayed to the point of runoff with one of the test formulations and then maintained under favorable conditions. One to three days later generally two days later the degree of miticidal action was determined by counting the number of mites surviving in a total of eight microscope fields, about 6.28 sq. cm. of leaf area. Population counting was stopped as soon as 25 mites had been counted. Four replicates were conducted. The following table records the results as the mean of the four replicates. Not all of the compounds were evaluated at the same time, but a solvent control solvent concentration ranging from 4,000 ppm to 100,000 ppm was included with each set of evalua tions. Except where otherwise indicated, the mean solvent control number of mites was in each instance in excess of 25. Plant injury ratings were generally made, on the following scale 0 no injury 1 slight injury 2 moderate injury 3 severe injuryResults are reported in the following table.

This absence of phytotoxicity is surprising in view of the significant phytotoxicity of many diphenylamines of the prior art. These differences are illustrated by the following greenhouse evaluation for crop response of soybeans to various diphenylamines. Each compound was formulated in a small amount of 50 50 ethanol acetone and Tween 20, then diluted with water and separated into multiple formulations containing the respective compound at various concentrations. Because of preliminary indications of higher phytotoxicity of an N H diphenylamine in comparison with its corresponding N CH3 diphenylamine. seeExample 67 hereinabove , different concentrations were necessarily evaluated in an attempt to determine the highest concentration of the spray formulation free of phytotoxicity. Generally, N H compounds were evaluated at 125, 62.5 and 31.25 ppm, and N CH compounds, at 4000, 2000 and 1000 ppm. Where necessary, selected compounds were retested at lower concentrations. Treated plants were held and observed for leaf distortion and leaf necrosis. However, any other kind of apparent response was noted. Each formulation was sprayed ontoKent variety soybeans which were 21 days old two fullyexpended trifoliate leaves and a juvenile are present .There were two replicates per treatment, and each replicate consisted of two plants. Not all of the treatments were conducted at the same time, but each group of treatments included a solvent control and an untreated control. The results of this evaluation for phytotoxicity were as set forth in the following table.Blanks in the table indicate that the compound in question was not tested. All data on a single line represents tests conducted at the same time. Neither the solvent check nor the untreated check exhibited any phytotoxicity in any of the tests.
