# DETECTION OF FETAL DEATH

## Abstract
Systems and methods are provided for diagnosing the death of a fetus in utero. A first ECG signal from the fetus is detected. A second ECG signal from the mother simul taneously is detected. The two ECG signals are displayed on a common time base and compared to determine whether an ECG component originating with the fetus is present in the first ECG signal.
