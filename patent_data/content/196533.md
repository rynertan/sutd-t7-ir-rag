## Description
This invention concerns the use of specific active substances to promote the coagulation of blood sampled for examination and, more particularly, it relates to coagulants which are used for separating serum or plasma hereinafter referred to as serum from the whole blood for testing the serum in a shorter time and at a higher yield and for use in hemostasis With the increase in the number of blood specimens to be examined, various studies have been made and put to practical use for improving the efficiency of separating serum from blood. Since the serum is mostly examined in the blood test, it is desirable to separate the serum from the whole blood with no contaminations in a short time and at a high yield. For the purpose of separation, it has been recognized as effective to use a so called serum separating sealant of a high molecular substance for forming partitions such as silicones, or polyether resins and acryl resins as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4140631 having an intermediate specific gravity between the liquid serum portion and the solid corpuscular portion hereinafter referred to as a separating gel , as well as a blood coagulant in combination. With the reason as described above, means for promoting blood coagulation are used for attaining the separation of the serum from the whole blood in a short time at a high accuracy. As the agents to be used for promoting blood coagulation, there have been reported, for instance, finely powderous or fibrous silicate compounds such as kaolin, Celite, diatomaceous silica and glass fibers, fine powders of calcium compounds such as calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate, thrombin like substances derived from snake venoms, and polyphenols that can activate blood clotting factors to promote the coagulation. Further, there have been reported various methods of using these substances, for example, adding one or more of them into a blood to be separated, coating them to the inside wall of a serum separation test tube, coating or depositing them onto an appropriate carrier which is then placed in the test tube, or dispersing them in the separating gel. However, if the coagulant is dispersed into the separating gel, no satisfactory effect of promoting the coagulation can be obtained because of reduction in the contact between the coagulant and the blood and hemolysis may sometimes be caused during centrifugal separation of the blood. Coagulants derived from snake venoms involve problems in that they are effective only for a short period of time and are expensive as well. Other coagulants may also cause problems in that the coagulation time can not be shortened as expected, and impurities are introduced into the serum. The object of this invention is to overcome the foregoing problems in the prior art and provide a coagulant capable of promoting the blood coagulation without developing hemolysis and thereby rapidly separating the serum with no undesired effects on the measured values of various test parameters. The object of this invention has been achieved according to this invention with a compound consisting of a lignan skeleton having an oxygen containing side chains or rings, selected from d sesamin, ℓ sesamin, paulownin, d asarinin, dℓ asarinin, 2α paulownin, 6α paulownin pinoresinol, d eudesmin, ℓ pinoresinol ß D glucoside, ℓ pinoresinol, ℓ pinoresinol monomethyl ether ß D glucoside, epimagnolin, lirioresinol B, syringaresinol dℓ , liriorsinon B dimethyl ether, phillyrin, magnolin lirioresinol A, 2α, 6α d sesamin, d diaeudesmin, lirioresinol C dimethyl ether d diayangambin and sesamolin. The above mentioned compounds consisting of a lignan skeleton having oxygen containing side chains or oxygen containing rings are present in a fraction obtained from extracts from certain kinds of plants of umballiferas and aristolochiaceae. The coagulants used according to this invention may be added in the form of a powder or an aqueous suspension to a sample to be tested composed of a blood. Alternatively, the coagulants used according to this invention dissolved or dispersed into a suitable solvent or binder may be applied to the inside wall of a serum separation test tube, or they may be coated on carriers such as glass beads or glass fibers which are inactive to the blood and capable of supporting them and then placed in a test tube. The coagulants according to this invention can be used with sufficient effect as an active ingredient in an amount ranging from 0.01 to 50 mg, preferably, from 0.1 to 20 mg per 1 ml of the blood. Further, the effect of the coagulants according to this invention can be enhanced by the combined use with known blood coagulating substances such as powdered silica, kaolin, glass, or fibrous glass materials. The coagulants used according to this invention can accelerate the blood coagulation time and the progress in clot retraction, leave no fibrin in the serum and cause no hemolysis that is, contributing to the improvement in the yield of the serum and the accuracy in the clinical examination . Besides, the serum obtained by the treatment and separation with the coagulants of this invention gives no adverse effects on biochemical and immunochemical examination. This invention will be more fully described by way of the following examples. Hydrocotyle sibthorpioides was subjected to extraction to obtain an active fraction by the following procedures The whole of the dried grass of 600 g was subjected to extraction three times each with 3 liters of methanol, and then the extract was concentrated to make 100 ml of methanol extract. To the extract, an equal amount of water was added, which was divided thereby into soluble and insoluble parts. 16.5 g of the insoluble part was subjected to extraction with 1 liter of benzene and the benzene was evaporated to obtain 16 g of a benzene extract viscous substance and a residue. 16 g of the benzene extract was purified by column chromatography and it was found that the purified substance was composed of ℓ sesamin having a molecular weight of 354, melting point at 122 123 C and α 18 D 64.5 . Asiasarum sieboldi was subjected to extraction to obtain an active fraction by the following procedures 500 g of dried tubers of Asiasarum sieboldi were subjected to extraction three times each with 3 liters of methanol and then concentrated to obtain 34 g of methanol extract. 100 ml of 50 aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide were added and shaken, followed by extraction with 500 ml of ethyl ether. The extract was concentrated to obtain 35 g of ether extract, which was found to be an active fraction composed of ℓ asarinin and ℓ sesamin as the main ingredients based on the following analytical values. Sodium ethyl acetate NaCH COCH₃ .COOC₂H₅ in an amount of 20 g was added to 12 g of piperonyl chloride and the mixture thus obtained was heated to reflux in 300 ml of ethyl ether, followed by concentration to obtain ethyl piperonyl acetate. Then, 50 ml of 1 aqueous ammonia and 5 g of ammonium chloride powder were added to the resultant concentrate and the obtained mixture was heated to reflux, followed by concentration to obtain ethypiperonyl acetate. Then, 25 ml of 3 ethanol solution of sodium and 50 ml of 9 ether solution of iodine were added to the ethylpiperonyl acetate to obtain diethyl 2,3 bis 3,4 methylenedioxybenzoyl succinate. The succinate was refluxed in 70 ml of a 1.6 ether solution of lithium aluminum hydride to obtain 1,4 bis 3,4 methylene dioxyphenyl 2,3 bis hydroxymethyl 1,4 butandiol. Then, 7 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 50 ml of ethanol were added, stirred at room temperature and then refluxed. After being left at room temperature, it was found that the substance was the aimed at active substance, d sesamin, since it had a molecular weight of 354 and a melting point at 125 126 C. The active substance containing ℓ sesamin as the main ingredient obtained in Example 1 was dissolved by an amount of 50 mg in 10 ml of a 1 1 mixed solution of methylene chloride and chloroform, and the resulting solution was applied to the inside of a glass test tube a or a plastic test tube b for use a in blood test both a and b had 13 mm in inner diameter and 10 ml in volume , which had been filled with a serum separating gel, to a level from 30 to 35 mm from the top of the separating gel. Then, the solvent was completely evaporated in a drying oven to prepare a test tube on which the active substance was coated by an amount from 5 to 7 mg. After pouring 6 ml of fresh human blood into the test tube, the test tube was left in a thermostable chamber at a temperature of 20 C. Then, the blood coagulation time was determined as the time taken until the blood could flow no more if the test tube was slanted by 90 . Then, the serum separated by centrifugation at 1600 G x 5 min. on the separating gel was collected by decantation and the amount was measured. The degree of the hemolysis was judged with the naked eye based on the evaluation criteria shown in Table 2. The results are shown in Table 1.
