# PRODUCTION OF ESTERS

## Abstract
A process for the production of an ester comprises re acting an olefin with carbon monoxide, hydrogen and another ester at elevated temperature and pressure in the the presence of a catalyst comprising 1 a rhodium source, 2 a ruthenium source, and 3 cobalt or zinc iodide. The product ester com prises the acid group of the ester used as reactant esterified with a hydrocarbyl group derived from the olefin, hydrogen and carbon monoxide.
