# APPARATUS FOR ACTUATING RAMS ON A TRACK PRESS

## Abstract
Continuous link track as used on heavy duty machinery such as bulldozers is assembled and dismantled using a hydraulic press consisting of a plurality of rams all actuated by a common lever 1 . Each function of the press corres ponds to a particular set of ram movements as dictated by the lever 1 which configures a hydraulic circuit by means of two, three position, four port hydraulic valves 6 7 . A valve spool 6a and 7a on each hydraulic valve 6 and 7 is mechanically connected to the lever 1 via an assembly of linkages 20 which allows the lever 1 to move in two mutually orthogonal directions A B and X Y . Movement of the lever 1 in each direction governs the action of a corresponding hydraulic valve 6 or 7 .
