# REFASTENABLE TAPE CLOSURE FOR DISPOSABLE DIAPERS AND COMPOSITE TAPE FOR THE PREPARATION OF SUCH CLOSURES

## Abstract
Composite roll of tape especially suitable for making a refastenable tape closure for disposable diapers. The construc tion involves a pressure sensitive adhesive fastening tape that partially overlies a pressure sensitive adhesive target tape and also partially overlies a pressure sensitive adhesive release tape, adhesion to the target tape preferably substantially exceeding the adhesion to the release tape. In use, the target tape and the release tape bond permanently to opposite sides of one edge of the diaper, one end of the fastening tape being thereafter lifted free from the release tape and permanently adhered to the opposite edge of the diaper. The opposite end of the fastening tape can then be repeatedly removed and re adhered to the surface of the target tape.
