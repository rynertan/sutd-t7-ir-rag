## Description
ELECTRIC CABLES RID COMPOSITIONS FOR USE IN THEM This invention relates to fully filled telecommunication cables and compositions for use as a filling medium in then. These cables comprise a multiplicity of conductors each with individual insulation, grouped in any appropriate way and enclosed in a sheath, the interstices between the insulated conductors, and between them and the sheath, being filled with a waterproof filling medium. The function of the filling medium is to provide a dielectric medium, the properties of which remain at the required level even when water gains access to the interstices.Furthermore the filling medium must inhibit the passage of water along the interstices in the event that the sheath or a joint enclosure is damaged when the cable is exposed to wet conditions, for instance while buried in the ground. The insulation on the individual conductors of such cables is almost always of polyethylene or polypropylene including certain of their semicrystalline thermoplastic copolymers of low permittivity , and in many cases this material is used in cellular form. To be effective the filling medium must be hydrophobic and highly deformable throughout the temperature range experienced by telecommunication cables in service which can extend from 40 C to 80 C . It must also contact the insulation in such a way as to prevent passage of water between itself and the insulation.There are very few non volatile materials that satisfy these requirernents as asell as the other important requirements of low permittivity and low dielectric loss, but for cables operating at temperatures up to about 500C hydrocarbon oils gelled with waxes e.g.petroleum jellies or hydrocarbon oils gelled with other suitable gelling agents have been found to be suitable. It is however desirable to use fully filled cables in some circumstances at temperatures up to about 80 C for example when they are associated with and run alongside large power cables and in this case two difficulties arise. First, petroleum jelly shows a tendency to fill cells in the insulation to an extent that may be appreciable in a few months. This can result in partial loss of the medium from interstitial spaces in the cable leading to the development of longitudinal channels and the consequent impairnent of the waterproofness of the cable in addition, the displacement of air permittivity approximately 1.0 in the cellular insulation by the filling medium permittivity typically 2.3 will lead to changes in cable capacitance and hence transmission characteristics of the cable.Second, the viscosity of the medium decreases to the point at which it may flow along the interstices under the hydrostatic pressures that may occur in an installed cable, allowing the water to flow after it. In our European Patent Application 78300524.2,Publication number 0001713, we have described a filling medium, and cables incorporating it, in which both of these problems have been overcome. The filling media there described, however, in common with conventional petroleum jelly based filling compounds, adhere tenaciously to insulation and require repeated mechanical wiping away from the insulation to prepare individual insulated wires for jointing and terminating purposes. The present invention defines a filling medium which is less tacky and more easily removed from the insulation and is generally more convenient to handle. Other filling media that satisfy this desire are known, but these are particularly unsatisfactory in their cell filling characteristics, even at relatively low temperatures and it is the object of the present invention to provide a filling medium and cables incorporating it that satisfies the requirement of effectively inhibiting cell filling in conjunction with that of the improved handling characteristics and which can be formulated for use at temperatures up to about 80 C if required. The filling medium in accordance with the invention comprises by weight a 70 98 of a hydrocarbon base b 1 15 of a block copolymer which comprises at least one block tending to confer solubility in the base and at least one block tending to inhibit such solubility, the proportions of the blocks being such that the polymer shows a strong tendency to form a gel with the base and c 1 15 of a hydrocarbon material that is miscible with the medium at high temperatures but forms solid dispersed particles on cooling at a temperature not lower than 65 C the base a comprising i 0 95 of a mineral oil with or without wax, for example in the form of petroleum jelly and ii 5 100 of a hydrocarbon or hydrocarbon mixture whose molecules are substantially incapable of diffusing into polyethylene, polypropylene or other cellular insulating material at temperatures of up to 800C and, when mineral oil is present being soluble in it and having a low enough number average molecular weight to reduce significantly the osmotic pressure of the medium. In addition to the ingredients specified, the medium may include effective amounts of antioxidants and other stabilisers, including gel stabilisers. The mineral oil preferably has an aromatic content less than 15 or better not greater than 5 , ideally not greater than 2 . Typical materials meeting these requirements are White Technical Oils for example Puremor W0T45 sold by Burmah Castrol Industrial Limited. Oils of high aromatic content can significantly alter the solubility characteristics of certain block copolymers and can also degrade dielectric properties of the filling medium in soe cases. One preferred group of osmotic pressure reducing substances for use as ingredient ii of the base consists of liquid polybutenes, made essentially from iso butene, with number average molecular weights between 203 and 00, particularly those between 350 and 2500, and more particularly between 500 and 1500. Such materials are sold by BP Chemicals Limited, under the trade name Hyvis. As ue molecular weight of the polybutene increases, the solubility and gel forming ability of the block copolymer is impaired and the resulting composition tends to become more tacky. Another preferred group of osmotic pressure reducing substances for this purpose consists of low molecular weight hydrocarbon resins, particularly those, said to be derived largely from alpha methylstryrene, sold by Hercules Powder Company under the trade name Kristalex and having ring and ball softening points AST E28 between 20 and 120 C and more particularly between 60 and 100 C. The block copolymer b preferably forms 2 8 of the medium, and may be of various types, such as those designated ABA , ABAB , ABCBA , A B and AS n n At least when the oil has an aromatic content less than 15 , a preferred material for use as ingredient b is a block copolymer of the ABA type in which the centre block B is a random copolymer of ethylene and butylene with end blocks A formed by graft polymerisation of styrene on to the centre block, for example a commercial material with a styrene to ethylene butylene ratio of approximately 0.4, sold by Shell Chemicals Limited under the trade mark Kraton as Kraton G1650 or G1652. The high temperatures at which ingredient c is miscible with the medium must include a temperature at which the medium can be introduced into the cable. The iaaximutn level of this temperature will almost always be determined by the softening characteristics of the insulation of the cable in which the medium is to be used.For example, for the following co,nmonly usefl cellular instllating materials, the ingredient c must be miscible with the medium down to the temperature indicated at least medium density polyethylene 95 preferably 90 C high density polyethylene 105 preferably 100 C polypropylene 135 preferably 130 C For maximum versatility of use, it is preferable that this ingredient does not form solid dispersed particles until the temperature falls to at least 90 C, and preferably to 850C. Preferably there is at least 1.5 , and more especially 1.5 5 , of ingredient c . This ingredient is preferably a low molecular weight polyethylene with a ringand ball softening point ASTt5 E28 in the range 110 130 C. Suitable ethylene homopolymers are sold by AlliedChemical, for example grade AC 8 which has a ring andball softening point ASTIT E28 of 116 C and a viscosity Brookfield LVT at 1400C of 350 cP. A preferred gel stabiliser is the synthetic isopropylated phenyl orthophosphate sold by Ciba Geigy Limited under the trade mark Reofos as Reofos 95. Alternatives can be selected from among other phosphate esters, alkyl ether phosphates, di alkyl ether esters, di and poly alkylene oxy glycol diesters, alkyl alkyl ether diesters, alkyl ether monoesters and aromatic diesters. Conventional antioxidants can be used in appropriate amounts, a suitable example being 0.5 13 of of the material sold by Vulnax International Limited under tle trade mark Per nanax as Pernanax √ßSP. Other stabiliser additives, such as metal deactivators, flame retardants, can be added as appropriate.

Cretney, Cellular Polyethylene InsulatedFilled Communication Cable and its Increasing Use , 24th Wire Cable Symposium, 1975. The samples used in these tests were of copper wire, 0.5 mm in diameter, covered with 0.2 mm radial thickness of an expanded medium density polyethylene the polyethylene was supplied by BXL PlasticsLimited under the reference BXL pN 225 6 and the degree of expansion was 30 . Note that, because of thermal annealing effects, density increases below 1 do not imply any cell filling.2. Drop Point By Institute of Petroleum test IP31 66. 3.
