# Electrode with outer coating for effecting an electrolytic process and protective intermediate coating on a conductive base, and method of making same.

## Abstract
An electrode with an outer coating for effecting an electroly tic process is provided with a protective intermediate coating consisting of a conducting insoluble polymer network formed in situ on a titanium base and containing a small amount of finely dispersed platinum group metal catalyst. A method of manufacturing the electrode comprises apply ing to the titanium base several layers of a solution containing a polymer precursor and a platinum metal compound which are thermally converted to the protective polymer coating, on which the outer coating is formed, more particularly by electrodepositing manganese dioxide or lead dioxide. The polymeric intermediate coating serves to protect the titanium base from oxidation, and to more particularly provide stable electrode performance with economical use of precious metal.
