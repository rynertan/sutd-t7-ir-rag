# Exercise device.

## Abstract
An exercise device 1 comprising a base 2 , a support 4 for the axle 51 of a wheel 52 of a cycle 53 , which wheel 52 being drivable by manual exertion, a roller 26, 27 , bodies 33 for mounting the roller with respect to the support, holding means 21, 22, 23, 24 for locating said bodies 33 in selected rotated positions about a centre and for holding said bodies against rotation, axle means 28, 29 extending between said bodies 33 and the roller 26, 27 , said axle means 28, 29 being eccentric with respect to said centre whereby locating said bodies 33 , by said holding means 21, 22, 23, 24 in selected rotated positions will position said roller 26, 27 at selected distances from said support whereby frictional resistance against turning im parted to the wheel 52 by said roller 26, 27 may be selectably varied.
