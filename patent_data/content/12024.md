# Brake actuator fastener assembly.

## Abstract
A vehicular air disc brake of the wedge actuator type in which the wedge actuator is secured to the air motor by an annular fastener 42 which is snap locked in place in a blind bore 52 in the free end of the wedge actuator 28b and which acts to secure the free end of the piston rod 40 of the air motor to the wedge actuator in response to generally linear movement of the piston rod into the fastener. The fastener 42 is split at 50 to allow insertion into the blind bore 52 in the free end of the wedge actuator, and includes a plurality of finger portions 48 which together define a single helical thread disposed within the blind bore this single thread allows the threads on the air motor piston rod 40 to ratchet therepast upon insertion of the piston rod, allows the piston rod 40 to be threaded out of the fastener 42 for disassembly purposes, and. in the event of inadvertent backing out rotation of the piston rod, allows the piston rod 40 to reseat in the blind bottom 52f of the wedge actuator brake in response to the next actuation of the air motor.
