FIRE BARRIER MATERIAL This invention relates to fire barrier materials suitable for fire blankets and methods for making the same. Fire blankets have been made of various materials including asbestos, leather and textiles such for example as woven glass fibre fabrics. Leather is very effective, but expensive, and somewhat heavy, hampering deployment with a blanket of any size. Asbestos certainly does not itself bum, but has limited effectiveness as a fire barrier and in any event is itself a hazardous material. Textile fire blankets meet the need for flexibility drape and relative lightness of weight, and are not dangerous of themselves although glass fibre is an irritant but have not been really effective, especially against fiercer fires. Aside from glass, which of course, does not bum at all, there have in recent years been developed numerous fire retardant textile fibres, made by modifying standard fibres like polyester, polyamide and acrylic fibres by including substances such as phosphorus, halides and heavy metals such as zinc or by other means. Although these modified fibres are very effective at resisting burning and sometimes act synergistically to generate a smothering gas or vapour, nevertheless, no really effective fire blanket has yet been made from them that can reliably bring under control a fire such as a chip pan fire. The present invention provides an improved, textilebased fire barrier material suitable for a fire blanket which can for example readily extinguish a chip pan fire. The invention comprises a fire barrier material suitable for a fire blanket comprising a low permeability layer interposed between two textile layers. Cleariy a non permeable layer is entirely satisfactory, but it may be problematical to consolidate a non permeable layer with textile layers without perforating the same. We have found that the layers may be connected together, even if an intermediate non perforable layer is used, by a method involving perforation of the same, in such fashion that the permeability remains low for present purposes. The low permeability layer may comprise a layer of film. The textile layers may comprise needled fibre webs. Surprisingly, the layers can be connected together by needling across the low permeability layer even where this is a film without detracting from the performance of the material. Such connecting needling may be effected at an angled inclined to the surface of the material. The textile layers may comprise fire retardant fibre such for example as a fire retardant cross linked polyacrylate such as that sold under the trade name INIDEX by Courtaulds Plc. The low permeability layer may also comprise a fire retardant layer such for example as a fire retardant polyvinyl chloride sheet The invention also comprises a method for making a fire barrier material suitable for a fire blanket comprising interposing a low permeability layer between two textile layers and connecting the layers together. The method may comprise connecting said layers together by needling. A needled assembly, we have found, may, despite the needling, have a layer between the two textile layers which is of said low permeability as to constitute an effective fire barrier material. The layers may be connected together by needling at an angle inclined to the surface of the material, for example in a Fibrewoven loom. The invention also comprises a fire blanket made from the material of the invention. In tests, material and fire blankets made of it according to the invention have readily put out chip pan fires. It is believed that conventional textile fire blankets are relatively ineffective because, although a fire may be contained for a while, if there are hot, flammable vapours associated with the fire, they penetrate through the conventional blanket and reignite on the other side. Embodiments of fire barrier materials and blankets made from them as well as methods for making the same will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a diagrammatic cross section through a material according to the invention,Figure 2 is a plan view of a film layer of said fabric, which is about 1 10 square 2.5mm X 2.5mm , and Figure 3 is a diagrammatic illustration of a needling operation for making said material. The fire barrier material 11 illustrated in Figure 1 comprises outer layers 12 of needled, cross laid card web of a fire retardant fibre such as a fire retardant cross linked polyacrylate such as INIDEX of Courtaulds Plc. Between said outer layers 12 is a low permeability layer 13 of fire retardant polyvinyl chloride sheet The layers are needled together with about 1400 penetrations sq. in. about 230 sq. cm from each side about 2800 sq. in. or 480 sq. cm altogether . Other levels of needling will be found to give acceptable results. On separating the layers 12, 13 which is achieved only with some difficulty the p.v.c. sheet 13 can be seen to have been penetrated with needle holes 14 Figure 2 . It appears that the resulting permeability of this sheet 13 is still sufficiently low however, that the material as a whole constitutes an effective fire blanket possibly because needle holes are blocked by fibre plugs 15 passing from each of the outer layers into entanglement with fibres of the other on the opposite side of the layer 13. These plugs 15 are seen in Figure 1 to be inclined with respect to the surface of the material 11. This has been brought about by the method of needling in a Fiberwoven loom Figure 3 , which uses inclined barbed needles 17 penetrating the assembly of layers 12, 13 from both sides. Further fibre plugs 16 are the result of earlier tack bonding of the cross laid card web, and do not penetrate the layer 13. The loom 18 is fed from rolls of tack needled cross laid card web 19 and a roll 21 of p.v.c. sheet The finished product is rolled up as at 22. A typical weight for the finished product is 425 gIm2 with a thickness of 2.8mm. In air permeability trials carried out according to BritishStandard 5636 of 1978, conventional needle punched textile blanket material had air permeabilities in the range 35.7 to 45.2 cm31cm21s. A conventional glass fibre fire blanket had a permeability of 10.0 cm3 om2Is. A blanket constructed according to the invention had a permeability, however, as low as 5.8 cm3 cm2 s, and passes BS 6575 of 1985 iight duty which requires extinguishing a cooking oil fire that has been burning for 2 minutes and so the flames may have reached a temperature of about 700 C . The test also
