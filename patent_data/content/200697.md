## Description
The present invention relates to a method for removing and collecting fluorescent material from mercury vapour electric discharge lamps or like lamps, in which the ends of the lamp, together with associated contact elements are separated from the intermediate part of the lamp bulb and the mercury laden luminescent material is loosened from the inner surfaces of the intermediate bulb part with the aid of a stripping device arranged for insertion to said bulb part through one end thereof and in which the loosened luminescent material is collected with the aid of a suction device which creates an air stream through the intermediate bulb part. The invention also relates to an arrangement for removing and collecting luminescent material from mercury vapour electrical discharge lamps and like lamps, wherein the arrangement includes a stripping device which is effective in loosening the luminescent material from the inner wall surface of a bulb part and a suction device capable of being connected to one end of the lamp part in order to collect loosened luminescent material. Mercury is a necessary constituent of the fluorescent layer in mercury vapour discharge lamps. Consequently, extended or burned out lamps must be processed in a suitable manner, so that the fluorescent material has no harmful effect on surrounding fauna and flora. Originally, expended vapour discharge lamps were dumped in the countryside at convenient dumping locations, although this procedure is now normally forbidden by the authorities. Controlled storage within the vapour discharge lamp industry has also become troublesome, due to the large quantities of waste requiring handling and supervision. In accordance with one practical method proposed some years ago the expended or scrapped lamps are crushed into fragments, coated with luminescent material, and the fragments placed in a treatment vessel in which the mercury is recovered by distillation processes. This treatment is carried out batchwise in a sealed container, into which nitrogen gas is introduced, and the container heated and placed under vacuum, such as to vapourize the mercury, the vapourized mercury being removed from the container through a bottom outlet and condensed in a cooling trap. This method is described and illustrated in German Published Specification 2911994.6. However, alhough the mercury is separated very efficiently, the process involved is extremely slow, taking about 9 hours to complete for each batch of 120 l, which renders the method expensive and therewith difficult to introduce in all destruction plants or in other establishments requiring to treat or process scrapped vapour discharge lamps. A machine for removing fluorescent coatings from the inside of fluorescent tubes is disclosed in SU A 174781. This machine includes a round wire brush for the removement or loosening of said coatings. The removed material is sucked into openings provided in a hollow shaft and further out through a rubber hose to a suction apparatus. The machine will probably clean the bulbs rather effectively but at the price of a comparably complicated design and a time consuming method. The brush will soon be worn out and the rotating machinery needs couplings and other details which have to be maintained. Consequently, one object of the present invention is to provide a method and an arrangement for removing and collecting luminescent material from mercury vapour electric discharge lamps which are very efficient and easy to introduce in an automatic line for recovering luminescent material. A second object is to provide a more reliable, faster and simplified method and arrangement as compared to the prior art. Other objects of the invention and advantages afforded thereby will be evident from the following description. These objects and advantages are achieved by the method and arrangement according to the invention having the characterizing features set forth in the appended claims. The invention will now be described in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Mercury vapour electric discharge lamps received for treatment in destruction plants and like centres are normally expended or burnt out, but otherwise whole. The present invention is particularly aimed at the treatment of such lamps, and the various stages of an illustrative method according to the invention will now be described with reference to the schematic Figures 1 6. This method enables the bulb part 22 to be removed from the process prior to distillation, which means that ten times as much discharge lamp waste material can be treated in comparison with processes in which the bulbs are first crushed and then cleansed of their luminescent content. In order for the improved process to be equally as effective as the known processes, however, it is necessary to ensure that substantially all the luminescent powder present is removed from the bulb by suction in step d of the aforedescribed method, i.e. that this suction step is substantially 100 effective. This can be achieved with the stripping device according to the invention, which need only be moved forwards and backwards once in the bulb part 22 in order to fulfil the aforesaid requirement. As beforementioned, the illustrated stripping device 27 comprises a stripping head 29 carried on a rod 28, which is driven by a linear motor 32. The stripping head 29 has the configuration of a double cone presenting two conical surfaces 33,34 each departing from a mutually common circular waist section 35. The conical surfaces are inclined at an angle of 20 40 It will be understood that the invention is not limited to the described embodiment, and that modifications can be made within the scope of the following claims. For example, in certain cases the luminescent material can be re used or dumped, instead of being treated in a distillation plant.
