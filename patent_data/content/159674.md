# RESOLUTION OF RACEMIC DERIVATIVES OF 5 1 METHYL 5 METHYL THIOPYRROL 2 OYL 1,2 DIHYDRO 3H PYRROLOÃ›1,2 A PYRROLE 2 CARBOXYLIC ACID AND ANALOGS

## Abstract
Racemic mixture of derivatives of 5 1 methyl 5 methyl thiopyrrol 2 oyl 1,2 dihydro 3H pyrrolo 1,2 a pyrrole 2 carboxylic acid and analogs were resolved into pure l or d isomers via concomitant isomerization and functional crys tallization.
