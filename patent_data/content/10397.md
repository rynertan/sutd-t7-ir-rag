# Broadly tunable chromium doped beryllium aluminate lasers and operation thereof.

## Abstract
A high power, broadly wavelength tunable laser is pro vided which comprises as the laser medium particular single crystals of chromium doped beryllium aluminate Be Al₂O₄ Cr³ having the chrysoberyl structure, means for excit ing the laser medium and tuning means. The laser may be operated over a broad temperature range from cryogenic temperatures to elevated temperatures. Elevated tempera tures are preferred, however, since they result in higher laser gain. Emission is in a spectral range from red to infrared, and the laser is useful in the fields of defense, communications, isotope separation, photochemistry, etc.
