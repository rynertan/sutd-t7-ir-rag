# Anti sift carton.

## Abstract
A paperboard carton has an end structure arranged to prevent sifting out and escape of powdered contents. A first pair of opposed carton panels has opposite major flaps each filling substantially the entire carton end opening and a second pair of opposed panels has opposite minor flaps each of which is divided into first and second minor parts. In the closing sequence, the opposite first minor parts are folded over the carton end, one major flap is next folded over, the opposite second minor parts are folded over, and finally the other major flap is folded over all. One or more flaps may be embossed for better contact and glue is applied to seal the structure.
