# Method for mounting painted tines.

## Abstract
Method for applying painted teeth on the frame of an agricultural implement, in particular hay making device, the teeth being fixed to the stand by means of a fixing portion 5 forming one entirety with the teeth, which is clamped to the frame, whereby before fixing the teeth at least the portions of the fixing portion which get in contact with other parts have no paint.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. Method for applying painted teeth on the frame of an agricultural implement, in particular hay making device, the teeth being fixed to the stand by means of a fixing portion forming one entirety with the teeth, which is clamped to the frame, characterised in that before fixing the teeth at least the portions of the fixing portion which get in contact with other parts have no paint. 2. Method as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the coat of paint is brushed from the appropriate portions of the fixing portion after painting by means of steel wire brushes. 3. Method as claimed in claim 1, the fixing portion forming part of a spiral shaped winding element, characterised in that a steel wire brush is passed through the windings of the spiral shaped element for removing the coat of paint and simultaneously another ateel wire brush works on the outside of the fixing portion. 4. Method as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that during the painting of the teeth the fixing portion is covered by means of cover plates.

## Description
Method for mounting painted teeth. The invention relates to a method for mounting painted teeth on the frame of an agricultural implement, in particular hay making devices, the teeth being fixed to the frame by means of fixing portions forming one entirety with the teeth, which are clamped to the frame. With agricultural implements, in particular hay making devices, frequent use is made of teeth made of spring steel, which are clamped to a frame portion of the implement by means of fixing portions forming one entirety with the teeth. In operation such teeth are loaded with forces of varying magnitudes and alternating working directions. In practice now it became apparent that such teeth became loose after a comparatively short time, as a result of which the aimed activities could no longer be carried out with the implements concerned. Eventually it appeared that the hard coat of lacquer mostly applied to such teeth remained intact on fixing the teeth but crumbled off comparatively fast during the working of the machine which resulted in play on the spot where the teeth were fixed. According to the invention it is now effected that before fixing the teeth at least the portions of the fixing portion which get in contact with other parts have no coat of paint. Surprisingly it has become apparent that as a result of such a simple measure the defect of teeth becoming loose can be prevented. The invention will be further explained hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings. Fig. 1 shows in perspective a portion of the tooth with a fixing portion. Fig. 2 shows in part Xve a view corresponding with fig. 1, illustrating a possibility for reawsving the coat of lacquer. Fig. 3 shows a view corresponding with fig. 1, protecting elements being mounted on the fixing part to prevent paint from being applied to the fixing portion when the teeth are being painted. Fig. 1. shows the ends 1 and 2 of a pair of teeth, not further illustrated, of a hay making device or the like, said ends joining in the usual manner to coils 3 and 4 respectively, forming one entirety with the teeth, said coils being mutually connected by a U shaped bent portion 5 forming one entirety with said coils, said portion 5 usually being used for fixing the teeth to the frame. Said teeth with the coils 3 and 4 and fixing portions 5 are usually bent of spring steel wire. The fixing portion 5 is then clamped to a portion of the frame of the agricultural implement by means of a bolt and clamping plates. Usually the teeth are provided with a coat of paint, frequent use being made of a powder lacquer, which forms a very hard coat of paint.According to the invention it is now effected that before mounting the teeth the fixing portion 5, which will butt against frame portions, clamping plates or the like will have no paint, as is indicated with dots in fig.1. By effecting that at least the portion of the fixing portion 5 which touches the further portions has no paint, it is prevented that after mounting of the teeth on the frame such a coat of paint can crumble off and consequently may cause the teeth to become loose. Removing the coat of paint from the appropriate portions of the fixing portion can be carried out after the painting of the teeth in the manner illustrated in fig. 2, use being made of a pair of circular steel wire brushes 6 and 7, which are fixed to the ends of to be driven axes 8 and 9, said axes extending parallel to each other. Then the steel wire brush 6 is passed through the inside of the spiral shaped coils 3 or 4 for removing the coat of paint from the inside of the fixing portion 5, whilst steel wire brush 7 works on the outside of the fixing portion. Another possibility is, as illustrated in fig.3, to mount cover plates 10 and 11, located on both sides of the fixing portion, to said fixing portion before painting. Said cover plates may be clamped to the fixing portion by means of a bolt not further illustrated. It will be apparent, that the mounting of said cover plates 10 and 11 prevents paint from being applied to portions of the fixing portion 5 coveredby saidplates.
