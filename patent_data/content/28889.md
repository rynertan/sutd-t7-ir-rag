# A transformer rectifier system.

## Abstract
A three phase rectifiar transformer for converting three phase AC into DC, has a delta connected primary and two identical secondary windings per phase, the total of six sec ondary windings being connected in hexagon symmetrical taps are provided on each secondary winding and connected to rectifying devices for generating DC energy from a first group of six symmetrical AC voltages at 60 with respect to an imaginary neutral for one polarity and from a second group of six symmetrical AC voltages at 60 with respect to the imagi nary neutral for the other polarity, the first and second groups being at 30 phase shift to each another. The arrangement results in a smaller overall transformer size, and well matched reactances and very little of abnormal harmonics.
