# Device for the treatment of hat shaped closures, especially for cleansing of such closures.

## Abstract
A closure treatment machine having one or more caskets 1 for holding the closures 9 said caskets comprise a number of parallel bars 2, 3, 4 , which are connected at both ends to each other by coupling plates 5, 6 , whereby the parallel bars are arranged in such a way that the closures are held between said bars but still do have such a tolerance, that the cleansing liquid sprayed from nozzles 23 towards the closures may reach any side of the closures. For filling and emptying the caskets at least one of the coupling plates has an opening 7, 8 for passing the closures. The caskets which are moved by means of chains 16 may be led after a cleansing station to a drying station or a sterilization station.
