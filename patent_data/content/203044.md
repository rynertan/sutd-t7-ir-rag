# A MOVABLE WALL PRE COMBUSTION CHAMBER FOR TWO STROKE OR FOUR STROKE DIESEL ENGINES

## Abstract
A pre combustion chamber for two stroke or four stroke diesel engines, said chamber consisting of a pre combustion chamber 14 arranged partially inside the combustion chamber 15 , the pre combustion chamber 14 being open at its lower part, as well as of a movable bottom wall 10 which is made up of the top part of the piston 9 , both said pre combustion chamber 14 and said movable wall 10 being shaped so that, at the Top Dead Center of the piston stroke, they couple without contacting each other, so as a gap is left for allowing the air to pass from the combustion chamber 15 to the precombustion chamber 14 .
