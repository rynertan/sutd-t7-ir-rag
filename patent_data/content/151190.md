## Abstract
A rigid frame 60 encloses and protects a passenger compartment in between front and rear rigid axle assemblies 51, 54 . At each end of the frame is a pair of widely spaced apart, substantially parallel struts 221,222,231,232 . These are on opposite sides of and parallel to the vehicle s longitudinal axis, extending between a transverse frame member 64 67 and the respective axle 51,54 assembly and connected at each end by a universal loint. There is also at each end of the frame a pair of converging struts 241,242,251,252 that connect a transverse frame member to an axle 51,54 assembly by a universal joint 244,245 at each end of each strut these struts are wide apart at one end and close to each other at the other end. A vertically mounted combination spring 262 264 and shock absorber is interposed between and bears against the frame and each axle 51,54 on each side of the longitudinal axis.
