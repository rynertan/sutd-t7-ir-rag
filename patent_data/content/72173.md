# Novel complexes, coating and adhesive compositions, and methods.

## Abstract
Complexes which are the reaction product of a metal salt, an organofunctional silane and water are described which are useful in chemically curing and non chemically curing coating and adhesive compositions. Employment of the complexes in such compositions reduces the adhesion loss often encoun tered when metal substrates to which compositions have been applied are exposed to water or water vapor. Also described are coating and adhesive compositions to which the metal salt and the organofunctional silane have been added as separate components. These compositions also exhibit reduced adhe sion loss when exposed to water or water vapor.

## Description
NOVEL COMPLEXES, COATING AND ADHESIVE COMPOSITIONS, AND METHODS Background of the Invention The present invention relates to a complex which is the reaction product of a metal salt, an organofunctional silane, and water. This invention further relates to compositions which exhibit improved adhesion to substrates in the presence of water or water vapor as the result of inclusion therein of either a metal salt and an organo functional silane or a complex which is the reaction product oE a Inctal salt, an organo functional silane and water. Methods of reducing the adhesion loss suffered by compositions when exposed to water or water vapor are also discussed. It is known that coating and adhesive compositions, once cured, may suffer from adhesion loss when exposed to water or water vapor. While numerous adhesion promoters such as amino functional trialkoxysilanes have been employed in compositions to improve their adhesion to, for example, metal substrates, conventional adhesion promoters often do not suitably decrease the adhesion loss suffered by compositions when exposed to water or water vapor. Complexes of a metal salt and an amino functional silane are known in the art to be useful antistatic agents, e.g., see U.S. patent No. 3,418,094.However, it has not heretobefore been proposed to employ complexes of a metal salt and an organo functional silane in coating or adhesive compositions in order to reduce the adhesion loss suffered by such compositions when exposed to water or water vapor. Summary of the Present Invention The present invention provides novel complexes which are the reaction products of a metal salt, an organo functional silane, and water, which complexes are useful in reducing the adhesion loss typically suffered by coating and adhesive compositions when exposed to water or water vapor. The present invention also provides novel coating and adhesive compositions which comprise complexes which are the reaction product of a metal salt, an organic functional silane, and water. rrhe present invention further provides novel methods for reducing the adhesion loss suffered by coating and adhesive compositions when exposed to water or water vapor.More particularly, the complexes which reduce adhesion loss exhibited by coating and adhesive compositions in the presence of water or water vapor are the reaction product of a metal salt, a silane of the formula Y Si X 3 wherein X is selected from the group consisting of i radicals of the formula OR1, R1 being a monovalent hydrocarbon group of 1 to 10 carbons ii radicals of the formulaEMI2.1 R2 being selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and monovalent hydrocarbon groups of 1 to 10 carbons and iii halogen atom radicals and may be the same or different in the same silane and Y is selected from the group consisting of unsub stituted and substituted hydrocarbon groups of 1 to 10 carbons and water. The present invention also provides coating and adhesive compositions which exhibit improved resistance to adhesion loss as the result of inclusion therein of a metal salt and a silane as separate components. The present invention provides a diverse group of coating and adhesive compositions which exhibit improved resistance to adhesion loss which generally results from exposure of the composition to water or water vapor. For example, epoxy, urethane, unsaturated and saturated polyesters, polyacrylate, nitrile phenolic and polyvinylchloride compositions exhibiting improved adhesion are all described herein. The coating and adhesive compositions may be one part or two part compositions. The coating and adhesive compositions described herein exhibit improved resistance to adhesion loss when employed on a variety of metal substrates e.g., steel and aluminum . Detailed Description of the Invention The complexes useful in the practice of the present invention are the reaction product of a metal salt, a silane of the formula Y Si X 3 wherein X is selected from the group consisting of i radicals of the formula .OR1, R1 being a monovalent hydrocarbon group of 1 to 10 carbons ii radicals of the formulaEMI3.1 R2 being selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and monovalent hydrocarbon groups of 1 to 10 carbons and iii halogen atom radicals and may be the same or different in the same silane and Y i s selected Eroin tilc group consisting of unsub stituted or substituted hydrocarbon groups of 1 to 10 I r s and water. The metal salts useful in the practice of the present invention may comprise as cations the metals disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,418,094. Preferred metals for. use in preparing the metal salt are titanium, Iflanganese, copper, zinc, magnesium, aluminum and bismuth.The most preferred metal is iron. The metal salts may comprise any anion which results in a water soluble complex. Suitable metal salts include metal chlorides, bromides, iodides, nitrites, sulfites and perchlorates. Preferred metal salts are mental nitrates, metal basic diacetates and metal ammonium dioxalates. The most preferred metal salts ara metal chlorides. Examples of suitable metal salts are Fe OH O2CCH3 2, Fe NH4 3 O4C2 3, Fe NO3 3, FePO4, MgC12, AlC13, BiC13, TiC13, MnC12, FeC12, CoC12, and ZnC12. The preferred metal salt in the practice of the present invention is FeC13. The silanes useful in the practice of the present invention are of the above indicated formula. As indicated above, X may be a variety of types of radicals. While not wishing to be bound to any particular theory, it is believed that the only restriction on the type of radical which X may be is that X should be hydrolyzable under reaction conditions such as those described hereinbelow. Preferred silanes in the practice of the present invention comprise, as X, methoxy, ethoxy, acetoxy and or chloro radicals. Preferred silan in the yr lctiici oE tulle present invention comprise only one type of radical within a given silane. The nature of Y is not believed to be critical to the practice of the present invention. Thus, Y may be an unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon group which may or may not be substituted. Examples of suitable substituted hydrocarbon groups include methacryloxy functional, epoxy functional, mercapto functional, amino functional, and ureido functional hydrocarbon groups. Particular examples of suitable silanes are simple alkyl functional silanes such as ethyl triethoxy silane vinyl functional silanes such as vinyl triethoxysilane, vinyl trichlorosilane, vinyl tris beta ltl thoxy etoxy silane and vinyl triacetoxysilane e.g., those commercially available under the trade designations A l5l , A 150 , A 172 and A 188 , respectively, from UnionCarbide Corporation gamma methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane e.g., that commercially available under the trade designation A 174 from Union Carbide Corporation epoxy unctional silanes such as gamma glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane and beta 3,4 epoxy cyclohexyl ethyltrimethoxysilane e.g., those commercially available under the trade designations A 187 and A 186 , respectively, fromUnion Carbide Corporation mercapto functional silanes such as gamma mercapto propyl triethoxysilane e.g., that available under the trade designation A 189 from UnionCarbide Corporation amino functional silanes such as gamma aminopropyltriethoxysilane, N beta aminoethyl gamma arninopropyltrimethoxysilane, N bis beta hydroxyethyl gammaamino propyltriethoxysilane, and H2NCH2CH2NHCH2CH2NHCH2CH2CH2Si OCH3 3 e.g., those commercially available under the trade designations A 1100 , A 1120 , A llll , and A 1130 , respectively, from Union Carbide Corporation and ureido functional silanes such asEMI5.1 e.g., that commercially available under the trade designation A ll60 from Union Carbide Corporation . The complexes are generally prepared by adding water dropwise to a heated mixture which comprises a metal salt, a silane and a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide or acetone. A base such as sodium hydroxide may also be added to the mixture in some instances to neutralize excess acidity. It has been found in the present invention that varyil the relative amounts of the metal salt, the silane and the water employed to prepare the complexes described herein can significantly affect the properties of the product thereby obtained. In particular, it has been found that suitable complexes may be prepared using rom about 0.25 to 2 moles of the metal salt for every mole of the silane employed. As to the amount of water employed, it is believed that complete or nearly complete hydrolysis of the silane group of the silane results in complexes exhibiting superior properties. Preferably about 2 to 6 moles of water and most preferably 3 to 4 moles of water will be employed for every mole of the silane employed.While the hydrated metal salt may be employed in preparing the complex, it is preferred that the anhydrous metal salt be employed. A variety of types of chemically curing coating and adhesive compositions i.e., those requiring the presence of a curative for cure exhibit improved adhesion to substrates in the presence of water or water vapor as the result of inclusion of the complexes in those compositions. For example, one part and two part coating and adhesive compositions comprising an epoxide, urethane, or unsaturated polyester as the curable organic resin compound all exhibit improved resistance to adhesion loss when they further comprise a complex of the type described hereinabove. One part and two part epoxy coating and adhesive compositions in which the complexes are useful in improving adhesion to substrates are well known in the art and comprise the many types of epoxy resins and curatives which have been described in the art. Examples of particular types of epoxy compositions in which these complexes may be suitably employed are described in U.S. Patent Nos.2,847,395, 3,386,955, and 3,553,166. Preferred curatives for epoxy coating and adhesive compositions are conventional dihydrazide curatives. One part and two part urethane coating and adhesive compositions in which these complexes may be suitably employed are also well known in the art and include those described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,272,098 and 3,723,163. Suitable unsaturated polyester containing coating and adhesive compositions in which these complexes may be employed are well known in the art and include those described, for example, on pages 286 293 of PreparativeMethods of Polymer Chemistry , authored by W. R. Sorenson and T. W. Campbell and published by IntersciencePublication, New York 1961 . The complexes described hereinabove are also useful in improving the adhesion of nonchemica2ly curing coating compositions i.e., those not requiring the presence of a curative for cure, but which form a coating, for example, upon evaporation of a solvent . Examples of suitable organic resin compounds for employment in such coatings are well known in the art and include, for example, such resins as vinyl polymers and copolymers, polyurethanes, synthetic elastomers, alkyd resins, polyacrylates, polymethacrylates and nitrile phenolics.Other suitable organic resin compounds for use in nonchemically curing coating compositions are disclosed in U.S.Patent No. 3,418,094 Marsden et al. . The chemically curing and nonchemically curing coating and adhesive compositions described hereinabove preferably comprise about 0.2 to 5 parts by weight and most preferably 0.5.to 2 parts by weight of the complexes per 100 parts by weight of the total amount of the organic resin compound employed. While it is preferred that the preformed complex which is the reaction product of a metal salt, a silane, 1 1 1 i 1 W X O L I, J l l t S vi ive position, it has been found in the present invention that coating and adhesive compositions such as those described herein to which the metal salt and silane have been added as separate components also exhibit improved resistance to the adhesion loss which generally results from exposure to water or water vapor. Preferably the metal salt and silne are each added to a coating or adhesive composition in tie amount of about 0.1 to 8 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the total amount of the organic resin compound present in the compositino. The metal salt employed may either be anhydrous or hydrated. The following non limiting examples will illustrate the practice of the invention. Unless otherwise indicated, all parts, proportions and percentages are by weight.

The resulting solution was heated to about 700C. A mixture of 2.2 grams of water 0.12 moles and 10 grams of dimethyl formamide was then added dropwise with constant stirring of the solution.Heating of the solution was continued for an additional two hours after the water dimethyl formamide mixture had been added. Thereafter, solvent was removed from the solution by means of vacuum roto evaporaticn to yield a reddish brown liquid which transformed into a dark reddish brown, brittle resinous material upon drying overnight in a vacuum oven maintained at 500C.

In testing the performance of each epoxy composition, a 125 10 micrometer coating of a composition was applied to a 20 gauge, 10 cm x 20 cm cold rolled steel panel by means of a Meyer bar. The steel panel had previously been wiped with methyl ethyl ketone. Each coated panel was thereafter cured at 1770C for 45 minutes and then allowed to condition overnight at room temperature. Subsequently, each coated panel was immersed in a water bath maintained at 750C. The coated panels were periodically removed from the bath and subjected to testing in accordance with the ASTM Methods Test entitled Measuring Adhesion by Tape Test Designation D 3359 74 . The time to one hundred percent loss of adhesion was determined. Results of the testing of the various foregoing compositions appear in Table 1 below.
