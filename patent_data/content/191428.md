## Description
An inspection door for a flagged covering or casing The invention relates to an inspection door for closing an inspection opening provided in a flagged covering or casing, said door including a flat removable cover plate made from sheet steel and adapted to be covered with flags, and a frame adapted to be flagged and carrying permanent magnets for supporting said cover plate. An inspection door of this kind is known fromDE A 27 56 124. Such known inspection door has the frame made of profile bars each having one profile leg to be flagged and another profile leg projecting into the gap between the flags of the flagged cover plate and the flagging surrounding the inspection opening, and said frame has off set sheet stripes projecting into the frame opening and carrying said permanent magnets which are in the form of cylindrical magnets having external threads and being screwed into associated tab holes of said off set sheet stripes. Every paviour knows the difficulties in mounting such or similar inspection doors so as to achieve a properly flush closure of the inspection opening with the flags of the inspection door being properly integrated into the gap pattern of the surrounding flagging. However, this is difficult with the just mentioned prior art inspection door and with other commercial inspection doors as well.The profile legs projecting into the gap between the inspection door and the surrounding flagging reduces the possible extent of correction of the flags covering the cover plate, on the one hand, and requires to provide gaps of excessive width in the region of the inspection door, on the other hand, and, furthermore, the proper adjustment of the position of the four magnets will often be achieved only after multiple sequences of trial and troublesome removal of the cover plate failing to take a properly flush position. Despite of this, manufacturing of said prior art inspection door is expensive and requires numerous parts, and proper mounting is time consuming and difficult. Therefore, it is the object of the present invention to provide an inspection door of the kind in question so as to allow for quick and easy mounting independently of the thickness of the flags and to be convenient and inexpensive in respect to manufacture, and so as to form, when mounted, an unconspicuous closure of an inspection opening, which closure being properly integrated into the gap pattern of the surrounding flagging and allowing to be opened, when necessary, but which otherwise cannot be easily recognized and allows for an air and water tight closure of the inspection opening. In view of this object, the invention resides in an inspection door for closing an inspection opening provided in a flagged covering or casing, said door including a flat removable cover plate made from sheet steel and adapted to be covered with flags, and a frame adapted to be flagged and carrying permanent magnets for supporting said cover plate, characterized in that said frame has a plane front surface and is made as a sheet construction of sheet material having the same thickness as said cover plate and consisting of at least two sheet stripes arranged at two opposite edges of said cover plate, and in that said magnets are mounted so as to support said cover plate flush with the plane front surface of said frame. The inspection door according to the invention lends itself especially for use in laying flags in a thin layer of cement and, because of its easy mounting, is cut out specifically for do it yourself workers who can make a proper flagging without specific technical knowledge and without special mechanical skill. The inspection door according to the invention has the frame and the cover plate lying in a common plane, that is flush with each other so that mounting is performed simply by inserting the frame in the region of the edges of the inspection opening flush with the substrate to be flagged, and the frame and the cover plate can then be covered with flags, whereby a flush position of the flagged cover plate with the surrounding flagging can be achieved without any special adjustment and totally independently of the respective thickness of the flags.Due to the absence of any webs of the frame projecting into the gap between the cover plate and the surrounding flagging, the cover plate together with its flagging can be properly integrated into the flag pattern, and permanently elastic gap filler can then be injected into the gap and, when the inspection door needs to be opened, can be scraped out and renewed thereafter. Thus, the mounted inspection door is air and water tight. The inspection door according to the invention can be manufactured in a very easy and inexpensive manner because, except for the magnets and, if need be, their mountings attached to the backside of the frame, it consists only of flat sheet material. The frame can consist of two sheet stripes to be mounted at opposite sides of the inspection opening, said two stripes being rigidly connected to each other by two transverse bars attached to their backsides. This allows for easy manufacture of the frame without punching out any large opening and, simultaneously, allows for easy mounting of the inspection door. Alternatively, the frame can be formed by a sheet plate having a central opening corresponding to the size of said cover plate. In case of large piece numbers, this alternative constitutes the best method of manufacture and results in a frame construction which is rigid in itself. Preferably, said magnets each are attached to the backside of the frame in such a manner that their support surfaces for said cover plate are flush with the backside of the frame and project beyond the inner edges of the frame into the frame opening. Said magnets can be made as flat magnets, each of them being attached with one edge thereof to the backside of the frame, or being arranged diagonally at one corner of said frame opening. Preferably, said magnets are attached to the backside of the frame by adhesive. Alternatively, each of said magnets can be mounted in a recess of a bar or of a lug attached to the backside of said frame and crossing said frame opening or extending into said frame opening. Each of said magnets can be adjustably mounted in a tab hole of said bar or lug. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, two opposite sheet stripes of said frame have their edge portions adjacent to said frame opening off set backwards by the amount of the sheet thickness so as to form additional support surfaces for said cover plate, said additional support surfaces extending substantially along the full length of the respective two opposite edges of the cover plate, thus rendering installation of the inspection door even more easy and improving proper and flush support of the cover plate. In this embodiment, the magnets can be mounted in recesses of said off set edge portions. Some examples of embodiments of the invention are shown in the accompanying drawings and are described hereinafter in more detail. In the drawings, fig. 1 is a cross sectional view of an inspection door according to the invention mounted in a flagged covering, fig. 2 is a top view of an embodiment of an inspection door according to the invention, fig. 3 is a top view of an alternative embodiment of an inspection door according to the invention, figs. 4, 5 and 6 are top views of the frame of the inspection door with various alteratives of mounting the magnets, and fig. 7 a further embodiment of an inspection door according to the invention. Fig. 1 shows an inspection door 3 constructed according to the invention and mounted at a flagged wall across an inspection opening 2, the inspection door consisting of a frame 4, of permanent magnets 5 attached thereto, and of a cover plate 3. Frame 4 is, using a bed of mortar 7 for instance, mounted into wall 1 at the border of inspection opening 2 flush with wall surface 1a to be flagged. Permanent magnets 5 in the form of flat magnet bodies each have its edge portion attached to the backside of the frame, by means of adhesive for example, and they project beyond the inner edges of the frame into the inspection opening, each magnets support surface 5a for supporting the cover plate 6 being flush with the backside ofthe france.Frame 4 and cover plate 6 are both made from sheet steel of the same thickness, thus rendering the front surfaces of frame 4 and cover plate 6 flush with each other and also with outer wall surface la when cover plate 6 is inserted. After flagging with a thin layer of cement 8, flags 9 attached to the wall around inspection opening 2 and flags 10 attached to cover plate 6 ly flush with each other. The gaps between flags 10 of the cover plate and the surrounding flags 9 have a permanently elastic gap filler 11 injected therein which, when the inspection door needs to be opened, will be scraped out and renewed thereafter.Opening of the inspection door can easily be performed using a suction apparatus as known per se. Fig. 2 shows a top view of the inspection door according to fig. 1 in a smaller scale, wherein the flagging is indicated in dotted lines only.
