# Purfication of liquid paraffins.

## Abstract
Aromatic hydrocarbon impurities are removed from a liquid paraffin by contacting the liquid paraffin at relatively low temperatures less than 120 C with an X type zeolite molecular sieve material. The contacting is performed without recycling and purified liquid paraffin containing less than about 0.01 by weight aromatics may be obtained.
