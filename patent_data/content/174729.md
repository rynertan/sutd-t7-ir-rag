# Optical amplification.

## Abstract
Light is amplified in a semiconductor laser structure through which a current is passed and a the wavelength of the light is greater than the wavelength of maximum gain of the laser structure, or b injection locking is avoided, or c the current is controlled so as at least partly to compensate for the decrease in the monitored light output at a wavelength or over a wavelength range distinct from that of the emitted amplified signal. In this way relatively high input powers can be amplified.
