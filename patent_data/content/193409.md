# Integrated digital circuit for processing speech signal.

## Abstract
In an integrated circuit 10 for transcoder, a subtractor 28 generates a signal representing a difference between an input speech signal Di and a prediction signal Sf . This signal is transferred to a quantizing unit 30 . The unit 30 quantizes an output signal from the subtractor 28 , and generates a predictive encoded signal S1 . An inverse quantizing unit 42 generates a difference signal S2 . A predictor filter 46 generates the prediction signal Sf to be supplied to the subtractor 28 . A signal path changing unit made up of electronic switches 26, 32, 34, 36, 38 responds to a mode select signal M1, M2 to suitably change an electric connection among the subtractor 28 , the quantizing unit 30 and the reverse quantizing unit 42 , whereby the integrataed circuit device can function as an ADPCM encoder or an ADPCM decoder.
