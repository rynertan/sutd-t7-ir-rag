# Process and intermediates for preparation of 1,1 dioxopenicillanoyloxymethyl 6 beta aminopenicillanate.

## Abstract
A process for the preparation of 1,1 dioxo penicillanoyloxymethyl 6 beta aminopenicillanate which comprises reacting 1,1 dioxopenicillanoyloxymethyl 6 phenylacetamidopenicillante or the corresponding phenoxy acetamidopenicillanate under anhydrous conditions with a halogenating agent in the presence of a reaction inert solvent to form an intermediate imino halide, addition of a primary alcohol having from one to four carbon atoms to convert the imino halide to an imino ether and subsequent hydrolysis to give the desired product.
