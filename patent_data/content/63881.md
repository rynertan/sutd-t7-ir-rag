# Poly ester amide derived from p hydroxybenzoic acid, 2,6 naphthalene dicarboxylic acid and aromatic monomer capable of forming an amide linkage.

## Abstract
A melt processable poly ester amide which is ca pable of forming an anisotropic melt phase is provided. The poly ester amide of the present invention consists essentially of the recurring units a p oxybenzoyl moi ety, b 2,6 dicarboxynaphthalene moiety, c aromatic moiety capable of forming an amide linkage in the polymer, and, optionally, d p dioxyphenyl moiety and e other carbocyclic dicarboxyl moiety, in the propor tions indicated. Preferably, the aromatic moiety capable of forming an amide linkage is derived from p amino phenol or p phenylene diamine. The carbocyclic dicar boxyl moiety is preferably aromatic. The resulting poly ester amide exhibits a melting temperature below ap proximately 400 C, preferably below approximately 350 C. The poly ester amide of the present invention is preferably formed by a melt polymerization technique.
