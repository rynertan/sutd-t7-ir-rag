# Optical fiber alignment mechanism and connectors using the same.

## Abstract
Optical fiber alignment mechanism comprising at least an optical fiber 20 , at least three rigid members with a circular cross section, which are arranged to surround said optical fiber 20 and of which each is in tangential contact with said optical fiber 20 as well as with two other rigid members, and a plastic member molded in a plug like sha pe to contain said fiber 20 and rigid members in lump, the outer surface of said plastic member allowing said rigid members to be exposed tangentially at least at three por tions thereon.
