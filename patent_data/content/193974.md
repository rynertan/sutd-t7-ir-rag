## Description
A CATALYST FOR ISOMERIZATION REACTION The present invention relates to a useful fixed catalyst for the isomerization reaction from quadricyclanes to norbornadienes. The so called conversion system from light energy to heat energy in which norbornadienes such as norbornadiene and its derivatives are isomerized into the corresponding quadricyclanes by irradiation with light first isomerization , the resulting quadricyclanes are converted to the original norbornadienes by isomerization in the presence of a catalyst second isomerization , and heat generated on said second isomerization is taken out, is well known by Japanese Patent Application Kokai LaidOpen Nos. 147,577 1982 and 149,251 1982, Kagaku toSeibutsu , Vol. 19, No. 2, 80 88, and the like. In order to operate this light energy conversion system with a good efficiency, the followings should be taken into account In the second isomerization for returning quadricyclanes, as produced by the first isomerization, to the original norbornadienes, that the catalyst used in said reaction is supported on and fixed to a solid carrier inactive to the reaction, is desired also in preventing the reaction system from pollution, and besides it is very important that the reaction yield is high and particularly the reaction rate also is high. In addition to this, this conversion system is generally operated in a closed and circulating system, so that it is necessary that there is little reduction in the catalytic activity, and that repeated use of a good efficiency is possible.As the fixed catalyst used in this iso...e 1zation reaction, there is known a method to support tetraphenylporphyrin Co II hereinafter, abbreviated to mPDCo II on polystyrene J. Org. Chem., Vol. 44, No. 3, 385 3911. ThisTPPCo II polystyrene catalyst, however, had a problem that not only the reaction yield but also the reaction rate are low, and particularly that repeated use of the catalyst causes a marked reduction in the catalytic activity.It is the object of the invention to provide fixed catalysts which act to accelerate the reaction rate in said isomerization reaction and which have the various defects inherent to the known fixed catalyst improved.According to the present invention there is provided a fixed catalyst for the isomerization reaction from quadricyclanes to norbornadienes obtained by adsorption fixing a deuteroporphyrin IX Co II complex hereinafter, abbreviated to DP IX Co II represented by the formula III , EMI3.1 wherein R2 represents a lower alkyl group and R3 represents a hydroxycarbonyl lower alkyl group, to a modified inorganic carrier in which a polyamine sulfone comprising a recurring unit represented by the formula 11 EMI3.2 wherein R1 represents a lower alkyl group and X represents a halogen atom, has been adsorbed on a solid inorganic carrier. Next, the present invention will be illustrated in detail. By the term quadricyclanes , that material used in the isomerization reaction which is an object of the present invention, are meant various quadricyclane derivatives which include, in addition to quadricyclane having no substituent represented by the formula,EMI4.1 those of which part or all of the 1 to 7 positions have been substituted with one or more members selected from the group consisting of CH3, COOCH3, EMI4.2 CN, CF3 and the like. In the polyamine sulfone comprising a recurring unit represented by the formula 11 , a substituent R1 is a lower alkyl group such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, etc., and a substituent X is a halogen atom such as chlorine, bromine or iodine. In terms of performance, polyamine sulfone in which X is bromine or iodine is more superior to one in which X is chlorine, but chlorine is advantageous economically and practically. As such polyamine sulfone, those which are already on the market, for example PAS A a product ofNittobo Co. and the like are usable. DP IX Co II represented by the formula III is synthesized, for example, from protohemin. In said formula, R2 is a lower alkyl group such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, etc., and R3 is a hydroxycarbonyl lower alkyl group such as hydroxycarbonylrnethyl, hydroxycarbonylpropyl, hydroxycarbonylbutyl, etc. The fixed catalyst of the present invention is obtained by adsorption fixing DP IX Co II to a modified inorganic carrier through an ionic bond, said carrier comprising a solid inorganic carrier having the polyamine sulfone adsorbed thereon. Specifically, the fixed catalyst can be prepared by dipping the modified inorganic carrier in an organic solvent solution, for example pyridine solution of DP IX Co II generally at room temperature for 0.5 to 50 hours, and thereafter removing the solvent. The concentration of DP IX Co II in the organic solvent solution varies with the amount of DP IXCo II to be supported on the carrier, and it may properly be changed according to the condition of use as catalyst.This amount supported is closely related also to the catalytic activity, and the more the amount, the higher the catalytic activity. Generally, however, the amount ofDP IX Co II is 0.01 to 50 mg per gram of the modified inorganic carrier. The modified inorganic carrier used above can be obtained, for example, by dipping an inorganic carrier in an aqueous high concentration solution, preferably aqueous saturated solution of the polyamine sulfone at room temperature or with heating to impregnate the carrier with the solution, and thereafter, drying the impregnated carrier at 600 to 1500C, preferably 900 to 1100C for 10 to 100 hours. For applying the fixed catalyst of the present invention to the isomerization reaction from quadricyclanes to norbornadienes, it is carried out by bringing a nonpolar solvent solution e.g. benzene, toluene, pentane, hexane, heptane, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, carbon disulfine of quadricyclanes of a proper concentration into contact with the catalyst cf the present invention. In this reaction, tre amount of the fixed 6 used 3 catalyst used is generally 1 x 10 6 to 1 x 10 3 mole, as converted to the amount of Co TI in DP IX Co II , per mole of quadricyclanes. But, the amount may exceed this range according to reaction conditions such as the form, temperature, etc. of the reaction. The fixed catalyst of the present invention has very superior characteristics never found in the well known fixed catalysts as described below It keeps not only a high conversion of the isomerization reaction, but also a high level catalytic activity in its repeated use and besides, its catalytic activity is restored nearly 100 by heat treatment at 2000 to 3000C so that its regeneration and re use become possible. Consequently, the isomerization reaction can be carried out advantageously by using said catalyst. Next, the present invention will be illustrated with reference to the following examples.Catalyst preparation example 1 Polyamine sulfone PAS A, a product of NittoboCo. of the formula II in which R1 is CH3 and X is C1, was dissolved in water at room temperature to obtain a saturated aqueous solution. To this solution was added spherical activated alumina AHA, produced by SumitomoAluminum Refining Co. particle diameter, 4 to 6 mm at room temperature and after 15 hours dipping, the alumina was heat dried at 100 C for 48 hours to obtain modified alumina. After this modified alumina was dipped for 24 hours in a thoroughly deaerated pyridine solution ofDP IX Co II of the formula III in which a substituentR2 is CH3 and a substituent R3 is CH2CH2COOH, the pyridine was removed under reduced pressure to obtain a fixed catalyst having 1.9 x 10 5 mole of fixed DP IX Co II per gram of the modified alumina. Example 1 A benzene solution of 2,3 dicyano 1,5,6 trinethylguadricyclane hereinafter, abbreviated to Q was brought into contact with a dichloromethane solution of each catalyst shown in Table.1 at 300C for 12 hours with stirring in a flask to isomerize Q into the corresponding norbornadiene hereinafter, abbreviated to N .As a result, the rate of isomerization of Q N with each catalyst was as shown in Table 2. Whereupon, the amount of each catalyst used was 0.3 time by mole based on Q, and the catalyst of the present invention was used as solid without using a solvent.EMI8.1 Table 1EMI9.1 I tb SEP No. SEP Catalyst SEP Rate SEP of SEP isomeri tb SEP zation SEP of SEP Q N SEP i tb SEP Present SEP 1 SEP DP SEP IX SEP Co II SEP 100 tb SEP 1 SEP l SEP TPP SEP Cho SEP 11 SEP 18.6 tb SEP ComparativeF SEP 1 tb SEP example SEP 2 SEP X SEP Cl SEP 3 tb SEP 3.

Further, this isomerization reaction was carried out over and over under the same condition as above except that the catalyst alone was used repeatedly, and the half life period was measured at each repeated use of the catalyst. As a result, it was found that the half life period at the 8th repeated use was 32.1 minutes, which means that the catalytic activity at that time is 56 18.0 32.1 x 100 of that at the 1st use. For comparison, the isomerization reaction was repeated in completely the same manner as above using TPPCo II supported on polystyrene as a catalyst.As a result, it was found that the half life period at the 1st use of the catalyst was 44.6 minutes and that at the 6th repeated use was as very long as 88.2 minutes.This means that the catalytic activities at the 1st use and 6th repeated use in this comparative example are 40 and only 20 , respectively, of the catalytic activity at the 1st use, as taken as a standard, of the catalyst of the present invention.
