# CONTINUOUS STEEL PLATE QUENCHING APPARATUS.

## Abstract
A continuous steel plate quenching apparatus which quenches a steel plate by continuously cooling the steel plate with cooling water as it is fed. The cooling water is supplied to and exhausted from a water storage tank 10 disposed in the feeding passage of the steel plate 12 and is thus continuously circulated. The steel plate passes through and is cooled in the water storage tank. A plurality of rollers 16, 18 having shafts rotating perpendicular to the direction the steel plate is travelling and impellers 32, 34 rotating on shafts parallel to the rollers are arranged between the rollers in the water storage tank. The steel plate is interposed between the upper rollers and the lower rollers and is thus fed by the rollers. The impellers are disposed in the vicinity of the steel plate to agitate the cooling water and to move the cooling water on the surface of the steel plate at a relatively constant speed with respect to the steel plate. The steel plate is efficiently cooled and quenched by the cooling water moving relative to the steel plate.
