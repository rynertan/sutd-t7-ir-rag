# Analytical method for determining formaldehyde in electroless copper plating bath.

## Abstract
An analytical method for determining by potentiometric titration formaldehyde in an electroless copper plating bath, which comprises using a hydroxylamine salt such as hy droxylamine hydrochloride as the titrant and using a silver electrode as the indicator electrode. This method can determine free formaldehyde in low concentration which takes part in the plating reaction.
