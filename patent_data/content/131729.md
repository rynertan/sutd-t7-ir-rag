# Fiber for optical transmission.

## Abstract
A fiber for optical transmission composed of a core 1 having a substantially parabolic distribution of refractive index, a first cladding layer 2 formed around the core hav ing a refractive index n₁ equal to that of the periphery of the core 1 and a thickness of 1 100 to 1 20 the diameter of the core 1 , a second cladding layer 3 formed around the first cladding layer 2 having a refractive index n₂ smaller than that of the first cladding layer 2 , and a third cladding layer 4 formed around the second cladding layer 3 having a refractive index n₃ greater than that of the second cladding layer. The fiber for optical transmission having such a struct ure has a broad bandwidth of transmitted light.
