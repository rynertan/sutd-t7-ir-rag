# Fluid delivery system.

## Abstract
A valve useful for connecting a source of fluid under pressure to a using apparatus upon actuation of an explosive squib 32 . The connecting structure includes an outer tube of soft material 22 within which there is disposed an additional tube 24 of brittle, frangible material having a reduced diame ter area. The inner and outer tubes define an annular space 44 surrounding an inner tubular space. One of the spaces 42 is connected to the source of fluid under pressure, while the other of the spaces 44 is connected to the using appara tus. Particularly, the inner tubular space is connected to a source of gas under pressure 12 , while the outer annular area is connected to the using apparatus 14 . Upon actuation of the squib the inner frangible tube is broken at the reduced diameter section upon a bending of the outer tube without its fracturing thereby connecting the source of fluid under press ure to the using apparatus, while at the same time isolating the products of combustion of the squib.
