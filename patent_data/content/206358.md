# IN SITU CROSSLINKING OF POLYELECTROLYTES

## Abstract
A composition, useful for forming absorbent articles of a carboxylic polyelectrolyte, is prepared by copolymerizing a carboxylic polyelectrolyte monomer, a reactive self cross linking monomer and a hydrophobic monomer. The compo sition in the form of an emulsion or a viscous solution has an extendable shelf life and may be used to produce a su perabsorbent material or a substrate impregnated with a superabsorbent material.
