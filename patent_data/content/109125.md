# LOGIC CIRCUIT ARRAY

## Abstract
By using de Morgan s theorem, Boolean algebra equa tions can be converted so that it is possible to design a com pact logic array in which the capacitive nodes within the array may be precharged directly rather than through the logic FETs. In consequence a logic array can be fabricated to implement the converted equations, which array can be operated at higher speeds than known circuits for substantially the same power consumption or, conversely, at the same speed as the known circuits with a substantially lower power consumption.
