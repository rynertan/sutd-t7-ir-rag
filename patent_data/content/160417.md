## Description
This invention relates to an improved fermentation process for the manufacture of fermented whey. Suggested bacteria for fermentation, as disclosed in U.S. Patents, 1,910,130 and 1,898,320, include Further, to produce the desired calcium propionate product a difficult to handle and sterilize Ca OH ₂ NaOH slurry was needed for pH control. Therefore, sterile NaOH was used for pH control producing the less desirable sodium propionate. In the improved two stage sequential fermentation described herein, calcium is introduced by pre fermenting pasteurized whey with a lactic acid producing bacterial culture or mixture of bacterial cultures and controlling the pH with Ca OH ₂. This fermented whey, containing high concentrations of Ca lactate, is then sterilized and fermented with a pure culture of propionic acid producing bacterium to produce high concentrations of calcium propionate. To produce calcium propionate into a functionalized whey product, pasteurized whey is fermented with a lactic acid producing bacterial culture or mixture or lactic acid producing bacterial cultures, i.e., According to the invention therefore there is provided a process for the functionalizing whey containing from 0.5 to 18 by weight whey solids by sterilizing the whey and then fermenting the whey with a propionic acid producing organism to produce propionic acid, characterised in that before the sterilization of the whey this is formed into a pre fermentation broth with yeast extract Lactic acid producing bacterial fermentation of a pasteurized whey broth comprising unhydrolyzed whey acid or sweet and yeast extract results in lactic acid formation. This anaerobic fermentation can be carried out preferably in a pH range of 4.0 to 8.5, preferably with the pH maintained in a range from about 4.5 to about 6.0. The fermentation can be carried out at a temperature from about 35 to 60 C, preferably carried out at a temperature from about 40 to about 50 C. Typical composition of Teklac sweet dairy whey is as follows Concentration of whey solids can range from 0.5 to about 18.0 , preferably from about 6 to about 12 , and the concentration of added yeast extract in the fermentation broth can range from about 0.5 to about 4.0 , preferably from about 1.5 to about 3.0 . Sufficient yeast extract to supplement both fermentations is added before the first fermentation for convenience only. The yeast extract may be added before each fermentation if desired. Lactic acid concentrations of about 5.0 are usually reached within 18 hours using 12 whey solids. All of the above weight percents are in weight per volume. The pasteurized, fermented whey described above is neutralized with Ca OH ₂ to a pH of 6.0 to 7.0, UHT sterilized, and fermented with a propionic acid producing bacterium. This anaerobic fermentation can be carried out preferably in a pH range of 5.5 to 8.5 Preferably with the pH maintained in a range from about 6.0 to about 7.0. The fermentation can be carried out at a temperature from about 20 to 40 C, preferably carried out at a temperature from about 35 to 40 C. Propionic acid concentrations of about 2.6 are usually reached within 60 hours at 12 solids fed to the pre fermentation zone. Preferred lactic acid producing bacteria for use as a starter culture in the pre fermentation process are Preferred propionic acid producing bacteria for use in the second fermentation process are An ultra high temperautre UHT sterilization method is a method of sterilization of whey by direct steam injection that results in a whey medium temperature of at least 140 C held for from about 4 to about 20 seconds. Several types of equipment are available to achieve UHT, such as an Alpha Laval sterilizer made by Alpha Laval or an APV heat exchanger made by APV Company, Inc., Tonawanda, N.Y. A shake flask containing 2 Teklac medium was inoculated with 10 ml HGB from one revived stab Fresh pasteurized whey at approximately 6.5 total solids T.S. was the medium used for the inoculum build up. Prior to use the microfirm glass jar fermentor New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, N.J. was sterilized by autoclaving at 250 F 121 C for 30 minutes. Twelve liters of pasteurized whey was inoculated with lactic acid producing organisms. The fermentor was operated at 43 C, no gas was sparged, agitation was 120 160 rpm, and pH was maintained at 6.5 with concentrated NaOH 25 . The whey medium contained 2 dried sweet whey, 1 yeast extract, 0.03 thioglycolic acid, and 0.25 calcium carbonate. Four liters of medium were added to each shake flask along with three drops of FG 10 antifoam Dow chemical Corp. Flasks were autoclaved in a steam sterilizer at 250 F 121 C for 50 minutes. Inoculated flasks were incubated in a G 25 shaker incubator New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, N.J. at 30 C for 48 hours. Lactic acid and lactose were estimated by utilizing a Waters high pressure liquid chromatography unit Waters Instruments, New Milford, Mass. . Propionic acid HPr and acetic acid HAc were assayed by gas chromatography. A Packard Model 5880A with a capillary column J W DX4 column and a flame ionization detector were used. The column temperature was programmed to begin at 90 C and increase to 250 C at a rate of 10 min., injector and detector temperatures were 275 C. The carrier gas was helium with a flow rate of 1.5 ml per minute. Samples were prepared by adding 5 ml of broth to 45 ml of 2 H₃PO₄ containing a valeric acid internal standard. Cells and other suspended solids were removed by filtering through a 0.45 µm acrodisc Gillman Scientific . one microliter µl of the acidified filtrate was injected using a 1.0 µl Hamilton N701 syringe. Results were calculated from a standard curve. Batch fermentations of directly UHT sterilized whey medium containing 12 whey plus 1 yeast extract using pure culture Fresh whey 6.5 solids was received and pasteurized without pH adjustment. Fermentation was initiated by the addition of Hansen s CH 3 culture a mixture of When the pH had decreased to about 4.3, sufficient lime slurry was added to neutralize the lactic acid and bring the pH up to about 6. This procedure was repeated until the pH no longer decreased. At this point there was no detectable lactose remaining. The pH was adjusted to 7 with lime and the media was sterilized by UHT and inoculated with
