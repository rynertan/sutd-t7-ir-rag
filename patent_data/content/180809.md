# Production of epoxy phosphates.

## Abstract
A process of producing a water dispersible epoxy phosphate solvent mixture is disclosed which comprises heating the solvent with orthophosphoric acid to reaction temperature together with additional water so that the total amount of water is sufficient to hydrolyze at least about 50 of the oxirane functionality in the polyepoxide which is used, slowly adding a resinous polyepoxide to this heated mixture so that reaction with phosphoric acid and hydrolysis of the oxirane groups will occur simultaneously to minimize the concentration of oxirane functionality in the reaction mixture as the reaction proceeds, thus minimizing epoxy epoxy reactions which tend to increase the molecular weight of the epoxy phosphate which is formed, and then adding volatile amine to destroy any remaining oxirane functionality and to neutralize the epoxy phosphate to provide a water dispersi ble epoxy phosphate solvent mixture.
