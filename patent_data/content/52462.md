# Multi plane connector for stacked circuit boards.

## Abstract
A multi plane connector is disclosed for making a pluggable interconnection between conductive planes of adjacent pairs of stacked circuit boards. The subject connec tor can be used on any mating edge of a circuit board and does not require the use of either a back plane or a mother board. The subject connector can be especially effective as an add on to original equipment but also can be used as a spacer and interconnect in new equipment. The subject connector has very cost effective stamped and formed contacts providing great economy for the connector.
