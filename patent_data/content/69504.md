# Improved operation and regeneration of permselective ion exchange membrane in brine electrolysis cells.

## Abstract
A method of operating and regenerating an electrolysis cell for electrolysing aqueous alkali metal halide solution and having permselective cation exchange membrane forming an anolyte and a catholyte compartment. The method comprises the steps of feeding to and electrolyzing in said cell a brine which, at least prior to the brine s becoming part of the anolyte, contains no more than 5 ppm hardness expressed as ppm calcium and no more than 70 ppm carbon dioxide, carbonic acid, carbonate and bicarbonate expressed as ppm COâ‚‚ regenerating the membrane by contacting the membrane on at least one of its sides with a solution capable of dissolving the multivalent cation com pounds fouling the membrane for a time sufficient to dissolve a substantial amount of the compounds, the solution having a pH lower than the pH of the electrolyte which contacted that side of the membrane during the normal cell electrolysis.
