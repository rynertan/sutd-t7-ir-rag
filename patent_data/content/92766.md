# Anode composite for molten carbonate fuel cell.

## Abstract
An anode composite useful for a molten carbonate fuel cell comprised of a porous sintered metallic anode compo nent having a porous bubble pressure barrier integrally sintered to one face thereof, said barrier being comprised of metal coated ceramic particles sintered together and to said anode by means of said metal coating, said metal coating enveloping said ceramic particle and being selected from the group consisting of nickel, copper and alloys thereof, the median pore size of the barrier being significantly smaller than that of the anode.
