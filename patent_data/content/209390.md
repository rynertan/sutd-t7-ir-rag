## Description
The present invention relates to an apparatus for continuous processing in the directions of x and y co ordinates, suitable especially for soldering a work piece or semiconductor device, such as, IC , LSI chip of the like, on a substrate plate, wherein the distance between a pair of parallel linear sections to be processed processing lines and the length of the processing line are different in the directions of x and y co ordinates. For soldering terminal pins of semiconductor devices, such as, IC and LSI chips, with those of a substrate, there have been in practical use non contact type apparatuses, in which a laser beam transmitted through a flexible light conducting filament optical fiber is employed to spot irradiate the soldering site to each lead pin of the semiconductor chip with corresponding pin of the substrate, and contact type apparatuses, in which the soldering is effected by using a soldering iron contacting the soldering spot directly. The non contact type soldering apparatuses are costly, since expensive optical elements and devices are required, such as, optical fiber, etc. The irradiation of a soldering spot by a laser beam may sometimes burn the substrate or destroy the semiconductor chip during the processing work because of the high temperature resulting from the irradiation by the laser beam. A contact type soldering apparatus may produce a defective connection in the processed site due to the flux material, contaminants adhering on the soldering iron and so on, so that it is necessary to remove the contaminants and to polish the soldering iron tip in frequent intervals. In particular, several types of soldering iron tip are needed since it has been necessary to change or replace the soldering iron tip in accordance with the alteration of the type and form of the semiconductor chip to be processed. In addition, in the case of contact type apparatuses, continuous processing in directions of x and y co ordinates is not possible when the distance between the processing lines or the length thereof is different in the directions of x and y co ordinates, since it is necessary to let the iron tip contact with each processing site. According to the present invention there is provided apparatus for processing a work piece by irradiating a pair of coplanar parallel processing lines with heat rays characterised in that it comprises heat ray source means mounted on a heat ray source assembly and means for focussing the heat rays into lines on said processing lines means for moving the work piece and heat ray source means towards and away from each other so as to bring the work piece into and out of the focus of the heat rays and to effect relative rotation of the heat ray source means and work piece to allow the processing of further processing lines extending in different directions to the first mentioned processing lines means for adjusting the distance between the parallel line foci of the heat rays and an adjustable masking element disposed between the heat ray source means and the work piece to vary the width of the beam of heat rays thereby to determine the length of the line focus of the heat rays. In more detail the present invention provides an apparatus for processing a work piece, characterised in that it comprises a pair of heat ray sources, arranged on a heat ray source assembly, for irradiating a pair of parallel processing lines by focussing heat rays into lines along said processing lines, said heat ray source assembly being rotatable so as to allow said line foci to be aligned with processing lines extending in a different direction to the first lines, a cylinder piston arrangement for effecting vertical positioning of said pair of heat ray sources for adjusting the focussing of the heat rays onto said processing line, a distance adjusting means for adjusting the distance between said pair of parallel line foci by effecting a relative shifting of said pair of heat ray sources, a masking element provided for each heat ray source and comprising a shield member for defining the width of the heat ray beam leaving the heat ray source and thereby determining the length of the line focus and masking element actuating means provided for each of said pair of heat ray sources and comprising at least one cylinder piston unit for effecting shifting of said shield member to vary the width of the heat ray beam and thus to vary the length of the line focus. The present invention therefore allows continuous processing of a work piece by continuous and successive soldering along pairs of soldering lines in different directions, even when the distance between the pairs of parallel processing lines and the length thereof are different in the different directions. The fact that the heat ray beam is concentrated or focussed onto the processing line in a prolonged focus denoted hereinafter as line focus in a form of a segment of a line having a length corresponding to that of the processing line, means that little extraneous heat will irradiate the portion other than the processing line. Furthermore the distance between the pair of line focuses of heat ray beams irradiating the pair of processing lines and the length of the line focus may be automatically adjusted during the time interval after the finish of the processing of the first lines till the commencement of the processing of the further lines, whereby the total processing time for one complete cycle of processing effected in both the directions can be decreased. The pair of heat ray sources are assembled on a heat ray source assembly which may be rotated, in order that the processing, for example, soldering, of processing lines extending in an x co ordinate direction may be automatically succeeded by processing in a y co ordinate direction. Thus, the soldering of a pair of processing lines in the direction of x co ordinate is first carried out by a pair of heat ray beams, each of which is focussed onto the processing line, e.g. a soldering line in which a row of terminal lead pins of the semiconductor chip and a row of corresponding terminal lead pins on the substrate plate are aligned, and thereafter the soldering of a pair of processing lines in the direction of y co ordinate is effected by turning round the heat ray source assembly through an angle of 90 . In order to allow the distance between the pair of line foci to coincide with the distance between the pair of processing lines not only in the x direction but also in the y direction, said pair of heat ray sources are subjected to a parallel shifting while holding a constant orientation toward each of the processing lines, e.g. at a constant angle to the processing line. On the other hand, the adjustment of the length of line focus irradiating the processing line for the processing in x direction and for the processing in y direction is attained in such a manner, that a pair of automatically slidable shield members are disposed on each heat ray discharge opening of the heat ray source. Thus, even when the work piece to be processed has different processing lengths in x and y directions, an automatic adjustment of the line focus not only in the distance between the pair of line foci but also in the length of each line focus can be attained. Therefore, there is no limitation in the size and type of work piece and a reduction in the total processing time required for complete cycle of processing work including processing steps in x and y directions is achieved, so that the work performance is markedly improved. By the automatic succession from the processing step of x direction to that of y direction by turning round the heat ray source assembly through a right angle, the work piece need be postioned once only on the work table and then can be processed automatically in both the x and y directions in a continuous manner. The invention will be further described by way of non limitative example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 shows an arrangement of a semiconductor device 2, such as IC or LST chip, on a substrate for processing by soldering in plan view. The semiconductor chip 2 is provided with a number of terminal lead pins 1a, 1b in alignment with the corresponding terminal lead pins 2a, 2b of the substrate plate 1. The work piece held in this orientation is set on a work table not shown . The relationship betwen the distance L₁ of the two parallel processing lines extending in the direction of x co ordinate and the distance L₂ of the two parallel processing lines extending in the direction of y co ordinate in this embodiment of Figure 1 is L₁ L₂. Thus, a pair of processing lines in the x direction are irradiated by a corresponding pair of heat ray beams focussed in a line focus having a length of l₁ apart. In a similar way, the processing in the y direction is performed by a pair of heat ray beams focussed onto the corresponding pair of processing lines extending in y direction as line foci having length l Figure 2 shows an embodiment of the apparatus according to the present invention in a front view. The apparatus has a vertical support 3 fixed to the apparatus by fixing bolts 4, 4. On one side left side in Figure 3 of the vertical support 3, a bracket 5 is arranged integrally by screw bolts 6, 6. The bracket 5 has a longer supporting part 7 and a shorter supporting part 8. On the underside of the longer supporting part 7 are fixed guide sleeves 9, 9 by, for example, screwing their upper ends thereinto. Inside the guide sleeves is inserted each a guide rod 10 so as to allow vertical movement. Each guide rod 10 has a stopper 11 at its upper end. The guide rods 10 are held at the lower ends thereof on a holder table 12. A connection lug 13 is arranged on the upper face of the holder table 12 and serves for connecting with a piston rod 14 of a cylinder piston arrangement 17 by a split shank 15 with a connection pin 16. The piston rod 14 performs a vertical movement by a cylinder piston arrangement 17 operating in a h aulic or pneumatic principle. The holder table 20 carries a driving means consisting of, such as, an air rotary actuator. The driving movement of the driving means 18 is transmitted to a rotatable shaft 22 by a belt pulley transmission means 19,20 . The rotatable shaft 22 is held rotatably inserted in a bearing hole 23 disposed in the holder table 12. The rotatable shaft 22 is provided at its upper end with an upper supporting plate 24 on which a cylinder piston actuator 25 operating in a hydraulic or pnewmatic principle for effecting the adjustment of the distance of the pair of line focuses irradiating onto the corresponding pair of process lines. The piston rod 26 of the cylinder piston actuator 25 is connected on a connection member 27 which is connected to this side to a link connection consisting of two links 28, 29 and a connection pin 30. Each of the links 28, 29 is connected on the other side to either one of a pair of slide members 33, 34 by a pivot joint 31, 32. The pair of slide members 33, 34 are further connected with each other on the other side by a link connection consisting of two links 35, 36 and a connection pin 37. The pair of slide members 33, 34 are guided at their end portions on a pair of guide rods 38, 39 slidably. The pair of guide rods 38, 39 are disposed fixedly in a parallel arrangement through 41, 42 a lower supporting plate 40 arranged at the lower end of the rotatable shaft 22. Each of the pair of slide members 33, 34 is provided on its underside an arm 43, 44. The arms 43, 44 carry each a heat ray source 47, 48 through a pivot joint 45, 46. The shorter supporting part 8 of the bracket 5 carries a cylinder piston unit 49 operated in a hydraulic or pneumatic principle which is connected to, for example, an air source not shown via a pipe 50. The piston rod 51 thereof is connected to a junction member 53 by a connection piece 52. The junction member 53 is connected on this side to an air pipe 54 through which, for example, cooling air from a cooling air source now shown is supplied. To the junction member 53 is further connected an arrester tube 55 at its upper end. The arrester tube 55 is constituted of, for example, a metal tube and extends through a penetrating hole 56 disposed at the center of the rotatable shaft 22 freely slidably up to a portion near the work piece. The lower end of the arresting tube 55 opens freely to allow discharge of the cooling air. It is possible that many slits are formed around the tube end periphery in an adequate uniform circumferential distribution so as to effect a uniform discharge of the cooling air around the tube end. The rotatable shaft 22 has at its lower end a threaded hole 58 see Figure 5 in which a guide tube 59 is inserted by screwing therein. The arrester tube 55 is disposed penetrating the guide tube 59 freely movably. At the lower end of the guide tube 59, a centering collar 60 is attached removably which serves to settle the minimum distance between the pair of line focuses of heat ray beams 61, 62 emitted from the heat ray lamps 63, 64 of the pair of heat ray sources 47, 48. Therefore, various sizes of centering collars 60 having varying outer diameters are kept in preservation for optional use in accordance with each particular processing work. Thus, in a practical application of the apparatus according to the present invention, the distance between the pair of line focuses of heat ray beams is first let coincide to the distance L₁ between the pair of processing lines in the direction of x co ordinate, a suitable centering collar 60 can easily be chosen by reading the correlation diagram given in Figure 7. Thus, for example, if the distance L₁ between the pair of processing lines is assumed to be 15 mm, a suitable centering collar 60 should have an outer diamter of 11.8 mm. In order to settle the distance L₂ between the pair of processing lines in the direction of y co ordinate, the angle of directing the heat ray source to the processing line is adjusted by an adjusting screw 60a arranged so as to permit an adjustment of the travelling stroke of the screw in a support member 60b arranged on the lower supporting plate 40. The adjusting screw 60a is positioned directly under the connection pin 37 connecting the links 35 and 36 see Figure 6 . The lower edge of the links 35, 36 will abut onto the top of the adjusting screw 60a and thus offers limitation of the horizontal mutual shifting of the pair of slide members 33, 34 to thereby cause limitation of the maximum interval of the pair of heat ray sources 47, 48, so that the distance between the pair of line focuses of heat ray beams can be set to coincide with the distance L₂ between the pair of processing lines of y direction. The heat ray sources 47, 48 are provided each with a heat ray lamp 63, 64 and a glass cover plate 65 made of a heat resistant glass, such as, quartz glass, Pyrex trade name or so on, over its heat ray discharging opening see Figures 8 and 9 . The heat resistant glass plate 65 is inserted removably along the receptacle part 68, 69 formed at the lower end of the reflecting side plates 66, 67 of the heat ray source by bending a portion thereof. The glass plate is supported on a supporting frame 70 extending over the entire width of the glass plate 65 on the underside of one the two receptacle parts 68. The end portion on the entrance side of the supporting frame 70 is bent downwards a little, in order to ease the insertion of the glass plate 65 refer to Figure 9 . In order to prevent draw out of the glass plate 65 so inserted, it is retained by a vertically slidable stopper 71 see Figure 11 disposed on the heat ray source body. Since the structure of the heat ray source is the same for both the sources 47 and 48, the explanation thereof is directed hereinafter only to the heat rav source 47. In order to limit the longitudinal extension of the heat ray beams and thus to limit the length of the line focus, the heat ray source is provided with a masking element consisting essentially of a pair of shield members 72, 73 disposed on the outer face of the heat resistant glass plate 65 slidably along it see Figure 8 . Each heat ray source has a pair of shield members 72, 73 each of which has peripheral risinq hedges 72a, 73a surrounding it to form a heat ray shielding space 74, 75. A part of the surrounding hedges 72a is cut off 72b so as to facilitate venting off of heat accumulated within the heat ray source. The longitudinal hedges are inclinedly formed see Figure 10 , in order to prevent substantial contact of the surrounding hedges 72a, 73a to the arrester tube 55, even if the pair of heat ray sources 47, 48 are positioned close to the minimum distance with each other see Figure 2 . Each of the pair of shield members 72, 73 is provided with a stopper block 76, 77 Figures 8, 10 . Through this stopper block 76, 77, a guide bar 78, 79 is inserted. The guide bar 78, 79 is coupled with a flexible actuation transmission wire 82, 83 which is connected at its other end to a piston rod 86, 87 of a cylinder piston unit 84, 85 operating in a pneumatic principle. The cylinder piston unit 84 is associated with the shield member 72 and the cylinder piston unit 85 is associated with the shield member 73 see Figure 2 . Each shield member is further provided with a stopper screw 88, 89 which serves for limiting the shifting movement of the shield member 72, 73 by abutting thereto. If the travelling stroke of the stopper screws 88,89 is chosen to be small, the amount of shift of the pair of shield members 72, 73 becomes large and, thus, a longer line focus of the heat ray beam is attained, so that a longer processing length l₂ in the direction of x co ordinate can be adjusted in a simple manner. In a similar way, a shorter processing length l₂ in the direction of y co ordinate can be adjusted by setting the travelling stroke of the stopper screw at a correspondingly greater value. The actual manner of operation of th e apparatus according to the present invention is as follows Each row of the terminal lead pins 1a, 1b of the semiconductor chip is aligned to the corresponding row of terminal lead pins 2a, 2b on the substrate plate 1 so as to align each terminal lead pin of the semiconductor chip to the corresponding terminal lead pin of the substrate. Then, the distance of the pair of line focuses of the heat ray beams and the length of the line focus is adjusted so as to coincide to those L₁, l₁ and L₂, l₂ of the pair of processing lines. If, for example, the distance between the pair of processing lines of the direction of x co ordinate L₁ is assumed to be 19 mm, a centering collar 60 having an outer diameter of 13,5 mm should be chosen from the correlation diagram of Figure 7. This centering collar 60 is mounted on the guide tube 59 at its lower end. Each of the pair of heat ray sources 47, 48 is tilted around the pivot joint 45 or 46, until the side edge of the heat ray source will abut onto the side face of the centering collar 60. In this same manner, the interval of the pair of parallel line focuses of the heat ray beams 61, 62 emitted from the pair of heat ray sources 47, 48 will coincide with the distance L₁ between the pair of parallel processing lines of the direction of x co ordinate. In order thereafter to adjust the length of the line focus so as to coincide with the processing length l₁ of x direction, the travelling stroke of the stopper screw 88, 89 is settled correspondingly to determine the amount of shifting of the shield members 72, 73. For adjusting the distance between the pair of line focuses so as to coincide with the distance l₂ between the pair of processing lines of y direction, the travelling stroke of the adjusting screw 70a is correspondingly settled to adjust the position of contact with the links 35, 36, in order to limit correspondingly the articular spreading movement of the links 28, 29 to thereby attain coincidence of the distance between the pair of line focuses of the heat ray beams 61, 62 with said distance L₂ between said pair of processing lines. Likewise, for attaining adjustment of the processing length l₂ in the direction of y co ordinate, the travelling stroke of the stopper screw 88, 89 is settled correspondingly so as to attain a suitable adjustment of the width of heat ray discharging opening to thereby reach a suitable length of the line focus corresponding to the requisite processing length l₁ in the direction of y co ordinate. In carrying out soldering of a semiconductor chip on a substrate, the pneumatic cylinder piston unit 49 is operated to let descend the arrester tube 55 until the lower end thereof will touch the semiconductor chip 2 at the center thereof to pressingly arrest the work piece in a suitable condition. Then the cylinder piston arrangement 17 is actuated so as to cause the piston rod 14 to descend to lower the heat ray source assembly to a position at which the heat ray beams 61, 62 from the heat ray lamp 63, 64 will be focussed onto the pair of processing lines extending parallel in the direction of x co ordinate with a processing length l₁ and the distance L₁ between them, in a pair of line focuses having a corresponding length and a corresponding distance between them. The soldering is effected by irradiating the processing lines by said pair of heat ray beams focussed onto them. After the finish of the processing in the direction of x co ordinate, cooling air is supplied through the arrester tube 55 to blow onto the upper face of the work piece. At the same time, the holder table 20 is elevated by actuating the cylinder piston arrangement 17 and, then, the heat ray source assembly is turned by 90 by operating the turning element. Thus, the driving means 18 is energised to rotate the pulley means 19, 21 via the belt 20 to cause rectangular turning of the assembly. In order to adjust the distance betw een the pair of line focuses so as to coincide with the distance L₂ between the pair of processing lines, the cylinder piston actuater 25 is energised to cause the piston rod 26 to protrude so as to slide the slide members 33, 34 on the guide rods 38, 39 through the links 28, 29 to effect a parallel shifting of the slide members in the opposited direction with each other. This spreading movement is limited by abutment of the links 28, 29 onto the adjusting screw 60a, whereby a distance between the pair of line focuses corresponding to the distance L₂ between the pair of processing lines is settled. In order to adjust the processing length l₂, the cylinder piston units 84, 85 disposed on the upper supporting plate is actuated, so as to cause simultaneous sliding of the shield members 72, 73 in the direction of approach with each other, whereby a length of the line focus corresponding to that of processing line in the direction of y co ordinate is attained. The above described movement of each part of the apparatus is started upon the finish of the processing work in the direction of x co ordinate at the same time with the starting of elevation of the heat ray source assembly and will be finished till the commencement of the processing work in the direction of y co ordinate. After the heat ray source assembly has been set for the processing of y direction, the heat ray source assembly is caused to descend by the cylinder piston arrangement 17 in the same manner as explained above to realise the irradiation of the pair of processing lines by focussing the heat ray beams threonto to effect soldering within a moment. Thereafter, the blowing of the cooling air from the arrester tube 55 onto the work piece and the lifting of the heat ray source assembly are accomplished in the same manner as explained above. The supply of cooling air is then stopped and the arrester tube 55 is lifted by the action of the pneumatic cylinder piston unit 49. In this manner, one complete cycle of the processing work inclusive of processing steps of x and y directions is completed. It is of couse possible to employ the apparatus only for the processing of only one direction, namely, in x or y co ordinate.
