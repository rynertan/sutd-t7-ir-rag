# A method of manufacturing a semiconductor device.

## Abstract
A layer 2 formed on a semiconductor substrate 1 has a projection or epitaxial rock 4 thereon. To remove the projection 4 an etch resistant membrane 3 is formed over the layer 2 . A flat plate 5 is pressed against the membrane 3 to rupture the membrane where it covers the projection 4 to expose the projection 4 . The projection 4 is then etched.
