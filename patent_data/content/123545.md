# Nonwoven sheet, method for making the same, and composite sheet incorporating it.

## Abstract
A nonwoven sheet has fine individual fibres and yarn like fire bundles, all oriented mainly in the lengthwise direction of the sheet, the fibre bundles outnumbering the individual fine fibres on one surface of the sheet, and the individual fine fibres outnumbering the fibre bundles on the opposite sur face. Composite sheets may be made from this nonwoven sheet and another material, notably a nonwoven web of short staple fibres with a thin aluminium coating on one surface. A method of making the nonwoven sheet of the invention involves ejecting a molten thermoplastic polymer from a spinneret 8 using ejecting currents. The angle Î± between the line of ejecting current 9 and the surface of a collecting member 11 is preferably between 15 and 75 .
