# Bladed rotor turning apparatus.

## Abstract
A bladed rotor turning tool comprising a rotatable shaft 1 , a finger 7 articulated on the end of the shaft about an axis substantially perpendicular to the shaft axis, the inclina tion of the finger relative to the shaft axis being controlled by cam means 10,11,12 14 so that the finger varies between being substantially perpendicular to the shaft axis and being substantially parallel to the shaft axis at diametrically opposed shaft positions. The cam means may comprise a cam surface 14 at the end of a sleeve 13 in which the shaft is positioned and means 10,11,12 for urging the finger into contact with the cam surface. Two such fingers may be provided to improve turning.
