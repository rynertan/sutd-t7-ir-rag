# A method of producing a nickel base alloy structure with Ni Al coating.

## Abstract
A structure comprising a main body formed of a nickel base alloy, and a NiAl coating applied to the main body, wherein the NiAl coating includes a nickel rich NiAl layer and an alumi num rich NiAl layer and the thickness ratio of the nickel rich Ni Al layer to the whole NiAl coating is in a range between 20 and 40 . Particular good corrosion and thermal shock properties can be produced in this way. The structure may be a turbine blade or turbine nozzle. The structure can be produced by a version of the pack cementation process in which the heat treatments satisfy a particular formula.
