# Assay method employing fluorescent cell incorporative dye.

## Abstract
A method is provided for determining the presence in a sample of a member of a specific binding pair sbp member consisting of ligand and its homologous receptor. The sample is combined in an aqueous medium with 1 a complementary sbp member wherein at least the sbp member or the complementary sbp member is bound to the surface of a cell and 2 a fluorescent agent capable of being incorporated into the cell. The presence of the sbp member is indicated by a change in fluorescence of the unseparated cell suspension as a result of agglutination of the cells. The present invention has particular application to blood typing, for example, for the determination of the presence of blood group antigens A, B, AB, O, and D Rhâ‚€ and antibodies to such antigens.
