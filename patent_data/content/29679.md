# Photoelectric device.

## Abstract
A photosensor having a metal electrode 12, at least one photoelectric conversion layer 10 which covers the metal electrode 12, and a transparent or partly transparent conduc tive layer 9 which covers the photoelectric conversion layer 12 is characterized in that a recombination layer 11 for recombining electrons and holes is disposed between the metal electrode 12 and the photoelectric conversion layer 10. The recombination layer 11 enables a metal electrode 12 hav ing an insulating oxide film on its surface to be used in a photoelectric device as if the insulating oxide film were non existent. In prior art photosensors lacking such a layer the current which flows when the device is in the dark is not suppressed and this results in a bad photo response. The present invention suppresses such current and thus improves the photo response of the photosensor.
