# PISTON ACCUMULATOR

## Abstract
A piston accumulator comprising a piston 2 reciprocat ing within the bore of a cylinder 4 to divide the bore into a hydraulic chamber 5 and a gas chamber 6 . The piston 2 includes a piston poppet assembly 1 to equalise substan tially the liquid gas pressure appearing across the piston seal 13 . The assembly 1 projects into the hydraulic chamber 5 from its housed position within a socket recess 15 formed in the piston 2 . In response to an excess pressure differential between the gas chamber 6 and liquid chamber 5 of the accumulator, the assembly 1 prematurely seals off the hyd raulic passage 9 which communicates with the hydraulic chamber 5 of the accumulator. This premature sealing oper ation traps and pressurises a small portion of hydraulic liquid within the reduced hydraulic chamber 5 so that the pressure differential which would otherwise appear across the piston seal 13 is reduced or eliminated.
