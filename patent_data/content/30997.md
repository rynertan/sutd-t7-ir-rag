# DIGITAL POSITION SENSOR

## Abstract
A position sensing element forms a reactance inductive or capacitivel in the L C tuning circuit of an oscillator. The reactance varies as a function of the position of the sensing element relative to a predetermined object. This causes the resonant frequency of the oscillator to vary as a function of the position of the sensing element. The output of the oscillator is squared to provide a square wave signal, the frequency of which is direct function of the position of the sensing element relative to the predetermined object.
