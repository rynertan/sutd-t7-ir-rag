# Method and apparatus for detecting position of object with ultrasonic wave.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method of detecting a position of an object with an ultrasonic wave, wherein a plurality of kinds of ultrasonic wave pulses having unequal pulse widths which are set in accordance with distance ranges to expected objects to be sensed are transmitted, and according to which wait times for reflected waves from the objects are set so as to detect the position of the object furthermore an apparatus is proposed for performing the aforementioned method.
