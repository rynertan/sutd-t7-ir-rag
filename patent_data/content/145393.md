# The reinforcement of engine blocks.

## Abstract
The problem of cracking in scantlings 11 of aluminium or aluminium alloy engine blocks by direct and torsional forces applied thereto by a crankshaft is mitigated by cast ing, into the scantlings, reinforcements 13 of a ferrous material. Each reinforcement includes threaded bosses 14 for receiving the bolts 22 which hold an associated cap 12 onto the scantling 11 and also flat elongate members 18 which extend into the scantling. Since the threads are of a ferrous material, they are more resistant to damage than similar threads of aluminium or aluminium alloy and the elongate members spread the loading throughout the scant ling, so reducing the tendency of these loads to crack the scantling. This technique can be of particular benefit where an engine is being modified in a way which produces in creased stresses for example where a petrol engine is being converted for use as a diesel engine.
