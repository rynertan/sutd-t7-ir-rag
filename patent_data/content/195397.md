## Description
m CYANOPHENETHANOLAMINES AS ANIMAL GROWTH PROMOTERS AND ANTILIPOGENIC AGENTS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The m cyanophenethanolamine compounds such as m l hydroxy 2 isopropylamino ethyl benzonitrile and m 2 tert butylamino l bydroxyethyl benzontrile are described by L. Villa, Coll., I1 Farmaca Ediz.Sci., 29, 162 166. However, these compounds are not known to be effective for increasing the growth rate of animals and or inhibiting the deposition of body fat in said animals or reducing the body fat thereof. Although J. A. Kiernan and P. K. Baker,United States Patents 4,404,222 and 4,407,819, issuedSeptember 13, 1983 and October 4, 1983, respectively, have disclosed the use of certain phenethanolamines for increasing the growth rate and improving the lean meat to fat ratio of meat producing animals, they have neither indicated nor suggested that the compounds useful in the present invention would be useful for increasing the growth rate of animals or reducing the body fat thereof. Recently, European Patent Application 103830 was published describing substituted phenylethylamine derivatives which were said to be growth promoters for pigs, cows, poultry, cats, dogs, rabbits, fur animals, fish, and reptiles. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a method for increasing the growth rate of warm blooded animals, such as meat producing animals and domestic pets by orally or parenterally administering thereto a growth rate enhancing amount of a m cyanophenethanolamine compound, namely m r l bydroxy 2 isopropylamino ethyl 3 benzonitrile and m 2 tert butylamino 1 hydroxyethyl benzonitrile. It also relates to a method for reducing the body fat of said animals and or inhibiting the deposition of body fat in such animals1 by orally or parenterally administering to said animals a body fat inhibiting or reducing amount of the m cyanophenethanolamine compound. The invention is especially useful to poultrymen, farmers and ranchers, in the rearing of poultry, cattle, swine, sheep and goats, since it provides them with an effective and convenient means for obtaining larger leaner animals having improved carcass quality and increased weight. This invention is likewise useful to pet owners and veterinarians, since it provides them with an effective and convenient means for reducing the body fat of pet animals, thereby yielding leaner, more vibrant pets. The compounds useful in the method of the present invention exhibit surprisingly low ssl heart stimulant activity. As such, they have a significantly improved or added margin of safety in their use over art compounds that exhibit substantial ssl heart stimulant activity. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The above identified compounds which are useful in the practice of the method of the present invention may be illustrated by formula I EMI3.1 wherein R is isopropyl or tert butyl and the optical isomers thereof and the non toxic, pharmacologically acceptable acid addition salts thereof. In accordance with this invention a formula I compound can be administered either orally or parenterally to domestic or farm animals with resultant increases in growth rates and or reduction of body fat or inhibition of fat deposition. The active compounds may be mixed directly with animal feeds or, preferably, prepared in the form of an animal feed premix, animal feed concentrate, or feed supplement which can be blended with the feed or applied as a top dressing thereto. Regardless of which procedure is selected for administration, the active compound should be proffered in an amount sufficient to provide from about 0.05 to 200 ppm of active compound of preferably 0.05 to 100 ppm of active compound in the total feed. Animal feed premixes, supplements or concentrates are readily prepared by mixing, on a weight basis, about 0.5 to 50Z of a benzonitrile derivative or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof with about 50Z to 99.5Z of a edible diluent. Diluents suitable for use in the manufacture of animal feed supplements, concentrates, and premixes include corn meal, soybean meal, bone meal, alfalfa meal, cottonseed oil meal, urea, molasses, and other similar materials. Use of the diluents in feed supplements, concentrates, and premixes improves uniformity of distribution of the active ingredient in the finished feed. Feeds for swine, cattle, sheep, and goats generally contain about 0.05 to 200 grams of active ingredient per ton of feed with an optimum level of about 0.125 to 100 grams of active ingredient per ton of feed. Poultry and domestic pet feeds are usually prepared in such a manner as to contain from about 0.05 to 100 grams and most preferably about 0.1 to 100 grams of active ingredient per ton of feed. For parenteral administration of the active ingredient, the formula I benzonitrile or pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof, is formulated as a paste or pellet and administered to the animals by subcutaneous injection. This procedure involves injection of a sufficient amount of the formulated paste or a sufficient number of pellets which contain the formula I compound to provide the animals with about 0.001 to 100 mg kg of body weight day of said active compound. The preferred dosage for swine, cattle, sheep, and goats ranges from about 0.001 to 50 mg day kg of body weight of the benzonitrile or pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof. The preferred dosage of the formula I compound for poultry and domestic pets ranges from about 0.001 to 10 mg day kg of animal body weight. Paste or gel formulations suitable for subcutaneous injection can be prepared by dispersing a for mula I benzonitrile or pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof in a pharmacologically acceptable diluent, such as butylene glycol, peanut oil, corn oil, seasame oil, or a clear aqueous, thermally reversible, gel composition. A typical gel formulation can be prepared in accordance with the following procedure. The gellant phase is prepared by slurring the gellant 15 to 50Z and preferably 15Z to 35Z by weight of formulation in propylene glycol 14 to 30 by weight for 15 minutes to one hour under reduced pressure 25 to 50 mmHg at room temperature. The gellant selected is a nonionic surfactant of structure a hydro n hydroxy poly oxy ethylene poly oxypropylene poly oxyethylene block copolymer, average molecular weight 12,500 mp 560C Brookfield viscosity of 3,100 at 770C surface tension of a 0.15 aqueous solution 40.6 dynes cm measured with a duNouy tensiometer . As aqueous solution containing the remaining ingredients may be prepared by dissolving or dispersing the benzonitrile or an acceptable salt thereof, preferably the hydrochloride, in amounts of from about 3 by weight to about 25 by weight and preferably 6 to 12 by weight of final formulation in deionized or distilled water used in amounts of from about 15 by weight to about 505 by weight and preferably 35 to 45 by weight of formulation. This solution is buffered by dissolving 1.5Z by weight of citric acid and 1.0 by weight of trisodium citrate to provide a pH range at which long term chemical stability of the components is achieved, i.e., pH 3 3.5. Optional components, which may be incorporated into the above solution at this stage are a. Benzyl alcohol added in amounts of from about 0.S by weight to about 1.5 by weight and preferably 1.5 by weight of formulation as an antimicrobial preservative b. The yellow dye C.I. Acid yellow No 23, tartrazine, F. D. C yellow No 5 4,5 dihydro 5 oXo l 4 sulfophenyl 4 t sulfophenyl azol lH pyrazole 3 carboxylic acid trisodium salt used as a coloring agent in amounts of from about 0.01 by weight to about 0.03 by weight and preferably 0.01 by weight of formulation c.An anti foaming agent comprising a mixture of dimethylpolysiloxanes of structure EMI6.1 and silica gel, wherein the calculated average value of m is 200 to 350, the mixture is a water white viscous oil like liquid d 0.965 0.970 nod25 about 1.404 viscosity about 60,000 centistrokes used in amount of from 0.001 to 0.02 by weight and preferably 0.02 by weight of formulation. The lipolytic and antilipogenic gel of this invention is prepared by simply mixing either of the above gellant phases and the aqueous solution from one half hour to two hours under reduced pressure of from 10 to 100 mmHg and preferably 25 to 50 mm Hg at ambient temperatures of from 200C to 600C, without the requirements of either additional heating or cooling. This procedure gives an air free gel which is suitable for administering exact dosages of the antilipogenic composition by volume. Pellets for subcutaneous injection can be prepared by mixing a formula I, benzonitrile or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof with a suitable diluent, such as montan wax, carbowax, carnauba wax or the like, and compressing the same into a pellet form. A lubricant such as magnesium or calcium stearate can be added to improve the pelleting process if so desired. In order to obtain the drug dosage levels necessary to achieve desired results i.e., increase in growth rates and or improvement in lean meat to fat ratios , it may be necessary to administer multiple pellets. Also, implants may be made periodically during treatment periods in order to maintain proper drug levels in the animals. In addition to improve growth rates and reduce body fat obtained with the compounds of this invention, administration of formula I compounds to meat producing animals frequently results in enhanced efficiency of feed utilization thereby and reduced feed costs to bring the animals to market weight. With the use of materials and methods revealed in the present invention, producers can market superior quality meat animals in a short period of time while incurring minimum feed costs. The following non limiting examples further serve to illustrate the invention. EXAMPLE 1Preparation of m C2 ter butylamino l hydroxyetbyl benzonitrile To a mixture of 250 mL p dioxane, 15 mL of water and 15.4 g selenium dioxide maintained at 600C is added 10 g, 0.069 mol of m acetylbenzonitrile. The mixture is heated to refluxing temperature for 20 hours then filtered, stripped, partitioned between dichioromethane and water 500 mL 3 X 200 mL , then dried with dichloromethane and stripped to 200 mL. To the remaining mixture is added tert butylamine in two 10.1 g portions.The mixture is stirred for one hour at room temperature, stripped at 350C over a one hour period, then triturated with anhydrous ethylene oxide and filtered, leaving a white solid. The white solid is added to 50 mL of ethanol and the mixture treated with four 10.5 g samples of sodium borohydride.The resulting mixture is stirred for five hours, then stripped, and the remaining residue partitioned between water and dichloromethane 3 X 200 mL 500 mL . After partioning the dichloromethane portion is dried with magnesium sulfate and stripped to give a white solid.After drying over refluxing acetone the product, referred to above, is obtained and has a melting point of 86 C to 87 C. Product analysis showed the following Z cal cd. C 71.56 H 8.26 N 12.84 Found C 71.83 H 8.16 N 12.72 The reaction described above may be illustrated as follows EMI9.1 EXAMPLE 2Preparation of l hydroxy 2 isopropylamino ethylj benzonitrile Selenium dioxide 15.4 grams, in a solution of 250 mL of dioxane and 15 mL of water is warmed to 600C and stirred until it is homogenous. Thereafter 10.0 grams of acetylbenzonitrile is added to the mixture and stirred until the mixture is homogeneous and turns from yellow to red in color.The mixture is then refluxed for 20 and one half hours, treated with charcoal and magnesium sulfate and filtered while hot to give a yellowish filtrate which, when stripped, yields 11 grams of a clear oil, m glyoxyloylbenzonitrile. The oil is partioned between 500 mL of dichloromethane and water and dried over magnesium sulfate, then stripped to about 100 mL. The reaction may be illustrated as follows EMI10.1 The thus prepared m glyoxyloyl benzonitrile which is dispersed in 100 mL of dichloromethane, is then treated with isopropylamine added in six 24 grams po rtions. The mixture is stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes, then stripped at 320C to give a yellow oil which, when concentrated yields 13.8 grams of m l N isopropyl formimidoyl formyl benzonitrile, in the form of a red oil. The thus prepared benzonitrile is then stirred with 250 mL of absolute ethanol at room temperature. Sodium borohydride is added to the mixture in four 10.5 gram portions while. maintaining the temperature of the mixture at 200 250C. The mixture is stirred for 16 hours and then stripped to give the desired product in the form of a yellow gram. The above reactions may be illustrated as follows EMI11.1 EXAMPLE 3Evaluation of test compounds as animal growth promoters and antilipogenic agents mouse tests CFI female mice from Carworth Farms are received when they are six weeks old. They are housed ten to A cage in air conditioned rooms 220C to 250C with automatically controlled lights, 14 hours on and ten hours off. The basal diet used in these studies is PurinaLaboratory Chow see description below which is supplied ad libitum. The following is a description of the diet to which the growth promoting compounds were added. DIET Guaranteed Analysis Crude Protein not less than 23.0 Crude fat not less than 4.55 Crude fiber not more than 6.05 Ash not more than 9.0 Ingredients Meat and bone meal, dried skimmed milk, wheat germ meal, fish meal, animal liver meal, dried beet pulp, ground extruded corn, ground oat groats, soybean meal, dehydrated alfalfa meal, cane molasses, animal fat preserved with BHA, vitamin B12 supplement, calcium pantothenate, choline chloride, folic acid, riboflavin supplement, brewer s dried yeast, thiamin, niacin, vitamin A supplement, D activated plant sterol, vitamin E supplement, calcium carbonate, dicalcium phosphate, iodized salt, ferric ammonium citrate, iron oxide, manganous oxide, cobalt carbonate, copper oxide, zinc oxide. Water is also allowed ad libitum. Thirteen days after arrival, the mice are weighed in groups of ten and assigned at random to the different treatments. Each of the treatments is tested in three replicates, i.e., in three cages of ten mice each.There are ten cages of ten control mice each. Drugs are mixed in the diet at the dosage level indicated. Feed and water are offered ad libitum for a 12 day test period.Feed spilled is collected during the test period. At the end of the test period, the collected feed is weighed, and the mean feed consumption per cage of ten mice is determined for each treatment. The mice are weighed as a group of ten, and the weight gain determined. The mice are sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The right uterine fat pad of each mouse is removed. The fat pads for each cage of ten mice are weighed as a unit. Reduction in fat pad weights of animals is generally indicative of a reduction of total body fat of the treated animals. Moreover, when a significant decrease in body fat is coupled with a marked improvement in weight gain in the treated animals, we have found that the lean meat to fat ratio of said treated animals is substantially improved.
