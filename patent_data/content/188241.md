# IR RADIATION DETECTOR

## Abstract
A thermal imaging detector of the SPRITE type Signal PRocessing In The Element , utilizes four terminals 11, 13, 31, 32 in which readout is achieved in a differential manner across two voltage probes 31, 32 . The two voltage probes 31, 32 are located far enough away from the bias contacts 11, 13 so that the bias contacts do not degrade the spatial frequency response.
