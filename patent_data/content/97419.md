# Valve formed of plastics material and improved actuator therefor.

## Abstract
A moulded polyethylene valve body 12 has a flow passage 18 connecting an inlet 20 with an outlet 22 of the valve body 12 , a valve seat 24 , formed integral with the valve body 12 , surrounds the passage 18 and a plastics valve disc 26 is rotatably positioned in the passage 18 for movement into an out of sealing relation with the valve seat 24 to effect closing and opening of the passage 18 between the inlet 20 and outlet 22 . A valve stem 28 is non rotatably connected at one end to the valve disc 26 and extends through the valve body 12 and projects upwardly therefrom to an upper end portion. An actuator cap 72 is non rotatably connected to the valve stem upper end portion. An external valve neck portion 120 surrounds the upper end portion of the valve stem 28 and is positioned on the outer surface of the valve body 12 . The neck portion 120 is adapted to rotatably receive and support the actuator cap 72 . A pair of clamp like leg members 132,134 of the neck portion 120 extends circumferentially around the surface of the valve body 12 to connect the neck portion 120 to the valve body 12 . Free end portions of the leg members 132,134 are brought under tension to maintain the leg members 132, 134 in gripping engagement with the valve body 12 so that the actuating forces from the actuator cap 72 are transmitted from the neck portion 120 and leg members 132, 134 uniformly around the surface of the valve body 12 .
