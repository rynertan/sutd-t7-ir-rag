## Description
NOVEL CATALYSTS AND TiEIR PREPARATION AND PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF LIQUID PARAFFINS The present invention is directed toward the production of liquid paraffins from synthesis gas. The catalysts and process disclosed are particularly suited for the production of highly branched products with little to no unsaturates and no detectable amounts of oxygenates.Zeolites and Fischer Tropsch catalysts are employed, both of which have been used extensively for the production of hydrocarbon fuels. A method for the synthesis of the catalysts is also provided. The conversion of synthesis gas via FischerTropsch catalysts is a well known process. Such catalysts generally produce liquid products which include components such as organic acids, aldehydes, alcohols and olefins which are undesirable for use as fuels. It is also known to employ zeolite catalysts for the conversion of various organic compounds. For example, U.S. Pats. No. 4,276,438 and 4,278,827 disclose processes for the conversion of aromatic compounds to dialkylbenzene compounds. Each process requires a particular type of zeolite catalyst which has been modified with either a Group IB or a GroupIVB metal. U.S. Pat. No. 3,775,501 discloses a process for the production of aromatics from hydrocarbons and air over a zeolite catalyst. U.S. Pat. No. 3,271,418 discloses a process for cracking petroleum gas oil to produce high octane gasoline over a zeolite catalyst where the original alkali metal has been repl lcod by other cations. Others have disclosed the use of Fischer Tropsch catalysts with zeolites in organic synthesis. U.S. Pat.No. 4,279,830, for instance, discloses a two reactor process for converting synthesis gas to oxygenates and hydrocarbons by reducing CO in the first reactor over aFischer Tropsch catalyst, where a zeolite is optionally present, followed by treatment in the second reactor over a zeolite catalyst. U.S. Pat. No. 4,269,783 discloses a process for the conversion of synthesis gases to hydrocarbon mixtures such as olefinic naphtha with an aromatic content of less than 20 weight percent. The oleo in plus aromatic content of such products comprises at least 50 weight percent. The zeolite component of the catalyst combination comprises not more than 0.5 weight percent alkali metal. Lastly, U.S. Pat. No. 4,086,262 discloses a method for the conversion of synthesis gas to hydrocarbon mixtures rich in aromatics. A heterogeneous catalyst comprising zeolites and Fischer Tropsch synthesis catalysts is employed. Thus, while the art provides catalysts and processes for the conversion of synthesis gases and other organic feedstocks to various hydrocarbons over mixtures of zeolite and Fischer Tropsch catalysts, it has not disclosed the specific production of liquid paraffins in high yields at relatively low temperatures and with no detectable amounts of oxygenates and unsaturates. DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a process for producing highly branched liquid paraffins from synthesis gas. It is another object of the present invention to provide a novel catalyst for converting synthesis gas to highly branched liquid paraffins. It is still another object of the present invention to provide a method for the preparation of a combination catalyst for the conversion of synthesis gas to highly branched paraffins. These and other objects, together with the advantages thereof over the prior art, which shall become apparent from the specification which follows, are accomplished by our invention as hereinafter described and claimed. The catalyst of the present invention comprises a medium to large port zeolite modified with a reducible metal salt of an element selected from the group consisting of Group VIII, IB or IIB elements and, a Fischer Tropsch catalyst wherein the ratio of zeolite to Fi scher Tropsch component is from about 0.1 to 50 1. The process of the present invention produces liquid paraffins from synthesis gas and includes the step of contacting synthesis gas having a ratio of hydrogen to carbon oxides of from about 0.1 to 10.0 1 over a combination catalyst at a reaction temperature of from about 1000C to 500 C and at a pressure of from about one atmosphere 0.1 MPa to about 200 atmospheres 20 MPa and at a gas hourly space velocity of from about 10 to 100,000. The combination catalyst itself comprises a medium to large port zeolite modified by a reducible metal salt of a GroupVIII, IB or IIB element and, a Fischer Tropsch catalyst wherein the ratio of zeolite to Fischer Tropsch component is from about 0.1 to 50 1. A method is also provided for the preparation of a combination catalyst for the conversion of synthesis gas to liquid paraffins. It includes the steps of modifying a medium to large port zeolite with a metal salt of an element selected from the group consisting of Group VIII, IB and IIB and combining the modified zeolite with a FischerTropsch catalyst in a ratio of from about 0.1 to 50 1. The method can include as further steps the calcining of the modified zeolite at temperatures ranging from about 1000 to about 8000 C for at least one hour, prior to the combining of the zeolite and Fischer Tropsch components, and reducing the combination catalyst with H2 and or CO at a temperature of from about 1000 C to 6000 C, at H2 and or CO partial pressures ranging from 0.001 MPa to about 5,07 MPa and for a period of time of from about one to 100 hours prior to employing the catalyst for the conversion of synthesis gas. The catalyst and process for its use results in a high yield of low boiling point highly branched paraffins.The process is run at relatively low temperatures and olefins and oxygenates are essentially eliminated unlike the existing art where these are often produced. PREFERRED MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION The catalyst of the present invention comprises a mixture or combination of a Fischer Tropsch catalyst and a medium or large port zeolite which has been modified with a reducible metal salt of a Group VIII, IB or IIB element. The zeolites capable of use in this invention include medium port zeolites and large port zeolites.Examples of medium port zeolites include ferrierite, chabazite, erionite, ZSM 5 U.S. Pat. No. 3,702,886 andZSM ll U.S. Pat. No. 3,709,979 . Examples of large port zeolites include mordenite, zeolite X U.S. Pat. No.2,882,244 and zeolite Y U.S Pat. No. 3,130,007 . The foregoing list is exemplary only and is not intended to be limiting. A more complete description of the man made zeolites can be found by referring to the cited patents, the subject matter of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Pore opening diameter of such zeolites range from about 4 up to about 10 A. The zeolites may be used in a variety of cation exchange forms, preferably where the cations are NH , H , Na , Li , K , Cs , Rb , Ag and other monovalent cations. Zeolites with divalent and trivalent metals as cations are less preferred, but still are possible suitable forms. The zeolites are then modified by exchange and or impregnation with metal salts of Groups VIII, IB or IIB of the Periodic Table. Introduction of zero valent metals, such as by vapor deposition, is also a suitable way of introducing the metal into onto the zeolite. Metal concentration in the zeolite can range from 0.01 to 20 weight percent and preferably is from 0.1 to 10 weight percent. The metal loaded zeolite is subsequently dried and calcined at temperatures between 100 and 8000 C and preferably from 300 to 6000 C. The calcined zeolite is then combined with a supported or unsupported FischerTropsch catalyst, which includes any such catalyst known in the art, either as an intimate mixture or as separate particles. The Fischer Tropsch catalysts include all of those generally known in the art. The catalysts employed in the examples were prepared according to the methods outlined in 11The Fischer Tropsch and Related Syntheses by H. H. Storch, N. Golumbic and R. B. Anderson, JohnWiley and Sons, Inc., 1951 the contents of which are incorporated herein by preference. The ratio of zeolite to Fischer Tropsch component may be from 0.1 to 50 1, preferably between 1 to 10 1.When the two components are combined as an intimate mix ture, the powders of the components greater than 30 mesh are combined and thoroughly mixed in the desired ratio and a lubricant such as graphite can be added to the mix. One to two weight percent based upon the total catalyst weight is also sufficient. The mixture is then pressed into pellets or wetted and extruded, followed by drying and calcination. Pelleted catalysts are broken into 10 30 mesh particles before placement into the reactor. The catalyst is finally placed in the reactor and the Fischer Tropsch component activated in a known manner such as by reduction with hydrogen, carbon monoxide or a combination with or without the presence of a diluent such as nitrogen. Reduction conditions are chosen to optimize the activity of the particular Fischer Tropsch component present in the catalyst. They normally include heating to a temperature of at least 1000 C up to about 6000 C atH2 and or CO partial pressures ranging from 0.001 MPa to about 5.07 MPa and for a period of time of from about one to 100 hours. In the process of the present invention, syn thesis gas, i.e., a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, in a ratio of 0.1 to 10 1 H2 CO and preferably 0.5 to 4 1H2 CO, is reacted in the presence of the novel catalyst in the vapor phase to form principally highly branched liquid paraffins. The conversion can be conducted in either fluid bed or fixed bed reactors, the latter being exemplified herein, and the process is applicable to continuous or batch type operation. The reaction temperature should be maintained between temperatures of from about 1000 to 5000 C, preferably from about 1500 to 3500 C. Pressures may be from ambient to about 200 atmospheres 20 MPa , preferably from ambient to about 30 atmospheres 3 MPa . Synthesis gas space velocities can range from about 10 to 100,000 GHSV, or volumes of gas passed over one equivalent volume of catalyst per hour, and preferably from about 100 to 10,000GHSV. Products of the synthesis gas conversion resulting from practice of the present invention include highly branched liquid paraffins, the majority of which boil below 204e C, the cut off for good gasoline grade fractions. No measurable olefins or oxygenates are produced. Such liquids are useful as a blending stock for gasoline. In the examples reported hereinbelow, a catalyst of the present invention was prepared in a two step process as follows Step I Two grams of NH3 4Pd Cl2 was dissolved in about 300 ml of water. The solution was added to 100 gms ofLinde zeolite Y 72 LZY 72 Na form powder was added to the first solution and the resulting mixture was heated to about 600 C and stirred for four hours. The solution was cooled to room temperature and stirred overnight. The zeolite was then filtered and was combined with 2.0 gms of NH3 4Pd Cl2 in 300 ml of water. The new solution was stirred for 24 hours after which the zeolite was again filtered. One gram of additional NH3 4Pd Cl2 was dissolved in 200 ml of water, the zeolite was added and stirred for four hours.The zeolite was again filtered, washed with 500 ml of water and dried on the frit. The zeolite was then dried and calcined at 5000 C for four hours. The modified zeolite contained 2.0 weight percentPd and has been designated Pd LZY 72 in the work which follows. A similar modified zeolite was prepared according to the procedure set forth in Step I but with 100 gms ofLinde zeolite Y 82 LZY 82 NHt form powder in place ofLZY 72. The modified zeolite obtained contained 2.3 weight percent Pd and has been designated Pd LZY 82 in work hereinbelow. Step II Two parts of the calcined Pd LZY 72 powder thus prepared, was combined with one part of a Fischer Tropsch catalyst comprising 100Co 8MgO 5ThO2 100 kieselguhr. The solids were thoroughly mixed together and with 2 weight percent graphite. The mixture was pelleted, broken into 10 to 30 mesh particles and calcined at 5000 C for four hours.The catalyst formed is one of the present invention and is designated as Catalyst A. Two parts of the calcined Pd LZY 82 powder was also combined with one part of the Fischer Tropsch catalyst comprising 100Co 8NgO 5ThO2 100 kieselguhr. The solids were thoroughly mixed together and with 2 weight percent graphite. The mixture was pelleted, broken into 10 to 30 mesh particles and calcined at 5000 C for four hours.The catalyst formed is one of the present invention and is designated as Catalyst B. Catalyst A was reduced and then run in a fixed bed reactor for the conversion of synthesis gas as follows 20 cc of Catalyst A was placed in a fixed bed reactor and pressurized to 0.7 MPa. 300 SCCM standard cubic centimeters of H2 was passed over the catalyst while it was heated to 4000 C, where the temperature was held constant for 17 hours, after which the reactor was cooled. The bath temperature was set to 2250 C and the pressure was increased to 1.04 MPa. Flows of 50 SCCM CO and 50 SCCM H2 were introduced and a 151 minute run was conducted. A volume contraction of 54.6 percent was observed and 0.24 grams of organic liquid was produced per hour. Gas chromatographic analysis of the liquid showed it to be highly branched. The C10 component, for example, was greater than 3 1 branched to straight chain. NMR analysis showed no functional groups to be present indicating a completely saturated product. The CH2 CH3 ratio of the organic was 1.6. Next, flows of 100 SCCM H2 with 50 SCCM CO were passed over the catalyst. The bath temperature was lowered to 2160 C and a 1058 minute run was conducted. A gas contraction of 37.2 percent was observed and 0.29 gms of organic liquid was produced per hour. Gas chromatography again showed the sample to be highly branched, and NMR showed the presence of only saturated products. TheCH2 CH3 ratio observed was 2.2. A simulated distillation analysis of the organic resulted in an average boiling point of 1590 C, while 74 percent of the liquid boiled below 2040 C, the cut off for the gasoline boiling range. Additional synthesis gas conversions were run over the catalyst of the present invention in the manner just set forth and the results of all conversion are reported in the tables which appear hereinbelow. For purposes of comparison with the catalysts of the present invention, three catalysts not part of the present invention and designated as C, D and E were also prepared by combining an unmodified zeolite with aFischer Tropsch catalyst following the procedure of Step II hereinabove. The description of the preparation of each is as follows Catalyst C 1 part LZY 82 NH analog of LZY 72 which had been calcined to give the H form and 1 part of 100Co 5ThO2 8MgO 200 kieselguhr were mixed and pelleted using the same procedure as Step II. Catalyst D 3 parts LZY 82 calcined and 1 part 100Co 5ThO2 8MgO 200 kieselguhr were mixed and pelleted as inStep II. Catalyst E 1 part HZSM 5 SiO2 A1203 70 and 1 part 100Co 5ThO2 8MgO 100 kieselguhr were mixed and pelleted as inStep II. Catalysts C E were also reduced and then run in a fixed bed reactor for the conversion of synthesis gas as follows 20 cc of Catalyst C was placed in the reactor and pressurized to 0.7 MPa with H2. 300 ervM of H2 was introduced and the system was heated to 40Or C and maintained for 17 hours. The pressure was reduced to ambient and flows of 50 SCCM H2 and 50 SCCM CO were fed at a bath temperature of 225 C. A run was conducted for 1178 minutes and a contraction of 29.4 percent was observed with production of 0.07 grams of liquid organic product per hour. The liquid contained olefins in the amount of 34.8x10 4 moles per gram and aromatics at 2.1x10 4 moles per gram. The CH2 CH3 ratio of the organic liquid was 2.6. 20 cc of Catalyst D was placed in the reactor.and pressurized to 0.7 MPa with H2. 300 SCCM of H2 was introduced and the system was heated to 4000 C and maintained for 16 hours. The pressure was increased to 1.04 MPa and flows of 50 SCCM of H2 and 50 SCCM of CO at a bath temperature of 2400 C. A run was conducted for 1172 minutes and a contraction of 65 percent was observed with production of 0.5 grams of liquid organic product per hour.The liquid contained olefins in the amount of 26. 0x10.. 4 moles per gram and aromatics in the amount of 0.95x10 4 moles per gram. The CH2 CH3 ratio observed was 2.5 and the boiling point average from simulated distillation was 1730C with 66 percent boiling below 2040 C. 20 cc of Catalyst E was placed in the reactor and pressurized to 0.7 MPa with H2. 300 SCCM of H2 was introduced and the system was heated to 4000 C and maintained overnight about 16 hours . The pressure was increased to 1.04 MPa and flows of 50 SCCM H2 and 50 SCCM CO were introduced at a bath temperature of 2110 C. A run was conducted for 969 minutes with 51.1 percent contraction observed, with the production of 0.37 grams of organic liquid produced per hour. The liquid contained 47x10 4 moles per gram of olefins and the average boiling point was 1820 C and 62 percent of the organic boiled below 2040 C, with a CH2 CH3 ratio in the sample of 3.1. The H2 flow was then increased to 100 SCCM overCatalyst E and the oven temperature was cut back to 2040 C and a run of 1405 minutes conducted. The observed gas contraction was 67.7 percent and 0.35 grams of organic liquid was produced per hour. The product contained 9.9x10 4 moles per gram of olefins. The observed CH2 CH3 ratio was 3.7 and the average boiling point was 1810 C and 61 percent of the product boiled below 2040 C. As the foregoing examples show, Catalyst A produced the lowest boiling product, the most branching and the least amount of undesirable products. A separate catalyst apart from the invention was also prepared for comparison with Catalysts A and B of the present invention, wherein Pd was co precipitated with the other component metals of the Fischer Tropsch catalyst.This catalyst is designated as Catalyst F and was prepared in a similar fashion as the Co Fischer Tropsch catalysts set forth hereinabove but with the addition of Pd NO3 2 to the solution of metal salts. More particularly, the method of preparation of the Co Fischer Tropsch catalysts presented herein has been set forth in Storch, et al Id. The modification of the Fischer Tropsch catalysts was made by adding the appropriate amount of Pd NO3 2 to the metal nitrate solution which was then co precipitated with the other metals. The modified Fischer Tropsch catalyst was then combined with 50 percent LZY 82 following the procedure otherwise set forth in Step II. Catalysts A and B were next compared further against Catalysts C, D and F as well as three conventionalFischer Tropsch catalyst compositions which did not contain any zeolite. The comparison catalysts included the following Cobalt Fischer Tropsch catalysts alone over different supports Cobalt Fischer Tropsch catalyst with zeolite, 50 50 mixture Catalyst C Cobalt Fischer Tropsch catalyst with zeolite, 25 75 mixture Catalyst D CobaltFischer Tropsch catalyst containing palladium with zeolite, 50 50 mixture Catalyst F Cobalt Fischer Tropsch catalyst with palladium modified zeolite, 33.3 66.7 mixture LZY 72 PdCatalyst A and LZY 82 Pd Catalyst B .More specifically, the catalysts employed were as follows Examples No. 1 6 100Co 5ThO2 8MgO 200Kieselguhr on alundum Examples No. 7 8 100Co 5ThO2 8MgO 200Kieselguhr lOcc 10cc glass beads Examples No. 9 11Catalyst C 50 100Co 5ThO2 8MgO 200Kieselguhr 50 LZY 82 Examples No. 12 16Catalyst D 25 100Co SThO2 8MgO 200Kieselguhr 75 LZY 82 Examples No. 17 20Catalyst F 50 100Co 10MgO 5ThO2 2Pd 100Kieselguhr 50 LZY 8 Examples No. 21 23Catalyst A 33.3 100Co 8MgO 5ThO2 100Kieselguhr 66.7 LZY 72 Pd Examples No. 24 27Catalyst B 33.3 100Co 8MgO 5ThO2 100Kieselguhr 66.7 LZY 82 Pd In each series of examples, 20 cc of a specific catalyst was selected, placed in the reactor after appropriate reduction of its Fischer Tropsch component and then subjected to multiple runs with increasing time being reported in Table II.

In Table III, it is seen that Catalysts A and B produced neither olefins nor oxygenates while Catalysts C,D and F as well as the Fischer Tropsch catalysts were particularly high in olefins. Catalyst F, it will be recalled comprised palladium in the Fischer Tropsch component rather than the zeolite and although no oxygenates were produced, the presence of olefins was significant. In this respect, Catalyst F was not different from Catalysts C and D no palladium demonstrating that the metal is not inherently effective but rather, its incorporation into the zeolite portion of the combination catalyst is. It is also to be noted from Table III that the volume of organic liquids boiling below 2040 C was greatest with Catalysts A and B and that the best lowest CH2 CH3 ratios were also obtained. The methylene to methyl ratio can be utilized to determine the chain length or extent of branching. For instance, comparing the ratio of a straight chain C6 6 paraffin 7 1 to that for a Ce paraffin 3.0 1 it appears that the longer chain has the higher number. However, when a C6 paraffin is branched, such as iso octane the ratio becomes 1 5 or 0.20, from which it is evident that branching lowers the ratio considerably. By comparing the CH2 CH3 number with boiling point fraction data, i.e., SIMDIS simulated distillation , volume average boiling point and percent boiling under 2040C, the usefulness of the product as a gasoline former or as gasoline can also be determined. Inasmuch as greater chain length increases the CH2 CH3 ratio while branching decreases it and longer chain compounds have higher boiling points, a ratio of about 2.5 coupled with a high percent of materials boiling under 2040 C, is indicative of a good gasoline former while a value of 2.0 is excellent. Finally, with respect to Table IV, it will be seen that Catalysts A and B generally produced from small amounts of olefins Examples 22 and 25 to none Examples 23, 26 and 27 . Branching, on the other hand, was significant as exemplified by the Cq and C5 range of products. Based upon the satisfactory yields of liquid paraffins, particularly branched species, the minimal amounts of olefins and lack of oxygenates that have been obtained when the catalysts of the present invention have been employed in the process set forth herein, it should be apparent that the objects of the invention have been met.It is to be understood that the catalysts of the present invention can be modified with other reducible metals fromGroups VIII, IB or IIB than palladium. Similarly, otherFischer Tropsch catalysts can be employed. It should be apparent to those skilled in the art that the process of the subject invention is operable with catalysts having fairly broad ratios of modifier to zeolite and of zeolite to Fischer Tropsch catalyst and that the process is operable when other temperatures, pressures and times are employed. Similarly, parameters for the preparation of the catalyst can be varied from those which have been exemplified. It is to be understood that these variables fall within the scope of the claimed invention and that the subject invention is not to be limited by the examples set forth herein. These have been provided merely to demonstrate operability and, therefore, the selection of specific catalyst components and process conditions can be determined without departing from the spirit of the invention herein disclosed and described. Moreover, the scope of the invention shall include all modifications and variations that may fall within the scope of the attached claims.
