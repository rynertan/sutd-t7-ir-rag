Further, it is described in the abovesaid patents that the second electrode F Therefore the photoelectric conversion device of the abovesaid patents has the defect of low photoelectric conversion efficiency. A similar photoelectric conversion device to that disclosed in the aforesaid patents is disclosed in GB A 2095908 and, as with the case of the first mentioned device, the device of GB A 2095908 is formed in a manner which takes no account of the problems arising from delamination of the second electrode F The applicants are also aware of WO A 8300409 which was published on 3 February 1983, namely after the earliest claimed priority date 24 November 1982 of the present application, but does itself claim the earlier priority date of 16 July 1981. The disclosure of W0 A 8300409 is thus to be considered as comprised in the state of the art in accordance with Article 54 3 EPC in respect of the subject matter of the first and second Japanese patent applications from which the present application claims priority, and as comprised in the state of the art in accordance with Article 54 2 EPC in respect of the subject matter of the remaining four Japanese applications from which the present application claims priority. Disclosed in W0 A 8300409 are solar cells and arrays of solar cells made as thin films on insulating substrates. In a first embodiment configured as an individual photoelectric conversion device, by use of masking techniques a thin conductive film is deposited on a glass substrate, a semiconductor film incorporating a P N junction is deposited on top of the conductive film, a second conductive film is deposited on top of the semiconductor film, and contacts are made to edges of the conductive films. In a second embodiment, an array of such cells is made by shifting the mask between successive deposition steps so that an edge of the second conductive film of one cell overlaps an edge of the first conductive film of an adjacent cell for connecting the cells in series. Mention is made in W0 A 8300409 of forming one or other of the conductive films as discrete films of ITO indium tin oxide and gold.

The embodiment of the photoelectric conversiodn device of the present invention shown in Figs. 1 to 3 has a plurality n n being an integer larger than one of photo semiconductor elements U₁ to U The substrate 1 has an insulating surface 2. The substrate 1 may be a light transparent substrate made of glass, organic synthetic resin or the like, or a flexible sheet as of organic synthetic resin. It is also possible to employ a non light transparent substrate of ceramics, organic resin or the like, a non light transparent metal substrate having its surface insulated, or a flexible, insulating sheet like member having an insulating film formed on the surface of a flexible metallic sheet. The substrate 1 is, for example, rectangular in shape and 20 cm wide and 60 cm long.

When the flexible metallic sheet like member is made of aluminum or an aluminum base alloy, the abovesaid oxide film is an aluminum oxide alumina Al₂O₃ or an insulating material consisting principally of the aluminum oxide. The oxide film has a thickness small enough not to impair the flexibility of the flexible metallic sheet like member, for instance, in the range of 0.1 to 2 µm, preferably, 0.3 to 1 µm.
