# Process for removing heavy metals from aqueous media.

## Abstract
Heavy metals, particularly cadmium, are removed from very acid and hot monocalcium phosphate digestion liquors by adding an aromatic or heterocyclic dithiocarbamate, preferably in the form of a solid alkaline earth metal salt, and separating off the organic heavy metal complex formed. So it is possible to produce virtually heavy metals free monocalcium phosphate solutions, which can be converted to purified phosphoric acid and purified calcium sulphate.

## Description
PROCESS FOR REMOVING HEAVY METALS FROM AQUEOUS MEDIA The invention relates to a process for removing heavy metals, particularly cadmium, from acid, phosphate containing, aqueous media by adding to these a sulphur containing compound and separating off the heavy metal compound formed. Such a process is known for removing cadmium and other heavy metals from wet process phosphoric acid, in which process the sulphurcontaining compound added is an inorganic sulphide and the insoluble heavy metal sulphide formed is separated off. This process is described, for instance, in the Japanese patent applications 53 110.997, 53 75.196, 50 75.115 and 54 67.597, as well as in the International PCT patent application 80.02418. A disadvantage of this known process is that, in consequence of the low concentration of heavy metals in the solution, the growth is only extremely slow, and that, in consequence of the low rate of growth of very poorly soluble sulphides, a colloidal precipitate is formed that is hard to be separated off. Moreover, in applying these processes the toxic and ill smelling hydrogen sulphide will be formed. Another disadvantage of the processes mentioned, which occurs in a wet process phosphoric acid process, is that the problem of the extremely toxic heavy metals is eliminated only partly. The fact is that the portion of the heavy metals incorporated in the calcium sulphate obtained as byproduct in such a process is not removed by applying these known processes. As known in the art, the content of toxic heavy metals in this calcium sulphate constitutes a serious obstacle for the discharge or storage of the calcium sulphate, and certainly for the technical use thereof, for instance in the building industry. The invention now provides a process in which the said disadvantages are wholly or substantially eliminated. This is achieved according to the invention in that the heavy metals are removed from a monocalcium phosphate solution having a pH 1, having a temperature of between 60 and 145 OC, a P205 content of 28 52 wt and a CaO content of 3 5.5 wt obtained by dissolving phosphate rock in an excess of wet process phosphoric acid, by adding to said monocalcium phosphate solution a dithiocarbamate having the general formula EMI2.1 where R1 and R2 represent the same or different, substituted or nonsubstituted aromatic or heterocyclic rings, or where R1 and R2 form part of a ring structure together with nitrogen, X represents hydrogen, ammonium, an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal, and n is either l or 2, corresponding with the valency of X, said dithiocarbamate being added in a quantity of 1 25 gram moles per gram atom of heavy metals present in said monocalcium phosphate solution, and separating off the organic heavy metal complex formed. It has been found that in this way it is possible for the heavy metals present in the digestion liquor to be substantially separated off, so that, in further processing this liquor to form phosphoric acid, a purified calcium compound is obtained in addition to a purified phosphoric acid. Although the present process could in principle be applied to any liquor obtained by treating phosphate rock with a strong mineral acid, such as HN03, RCl and or H3P04, the process is directed to treat a monocalcium phosphate solution obtained by dissolving phosphate rock with an excess of wet process phosphoric acid. Such a solution can advantageously be processed to form phosphoric acid by adding concentrated sulphuric acid to it and separating the precipitated calcium sulphate from the phosphoric acid solution formed. Preference is given to subsequently returning part of this phosphoric acid solution for dissolving phosphate rock. As such a monocalcium phosphate solution has a certain heavy metal content, for instance 2 20 ppm Cd, 3 ppm Cu, about 20 ppm Ti and varying quantities of Pb, Hg and As, a phosphoric acid and a calcium sulphate contaminated with heavy metals are normally obtained in further processing. Although in principle it seems possible to treat such a monocalcium phosphate solution with an inorganic sulphide in order thus to precipitate the heavy metals present as insoluble sulphides, this has been found in practice not to be feasible. When dissolving phosphate rock in an excess of phosphoric acid, a very high temperature must be applied, generally 60 145 OC, more specifically 75 125 OC, in order to obtain an acceptable CaO content of the final monocalcium phosphate solution. In this process a very acid solution results pH 1 , with a high temperature 60 145 OC, specifically 75 125 C , having a high P201 content 28 52 wt , specifically 42 47 x wt and a high CaO content 3 5.5 wt .It has been found that in such extreme conditions no precipitate of heavy metal sulphides is formed, but a colloidal sulphide extremely difficult to be separated off. Moreover, there is an intensified formation of fl2S. In the present invention, in which a specific dithiocarbamate is used as a heavy metal binding agent, the said formation of colloid and H2S does not occur, not even in the said hot, acid environment of a monocalcium phosphate solution. The dithiocarbamates used in the present process are known and can be prepared on the basis of the corresponding amines and carbon disulphide, see for instance Methoden der Organischen Chemie Rouben Weyl , 4th edition, volume IX 1955 , pages 823 827. In the present process the dithiocarbamates can be used in theH form and as ammonium or alkali or alkaline earth metal salt. As in the said synthesis applied the dithiocarbamates can be easily obtained as alkali metal salts, particularly sodium salt, advantageously an alkali metal , particularly sodium dithiocarbamate may be used. As it however appeared that the alkali metal salts are easily oxidised to the inactive disulphides so that often an oxidation ratarder has to be added, preference is given to use the less oxidation sensitive alkaline earth metal salts, particularly the calcium and barium salts. In the present process various dithiocarbamates can be used.An example of a compound in which R1 and R2 form a ring structure is N pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate An example of a compound in which R1 and R2, represent heterocyclic rings is dipyridyl dithiocarbamate. It has been found that dialkyl and dicycloalkyl dithiocarbamates do indeed show a good binding capacity for heavy metals, but at higher temperatures they will decompose while metal sulphides are being split off, so that is has become impossible to recover the compound used originally. Therefore, in the present process where the solution to be treated has a very high temperature, no dialkyl or dicycloalkyl dithiocarbamates can be used. It has been found that dithiocarbamates in which both hydrocarbyl groups represent an aromatic hydrocarbon ring are so stable that even at the extremely high temperatures and very low pH of a monocalciumphosphate solution there will be no decomposition. Preference is therefore given, in the present process, to using a dithiocarbamate in which both hydrocarbyl groups represent an aromatic group. Examples of such groups include phenyl, benzyl, toluyl and naphthyl, which may or may not be substituted, for instance with one or more alkyl , amino , nitro , nitroso , carboxyl , hydroxyl , mercapto and or sulphoric acid groups.The dithiocarbamate used is preferablyN,N diphenyldithiocarbamate, because this has been found to be very stable, to show a very high bonding capacity for heavy metals and to be capable, moreover, of being synthesized in a fairly simple manner. The quantity of dithiocarbamate to be added may in principle vary, but depends, of course, on the quantity of heavy metals in the solution to be treated. The dithiocarbamate is generally used in a molar excess in respect of the heavy metals present Cd, Pb, As, Cu, Ti, Hg, U, Y, rare earth metals . Particularly 2 6 gram moles dithiocarbamate are used per gram atom heavy metals present. The dithiocarbamates can be used in the form of a solution, e.g. with a concentration of between about 0,5 to 10 Z wt , or in solid form. It has been found that in the process according to the invention, especially when a solution of a dithiocarbamate is used, the organic heavy metal complexes formed do not precipitate completely, but will partly remain in solution in consequence of the extremely acid environment and the high temperature. According to one mode of realizing the process according to the invention, these complexes are precipitated by adding to the liquor subjected to the treatment one or more organic metal complexes, which will result in a coprecipitate of heavy metal complex and the metal complex added. Examples of suitable metal complexes are dithiocarbamates of copper, titanium, vanadium and zinc. Optionally, these complexes may be formed in situ from the metals present in the digestion liquor or added thereto and dithiocarbamate. Another possibility is, after the separation, to return part of the cadmium complex formed. Copperdiphenyldithiocarbamate has been found to be a particularly suitable coprecipitating agent. The quantity of coprecipitating agent may vary within wide limits, for instance 2 ppm or more calculated in respect of the digestion liquor to be treated. According to another mode of realization, the heavy metal complex is precipitated by adding an organic ligand to the liquor subjected to the treatment. Examples of suitable organic ligands are substituted or non substituted diphenyldithiooxalates.Preference is given to use a polymeric dithiooxalate as organic ligand. It has been found that for this purpose particularly suitable are dithio oxalate polymers having the general formula EMI5.1 where n represents a whole number higher than or equalling 3. The quantity of organic ligand to be added is not critical.Generally 10 40 wit calculated in respect of the dithiocarbamate is applied. According to a third mode of realization the heavy metal complex is precipitated by converting it into the corresponding insoluble thiuramdisulphide complex. This conversion can be effected by adding an oxidizing agent, for instance potassiumpermanganate, to the liquor subjected to the treatment. It has been found that a heavy metal complex precipitate can be obtained directly by adding the dithiocarbamate to the liquor in solid form. This addition of solid dithiocarbamate can be effected in ore or more, for instance in three, steps. Preferably the solid dithiocarbamate is added in a plurality of steps and the precipitate formed is separated off after each step before the next addition of dithiocarbamate taking place. It has been further found that an even greater part of the cadmium present can be removed if an inorganic anion generating compound is added too to the monocalcium phosphate solution.Preferably said compound is added to the solution before the addition of the dithiocarbamate. Examples of suitable inorganic compounds are metalbromides, iodides, sulphites, thiosulphates and sulphamates. The precipitate thus obtained can be separated from the liquor in various ways, for instance by decantation, filtration, centrifugation. Preference is given to separate the precipitated metal complex off by means of a pressure filter. The complex thus separated off can be carried off as such.However, it is possible also for the dithiocarbamates used to be recovered from this complex, for instance by suspending the complex in a polar solvent, for instance water, and subsequently extracting it with an organic solvent, such as toluene, benzene or xylene, in which process the heavy metal stays behind in the polar phase and the dithiocarbamate passes into the organic phase. From this the dithiocarbamate can be recovered, for instance by evaporation. The dithiocarbamate thus recovered can subsequently be used again as complexing agent for heavy metals. The invention wil be further elucidated in the following examples without, however, being restricted thereto.Example IExperiment 1 At a temperature of about 80 0C 3 ml of a 1 Z wt aqueous solution of sodium diphenyldithiocarbamate was added, during stirring, to 20 ml of a monocalcium phosphate solution with a f205 content of 47 Z wt , a pH of 1 and a Cd content of 20 ppm. This sodium diphenyldithiocarbamate had been obtained according to the process described in example IA. A polarographic analysis revealed that practically all cadmium was complexed. The liquor was subsequently filtered at about 80 OCI Through extraction with toluene it was found that practically all cadmium was left behind in the filtrate.Experiment 2 The process of experiment 1 was repeated, on the understanding that the temperature applied was 90 OCI The results were the same as those of experiment 1.Experiment 3 The process of experiment 1 was repeated, on the understanding that the dithiocarbamate used was sodium diethyldithiocarbamate. The liquor took on a yellow colour and hydrogen sulphide escaped. Through polarographic analysis it was found that there had been hardly any complexing of cadmium.Experiment 4 The process of experiment 3 was repeated, on the understanding that the temperature of the liquid to be treated was 50 C. The liquid showed no discolouration and no hydrogen sulphide escaped. The results of the analysis were the same as those of experiment 1.Experiment 5 8 The process of experiments 3 and 4 were repeated, on the understanding that the dithiocarbamate used was sodium dimethyl, respectively sodium dipropyldithiocarbamate. The results were the same as those of experiments 3 and 4. The above mentioned results show that at a relatively low temperature to about 50 OC the aliphatic dithiocarbamates are suitable for complexing cadmium from monocalcium phosphate solutions, but decompose at higher temperatures. It is further found that in the extremely acid medium the diphenyldithiocarbamate is still stable at a temperature of 90 0C and suitable for complexing cadmium.Example IA 8.5 grammes diphenylamine was dissolved in 18 grammes carbon disulphide. The resulting mixture was cooled on an ice bath and subsequently, during intensive stirring, a quantity of 2.1 grammes sodium amide was added slowly. The mixture was subsequently stirred for about 30 minutes more, during which stirring a solid substance crystallized out. The product crystallized out was sucked off, washed with water and subsequently recrystallized from water. The resulting product had a melting point of 92 0C and was found on analysis to consist of more than 99 of sodium diphenyldithiocarbamate.Example II Experiment 9 The process of experiment 1 was repeated, on the understanding that 5 ml of a phosphoric acid solution with a P205 content of 47 wt , containing 120 ppm metals Rg, Cu, Cd, Zn, Ni and Fe , was added also to the solution to be treated. On analysis it was found that practically all cadmium was complexed, but that the complex had remained in solution.Experiment 10 The process of experiment 9 was repeated, on the understanding that 6 ml of the dithiocarbamate solution was dosed. On analysis it was found that almost all cadmium was complexed, and that more than 70 Z of the total cadmium was filtered off. The above mentioned experiments 9 and 10 show that coprecipitation of the complex does occur provided the quantity of ligand dosed is such that the other metals, too, are capable of complexing.Experiment 11 25 ml of a monocalcium phosphate solution with a P205 content of 47 wt , a pH of about 1 and a temperature of 80 OC, containing about 20 ppm Hg, 20 ppm Cu, 20 ppm Cd, 20 ppm Zn, 20 ppm Ni and 20 ppmFe, was treated in the manner described in experiment 1. On analysis it was found that, although the quantity of diphenyldithiocarbamate was insufficient to catch all metals, about 70 of the cadmium had been caught.Example IIIExperiment 12 The process of experiment 1 was repeated on the understanding that 2 ml of a 1 wt aqueous suspension of a dithiooxalate polymer prepared according to the process described in Example IIIA was added to the liquor as well. On analysis it was found that more than 70 of the cadmium had been caught.Experiment 13 The process of experiment 12 was repeated, on the understanding that 5 ml of a metals containing phosphoric acid solution as described in experiment 9 was also added to the liquid to be treated. On analysis it was found that about 70 of the total cadmium content had been caught.Example IIIA 1 mole dry oxalylchloride was cooled and subsequently 2 moles thiophenol was slowly added in drops. After some time a yellow precipitate crystallized out, which was filtered off and recrystallized from ethanol. The sulphur yellow product melting point 119 120 C was found to consist of S,S diphenyl 1,2 dithiooxalate. To this a stoechiometric quantity potassium hydrosulphide dissolved in water was added, during which addition potassium dithiooxalate crystallized out. The product was washed with ethanol, subsequently dissolved in water and polymerized by oxydation with an excess of a 3 wt R202 solution.Example IVExperiment 14 The process of experiment 1 was repeated, on the understanding that 2 ml of a 1 wt aqueous solution of potassium permanganate, too, was added to the liquor. The solution showed a discolouration from light brown, via blue and dark green, to deep brown. Using infrared spectroscopy, it could be shown that the diphenyldithiocarbamate had been converted into diphenylthiuramdisulphide. On analysis it was found that more than 70 of the cadmium had been caught.Example VExperiment 15 60 mg solid sodium diphenyldithiocarbamate was added, during stirring, to 50 ml of a monocalcium phosphate solution with aP205 content of 47 wt , a pH of 1 and a temperature of about 90 C, containing 60 ppm Cd. After 0,5 hour the liquor was filtered and the filter cake extracted with toluene. On analysis it was found that about 10 of the cadmium has been caught. Experiment 16 The process of experiment 15 was repeated, on the understanding that in order to prevent oxidation of the dithiocarbamate, 1 ml of 1 wt aqueous solution of oxalic acid was added as well. On analysis it was found that 25 Z of the cadmium has been caught.Experiment 17 The process of experiment 15 was repeated, on the understanding that 60 mg solid calcium diphenyldithiocarbamate was added. The quantity of cadmium caught was now 70 .Experiment 18 The process of experiment 15 was repeated using 60 mg solid barium diphenyldithiocarbamate. The quantity of cadmium caught was now 68 Z. Experiment 19 The process of experiment 17 was repeated starting from a monocalcium phosphate solution containing 10 ppm Cd. The quantity of cadmium caugt was now 67 .Experiment 20 The process of experiment 18 was repeated starting from a monocalcium phosphate solution containing 22 ppm Cd. The quantity of cadmium caugt was 72 . From the above experiments 15 20 it can be concluded that the barium and calcium salts are far less oxidation sensitive than the sodium salt, and moreover far more effective in catching cadmium.Example VIExperiment 21 The process of experiment 16 was repeated, on the understanding that 60 mg solid sodium p methyl diphenyl dithiocarbamate obtained according to the process described in example VIA was added. The quantity of cadmium caught was now 65 . Experiment 22 The process of experiment 21 was repeated on the using a monocalcium phosphate solution containing 10 ppm Cd. The quantity of cadmium caught was now 62 .Experiment 23 The process of experiment 16 was repeated on the understanding that 60 mg solid sodium dipyridyl dithlocarbamate obtained according to the process described in example Vl B was added. The quantity of cadmium caught was now 29 .Example VI A 4,6 grammes p methyl diphenylamine was dissolved in 50 ml n hexane, whereafter the solution was purified by passing through of nitrogen. During intensive stirring a quantity of 1.0 gram sodium amide was added slowly, whereafter the mixture was boiled for about 15 minutes under reflux cooling. After cooling the mixture 25 ml carbon disulphide was added in drops at room temperature. The reaction mixture was stirred for about 16 hours at room temperature with passing through of nitrogen, wherafter the solid substance formed was sucked off and recrystallized with ethylacetate, next with acetone and finally again from ethylacetate. The resulting product had a melting point above about 280 0C and was found on analysis to consist of more than 85 of sodium pmethyl diphenyl dithiocarbamate.Example VI B 8,5 grammes dipyridylamine was dissolved in 50 ml boiling dioxane under reflux cooling, whereafter the solution was purified by passing through of nitrogen.During intensive stirring 2,0 grammes sodium amide was added slowly, after which the mixture was boiled for about 2 hours under reflux cooling. Thereafter a small amount of 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16 hexa oxacyclooctadecane was added, the mixture for about 5 hours boiled under reflux cooling, and cooled to room temperature whereafter 25 ml of carbon disulphide was added in drops. The resulting reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for about 16 hours with passing through of nitrogen. The product formed was sucked off and washed with dioxane. The resulting product had a melting point above 200 0C and was found on analysis to consist of more than 90 Z of sodium dipyridyldithiocarbamate.Example VII Experiment 24 30 mg solid sodium diphenyldithiocarbamate was added, during stirring, to 50 ml of a monocalcium phosphate solution with aP205 content of 47 Z wt , a pH of 1 and a temperature of about 80 C, containing 5.3 ppm Ni, 4.0 ppm Cu, 3.68 ppm Cd, 19.8 ppm Cr, 25.2 ppmTi, 32.2 ppm Zn and 14.5 ppm Be. In order to prevent oxidation of the dithiocarbamate, 1 ml of 1 Z wt aqueous solution of oxalic acid was added as well. After 1 hour the liquor was filtered and the filter cake was extracted with toluene. On analysis it was found that 44 Z of the cadmium had been caught.Experiment 25 The process of experiment 24 was repeated, on the understanding that 50 mg solid dithiocarbamate was added.
