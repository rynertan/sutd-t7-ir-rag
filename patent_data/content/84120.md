# Holographic optical system.

## Abstract
An optical system comprises a composite block made of a bonded assembly of unit glass blocks, some of which are coated with a thin film on selected surfaces to provide predetermined light transmission characteristics, lenses, and a recording material. Other glass blocks are spaced apart from the composite block. A thin substrate is provided having recesses in which the respective blocks are to be fixed. The entire optical system is embedded in a transparent molding material.
