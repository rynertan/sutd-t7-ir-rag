# A reinforced structural support member.

## Abstract
A reinforced structural support member comprises a wooden beam 10 having a groove 14 of predetermined depth extending longitudinally along a surface 16 thereof. An unstressed reinforcing rod 12 is adhered within the groove 14 to increase the strength of the beam under the stress and to reduce deviation of strength between beams.
