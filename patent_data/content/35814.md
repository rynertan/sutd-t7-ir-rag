# An exhaust system especially for use in the cast house of a blast furnace.

## Abstract
In a cast house of a blast furnace, one or more movable exhaust hoods 1,2 connected to exhaust ducts, are provided for extraction of gas and dust. In order to provide such a hood which is easily moved manually by the operating personnel but which, with its duct, nevertheless does not unduly obs truct the working space, the hood is carried by a swivellable duct 3,4 section which is connected to a fixed duct section 5 at its swivelling axis and is supported, in cantilever fashion, by bearing 13, 15 , e.g. a ball bearing, which is located outside the duct and extends circumferentially around the duct.
