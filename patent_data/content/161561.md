# Gas turbine combustor with pneumatically controlled flow distribution.

## Abstract
A combustor for a gas turbine including a burner defining an axial fluid flow path between upstream and downstream ends, a burner casing coaxially surrounding the burner and de fining an annular conduit for inlet gas flow from downstream to upstream ends of the burner, ports for introducing part of the inlet gas into the upstream end of the burner, a fuel nozzle in troducing fuel into the upstream end of the burner, slots cir cumferentially disposed around the burner casing upstream of the ports and a conduit and valve arrangement for introducing external air to the annular conduit through the slots to gene rate an annular vortex to restrict inlet gas flow to the ports when the turbine is operating at predetermined operating con ditions.
