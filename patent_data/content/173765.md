# Prefabricated unit for the construction of immobile floating platforms.

## Abstract
A slab 6 is joined by means of pillars 2, 3, 4, 5 to the top of a buoy 1 . The weight of the entire unit and the volume of the buoy 1 are such that the level of free floating 7 of the unit is between the top and the bottom of the buoy 1 . The height of the pillars 2, 3, 4, 5 is greater than the expected maximum height of waves in the region where the unit has been installed. The unit is anchored by means of ropes 12, 13, 14, 15 under tension so that it is kept submerged to a level 20 which is above the top of the buoy 1 and below the slab 6 . At this position and for loads up to the difference of the buoyance of the buoy minus the weight of the entire unit and minus the weight of the ropes 12, 13, 14, 15 the unit remains immobile despite the existence of waves or fluctuations of the load it is bearing.

## Claims
CLAIMS l.Prefabricated unit for the construction of immobile floating platforms consisting of a slab 6 joined by means of pillars 2,3,4,5 to the top of a buoy 6 , wherein rings 8,9,10,11 are provided for the anchoring of the unit, characterised in that the volume of the buoy and the weight of the entire unit are such that the line of free floating 7 of the unit is between the top and the bottom of the buoy 1 , that the height of the pillars 2,3,4,5 is greater than the expected maximum height ol the waves in the region whsre the unit has been installed and that the horizontal cross section of the pillars 2,3,4,5 is substantially smaller than the horizontal cross section of the buoy 6 . 2.

## Description
PREFABRICATED UNIT FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF IMMOBILE FLOATING PLATFORMS C The invention relates to prefabricated unit for the construction of immobile floating platforms for use in sea and lake waters,consisting of a slab joined by means of pillars to the top of a buoy wherein rings are provided for the anchoring of the unit. To date, similar constructions for use in water have been founded on the seabed.Floating and yet immobile structures have not, to date, been described. The existing floating units can be used only bur structures where vertical movement can be tolerated. Construction with foundations on the bottom of a lake or on the seabed entails very high costs, especially in deep waters. Moreover, the progress of the construction is often hindered by local wheather conditions resulting in even higher costs and longer times of completion. The invention,as claimed, overcomes these drawbacks.It solves the problem of how to construct speedily and at low cost an immobile floating platform by use of floating prefabricated units specifically designed to be unaffected by waves. The advantages offered by the invention are mainly low cost and high speed of construction. One way of carrying out the invention is described in detail below with reference to the attached drawing which illustrates only one specific embodiment, in which Figure 1 is an axonometric view of a unit in operation in accordance with the invention. The unit consists essentially of a slab 6 joined by means of pillars 2, 3,4,5 to the top of a buoy 1 wherein rings 8,9,10,11 are provided for the anchoring of the unit through ropes 12,13,14,15 to anchoring elements 16,17,18,19 . The volume of the buoy and the weight of the entire unit are such that the free floating level 7 of the unit is situoted between the top and the bottom of the buoy.The following requirements must be met for the proper functioning of the unit a. The unitmtst be kept submerged to a level 20 above the top of the buoy 1 and below the slab 6 , preferably around midheight of the pillars 2,3,4,5 , in order to achieve that the ropes 12,13,14,15 ore under tension. b.The height of the pillarsuit,tbe greater than the maximum expected height of the waves in the region where the unit has been installed. c. The horizontal cross section of the pillars must be substantially smaller than that of the buoy. d. The buoyance of the buoy l minus the weight of the entire unit and minus the weight of the ropes 12,13, 14, 15 must be greater than the maximum expected load to be borne by the unit. If these requirements have been met the unit will remain immobile regardless of the presence of waves or fluctuations of the load exerted on the unit. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, the unit has fastening means 21,22,23,24 for the joining of units together in any desired fashion.
