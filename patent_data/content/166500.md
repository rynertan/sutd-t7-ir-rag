# An apparatus for manufacturing a compound semiconductor single crystal by the liquid encapsulated czochraiski LEC process.

## Abstract
A compound semiconductor single crystal manufactur ing apparatus comprises a crucible 20 for holding a molten raw material of GaAs 81 and a liquid capsule element of B₂O₃ 82 , a holder 30 for said crucible 20 a heat element 50 concentrically surrounding the crucible 20 , and a heat shield ing unit 60 surrounding the heat element 50 , thereby manufacturing a GaAs single crystal 84 by progressively pull ing it up from the molten raw material 81 held in the crucible 20 by the liquid encapsulated czochralski LEC process, and wherein the heat shielding unit 60 and crucible holder 30 are formed by molding a sintered aluminum nitride AlN el ement.
