# METHODS FOR IMPACT AND VIBRATION DAMPING AND ARTICLES THEREFOR

## Abstract
This invention relates to a method of and devices for impact and vibration damping and, more particularly, to devices composed of an elastoplastic material including the characteristics of damping, heat and pressure dimensional stability, and moisture non absorbency of a blend of polyolefin and conjugated diene butyl rubber which converts impact shock or vibration energy into thermal energy.
