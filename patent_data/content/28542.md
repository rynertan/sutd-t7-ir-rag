# Method and apparatus for steam sterilization.

## Abstract
In steam sterilization systems which use steam flow through a sterilizing chamber 50 to facilitate air removal, chamber pressure is held substantially constant while chamber temperature is measured. Venting of chamber atmosphere is continuous during such control of chamber pressure with chamber temperature being measured until the actual temperature value reaches the steam saturation temp erature in accordance with steam tables at the value of the chamber pressure being held. With complete removal of the air ascertained, sterilizing exposure conditions can be established rapidly by substan tially reducing venting of chamber atmosphere since any remaining portions of the cycle, whether establishing or maintaining sterilizing exposure conditions, need not be relied on for removal of air. Control apparatus, electromechanical and electronic pro cessor, may be provided for automatically completing air removal and ascertaining effective air removal.
