# PROCESS FOR ELECTROLYTICALLY REMOVING METAL DEPOSIT FROM A NON PLATED SURFACE OF A SINGLE SURFACE PLATED METAL STRIP

## Abstract
In a process for electrolytically removing metal deposit from a non plated surface of a single surface plated metal strip, by bringing, within an electrolytic liquid, a single sur face plated metal strip which serves as an anode plate, into a location at which the non plated surface of the anode single surface plated metal strip faces in parallel to and is spaced from a cathode plate, and by applying a principal voltage between the anode metal strip and said cathode plate to electrolytically remove metal deposit from the non plated surface whereby undesirable stripping of portions of the plated metal layer in side edge portions of the plated surface of the metal strip is prevented by arranging sup plementary anode plates within the electrolytic liquid in such a manner that the supplementary anode plates face in parallel to and are spaced from side edge portions of the plated surface of the anode metal strip, and then, while the principal voltage is applied between the anode metal strip and the cathode plate, a supplementary voltage is applied between the supplementary anode plates and the metal strip, the electric potential of each supplementary anode plate being higher than that of the metal strip.
