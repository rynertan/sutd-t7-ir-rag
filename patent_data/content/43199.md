# Zero insertion force electrical connector.

## Abstract
A zero insertion force electrical connector including a first housing part 16 having cavities 102 receiving a series of contacts 14 comprising first and second arms 62 and 64 integrally joined at root ends 72 and 76 and having opposed contact surfaces at free ends 72 and 76 defining sockets. The second arm 64 has an intermediate portion 78 of sinuous shape having successive elements 78a, d, b, e, c extending longitudinally and laterally of the contact arm 64 which provide both torsional and bending stress compo nents when flexed. A second housing part 10 is mounted for sliding movement on the first housing part 16 to move the contact surface of the second arm 64 away from the first arm 62 to admit a lead into the socket with zero insertion force.
