# A method of manufacturing level vials.

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing level vials involving a. Moulding a core 1 having the required barrel like shape of an opaque thermoplastic material around a pin, in a conventional double injection moulding machine. b. Transferring said core 1 into a suitable mould in the same machine and moulding the vial body 8 of transparent thermoplastic material around it, c. After cooling, removing said body 8 and withdrawing first said pin from the core 1 and then said core 1 from the body the softening temperature of said transparent plastics being lower than that of the opaque plastics.
