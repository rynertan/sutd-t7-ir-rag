# Copper alloys having an improved combination of strength and conductivity.

## Abstract
A copper base alloy having an improved combination of conductivity and strength for applications such as lead frames or electrical connectors. The alloys consists essentially of from about 0.3 to 1.6 by weight iron, with up to one half the iron content being replaced by nickel, manganese, cobalt, and mix tures thereof from about 0.01 to about 0.20 by weight mag nesium from about 0.10 to about 0.40 by weight phospho rus up to about 0.5 by weight tin or antimony and mixtures thereof and the balance copper. The phosphorus to magne sium ratio and phosphorus to the total content of phosphide formers ratio are maintained within critical limits.
