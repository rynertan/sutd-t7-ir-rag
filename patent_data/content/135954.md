## Description
TANTALUM V HALIDE OXIDE METAL OXIDE CCMPOSITIONS The invention relates to a camposition containing a tantalum V halide, to a process for the preparation of such compositions, to a process for the alkylation of an alkylatable hydrocarbon and to a process for the oligomerization of olefins in the presence of such compositions. The tantalum pentahalides are useful catalysts in various organic reactions, as described in, for example, Friedel Crafts andRelated Reactions , Volume 1, G.A. Olah, Ed., Interscience, 1963,New York. A means of providing tantalum pentahalide distributed over a support would be very useful, both from an economic and a handling point of view. The main problem to date in distributing tantalum pentahalides over a support is that they are basically only soluble in solvents in which they react and thus the usual techniques of impregnation to obtain a metal loading of tantalum pentahalide cannot be utilized. It is an object of the present invention to provide compositions having a loading of tantalum V halide over the surface of a metal oxide substrate. It is another object of the invention to provide hydrocarbon conversions which are catalyzed by the said compositions. Accordingly, the invention provides a composition containing a tantalum V halide, characterized in that it comprises pentavalent tantalum, halogen, oxygen and a metal oxide substrate wherein at least one valence of tantalum is bound to an oxygen atom which is bound to the substrate, at least one valence at the tantalum is bound to a halogen atom and the retraining tantalum valences are bound to halogen andtor oxygen atoms which may or may not be bound to the substrate. Pentavalent tantalum is also written herein as tantalum V . The compositions according to the invention are novel and are useful as catalysts. The invention further provides a process for the preparation of the novel compositions, which process comprises reacting a substantially anhydrous metal oxide substrate containing surface hydroxyl groups with one or more tantalum pentahalides in the vapour state. A preferred method of preparation is to sublime one or more tantalum pentahalides and react the vapour therefrom in a substantially anhydrous and oxygen free atmosphere with a substantially anhydrous metal oxide. Preferred oxides are aluminium oxide gels, silicon oxide gels and silicon aluminium oxide gels. With halogen1 is meant fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine and mixtures thereof. Preferred halogens are fluorine and chlorine. The metal oxides that are useful as substrates to prepare the compositions of the instant invention are those inorganic oxides which have hydroxyl groups attached to the surface of the substrate.The hydrcxyl groups provide the means by which the tantalum pentahalides are bound by reaction to the surface of the substrate.The scope of the invention is broad and any metal oxides which have surface hydroxyl or oxyhydroxyl groups can be utilized in preparing the compositions. The term metal oxide , although used herein in the singular tense, is meant to include the single oxides such as silica, or alumina as well as plural and complex oxides such as silica alumina silica alumina thoria, zeolites and clays. The preferred metal oxide substrates used to prepare the instant compositions are the porous solid inorganic oxides which contain surface hydroxyl groups and which are conventionally used as catalysts and catalyst supports. Non limiting examples of these types of materials include those containing more than 50 by weight of silica or alumina or a mixture of silica and alumina, such as, for example, alumina and aluminous materials, silica and siliceous materials clays, particularly open lattice clays and crystalline aluminosilicates zeolites .Non limiting examples of aluminous and siliceous materials include, for example, silica alumina, silica magnesia, silica zirconia, silica titania, aluminachromia, alumina ferric oxide, alumina titania as well as ternary compositions such as, for example, silica alumina titania, silica alumina zirconia, etc. Non limiting examples of crystalline aluminosilicates useful as substrates include synthetic zeolites such as, for example, A, X, Y,L and ZSM types such as ZSM 5 and others and naturally occurring zeolites, such as erionite, faujasite, itcrdenite, sodalite, cancrinite and others. Non limiting examples of open lattice clays useful as substrates include bentonite, montmorillonite and others.In a preferred embodiment, the metal oxide should contain silica or alumina or a mixture thereof in a weight percentage of more than 50. Particularly suitable as substrates for preparing the instant compositions are those solid inorganic oxide compositions known as metal oxide gels or gel oxides. The gel oxides which are particularly suitable for use in preparing the compositions of the instant invention are any of the metal oxide gels that are well knawn in the catalytic art useful as either catalyst base materials or as promoting materials in catalyst compositions. Additionally, the term metal oxide gel or gel oxide as used herein shall also include the plural oxide gels, i.e., those that contain mixtures or compounds of two or more rretal oxides.A metal oxide gel is basically a metal oxide that contains chemically bound water in the form of hydroxyl groups or oxyhydroxyl groups as opposed to adsorbed water and water of hydration, although adsorbed water and water of hydration may also be present. They are typically prepared by the precipitation of the metal component 5 in an aqueous medium. Upon calcination at sufficiently elevated temperatures, water is given off and the gel is converted to the oxide with two hydroxyl pieties giving one molecule of water and an oxygen is attached to a metal ion. Illustrative of gel oxide base materials used to prepare the composition of this invention are aluminas, silicas, alumina silicas, alumina zirconias, silica zirconias and the like, including naturally occuring hydrous oxide materials such as clays, such as, for example, the kaolinites, the montmarillonites and the like. Among the clays the open lattice clays are particularly desirable.Also included are the zeolites, both natural and synthetic. The structure of the gel oxides can range from amorphous to highly crystalline. Preferred oxide gel materials are selected from the group consisting of alumina, silica, alumina silica, crystalline aluminosilicates zeolites and open lattice clays. Since the tantalum V halide oxide is bound to the surface of the metal oxide substrate by a reaction of tantalum pentahalide with the metal oxide substrate through a hydroxyl moiety, the metal oxide substrate must have pendant surface hydroxyl groups attached to the surface. Before reaction, the metal oxide substrate must have pendant surface hydroxyl groups, whereas, after reaction, the metal oxide substrate may or may not have surface hydroxyl groups, depending on the degree of reaction with the tantalum pentahalide. Prior to use in preparing the instant compositions the hydroxyl containing metal oxide substrate should be substantially free of absorbed water, i.e., substantially dehydrated or anhydrous . The absorbed or free water is removed by heating the substrate at temperatures ranging from about 100 OC to about 900 OC prior to contact with the tantalum pentahalide vapour. Any environment that provides for drying is suitable such as air, sub attospheric pressure, inert gas such as nitrogen, etc. The dried metal oxide substrate should be kept away from a humid atmosphere after drying. It is understood that a dried metal oxide substrate prior to use in preparing the instant compositions will still contain chemically bound water in the form of hydroxide and oxyhydroxide. An aluminium oxide gel is one of the preferred substrates. This alumina can be any of the variety of available aluminas. These are commercially available under various names such as alumina gels, activated aluminas, gamma aluminas, etc. Regarding purity of the alumina, it may be stated that small amounts of impurities are not generally detrimental, and may be beneficial when the impurity is present as a co gel. In fact impurities may be purposely added for catalytic effects. The following table lists several commercial aluminas and their properties which are found suitable.

Grace Co. U.S. Sieve Series A.S.T.M. E 11 61 Other preferred substrates are the aluminosilicates. These materials contain various mixtures of aluminium and silicon oxides.They are readily available comeercislly and are generally employed as cracking catalysts. Typically they contain from about 50 to about 95, preferably from about 70 to about 90 per cent by weight of silica. Illustrations of commercially available alumina silicas areDavison Grade 980 25 manufactured by Davison Chemical Division,W.R. Grace Co. which contains about 75 SiO2 and 25 A1203 andDavison Grade 980 13 which contains about 87 SiO2 and 13 Al2O3.These materials can be prepared in a conventional fashion, as for example by co precipitation, co gellation, or by spray drying. Encompassed within the term aluminosilicates are most of the zeolites. The zeolites are found to be specifically useful as substrates.Zeolites are ordered, porous crystalline aluminosilicates having a definite crystalline structure within which there are a large number of small cavities which are interconnected by a number of still smaller channels. Zeolites useful as substrates may be either synthetic or natural. At least 34 species of zeolite minerals are knawn and the synthetic zeolites number in the hundreds. Any zeolite will be useful as a substrate provided that the zeolite, prior to reaction with tantalum pentahalide, contains chemically bound water in the form of hydroxyl groups. Depending on the state of reaction, the reacted product may contain no hydroxyl groups, if all such groups were reacted with the tantalum pentahalide, or there may be unreacted hydroxyl groups still present. The techniques for the preparation of the tantalum pentahalide intem eidiates are well known in the art and typically are prepared by passing a dry halogen gas over tantalum metal at elevated temperatures. By way of illustration, tantalum pentachloride is prepared by passing dry chlorine over tantalum metal at a temperature above 200 OC. The tantalum pentahalides utilized will comprise tantalum pentafluoride, tantalum pentachloride, tantalum pentabromide and tantalum pentaiodide. The mental oxide tantalum V halide oxide compositions of the instant invention are prepared by a process comprising reacting under substantially anhydrous and oxygen free conditions a suitable metal oxide which has water chemically bound as hydroxyl and which is substantially free from absorbed water with tantalum pentahalide vapour and thereafter recovering the product. The metal oxide compositions thus produced have tantalum V halide oxide bound to the surface thereof. By the term bound it is meant herein that the pentavalent tantalum has at least one valence bound to an oxygen which is part of the metal oxide substrate. By the term surface it is meant both the external and internal pore surfaces which are accessible to the tantalum pentahalide vapour during the preparative process. The tantalum pentahalides readily sublime and thus lend themselves to a preferred method of preparation which is called reactive sublimation wherein tantalum pentahalide is sublimed into an anhydrous, non oxidizing atmosphere and allowed to contact and react with the hydroxyl containing metal oxide. In the preparation of the instant compositions, by reactive sublimation, it is important that the reaction be carried out under substantially anhydrous conditions and in a neutral or reducing environment to prevent decomposition of the tantalum halide. In this preferred method of preparation, the tantalum pentahalide is sublimed by suitable application of temperature and or sub atmospheric pressure into an essentially anhydrous andoxygen free atmosphere where it is allowed to contact and react with a substantially anhydrous, hydroxyl containing metal oxide substrate. Any temperature and or sub atmospheric pressure which causes the tantalum pentahalide to sublime is suitable. Temperatures up to about 200 OC are suitable. Frequently the metal oxide substrate is heated during the reaction, say up to about 200 OC. This heating is not critical to the preparation of the compositions of this invention, but it has been found that by so heating, a more even distribution of the tantalum pentahalide on the metal oxide substrate is effected. After reaction, the metal oxide composition is frequently subjected to an additional period of time at sublimation conditions without the presence of a tantalum pentahalide source. This extra step allows for any unreacted tantalum pentahalide to be sublimed off of the metal oxide composition. The metal oxide substrate before use is frequently subjected to a heat treatment to remove absorbed water.Sub atmospheric pressure can also be applied. Generally, if the pre treatment temperature is too low, free water will remain, and, if the temperature is too high, sintering of the metal oxide substrate will occur, both of which can adversely affect the catalytic properties of the composition. Generally, the most desirable pre treattent temperatures of the metal oxide substrate range from about 200 to about 400 OC. It is postulated that when tantalum pentahalide reacts with the hydroxyl group of a metal oxide substrate, that the reaction may be illustrated variously as follows using chloride as an illustrative halide EMI9.1 In the final composition a mixture of the above described reaction products will exist. The distribution of these reaction products is believed to be affected by reaction conditions, such as temperature. Analysis of chlorine tantalum ratios in compositions containing about 8 17 wt of tantalum shaw Cl Ta atomic ratios of from about 2.5 1 to about 3.5 to 1. Thus, depending on the tantalum content desired in the final composition, a tantalum pentahalide vapour is reacted with the hydroxyl containing metal oxide substrate until a part or the thole of the hydroxylgroup population of the metal oxide substrate is exhausted. It will be apparent that products having varying tantalum contents will be suited for various purposes. Thus, the tantalum pentahalide may be reacted with the hydroxyl containing metal oxide substrate in such amounts as is necessary to prepare products which are suitable for the particular purposes. The reaction between the tantalum pentahalide vapour and the hydroxyl containing metal oxide substrate is carried out at temperatures ranging from about roan temperature to elevated temperatures, say to 150 200 C or higher. The reaction is normally carried out in an anhydrous, i.e., free from water vapour, atmosphere. The atmosphere should further be a neutral or reducing atmosphere i.e., oxygen free. Dispersal of the tantalum pentahalide vapour at sub atrospheric pressure provides a quite suitable atmosphere for reaction with the metal oxide substrate. The metal oxide tantalum V halide oxide compositions of the instant invention may be produced in virtually any physical form, as for example, they may be pellets, beads, extrudates, microspheres and in other particular forms, as for example rings, saddles and the like and in porous or non porous form. The compositions are generally prepared by a process which comprises contacting the hydroxyl containing metal oxide substrate in a substantially anhydrous state with tantalum pentahalide in the vapour state and allowing the vapour to react with the substrate in an atmosphere which is substantially oxygen and water free. In the preferred process, sublimation of the tantalum pentahalide is used to put the tantalum pentahalide in the vapour state. Tantalum pentachloride is the preferred sublimation agent, producing the highest metal loadings on the metal oxide substrate. A variation of the above process is utilized to produce a composition containing mixed halides, particularly mixed chlorides and fluorides. In this variation a tantalum V chloride oxide metal oxide composition is prepared by reactive sublimation. The tantalum V chloride oxide metal oxide composition is then contacted with an oxygen containing gas or a chemical compound containing oxygen which is weakly covalently bonded to the compound. It is postulated that oxygen replaces part of the halide of the composition.The material is then reacted with a liquid or gaseous fluorinated hydrocarbon which is believed to react preferentially with the oxygen bound only to the tantalum, producing, it is postulated, a composition containing various mixtures of chlorides, fluorides, oxides, oxychlorides, oxyfluorides, oxychlorofluorides, etc., depending on reaction conditions. Analyses of compositions prepared in this fashion show that they contain varying amounts of chlorine and fluorine along with amounts of oxygen not bound to the substrate ranging from insignificant to mcderate, depending on the degree of fluorination obtained using the fluorinated hydrocarbon. The amount of oxygen remaining can be varied by choice of fluorinated hydrocarbon and reaction conditions.Reaction temperatures and pressures for the reaction with the fluorinated hydrocarbon are not critical. Temperatures of room temperature or greater are generally suitable. Different fluorinated hydrocarbons will have different optimum temperatures, pressures and times of contact, and these can readily be determined by routine experimentation. Particularly suitable fluorinated hydrocarbons are the Freons, such as, for example Freon 12 CF2C12 , Freon 14 CF4 , Freon 23 CHF3 , Freon 112 CC12F CC12F , Freon 116 CF3 CF3 , Freon 142 CF2C1CH3 , Freon C138 octafluorocyclobutane and similar materials Freon is a trade mark .One particular advantage of this process is that it allows for the preparation of compositions containing higher amounts of fluoride than does the process using reactive sublimation of tantalum pentafluoride alone. Compositions containing the fluoride are more resistant to oxygen degradation than the compositions containing chloride alone. Thus, when the mixed chloride fluoride compositions are used as catalysts, the feeds need not be purged of oxygen and air is no longer a poison. Feeds containing oxygen e.g., 02 peroxide, etc. , however, will still compote for catalyst sites and, hence, the observed rates of reaction can be reduced. As noted above, a modification of the basic composition of the instant invention can be obtained by contacting the tantalum V halide oxide metal oxide compositions with oxygen or a compound containing oxygen which is weakly covalently bonded to said compound. Illustrative of said compounds are the peroxides and peroxy compounds, both organic and inorganic, the hypohalides etc.It is postulated that contact of the instant compositions with oxygen or the indicated oxygen containing compounds converts part of the halogen on the composition to oxygen which is not bound to the substrate. Thus, there are two possible types of oxygen bound to the pentavalent tantalum of the composition. One type is the oxygen s which is bound to the tantalum and to the substrate. This presence of this type of oxygen is required to produce the compositions of the instant invention. The other type of oxygen which optionally may be present is oxygen bound only to the tantalum of the composition.Thus, at least one valence of pentavalent tantalum is bound to oxygen which is bound to the substrate, at least one valence of the tantalum is bound to halogen and the remaining tantalum valences are bound to halogen and or oxygen which is or is not not bound to the substrate. This modification containing the optional oxygen may be effected either inadvertantly or purposefully. It may be effected by contact with oxygen or oxygen containing compounds present as additives or impurities in feed streams when the compositions are used as catalysts. For many reactions the instant compositions provide for very active catalysts. When these very active catalysts are used in packed bed flow reactors, they can lead to hot spots and reactor runaway. The activity of the catalyst can be moderated by contact with oxygen or oxygen containing compounds as described above. The compositions of the instant invention find particular utility as catalysts for hydrocarbon conversion, such as, for example, alkylation reactions, isorrerization reactions, oligarri zation reactions, etc. The invention, furthermore, provides a process for the alkylation of an alkylatable hydrocarbon, characterized in that the alkylatable hydrocarbon is caused to react with an olefin in the presence of a composition according to the invention. The invention, moreover, provides a process for the oligonerization of olefins of the following general formula R1R2C,CR3R4 wherein R1, R2 and R3 each individually represent a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms and R4 represents an alkyl group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, unless all ofR1, R2 and R3 represent hydrogen atoms, than R represents an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, with the proviso that any two of 1 R2, R3, and R4 may form a divalent alkylene moiety having 2 to 20 carbon atoms, to higher olefinic oligoners, characterized in that the process is carried out at a temperature in the range of from 10 OC to 350 C in the presence of a composition according to the invention. Olefin oligomers such as those encompassed by the instant process find use commercially as chemical intermediates. They are, for example, converted to lubricating oil additives or detergent alcohols. They also find use as gasoline fuel additives for increasing the octane number of gasoline. Conventional processes for preparing these olefin oliganers utilize as catalysts boron trifluoride and aluminium trichloride.Both of these catalyst types have several disadvantages. They are corrosive to the environment in which they operate. Furthermore, they must be continually added to the reaction system, recovered, and returned to the reaction system. This adds sorre unnecessary cost to the process. The composition according to the present invention used as a heterogeneous catalyst in a fixed bed process alleviates the above described problems The catalysts utilized in the instant process are heterogeneous catalysts with the tantalum halide oxide strongly bound to the metal oxide support. These catalysts experience minImal to insignificant leaching of the tantalum halide into the reactants. Thus, product purity can be maintained at a high level and corrosivity of the reactor and the associated equipment is minimized. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention 1 R2 and R3 each individually represent a hydrogen atom or an 4 alkyl group having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms and R represents an alkyl group having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, unless all of R1, Rê and R3 represent hydrogen atoms, then R4 represents an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms. An illustrative, but not exhaustive list of suitable olefins include l propene, l butene, l pentene, 2 methyl propene, 2 methy 1 1 butene, 2 methyl 2 butene, 2,3 dimethyl 1 butene, 2 methyl 2 pentene, 2 methyl 1 pentene, 2,4,4 trimethyl 2 pentene, 2,4 dimethyl 1 pentene, 2,3,4 trimethyl2 pentene and similar olefinic compounds.Suitable cyclo olefinic compounds include l methyl cyclcprop l ene, l methyl cyclopent 1 ene, 1,4 dimethyl cyclopent 1 ene, 1 methyl cyclohex 1 ene, 1,3, 4 trimethyl cyclohex 1 ene, l ethyl cyclohex l ene, 1 prcpyl 3 methyl cyclohex 1 ene and related olefinic materials. The oligcmerization process is suitably conducted in an inert reaction environment so that the presence of reactive materials such as oxygen is desirably avoided. Reaction conditions are therefore substantially oxygen free. The precise method of establishing olefin catalyst contact is not critical. In one modification, the catalyst composition is charged to an autoclave or similar pressure reactor.The olefin feed is introduced, and the reaction mixture is maintained with agitation at a reaction temperature and pressure suitable for the desired reaction. Another modification comprises passing, in a continuous manner, the olefin reactant through a reaction zone in which a supported catalyst composition is maintained. By any modification, the oligcmerization process is conducted at moderate temperatures and pressures. Preferred reaction temperatures vary from 50 C to 250 OC. The reaction is conducted at or above atmospheric pressure. The precise pressure is not critical, so long as the reaction mixture is maintained substantially in a non gaseous phase. Typical pressures vary from atmospheric to 345 bar with a range from atmospheric, preferably from 6.8 bar to 138 bar being preferred. Inert solvents may be suitably used in the process of the instant invention. Suitable solvents include for example, alkanes, such as, for example, hexane, heptane, octane, and cycloalkanes, such as, for example, cyclohexane and cyclooctane, and the like. The e products are separated and recovered from the reaction mixture by conventional methods such as fractional distillation, selective extraction, filtration, adsorption, and the like. During the instant oligomerization process, the starting olefinic reactant material is converted to dimer, trimer, tetranner, pentamer and higher olefins. The compositions of the instant invention and an illustrative use of these compositions as a catalyst will be further described below by the following Examples which are provided for illustration, and are not to be construed as limiting the invention. SAMPLES EXAMPLE A Catalyst preparation The following illustrates the preparation of a composition of the instant invention. A 200 ml Schlenk flask containing 50 75 g of silica gel Davison 57, 60 100 mesh was heated to 300 OC under a sub atmospheric pressure of ca. 0.13 bar for 16 20 h. The flask was moved into a dry box whereupon 6.5 g of the silica was placed on one side of a fritted Schlenk tube. Tantalum chloride 6.0 g was placed on the other side of the frit. The TaCl5 end of the tube was wrapped with heating tape and then an insulation wrap was installed along with a thernocouple wire. A pressure of ca. 0.13 bar was applied at the end of the silica containing section.The deposition was carried out overnight 16 20 h at 150 OC with the tube mounted horizontally. The siliceous material was removed in a dry box and then subjected to a vertical sublimation in order to remove any condensed but unreacted Tax15. EXAMPLE B Catalyst preparation The following technique has also been utilized to prepare catalyst compositions which are utilized in the instant invention.This is a modification of the above described technique which produces a somewhat more homogeneous catalyst than the above technique and is utilized where uniformity is important. In this preparative technique a gas scrubbing bottle was modified by internally adding a course fritted disc which divided the bottle into an upper section and a lower section. The lower section was fitted with a stoppered connection which allowed it to be charged with tantalum pentachloride and the upper section was fitted with a vacuum stopcock connection which allowed it either to be closed off or connected to a vacuum. To the modified gas scrubbing bottle were added about 20 g of TaCl5 to the bottom section and 60 g of Davison 57 silica 20 30 mesh, pretreated at 300 OC under a pressure of 0.13 bar for 12 24 h to the top section.Both sections were loaded in a dry box containing a hitrogen atmosphere. The bottom section was stoppered and the top section had the sub atmospheric stopcock closed before removing from the dry box. The bottom section of the bottle was immersed into an oil bath and heated at about 150 OC. The top section was wrapped with heating tape and heated to about 150 OC. A pressure of about 0.13 bar was applied at the top of the bottle. The heating and sub atmospheric phase of the preparation was simultaneous and carried out over a period of 18 h. At the end of 18 h, the bottle sub atmospheric stopcock closed was put back into the dry box and 20 g fresh Tax15 was added to the bottom section.The rest of the procedure was then repeated for another 18 h. Then the silica was removed, in a nitrogen filled dry box, and vertically sublimed at 150 OC and 0.13 bar for 18 h. This step was employed to remove any deposited but unreacted TaCl5 on the silica surface. A small amount 260 mg of TaC15 was generally collected on the cold finger of the sublimator. Catalyst compositions prepared as described above were found to contain on the average of about 8 17 w of tantalum and had a chlorine to tantalum atom ratio of about 2.5 1 to about 3.5 1. Similar tantalum V chloride containing compositions were prepared in a fashion similar to the above using as supports a silica alumina Davison 980 25 , an alumina Norton, surface area 200 m2 g and a zeolite Zeolite 4A, Linde . Fluoride, iodide and brcmide compositions were prepared using the reactive sublimation techniques described above with the appropriate tantalum pentahalide as the reactive sublimation agent and silica as the substrate.Tantalum metal loadings on the support were much less when utilizing the iodide, fluoride or bromide than when utilizing the chloride.Tantalum concentrations when utilizing the iodide, fluoride or bromide were less than 1 . Twenty four millilitres of a tantalum V chloride silica composition prepared as described above containing 13.5 Zw Ta, 7.6 wt Cl Davison 57 silica 20 30 mesh was placed in a 150 x 75 rrm crystallizing dish. The dish was allowed to stand in the open atmosphere overnight. This material was added to a fixed bed flow reactor whereupon CF4 Freon 14 was passed through the catalyst at 200 OC, 6.9 bar and a gas hourly space velocity GESV of 240 1 for a period of 2 h. Analysis of the composition of the instant invention by neutron activation indicated that it contained about 15 w Ta, 0.64 w C1 and 0.14 w F. EXAMPLE C Catalyst preparation using air treatment In a variation of the process just described about 24 millilitres of the tantalum V chloride silica composition was added directly to a flow reactor and then subjected to an air flow at 200 OC, 6.9 bar at a GHSV of 10,000 h for 30 min. Then, CF4 Freon 14 was passed through the bed at 200 OC, 6.9 bar and a GHSV 1 of 240 h 1 for a period of 2 h. Analysis of the resultant composition of the instant invention by neutron activation showed it to contain about 15.7 Zw Ta, 3.6 w Cl and 0.40 w F. EXNMPLE D Catalyst preparation using air treatment In another variation of the just described process, 12 millilitres of the tantalum V chloride silica composition was added to a fixed bed flow reactor and treated with air at a flow rate of 4 1 min for 15 min at 6.9 bar and 200 OC. The air treated material was then treated with Freon 12 CF2C12 at 200 C and 4.8 bar at a flow rate of 2.4 l h for 5 h. The flow tube was then sealed and left under an atmosphere of Freon 12 at 200 OC, 5.2 bar for 60 h. Analysis of the resultant composition of the instant invention by neutron activation showed it to contain about 15.7 w Ta, 1.9 w Cl and 5.7 w F. EXAMPLE 1 Alkylation In a dry box, to a 50 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing a stirring bar were added 10 ml of benzene, 0.5 ml of 2 pentene, 0.5 ml of iso pentane as an internal standard and 1 g of the Ta Cl silica composition prepared as described above and containing 14.4 w of tantalum. The reaction was stirred at ambient temperature under ambient atmospheric pressure for 30 min. The reaction mixture was then filtered, and the solution analyzed directly. Analysis of the product showed almost complete conversion of the 2 pentene with a 99 selectivity to pentylbenzene.EXAMPLE 2 Alkylation The above experiment was repeated using 5 ml of benzene, 1 ml of 2 pentene, 1 ml of iso pentane and 0.25 g of the tantalum V chloride composition 2 mol metal concentration basis initial 2 pentene used above.

Catalyst A was a tantalum chloride silica catalyst containing about 13.5 w Ta and 7.6 w C1.Catalyst B was a tantalum chloride fluoride silica catalyst containing about 15.7 w Ta, 3.6 w C1 and 0.40 w F. To test the catalyst, it was loaded into a fixed bed, flow reactor and a mixed olefin feed stream was passed through the catalyst bed at a temperature of 100 OC, a pressure of 6.9 bar and a liquid hourly space velocity LHSV of 10 1. The compositions of the feed stream and the product stream for each of the two catalysts are shown below.

The catalyst contained 12.9 w tantalum. Isobutene was fed to the reactor at a rate of 1.8 g min weight hourly space velocity WHSV of 22 h . The reactor was operated at a pressure of 34.5 bar and a temperature of 50 C or 100 C in an upflow or downy low mode. After two residence times samples were obtained and analyzed. The results are shown inTable I. EXLE3 7 9 Olefin oligomerization The process described in Example 4 was repeated in a similar fashion with l butene and profane as feedstocks.

Remaining 13 selectivity was to 2 butene.c Selectivities to C 6, C 12, C 15 were about 25, 55, 15 and 5, respectively. The liquid obtained from the downy low reaction of the isobutene at 100 C described above was examined as a blending agent for gasoline. This is compared to toluene as a blending agent. The results are shown in Table II. The isobutene oligorrers provide as good a blending agent as toluene.

The reaction conditions were 100 OC, 6.9 bar and an LHSV of 10 h 1. Upon reaction, conversion of C6 was 59 selectivity to C12 was 69 , to C18 was 14 and to C24 was 17 . Analysis of the hexenes in the feed and product stream is shown in Table III. The results show that olefins substituted on the olefinic carbon atoms entries 4, 5, 9 and 10 react much more readily than olefins not so substituted entries 1, 2, 3, 7 and 8 . These isobutene type olefins 4, 5, 9 and 10 are greatly reduced in the product stream due to oligomerization to higher products. The remaining olefins increase due to the selective oligomerization of the isobutene type olefins.
