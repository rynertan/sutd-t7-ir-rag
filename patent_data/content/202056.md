## Description
The present invention relates to an antitumor agent. More specifically, it relates to an antitumor agent containing, as effective ingredients, a pyrimidine type nucleic acid derivative and a 1 2 hydroxy ethoxy methyl uracil derivative. In the antitumor agent of the present invention, the derivatives of 1 2 hydroxyethoxy methyl uracil are used in combination to inhibit decomposition of the pyrimidine type nucleic acid derivatives in living bodies when administered, whereby the utilization efficiency of 5 fluoro 2 de oxyuridine in living bodies can be enhanced to exhibit an antitumor effect at a high level and a low dosage. The pyrimidine type nucleic acid derivative has an excellent antitumor activity in vitro, but a low effectiveness, for example, in oral administration. It has been reported that a pyrimidine type nucleic acid derivative including the acylated derivatives of 5 fluoro 2 deoxyuridine has a higher by 10 to 100 fold antitumor activity in vitro as compared with a pyrimidine base derivative see Cancer Research, 35, 1121 1975 . Furthermore, it has been known in the art that 5 fluoro 2 deoxyuridine is a compound having antitumor activity as one of the methabolites of 5 fluorouracil. Its antitumor activity has been reported to be 100 fold that of 5 fluoro uracil at the same molar concentration, and 10 to 100 fold that of 5 fluorouridine, which is a methabolite of 5 fluorouracil, at the same concentration in inhibitory activity against the proliferation of an established cell line derived from a mouse in vitro see Cancer Res., However, in vivo test using tumor bearing animals, the effect of pyrimidine type nucleic acid derivatives is not sufficient, but contrary to the results in vitro, its antitumor effect has been reported to be inferior as compared with pyrimidine base derivatives such as 5 fluorouracil, and 5 fluorouridine see Cancer Res., Such results are considered to be attributable to the fact that pyrimidine type nucleic acid derivatives such as 5 fluoro 2 deoxyuridine are rapidly decomposed by pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase such as uridine phosphorylase or thymidine phosphorylase in living bodies see Exp. Cell Res., Suppl. For improving this drawback, studies have been heretofore made to chemically modify various pyrimidine type nucleic acids. For example, 3 acyl 5 fluoro 2 deoxyuridine see Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication Kokai No. 54 163586 , 5 fluoro 2 deoxyuridine acylated at the 3 position and at both the 3 and 5 positions Japanese Unexamined Patent Publications Kokai Nos. 56 113795, 56 113796, 56 113797 are known. However, even in these derivatives, a satisfactory improvement is not obtained in potentiation of the antitumor effect. Concerning 3 ,5 diacyl 5 fluoro 2 deoxyuridine, it is shown to have antitumor activity Biochemical Pharmacology, 14, 1605 1965 . Further, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication Kokai No. 58 49315 discloses that said derivative has an antitumor activity at a lower dose as compared with 5 fluoro 2 deoxyuridine. However, since 3 ,5 diacyl 5 fluoro 2 deoxyuridine has a low water solubility, it can be applied for a preparation for injection of the prior art only with difficulty. On the other hand, when it is administered as an oral preparation, it has been reported to have a low antitumor effect, because it is mostly decomposed in the intestine in which esterase and uridine phosphorylase or thymidine phosphorylase activity is markedly greater as compared in other organs Chem. Pharm. Bull., On the other hand, 1 2 hydroxyethoxy methyl uracils have been reported to become inhibitors against uridine phosphorylase in tumor cells and cytosol fractions of tumor cells and mouse liver Biochem. Pharmac., 30, 2097 1981 ibid, Accordingly, enhancement of the antitumor effect of 5 fluoro 2 deoxyuridine by combined use of 1 2 hydroxyethoxy methyl uracils and 5 fluoro 2 deoxy uridine may be considered. However, in this case, even when both may be administered at the same time, it is probable that the behavior of both in living bodies may differ, and therefore, it is not necessarily easy to obtain the effect of the combined use. An object of the present invention is to eliminate the above mentioned problems in the prior art and to provide an antitumor agent capable of improving the behavior of the pyrimidine type nucleic acid derivatives in living bodies and of administering it in the form which can prevent decomposition by uridine phosphorylase or thymidine phosphorylase in living bodies, and an excellent antitumor effect can be expected. Other objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following description. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided an antitumor agent containing, as effective ingredients, i at least one pyrimidine type nucleic acid derivative having the general formula I i.e., component i or component I According to the present invention, the pyrimidine nucleic acid derivatives represented by the formula I and the 1 2 hydroxyethoxy methyl uracil derivatives represented by the formula II substantially coincide with each other in the behavior in living bodies when administered at the same time, and also are substantially the same in the rate of releasing 5 fluoro 2 deoxyuridine and 1 2 hydroxyethoxy methyl uracil. Furthermore, an antitumor activity is not recognized in the 1 2 hydroxyethoxy methyl uracil derivatives represented by the formula II itself, but it can prevent decomposition of the pyrimidine type nucleic acid derivative represented by the formula I in the intestine by potently inhibiting the pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase activity existing in the intestine, thereby enabling oral administration. When both the compound I and the compound II are administered at the same time, while no antitumor activity is recognized in the 1 2 hydroxyethoxy methyl uracil itself released, it can potently inhibit the uridine phosphorylase or thymidine phosphorylase activity existing in living bodies, thereby inhibiting decomposition of 5 fluoro 2 deoxyuridine released at the same time to enhance utilization efficiency and potentiate the antitumor activity. In the pyrimidine type nucleic acid derivatives of the formula I , R¹ and R² may be the same or different and represent hydrogen atom or acyl group. Examples of the acyl group include aliphatic acyl groups having 4 to 24 carbon atoms such as butyryl, hexanoyl, octanoyl, nonanoyl, decanoyl, dodecanoyl, tetradecanoyl, hexadecanoyl, octadecanoyl, nonadecanoyl, eicosanoyl, docosanoyl, tetracosanoyl and the like, or aromatic acyl groups having 7 to 12 carbon atoms such as benzoyl, toluoyl and the like. The acyl group having 8 to 14 carbonatoms e.g., octanoyl, decanoyl, dodecanoyl, tetradecanoyl are more preferable. X in the formula I represents a fluorine atom or a trifluoromethyl group and R³ represents a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl group. In the 1 2 hydroxyethoxy methyl uracils derivatives of the formula II , Y represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a methyl group, a benzyl group, benzyloxybenzyl group, a vinyl group, a nitro group, or an amino group. Here, halogen atoms may preferably include a fluorine atom, iodine atom, chlorine atom, or bromine atom. R⁴ represents a hydrogen atom or an acyl group and preferable examples of such an acyl group include aliphatic acyl groups having 2 to 24 carbon atoms such as acetyl, butyryl, hexanoyl, octanoyl, nonanoyl, decanoyl, octadecanoyl, hexadecanoyl, arachidonoyl, docosanoyl and the like, or aromatic acyl groups having 7 to 12 carbon atoms such as benzoyl, toluoyl and the like. As for the acyl group of R⁴, the acyl group having 16 to 22 carbon atoms e.g., hexadecanoyl, octadecanoyl, eicosanoyl, docosanoyl are more preferable. The pyridimine type nucleic acid derivatives represented by the formula I is a known compound, and these can be prepared in the same or similar manner as the known method see Biochemical Pharmacology, The derivatives of 1 2 hydroxyethoxy methyl uracils represented by the formula II are a known or novel compound and these can be prepared in the same or similar manner as the known method Journal of the Medicinal Chemistry Typical examples of the pyrimidine type nucleic acid derivatives of the formula I to be used in the present invention include the following examples. Typical examples of the derivatives of 1 2 hydroxyethoxy methyl uracil of the formula II to be used in the present invention include the following compounds. In the antitumor agent of the present invention, the combination of the component i in which R¹ and R² are acyl groups and R³ is a hydrogen atom with the component ii in which R⁴ is an acyl group, or the combination of the component i in which R¹, R², and R³ are hydrogen atoms with the component ii in which R⁴ is an hydrogen atom is preferable. In the antitumor agent of the present invention, typical examples of preferable combinations of the component i and the component ii may include the following combinations. In the antitumor agent of the present invention, the proportions of the pyrimidine type nucleic acid derivative represented by the formula I , and the 1 2 hydroxyethoxymethyl uracil derivative represented by the formula II , may vary depending on the compounds selected, but it is generally recommendable to use 0.1 to 20 mols, preferably 0.5 to In the present invention, it is preferable to formulate previously both the compound represented by the formula I and the compound represented by the formula II and incorporate the formulated composition in one preparation to be administered. Also, in the present invention, it is preferable to formulate orally administrable preparations containing both the compounds represented by the formulae I and II . Further, in the present invention, the embodiment comprising a kit of preparations, containing the pyrimidine type nucleic acid derivatives and 1 2 hydroxyethoxy methyl uracil derivatives in separate preparations, respectively, is also included. The antitumor agent of the present invention is preferably in the form of tablets, granules, grains, or capsules filled with granules or grains therein. These preparations can be prepared in a conventional manner by the use of excipients, binders, etc., conventionally used. Examples of the preparation forms of the antitumor agent of the present invention to be administered include orally administratable preparations such as tablets, capsules, granules, pills, powders and liquids as well as parenterally administratable preparations such as aqueous injectable preparations, non aqueous injectable preparations, suppositories, transdermal preparations. Among these preparation forms, orally administrable preparations and suppositories are preferred. These preparations can be prepared according to conventional methods with the use of conventional carriers, excipients, auxiliary agents, binders, lubricants, and disintegrating agents, etc. The antitumor agent of the present invention is particularly preferably in the form of tablets, granules, grains, etc., coated with an enteric soluble substance.

The amount of the derivatives of 1 2 hydroxyethoxy methyl uracil can be determined from the formulation ratio as specified above. The antitumor agent thus obtained comprising active ingredients of pyrimidine type nucleic acid derivatives and a 1 2 hydroxyethoxy methyl uracil derivatives, which is a phosphorylase inhibitor, exhibits high antitumor activities in oral administration and can be used as a pharmaceutical which can exhibit excellent pharmacological activities against liver cancer, gallbladder cancer, stomach cancer, lung cancer, esophagus cancer, colon cancer, kidney cancer, skin cancer, etc. The present invention now will be further illustrated by, but is by no means limited to, the following Test Examples and Examples. The retention time of the compounds of the present invention in reversed phase system high performance liquid chromatograph Lichrosorb RP 18 column was measured in two kinds of solvent systems. The compounds, solvent systems and the retention times of the compounds are shown in Table 1. As can be seen from Table 1, for example, 3 5 didodecanoyl 5 fluorouridine one of the compounds represented by the formula I has substantially the same retention time as 1 2 hexadecanoyloxy ethoxy methyl 5 methyluracil one of the compounds represented by the formula II , and therefore both compounds also have an equal lipid solubility and the behavior in living bodies based on lipid solubility of the compounds may be considered to be similar. The retention times of the compounds of the present invention in normal phase system high performance liquid chromatograph Nucleosil 5 CN column were measured. The compounds, solvent systems and the retention times of the compounds are shown in Table 2. As can be seen from Table 2, for example, 3 ,5 ditetradecanoyl 5 fluoro 2 deoxyuridine one of the compounds represented by the formula I , has substantially the same retention time as 1 2 eicosanoyloxy ethoxy methyl 5 methyluracil one of the compounds represented by the formula II , and therefore, the hydrophilic properties of the both compounds are equal and their behavior in living bodies based on the hydrophilic properties of the compounds may be considered to be the same. The hydrolysis rates of the compounds of the present invention were measured at 37 C in rat duodenum epithelial homogenate 1 , w v pH 7.0 . The compounds and the hydrolysis rate constants are shown in Table 3. As can be seen from Table 3, for example, 3 ,5 ditetradecanoyl 5 fluoro 2 deoxyuridine one of the compounds represented by the formula I has an enzymatic hydrolyzability which is equal to that of 1 2 eicosanoyloxy ethoxy methyl 5 methyluracil one of the compounds represented by the formula II , and therefore, when both compounds are administered to living bodies at the same time, the rates of release of 5 fluoro 2 deoxyuridine and 1 2 hydroxyethoxy methyl 5 methyluracil respectively by the hydrolysis with enzyme systems in living bodies may be considered to be the same. The antitumor effect for mouse leukemia L1210 by a simultaneous oral administration of the compounds of the present invention 3 ,5 didodecanoyl 5 fluoro 2 deoxyuridine and 1 2 octadecanoyloxy ethoxy methyl 5 methyluracil was compared with those of a 5 fluoro 2 deoxyuridine alone, b 3 ,5 didodecanoyl 5 fluoro 2 deoxyuridine alone, and c a simultaneous oral administration of 3 ,5 didodecanoyl 5 fluoro 2 deoxyuridine and 1 2 hydroxyethoxy methyl 5 methyluracil. 10⁵ ascite tumor cells of mouse leukemia L1210 7 days after transplantation were transplanted intraperioneally into mouse 8 weeks, Ca 25 26 g, 5 mice group and provided for experiments. 24 hours after transplantation of the tumor cells, the pharmaceuticals were administered orally three times on day 1, day 3 and day 5. The antitumor effect of the pharmaceuticals were shown by the increase in life span ILS of the group administered with pharamaceuticals relative to the control group with no pharmaceutical administered line extension . The results are shown in Table 4. As can be seen from Table 4, simultaneous administration of 3 ,5 didodecanoyl 5 fluoro 2 deoxyuridine and 1 2 octadecanoyloxy ethoxy methyl 5 methyluracil, which is one combination of the compounds of the present invention exhibited a higher antitumor effect at a lower dose as compared with a single administration of 5 fluoro 2 deoxyuridine or 3 ,5 didodecanoyl 5 fluoro 2 deoxy uridine. Also, the effect was higher as compared with the case when the phosphorylase inhibitor to be administered simultaneously with 3 ,5 didodecanoyl 5 fluoro 2 deoxyuridine is 1 2 hydroxyethoxy methyl 5 methyluracil, which was not converted into an acylated derivative. The pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase activities in homogenates of the small intestine, liver, kidney and plasma of SD strain rats were assayed and compared in phosphate buffers of pH 7.0 containing respective enzyme systems at 37 C with the decomposition rate of 5 fluoro 2 deoxyuridine one of the pyrimidine type nucleic acid derivative represented by the formula I as defined in the claim 1 as the index. The concentrations of the homogenates and the plasma and the decomposition rate constants of 5 fluoro 2 deoxyuridine 10 µg ml are shown in Table 5. As can be seen from Table 5, pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase activity is markedly higher in the small intestine as compared with that in other organs, and this fact markedly restricts the effectiveness of a pyrimidine type nucleic acid derivative in oral administration. Inhibitory effects of 1 2 hydroxyethoxy methyl 5 methyluracil, 1 2 hydroxyethoxy methyl 5 fluoro uracil, 1 2 hydroxyethoxy methyl 5 bromouracil on pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase activity in the small intestine homogenates of an SD strain male rat and a male beagle were assayed with a lowering in decomposition rate of 5 fluoro 2 deoxyuridine concentration 0.025 mM and compared with the same effects of thymidine and deoxyuridine. The results are shown in Table 6. As shown in Table 6, it can be understood that the decomposition of 5 fluoro 2 deoxyuridine in the intestine of a rat and a beagle is inhibited by thymidine phosphorylase, because it is more potently inhibited by thymidine than by deoxyuridine. Also, it can be seen that the 1 2 hydroxyethoxy methyl uracils represented by the formula II in item 1 of the scope of claim for patent inhibit potent inhibitory activity against the thymidine phosphorylase activity and that they are themselves enzymatically stable.
