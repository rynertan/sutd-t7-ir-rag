# Cooling apparatus.

## Abstract
A cooling apparatus comprises a chamber 12 containing a pyrotechnic gas generating composition 10 together with an igniter 14 . When ignited, the gas generated by the compo sition is fed through filters 16 where it is cooled to below the inversion temperature and it is then fed via a heat exchanger 6 to a Joule Thomson effect throttle 4 where its temperature is further reduced. The gas output from the throttle is fed through a cool chamber 2 where liquid gas collects. The outlet from the cool chamber 2 is fed to the heat exchanger 6 where it serves to reduce the temperature of the gas being fed to the throttle increasing the overall cooling effect.
