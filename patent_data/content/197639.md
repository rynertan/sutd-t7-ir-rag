# Semiconductor memory device.

## Abstract
A semiconductor memory device in accordance with the present invention comprises an arrangement in which distances d₁, d₂ and d₃ between an aluminum lead SBL1 connected to a drain of FET of a sense amplifier and an aluminum lead short circuiting a memory cell plate formed outside the sense amplifier array are respectively equal to distances d₁, d₂ and d₃ between adjacent aluminum leads SBL2 and SBL3 . For the purpose of forming the above described arrangement, the shape of the lateral edge of the aluminum lead 3 facing the sense amplifier array is made the same as the shape of the lateral edge of the aluminum lead SBL2 connected to a bit line. Thus, the capacity associated with the lead of the outermost sense amplifier in the sense amplifier array can be made almost equal to the capacity included in each lead in the sense amplifier array and at the time of reading the content stored in the capacity of the memory cell connected to the outermost bit line in the memory cell array, occurrence of an error in reading can be prevented.
