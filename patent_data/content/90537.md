# Non spill liquid fuel tanks.

## Abstract
A liquid fuel tank for a vehicle is provided with a fuel outlet duct in a circuit about the base of the tank and fuel outlet duct vents connected to the outlet duct and extend ing above the highest part of the tank. During normal opera tion of the tank, a non return air vent allows the flow of fuel from the outlet duct. In the event of an accident, or some other occurrence which results in the tank being tilted, further fuel flow from the outlet duct is cut off by air drawn into the fuel outlet duct from the outlet duct vents. The angle through which the tank must be tilted to allow air from the outlet duct vents to be drawn into the outlet duct may be predetermined by the extent of the circuit about the base of the tank of the outlet duct. Such a non spill fuel tank, which is self contained in operation, is suitable for use in on road and off road wheeled and tracked vehicles, hovercraft, and aircraft which are in danger of being blown over when on the ground.
