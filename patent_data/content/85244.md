# Polycaprolactone polymers.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a process for the formation of polylactone polymers which are terminated on one end by a tertiary amine group and on the other end by a hydroxyl group. An Îµ caprolactone is reacted with a diamine in the presence of a catalyst, wherein one of the amine groups of the diamine is a tertiary amine and the other amine group is primary or secondary.
