# Method of strengthening ceramics.

## Abstract
A method of strengthening ceramic material by forming a metal film on the surface of the ceramic material and irradiating ions of high energy on the surface of the film. For further improvement, the material may be heat treated at a temperature of 600 C to 1600 C after the ion irradiation.
