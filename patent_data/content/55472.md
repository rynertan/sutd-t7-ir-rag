# Polyarylate compositions having improved hydrolytic stability.

## Abstract
Described herein are molding compositions comprising a blend of a a polyarylate derived from a dihydric phenol and an aromatic dicarboxylic acid, b a polyester derived from an aliphatic or cycloaliphatic diol and at least one aromatic dicarboxylic acid, c an epoxide and, optionally, at least one thermoplastic polymer. An article molded from these compositions has a good balance of mechanical properties and improved hydrolytic stability.
