# A semiconductor device.

## Abstract
A semiconductor processor for signals such as are conveyed by fibre optics wherein the processor structure accommodates lattice mismatch and minimizes the effect of misfit dislocations. The structure permits using materials having favorable absorption properties at the 1 micrometer wavelength of optical signals. A binary semiconductor is employed with graded regions produced by adding a different third ingredient in two places so that a wide band optically transparent emitter with a graded base and graded collector are provided. The ingredients impart a strong absorption in the optical signal wavelength together with superior semiconductor carrier transit time. A structure for a silicon and germanium oxide based optical signal fibre uses a GaAlAs emitter, a base that is graded to Ga₂₅In₇₅As at the collector and then back to GaAs at the substrate.
