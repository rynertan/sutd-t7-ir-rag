# VALVE DEVICE FOR GRADUALLY PUTTING UNDER PRESSURE PNEUMATIC SYSTEMS

## Abstract
A device for gradually putting under pressure pneumatic systems, in particular for automatic starting up of presses, pneumatic actuators and pneumatic power consuming machines in general. The device comprises a valve casing 1 defining a passage for the fluid, between an inlet port 2 and an outlet port 3 a pneumatically operated pressure reducing valve 8,9 is arranged in the fluid passage and operates in order to substantially reduce the pressure of the fluid fed in, each time the system is started up, said valve 8,9 opening instantaneously and making it possible to feed the fluid at full pressure value, as soon as the pressure of the fluid in the system reaches a pre established value. The valve device also comprises a single acting valve 27,30 for rapid exhaust of the system.
