# Pulse control of an electro magnetically actuated viscous fluid coupling.

## Abstract
A viscous fluid coupling employing an electro magnet 100, 32 which receives electrical pulses in response to a signal received from a heat sensing device to operate a valve arm 90 to seal and unseal an inlet passage 86 fluidly communicating an operating chamber with a storage chamber. The operating chamber is defined by a clutch member 44 and a housing member 58 that are rotatably disposed relative to one another. The storage chamber is defined by a cover plate 74 and a valve plate 76 and is in fluid communication with the operating chamber via a discharge passage and the inlet passage 86 . A pump displaces fluid from the operating chamber through the discharge passage into the storage chamber. The inlet passage 86 when unsealed directs fluid from the storage chamber to the operating chamber. The valve arm 90 is moved in one direction in response to inducing a magnetic field and in the other direction by a spring when the magnetic field is not induced. Fluid is disposed within the coupling and, when located in the operating chamber, transmits torque from the clutch to the housing. The magnetic field is induced and terminated by an electrical control 108 at a controlled duty ratio dependent upon a signal from the heat sensing device to control the amount of fluid entering the operating chamber and thus control the speed of the housing 58 .
