## Description
METHOD OF TERMINATING ISOCITRATE DEHYDROGENASE REACTIONDetailed Description of the Invention The present invention is employed in assaying various substances in a specimen or in measuring activities of various enzymes. The present invention relates to a method terminating an isocitrate dehydrogenase reaction in a system of NADPH nicotinamide adenine dinucleotidephosphate of reduced type NADP nicotinamide adenine dinucleotidephosphate of oxidized type . More specifically. the present invention relates to a method of terminating an isocitrate dehydrogenase iCDH reaction in a NADPHEMI1.1 NADP system to convert the system to a NADPH NADP system.Brief Description of the Drawing Fig. 1 is a diagram showing the influence of the EDTA concentration log on the iCDH activity. It is a common practice to detect urea, creatinine, creatine, guanine, adenosine, or the like generally present in a specimen such as urine or blood and to measure the activities of various enzymes concerned with substances as mentioned just above. In the detection and enzymatic reactions of such substances, ammonia is formed, and the formed ammonia is converted into glutamic acid with the aid of G DH glutamate dehydrogenase . In this case, the amount of NADH decreased in the coupled reaction of NADPH b NADP is determined by measuring absorption at 340 nm. Since ammonia is yielded in this reaction system without fail, ammonia originally present in a specimen is involved in the measurement so that a difficulty is experienced in accurate determination. This problem may be solved if only ammonia originally present in the specimen is preliminarily reacted with a KG ketoglutaric acid with the aid of GQDH to convert the ammonia into glutamic acid.Since the system of ammonia glutamic acid is accompanied by the conversion of NADPH NADP , NADPH must be reproduced according to the reverse reaction of NADPi NADPH. In this case, a coupled reaction may be caused with isocitric acid as a substrate in the presence of iCDH isocitrate dehydrogenase and metallic ions such as magnesium or manganese ions.This reaction system can be expressed by the following formula I . EMI3.1 As shown in formula I , consumption of ammonia in a specimen and assay of ammonia formed by decomposition of urea can be made according to the same coupled reaction. Accurate determination of ammonia formed by decomposition of urea can be performed for the just time after consumption of ammonia in the specimen is completed and the reaction of NADP NADPH is completely terminated. Therefore, the problem has been how to completely terminate the reaction of NADP NADPH in the system of NADPH NADP in formula I . It has not heretofore been known to completely terminate only the reaction of NADP be NADPH. It is a common practice to assay triglycerides in a specimen such as blood and to measure the activities of GOT glutamic acid oxaloacetic acid transaminase and GPT glutamic acid pyruvic acid transaminase . In the detection of triglycerides and various enzymatic reactions, pyruvic acid is formed at the final stage, and the formed pyruvic acid is converted into lactic acid with the aid of LDH lactate dehydrogenase . The amount of NADH decreased by the coupled reaction of NADPH . NADP in such conversion was determined by measuring absorption at 340 nm. However, since pyruvic acid is yielded without fail in this reaction system, pyruvic acid and free glycerol originally present in a specimen are involved in the measurement. Thus, a difficulty has been experienced in performing accurate determination. No problem may be involved if pyruvic acid originally present in the specimen is converted into lactic acid with the aid of LDH in a pretreatment.Since the system of pyruvic acid lactic acid is accompanied by the conversion of NADPH e NADP , NADPH must be reproduced according to the reverse reaction of NADPf NADPN. In this case, a coupled reaction may be caused with isocitric acid as a substrate in the presence of iCDH and metallic ions such as magnesium or manganese ions. This reaction system can be expressed by the following formula II . EMI5.1 As shown in formula II , consumption of pyruvic acid and free glycerol in a specimen and assay of pyruvic acid formed from triglycerides can be made according to the same coupled reaction.Accurate determination of pyruvic acid formed from triglycerides can be performed for the first time after consumption of pyruvic acid in the specimen is completed and the reaction of NADP NADPH is com pletely terminated. Therefore, the problem has been how to terminate the reaction of NADP NADPH in the system of NADPH e NADP in formula II . It has not heretofore been known to completely terminate only the reaction ofNADP NADPH. As a result of intensive investigations with a view to developing a method of completely terminating only a reaction of isocitricEMI6.1 in the above mentioned formulae I and II , the inventors of the present invention have succeeded in completely terminating the reaction of isocitric acid iCDH a KG by addi tion of a metal chelating agent. The present inventidn provides a method of terminating an iCDH reaction in assaying a substance according to the reaction of NADPH to NADP , characterized by terminating an iCDH reaction by adding a chelating agent in a system of reproduction of NADPH from NADP formed from NADPH in the conjoint presence of an isocitrate, metallic ions such as magnesium or manganese ions, and iCDH. Metallic ions usable herein include those of magnesium, manganese, iron, copper, zinc, tin, and calcium. However, usable metallic ions are not limited to those ionic species mentioned above.

However, usable chelating agents are not limited to those chelating agents mentioned above. EMI8.1 According to the present invention, a conversion of formula III g formula IV as mentioned above is made by addition of a chelating agent.More specifically, complete consumption of ammonia or pyruvic acid in a specimen is effected according to formula III , followed by addition of a chelating agent to the reaction system to terminate the reaction of NADP NADPH, while, thereafter, a substance to be assayed in the specimen is decomposed and NADPH is consumed by the reaction of NADPH o NADP to perform accurate assay of the specimen. The termination of the iCDH reaction by a chelating agent according to the present invention is very beneficial in that various reactions can be carried out in a medium as it is after the termination of the reaction by utilizing the reaction of NADPH b NADP . The amount of a chelating agent, for example,EDTA, to be added to the reaction system may be 10 mM or more. Fig.l is a diagram showing the influence of the EDTA concentration log on the iCDH activity. It is understood that iCDH completely loses its activity at a concentration of 5 mum. The method of terminating an iCDH reaction according to the present invention can be utilized in assaying a substance which yields ammonia upon decomposition thereof and in measuring the activity of an enzyme associated therewith. It can also be utilized in assaying a substance which produces pyruvic acid upon decomposition thereof and in measuring the activity of an enzyme associated therewith.
