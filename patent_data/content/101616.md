# Magnetic head shifting means for flexible disk memory system.

## Abstract
A magnetic head shifting means for flexible disk mem ory system wherein kinetic energy of an arm is absorbed by means of a cushioning material interposed between the arm and an abutment of a shackle rod thereby to reduce a tran sient period of time which is the one until the memory me dium and magnetic heads reach their stable state, whilst damage of the memory medium is suppressed in steady state, whereby stable electromagnetic conversion charac teristics can be obtained.
