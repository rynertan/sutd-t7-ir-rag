# Double leaflet cardiac valvular prosthesis.

## Abstract
Cardiac valvular prosthesis of mechanical type not requiring for the opening and closing movement of the leaflets 2 the presence of hinges or pins. The leaflets 2 open and close, with rotational and translational movement, by slipping along curved tracks 3 , two per each leaflet 2 made out in the inside of the housing ring 1 of the valve, in its central position, and jutting out of the ring 1 . In location fit with these jutting out slipping tracks 3 , the side edge of the leaflets 2 is provided with suitable notches or indenta tions aiming both at making the leaflet 2 rotate and at preventing its coming out of the valve housing.
