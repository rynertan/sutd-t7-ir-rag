# Automatic track following system.

## Abstract
A pair of detecting heads 9, 11 are disposed in posi tions corresponding respectively to single heads 2, 6 at both ends of a multichannel head unit 1 , symmetrically inclined with respect to the tape traveling direction. The center positions of these detecting heads are severally in alignment with the center positions of tracks of a magnetic tape 19 . The phase difference between track playback signals reproduced respectively by these detecting heads is detected, and a tracking error is corrected in accordance with the phase difference.
