## Description
A Method and an Apparatus for ModelingBit Rate Justification Field of the invention This invention relates to a method and an apparatus for modeling bit rate justification for multiplexing in digital communication systems. BackgroundAs compared with the positive bit rate justification which is widely used today for plexiochronous multiplexing, the positive zero negative justification has a number of important advantages in the sense of plexiochronous synchronous compatibility, plexiochronous digital switching compatibility, symmetry of frame structure and flexibility of network inter connection. However, the existing positive zero negative justification is accompanied with high basic jitter produced by pulse stuffing which is difficult to remove, resulting in relatively high output jitter.It is disclosed in a German article entitled The inherent jitter of positive zero negative justification system utilizing digital clock recovery Eigenjitter Von Positiv Null Negativ Stopsystemen mit digitaler Taktruckgewinnung, ttFrequenz , 33 1979 ,12. that in the positive zero negative justification exploited in the PCM30D system using digital clock recovery, the maximum peak to peak output jitter is above 100 ui unit bit percentage when the input is free of jitter. Since all kinds of communic ation services demand a strict specified jitter, the jitter has been well known as an important technical requirement in a digital communication system.Moreover, the jitter is accu mulative in the system, its value restricts the number of multiplex and the distance of transmission as the total jitter in a system should not be allowed to exceed a maximum tolerance of 150 ui set in the CCITT protocol G 703.As a result, although the positive zero negative justification possesses advantages as mentioned above, its application in digital network is restricted due to the high output jitter which deteriorates transmission quality seriously and makes it difficult to involve positive zero negative justification into digital network of CCITT protocol G 703.Summary of the inventionIt is an object of the present invention to reduce the high output jitter value in positive zero negative bit rate justification by removing the basic jitter. Based on the principle of spectrum transformation, the spectrum of basic jitter in a positive zero negative bit rate justification is first, according to the invention, transformed and shifted from zero frequency range in which the basic jitter is difficult to eliminate to higher frequency range where the removal of the spectral components can be easily realized. Then the high frequency translated version of the basic jitter passes through a phaselocked loop PLL in a bit rate recovery part of the apparatus, leaving only waiting jitter in the output which is of negligible amount. Therefore, the goal of reducing the output jitter is achieved.In order to transform the jitter spectrum, a central frequencyMo of the frequency band toward which the spectrum is shifted should be introduced. The central frequency Mo is referred to as modeling parameter in the present invention. The factors that affect the selection of Mo are as follows Mo must be set outside the noise band of the PLL in the bit recovery part the value of the central frequency Mo should be significantly smaller than that of the frame frequency and the ratio of the frequency Mo over the frame frequency must be chosen as a simple fraction in order to simplify the circuit realization. Besides, the frequency tolerance range and performance of jitter suppression should also be taken into account in selecting the frequency Mo.In conventional positive zero negative bit rate justification, no modeling parameter is set and the process of justification is carried out without additional control. Although there are three possible justifications positive, zero, negative in the above mentioned justification, only one works and accomplishes the unidirectional justification at one time, i.e., only one of the three justifications positive, zero, negative takes place in the system at one time with the justification rate equals to the difference value made by tributary frequency and multiplexed frequency. The value, since quite small, produces a basic jitter of which the spectrum is centered around low frequency range and falls into the noise band of PLL in the bit rate recovery part. Therefore, the basic jitter is hard to remove.In the apparatus according to the present invention, a modeling parameter is set to provide additional control to the justification the two justification circuits are included to perform the positive or negative justification separately under the control of the modeling parameter. In this way, positive, negative and zero justifications are carried out simultaneously in the apparatus of the present invention. It is known from the spectrum analysis that if these 2 simultaneously carried out justifications are independent to each other, the spectrum of the basic jitter is transformed to the vicinity of the modeling parameter Mo and easily filtered out by the PLL in the bit rate recovery part.A correlator is inserted between the two justification circuits in the apparatus of the present invention to remove the correlation of the two justifications effectively, ensuring the independence of the two justifications. Besides, a correlation detector which verifies and detects the stuffing instructions by making use of the character of the fixed bit rate in the first justification so as to improve the capability of reducing the bit slip, and a pre smoother which is used eliminate the influence of nonlinearity in the PLL, are provided in the bit rate recovery part of the apparatus of the present invention.In the apparatus of the present invention, the modeling parameter, the correlator and the correlation detector can be designed as common units for all tributary lines so as to reduce complexity. With the character of the symmetry of frame structure in the positive zero negative justification, the present invention can either realize multiplexing from n l th order hierarachy to nth order hierarachy, or direct multiplexing from n 2 th order to nth order with only one justification, or n 2 th order to nth order, n l th order to nth order hierarachy hybrid multiplexing, offering flexibility in network and reducing complexity. Brief description of the drawingsFig 1 schematically shows the justification part of the apparatus of the present invention and Fig 2 schematically shows the bit rate recovery part of the apparatus of the present invention. Detailed description of the preferred embodiment of the present inventionReferring to Fig 1, the bit rate justification part of the apparatus of the present invention includes a first justification circuit 1, a second justification circuit 4, a correlator 2, a buffer 3, a justification transfer unit 6, a store retreive buffer 8, a stuffing instruction constructing circuit 5 and an adder 7.The operation of the bit rate justification part is as follows first, a negative zero or positive zero justification on the fixed bit rate Mo is carried out in the first justification circuit 1 within the fixed locations of the negative or positive stuffing bit in the frame .structure signal A of positive zero negative justification, thus completing a first justification process a second justification of positive zero or negative zero takes place in the second justification circuit 4. A correlator 2 is inserted between the first and second justification circuits 1 and 4 for smoothing the stuffed pulse in the first justification process by the first justification circuit 1 so as to remove the correlation of the two justifications, making the second justification an independent stochastic process in respect to the first justification process.The correlator 2 may be a correlatedPLL of which the input is an information carrying time slot pulse having processed by the first justification circuit 1, and the output is an uniform sequence. Auxiliary signals such as stuffing location, stuffing threshold, and request area limit signals are produced by the frequency dividing chain in the phase detector of the PLL in the second justification process. The buffer 3 which inputs the phase detect signal to the second justification circuit 4 for the second justification process consists of two phase splitters of which the number of cascades should be set to meet the maximum input jitter tolerance requirements. The inputs of the buffer 3 are the tributary clock signal B and the output signal of the correlator 2, its output being fed to the second justification circuit 4 as a phase detect signal.Based on the phase detect signal, the second justification circuit 4 carries out the second justification process of the output of the correlator 2 under the control of the auxiliary signals of the output of the correlator 2, and the output of the second justification circuit 4 is transmitted to the read out control port of the store retrieve buffer 8 via the justification transfer circuit 6. The tributary code C is written into the store retrieve buffer 8 by the tributary clock signal B through the write port of the buffer 8, the code C being read out from the read out port of the buffer 8 in accordance with the frame structure and the justification results of the two justification processes. The output of the store retrieve buffer 8 is added in an adder 7 with the output signal of the stuffing instruction constructing circuit 5 to form the final transmit code G.Referring to Fig 2, the bit rate recovery part includes a instruction detector 12, a correlation detector 9, an information carrying time slot recovery circuit 10, a presmoother 11, a store retrieve buffer 13 and a PLL 14.In the bit rate recovery part, the instruction detector 12 first detects stuffing instructions from the receive code D.In order to improve the capability of reducing bit slip, the correlation detector 9 is provided to verify and detect the stuffing instructions from the receive code D by making use of the character of the fixed bit rate in the first justification process. The correlation detector 9 works according to the following rules when an individual transmission bit error mispresents a positive or negative justification on certain location as zero justification, the error is corrected by the correlation of the justification when an individual transmission bit error mispresents a zero justification on certain location as positive or negative justification, the error will be corrected unless the correlated bit error occurs on two successive correlated locations after the location that the biterror occurs on.After stuffing instruction is detected the outputs of the detectors 9 and 12 are fed to the information carrying time slot recovery 10 from which the tributary information carrying time slot signal is obtained to write the tributary code D into the store retrieve buffer 13. A tributary code F is read out from the buffer 13 with the tributary read out clock signal that is provided by the PLL 14. The pre smoother 11 which is consisted of N AND gates and flip flop circuits is set prior to the PLL 14 to avoid possible low frequency jitter which might be caused by the nonlinear response of the PLL 14. The rate of the input clock signal E of the pre smoother 11 equals to the rate of the informationcarrying time slot signal which has been processed by the first justification circuit 1 in Fig 1.This input clock signal E can be either obtained from the existing one or from the reproduction of the receive clock signal. The output pulse of the pre smoother 11 is fed to the PLL 14, with the bit rate equals to the tributary frequency.A 3rd order multiplexer with the function of cross multiplexing among the first order hierarachies is provided in the invention, which allows the multiplexing of four 8448 Kb s 2nd order hierarachies, or direct multiplexing of sixteen 2048Kb s first order hierarachies with only one justification, or hybrid multiplexing of 2nd order and first order hierarachies with the function of synchronous plexiochronous compatibility.The frame structure conforms with the recommended frame structure of the positive zero negative justification of theCCITTG 753 and the peak to peak values of maximum output jitter in the tributary lines of the first and second hierarachy do not exceed 3 ui with other performances also meeting the respective CCITT protocols.The apparatus of the present invention preserves many important advantages of the positive zero negative justification, such as compatible to synchronous and digital switching network, having symmetrical frame structure and flexible for interconnecting network, while removing the basic jitter effectively and leaving only a small value of waiting jitter. In the frame structures of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th hierarachies recommended by CCITT G745, G753, G754, the maximum peak to peak value of the tributary output jitter when the input free from jitter will not exceed several percents of ui, which is less than that of the conventional positive zero negative justification 100 ui and the positive justification recommended by CCITT 20 ui 35 ui with other performances satisfying respective CCITT protocols. The complexity of this apparatus equals to that of the comparable positive justification. The apparatus of the present invention can widely be used in opticalofiber transmission system, microwave digital trsnsmission system, digital switching multiplexing system and integrated service network, acquiring system performances required by the development of digital network, satisfying transmission quality requirement for various services and permitting repeated digital multiplexing for long distance communication.
