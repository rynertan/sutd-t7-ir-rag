## Description
The present invention relates to hardstocks and fat blends which are suitable for the preparation of diet margarines and spreads with a reduced fat content and to a process for preparing these hardstocks and fat blends. Diet margarines and spreads are emulsions of water and oil, preferably emulsions in which the oil phase forms the continuous phase since such emulsions are bac teriologically more stable and mainly consists of triglycerides, which are rich in cis polyunsaturated fatty acids. Triglycerides of cis polyunsaturated fatty acids are known for their cholesterol reducing action and consequently are highly valued by more and more consumers. Margarines generally contain about 80 fat, while low calorie spreads generally contain 20 60 fat. The fat blends which are suitable for margarines con sist of a matrix of hardstock crystallized at room temperature in which an oil is occluded which is liquid at room temperature 20 C . The liquid oil is preferably an oil rich in triglycerides derived from cis poly unsaturated fatty acids, i.e. an oil containing 40 to 70 or more cis polyunsaturated fatty acids. In recent years attempts have been made to increase the proportion of these triglycerides at the expense of the solid fat, while retaining the physical stability of the product, that is to say while retaining the resis tance to oil exudation during storage and spreading of the emulsions which are prepared using these fat blends. With success, fat blends have been prepared which contain about 15 of a hardstock which is solid at room temperature, the remainder of the fat mainly consisting of triglycerides derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids. Very recently, investigation has been carried out by Applicants with the aim of preparing fat blends which have an extremely low content of tri glycerides from saturated fatty acids. This investiga tion has led to a hardstock and to fat blends, which form the subject of the present invention, and to a process of preparing such. The hardstock, or the structural fat according to the invention, comprises H₃, HHU, HUH and H₂M triglycerides in which the ratio HHU HUH ranges from 1 4 to 6 1, and preferably ranges from 1 2 to 5 1, in which H represents saturated fatty acids having 16 24 C atoms, U represents mono unsaturated or cis polyunsaturated fatty acids having 16 24 C atoms and M represents fatty acids of which the chain length is 2 10 C atoms shorter than the chain length of fatty acids H, and preferably the chain length of the fatty acids M is 12 or 14 C atoms. For good physical stability at 20 C and so called body , the ratio H₂M H₃ is of some importance, this generally varying from 1 2 to 4 1, and preferably from 1 1 to 3 1. The content of H₂M triglycerides will generally not exceed 90 , preferably it will be less than 65 wt. and ideally range from 15 60wt. these percentages are based on the total weight of the hardstock . H₂M triglycerides are very effective as matrix structural fat for the emulsion without exhibiting the detrimental effects, with respect to the melting behaviour, of the H₃ triglycerides. H₂U triglycerides also contribute to the structure of emulsions. The content of these triglycerides in the hardstock will generally range from 10 70 wt. , and preferably range from 30 to 65 wt. . H₃ triglycerides can be present in the hardstock generally in an amount of at most 60 and preferably of 10 55 wt. . As already reported, these triglycerides leave behind a waxy impression in the mouth when present in a large amount in edible emulsions. The hardstock according to the invention can be prepared by a process which comprises the following steps The mixture of triglycerides to be submitted to directed interesterification preferably has a content of cis polyunsaturated fatty acids of at least 40 and ideally of 60 75 calculated on the weight of fatty acids . This mixture can consist of oils or oleins which contain no solid fat at room temperature 20 C , such as for example safflower oil, sunflower oil, grapeseed oil, maize oil or mixtures thereof. Directed interesterification of oils is a technique known Processes in which temperature cycles are used require an accurate control of the temperature. According to the aforementioned NL 142 279, the mixture to be inter esterified is alternately kept at a temperature 1 15 below the cloud point that a randomly interesterified mixture of the same triglycerides would have and there after at a temperature which is at least just as high as and preferably not more than 15 C above the cloud point of said randomly interesterified mixture. This treatment is continued until the cloud point of the reaction mixture is at least 5 C, preferably at least 10 C above the cloud point of the aforesaid randomly interesterified mixture. According to the present in vention a process as described above can be applied. However, a method is preferred in which the directed interesterification is carried out substantially isothermally, i.e. without use of temperature changes, at a temperature remaining practically constant. The most suitable temperature will obviously depend on the mixture used of the triglycerides to be interesterified. The most suitable mixtures to be used for the purpose of the present invention comprise oils which contain at least 40 and preferably 60 75 of cis polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as sunflower oil, safflower oil, grapeseed oil, maize oil and the like. Preferably, safflower oil, sunflower oil or mixtures thereof are submitted to isothermal directed interesterification. The interesterification temperature may vary from 5 C to 10C. Preferably, a reaction temperature of 0 8 C is applied. The reaction time can vary from 20 to 72 hours. These long reaction times are the result of In order to shorten the reaction time, for example to 20 hours and less, and to effect an easier separation of liquid oil and relatively large crystals after interesterification, it is advantageous to add to the liquid oil that is to be interesterified a small amount of saturated fat, such that the total level of saturated fatty acids ranges from 12 17 calculated on the weight of fatty acids . Preferably 1 6 calculated on fat of a completely saturated fat is added, preferably completely saturated sunflower oil having a melting point of 69 C or com pletely saturated rapeseed oil having a melting point of 70 C. Also advantageous is the addition of a partially hydrogenated fat to the oil to be interesterified, in an amount such that between 0 and 10 of elaidic acid is present in the total mixture. The interesterification reaction is carried out until the desired amount of solid phase is obtained. This can for example be determined by nuclear magnetic resonance measurements, e.g. at 20 C. If it is desired not to apply too long a reaction time, the reaction can be carried out until less than the maximum amount of solid phase to be formed has been formed. In the sunflower oil hydrogenated sunflower oil system in the ratio 95.5 4.5, an amount of solid phase of 5 10 at 20 C calculated on fat is sufficient indication to stop the directed interesterification process. Generally the reaction is carried out until the content of saturated fatty acids in the olein obtained, after removal of the saturated triglycerides formed, which are insoluble at the reaction temperature, is below 9 and preferably between 4 and 8 calculated on fatty acids . Suitable interesterification catalysts are, for example, sodium ethoxide, potassium ethoxide, sodium methoxide, potassium methoxide, sodium or potassium metal and or alloys thereof, which are used in amounts varying from 0.1 to 1 , preferably from 0.2 to 0.8 , on the basis of the weight of the mixture to be inter esterified. The liquid oil to be interesterified is, as usual, dried to a moisture content of preferably less than 0.1 wt. and is subsequently mixed with the catalyst, which is activated at a temperature lying between 40 and 70 C. Hereafter the reaction mixture is cooled com paratively quickly, preferably quicker that 10 C per minute, to the selected temperature. After completion of the interesterification reaction it is possible to remove the formed solid phase by fractionation. This can for example be done by applying the so called Lanza fractionation with the aid of an aqueous solution of a surface active material such as sodium dodecylsulphate. The preferred triglyceride composition of the liquid oil resulting from controlled interesterification, to which optionally a small amount of a completely satu rated, high melting fat has been added in order to speed up the reaction, if need be after removal of the insoluble stearin, can be given as follows As already stated, the H₃ and, if need be, the H₂U triglycerides can be removed by fractionation and, during the preparation of the final fat mixture, be re placed by another hardstock consisting mainly of H₂M, or remain in the interesterified mixture and form part of the total hardstock component of the fat mixture. The above mentioned, essential H₂M triglycerides can be obtained by interesterification, for example random interesterification, of a mixture of triglycerides in which the ratio of H to M fatty acids lies in the range 0.4 to 8.5, preferably 1.0 to 3.0. Random interesterification is carried out under moisture free conditions, preferably at a temperature of 100 140 C, under reduced pressure, in the presence of a catalyst, such as an alkali metal alkoxide, an alkali metal or an alkali metal hydroxide. It is also possible to produce H₂M triglycerides by interesterification of a suitable mixture of fatty acids with glycerol, for example according to the fol lowing method One part glycerol is mixed with about 3.5 to 3.8 parts of the mixture of fatty acids. The mixture of fatty acids and glycerol is quickly heated, in a vessel pro vided with a jacket, to a temperature of about 190 C and is subsequently kept for at least 3 hours at a tem perature of 220 C to 225 C. The reaction is carried out with stirring, under atmospheric pressure, in a vessel standing under nitrogen. During the reaction, water is removed by distillation. After a reaction time of 3 4 hours, the free fatty acid content of the mixture is determined. When the content of free fatty acids re mains unchanged, the reaction is complete and the excess fatty acids are removed by distillation at a temperature of 240 C at a pressure of 5 mm mercury. During the distillation the content of free fatty acid is determined and as soon as an acid value of 4 is ob tained, the reaction is stopped and the product is cooled to a temperature of 90 C. The mixture of hard fats is subsequently refined and bleached with alkali. H₂M triglycerides are preferably produced by random interesterification of a partly or completely hydrogen ated fat a which is selected from coconut, babassu, palmkernel, tucum, murmuru or ouricurum fat, mixtures of these fats or fractions thereof, having a melting point between 30 and 41 C, with a fat b , which is completely or partly hydrogenated and is optionally fractionated, in which at least 60 of the fatty acid radicals are C Fractionation can be carried out in the absence of a solvent dry fractionation , in the presence of an organic solvent wet fractionation such as acetone or hexane, or by using an aqueous solution of a surface active material the so called Lanza fractionation , under conditions such that part and preferably the major part of the triglycerides a and c , defined hereafter, are removed, so that a fat is obtained having the following triglyceride composition Triglycerides a consisting of a mixture of HML, M₃, M₂H, M₂L, HL₂, ML₂ and L₃, wherein H and M have the same meanings as above and L is a saturated fatty acid radical with less than 12 C atoms 0 20 wt. Triglycerides b , so called H₂M triglycerides 55 100 wt. , preferably 65 100 wt. Triglycerides c so called H₃ triglycerides 0 20 wt. . Fractionation is preferably carried out in an organic solvent, especially acetone, and preferably in 1 step or in 2 steps, the first step being carried out at 22 35 C, preferably 24 29 C, whereby a high melting stearin fraction is obtained containing mainly tri glycerides of three saturated fatty acids of the H type, and a lower melting olein fraction is obtained which is fractionated further at 8 24 C, preferably 15 22 C, whereby a second stearin fraction is obtained containing 55 100 wt. , preferably 65 100 wt. of triglycerides b and 0 25 wt. , preferably 0 10 wt. triglyceride c . It is also possible to carry out a first fractionation at 8 24 C, with a stearin fraction and an olein fraction being obtained, and subsequently to fraction ate the stearin at 22 35 C, whereby a second stearin and a second olein mid fraction enriched in tri glycerides b are obtained. Another suitable fractionation method consists in mixing the mixture to be fractionated with a diluting liquid oil such as soyabean oil or sunflower oil and carrying out the fractionation, preferably in two steps, the first step at 15 35 C, preferably at 20 29 C, and the second step at 8 24 C, preferably at 15 22 C, whereby a mid fraction enriched in triglycerides b is obtained. It is also possible to carry out a one step fraction ation, either in the presence of an organic solvent, such as e.g. hexane or acetone, at a temperature lying between 8 and 20 C, by which a stearin which is rich in H₂M triglycerides and an olein which is relatively poor in H₂M triglycerides are obtained, or in the absence of a solvent dry fractionation between 15 and 25 C. Preferably a fat rich in lauric acid, obtained by dry fractionation at a temperature lying between 20 and 26 C, e.g. palmkernel olein, which has optionally been hydrogenated to a melting point of 39 41 C, is mixed with palm oil having a melting point of 55 58 C in a ratio of 70 80 30 20 and randomly interesterified, whereafter the mixture is fractionated in the presence of acetone at a temperature lying between 8 and 20 C, preferably between 9 and 15 C, by which the stearin fraction rich in H₂M triglycerides is isolated. Another suitable manner of preparing H₂M tri glycerides comprises the interesterification of a mix ture of hydrogenated fat rich in lauric acid, e.g. palm kernel olein, with a rapeseed oil hydrogenated to a melting point of 70 C preferably having a high content of erucic acid, in a ratio of 70 80 30 20, whereafter fractionation as described above is carried out in one step. Very suitable triglyceride mixtures which are rich in H₂M triglycerides can be obtained by isolating a mid fraction which is obtained by the double wet fraction ation described above. The double fractionation can be carried out on a randomly interesterified mixture that has been obtained starting from hydrogenated palmkernel olein melting point 41 C and hydrogenated palm oil melting point 58 C in a ratio of 40 60 60 40, or starting from the same hydrogenated palmkernel olein and rapeseed oil melting point 70 C , which is prefer ably rich in erucic acids, in a ratio of 30 40 70 60. It is obviously also possible to use the starting mater ials of the mixture to be randomly interesterified in non hydrogenated form and to perform hydrogenation after interesterification. H₂M triglycerides can also be prepared by an enzy matic process by subjecting a mixture of triglycerides which form a source of H and M fatty acids, or a mix ture of triglycerides and fatty acids as source of H and M fatty acids, to enzymatic interesterification with the aid of a lipase enzyme, the mixture being hydrogenated before or after interesterification if desired. The enzymatic reaction is preferably carried out in an organic solvent, e.g. hexane, preferably at a temper ature lying between 5 and 80 C, in the presence of for example Preferably a lipase is used which acts selectively on the 1 and 3 position of the triglyceride molecule, such as e.g. The hardstock according to the invention is obtained by combining the material containing the H₂M tri glycerides thus prepared and the solid fat arising from directed interesterification of the liquid oil. The fat blends according to the invention and particularly fat blends for diet margarines and spreads can be pre pared by mixing the hardstock described above with directed, interesterifieed oil optionally fractionated and, if desired, an oil that is liquid at room tempera ture 20 C , which contains at least 40 and in the ideal case 60 75 of poly cis unsaturated fatty acids. Mixtures of for example safflower oil and sunflower oil are pre eminently suitable for this purpose. The amounts of hardstock and liquid oil to be used depend on the properties of the product to be prepared and can be varied as desired. The preferred fat blends for diet margarines and spreads according to the invention are characterized by a content of H₃ triglycerides, in which H repre sents C The preferred fat blends according to the invention are characterized by a specific fatty acid composition and particularly by a content of saturated fatty acids with a chain length of 12 24 carbon atoms of at most 17 and preferably ranging from 10 to 15 a content of trans unsaturated fatty acids of at most 10 and preferably ranging from 0 4 , and a content of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the cis configuration of at most 76 , and preferably from 50 76 , the remainder up to 100 consisting mainly of mono cis unsaturated fatty acids. Further, the fat blends according to the invention can contain 0 10 diglycerides which preferably consist of HU OH , H₂ OH and HM OH diglycerides. The invention also relates to emulsions, particularly water in oil emulsions, such as margarines and spreads having a decreased fat content. These are prepared in a manner known In particular, diet margarines and spreads retaining a reasonable consistency can be prepared from a fat blend that contains relatively little solid phase at 20 C by using the hardstocks according to the invention. Thus, for example, products with only e.g. 3 7 solid phase at 20 C can be prepared, which have at this tem perature a C value of 50 100 g cm² in spite of the extremely low level of solids. The invention will now be explained by reference to the following Examples. Sunflower oil was dried to a moisture content of less than 0.01 wt. . 0.6 wt. sodium methanolate was added to the oil.
