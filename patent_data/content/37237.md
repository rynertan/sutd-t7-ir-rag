# Energizing circuit for discharge type fire alarm sensor unit.

## Abstract
An energizing circuit for a discharge type fire alarm sensor unit which includes a circuit A for supplying output pulses to a discharge tube 8 to render the tube ready to discharge, a discharge frequency detecting circuit C for supplying a feedback signal, and a control circuit D responsive to the feedback signal for increasing the frequency of the output pulses from the circuit A when the frequency of the discharges of the tube 8 increases as indicated by the feedback signal so that the sensor is continuously sensitive to ultraviolet radiation such as is caused by the flames of a fire disaster but is insensitive to spontaneous radioactivity.
