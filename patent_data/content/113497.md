## Description
METHOD OF PROTECTING ORGANIC POLYMERS FROM ATTACK BY PERCHLOROETHYLENE This invention relates to a method of protecting organic polymers from attack by perchloroethylene. When polychlorinated biphenyls were outlawed for use as dielectric fluids in electrical equipment on the grounds that they were an environmental hazard, a search was conducted for other suitable dielectric fluids. One of the substitute fluids that is now being used is perchloroethylene, C2C14. Perchloroethylene is a highly desirable dielectric fluid because it is not an environmental pollutant and yet has a high dielectric strength and is also non flammable. When percholoroethylene is manufactured, various stabilizers are put into it such as N methyl pyrrole and p tert amyl phenol see U.S. Patent 4,293,433 . These stabilizers are anti oxidants which are added to prevent the decomposition of the perchloroethylene in the presence of oxygen. While commercial perchlorethylene has good physical and electrical properties, it has been found that certain types of polymeric coatings used as insulation, such as parylene, are degraded by the perchloroethylene even with the commercial inhibitors present. The degradation of these organic polymers would eventually lead to electrical breakdown and failure of the transformer. The addition of common stabilizers such as melamine to the commercially stabilized perchloroethylene dielectric fluid does not prevent the degradation of the polymeric coatings. Accordingly, the present invention resides in a method of protecting organic polymers which are attacked by perchloroethylene from said attack which comprises adding to said perchloroethylene from 0.01 to 0.5 by weight of an aromatic phenol. We have found that aromatic phenols substantially reduce the degradation of organic polymers, such as parylene, in the presence of perchloroethylene. This is indicated by a greatly reduced fall off in the dielectric strength when these stabilizers are present. In addition, while the commercial fluid oxidized to form suspended carbon particles, some of which settled on the transformer tank, this did not occur when the stabilizers of this invention were added to the fluid. As these particles are electrically conductive, they are highly undesirable in a dielectric fluid. In order that the invention can be more clearly understood, a convenient embodiment thereof will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawing which is a side view, in section, of a transformer containing a stabilized dielectric fluid. Referring to the drawing, a transformer I comprising a sealed tank 2, a ferrous metal coil 3 consisting of alternating layers of a conductor and an insulator, a primary coil 4, a secondary coil 5, and a dielectric fluid 6 which surrounds and covers the core and coils. The stabilizers are aromatic phenols. Suitable aromatic phenols include hydroquinone, di t butylparacresol, 8 hydroxy guinoline, resorcinol, phloroglucinol, pyrocatechol, and pyrogallol. The preferred stabilizer is hydroquinone as it has been found more effective in preventing the decomposition of the organic polymers in the presence of perchloroethlyene. At least 0.01 by weight of the stabilizer should be added to the commercially stabilized perchloroethylene as less than 0.01 has been found to be marginal. More than 0.5 of the stabilizer can be used but that is undesirable as it has no additional effect in preventing the degradation of the polymers. The preferred percentage is from 0.05 to 0.1 . The stabilizers may be used in combination with perchloroethylene alone or in combination with a mixture of perchloroethylene and another dielectric fluid. For example, perchloroethylene is often used in combination with up to 30 , preferably from 5 to 30 , mineral oil.The fluid may be used in all sorts of electrical apparatus including transformers, capacitors, cables, and circuit breakers which contain organic polymers attackable by perchloroethylene. Parylene is poly para xylene , and comes in two forms, parylene C EMI3.1 and parylene N EMI3.2 Parylene C is preferred as its properties are superior.Other organic polymers such as polyesters, epoxies, and polyester amide imides may also be attacked by perchloroethylene, depending on how they are prepared. The invention will now be illustrated with reference to the following Examples EXAMPLE Tests were performed to determine the stability of perchloroethylene alone and when mixed with mineral oil after being heated for seven days at 1250C. The perchloroe thylene used in these tests was purchased from the DiamondShamrock Company and was analyzed as containing 55 i 5 ppm of N methyl pyrrole as an antioxidant.

Tests were performed to determine whether or not the increase in the dissipation factor which resulted above when mineral oil was mixed with perchloroethylene was due to the presence of oxygen.
