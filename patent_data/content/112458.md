# Duplex optical communication device.

## Abstract
A duplex optical communication device is disclosed which includes a transmission module unit 12 having a light emitting element 14 and a lens 61, 62 confronting the light emitting element, a reception module unit 13 having a light receiving element 16 and a lens 62, 92 confronting the light receiving element, and a transmission optical fiber 26 and reception optical fiber 27 , which fibers are so disposed as to confront the light emitting element 14 and the light receiving element 16 , with the lenses 61, 91 , 62, 92 being interposed therebetween. In this device, the dis tance from the end face of the transmission optical fiber 26 confronting the light emitting element 14 to the lens 61, 91 of the transmission module unit 12 is substantially equal to the imaging length given as the focal length of the lens of the transmission module unit 12 , and the distance be tween the light emitting surface of the light emitting element 14 and the lens 61, 91 in the transmission module unit. The distance between the end face of the transmission optical fiber 27 confronting the light receiving element 16 and the lens 62, 92 in the reception module unit 13 is substantially equal to or less than the focal length of the lens 62, 92 in the reception module unit.
