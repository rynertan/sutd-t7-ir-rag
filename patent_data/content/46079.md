# Apparatus for inspecting a heat exchanger tube.

## Abstract
Apparatus for inspecting relatively long, thin walled small bore tubes 1 of a heat exchanger, provided with support plates 4 for holding the tubes in predetermined positions, comprises a composite scanner 6 having a plurality of flexure springs 12A contacting the interior surface of a tube for detecting and profiling tube abnormali ties as the scanner traverses the tube and an eddy current sensor 22A incorporated in the scanner for generating a unique signal as the scanner passes a contiguous support plate 4 to assist in the accurate location of tube abnormali ties.
