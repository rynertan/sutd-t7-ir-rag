# Coal treatment product, process and apparatus.

## Abstract
A process and apparatus for treating coal to produce mi cron size coal particles having high surface reactivity and a low level of ash forming impurities. The process involves grinding the coal in a substantially air tight fluid energy attrition mill 11 to form a hydrophobic coal fraction and a hydrophilic impurity fraction, and separating the fractions in a separator 17 by vir tue of the impurity fraction s affinity for water.
