# Method of producing sheets of crystalline material.

## Abstract
A method of producing sheets of crystalline material, wherein a growth mask 32, 34 is formed upon a substrate 10 so as to expose selected areas of the substrate through the mask and crystalline material is grown at areas of the substrate 10 exposed through the mask and laterally over the surface of the mask to form a sheet of crystalline material 18 . This sheet 18 is separated from the substrate so that the substrate can be reused. To assist separation and ensure the plane of separation does not wander, the substrate or mask are configured to weaken the bonding of the crystalline material thereto. For example, the substrate is scalloped and all but its peaks are covered with the mask, or the mask has a rough surface to ensure voids form between the mask and the crystalline sheet grown thereover.
