# Flow meter and densitometer apparatus and method of operation.

## Abstract
The instrument disclosed herein is designed for meas uring flow rates and densities of moving fluid streams, in cluding liquids, gases, slurries, and fluids which contain solid materials. In one embodiment of this instrument, a conduit section, which has a 90 degree bend therein, is placed in a transfer line which carries the fluid stream to its use point. Defined within the conduit section is a chamber, which is located at the bend in the conduit. Installed within the cham ber is a force measuring transducer and a piston, which is in contact with the diaphragm assembly of the transducer. In operation, a part of the moving fluid is diverted into the cham ber, to equalize fluid pressure across the diaphragm assem bly of the transducer and the piston. This removes the effect of fluid pressure on the flow rate and density measurement, and allows the moving fluid to displace the piston by the force exerted by the fluid. The transducer registers the force and transmits it to a computer, which converts it to a flow rate as a function of the force. A separate transducer meas ures the velocity of the stream and this measurement is con verted to a density value.

## Description
FLOW METER AND DENSITOMETER APPARATUS AND METHOD OF OPERATION The invention relates to an apparatus and method for measuring the flow rate and density of moving fluid streams. More specifically, the apparatus and method is designed to measure the force of a moving fluid stream, and to independently measure the velocity of the stream. From these values, the flow rate and density can be derived. Many operations in the chemical industry, in the recovery of oil and gas from earth formations, and in other industrial processes, require measuring the flow rate and or the density of a moving fluid stream.The usual fluid streams are liquids, gases, and slurries, or liquids and gases which contain solid materials.There are several different types of conventional instruments now available for measuring flow rates and densities of fluid streams. Flow meters are generally classified as the intrusive type or non intrusive type. In the operation of intrusive flow meters, certain components of the instrument are placed directly in the moving fluid stream, so that this part of the instrument is subjected to the erosive effect of the stream at all times. Conversely, the non intrusive flow meters are instruments in which the flow measuring components are not inserted directly into the moving stream, so that the erosive effects of the stream are minimized. A turbine flow meter is an example of a conventional intrusive type flow meter. The turbine structure is an axially mounted rotor. The rotor is placed inside the pipeline which carries the fluid stream to be measured, so that the stream must pass directly through the rotor. This causes the rotor to turn and the rotor blades induce an AC current in the coil surrounding a permanent magnet in the pickup. The frequency of the AC signal is directly proportional to the liquid velocity. With proper calibration, the output frequency can be used for direct flow rate indication The instrument described above, as well as many other commercially available instruments, have certain drawbacks which make them impractical for measuring flow rates of moving fluids in many commercial operations.For example, in some oil well servicing operations, viscous liquids or slurry compositions are injected into the wellbore under high pressure and high velocity. The use of turbine flow meters in these operations has been generally unsatisfactory. For example, the rotor bearings often fail but a more serious problem is that the space between the rotor and the rotor housing becomes clogged. When this happens, the entire rotor structure can either break loose from the rotor housing, and be carried into the wellbore by the moving fluid, or it becomes seized locked in the housing and the moving slurry produces worm holes in the housing wall until a serious failure occurs. The apparatus or instrument of this invention has a distinct advantage over the prior devices in that none of the parts of the apparatus are inserted into the moving fluid stream which is being measured for flow rate, so that the apparatus is a non intrusive flow meter. In addition, the apparatus is also capable of measuring the density of moving fluid streams, so that it can function both as a flow meter and a densitometer. The apparatus of this invention is desiged for measuring the flow rate and density of moving fluid streams, such as liquids, gases, and liquids or gases which have solid materials suspended in the stream. The invention resides in a flowmeter apparatus for measuring the flow rate of a fluid stream, the apparatus comprising a first conduit section for carrying a fluid stream from an inlet end, through the conduit section, and discharging the stream through an outlet end a housing defining a chamber within the first conduit section a fluid contact means positioned in the chamber and adapted for contacting the fluid stream as it flows through the first conduit section a force measuring means positioned in the chamber and in contact with said fluid contact means at least one compartment in said housing between the fluid contact means and the force measuring means a second conduit section in communication with the first conduit section and the compartment for diverting a portion of the fluid stream into said compartment and wherein the portion of the fluid stream diverted through the second conduit section into the compartment exerts a fluid pressure force in said compartment which is equal to the fluid pressure force of the fluid stream which flows through the first conduit section and the fluid stream which flows through the first conduit section exerts a force on the fluid contact means, said force being measured by the force measuring means and the flow rate of said fluid stream. is derived as a function of the force. With the effect of fluid pressureremoved from the system, the force of the fluid stream is then exerted against the fluid contact means and thus picked up by the force measuring means. The flow rate of the moving fluid stream can then be derived as a function of the force. The apparatus also includes a separate means, such as an ultrasonic tranducer unit, for measuring the velocity of that part of the fluid stream which flows through the first conduit section.Preferably, the transducer device is installed on the outside of the first conduit section. The density of the flowing stream can then be derived as a function of the velocity. Figure 1 is a side elevation view, partly in section and in schematic illustration, of one embodiment of a flow meter apparatus of this invention. Figure 2 is a side elevation view, partly in section and in schematic illustration, of another embodiment of a flow meter apparatus. Figure 3 is a fragmentary detail view of a separator means which separates the fluid being measured for flow rate from fluid in the pressure equalization conduit of the apparatus shown in the several embodiments illustrated herein. Figure 4 is a side elevation view, partly in section and schematic illustration, of an apparatus which functions both as a flow meter and as a densitometer. In the drawings, identical parts in each of the embodiments shown in Figures 1, 2, and 3, are identified with the same reference numerals, with letter suffixes being added to distinguish each of the figures. Referring to the flow meter of Figure 1, numeral 10 indicates a section of a conduit. In practice, the usual procedure is to install the conduit section 10 in a pipeline not shown , which carries a fluid composition from a source to a terminal point of use, or disposal. The conduit section 10 has a 90 degree bend therein since the fluid being measured for flow rate generates a maximum force vector as it flows through a 900 bend. However, in actual practice, it is not critical to use a 90 degree bend in the conduit which may have any angle so long as the flow meter apparatus meets the other requirements described herein. The general rule to be applied in determining the angle in a conduit bend is that the force factor of the flowing stream will increase or decrease in direct proportion to the size or degree of the angle. The conduit section 10 includes a housing 11, which is located at the bend in the conduit section.Inside the housing is a piston 12, which is designed to slide up or down within a chamber. The head of the piston 12 is provided with an O ring seal 13 which prevents fluid which is flowing through the conduit section from by passing the piston and leaking into the housing 11. The bottom surface of the piston head defines a face 14, which is in continuous contact with fluid flowing through the conduit section 10. The preferred configuration of face 14 is a hemispherical surface, as illustrated in Figure 1. However, this configuration is not critical to the practice of the invention. For example, the piston face may have other shapes, such as a concave, or flat face. Piston 12 also includes a piston rod 15, which is secured at its bottom end to the top of the piston head. A means for measuring the force exerted by the fluid stream is positioned inside of housing 11.There are several conventional force measuring or displacement devices which may be used for this purpose, such as pressure force transducers, linear voltage displacement transducers, fiber optic units, and the like. The force measuring device F which is schematically illustrated in Figure 1 is a conventional differential pressure transducer rather than units of pressure. The basic transducer, includes a bottom diaphragm 16 and a top diaphragm 17. Each diaphragm is fastened in the housing 11 by welding or any other suitable fastening means. The top end of the piston rod is a free end that is, unattached which is flush with the underside of the diaphragm 16. Positioned between each diaphragm is a cantilever beam sensor 18, which makes contact with both diaphragms. In turn, the beam sensor is connected to an electronic indicator 19, by electrical leads 20 and 21. The output from indicator 19 is transmitted to a computer not shown . The flow meter apparatus also includes a pressure equalization conduit section 22, for bringing the fluid pressure in the flow meter apparatus into equilibrium. A fluid inlet end 23 of conduit 22 opens into the larger conduit section 10 just ahead of the bend in the conduit section. Between the topside of piston 12 and the underside of diaphragm 16 is a space, which defines a lower compartment 24 in housing 11.The space between the topside of diaphragm 17 and the top end of housing 11 defines an upper compartment 25. Above the fluid inlet 23 is a short leg 26 of conduit 22. Part of the fluid from conduit 10 is directed through the short leg into compartment 24.The remaining part of the fluid which enters conduit 22 is directed into compartment 25 through a long leg 27. The flow meter device illustrated in Figure 2 is substantially identical to the flow meter device illustrated in Figure l, except for a modification in the structure of piston 12a which does not include the piston rod 15 of Figure 1. When it is desired to measure the flow rate of fluid streams which contain solids or corrosive materials, it is necessary to separate the stream flowing through the larger conduit 10 from the fluid in the pressure equalization conduit 22. This is done to prevent the corrosive materials in the stream from damaging the force measuring transducer unit and to prevent the solids from plugging off conduit 22. A separator means which may be used for this purpose is a small piston 28, as illustrated in Figure 3. An O ring 28a is fitted to the piston, to prevent fluid from by passing the piston. The first step in such an operation is to fill the conduit 22 with a clean fluid, that is, a fluid which does not contain solids or corrosive materials, or other contaminating substances. The piston and O ring are then inserted into the inlet end 23 of conduit 22.Thereafter, as the fluid which contains the damaging materials flows through the larger conduit 10, it pushes the piston separator up into the conduit 22 only a short distance, that is, until the fluid pressure on both sides of the piston reaches equilibrium. The apparatus illustrated in Figure 4 is designed to measure both the flow rate and density of a fluid stream. Although some of the parts in this view are similar to the parts shown in Figures 1 and 2, a different set of reference numerals are used. The larger conduit section 29 of this apparatus, includes a housing 30 forming an internal chamber 37, which is located at the bend in the conduit section. A lip 31 is defined at the point where the inner wall surface of the housing 30 is joined with the inner wall surface of conduit section 29. A thin plate 32 is fastened to the housing wall at the point where the lip is formed. The bottom surface of plate 32 defines a face 33 which is in continuous contact with fluid which flows through the conduit section 29. The preferred configuration for this face is a hemispherical surface, as shown but it may have other shapes, such as a concave, or flat face.A second conduit section 34 with a fluid inlet end 35 opens into conduit 29. The opposite end of conduit section 34 is a fluid outlet end 36, which opens into the chamber or compartment 37, which is defined in housing 30 above plate 32. A means 38 for measuring force exerted by a fluid stream moving through conduit 29 is positioned on the outside of housing 30. Any of the conventional force measuring, or displacement devices, such as the devices described earlier, may be used for this purpose.The force measuring device 38 preferably is an ultrasonic displacement transducer unit which is connected to an electronic indicater 39, by electrical leads 40 and 41.The output from indicator 39 is transmitted to a computer not shown . The present apparatus also includes a means for measuring the velocity of the fluid stream, as it moves through the conduit 29. Any of the various conventional devices designed for measuring velocity of fluid streams may be used for this purpose, such as certain types of transducer units, non intrusive flow meters, and the like. The velocity measuring device 42, which is illustrated schematically in Figure 4, preferably is an ultrasonic Doppler transducer unit. As shown in the drawing, the transducer 42 is mounted on the conduit section 29 upstream from the bend in the conduit. The transducer device is, in turn, connected by leads 43 and 44 to an electronic indicator 45. In practice, the output from indicator 45 is transmitted to a computer not shown . The present invention can be illustrated by describing certain operations in which the flow rate and density of moving fluid streams are measured.Typically, the apparatus is used to measure the flow rate of a fracturing slurry, which is usually a viscous liquid. Fracturing slurries are pumped into oil or gas wells, usually under high pressure, to initiate fracturing of earth formations and thus enhance recovery of the oil or gas. Referring to Figure 1, the slurry composition is pumped into the fluid inlet end of the conduit section 10 from a pipeline not shown which is connected to a pump unit not shown . After passing through the conduit section, the slurry is discharged through the fluid outlet into another pipeline not shown which carries it to the wellhead not shown .As the slurry stream flows through the conduit section 10, a part of the fluid flows through the pressure equalization conduit 22 into the upper compartment 25 through the long leg 27, and through the shorter leg 26 into the lower compartment 24. When the compartments 24 and 25 are completely filled, the fluid pressure against the top diaphragm 17, the bottom diaphragm 16, and the top face of piston 12, is equal to the fluid pressure exerted against the inside wall of conduit 10 and the fluid contact face 14 of the piston. By equalizing the fluid pressure in this flow meter system, the effect of the pressure factor on the flow rate measurement is nullified or removed. This leaves the system in a condition such that the flow rate can be determined by first measuring the force generated by the moving fluid, and then calculating the flow rate as a function of the force. During its flow through conduit 10, the fluid stream generates its maximum force vector as it rounds the 90 degree bend in the conduit. Accordingly, the force of the fluid, as it strikes against face 14 of piston 12, causes the piston to move upwardly in housing 11. In turn, the piston rod 15 deflects the diaphragm 16 against the arm of beam sensor 18. The pressure generated by the force on the piston is sensed by beam 18 and is picked up by strain gauges not shown attached to the beam. From the gauges, the force is transmitted as an electrical signal to the electrical indicator 19 and to a computer not shown , which derives the flow rate as a function of the forceDerivation of the flow rate is based on the following equation EMI11.1 where R flow rate K diameter of the conduit F force. In the device of Figure 2, the upward movement of piston 12a, in response to the force of the moving fluid stream, compresses the fluid in compartment 24a against diaphragm 16a. The resulting force against the diaphragm is then sensed by the transducer unit F in the same manner as described for the device ofFigure 1. In the operation of the flow meter and densitometer apparatus of Figure 4, a part of the fluid stream which flows through conduit 29 is directed into compartment 37 through the pressure equalization conduit 34, to equalize the fluid pressure in the system. As the fluid stream passes through conduit 29, it strikes the concave face of plate 32 and the force of the stream deflects the place upwardly toward the top of chamber 30. The resulting displacement of place 32 is sensed by the ultrasonic transducer 38. The transducer signal is picked up by the electronic indicator 39 and carried to a computer not shown , which derives the flow rate values. Along with its capability for measuring the flow rate of a moving fluid stream, this apparatus is designed for simultaneously measuring the density of the moving stream. As the fluid in conduit 29 flows past the Doppler transducer 42, the transducer measures the velocity of the moving stream. In turn, the transducer signal is picked up by the electronic indicator 45 and transmitted to a computer not shown . Using the velocity data, the computer is able to derive the density values according to the following equation F d d x v2 xa where F force d density v2 velocity of the fluid stream a area of the conduit. The plate 32 may be fabricated of any rigid, but flexible, material which is compatible with the fluids which are passed through the apparatus. Examples of suitable materials for this plate include stainless steel, non ferrous metals, plastic resins, certain rubber compounds, and the like. The thickness of the plate will depend on the actual pressure force of the fluids which are passed through this device. For example, the plate should be capable of withstanding fluid pressures up to at least 1400 kg cm2 20,000 psig and flow rates up to 11.8 m3 sec 25,000 SCFM .
