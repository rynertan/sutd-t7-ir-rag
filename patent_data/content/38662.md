# A power source arrangement for an electric discharge machine.

## Abstract
A power source arrangement for electric discharge machining in which a power source and a switching element are connected in parallel to an electrode and a work and the switching element is driven by a pulse signal of a predeter mined period from an oscillator OSC1 to perform electric discharge machining of the work. There is provided a pulse signal generator OSC2 to OSC4 and OR for generating such a pulse signal that the ratio of its OFF period to its ON period gradually increases with the lapse of time and a detector SD for detecting the occurrence of an arc or short in the spark gap between the electrode and the work. Upon detection of arcing or shorting in the spark gap by the detector SD, the pulse signal generator OSC2 to OSC4 and OR is activated so that the pulse signal of the predetermined period from the oscillator OSC1 to be applied to the switching element is gated at gate AND by the output pulse signal from the pulse signal generator OSC2 to OSC4 and OR until the arc or short is removed.
