# Memory device.

## Abstract
A method of determining the conductance state of a non volatile memory device switchable between high and low conductance states is provided. The device comprises at least one p type amorphous or microcrystalline semiconductor and an n or i type layer. The device is irradiated with light to produce a photovoltaic response which is used to determine the conductance state.
