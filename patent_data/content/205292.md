Whiting, European Journal of Pharmacology, This model is based on the method described by Herxheimer Br.J.Pharm.50, 314 1974 . Conscious guinea pigs Dunkin Hartley strain, 500 700g body weight were placed individually into a Perspex chamber of approximately 8 litres capacity, and the animals were challenged with an histamine aerosol. The standard histamine aerosol was generated using a Monaghan 675 ultrasonic nebulizer power setting 7 from a 5 x 10 ⁶m solution of histamine diphosphate in distilled water. After obtaining satisfactory aerosol generation, the aerosol was passed into the chamber for 10 seconds and the time was recorded from introduction of the aerosol until the guinea pig collapsed termed asphyxic collapse . In this way, the mean time to asphyxic collapse for a group of guinea pigs was determined. Compounds were administered orally to groups of animals number N and the degree of protection against histamine induced asphyxic collapse was determined by the percentage increase in mean time to asphyxic collapse of a compound treated group over that for asphyxic collapse for control groups. Compound treated animals that did not collapse were considered to be 100 protected. Compounds were administered in 1 methyl cellulose at a concentration of 5mg kg 1ml kg body weight and the animals were challenged with the standard histamine aerosol after 30 min. The significance of any increase in the mean asphyxic collapse time of a compound treated group of animals over that of a vehicle treated control group was determined using Student s t test. The results were as follows
