# Television scrambling and descrambling method and apparatus.

## Abstract
A television scrambling and descrambling system is disclosed. Transmitter circuit 16, 18 switch between any two consecutive segments of a signal causing delay times which differ from each other by a significant fraction of the horizontal sweep time, thereby scrambling the signal. Switches 40, 42 in the descrambler switch between consecutive time segments corresponding in number and complementary in delay times with the scrambler signal consecutive segments. Differences in the delays of the consecutive segments are provided in one arrangement by surface acoustic wave delay lines 22, 37 in one of at least two signal paths. In another case, a delay line comprising a charge coupled device CCD provides the consecutive signal segments having delay times which differ from each other. Horizontal retrace intervals are detected by a pulse generator 26 which drives the switching between paths or provides clock pulses for the CCD during the horizontal intervals. Switching information is modulated on to an interfering signal 28 which is demodulated by an AM demodulator 48 in the descrambler.

## Description
TELEVISION SCRAMBLING AND DESCRAMBLING METHOD AND APPARATUS This invention relates to a method and apparatus for preventing a television signal from being acceptably received by an unauthorised television receiver while maintaining the television signal recoverable by an authorised receiver. Subscription televison is now in wide and growing use in both cable television and over the air systems.In over the air systems, preventing unauthorised receivers from receiving the transmission is a major problem for subscription services, but even cable television systems might desire to have different classes of customers which can be serviced over the same cable.For instance, a special rate might be charged for customers who want to view certain sporting events or first run movies. In order to solve these problems, many systems have been developed for preventing the reception of an acceptable television signal by unauthorised receivers. Methods of scrambling and descrambling television signals to prevent unauthorised viewing of protected material have been proposed almost since the inception of television. Methods and apparatus from moving mirrors shown in U.S. Patent 2 531 974, to inserted carriers shown in U.S. Patent 4 074 311 have been proposed. Some systems in use today seek to modify the synchronisation pulses in the video signal as shown in U.S. Patent 3 924 059, or insert interfering video signals which are subsequently removed in the decrambling device as shown in U.S. Patent 4 112 464, or insert interfering carriers at the transmitter which are subsequently removed in the descrambling device with notch filters as shown in U.S.Patent 4 074 311. Randomised switching between inverted and non inverted video is expensive to perform in the decoder function, requiring demodulation of the received coded signal, and in the case of a set top decoder, the remodulation of the signal after it has been restored to viewable condition. While the systems using the method of injection of an interfering carrier do not require demodulation and remodulation, they have other disadvantages. Such systems can be easily defeated by persons with only modest means and effort. Extra transmitter power must be devoted to the interfering carrier. This is detrimental in cable systems, not so much for the slight penalty in consumed energy, but for the care and expense that are involved in maintaining linearity in all the amplifiers that must amplify the signals.The linearity problem becomes especially severe in over the air transmission systems because of the high transmitter power involved. Further, synchronisation pulse modification or suppression system techniques are easy to defeat. On the other hand these techniques lead to very effective scrambling and good quality pictures after descrambling.By combining this technique with the present invention, a scrambling descrambling system is obtained that is both secure and low in cost and delivers good quality descrambled video signals. According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a method of transmitting and receiving a television signal of the type having a plurality of horizontal sweeps occurring during a single vertical sweep, characterised by the steps of switching the television signal between at least two scrambling signal paths having delay times which differ from each other by a significant fraction of the horizontal sweep time so that display of an acceptable signal is impossible without compensating for the difference in delay times of the switched television signal transmitting the switched television signal receiving the switched television signal and switching the received television signal between at least two descrambling signal paths in a manner complementary to the switching between the scrambling signal paths whereby the total delay of any time segment of television signal through the combination of scrambling and descrambling signal paths substantially equals the total delay of any other time segment thereby compensating for the difference in delay times of the scrambling signal paths. According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a system for transmitting and receiving a television signal of the type having a plurality of horizontal sweeps occurring during a vertical sweep, characterised by a transmission network having at least two scrambler signal paths with delay times which differ from each other by a significant fraction of the horizontal sweep time means for switching the television signal between the scrambler signal paths means coupled to the output of the scrambler signal paths for recombining the switched television signal a transmitter coupled to the recombining means for transmitting the recombined, scrambled television signal a receiver for receiving the transmitted scrambled television signal descrambler signal paths in the receiver corresponding in number and complementary in delay times with the scrambler signal paths in the transmission network means coupled to the descrambler paths for switching the scrambled signal between the descrambler signal paths in a manner complementary to the switching of the television signal between the scrambler signal paths wherein the total delay through the entire system remains substantially constant and means for recombining the television signal from the descrambler signal paths to provide a usable descrambled television signal. Preferably, scrambling is accomplished by switching between signal paths during horizontal retrace to minimise the ffects of switching transients on the reconstructed picture. The delay times in the different signal paths differ from each other by a significant fraction of the horizontal sweep time. In a preferred form, at least part of the delay in one of the scrambler signal paths is due to a surface acoustic wave device in the signal path and a means for attenuating the signal is placed in another signal path to compensate for the attenuation caused by the surface acoustic wave device. In an alternative embodiment, a charge coupled device CCD , or similar variable delay line, may be used as the scrambler descrambler circuit. In that case, signals such as clock pulses are caused to vary the delay time of the CCD thus scrambling the output. By reversing the clock pulses at the receiver, the signal may be descrambled. Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein Figure 1 a schematic block diagram of a television scrambler for use in the present invention Figure 2 is a schematic block diagram of a television descrambler for use in the present invention and Figure 3 is a schematic block diagram of an alternative embodiment of a scrambler descrambler device using a charge coupled device. Referring now to Figure 1 of the drawings, a system for transmitting and receiving a television signal according to the present invention includes apparatus 10 for preventing a television signal of the ordinary type having a plurality of vertically spaced horizontal sweeps from being acceptably received by an unauthorised television receiver while maintaining the television signal recoverable by an authorised receiver. In one embodiment, the apparatus 10 includes at least two scrambler signal paths 12 and 14, and means for switching the television signal between the signal paths including switches 16 and 18. Means 20, which in this case is a mere wiring connection, recombines the television signal from the scrambler signal paths 12 and 14. A transmitter 21 then transmits the recombined television signal.The delay time through the scrambler signal path 12 differs from the delay through the scrambler signal path 14 by a significant fraction of the horizontal sweep time. In the United States, for instance, the time from the start of one horizontal line to the start of the next horizontal line is approximately 60 microseconds and the horizontal interval is approximately 10 microseconds. In such a system, a typical preferred range for difference in delay times between the signal paths 12 and 14 would be between approximately 3 and 5 microseconds. The first path 12 includes a surface acoustic wave device 22 in the signal path to act as a delay line, and the second path 14 includes means 24 for attenuating the signal to compensate for the attenuation caused by the surface acoustic wave device in the first path. The apparatus 10 further includes means 26 for detecting the presence of intervals between horizontal sweeps, and in this particular case for detecting the television horizontal synchronisation pulse. The means 26 also acts as a pulse generator for driving the switches 16 and 18, switching the television signal between the scrambler signal paths during a horizontal interval. The pulse generating means 26 also drives an interfering signal generator 28 by AM modulating the interfering signal. Otherwise the interfering signal generator operates on the recombined television signal through summing means 30 in a manner well known in the art and described in U.S. Patent No. 4 074 311.By modulating the interfering signal with pulse generating means 26 for detecting horizontal intervals, the information for synchronising the received signal with the transmitted signal which describes the switch times of the time segments of the scrambling signal paths is transmitted along with the television signal. Referring now to Figure 2, a descrambler for use in the present invention is referred to generally by reference numeral 31. The scrambled television signal is received by a receiver 32. It passes through a radio frequency amplifier 34 to descrambler signal paths 36 and 38 which correspond in number to the scrambler signal paths 12 and 14. In the case illustrated, the difference in the time delay between the descrambler signal path 36 and the descrambler signal path 38 is the same as the time difference between the two scrambler signal paths so that the time delay through the scrambler signal path 38 is complementary to the time delay through the scrambler signal path 12, and the time delay through the descrambler signal path 36 is complementary to the time delay through the scrambler signal path 14.This is easily accomplished by including a surface acoustic wave delay line 37 in the path 36 which matches the surface acoustic delay line 22, and by including an attenuator 39 in the path 38 which matches the loss in the delay line 37. Means including a switch 40 in the descrambler signal path 36 and a switch 42 in the descrambler signal path 38 switch between the descrambler signal paths in a manner complementary to the switching between the two or more scrambler signal paths. The total delay through the entire system thus remains substantially constant. A time segment of the signal which travels through the scrambler signal path 12 thus travels through the descrambler signal path 38, and the time segment of the signal which travels through the scrambler signal path 14 travels through the descrambler signal path 36.Each time segment of the signal thus travels through a comparable surface acoustic wave delay line and attenuator. The interfering signal which was generated by the interfering signal generator 28 is picked off by a filter 44 and is amplified or buffered through an amplifier 46 before the information describing the switch times of the time segments of the two or more scrambling signal paths is interpreted by an AM demodulator 48. The switching information is then buffered and shaped by amplifiers 50 and 52 which in turn drive the switches 40 and 42. Means such as a wiring connection 54 recombines the television signal from the descrambler signal paths 36 and 38.Finally, the descrambled and recombined signal is passed through a notch filter 56 which removes the interfering signal, as described in U.S. Patent No. 4 074 311. It can thus be seen that switching is effected between the various paths during the horizontal retrace to minimise the effects of switching transients on the reconstructed picture. The effect of the scrambling is then to shift portions of the picture to the left or right by an amount proportional to the difference in delay between the two paths. The television set of an unauthorised viewer then presents a picture which has portions of the picture displaced horizontally.Typically several lines are transmitted through a given path before the other path is selected. If the number of lines in each path is then selected on a pseudo random basis which is asynchronous with the television field or frame rate, it becomes impossible to ascertain even the nature of the picture being transmitted. There are several ways that the switching information can be provided to the demodulator. A switching signal could be modulated on the audio carrier, on additional carriers used as jammers, or on separate pilot tones transmitted at another frequency. The picture carrier frequency or phase could be modulated with switching information. A code could be transmitted during the vertical interval which the receiving apparatus could decode to operate subsequent fields or frames. The delays in some of the scrambler and descrambler paths can be implemented at radio frequencies, obviating demodulation and remodulation of the video signal in add on descrambler boxes for use in homes. Demodulation and remodulation not only add to the unit cost of descramblers, but deteriorate the picture quality as well. Surface acoustic wave SAW devices have excellent repeatability, necessary for accurate reproduction of the original picture. In large quantities, SAW devices can be manufactured at relatively low cost. A scrambler system which uses this technique is relatively safe from pirates who manufacture and sell descramblers directly to potential users, thus depriving the programme provider of anticipated income. In order to manufacture an effective descrambler, the pirate would have to obtain SAW devices matched to the delays used in the transmitter. Barring the availability of SAW devices, the pirate would have to use coaxial cable or other electromagnetic transmission lines. Typically, several thousand feet of cable would be required to match the delay of the SAW devices anticipated. To reproduce the SAW devices requires a substantial investment, which could be recovered only by selling a large number of descramblers. Sellers of large numbers are relatively easy to trace and to apprehend. Figure 3 illustrates an alternative embodiment of a circuit which may be used in the transmitter as the scrambler or in the receiver as the descrambler, and replacing the circuitry 67 in Figures 1 and 2. As is well known in the art, the charge coupled device 58 in Figure 3 may be caused to delay an input signal on a line 64 by varying the clock pulses applied to lines designated as Q and Q. Thus, if for a first period of time the clock pulses applied to a line 60 were of a first frequency and then for a second period of time the clock pulses were applied to a line 62 at a different frequency, and those time periods were randomly selected, the output signal on a line 66 would be scrambled. Thus, scrambling of the television signal occurs by switching consequentive segments of the television signal between at least two delay times which differ from each other by a significant fraction of the horizontal sweep time. The display of an acceptable signal is then impossible without compensating for the difference in delay times of the switched television signal. When the scrambled signal is received, descrambling occurs by switching the delay times of the received consecutive segments in a manner complementary to the switching of the segments in the transmitted signal wherein the total time delay of any of the consecutive segments of the television signal through the scrambling and descrambling circuits substantially equals the total delay of any other time segment. Thus the difference in delay times of the segments of the transmitted signal is compensated for by the complementary delay time occurring in the receiver. By reversing the process at the receiver, that is, by reversing the clock pulse frequencies applied to theCCD, the signal could be descrambled. It is understood by those skilled in the art that CCD s operate at a lower frequency than SAW devices and will therefore require the use of demodulators to translate frequencies into the frequency range of the CCD. It is also understood by those skilled in the art that the function of the CCD can be provided by means of an A D converter, digital shift registers and D A converters connected in tandem.
