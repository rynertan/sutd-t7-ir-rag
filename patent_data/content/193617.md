# NOZZLE TOUCH MECHANISM.

## Abstract
A nozzle touch mechanism for pressing a nozzle 3 of an injection apparatus 1 onto a metal mold 4 , wherein the nozzle 3 is pressed onto the metal mold with a simple mechanism. A threaded portion 11a of a ball screw 11 of the mechanism is threaded into a ball nut 13 fastened to a pressure plate 12 that moves said injection apparatus 1 via springs 15a, 15b . The threaded portion 11a is un screwed from said ball nut 13 at a position where the springs 15a, 15b are deflected such that the nozzle 3 is pressed onto the metal mold 4 with a proper pressing force. At this position, the nozzle 3 is pressed onto the metal mold 4 by the deflected springs 15a, 15b that hold the injection apparatus 1 .
