# Connector for printed circuit boards.

## Abstract
Daughter board to mother board connector 2 compris es an elongate dielectric housing 10 having perpendicular faces 18, 19 which mount against respective boards 4, 7 over parallel rows of contact pads 5, 8 . Housing 10 has a plurality of parallel planar recesses 22 which open on the faces 18, 19 and receive flat contacts 30 . Contacts 30 have rectangular apertures 32 which align with an axial opening 14 through the housing. An insulated keying shaft 50 having a square profile is contained in the opening 14 and fits closely through the apertures 32 so that rotating the shaft 50 effects rotation of the contacts 30 . Each contact 30 is a plate cam 50 having lobes 40, 40 which wipe across the pads 41,41 as the shaft 50 rotates causing the cam 30 to translate transversely of the axis of the shaft 50 as parallel walls 33 of the aperture 32 slide across parallel surfaces 52 of the shaft 50 . A spring 27 nested in each recess 22 opposite the faces 18, 19 deflects resiliently to cause contact pressure which is enhanced by an additional lobe 44 facing the spring 27 .
