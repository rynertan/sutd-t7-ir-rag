# A current sensing circuit for motor controls.

## Abstract
A current sensing circuit includes an impedance network 2, 3 having a capacitor 2 which produces a voltage proportional to the steady state component of current and an inductance 3 which produces a voltage proportional to the transient component. The capacitor voltage modulates a carrier signal which conveys the steady state component through an isolation transformer 14 to a demodulator 31 . The transient component is conveyed through a second isolation transformer 5 and is summed with the demod ulated steady state component.
