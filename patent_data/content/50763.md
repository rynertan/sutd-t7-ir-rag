# Cardiovascular valvular prosthesis and manufacturing process of same.

## Abstract
The invention refers to a cardiovascular valvular prosthesis, of the type that comprises a suture textile ring arranged surrounding the perimetral groove of a support on which an occluding disc is assembled. The invention is characterised by the fact that said support is constituted by an integral piece, of annular shape, on one of the edges of which is projected a radially directed support arm that ends in a terminal directed toward the internal portion of same, said arm is complemented with a pair of projections symmetrically arranged with respect to same, that face the opposite edge of said annular piece according to a virtual cord of same determined between the diameter of the piece and the beginning of the above mentioned radially directed arm between the terminals of said arms and of said projections the occluding disc is adapted, free to rotate, that on the surface facing the above mentioned arm has a circular depression the edge of which forms a support step of the above mentioned terminal of said arm, the textile ring adapted in the outside portion of said perimetral groove of the support is constituted by a length of a tubular piece of fabric that has its perimetral edges joined by means of longitudinal seam disposed against said groove.
