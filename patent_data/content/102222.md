# Loop transmission system and method of controlling its loop back condition.

## Abstract
A loop transmission system comprises a plurality of node stations ND A...ND D , a supervisory station SV , and two duplicate loop transmission lines TL1, TL2 which transmit signals in opposite directions. In operation of the system, the supervisory station sends out loop back com mands LB 0 ON, LB 1 ON via both of the duplicate loop transmission lines when faults are detected on both of the transmission lines at the same time. Upon receipt of a loop back command, each of the node stations establishes a loop back path TLC while retaining a connection path to a succeeding note station. The supervisory station then sends release commands LB 0 OFF, LB 1 OFF to the node stations, and the loop back path is released only in those node stations which receive signals normally from both of the duplicate loop transmission lines.
