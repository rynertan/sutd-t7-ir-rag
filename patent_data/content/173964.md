## Description
This invention relates to a biocidal fine powder having a notably reinforced biological effect, to its manufacturing method and to a suspension for agricultural use containing the above powder. Biocidal agents such as insecticides, germicides, herbicides and miticides are effectively insoluble in water. Therefor they are used in an aqueous fluid suspension. As compared to an emulsion prepared by dissolving a biocidal agent in an organic solvent such as xylene or kerosene, a fluid suspension has advantages in terms of its storage, cost, environmental pollution and phytotoxicity to crops. In addition, a fluid suspension can be prepared even when there is no proper organic solvents for the biocidal agent. And, a fluid suspension is a form most suitable for spraying. As described above, fluid suspensions of biocidal agents have several advantages and various studies have been carried out in order to improve their quality. Nevertheless, a fluid suspension of satisfactory quality has not yet been achieved because of caking and increased viscosity caused when it is stored over a prolonged period. After an earnest study it was found that it is possible to produce a biocidal fine powder containing at least 50 wt of particles with diameter of 0.5 micron or less by mixing a dispersion liquid of a biocidal substance with rigid media having particle diameter of 0.5 mm or less and that the thus obtained biocidal fine powder exhibits a notably reinforced biological activity. The inventors have further found that use of the thus obtained biocidal fine powder as the active agent enables a suspension for agricultural use to be produced which has both a high biological effect and prolonged stability. Because, no bottom hard caking or increased viscosity are caused by natural precipitation of the biocidal substance. Thus this invention has been completed. That is to say, this invention provides a biocidal fine powder containing at least 50 wt of particles with diameter of 0.5 µm or below, its manufacturing method and a suspension for agricultural use containing the above powder. The biocidal fine powder of this invention contains at least 50 wt of particles with diameter of 0.5 µm or less. It is preferable that the biocidal fine powder of this invention contains at least 50 wt of particles with diameter of 0.5 µm or less and that the average diameter of the particles in the powder is 0.5 µm or less. It is specially preferable that the powder contains at least 70 wt of particles with diameter of 0.5 micron or less and that the average diameter of the particles in the powder is 0.4 µm or less. The biocidal substance usable in this invention is insoluble in water and includes any biocidal agent which is solid or pasty at room temperature. Any biocidal agent when pulverized according to the method of this invention comes to have an excellent biological effect which could not have been achieved by the conventional method of preparation. It is possible to prepare the above biocidal substance by combining at least two biocidal agents having different structures. The following germicides, herbicides, insecticides and miticides or tickicides are listed as water insoluble biocidal agents which are solid or pasty at ordinary temperature.

The biocidal fine powder of this invention is manufactured by mixing a dispersion liquid of a biocidal substance with rigid media having particle diameter of 0.5 mm or less. A commercially available powder may be used as a biocidal substance in preparing the above dispersion liquid for this invention or a commercially available dispersion liquid may be used. It is preferable that the concentration of the biocidal substance in the dispersion liquid is in the range of 5 to 70 wt and a high concentration of the biocidal substance is specially preferable in order to achieve high manufacturing efficiency. It is preferable that the particle diameter of the media used in this invention is 0.5 mm or less preferably in the range of 0.05 to 0.5 mm. The material for the media may be a rigid member such as Ottawa sand, glass, alumina or zircon and is preferably a glass member. A sand mill, a sand grinder or similar apparatus can be used in pulverizing a mixture containing the biocidal substance and the media. A sand mill or a sand grinder used for this invention may be a generally well known one of either the vertical type or the horizontal type. A disk used for this invention may also be of the usual type. It is preferable that a temperature of 5 to 30 C is maintained during the pulverization. A temperature exceeding 30 C is not favorable because the pulverization can be performed only with difficulty because a long time is needed for the pulverization. When performing the pulverization, the ratio by volume of the media to the biocidal substance is in the range of 40 60 to 80 20 preferably in the range of 60 40 to 70 30. The biocidal fine powder according to this invention is obtained by pulverizing the aforementioned mixture by means of a sand mill before the media are separated from the biocidal dispersion liquid by pressure filtration or ultracentrifugation and then washing the media by water as needed. When performing the above pulverization, the efficiency of the pulverization can be increased by adding a proper dispersing agent to the dispersion liquid of a biocidal substance. The following compounds 1 to 3 are listed as specially favorable dispersing agents. One of these compounds may be used alone or at least two of them may be used in combination. An alkali metal such as sodium or potassium, an alkaline earth metal such as calcium as well as an amine and an ammonium salt can be used as salts. It is preferable that at least 0.1 wt , preferably 0.5 to 10 wt , of the above dispersing agents 1 to 3 is added to the dispersion liquid of a biocidal substance in preparing the biocidal fine powder. The thus obtained biocidal powder contains at least 50 wt of particles with diameter of 0.5 micron or less. Particle diameters and their distribution were measured by a centrifugal automatic size distribution measuring device CAPA 500 manufactured by Horiba Seisakusho same as in examples . A dispersion liquid containing the biocidal powder has a remarkably improved dispersion stability as compared to the conventional dispersion liquid containing a biocidal substance of large particle diameter. In addition, the dispersion liquid of this invention can be very advantageously used as an agricultural agent because of having a higher biological effect than the conventional dispersion liquid containing a biocidal substance. Although the suspension of this invention for agricultural use has good dispersion stability, it is possible to add a water soluble thickener, a dispersing agent, an anti foaming agent, a decomposition preventing agent, an aggregation preventing agent, an adjuvant or a similar agent as needed. The addition of a compound selected from among the following compounds i to ii as an adjuvant, is specially favorable because a further increased biological effect of the agricultural agent of this invention can be achieved. Compounds specified in the following items 1 to 9 are listed as preferable examples. There is no special restriction to the method of preparing this compound and it is manufactured by a generally well known method. For example, the compound is prepared by adding an alkylene oxide to an alcohol or an alkyl phenol before the addition product is caused to react with phosphorus pentoxide, then neutralizing the reaction product as needed. The alcohol used as the starting material has either a straight chain or branched chain alkyl group containing 1 to 2 carbon atoms or an alkenyl group or a hydroxyalkyl group containing double bonds or hydroxyl groups in the chain. it is preferable that the alcohol contains 4 to 18 carbon atoms, contains 0 to 4 preferably 0 to 2 double bonds and contains 0 to 4 preferably 0 to 2 hydroxyl groups. Compounds such as butanol, 2 ethyl hexanol, lauryl alcohol, stearyl alcohol and oleyl alcohol are listed as alcohols used for this invention. It is preferable that the above alkyl phenol has an alkyl group containing 4 to 18 carbon atoms. Ethylene oxide, propylene oxide and butylene oxide are listed as alkylene oxides which can be added to the alcohol to form a polyoxyalkylene chain. Each of these compounds may be used alone or at least two of them may be subjected to the addition of block or random polymers. The number of moles of alkylene oxides added is 1 to 100, preferably 1 to 50. The above addition reaction can be performed by a well known method, for example, by introducing an alkylene oxide at 50 to 200 C in a pressure of 1 to 5 kg cm² under the presence of an acid or alkali catalyst so as to cause the alkylene oxide to react with the mixture. There are several methods for phosphorylating a polyoxyalkylene alkyl or alkylphenol ether. For example, a phosphoric ester can be easily prepared by mixing 3 moles of a polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether with 1 mole of phosphorus pentoxide and subjecting the mixture to reaction at 80 to 100 C for about 6 hours. The thus obtained polyoxyalkylene alkyl or alkylphenol ether phosphoric ester is a mixture composed of equal amounts of a monoester and a diester. Both of a monoester or a diester exhibit a superior effect as an adjuvant for this invention. Especially, a monoester such as polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether phosphoric monoester or its salt exhibits a superior effect. Furthermore, a polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether phosphoric ester salt is obtained by neutralizing the above phosphoric ester by means of a base. The thus obtained phosphoric ester salt also has a superior effect of increasing the biological effect of the agricultural agent of this invention. For the above salt, alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts, monoethanolamine salts, diethanolamine salts, triethanolamine salts and ammonium salts are listed. In this invention, the ratio by weight of the biocidal powder to a compound selected from groups i o ii is at least 1 0.05 to 20, and is preferably 1 0.2 to 20 and more preferably 1 0.5 to 15. In addition to polymer compounds already described in the granulation method, a non ionic surface active agent or and an anionic surface active agent can be used as dispersion agent s added in preparing the aforementioned agricultural agent of this invention. For the above non ionic surface active agent, polyoxyethylene hereafter abbreviated as POE alkyl containing 6 to 22 carbon atoms ether, POE alkyl containing 4 to 18 carbon atoms phenolether, polyoxypropylene polyoxyethylene block or random alkylether, POE phenylphenol ether, POE styrenated phenolether and POE tribenzyl phenolether are listed. For the above anionic surface active agent, lignin sulfonate, alkylbenzene sulfonate, alkylsulfonate, POE alkyl sulfonate, POE alkyl phenylether sulfonate, POE alkyl phenylether phosphoric ester salt, POE phenyl phenolether sulfonate, POE phenyl phenolether phosphoric ester, naphthalene sulfonate, naphthalenesulfonic acid formalin condensate, POE tribenzyl phenolether sulfonate and POE tribenzylphenyl phenolether phosphoric ester salt are listed. One of these compounds may be used alone or one of their mixtures may be used. The concentration of the above surface active agents in the agricultural agent is 0 to 20 wt , preferably 1 to 10 wt . For a water soluble thickener, any of natural, semisynthetic and synthetic thickeners can be used. Xanthan Gum and Zanflo derived from microorganisms as well as pectin, gum arabic and Guar rubber derived from plants are listed as natural thickeners. The methylation products, carboxyalkylation products and hydroxyalkylation products including methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose and hydroxymethylcellulose of cellulose or starch derivatives are listed as semisynthetic thickeners. Polyacrylates, polymaleinates and polyvinyl pyrrolidone are listed as synthetic thickeners. The concentration of the water soluble thickener in the agricultural agent is about 0 to 3.0 wt , preferably about 0.05 to 0.5 wt . It is preferable, in some cases, that up to about 2 wt of an anti foaming agent is added in manufacturing the agricultural agent in order to prevent any foaming of the agent during its manufacturing. It is also preferable that up to about 7 wt of a decomposition preventing agent is contained especially in an organic phosphorus system biocidal agent in order to prevent its decomposition during its storage. There is no special restriction to the anti foaming agent used in this invention, and propylene glycol and silicone oil are listed as anti foaming agents. For the decomposition preventing agent used in this invention, epichlorohydrin, phenylglycidyl ether and allylglycidyl ether are listed. In addition to these agents, it is possible to add an agglutination preventing agent for a solid biocidal agent such as polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene block polymer as well as a drift preventing agent such as sorbitol as desired. An example of the agricultural agent of this invention is as follows. When preparing the agricultural agent of this invention, there is no special restriction to the order of adding the components. The mechanism of the reinforced biological effect of the biocidal fine powder according to this invention has not been clarified. The notably increased biological activity of the biocidal fine powder is considered to be due to the phenomenon that minute particles of the powder can easily intrude through air holes existing on the surfaces of leaves as well as through small cracks of the cuticular layer. Furthermore, since the suspension of this invention for agricultural use contains as an adjuvant a compound selected from groups specified in i to ii which has a very strong ability of solubilizing the biocidal agent, it is estimated that the particle diameter of the biocidal fine powder is further decreased by the use of the above adjuvant and the biocidal fine powder with further decreased particle diameter can more promptly permeate through the surfaces of plants as well into insect bodies and microbe cells. Owing to the advent of this invention, it became possible to manufacture a biocidal fine powder containing at least 50 wt of particles with diameter of 0.5 micron or less. The thus obtained biocidal fine powder has a higher biological effect compared to the conventional biocidal powder of large particle diameter. Thus, a suspension for agricultural use containing the biocidal fine powder of this invention has good dispersion stability and an excellent biological effect.
