# Wire guidance system.

## Abstract
Routing decisions for vehicles following current carrying guidewires and carrying destination addresses are made at intersections of a guidewire system without the need for storing large amounts of data at the intersections by making inequality and equality comparisons of destination addresses with one or a few numbers stored at each intersection and basing routing on the results of one or a combination of two such comparisons.
