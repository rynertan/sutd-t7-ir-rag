# Digital signal repeater including means for controlling a transmitter.

## Abstract
A digital signal repeater has a receiver for receiving a modulated carrier wave and demodulating a digital signal, a transmitter for transmitting a carrier wave modulated by the digital signal, and a controller responsive to the output of the receiver for providing a control signal controlling the transmit ting operation of the transmitter, the controller including first decision means for detecting the level of the modulated carrier wave of an intermediate frequency band of the receiver and providing a first signal, second decision means for detecting a clock frequency component in the output of the receiver and providing a second signal, logic means responsive to the first and second signals for providing a third signal. first means for smoothing the third signal, and comparator means for compar ing the output of the first means with a reference level and providing the control signal.
