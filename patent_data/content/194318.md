# METHOD OF CONSTITUTING A DIGITAL FILTER.

## Abstract
A method of constituting a digital filter which does not form in the circuit a loop that excludes delay elements, which has a low coefficient of sensitivity and a low sensitivity for the internal operation word length. First, a node or closed circuit equation of an analog filter which is to be converted into a digital filter, is subjected to S Z conversion to convert it into an equation which is mapped on a Z plane. The digital filter to be found is constituted by using the equation mapped on the Z plane as an equation which has a delay to give a node voltage or a closed circuit current. The digital filter can also be found by converting the inductance of the analog filter into an equivalent circuit which consists of a resistance and a capacitance having positive and negative values, and by using the node or closed circuit equation of this equivalent circuit.

## Description
DESCRIPTION The present invention relates to a digital filter having reduced coefficient sensitivity and reduced sensitivity to internal operation word length. With the rapid progress of recent IC technologies, various commuinication equipments have been digitized relatively with ease to enable enormous and versatile information processing to be effected. Especially, digital filters have gradually taken the place of analog filters with very frequent use in digital signal processing. A digital filter comprises in general three types of basic elements address, multipliers, and delay elements which are defined by a difference equation. This difference equation is derived with proper transformation of variables of an LCR analog filter as shown in DigitalFilters Analysis and Design by A. Antoniou, McGrawHill, Inc. 1979. The digital filter so obtained frequently causes a delay free loop hereinafter abbreviated as DFL and thus impossible to act as a filter. In addition, the digital filter, owing to its high sensitivity to a filter coefficient and an internal operation word length, is increased in the coefficient word length and the internal operation word length. In view of the drawbacks with the conventional filter, it is an object of the present invention to provide a digital filter without DFL. To achieve the above object, a digital filter according to the present invention having adder means, multiplier means, and delay means in combination includes a means for estimation a node equation or a closed circuit equation to transform an analog filter to the digital filter, a means for subjecting these equations to S Z transformation to map them on a Z plane, and a means for transforming the equations mapped on the Z plane to equations each having mode voltage or closed circuit currents and having any delay, the equation so having any delay and presenting the mode voltage providing the combination of the adder means, multiplier means, and delay means.

A first embodiment of a digital filter according to the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. Referring to Fig. 1 illustrating arrangement of an LC analog filter, a node equation of the filter is expressed in general by the following equation 1 . EMI6.1 Here, Yij is given by the following equation 2 in terms of conductance Gij, capacitance Cij, and inductanceLij l Yij Gij sCij 2 sLij In the figure, designated at E is electromotive force, R0 is equal to 1 Go, RL is terminal resistance, andVi i 1, 2, ..., n is node voltage. The equation 1 can be given by the following equation 3 by use of the equation 2 .EMI7.1 Then, let us execute the following bilinear s z transformationEMI7.2 for the equation 3 , where s is a complex variable of a transfer function HA s of an analog filter, z is an complex variable of a transfer function HD z of a digital filter, and T indicates a sampling interval. Substituting the equation 4 for the equation 3 and putting it in order,EMI8.1 is obtained. Assuming hereEMI8.2 multiplying both sides of the equation, 5 by the inverse matrix A 1 of A ,EMI8.3 is obtained. Furtheremore, putting 6 in order and transforming it to a form to derive node voltage V, V 1 z 2 B E z 1 C V z 2 D V 7 EMI8.4 i,j elements of the matrices B , C , and D are assumed respectively to be bij, Cij, and dij n equations are involved in the equation 7 , and the k th equation thereamong is expressible asEMI9.1 A difference equation is obtained from this asEMI9.2 where u mT and e mT are inverse z transformation of Vk z and E z .The equation 9 is provided to derive uk mT from u m 1 T, vj m 2 T j 1, 2, ..., n and e mT e m 2 T and can be represented by a circuit composed of the delay element 1, adder means 2, and multiplier means 3 of Fig. 2. Thus, the equation 7 provides n circuits to derive vk mT for k from 1 to n, and forms the digital filter shown in Fig. 3 with addition of delay elements. It is obvious from Fig. 3 and the equation 9 that j at the same time, i.e., j mT is not needed to provide arbitrary uk mT . Namely, a digital filter can be constructed without causing DFL. In addition, the above construction method can be applied to an analog filter employing a circuit element having a dimension of the square of s or more which can be transformed to an LCR filter by use of impedance scaling. Moreover, a digital filter without DFL can be assured in the same manner even with use of another known s z transformation, e.g., s z1 l z l , s l z l, s z2 alpha z 1 z2 1 instead of the s z transformation of the expression 4 . Let us then describe an example wherein a fifth polarized low pass filter shown in Fig. 4 is transformed to a digital filter, based on the procedure given in the first embodiment of the present invention. An analog transfer function HA s of the fifth polarized low pass filter of Fig. 4 cut off frequency 1MHzr allowable ripple contents of the pass band 0.28dB, attenuation pole frequencies 1.369345MHz and 1.988127MRz is given asEMI10.1 where A2 0.01991716490 A4 8.656982093 x 10 5 B1 0.4692808372 B2 0.1158863247 B3 0.02345920748 B4 2.200704185 x 10 3 B5 2.594782157 x 10 4 Effecting the bilinear s z transformation shown in the equation 4 for the analog transfer function HA s , frequency distortion is caused between the analog frequency and the digital frequency.A relation A T D T tan 11 2 holds at that time between a circular frequency uA in the analogregion and that xD in the digital region, as shown in Fig. 5. The frequency axis of the analog filter is previously changed to eliminate the influence of nonlinear distortion on the frequency. Namely, to permit the cut off frequency of a digital filter designed with use of the equation 11 to get a desired frequency, element parameters of the analog filter are altered to shift the cut off frequency.In the example described above, assuming a sampling periodT 0.1 S , the cut off frequency f Aof the analog filter must satisfy A tan DT 1.03425152 MHz from the equation 11 to obtain the cut off frequency fD 1MHzof the digital filter. For this purpose, capacitance and inductance of the circuit of Fig. 4 must be multiplied by D A. Fig. 6 shows the circuit so obtained. The node equation is then given as EMI12.1 where Go 1 R0. Effecting the bilinear s z transformation for the equation 14 and putting them in order with use of the procedure described above,EMI13.1 Here, Go 10 3. Fig. 7 shows values of the coefficients bij, Cijr and dij. As shown in Fig. 8, a digital filter is constructed following three difference equations yielded from the equation 1 3 . Let us compare here a logarithmic amplitude characteristic of the original fifth polarized low pass filter of Fig. 4 with that of the digital filter of Fig.8.a. Logarithmic Amplitude Characteristic of OriginalFifth Low Pass Filter. Frequency distortion of the transfer function HA s in.the s region of the equation 10 produced owing to the vilinear s z transformation is previously corrected as described before, and then subjected to the bilinear s z transformation. After substituting the resultant transfer functionHD z in the z region for z e 14 the logarithmic amplitude characteristic can be obtained with use of 20log1QlHD eje dB . The result is shown inFig. 9.b. Logarithmic Amplitude characteristic of Digital FilterShown in Fig. 8. A unit sample series is entered into the imput of the digital filter shown in Fig. 8 to provide an impulse response, which is then subjected to fast Fourier transformation whereby the logarithmic amplitude characteristic can be estimated. Fig. 10 shows the logarithmic amplitude characteristic with the filter coefficient of 32 bits. But, a coefficient of the digital filter is represented with use of a binary floating point, and only a fixed point part thereof is rounded to a designated word length. For an internal operation format, a single accuracy real number format of a floating point exponent 8 bits fixed point part 24 bits is employed. As shown in Figs. 9 and 10, the amplitude characteristic of the first embodiment of a digital filter according to the present invention is very excellently coincides with that of the original analog filter. Then, let us describe coefficient sensitivity of the digital filter. A digital filter shown in fig. 8 is yielded by applying a filter construction method according to the present invention, the fifth polarized low pass filter shown in Fig. 4 as described above and changes of the logarithmic amplitude characteristic of the digital filter with respect to word lengths of the multiplication coefficient thereof are shown in Fig. 11. Fig. 12 shows an exemprary digital filter yielded by transforming the fifth polarized low pass filter described above to a secondary cascade digital filter being a typical of conventional arrangement. The secondary cascade digital filter is constructed based on a transfer function EMI16.1 yielded by transforming the transfer function shown by the equation 10 to a transfer function in the s region by the bilinear transformation of the equation 4 , and further to become a product of the quadratic expresion.Each coefficient is as shown in Fig. 12. Fig.13 shows the behavior of logarithmic amplitude characteristics of the secondary cascade digital filter with respect to the word lengths thereof. It is evident from the comparison of Fig. 11 with Fig.13 that the characteristic of the first embodiment of the digital filter according to the present invention is more ideal than that of the conventional secondary cascade digital filter under the same word length and thus coefficient sensitivity of the former is lower than that of the latter. Let us describe in succession sensitivity of the digital filter with respect to the internal operation word length thereof. Fig. 14 shows relative error err between gains of the digital filter of Fig. 8 and the secondary cascade digital filter of Fig. 12 as internal operation word lengths thereof are reduced. The relative error err is here shown by EMI17.1 where N a number of samples in the pass band, GAo gain dB of the pass band of a reference filter in case of no limitation to the coefficient word length and the internal operation word length , and GA gain dB of a filter to be compared. It is clearly shown from Fig. 14 that the first embodiment of the digital filter according to the present invention can be reduced in sensitivity to the internal operation word length as compared with the conventional cascade digital filter. Although the first embodiment of the digital filter according to the present invention is constructed as a digital filter having in combination delay means, adder means, and multiplier means based on an equation capable of delaying any concerning signal, with the use of which equation a node equation of the analog filter is s z transformed to provide node voltage, the arrangement of the digital filter can be assured also from a closed circuit equation of the analog filter. Let us here describe a second embodiment of the digital filter according to the present invention wherein the digital filter is constructed based on a closed circuit equation of the analog filter. The second embodiment will be provided following procedures described below. The closed circuit equation of an LC analog filter shown in Fig. 15 is represented in general byEMI18.1 Here, Zij in the above equation can be expressed by l Zij Rij sLij 22 sCij in terms of resistance Rij, capacitance Cij and inductance Lij. In addition, E is electromotive force, Ri internal registance, and Ii i 1, 2 n a closed circuit current independent from each other. The above equation 21 can be expressed asEMI18.2 by using the expression 22 , whereEMI18.3 Then, bilinear s z transformation l z 1 s 2 T 24 l z 1 is applied to the equation 23 . Here s, represents a complex variable of the transfer function HA s of the analog filter, z a complex variable of the transfer function HD z of the digital filter, and T a sampling interval. Moreover, substituting the equation 24 for the equation 23 and putting it in order,EMI19.1 is yielded.EMI19.2 and multiplying both sides of the equation by the inverse matrix A 1 of the matrix A from the left,EMI19.3 is obtained. In addition, putting this in order and transforming this into a form to derive the closed circuit current 1 z 2 B E z 1 C z 2 D 27 is yielded, whereEMI20.1 Moreover, i, j elements of the matrixes B , C , and D are assumed to the bij, C and dij respectively. The matrix 27 includes n equations, the kth one among which is given asEMI20.2 A difference equation derived from this equation is ik mT bklG0te mT e m EMI20.3 Here, ik mT and e mT are respectively inverse z transformations of I z and E z . The equation 29 serves to evaluate ik mT from j m 1 T , j m 2 T j 1, 2 n and e mT e m 2 T , and can be represented by a circuit shown in Fig. 16. Thus, the equation 27 forms in all n circuits to evaluate ik mT for k from 1 to n including delay elements. Output voltage Vo needed as the filter is given by multiplying the sum of closed circuit currents flowing through an output resister Ro and thusa digital filter shown in Fig. 17 is finally provided. It is obvious from Fig. 17 and the equation 29 that the matrix element ij at the same time, it., ij mT is not needed to obtain arbitrary ik mT . Namely, the filter can be constructed without producing DFL. Furtheremore, the above method to construct the digital filter can also be applied to a filter yielded by use of a circuit element having a dimension more than the square of s as an original analog filter and capable of being transformed to an LCR filter by impedance scaling. In addition, a digital filter without DFL can be realized in the same manner even with use of dther known s z transformation, e. g., s z 1 1 z 1 , s 1 z 1 and s z2 2 dz 1 Z2 1 , etc. instead of the s z transformation of the equation 24 . Subsequently, let us describe as an exemplification, a case wherein a fifth polarized low pass filter shown inFig. 18 is transformed to a digital filter based on the construction method for the digital filter described above. An analog transfer function HA s of the fifth polarized low pass filter of Fig. 18 cut off frequency 1MHz, allowable ripple contents of the pass band 0.28dB, attenuation pole frequencies 1.369345 MHz, 1.988127 MHz is given asEMI21.1 where A2 0.01991716490 A4 8.656982093 x 10 5 B1 0.4692808372 B2 0.1158863247 B3 0.02345920748 B4 2.200704185 x 10 3 B5 2.594782157 x 10 4 30 Effecting the bilinear s z transformation shown by the equation 24 for the analog transfer function HA s described above, frequency distortion is caused between analog and digital frequencies.A relation A tan D 31 2 2 is yielded between circular frequencies wA and respectively in the analog and digital regions from the equation 24 as shown in Fig. 19. To eliminate the influence of nonlinear distortion on the frequencies described above, the frequency axis of the analog filter is changed beforehand. Namely, parameters of elements of the analog filter are altered to shift the cut off frequency with use of the equation 31 so as to permit a desired cut off frequency of a digital filter to be obtained. In the above example, assuming the sampling period to be T 0.1 s , the cut off frequency of digital filter is D 1 MHz and the cut off frequency A of the analog filter must satisfy l A tan DT 1.03425152 MHz T from the equation 31 to provide the cut off frequency of the digital filter of fD 1 MHz. For that, capacitances and inductances of the circuit shown in Fig. 18 must be multiplied by D A, respectively. The circuit so obtained is shown in Fig. 20. Assuming closed circuit currents flowing through this circuit as shown in Fig. 20, a closed circuit equation is as follows EMI24.1 Subjecting the equation to the bilinear transformation and arranging the resultant equation to order in conformity with the procedure described previously,EMI25.1 is yielded where values of the coefficients are shown inFig. 21. The digital filter is thus constructed as shown inFig. 22 following three difference equations yielded from the equation 33 . In succession, logarithmic amplitude characteristric of the original fifth polarized low pass filter of Fig. 18 and that of the digiatl filter of Fig. 16 yielded as the result of the transformation will be evaluated respectively as shown below.a. Logarithmic Amplitude characteristic of the OriginalFifth Polarized Low Pass Filter. The transfer function HA s in the s region of the equation 30 is, after previously corrected in its frequency distortion produced due to the biliniar s z transformation as shown before, subjected to the bilinear s z transformation. For the resaltant transfer functionHD Z in the s region, z ejQ 34 is substituded and thereby the logarithmic amplitude characteristic can be evaluated with use of an expression 20log10 HD eJ d3 . Fig. 23 shows the evaluated logarithmic amplitude characteristic.b. Logarithmic Amplitude Characteristic of the DigitalFilter Shown in Fig. 22. Entering a unit sample series into an input of the digital filter of Fig. 22 to obtain impulse response and thereafter subjecting it fast Fourier transformation, the logrithmic amplitude characteristic can be yielded. Fig.24 shows a logarithmic amplitude characteristic when the filter coefficient of the digital filter is represented with use of binary floating point representation and only the fixed point part is rounded to a specified word length. For an internal operation format, a single accuracy real number format exponent 8 bits, fixed point part 24 bits is employed. It is formed from Figs. 23 and 24 that the amplitude characteristic of the second embodiment of the digital filter according to the present invention is very excellently coincident with that of the original analog filter. Then, let us describe coefficient sensitivity of the digital filter. A digital filter shown in Fig. 22 is yielded by applying the construction method in conformity with the second embodiment of the present invention to the fifth polarized low pass filter of Fig. 18 as described above.Changes of the logarithmic amplitude characteristic of the above digital filter with respect to the word length of the multiplication coefficient thereof are shown in Fig.25. A digital filter shown in Fig. 26 is exemprary transformation of the above fifth polarized low pass filter to a secondary cascade digital filter typical of a conventional one. The secondary cascade digital filter is constructed based on a transfer functionEMI27.1 derived by transforming the transfer function of the equation 30 to a transfer function in the z region in conformity with the bilinear transformation of the equation 24 , and furtheremore factorizing it to provide a product of quadratic expressions. Coefficient values are as shown in Fig. 26. Fig. 27 shows changes of the logarithmic amplitude characteristic of the above secondary cascade digital filter with respect to the word length of the multiplication coefficient thereof. it is understood by comparison of Fig. 25 with FJig.27 that the characteristic of the digital filter according to the construction method of the present invention is more ideal with respect to the same word lengths compared with the prior one, and thus the coefficient sensitivity can be reduced. Let us then describe the sensitivity of the digital filter to the internal operation word length thereof. Fig. 28 shows a relative error err of gains of the digital filter of Fig. 22 and the secondary cascade digital filter of Fig. 26 as the internal operation word lengths thereof are reduced. The relative error err is as follows.EMI28.1 where N the number of samples within the pass band GAo a gaing dB of the pass band of a reference filter not limited in coefficient word length and internal operation word length GA a gain dB of a filter to be compared. As is clearly shown in Fig. 28, the second embodiment of the digital filter according to the present invention can be constructed to be less sensitive to the internal operation word length as compared with that of the prior cascade digital filter. The digital filters being the first and the second embodiments of the present invention were adapted to be a digital filter comprising in combination the delay means, adder means, and multiplier means, by subjeting a mode equation or a closed circuit equation of an analog filter to s z transfotmation . The arrangement of this digital filter may also be constructed by, after transforming inductance of any analog filter with use of an equivalent circuit comprising resistors and capacitors each having positive and negative resistance and capacitance values, subjecting a node equation or a closed circuit equation on the equivalent circuit to s z transformation. This will be described below as a third embodiment. A digital filter being the third embodiment of the present invention is constructed by deriving a node equation for a circuit yielded by transforming inductance of an LC analog filter with use of the equivalent circuit comparising resitors and capacitors each having positive and negative resistance and capacitance values, and applying s z transformation being bilinear transformation to derive a difference equation. This equivalent transformation is achieved by transforming inductance L of an analog filter of Fig.29 a to resistance R and capacitance Lc of c of the same figure while transforming b of the same figure to d in the same manner. The node equation after this equivalent transformation can be represented in general as the following equation 41 . EMI30.1 Here, designated as E is input voltage to the filter, Vi i 1, 2, ..., n is node voltage, n is the number of nodes of the circuit, g is conductance, and G and C are respectibely n x n square matrices wherein each element of G is positive or negative conductance and each elemtaelement of C positive or negative capacitance.Then, bilinear transformation 2 1 z l 42 T l z is applied to the node equation of 1 . Here, designated as s is a complex variable of a transfer function HA s of the analog filter, z is a complex variable of a transfer function HD z of the digital filter, and T is a sampling interval. Substituting t2 for 41 , and putting the resultant expression in order,EMI30.2 is obtained.Here, putting E g0E 0...0 T , V V1 V2 ... Vn T 44 where T T denotes inversion of a matrix . , 43 becomesEMI31.1 Multiplying both sides of 45 byEMI31.2 the left,EMI31.3 is obtained. Here, I signifies a n x n unit matrix. Developing 46 and putting the resultant expression in order, an equation providing the mode voltage V and having proper delay, i. e., V A E l z l B z l V 47 can be obtained. Here, it becomesEMI31.4 Accordingly, a difference equation for the node voltageVk k 1, ..., n becomesEMI32.1 Here, k nT and e nT respectively signify inverse z transformation of Vk Vk z and E E z . Fig. 30 shows the arrangement of the digital filter of the third embodiment of the present invention in case of the number of nodes n 4, derived based on the equation 49 . An input E entered from an input terminal 31 at the time gT T a sampling interval, arbitrary integer is supplied to one of input terminals of an adder 33, while supplied to a delay element 34. The adder 33 adds the input signal and an output ER 1 from the delay element 34, and an output from the adder 33 is multiplied in a multiplier 35 m m 1, ..., 4 by ami and entered into one of five input terminals of an adder 36 m m 1, 4 .The other four inputs are as follows For example, an output from the adder 36 1 is delayed by one sampling interval T through a delay element 37 1 and multiplied by b11, b21, b31r and b41 in multipliers 38 11, 38 21, 38 31, and 38 41 respectively. Outputs from all multipliers are entered into the adders 36 1, 362, 36 3, and 36 4 respectively. The same operation is concurrently executed for outputs V2, V3, and V4 from the adders 36 2, 36 3, and 36 The other four inputs to each adder are yieled as described above. Outputs from the filter can be delivered from the output terminal 32. But, coefficients of each multiplier have previously been determined by the equation 48 .It is clearly shown from 49 or Fig. 30 that ú nT at the same time is not needed to obtain arbitray Uk nT . Namely, the digital filter can be assured without DFL. In addition, a closed circuit equation can be employed instead of the node equation of 41 . Namely,EMI33.1 or with transformation,EMI33.2 is obtained instead of the equation 41 . Here, R and D are respectively n x n square matrices, and each element of R is a reciprocal of positive or negative resistance, while that of D is a reciprocal of positive or negative capacitance. Accordingly, it is found that a digital filter without DFL can be constructed in the same manner as described above with use of the procedures described from the equation 42 on. It is furthermore obvious that a digital filter without DFL can be assured also when using another known s z transformation instead of the s z transformation given by the equation 42 . Then, let us show an exmaprary design for a concrete digital filter. Fig. 31 is a fifth polarized low pass filter. An analog transfer function HA s of this lowpass filter cut off frequency 1 MHz, allowable ripple conteents of the pass band 0.28 dB, and attenuation pole frequencies 1.369345 and 1.988127 MHz is given asEMI34.1 where A2 0.01991716489697047 A4 8.656982092718226 x 10 5 B1 0.4692808371624611 B2 0.1158863246587944 B3 0.0234592074798037 B4 2.200704184590143 x i0 3 B5 2.594782156707019 x 10 4 50 Although this analog filter will be transformed to a digital filter following the design procedures described before, frequency distortion is caused in that case between analog frequency and digital frequency upon effecting the bilinear transformation shown by the equation 42 . Namely, from 42 a relationEMI34.2 holds beteween circular frequency BA in the analog region and circular frequency xD in the digital region.Fig. 32 shows this relation. From the same figure, it is evidenced that circular frequencies D and A are in a nonlinear relation. To eliminate this, it is necessary to change previously the frequency axis of the analog filter.In fact, element parameters of the digital filter to be designed are altered so as to provide a desired cut off frequency of the digital filter with use of 51 . In the above example, with the sampling period T 0.1 sits analog cut off frequency fA must satisfyEMI35.1 from 51 to permit cut off frequency of the digital filter sD 1MHz to be yieled. For this, capacitance and inductance of the fifth polarized low pass filter shown in Fig. 31 are multiplied respectively byfD fA andfA fD Then, equivalent transformation of the inductance of Fig. 29 is conducted to obtain an equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 33.A node equation of this circuit becomes EMI36.1 Subjecting the above expression to bilinear transformation, and developing and putting in order the resultant expression following the procedure described before,EMI37.1 holds. Here, coefficients are as shown in Table 1. A difference equation isEMI37.2 from 53 . Fig. 34 shows a digital filter yielded on the basis of this difference e quation. Theoretical and experimental values of logarithmic amplitude characteristics of the digital filter so obtained are respectively provided as follows.

Thuys, a desited theoritical characteristics are yielded through 201og10 IH ejR IdB . Experimental Logarithmic Amplitude Characteristics Logarithmic amplitude characteristics are derived by entering a unit sample series into an input of a filter ofFig. 34 yieled according to the present construction method to provide an impulse responce thereof, and subjecting it to fast Fourier transformation. Thereupon, coefficient of the digital filter is represented with use of binary floating point representation, and only a fixed point part thereof is rounded into a designated word length. For an internal operation format, exponet 8 bits, fixed point part 24 bits of floating point representation is employed. Figs.. 35 and 36 show respectively theoritical logarithmic amplitude characteristics and experimental ones when the filter coefficient is 23 bits. Fig. 37 furthermore shows changes of the characteristics with respect to word lenghts of a multiplication coefficient. In succession, a typical cascade digital filter and a digital filter according to the present construction method will be compared. And, all digital filter according to the present construction method will be shown to be constructed with low coefficient sensitivity and reduced internal operation word lentgh. Fig. 38 shows a secondary cascade digital filter. The digital filter is consturcted based on a transfer functionEMI40.1 yieled by transforming the trasfer function of the equation 50 to a transfer function in the z region through the bilinear transformation of the equation 42 and furthermore factorizing the latter transfer function to obtain the product of quadratic equations. Fig. 39 shows changes of the logarithmic amplitude characteristics of the cascade digital filter of Fig. 38 due to the word lenghts of the multiplication coefficient thereof. Comparison between coefficient sensitivies of the cascade digital filter and the digital filter of the third embodiment of the present invention is shown by a relative error err ofEMI40.2 where N the number of samples in the pass band, GAo a gain dB of the pass band of a reference filter coefficient 23 bits, internal operation word length 24 bits GA a gain dB of a filter to be compared. Fig. 40 shows a result of the above description. It is found from the figure that the digital filter of the third emboidiment of the present invention is more reduced in the coefficient sensivity than that of the prior art cascade digital filter. Finally, table 2 shows ripple widths within the band and relative errors versus internal operation word lengths of the cascade digital filter and digital filter of the third embodiment of the present invention. It is evidenced from the figure that the digital filter of the third embodiment of the present invention is more reduced in sensitivity to the internal operation word length than that of the cascade digital filter.
