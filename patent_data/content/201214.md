## Description
This invention relates to polymeric microparticles having pesticidal activity. The polymeric microparticles may contain pesticidal agents such as virucides, bactericides, fungicides, antiseptics, preservatives, herbicides, algicides, insecticides, acaricides, nematocides, rodenticides, repellents, sterilants and the like. They may be used in lieu of conventional forms of such agents for protecting various industrial and other products, such as coating compositions, electric wire coverings, plastic products and the like, from being attacked by noxious animals and plants. It is well known that many industrial and other products are damaged by the growth of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. Other examples of noxious animals and plants include wood ingesting insects, aquatic animals and plants which foul ships and other marine constructions, such as acorn shells and algae. A number of agents are known and used in practice to control such noxious animals and plants. These agents are usually applied to an object to be protected as a solution or dispersion in a liquid binder, or as microcapsules incorporating an active substance in order to obtain a prolonged efficacy, although the active substance per se may be applied directly in certain cases. Such liquid preparations have certain disadvantages in that the release rate of the active substance is not constant and the length of the effective period is relatively short. Active substances are often not uniformly dispersed in the binder liquid or they may be susceptible to phase separation in storage. Microcapsules also have certain disadvantages in that they are incompatible with liquid carriers such as organic solvents or water which swell or otherwise rupture the capsule walls. It is generally difficult for microcapsules to control the release rate of the active substance in an optimum fashion. They are too large in size to form a thin film on a substrate. It is also known that certain disinfectants such as quarternary ammonium salts or iodine based antiseptics may be absorbed on a ion exchange resins for use as a long lasting preparation. The application of this technique is limited to only ionizable active substances and the resulting preparations are not suitable for forming a film on a substrate owing to their large particle sizes. US A 3400093 discloses an insecticide containing polymer latex produced by the steps of dissolving a water insoluble organic insecticide in one or more polymerizable vinyl type monomers and then emulsion polymerizing the insecticide containing monomers in an aqueous medium. However, the synthetic latex thus produced may only be formulated in water based surface coating compositions. The invention provides a method for producing pesticide loaded polymer microparticles having a diameter of 0.01 to 2 microns in which said pesticide is physically entrapped within a polymer matrix constituting said polymer microparticles, comprising polymerizing a mixture of ethylenically unsaturated monomers in a polymerization medium, said monomer mixture containing dissolved therein a pesticide which is soluble in said monomer mixture but insoluble in said polymerization medium, characterised in that said monomer mixture contains 1 to 99 by weight of the mixture of a monomer having at least two polymerizable sites per molecule or a combination of two monomers having mutually reactive groups whereby said polymer matrix is internally cross linked. Examples of pesticides include virucides, bactericides, fungicides, antiseptics, preservatives, herbicides, algicides, insecticides, acaricides, nematocides, rodenticides, repellents, sterilants and the like. The polymeric microparticle prepared by the method of this invention may find uses in controlling various noxious and destructive animals and plants as conventional pesticidal preparations, but exhibit significant advantages thereover. The polymeric particles may carry an active substance in a chemically stable manner and release it at an optimum concentration for a long period of time. The polymeric microparticles may be formulated in both aqueous and non aqueous formulations without adverse effects, and the resulting formulations may be applied even in cases where the active substances per se are not applicable for corrosion or other reasons. When the polymeric microparticles are incorporated in a pesticidal coating composition, they may impart not only the desired biological activity but also a structural viscosity to the composition. This improves the workability of the composition. Several methods are known for preparing polymeric microparticles. One method includes the steps of suspension or emulsion polymerizing a mixture of ethylenically unsaturated monomers in an aqueous medium, and removing water from the dispersion by means of solvent substitution, azeotropic distillation, centrifugation, drying and the like. Although any conventional emulsifier may be used, ampho ionic group containing surfactants, polymerizable monomers, oligomers and polymers are preferable. Ampho ionic group containing alkyd resins disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,322,324 and amphoteric amino sulfonate derivatives of epoxy resins disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,379,872 may advantageously be employed. Such method is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,530,946 assigned to the assignee of this application, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Another method commonly referred to as the non aqueous dispersion NAD method of precipitation polymerization method comprises polymerizing a mixture of ethylenically unsaturated monomers in a non aqueous organic liquid such as aliphatic hydrocarbons or solvents having high solubility parameters in which the monomer mixture is soluble but the polymer is insoluble. Conventional suspension or bulk polymerization methods may also be employed. The polymer microparticles used in the present invention may be prepared by any these known methods provided that they have an average particle size of 0.01 to 2 microns for retaining a good dispersibility, reactivity and stability. Examples of ethylenically unsaturated comonomers used for the production of microparticles include methyl meth acrylate, ethyl meth acrylate, n butyl meth acrylate, isobutyl meth acrylate, 2 ethylhexyl meth acrylate, styrene, α methylstyrene, vinyltoluene, t butylstyrene, ethylene, propylene, vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate, acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, dimethylaminoethyl meth acrylate and the like. Two or more comonomers may be combined. The starting monomer mixture contains from 1 to 99 by weight thereof of a monomer having at least two polymerizable sites per molecule or a combination of two monomers having mutually reactive groups to give microparticles which are internally cross linked. Cross linking comonomers include monomers having at least two ethylenically unsaturated bonds per molecule and the combination of two different monomers having mutually reactive groups. Monomers having at least two polymerization sites may typically be represented by esters of a polyhydric alcohol with an ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid, esters of an ethylenically unsaturated monoalcohol with a polycarboxylic acid and aromatic compounds having at least two vinyl substituents. Specific examples thereof include ethylene glycol diacrylate, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, triethylene glycol dimethacrylate, tetraethylene glycol dimethacrylate, 1,3 butylene glycol dimethacrylate, trimethylolpropane triacrylate, trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate, 1,4 butanediol diacrylate, neopentyl glycol diacrylate, 1,6 hexanediol diacrylate, pentaerythritol diacrylate, pentaerythritol triacrylate, pentaerythritol tetracrylate, pentaerythritol dimethacrylate, pentaerythritol trimethacrylate, pentaerythritol tetramethacrylate, glycerol diacrylate, glycerol allyloxy dimethacrylate, 1,1,1 tris hydroxymethyl ethane diacrylate, 1,1,1 tris hydroxymethyl ethane triacrylate, 1,1,1 tris hydroxymethyl ethane dimethacrylate, 1,1,1 tris hydroxymethyl ethane trimethacrylate, 1,1,1 tris hydroxymethyl propane diacrylate, 1,1,1 tris hydroxymethyl propane triacrylate, 1,1,1 tris hydroxymethyl propane dimethacrylate, 1,1,1 tris hydroxymethyl propane trimethacrylate, triallyl cyanurate, triallyl isocyanurate, triallyl trimellitate, diallyl phthalate, diallyl terephthalte and divinyl benzene. Combinations of two monomers having mutually reactive groups may be used in place of or in addition to monomers having two or more polymerization sites. For example, monomers having a glycidyl group such as glycidyl acrylate or methacrylate may be combined with carboxyl group containing monomers such as acrylic, methacrylic or crotonic acid. Other examples of the combination of mutually reactive groups include amine carbonyl, epoxide carboxylic acid anhydride, alkyleneimine carbonyl, amine carboxylic acid chloride, organo alkoxysilane carboxyl and hydroxyl isocyanate. Polymer microparticles prepared in an aqueous or non aqueous medium may be isolated by such conventional means as filtration, spray drying, lyophilization and the like, and used directly or after milling to a suitable particle size. Alternatively, the dispersion containing the particles may be subjected to solvent substitution and the resulting dispersion in a new medium may be used. The average size of polymer microparticles varies with the particular polymerization method. Thus, the emulsion polymerization and NAD methods are suitable for the range of 0.01 to 0.6 micron size, the precipitation polymerization method is suitable for the range of 0.2 to 2 micron size, and the suspension or bulk polymerization methods are suitable for the range of 1 to 2 microns size. The polymeric microparticles may be prepared by any of these known methods. The particle size distribution of polymer microparticles may be regulated by the selection of polymerization method or by suitably mixing particles having different average particles sizes. The specific density of polymer microparticles may be controlled by using an acrylic monomer containing halogen atoms or incorporating a nucleus forming substance to the monomer mixture. Bactericides and fungicides are used in a wide variety of products for industrial and household uses. Examples of such products include coating compositions, adhesives, starch products, plastics, cutting fluids, metal processing fluids, water based inks, casein, gellatin, textiles, fibers, thickening agents, leather, oils and fats, paper towels, sealants, electric wires, vinyl coated steel plates, wax emulsions, rubber latex, wallpaper and cloth, surfactants, shoe cream, paints, fire extinguishers, clays, glue and the like. For instance, plastic products such as films, moulded products, composite materials and packaging materials made of polyurethane, epoxy, acrylic or polyvinyl chloride resin may be contaminated, deformed or otherwise deteriorated by microorganisms. Water based coating compositions are becoming widely used in the paint industry substituting solvent typed compositions. They provide nutrient sources for microorganisms and thus the incidence of fungal fouling are increasing. Antiseptics are used in food processing, hygienic, medical and dairy fields. In the food processing field, regulations require the use antiseptics not only on machines, containers, worker s hands and other objects which are directly contacted by foods, but also on ceilings, walls, floors, clothes packaging materials and other environmental installations in order to prevent secondary contamination. As the number of applications expands, a variety of antiseptics are used because of the increase in species of contaminating mciroorganisms and antiseptic resistant strains. A number of antiseptics are known and commercially available for these purposes. Except certain antiseptics such as alcohols, aldehydes, gaseous antiseptics, inorganic chlorine compounds, iodine, hydrogen peroxide and other substances which are not suited to be carried by polymeric microparticles, any known fungicide, bactericide or antiseptic may be carried by polymeric microparticles in this invention. Examples thereof include thiazole compounds such as 2 thiocyanomethylthio benzothiazole phenols and halogenated phenols such as phenol, alkylphenol, bisphenol and p chloro m cresol quarternary ammonium compounds such as tetradecyl dimethyl benzylammonium chloride triazine compounds such as hexahydro 1,3,5 triethyl s triazine amphoteric surfactants such as alkyl bis aminoethyl glycine biguanide compounds such as chlorhexidine halogen compounds such as trichloroisocyanuric acid and chloramine T and organotin compounds such as tributyltin fluoride. Wood products and structures are susceptible to destruction by wood rotting fungi and termites. Various wood preservatives are used for preventing these problems. Examples thereof include CCA a mixture of copper, chromium and arsenic compounds , creosote oil, phenol derivatives dinitrophenol, dinitro o cresol, chloronitrophenol, PCP etc., , organotin compounds, organic nitrogen compounds, organic iodine compounds, copper hydroxyquinolinate, quarternary ammonium compounds, chlordane and the like. Repellents are often used alone or in combination with other wood preservatives. The polymeric microparticles of this invention may carry these wood preservatives. In the manufacture of cellulosic pulp and papers, slime controlling agents and anti fungal agents are used in the paper making step. Preservatives and anti fungal agents are incorporated to water based coating compositions containing binder materials such as casein, starch and latex. Preservatives and anti fungal agents used for these purposes are generally common to those used in other fields. Examples of slime controlling agents include chlorine compounds, chlorinated phenols, quarternary ammonium compounds, dithiocarbamate compounds, thiazole compounds, thiadiazine compounds, cyanate compounds, azide compounds, nitro compounds, halogenated acetamide compounds, organic bromine compounds, oximes and the like. Insecticides and repellents for domestic, agricultural and horticultural uses, phytopathogenic bactericides and fungicides, herbicides and rodenticides may also be carried by the polymeric particles of this invention. Examples thereof include phytopathogenic bactericides and fungicides such as azole compounds, 2,6 dimethyl N acrylanilides, benzamide derivatives and carbinol compounds insecticides such as synthetic pyrethroids, organic phosphate esters, N methylcarbamates, insect growth regulators IRG such as diflubenzuron, naturally accuring substances and their derivatives acaricides nematocides insect repellents pheromones and rodenticides such as zinc phosphide, coumarin derivatives, sodium monofluoroacetate, thallium compounds and diacin. Examples of herbicides which may be carried by the polymeric microparticles of this invention include phenoxy compounds, diphenyl ether compounds, carbamate compounds, carboxamide compounds, urea derivatives, triazine compounds, bipyridium compounds, dinitroaniline compounds, aliphatic acid derivatives, inorganic herbicides and mixtures of these substances. Recently phytocides found in many higher plants have become interesting for their pesticidal activity. They usually occur as complexes with alkaloids, glycoside, organic acid, resins or tannic acid. Such complexes may be used as such or they may be separated into individual components by extraction. The volatility of phytocides varies to large extent one to another. They exhibit varying pesticidal activities in terms of potency and spectrum. Among their selective activities of special interest are those against bacteria and other microorganisms, protozoa, insects, molluscs, aquatic animals, small land animals and plants. Terpenes such as monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and diterpenes are known insecticides. Monoterpenes found in essential oils such as lemon oil, citronella oil, rose oil, peppermint oil, menthol oil and thymol oil are known to have an anti microbial activity. Anti microbial activity of vegetable plants such as allium plants, e.g. garlic and onion, mustard, carrot, cabbage and radish is also well known. Anti microbial activities of phytocides have been already studied with respect to more than twenty thousand higher plants. These substances may be carried by polymeric microparticles singly or in combination with other substances. As an important application of this invention, the polymeric particles may carry various antifouling substances. Such preparations may be used for protecting ships, marine constructions, fish nets, fish cages and the like from being fouled with noxious aquatic animals and plants such as acorn shells and algae. Organic tin compounds have been widely used for this purpose as an antifouling agent. They may easily penetrate into cells and act on the mitochondria. Copper based antifouling agents are also of wide use. They gradually release copper ions to inhibit the respiration of fouling animals and plants. These antifouling agents may be carried by the polymeric microparticles in this invention. In order to prevent ships, fish nets and other marine structures from fouling, antifouling compositions containing heavy metals e.g. copper or tin or other toxic elements e.g. chlorine, phosphorus or arsenic have been widely used. However, the use of these toxic antifouling agents may cause pollution of rivers, lakes or oceans. They are also undesirable from the viewpoint of public health. Substituted coumalin derivatives as disclosed in Japanese Laid Open Patent Application No. 56 40601 such as methylumbelliferon, suberosin, osthole, desmethylsuberosin, 3,3 dimethylallyumbelliferon, cedrelopsin, cumularin or pimpinellin have been found to have no such adverse effects. This is because they do not contain any heavy metal or other toxic elements. Antifouling agents containing a lactone of the formula wherein R₁ and R₂ represent independently hydrogen or a C₁ ₈ saturated or unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon radical, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application No. 54 44018 may also be carried by the polymeric microparticles in the present invention. The active substance may be incorporated into the microparticles during the polymerization process by adding the active substance to the starting monomer mixture. This method is applicable to active substances which are soluble in the monomer mixture but insoluble in its polymerization medium. The following examples illustrate the invention.
