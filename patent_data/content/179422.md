# Trailer coupling.

## Abstract
An adjustable height trailer coupling for a vehicle such as an agricultural tractor in which a coupling 10 is mounted on a support member 11 which is vertically slidable relative to a support structure 13, 21, 23 for attachment to the rear of the vehicle. Two locking pins 14 are provided which are engageable with holes 16 in plates 13 to lock the support member 11 and coupling 10 in a given vertical position. The pins 14 can be slid in the fore and aft direction relative to the vehicle into and out of engagement with holes 16 by an op erating member in the form of a handle 17 which intercon nects two pivotted arms 18 to which the pins 14 are connected. Springs 20 act on the arms 18 to bias the pins 14 towards positions where they engage holes 16.

## Description
TRAILER COUPLINGTechnical FieldThis invention relates to trailer coupling installations on vehicles such as agricultural or industrial tractors and in particular to such installations which allow the height of the coupling to be adjusted.Various adjustable height trailer couplings have been proposed in the past, see for example German Patent 3 122 116 and German Patent application 2 910 164, but these constructions have either been of a relatively complex and thus expensive construction or have not been convenient to operate.Disclosure of the InventionIt is an object of the present invention to provide an improved form of adjustable height trailer coupling.Thus according to the present invention there is provided an adjustable height trailer coupling installation for a vehicle such as an agricultural tractor, the installation comprising a support structure for attachment to the vehicle, a coupling secured to a support member, said coupling and support member being vertically slidable relative to the support structure, and two sets of interengaging locking formations on the support member and support structure respectively, the two sets of locking formations being spaced transversely of each other relative to the vehicle, the installation being characterised in that the support member is provided with two locking formations each movable relative to the support structure in a fore and t direction relative to the vehicle between an engaged position in which it is engaged with a respective selected one of the locking formations on the support structure to lock the support member and coupling in a selected vertical position relative to the support structure and a disengaged position in which it is disengaged from the locking formation on the support structure and the support member and coupling are free to slide vertically, bias means to bias the movable locking formations on the support member towards their engaged positions, and an operating member interconnecting the two movable locking formations and allowing simultaneous movement of the movable formations to their disengaged positions against the action of the bias means to allow vertical adjustment of the support member and coupling relative to the support structure.As will be appreciated, the above trailer coupling installation is easy to operate since in order to adjust the vertical post ion of the support member it is simply necessary to move the operating member which simultaneously disengages both sets of inter engaging locking formations and allows the support member and coupling to be moved to another vertical position. Also, the coupling installation is of a relatively simple and thus inexpensive construction.In a preferred arrangement each movable locking formation comprises a locking pin which is slidable between its engaged and disengaged positions in a respective bore in the support member and is connected with one end portion of a respective pivotted arm, the other end portion each respective arm being pivotted on the support member, said one end portions of the arms being interconnected by the operating member in the form of a handle.Conveniently, bias means in the form of springs act between each arm and the support member to bias the arms towards the support member thus biasing the locking pins towards their engaged positions.Description of the DrawingsOne embodiment of the present invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of an adjustable height trailer coupling installation for use on an agricultural tractor with the towing hook removed for clarity Figure 2 is a side view of the upper part of the coupling installation Figure 3 is a rear view of the upper part of the installation with the towing hook omitted for clarity, andFigure 4 is a plan view of half of the installation.Best Mode of Carrying Out InventionThe trailer coupling installation basically comprises a coupling in the form of a towing hook 10 which is mounted on a support member in the form of a saddle member 11 which includes channels 12 which receive vertical support plates 13 which form part of a saddle support structure. The saddle member 11 is vertically slidable up and down the support plates 13 and can be locked in as number of different height positions using locking pins 14 which extend through holes 15 in the saddle member 11 and are also engageable in an appropriate hole 16 in the support plates 13 See Figure 2 . As best seen in Figures 2 and 3 each of the locking pins 14 is pivotally connected at 30 with one end portion of an arm 18 the other end of which is pivotally mounted at 19 on the saddle member 11. A spring 20 acts between each arm 18 and the saddle 11 to bias the arms towards the saddle and thus to bias each locking pin 14 towards its engaged position shewn in full lines in Figure 2.The arms 18 are interconnected by an operating member in the for of a handle 17. The handle 17 can be moved from the full line position shown in Figure 2 in which the locking pins 14 engage the appropriate hole 16 in the support plates 13 to the disengaged postion shown at 17 in Figure 2 in which the locking pins have disengaged the holes 16 as shown in 14 .As will be appreciated, in order to adjust the vertical height of the saddle 11 relative to the support plates 13 the pins 14 are disengaged from the holes 16 in support plate 13 by pulling the handle 17 in the direction of arrowX shown in Figures 1 and 2. This causes the arms 18 to pivot about their pivotal mounts 19 against the action of springs 20 thus withdrawing the pins 14 from the holes 16 and allowing the vertical height of the saddle member and thus the towing hook 10 to be adjusted.Once the pins 14 have disengaged the holes 16, and the saddle 11 has moved slightly so that the pins 14 are no longer aligned with a set of holes 16, the handle 17 can be released and will then automatically snap into the next available set of holes in the support plates 13 as the saddle member 11 is slid vertically. This is a particularly convenient feature of the installation of the present invention when making small adjustments in the vertical height of the towing hook since it is not necessary for the operator to maintain the handle 17 in its disengaged position 17 during the entire procedure. As indicated above the support plates 13 form part of a support structure which is bolted to the rear of the tractor. The precise details of the support structure employed depend on the constructional details of the tractor to which the installation is to be fitted. In the embodiment illustrated the support plates 13 are carried by side plates 21 which are connected by transversely extending plates 22 and 23 which also carry securing flanges 24 by which the side plates 21 are bolted to the rear of a tractor.As will be appreciated from the above, the present invention thus provides an adjustable height trailer coupling which is of a relatively simple and inexpensive construction which is also easy to operate.
