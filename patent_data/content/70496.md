# Apparatus for the treatment of flaky or granulated material with gases or vapors in a continuous countercurrent process.

## Abstract
The invention relates to apparatus for gentle thermal treatment of flaky or granulated material with vapors in continuous operation, wherein the vapors are introduced from the bottom 6 and conducted in counter current to the material falling downwardly by gravity and by the aid of additional mechanical means 5 through one treatment stage or a plurality of treatment stages, the individual treatment stages being defined by perforated plates 3 to which the material to be treated is fed by horizontal motion, the space below the lowermost, unheated perforated plate 4 serving to distribute the gases or vapors and to admit the latter uniformly to the entire treatment space, the bores of the openings or perforations in the plates having a cross section which allows the vapors, but not the material being treated, to pass therethrough, in order, on the one hand, to achieve optimum vapor exploitation and, on the other hand, to prevent any damage to the material being treated.
