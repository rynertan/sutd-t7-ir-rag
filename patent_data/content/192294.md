# Electron beam apparatus comprising a semiconductor electron emitter.

## Abstract
An electron beam apparatus comprising a semiconduc tor electron emitter whose emissive surface dimensions are determined by dimensions of a p n junction provided in the semiconductor element. By optimizing the dimensions of the emissive surface in relation to the electron optical properties of the apparatus, an emitter is realized which combines optimum beam formation or imaging with a sufficiently large beam current and a high beam current density as required by the apparatus.
