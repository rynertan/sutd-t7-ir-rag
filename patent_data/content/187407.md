# Processing vortex shedding frequency signals.

## Abstract
A circuit for processing a vortex shedding frequency signal of a vortex shedding flowmeter 10 comprises a phase detector 18 , a normally closed switch 24 and a low pass filter 26 connected in series. The phase detector 18 receives the vortex shedding frequency signal and applies it via the switch 24 to the low pass filter 26 , which produces an analog signal corresponding to the frequency of the vortex shedding frequency signal. A voltage controlled oscillator 20 is connected between an output of the low pass filter 26 and an input of the phase detector 18 for tracking the vortex shedding frequency and producing a tracking frequency signal which is maintained when the vortex shedding frequency signal disappears. A range or gain code circuit portion establishes a set time period during which the frequency signal is accumulated in a counter. The accumulated signal from the counter is utilised as a digital signal corresponding to the vortex shedding frequency signal.
