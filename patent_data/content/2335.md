# Semi hard magnetic material for a reed switch reed piece, process for producing the reed piece and use thereof.

## Abstract
Due to an Mo addition, to a known, Co Fe Nb semi hard magnetic material, the coercive force is enhanced without causing deterioration of the cold workability of the semi hard magnetic material. In addition, the energy product, the residual flux density and the fullness factor are high according to the semi hard magnetic material of the present invention. Such material is particularly suited for reed pieces of reed switches, which are mounted in a four wire crosspoint switch.
