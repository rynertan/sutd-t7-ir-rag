## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF MIXED ALCOHOLSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In view of a rise in price of gasoline for cars due to the aggravation of oil situation, an attempt to pro duce inexpensive car fuel by adding mixed alcohols to gasoline have been made in recent years. The reason why mixed alcohols are used as an alcohol component to be added to gasoline is that if methanol alone is added to gasoline, it combines together with water in gasoline to form a water methanol mixture, resulting in the formation of two layers, i.e., a gasoline layer and a water methanol mixed layer, in a storage tank. Various methods of producing such mixed alcohols have been proposed. Japanese Patent Application Laid OpenNo. 7727 1981, for example, discloses a process for producing mixed alcohols from synthesis gas by the use of a rhodium base catalyst. This process, however, is not preferred in that large amounts of by products such as acetic acid and aldehyde result. In addition, as catalysts for use in the production of mixed alcohols from synthesis gas, a ruthenium base catalyst Japanese PatentApplication Laid Open No. 82327 1982 , alkali metal modified ones of a zinc chromium catalyst and a copper zinc catalyst Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 10689 1982 , and a copper cobalt catalyst Japanese Patent ApplicationLaid Open No. 85530 1980 are known. Methods utilizing these catalysts, however, should be performed under elevated pressures.This will need expensive equipment and cause .many side reactions. Hence they cannot be said to be advantageous for practical use. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is intended to overcome the above described problems of conventional methods, and an object of the invention is to provide a process for producing mixed alcohols from synthesis gas with efficiency under relatively low pressures. One embodiment of the present invention relates to a process for producing a mixed alcohol comprising methanol and higher alcohols than methanol by contacting synthesis gas with a catalyst, wherein the catalyst is a solid substance prepared by calcining a mixture of A1 a copper compound, B1 a nickel compound, and C a compound of at least one metal selected from the metals belonging to Groups II,III and IV and the fourth period of Groups V, VI and VII of the Periodic Table impregnating the above calcined product with D an alkali metal compound and or an alkaline earth metal compound calcining the resulting mixture and reducing the thus calcined product. The other embodiment of the present invention relates to a process for producing a mixed alcohol comprising methanol and higher alcohols than methanol by contacting synthesis gas with a catalyst, wherein the catalyst is a solid substance prepared by calcining a mixture of A2 a zinc compound, B2 a compound of at least one metal selected from iron, cobalt, and nickel, and C a compound of at least one metal selected from the metals belonging to Groups II, ITI and IV and the fourth period of Groups V, VI and VII of thePeriodic Table impregnating the above calcined product with D an alkali metal compound and or an alkaline earth metal compound calcining the resulting mixture and reducing the thus calcined product.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION A method of preparing the catalyst of the invention will hereinafter be explained in detail. In the preparation of the catalyst Compounds A , B and C are first mixed and calcined. As Compound A , Compound A1 or Compound A2 can be used. As Compound A1 used herein, any suitable compound containing copper can be listed. Usually water soluble compounds are preferred. Suitable examples of copper compounds include copper nitrate, copper sulfate, and copper chloride. As Compound A2 used herein, any suitable compound containing zinc can be listed. Usually water soluble compounds are preferred. Suitable examples of zinc compounds include zinc nitrate, zinc sulfate, and zinc chloride. As Compound B , Compound B1 or Compound B2 can be used. Compound B1 used herein, any suitable compound containing nickel can be listed. Particularly preferred are water soluble compounds. Suitable examples of nickel compounds include nickel nitrate, nickel sulfate, and nickel chloride. Compound B2 is a compound containing at least one of iron, cobalt, and nickel. Particularly preferred are water soluble compounds. Suitable examples are the nitrates, sulfates, and chlorides of the metals. Compound A1 can be used in combination withCompound B1 . Similar by, Compound A2 can be used in combination with Compound B2 . Compound C is a compound of at least one metal selected from the metals belonging to Groups II, III andIV, and the fourth period of Groups V, VI and VII of thePeriodic Table. Typical examples of the metals belonging to Groups II, III and IV of the Periodic Table are magnesium, calcium, zinc, boron, aluminum, gallium, lanthanum, silicon, germanium, titanium, tin, and zirconium.Suitable examples of the metals belonging to the fourth period of Groups V, VI and VII of the Periodic Table are vanadium, chromium, and manganese. As Compound C , various compounds of the metals as described above, such as the titrates, sulfates, chlorides, and oxides thereof, can be used. Particularly preferred are water soluble compounds. As Compound C , salt of titanium is one of the preferable compounds. Especially sulfate of it is preferable. Other salts such as titanium tetrachloride are undesirable here. When dissolved into water, titanium tetrachloride, for instance, is difficult to treat since it fumes and is hydrolyzed not to be dispersed homogeneously. Moreover, other salts are insoluble in water. Titanium sulfate is a favourable salt for dispersing of titanium into catalyst as is described above, but sulfate radicals tend to remain in catalyst. When sulfur portion is 0.58 by weight or more, catalytic activity is scarcely observed. Accordingly, when titanium sulfate is employed for producing catalyst, it is inevitable to remove sulfate radicals to make sulfur portion less than 0.5 by weight after precipitate results. After earnest researches in removal of sulfate radicals, we have found that following two processes are desirable. One of the processes is to repeat washing with aqueous solution of sodium chloride after the precipitate results, and to exchange sulfate radicals with chlorine ions to reduce sulfate radicals, and thus make sulfur portion less than 0.5 by weight. Thereupon, the concentration of the aqueous solution of sodium chloride is desired to be 0.1 mole per liter 5 mole per liter. Another process is to adjust pH at co precipitating by addition of sodium carbonate. There, once co precipitation is made at pH 9.0 or more, after that the washing with plain water can reduce the sulfate radicals to make the sulfur portion less than 0.5 by weight. When pH is less than 9.0, activity does not arise sufficiently. In the preparation of the catalyst of the invention,Compounds A , B and C are first mixed and calcined. Compounds A , B and C can be mixed by techniques such as a co precipitation method, a kneading method, and a dipping method. In accordance with the co precipitation method, for example, they are added to water to form aqueous solutions or suspensions, which are then mixed and co precipitated by adjusting the pH through addition of a co precipitating agent such as sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, and potassium hydroxide at room temperature or at elevated temperatures. Then, the resulting precipitate is aged, if necessary, and washed with water, dried and calcined at a temperature of from 200 to 5000C. The above calcinated product is then impregnated with Compound D , i.e., an alkali metal compound and or an alkaline earth metal compound. Compound D is preferably water soluble. Suitable examples include sodium carbonate and magnesium acetate. In the impregnation of the calcined product, Compound D is used as an aqueous solution that is, the calcined product is impregnated with an aqueous solution of Compound D . After the process of impregnation, the resulting mixture should be calcined again. This calcination is usually performed at a temperature of from 100 to 5000C. Although the composition of the thus calcined product varies with the amounts of Compounds A , B , C and D being added, it is necessary for the molar ratio of A to B to C to D calculated as oxide to be controlled so that 0.05 A 0.7, 0.01 B 0.7, 0.01 C 0.7, and 0.005 D 0.3. The calcined product is then reduced. This reduction is sufficient to be performed at a temperature of from 200 to 4000C by the use of a reducing atmosphere, for example, in the presence of hydrogen or carbon monoxide. The thus prepared solid substance is used as the catalyst of the invention. Although Compounds A , B , C and D can be mixed and calcined simultaneously, Compound D of alkali or alkaline earth metal compound is dispersed only insufficiently and unevenly in the final product by such a procedure. Hence this procedure fails to produce the desired catalyst. In the process of the invention, the solid substance as prepared above is used as a catalyst, and synthesis gas, i.e., a mixed gas of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, is contacted with the catalyst to produce a mixed alcohol.The composition of the synthesis gas to be used as a feed in the process of the invention is not critical.In general, however, it is preferred to use synthesis gas in which the molar ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide is within the range of from 1 3 to 3 1. Other reaction conditions for the process of the invention are not critical and can be determined appropriately. The reaction temperature is usually from 200 to 5500C and preferably from 240 to 4500C the reaction pressure may be relatively low, in general, ranges between 20 and 200 kilograms per square centimeter by gauge and preferably between 40 and 100 kilograms per square centimeter by gauge and the gas hourly space velocity GHSV is from 500 to 100,000 per hour and preferably from 1,000 to 50,000 per hour. The process of the invention as described above produces mixed alcohols comprising methanol and higher alcohols than methanol, such as ethanol, propanol, and butanol, and other compounds such as aldehydes and esters.The selectivity of the mixed alcohol is high in the process of the invention. This is one of the advantages of the present invention. Another advantage is that the costs of equipment and operation, for example, can be greatly reduced, since the reaction pressure in the process of the invention is sufficient to be relatively low. Furthermore the proportion of alcohols other than methanol in the mixed alcohol as produced by the process of the invention is relatively high, and thus the mixed alcohol is suitable for use as an alcohol component to be compounded to gasoline. The present invention is described in greater detail with reference to the following examples.EXAMPLE 1 An aqueous solution Aqueous Solution I 2.5 liters containing 48.3 grams of copper nitrate 3 hydrate , 29.1 grams of nickel nitrate 6 hydrate , and 59.5 grams of zinc nitrate 6 hydrate was prepared and heated to 600C.
