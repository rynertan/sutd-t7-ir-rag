# Depository apparatus for banking documents.

## Abstract
A depository apparatus, for use in an automatic banking sys tem or the like, comprises a housing 2 including a deposit aperture 4 , a storage chamber 8 and ducting means for conducting banking deposits 26 from the deposit aperture to the storage chamber. The storage chamber 8 comprises a receiving zone 12 , a storage zone 10 adjacent to the receiv ing zone, and gate means 22, 24 mounted between the receiving zone and the storage zone to permit one way pas sage of deposits from the receiving zone to the storage zone. The ducting means comprises a duct member 6 mov able between a normal position and a deposit position. When the duct member is in the normal position a first end of the duct member communicates with the receiving zone so that a deposit 26 in the duct member automatically passes into the receiving zone 12 and a second end of said duct member is closed. When the duct member is in the deposit position the second end communicates with the deposit aperture 4 so that a deposit can be inserted through the aperture 4 into the duct member 6 and the first end is closed. A pusher member 28 operates in response to movement of the duct member 6 from the normal position into the deposit position to push a deposit 26 from the receiving zone 12 through the gate means into the storage zone 10 .
