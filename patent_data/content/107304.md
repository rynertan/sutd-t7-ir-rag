# SMALL COMPUTER

## Abstract
A small computer includes a base processor and a number of peripheral devices. The base processor is con nected to the peripherals via a bus along which signals in a high level language e.g. a message block format, are com municated. Each peripheral device has an interface to the bus including a memory store enabling the high level mes sages to be translated into machine codes to control the de vice. An additional processor may be included, and it is treated, in effect, as a further peripheral device with an in terface to the bus.
