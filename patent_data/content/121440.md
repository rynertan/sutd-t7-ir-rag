# Process for the interesterification of a triglyceride oil.

## Abstract
The process is a discontinuous process wherein the oil is subjected to interesterification in a discrete charge and com prises bringing together streams comprising respectively at least a portion of a charge of triglyceride oil and a catalyst solution of water, alkali metal, hydroxide and glycerol, homogenising the mixture, reducing its water content, and interesterifying. The process can be performed either as a semi continuous process or as a circulatory batch process. Preferably the homogenisation and drying steps are com bined and are performed by passage through a spray drying nozzle. The spray drying nozzle preferably sprays the mixture directly into the reaction vessel.
