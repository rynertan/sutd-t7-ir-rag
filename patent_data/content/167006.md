## Description
The unprecedented growth of the chemical industry since World War II has led to somewhat over 35 million metric tons of mostly toxic waste being generated. Large quantities of synthetic halogenated materials such as dielictric fluids, flame retardants, refrigerants, heat transfer fluids, lubricants, protective coatings, pesticides, including herbicides and insecticides, and many other chemicals and petroleum products useful in agriculture, industry and health care have been manufactured and used to the benefit of mankind. In many cases, these materials and their by products or residues from their manufacture have been released into the ecosphere and have been accumulated in landfills, the atmosphere, lakes, rivers and streams, as runoff or direct discharge. Many of the halogenated chemicals employed in these applications in agriculture and industry are toxic and accumulate in animal and plant tissues causing serious comfort or health problems. Many also persist in the environment because they are not biodegradable because of the inability of natural microflora generally available in the environment to degrade them. Many methods and techniques have been proposed and used for disposing of and or treating these chemicals, their by products, and their wastes in a way which makes them compatible with the environment. In spite of all the effort and money being spent to clean up the ecosphere, the problem persists. Disposing of waste chemicals accumulated from past practices and preventing future accumulation of such noxious materials is of worldwide concern. The continuing manufacture of such chemicals, which have proven to be essential and so important and necessary to agriculture, industry, and health care in the betterment of mankind continues, and so does the piling up of the obnoxious wastes which are non biodegradable or not disposable into the natural carbon cycle. US P 4 274 954 relates to a process for degrading and removing anionic and or non ionic surface active agents, detergents and the like from wastewater containing the same comprising treating wastewater containing the anionic and or non ionic surface active agents, detergents and like compounds with a novel microbial strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens under aerobic conditions and the novel microorganism of the strain Pseudomonas fluorescens. Over the past few decades especially in the last ten years, hundreds of millions of dollars and many years of effort have been spent in trying to clean up the ecosphere. There have been many academic disclosures which describe bacteria which grow on aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic and polynuclear aromatic compounds. For example, a variety of microorganisms have been isolated that have the capability of efficiently utilizing aromatic organic chemicals as sole carbon sources for growth e.g. toluenes, phenols,and naphthalene .See Clarke, P.H. and Ornston, L.N. 1975 Metabolic Pathways and Regulations , Notwithstanding all the effort, as represented by the scientific publications in this area of technology, there has been no practical application of these technologies in cleaning up the ecosphere. Furthermore, it has been suggested that because halogenated compounds are not generally found in nature, microorganisms have not evolved which possess efficient enzyme systems or genes which express themselves for the degradation of such chemicals see Chatterjee, D.K., Kellogg, S.T., Furukawa, K., Kilbane, J.J., Chakrabarty, A.M., Genetic Approaches to the Problems of Toxic Chemical Pollution , Third Cleveland Symposium on Macromolecules, 1981. Chakrabarty disclosed a technique for artificially inducing the biodegradability of 2,4,5 trichlorophenyl acetic acid 2,4,5 T by gradually exposing bacteria to increased concentrations of the chemical over the course of about one year see Chatterjee, D.K., Kellog, S.T., Eatkins, D.R. and Chakrabarty, A.M. in Levy, S., Clowes, R. and Koenig, E. Eds. , Molecular Biology, Pathogenicity and Ecology of Bacterial Plasmids , Plenum Publishing Corp., N.Y., 1981, pp. 519 528. Contrary to these teachings, and much to our surprise, we have found that microorganisms present in the locus of concentrated deposits of halo organic chemicals have not only managed to stay alive but have adapted themselves to grow and multiply on the halo organic e.g., chlorinated hydrocarbons in the landfill as their sole source of carbon and energy. Although we do not wish to be confined to any theory as to why this phenomena exists, we offer the following possibilities, provided they are not construed as limiting our invention and discoveries, except as expressly contained in the appended claims. Prior to chemical wastes being accumulated in a given landfill the soil and surrounding environment was populated with bacteria that used the normal hydrocarbon material in the soil as their source of carbon and energy. As the obnoxious chlorinated organics and other wastes were deposited on them, all but the strongest were killed off. Per Charles Darwin s theory of survival of the fittest including the process of evolution which includes isolation, speciation, mutation and other processes and mechanisms, conjugation into other bacteria whether of the same strain, species, genera or different involved in the process of natural selection certain of these bacteria adapted their metabolisms to break the carbon chlorine bond causing the formation of more easily metabolized materials, e.g. catechols or further metabolized derivative compounds, haloaliphatic compounds, which are more in line with the substrates the bacteria have been accustomed to metabolizing. Another possibility is that the bacteria in the soil always possessed genes in their DNA which were capable of metabolizing chlorinated organics. These genes may have been active and expressed in the ancestors of the organisms when salt and chlorine may have been more concentrated and abundant in their sites. But in recent times, the bacteria never had to use them, i.e., such genes were not expressed because there were easier metabolized carbon material on their sites for them to thrive on. This theory supports the fact that the low concentrations of chlorinated organics in the ecosphere due to pesticide applications are not concentrated enough to cause the bacteria to adapt to metabolizing them, thus, the persistance of these chemicals in the soil and ecosphere and their nonbiodegradability. No matter what the theory, we have found that bacteria capable of biodegrading a waste are created at the locus of the waste when there is a significant concentration of the waste to the exclusion of other sources of carbon for the bacteria to feed on and when enough time has elapsed thereby allowing for the mutations in the bacteria which allow for their biodegradation to be continuously expressed from one generation to the next. This invention relates to a process for microbial degradation of chlorinated organic chemicals by use of Pseudomonas cepacia var., niagarous, selected from the group consisting of According to this invention it is possible to dissimilate chemicals such as halogenated organic compounds back into the natural carbon cycle. The chlorinated aromatic compounds are converted into carbon dioxide, water and salt. The process for microbial degradation of obnoxious organic wastes into innocuous materials can comprise the following steps Samples of soil and leachate were recently obtained from a landfill site of the Hooker Chemical and Plastics Corp. in Niagara Falls New York which had been used for disposal of chlorinated organic wastes during the period 1955 to 1975. These samples were utilized in enrichment experiments and were found to contain microorganisms that were able to dissimilate 2 chlorotoluene, 3 chlorotoluene, 2,6 dichlorotoluene, 3,4 dichlorotoluene, 2,4 dichlorobenzoate and 3,4 dichlorobenzoate as sole carbon and energy sources for growth. The identity of the bacteria that degrade the chloroaromatic compounds was established as Pseudomonas species and are specifically designated respectively as follows HCI 2CT , HCIV 3CT , HCV 2,6 DCT 2, HCV 3,4 DCT 5, HCV 2,4 DCB , HCV 3,4 DCB , HCV 2,6 DCT 3, HCV 3,4 DCT 7, HCV 2,6 DCT . HCV 2,6 DCT 2, and HCV 2,6 DCT 3 have been further identified as The processes of sampling, enrichment, isolation, separation, purification and application employed will be given in the examples which follow.

The following examples are given to further describe our invention however,, they are given for illustrative purposes only and are not included to limit the scope of our invention except as defined in the appended claims. Soil samples were collected during the month of May from portions of a landfill site at a depth of about above 8 to 12 inches to the top of the soil in Niagara Falls, NY at a place where there was a high concentration of contaminants and where the odor of halogenated chemicals in the soil was self evident. The landfill has been used for obnoxious organic wastes including chlorinated organics for a period of over 20 years. Approximately 1 gram of soil was suspended in 25 ml of minimal salts media of the following composition contained per liter 40 ml of Na₂HPO₄ KH₂PO₄ buffer pH 6.8 20 ml of Hutner s vitamin free mineral base and 1.0 g of NH₄ ₂ SO₄. The medium contained 0.2 of L Tryptophan and 0.05 of Difco Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Michigan yeast extract, according to the prior art Lichstein, H.C. and Oginsky, E.L. in Experimental Microbial Physiology, W.H. Freeman Company 1965 . The enrichment culture was statically incubated in shallow culture for 72 hours at 25 C. After incubation, 0.1 ml of the enrichment broth was spread over the surface of solid minimal salts media with a bent glass rod and the plates incubated at 25 C. The solid media also contained 0.2 of a specific haloaromatic carbon source. Several serial isolations were carried out by removing colonies with a wire loop and streaking over the surface of fresh solid media containing a specific haloaromatic carbon source. In this way purified isolates were obtained. After primary isolation and purification utilizing one substrate as the carbon source, the microorganisms were then tested on solid media for growth on other chlorotoluenes and chlorobenzoate compounds as shown in Table II and III. Cells from ATCC 31943 which contain plasmids pRO 4.7, pRO 31, and pRO 54 were grown on the surface of nutrient agar plates overnight at 23 C. The cell crops were removed from the nutrient agar plates washed and resuspended at high density in buffered 25 sucrose pH 8.0 as described by Hanson and Olsen, J. Bacteriology, Figure 1 shows a typical Agarose slab gel electrophoresis which is explained in a later part of the disclosure. A portion 25 ml of TN broth tryptone, yeast extract, glycose and salt was inoculated with cells from a nutrient agar plate grown overnight and incubated at 37 C in a shaker until the optical density 425 µm was 1.0. The mixture was centrifuged cold at 10 rpm for 18 minutes and the cells separated from the supernatant and resuspended in 10 ml of 0.15 M MgCl₂ and allowed to stand for 5 minutes in ice. The mixture was centrifuged again and resuspended as above and held on ice for 20 minutes. The mixture was centrifuged and resuspended as above a third time and 0.2 ml of the resuspended cells added to prepared DNA 10 50 µl in a cold centrifuge tube and held on ice for 60 minutes. Heat pulse was applied for 2 minutes at 37 C and then chilled. Finally, 0.5 ml TN broth at room temperature was added and the mixture staticly incubated 1 2.5 hours at 37 C. This recipient strain, PAO 2178, see Royle, P.L., Matsumoto, H. and Holloway, B.W., J. Bacteriol., Conjugal mating experiments were done using PAO 2178 as the recipient bacterial strain. Strain PAO 2178 was a mutant of PAOl All matings were done in TN broth medium. For this, TN broth medium was inoculated with overnight growth from TN agar. These broth cultures were incubated for 3 hours with agitation at 37 C. Inoculation was adjusted to result in approximately 10⁸ cells per ml of TN broth culture after 3 hours of growth. Donor and recipient cells were mixed 1 1 and incubated at 37 C for 2 hours Mating mixtures were centrifuged at ambient temperature, and cell pellets were suspended to 1 10 the original volume of 0.01 M phosphate buffer pH 7.0 . Cell suspensions were diluted and plated onto mineral salts medium supplemented with the nutrients is specified by the recipient and a haloaromatic compound whose utilization required by the doner plasmid. Plates were incubated for 48 hours at 23 C. Transconjugants were purified by picking colonies into liquid suspension, followed by streaking out for single colony isolation on solid medium identical to that used for their primary isolation. The transconjugants obtained were able to metabolize all of the chlorotoluene and chlorobenzoate compounds examined, as was the case for the genetic donor in these conjugation experiments, HCV 2,6 DCT 2. In addition, they also utilized 3 and 4 chlorobenzoate, compounds not utilized by the doner. The substrate utilization profile for these transconjugants, designated PAO 2178 2,6 DCT 2 3 and 4 is shown in Table V. Plasmid DNA was extracted from HCV 2,6 DCT 2 and a transformant and a transconjugant derived from HCV 2,6 DCT 2, as described earlier. These DNA preparations were purified in cesium chloride ethidium bromide gradients and subjected to slab agarose gel electrophoresis. In Figure 1, file A, plasmid DNA from the parental strain, HCV 2,6 DCT 2, is shown and it contained plasmids of 4.7, 31 and 54 Mdaltons In molecular size plasmid size was determined previously using appropriate standards . File 8 contains the recipient strain PAO 2178. The results in File B demonstrates that the recipient strain does not harbor resident plasmids. File C, shows plasmid DNA extracted from a transformant, strain PAO 2178 2,6 DCT 2 1. File D, shows plasmid DNA from a transconjugant strain PAO 2178 2,6 DCT 2 3. As shown in files C and D, the plasmid band from either the transformant or transconjugant is approximately 63 Mdaltons in molecular size. The molecular sizes of plasmids from either transconjugant or transformant strains were similar but larger than those observed in the donor strain HCV 2,6 dCT 2. This result was unexpected since two different genetic techniques were utilized to transfer the plasmids to the recipient, PAO 2178. The explanation for this is the occasional random formation of a fusion plasmid in the donor bacterial culture, which contains the 4.7 and 54 Mdalton plasmids present usually independently in a donor bacterium. These fusion plasmids have been uniquely selected in the genetic transfer experiments because one of the donor plasmids contains a replicator functional in strain PAO 2178 and the other donor plasmid component contains a nonfunctional replicator but has the genes which encode for the degradative activities. Therefore, maintenance of the degradative activity, in this strain, requires the maintenance of the replicator contained in the 4.7 Mdalton plasmid. To approximately a kilo of each three clean soils are added 1 gram of 3,4 dichlorobenzoate, 3 chlorobenzoate and 2,6 dichlorotoluene to produce soil samples contaminated to 1000 ppm. Fifty ml of liquid media culture containing HCV 2,6 DCT 2 and HCV 3,4 DCB are added to the soil and the mixture incubated at 25 C. Five gram samples of soil are taken daily and analyzed for the substrate. Five grams of soil are weighed into a 50 ml erlenmeyer flask containing 10 ml of distilled water. The pH of the soil suspension is adjusted to 4.0 with dilute H₂SO₄ and extracted with 3 10 ml portions of methylene chloride. The methylene chloride extracts are transferred to a 50 ml volumetric and made up to volume. The methylene chloride solution is analyzed a 254 µm using a Beckman Lamda 3 UV VlS spectrometer. Monitoring the utilization of the chloroaromatic substrates shows that 90 of the chloroaromatic substrates are decomposed within 1 week. In order that the scope and breadth of the process of our invention for biodegrading the contaminants in the ecosphere back into the natural carbon cycle may be more readily understood, the following additional disclosures are made in connection with it. A sample of contaminated air is obtained in a standard air bag or filter sampling device. The airborne bacteria in the sample which have adapted themselves to metabolize the organic contaminants in the contaminated air back into the natural carbon cycle are enriched, isolated, purified, identified, and produced substantially in accordance with the procedures given in Example No. 1 on HCV 2,6 DCT 2 . In this case, the bacteria are applied to the contaminated air in a closed system by known techniques. By periodic monitoring of samples from the locus of the contaminated air, one will find that there will be a reduction in the density of the contaminants. Leachate from chemical waste landfill drainage is placed in a 500 gallon glass lined pressure reactor, agitated and heated to a temperature of about 30 C. To this reactor is added 2000 parts per million of each of the Pseudomonas strains isolated as in Example I. After 38 hours, the pressure in the reactor will increase up to about 2 atmospheres. The pressure is released through a valve in the reactor. The vented gases are analyzed and found to be mainly carbon dioxide. The remaining contents in the reactor are analyzed and are found to be carbonated saltwater. The concentrations of the noxious toxic chemicals are reduced.
