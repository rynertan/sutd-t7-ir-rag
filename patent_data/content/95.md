# Outerwear.

## Abstract
An outerwear coat or jacket is provided with a removable liner whereby the liner has fastener means spaced from the edges of the liner adapted to engage mating fastener means on the edges of the outer shell so as to leave marginal panels projecting from the front edge of the outer shell to effectively increase the overall girth of the outerwear when the liner is fitted to the outer shell such that the internal girth is the same when the outer shell is worn with the liner as when the outer shell is worn independently.
