# Polyester polyether copolymer composition.

## Abstract
The invention comprises a polyester polyether copoly mer composition which comprises a polyester polyether copolymer composed mainly of an aromatic dicarboxylic acid, 1,4 butanediol, and polyalkylene glycol of average molecular weight from about 400 to 6,000, an effective amount of organotin compound, and an amide containing phenolic antioxidant. The antioxidant which is used has at least one group of the formula The glycol component of the polyester component comprises glycols of molecular weight less than 250 with at least 70 mol percent of 1,4 butanediol. The polyalkylene glycol component preferably consists mainly of tetra methylene glycol units.
