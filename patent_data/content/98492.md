# Method for the production of railway rails by accelerated cooling in line with the production rolling mill.

## Abstract
Railroad rails having improved wear resistance, are produced by controlled forced cooling from above the aus tenite transformation temperature, to produce rails having a fine pearlite metallurgical structure in the head portions 6 of the rails. Apparatus comprising a series of cooling headers 1a, 1b utilizing a liquid cooling medium, such as unheated i.e. cold, or ambient temperature water, alternat ing with a series of air zones 2a, 2b , is preferably arranged in line with the production rolling mill, to receive hot rails as they emerge from the mill, without the necessity of inter vening reheating. A roller type restraint system 9 trans ports the rails through the cooling apparatus, while restrain ing them in the appropriate position. Each segment of the rail length is intermittently subjected to forced cooling by spray application of the liquid cooling medium, applied to the head portion 6 and the central portion of the base bottom 7 of the rail, with means being provided to prevent spray from impinging on the web and base tips of the rail During the intervals between applications of forced cooling, heat soaks back from the web portion 4 of the rail, the operating parameters of the system being so arranged that the temperature of the rail remains essentially above the martensite formation temperature. A computerized control system discontinues the application of forced cooling, at a predetermined stop temperature, also above the martensite formation temperature. The apparatus and method are cap able of producing rails having the desired fine pearlite structure in the head portion, on a consistent basis, notwith standing wide variations in temperature between different rails, and different segments of the same rail, as they emerge from a conventional production rolling mill.
