# Blends of polyetherimides and organopolysiloxane polycarbonate block copolymers.

## Abstract
Disclosed are blends of a a polyetherimide and b an organopolysiloxane polycarbonate block copolymer. Such blends exhibit a good combination impact strength and flex ural properties particularly at relatively high proportions of polyetherimide, and elastomeric behavior at relative high concentrations of the block copolymer of organopolysilox ane and polycarbonate.
