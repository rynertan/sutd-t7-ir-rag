# Apparatus for the automatic shearing of a sheet metal in several pieces of different size.

## Abstract
The apparatus includes a shear provided with a shear ing blade, feeding means for feeding a sheet metal to the shear and at least one movable carrier arranged down stream of the shearing blade. The movable carrier is con trolled in such a way as to receive and store the sheared pieces and then to return them to the feeding means or, selectively, to cause the sheared pieces to reach collecting means for their sending to discharge. A manipulator with a rectilinear motion perpendicular to the shearing blade and a rotator, which are located upstream of the shearing blade, preferably constitute the sheet metal feeding means and provide for receiving, rotat ing and feeding the metal sheets to be sheared, as well as for receiving, rotating and feeding again to the shear the sheared pieces returned by the movable carrier.
