## Description
Acrylic terpolymers, process for the manufacture thereof and of hair fixing formulations for use as air pump or aerosol sprays.Objects of the present invention are the process for the manufacture of terpolymers of acrylic acid, ethyl acrylate and t butylacrylamide, the terpolymers as obtained by this process, a process for the manufacture of a hair fixing formulation containing the terpolymers, the hair fixing formulation as obtained by the process and its use as airpump or aerosol sprays.Acrylic polymers are known in the art, e.g. in US Patent 3,112,296, to be useful as hair spray resins, viz. as polymers which are suitable for use as hair fixing formulations in e.g. air pump sprays or aerosol cans. Among the particularly useful acrylic polymers is the terpolymer acrylic acid AA ethyl acrylate EA t butylacrylamide tBAM .In Example 1 of US Patent 3,112,296, for instance, the terpolymerAA EA tBAM is commonly made by copolymerizing ethyl acrylate and t butylacrylamide and then partially saponifying the ethyl acrylate moieties in the polymer chain to give acrylic acid moieties. This method is now recognized as giving a terpolymer having less than the ideal balance of water solubility and curl retention properties of the final resin, probably due to an unevan distribution of carboxylate groups down the polymer chain.A second method of manufacture of a terpolymer, having AA EA units therein, is the terpolymerization of acrylic acid, ethyl acrylate and a third acrylic monomer. But by methods known to the art as e.g.described in US Patent 3,927,199 for acrylic acid, methyl acrylate and various acrylic monomers as third monomers, these terpolymerizations are not wholly satisfactory in giving a hair spray resin having balanced water solubility and hair curl retention properties.Reproducibility from batch to batch of terpolymerization runs also are a problem. Finally, this method as well as the copolymer saponification method result in a broad range of polymer chain lengths in the final terpolymer resin, together with appreciable amounts of unreacted monomers that contribute undesirable odors and toxicity to the final product.It is highly desirable that a hair spray resin be water soluble for easy removal from the hair by shampooing. This need for water solubility must be balanced against a certain degree of hydrophobicity needed for curl retention. As can be appreciated, curl retention is adversely affected by humidity and high moisture content of the hair.In a humid atmosphere, the moisture content of the hair is generally enhanced by hydrophilic resins on the hair and decreased by hydrophobic resins on the hair.It has now been found that a particularly desirable balance of water solubility and curl retention properties can be achieved by an AA EAtBAM terpolymer which hays the carboxylate groups evenly and uniformly distributed along the polymer chain.It is also desirable in a hair spray resin of this type to have an average molecular weight of about 15000 to about 60000, with a very narrow distribution of polymer chain lengths within this range.It is an object of this invention to provide an AA EA tBAM terpolymer of the above indicated kind for use as a hair spray resin, which the advantageous properties as described above having in contrast to polymers manufacturated by known methods substantially no unreacted monomer present in the terpolymer and that particularly shows solution clarity in water and alcohol, and is above all reproducibly manufacturable under defined conditions.The objects of this invention are realized according to the present invention by a new process for the manufacture of a polymer of acrylic acid, ethyl acrylate and t butylacrylamide which is characterized in that the polymerization process comprises the steps of a preparing an ethanol solution of a monomer mixture of about 6 to about 8 percent by weight of acrylic acid, about 37 to about 45 percent by weight of ethyl acrylate and about 46 to about 56 per cent by weight of t butylacrylamide b introducing in a first portion a minor amount, preferably 5 to 15, in particular about 10 percent of the total weight of the monomer mixture solution as prepared in step a into a reaction vessel containing ref fluxing ethanol and then c without further heating, continuously and substantially simultane ously adding the remainder, viz. the second portion of the monomer mixture solution and an ethanol solution of a free radical gener ating polymerization initiator to the reaction vessel over a period of about 1 to about 3 hours at a rate that maintains reflux of the reaction mixture by the heat of the polymerization reaction, pro vided that the addition of the monomer mixture solution is complet ed about 15 to about 30 minutes before the addition of the ini tiator solution is completed.The monomer mixture as prepared in step a of the inventive process preferably contains about 7 percent by weight of acid, about 41 percent by weight of ethyl acrylate and about 51 percent by weight of t butyl acrylamide. The monomer mixture solution optionally contains a minor effective amount, e.g. about 0,001 to about 0.05 percent by weight, of a polymerization inhibitor as is commonly provided in commercial samples of acrylic monomers. Such polymerization inhibitors are well known in the art, and are generally hydrÏquinone or hydroquinone derivatives, particularly the monomethyl ether of hydroquinone.In a preferred embodiment, the ethanol solution of the monomer mixture also contains water, so that the ethanol used in step a in the monomer mixture solution contains about 30 to about 40, n particular about 35 percent by weight of water, the water being supplied by the water content of the monomer and or by direct addition of water. It is preferred that all of the water is supplied by the water content of the monomer, in particular of t BAM, which thus is used in this particular embodiment as an aqueous paste. An amount of ethanol and water is generally applied in order to obtain a mixture containing preferably about 35 to about 45, in particular about 40 percent by weight of total monomers.Any free radical polymerization initiator which is commonly used in the polymerization art comes generally into consideration as initiator for use in step c of the inventive process. Organic peroxide initiators are however preferred. It is crucial to the performance of the inventive terpolymerization process that the polymerization initiator be added in step c to the reaction mixture in solution, preferably in alcohol solution.Non peroxide initiator, e.g. 2,2 azobis 2,4 dimethylvaleronitrile can be used successfully in alcohol solution, but not as successfully as the preferred peroxide initiator. As the artisan will appreciate the rate of addition of the monomer mixture solution can be adjusted to accommodate different activities of different polymerization initiators. Suitable peroxy initiators appear to be those having a half life of about one hour at a temperature in the range of about 70 120 C. Commercially available alcohol soluble, organic peroxide polymerization initiators include t butylperbenzoate, t butylperoxyneodecanoate, 2 ,5 dimethyl 2,5 bis 2 ethylhexanoylperoxy hexane, O,O t butyl O isopropylmonoperoxy carbonate, and t butylperoctoate.Of these, t butylperoctoate is preferred.A further crucial feature of the inventive process for the manufacture of the terpolymer is the sequence and time of addition of the monomer mixture solution and of the initiator solution as indicated above in step c since early polymerization in step a leads to a polymer of excessively high molecular weight and vapor phase polymerization of the refluxate in step c leads to resins that are cloudy in water and show poor washability, due to the formation of a predominantly ethyl acrylate polymer. Both of these undesirable effects are avoided by the method as described in the inventive process. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the inventive process, the initiator solution is added over a period of about 2.0 to about 2.5 hours and the monomer mixture solution is added over a period of about 1.5 to about 2.0 hours in step c .Increasing the initiator addition time or decreasing the monomer addition time, increases the molecular weight.The weight ratio of the initiator to the total monomers can vary in a relative wide range. It is however preferred that the weight ratio in process step c of total monomers to polymerization initiator is about 100 1 to about 125 1.It is advantageous to carry out step a under an atmospere of an inert gas which contains about 2.5 to about 10 percent by volume of oxygen, preferably about 6 percent per volume, and steps b and c under an inert gas atmosphere. In both cases, the inert gas is preferably nitrogen. The terpolymers as obtained by the inventive process for their manufacture are characterized by their molecular weight of about 15000 to about 60000 and their narrow range of polymer chain length distribution as stated above, that is a dispersity up to 2.5.Dispersity is the ratio of the weight average and number average molecular weights, and is a measure of the molecular weight distribution the greater the dispersity, the broader the distribution range also see Die Synthese von einheitlichen Polymeren byJ.H. Winter, Springer Verlag Berlin Heidelberg New York 1967, page 29 .Molecular weights and dispersities can be determined by gel permeation chromatography GPC according to known methods. See e.g. Bulletin Calibration of GPC Systems published April, 1974, by Waters Associates, Inc., Maple Street, Milford, Massachusetts 01757, 1Gel Permeation Chromatography, A new Method for Molecular Weight Distribution of High Polymers by J.C. Moore in J. of Polymer Sciences,Part A, Vol. 2, p. 835 to 843 1964 and Application of Gel Permeation Chromatography to High and Low Molecular Weight Polymers , byL.F. Maley in J. of Polymer Sciences, Part C, Vol. 8, p. 253 to 268 1965 .Preferred terpolymers have molecular weights of about 25000 to about 35000, most preferably about 30000 and a dispersity not greater than about 1.5 to about 2.5, preferably not greater than about 2.0.Such terpolymers can be incorporated in hair fixing formulations by methods which themselves are well known in the art. The process for the manufacture of hair fixing composition for this purpose is characterized in that the carboxylic groups of the polymer in ethanol solution as inventively obtained are neutralized by titration with a base, particularly with potassium hydroxide, preferably an aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide of a preferred strength of 40 percent by weight and the polymer in ethanolic solution as neutralized in this way is then further diluted with ethanol to a polymer content of about 0.2 to about 10, preferably about 2.5 percent by weight.Optional additives may be incorporated into the hair fixing formulations of this invention in order to modify certain properties thereof.Among these additives may be included plasticizers such as glycols, phthalate esters and glycerine, silicones, emollients, lubricants and penetrants such as lanolin compounds, protein hydrolyzates and other protein derivatives, ethylene oxide adducts and polyoxyethylene cholesterol, U.V. absorbers, dyes and other colorants and perfumes. Total amount of these ingredients does not exceed about 10 percent by weight of the weight of the terpolymer used in the formulation. The resins of this invention show little or no tendency to chemically interact with such additives.The hair fixing formulations as obtained by the above described process for their manufacture are characterized in that they contain about 0.2 to about 10 percent by weight of the neutralized polymer and optionally usual hair cosmetic additives as above described, the formulation being preferably an ethanol solution.Such hair fixing formulations are suitable for use as air pump sprays or as sprays charged to butan propane propellent aerosol cans. When charged in such pump sprays and aerosol cans and used as a hair spray, the inventive hair fixing formulations exhibit all of the characteristics required of such a product. Their films are transparent, glossy, flexible and strong. They possess good antistatic properties, adhere well to hair, are easily removed by soapy water or shampoos, allow the hair to be readily recombed, do not yellow on aging, do not become tacky when exposed to high humidities and have excellent curl retention even under high humidity conditions. Standard hair spray formulations and use evaluation methods are set out in New Concepts in Hair Products by Mel Hoyt in Cosmetics andPerfumery, Vol. 88, p. 53 to 55 1973 .The above described invention is further set out below in the following examples, wherein all parts and percents are by weight unless otherwise specified Example 1 A solution is prepared and stored, having 76 parts of acrylic acid, 422 parts of ethyl acrylate and 528 parts of t butylacrylamide dissolved in 528 parts of water and 1001 parts of ethanol.The water is derived from using 1056 parts of a 50 paste of t butylacrylamide. The EA and AA monomers, being commercial samples, contain polymerization inhibiting amounts of the monomethylether of hydroquinone, generally about 0.01 to about 0.02 percent by weight. The solution is prepared and stored under a nitrogen atmosphere, containing about 6 percent by volume of oxygen.A second solution is prepared, having 8.9 parts of t butylperoctoate dissolved in 77 parts of ethanol. About 10 of the first solution is charged to a reaction vessel, equipped with a reflux condenser and a gate agitator, under a nitrogen atmosphere. At the time of the charge, the reaction vessel contains 144 parts of ref fluxing ethanol. External heating is discontinued while separate streams of the second solution and the remaining 90 of the first solution are introduced into the reaction vessel at a rate to maintain reflux, over a period of about 1.5 to about 2.5 hours. The addition of all of the first monomer mixture solution is completed about 15 minutes to about 1 2 hour before completion of the second initiator solution. The initiator solution is added over a period of about 2.0 to 2.5 hours and the monomer mix turesolution over a period of about 1.5 to 2.0 hours. Agitation under nitrogen atmosphere is continued, after completion of the addition of the last of the initiator solution, until the reaction is complete, about 2 hours.Finally solvent is distilled off under a nitrogen stream till a concentration of about 50 percent solids is reached.The terpolymer of this Example can be used as the alcohol solution, or all or part of the alcohol can be removed by distillation.The terpolymer of this Example has a weight average molecular weight of about 30000 with a dispersity of about 2.0.Examples 2 and 3 Repeated runs of Example 1 are made in Examples 2 and 3.Characteristics of Polymers of Examples 1 to 3The terpolymers of Examples 1 to 3 show the following characteristics Properties Example 1 Example 2 Example 3Average molecular weight 30,026 27,328 27,107Dispersity 1.98 1.85 1.85Unreacted monomer p.p.m. N.D.

The comparison of the characteristics of the terpolymers of Example 1 to 3 shows that a dispersity of about 2, that is 1.5 to 2.5 and an average molecular weight of about 25000 to about 35000 are thus readily achieved.Example 4 The alcohol solution of the resin obtained in Example 1 is titrated to neutrality with 40 aqueous potassium hydroxide and further diluted with ethanol to give a solid content of 2.5 . The resulting dilute, neutral solution of the polymer is charged as a hair fixing formulation to an air pump spray or to a butane propanepropellant aerosol can for use as a hair spray, whereby the good properties of the hair fixing formulations as described above are performed.
