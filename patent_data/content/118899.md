# IMPROVED ANIMAL PET MEDICAL COLLAR

## Abstract
An improved animal pet medical collar is provided which comprises a solid resilient foam body having a doughnut shape formed by a peripheral, generally annular wall defining a central opening adapted to fit around the neck of an animal pet. The wall is wide enough to prevent the pet wearing it from mouthing a part of its body and thus injuring itself by pulling stitches, licking wounds, etc. The body wall has a pair of spaced opposite ends bridged by a drawstring anchored to one of the ends and passing through the other end to the outside of the body, against which it is releasably locked by a spring clamp or the like. The clamp can be a pair of spring biased tubes with alignable transverse, drawstring receiving openings. The drawstring can include a spring or be formed of stretchable material. The drawstring can also include an alarm actuable by excess drawstring tension. The collar can further include recessed drawstring detents in a concealed compartment and a cover which bridges the body gap. The collar is simple, inexpensive, durable and efficient.
