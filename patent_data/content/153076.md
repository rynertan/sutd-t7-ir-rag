# Gerotor motor and improved lubrication flow circuit therefor.

## Abstract
A rotary fluid pressure device is disclosed of the type in cluding a roller gerotor 17 having a ring member 23 and a plurality of rollers 25 serving as internal teeth. At each end of each roller 25 is a side clearance space 85 and a small amount of lubrication fluid flows from each pressurized volume chamber through the side clearance spaces 85 into an adja cent lubricant recess 81 . All of the lubricant recesses 81 are in communication with the fluid collecting groove 79 and lubrication fluid flows from the groove 79 to the motor lubri cation flow path. The lubrication flow path includes flow through a rearward bearing set 35 a forward bearing set 33 a pair of fluid passages 36 the forward spines 37, 39 and the rearward splines 43, 45 . The invention results in im proved lubrication generally, and of the forward splines in par ticular. The invention also improves the load holding capability of the motor and biases the valve drive shaft 49 to its rear ward position ro reduce wear of the internal spline 53 of the rotary valve member 55 .
