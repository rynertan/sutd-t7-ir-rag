# Method and apparatus for separating paper and fibres from portions of polyethylene film material.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus are disclosed for separating paper fibres from portions of polyethylene film. Paper laminated with polyethylene film is used in packaging, particularly for milk and cream. The resultant scrap material has not been hitherto successfully separated into paper and polyethylene, and the contamination of polyethylene with paper renders such material useless for recycling. In the use of the disclosed apparatus, the polyethylene film contaminated with paper fibres is subjected to treatment that converts the paper fibres into substantially uniform balls which are separated by gravity by being entrained in a stream of air with the polyethylene film pieces and impacted against a plurality of impact surfaces and the relatively light polyethylene film being separated from the relatively heavier damp paper fibres by means of a cascade of separators relying upon gravity separation of the heavier component. Provision is made to remove the damp paper fibre balls and recover the polyethylene film from the apparatus. The apparatus disclosed consists of a shredder 10 for receiving and shredding batches of damp, paper fibre contaminated polyethylene film portions, a blower 15 arranged to receive the material from the shredder 10 which consists of small pieces of polyethylene film and balled paper fibre, and blow it into a first fluffer 17 containing a plurality of impact surfaces 19 to 27 to effect further separation, a first plurality of separators 29 in cascade arranged to separate the paper fibre balls from the polyethyline film by differential air entrainment and gravity separation through screens 32 , the balls falling through into collection chambers 33 , a further fluffer 37 and a further plurality of separators 39 in cascade, leading to a drier 41 and, possibly, an extruder 42 for the separated and collected polyethylene film portions.
