# Method of controlled cooling for steel strip.

## Abstract
In controlledly canine steel strip, the heat transfer rate needed for attaining the desired cooking rate is calculated from an equation including strip thickness, the cooling start ing and finishing temperatures, and the desired cooling rate. The flow rate of coolant is determined and set by using an equation expressing the predetermined relationship be tween the heat transfer rate and coolant flow rate. The length of the coolant spraying region extending in the direc tion of strip travel is calculated from the running speed of the strip, the cooling starting and finishing temperatures, and the desired cooling rate. The nozzles are set to turn on and off so that the coolant is sprayed from such a number of nozzles as correspond to the length of the spraying region thus calculated. Based on these settings, the coolant flow rate is corrected by re calculating the heat transfer rate when strip thickness varies in the course of controlled cool ing. Also, the on off pattern of the nozzles is corrected by re calculating the length of the coolant spraying region when the running speed of the strip varies.
