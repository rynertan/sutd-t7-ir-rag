# Method and apparatus for continuously quenching a steel plate.

## Abstract
A method of and apparatus for continuously quenching a steel plate 12 with cooling water, by passing the steel plate through a water storage vessel 10 containing the cooling water. The cooling water for cooling the upper side of the steel plate is introduced into the upper section of the water storage vessel from an upper portion of the latter and is exhausted from an upper portion of the same through, for example, overflow. The cooling water for cooling the lower side of the steel plate is introduced into the lower section of the water storage vessel from a lower portion of the latter and exhausted from a lower portion of the same. The cooling water is agitated and moved by impellers 32, 34 disposed in the upper and lower sections of the storage vessel in the direction of movement of the steel plate or in the direction opposite to the direction of movement of the steel plate which is clamped and fed linearly through the water storage vessel by means of upper and lower rolls 16, 18 . The water for cooling the upper side of the steel plate is circulated only through the upper section of the water storage vessel while the water for cooling the lower side of the steel plate is circulated only through the lower section of the water storage vessel.
