# Gas separation apparatus.

## Abstract
Apparatus for separating one gas from a mixture of gases wherein a cylindrical shell 11 having openings 13, 38 for admitting and discharging a mixture of gases surrounds a bundle of hollow fiber membranes 16 which extend through a tube sheet 17 mounted in one end of the cylindrical shell. A resilient sheet in the form of a slit tube 41 surrounds the bundle of fibers and is attached at one end thereof to the tube sheet. The remainder of the slit tube is free of restraint such that it is expanded into contact with the inner surface of the shell. In a preferred embodiment, the slit tube is secured to a tubular distribution element 32 having one end thereof positioned inside the slit tube and the other end thereof secured to the tube sheet, the distribution element being provided with ports 34 for allowing the gas mixture to enter the bundle of fibers. The slit tube protects the fibers against damage during handling.
