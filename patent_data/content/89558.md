# Filter connector with discrete particle dielectric.

## Abstract
A filter connector incorporates a capacitor formed in the connector with dielectric material consisting of discrete particles maintained in electrical contact with the live and ground electrodes. Since the dielectric material is handled in non rigid bulk form, no breakage is encountered during assembly and handling. Disassembly of the connector for repair is feasible. Both method and apparatus are described.
