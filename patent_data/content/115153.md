# INTAKE MANIFOLD FOR AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE

## Abstract
The invention relates to an induction manifold for a dry manifold internal combustion engine which comprises a rigid plenum chamber 10, intake pipes 14 extending from the plenum chamber 10 to the individual engine cylinders, and extensions 16 of the individual intake pipes 14 disposed within the plenum chamber 10. To achieve broad band tuning without the need for movable parts, each extension 16 within the plenum chamber 10 is formed with at least one aperture 2.
