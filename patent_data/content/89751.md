# Filter for solid particulates.

## Abstract
A solid particulate filter 20 of honeycomb construction is formed with a matrix of thin, interconnected walls 22 which define a multiplicity of cells 28,29 . The thin walls 22 have interconnected open porosity of a volume and size sufficient to enable the fluid to flow completely across the thin walls 22 in their narrow dimensions between adjoining cells and through the thin walls in their longer dimensions between adjoining or neighbouring cells and to restrict the particulates in the fluid from flowing either completely across or through any of the thin walls. The cells are divided into an inlet group 28 and and outlet group 29 . The inlet group of cells 28 has a substantially greater collective thin wall surface area than the outlet group of cells 29 .
