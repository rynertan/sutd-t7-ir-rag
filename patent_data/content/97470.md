# A device for removing irregularities in or enlarging an underground duct.

## Abstract
A device for removing irregularities in or enlarging a buried duct comprises a cylindrial housing 10 correspond ingly approximately in diameter to the required diameter of the duct, a plurality of tapered leaf members 14 pivotally attached at their rear ends to the front of the housing 10 , and a conical wedge 18 driven by an axial hydraulic ram 12 mounted inside the housing 10 . In operation, the apparatus is drawn through the duct with the leaf members 14 in a retracted position in which they form a tapered nose portion, until an irregularity in the duct causes resistance to forward movement. The ram 12 is operated to force the leaf members 14 outwardly against the wall of the duct to remove the irregularity. The leaf members 14 are then retracted as the apparatus is drawn forward to the next obstruction.
