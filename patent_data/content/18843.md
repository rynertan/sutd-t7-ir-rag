# Semiconductor memory device with parallel output gating.

## Abstract
A semiconductor memory device, comprising N memory cell arrays 11,12,13,14 each of which includes a plurality of memory cells, is arranged to enable the use of the said semi conductor memory device in either the one bit per word sequential output form, through a single output gate 5 , or the N bits per word, parallel output form, through N output gates 31,32,33,34 .
