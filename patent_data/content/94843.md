# Radiation image recording and read out method and apparatus.

## Abstract
In a radiation image recording and read out system in which a radiation image is recorded on a recording member 2 comprising a stimulable phosphor layer, the recording member is then scanned with a laser beam, and light emitted from the recording material is photoelectrically read out to reproduce a visible image, a gas ion laser beam source 7 generating a laser beam having a wavelength shorter than 600 nm is used to provide the laser beam. The recording member 2 is fixed on a supporting material 1 , circulated and reused to record radiation images thereon. The appar atus comprises a mechanism for circulating the recording member with respect to the image read out section by repeatedly moving the supporting material and the image read out section with respect to each other, and an erasing apparatus 11 for eliminating the radiation energy remain ing in the recording member after the read out step. The supporting material is an endless belt, a rotatable drum or a plate, and the recording member comprises a continuous phosphor layer or a phosphor sheet.
