# Ceramic rotor.

## Abstract
A ceramic rotor comprises integrally formed blade portions 2 made of ceramic material sintered at atmospher ic pressure and a blade holding portion 1 also made of ceramic material sintered at atmospheric pressure and having a larger density than that of the blade portions, the blade portions being cemented to the blade holding portion by ceramic material. The thickness d₁ of the blade holding portion is not less than the thickness d₂ of the blade portions but is less than the distance d₃ between the front and rear surfaces 8,3 of the blade portions. In the manufac ture of the ceramic rotor the blade portions and the blade holding portion are separately formed and coupled by applying ceramic material therebetween, and the coupled bodies are sintered at atmospheric pressure to produce the ceramic rotor.
