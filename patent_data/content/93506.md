# Preparation of a frozen food product for later use.

## Abstract
A mixture of food pieces are first cooked. After the free water has been removed from the precooked food, leaving voids in the food mass, the food mass is agitated and the surfaces of the food pieces are treated so as to be partially frozen to thereby a hold the basic shape of each piece without major deformation during agitation, and b leave a small amount of unfrozen moisture on the surface of each piece. Dry powdered uncooked adjuvant is then added to the food mass and, during further agitation, comes in contact with the partially frozen surface of each piece and is caused to adhere thereto by the attraction of the remaining mois ture, causing a uniform coating of adjuvant to be applied to the food pieces. The resulting product is then fully frozen for deep freeze storage in a large container. Due to the uniform distribution of adjuvant throughout the food mass, subse quent reconstituting of any part thereof, or all of it at once, by the addition of free water and heat, will result in edible dishes which have the same basic proportions of ingre dients. The food mass and the subsequently added adjuvant may be agitated by tumbling in a drum into which is introduced expanding COâ‚‚ gas to provide the freezing function. The gas may be used to assist the introduction of adjuvant into the drum from an adjuvant storage hopper having a distributor at its lower end.
