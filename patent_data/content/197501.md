# EXTENDED DRAIN CONCEPT FOR REDUCED HOT ELECTRON EFFECT

## Abstract
Hot electron injection into the gate oxides of MOSFET devices imposes limitations on the miniaturization of such devices in VLSI circuits. A buried channel is provided to guard against hot electron trapping effects while preserving process and structure compatibility with micron or submic ron VLSI devices. The channel current is redirected into a buried channel at a distance away from the interface in the vicinity of the drain region where the hot electron effect is most likely to occur. This redirection is effected by providing a buried, lightly doped region extending inwardly from the conventional source and drain implant profile regions.
