# Reagent handling.

## Abstract
A sealed reagent container structure that contains reagent material, has a body portion with length and width dimensions each greater than its height demension and port defining neck structure upstanding from the upper wall of the body portion and asymmetrically located so that it is close to one endwall of the body portion. Coupling structure on the bottom wall of the body portion is provided for interengagement with a transport mechanism so that a series of reagent containers may be disposed on the transport mechanism for movement past a reagent station where the reagent material is transferred from the reagent container to the analysis cuvettes for mixing with sample material and analysis.
