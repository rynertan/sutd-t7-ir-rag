## Description
FLAME RETARDANT POLYMER SYSTEMS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND PRIOR ART The present invention relates to flame retardant resin systems and, more particularly, to flame retardant polymer compositions which contain as a polymer portion the reaction product of a hexahalocyclopentadiene, a polyhydric alcohol, a polycarboxylic acid containing aliphatic carbon to carbon unsaturation a styrene type monomer, and maleic acid anhydride. The flame retardant properties of such polymers are substantially increased by utilizing a brominated organic compound and minor amounts of finely divided antimony oxide or zinc borate. The present polymer systems are useful in the preparation of articles of commerce which may be cast, molded or laminated. The standards for flame retardancy for such articles have increased steadily over the years in increasing increments. Many polymer compositions previously considered to be flame retardant and useful in industry do not meet the standards of today or the improved standards which are almost certain to be set in the future. Thus, flame retardant resin compositions developed at this point in time must not only meet today s standards, but must meet higher standards to be viable in the marketplace.In addition to improved flame retardant standards, other properties, such as strength and transparency, are continuously improving, and a product, to be comn0ercially competitive, must be as good as, or better than, the flame retardant polyiaer compositions available today. The present flame retardant systems and polymers fulfill these criteria. One method of increasing the flame retardancy of a polymer system is to add a material with known flame retardant properties to the syster,l. However, many additives adversely affect physical properties, such as transparency or strength, and, in addition, have a detrimental effect in the gel and curing conditions. Thus, improving the flame retardancy using additives has not been eminently successful. The present invention relates to polyester polymer systems, that is, polymerizable mixtures of components, and also to polymerized compositions of such systems in their finally reacted form as insoluble, infusible copositions. Polyester systems and compositions containing adducts of hexahalocyclopentadiene are well known in the art and are described in U. S.Patents laos. 2,779,700 and 2,779,701, the teachings of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Briefly, the hexahalocyclopentadiene component may be a chloro, bromo or fluoro substituted cyclopentadiene wherein all of the hydrogens are replaced by a halogen. Hexachlorocyclopentadiene is presently the most economic and readily available hexachlorocyclopentadiene and, hence, is preferred in the present invention. The hexahalocyclopentadiene component is utilized in the form of an adduct which is capable of being esterified with a polyhydric alcohol or a polycarboxylic acid. Most preferably, the adduct is the reaction product of hexachlorocyclopentadiene and maleic acid or anhydride to product l,4,5,6,7,7 hexachloro bicyclo 2.2.1 5 heptene 2,3 dicarboxylic acid or anhydride.Such compounds are sometimes referred to as chlorendic acid or anhydride and may be so referred to hereinafter in the present specification. The polymer compositions of the present invention may be prepared by conventional mass or solution polymerization techniques. Polyester systems containing brominated additives to improve flame retardancy are also known in the art, for example, U. S. Patents Nos. 3,480,600 3,755,498 3,763,644 4,032,509 and 4,051,311. However, brominated additives have not been eminently successfully used in polyester resin systems or compositions because of their adverse effect on leathering, light stability, strength and heat distortion properties of the final resin product, particularly polyester resin products such as panels used in the construction industry. The present resin systems and compositions contain a reactive adduct of hexachlorocyclopentadiene with a compatible brominated additive and do not suffer the adverse effects frequently attributed to the addition of brominated coipounds. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The flame retardant polymer or polymerized compositions of the present invention contain the reaction product, an adduct of hexahalocyclopentadiene with maleic acid or anhydride, a polyhydric alcohol component, a polycarboxylic acid or acjd anhydride coiponent containing aliphatic carbon to carbon unsaturation, a maleic or halomaleic, and a styrene type component. The flame retardancy of the systems and resultant polymerized compositions is substantially bolstered by the inclusion of finely divided antimony oxide, zinc borate, or mixtures thereof and a brominated organic compound soluble in styrene. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION AND PREFERRED EMBODIMENlS The various components of the present polyester polymer systems and compositions are described separately below. The reactive adducts of hexahalocyclopentadiene useful in the present invention, particularly the maleic acid or anhydride adducts, have been described in the foregoing. The preferred adducts are 1,4,5,6,7,7 hexa chlorobicyclo 2.2.1 5 heptene 2,3 dicarboxylic acid or anhydride. The adducts are generally present in the polyester in amounts between about 40 and about 65 percent by weight. The polyhydric alcohol component can be aliphatic or alicyclic and can have aliphatic carbon to carbon unsaturation, and may have up to 40 carbon atoms. Preferably, the alcohol component contains between about 2 and about 12 carbon atoms. Examples of suitable alcohols are ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, propylene glycol, and includes reactive ethers, such as allyl glyceryl ether, or mixtures of alcohols or alcohols and ethers. The alcohol component is generally present in the polyester in amounts between about 10 and about 30 percent by weight. The polycarboxylic acid component includes acid anhydrides and may be aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic providing there is at least some aliphatic carbon to carbon unsaturation. The acid component niay have up to 40 carbon atoms. Preferably, the acid component contains between about 3 and about 12 carbon atoms. Examples of suitabl e polycarboxylic acids are maleic, fumaric, itaconic, sebacic or mixtures thereof. The acid component is generally present in the polyester in amounts between about 10 and about 60 percent by weight. The maleic or fumeric acid or anhydride component is utilized to render the polyester copolymerizable and, if not added as part of the polycarboxylic acid component, is suitably added separately. Generally, the maleic acid component is present in amounts between about 1 0 and about 40 percent by weight of the polyester. The brominated organic materials must be soluble in styrene and stable to heat and light. Typical bromine containing compounds useful in this invention include dibromoneopentyl acrylate, tribromoneopentyl acrylate, tribromophenyl acrylate, tribromophenyl methacrylate, dibromophenyl methacrylate, tribromoneopentyl methacrylate, octabromodiphenylene oxide and decabromodiphenylene oxide. Preferred compounds are selected from dibromoneopentyl glycol, dibromoneopentyl glycol fumarate, pentabromoethyl benzene, dibromopropyl acrylate, tris 2,3dibromopropyl phosphate, or mixtures thereof. Generally, such materials are present in the system in amounts between about 2 and about 2 5percent by weight and, more preferably, from about 5 to about 15 percent by weight, of the system. Usually, less than about 2 percent does not significantly improve the flame retardancy of the final polymerized composition, and amounts greater than about 2 5 percent by weight do not produce a polymerized product having the structural strength and heat distortion properties required or desired in r.iany applications, particularly in the production of laminated panels used for construction purposes. The finely divided metallic component is selected from antimony oxide or zinc borate, or mixtures thereof, preferably in a colloidal size. Generally, such component is present in amounts between about 0.5 and 5.0 percent and, more preferably, between about 1.0 and about 3.0 percent by weight of the system. Less than about 0.5 percent by weight usually does not significantly improve the flame retardancy of the final polymerized compound and do not synergistically improve the flame retardancy imparted by the added brominated organic material.In amounts over about 5.0 percent by weight the metallic component does not produce a final product which exhibits physical strength and the clarity properties desired for use in the construction industry.Amounts within the range of from about 1.0 and about 3.0 percent by weight enhance the flame retardant properties contributed by the brominated organic material in a synergistic manner. The styrene type component is a monomer and suitably includes styrene, alpha methylstyrene and halogenated styrenes, such as o , p and mchlorostyrenes. The styrene type component is generally included in amounts between about 25 and about 40 percent and, more preferably, between about 30 and about 35 percent, by weight of the total polyester system. The following examples are presented to illustrate the invention and are not to be interpreted as limiting the invention to the specific embodiments of the examples. Unless otherwise indicated, all parts in the examples are parts by weight, and all temperatures are in degreesCentigrade.EXAMPLE I Fifty two and eight tenths parts of ethylene glycol and ninety party of diethylene glycol were charged into an esterification vessel and blanketed with an inert atmosphere of nitrogen. With agitation the mixture was heated to a temperature between about 800 and 1000. 394.7 parts of .1 ,4,5,6,7,7 hexachlorobicyclo 2.2.l 5 heptene 2,3 dicarboxylic anhydride was then blended with the glycols. Seventy and eight tenths parts of maleic anhydride was then added with continuous mixing and the temperature raised to 1600 to 1700. Water of esterification was removed and the acid number monitored. When an acid number of about 55 was reached, 3.6 parts of tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol was added.Upon reaching an acid number of about 45, the mixture was allowed to cool and cast into pans under an inert atmosphere. The product was a faintly colored transparent brittle material melting at a temperature above room temperature and below 100 C EXAMPLE II One hundred parts of the cast product of Example I was crushed and added, with agitation, to 30 parts of styrene containing 0.03 parts of hydroquinone and the mixture maintained under an inert atmosphere.A complete dissolving took a period of about 24 hours. The resultant product was a clear, substantially colorless solution having a viscosity of about 30 poises at 250C on a Garbner bubble viscometer.EXAMPLE III One hundred parts of the solution of Example II was mixed with sufficient dibromoneopentyl glycol fumarate to provide a bromine level of 5 parts hundred of resin, and one and one half parts of colloidal antimony oxide. Nine and three tenths parts of trichloroethylphosphate and two parts of methylethyl ketone peroxide as an initiator were added with continuous mixing. Thirty parts of chopped strand glass mat was impregnated with the above mixture. The resulting product was then cast as a flat panel about 1 mm thick and was set into a polymerized composition by raising the temperature to about 800C and aging for a period of twelve hours.EXAMPLE IV The panel of Example III was tested to determine flame retardancy by the oxygen index test. The oxygen index test is described in Modern Plastics, Larch, 1970, p. 124 and may broadly be described as the nlinimal volume percent of oxygen in a slowly rising oxygen nitrogen atmosphere that will sustain a candle like burning of the resin panel when the panel is ignited at the top. The panel tested was found to have an oxygen index of 33.0 and a tensile strength of 14,200 psi.
