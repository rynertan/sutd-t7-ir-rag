## Abstract
A fluid pressure energy translating device 10 of the sliding vane type comprising a cam ring 13 including an internal contour 30 , a rotor 25 having a plurality of vanes 36 rotatable therewith and slidable relative thereto in slots in the rotor 25 with one end of each vane 36 engaging the internal contour 30 . The rotor 25 and internal contour 30 cooperate to define one or more pumping chambers 31, 32 between the periphery of the rotor and the cam contour through which the vanes 36 pass carrying fluid from an in let port 19 to an outlet port 22 . At least one cheek plate 16, 17 is associated with the body 11 and rotor 25 . Two pressure chambers 39, 40 are formed for each vane 36 and each vane has two piston surfaces, one in each cham ber, both being effective under pressure in the respective chambers 39, 40 to urge the vanes into engagement with the cam 13 . A generally annular internal feed passage 44 is formed entirely within the rotor 25 and communicates with one set 39 of the pressure chambers. A radial pas sage 41 is provided on each vane 36 extending from the tip of the base thereof, so that cyclically changing pressure is supplied to the other set 40 of chambers. Arcuate grooves 49a, b are provided in the face of the cheek plate 16, 17 in the dwell zones, and a hydrostatic pressure pad 48 is associated with the opposite face of the cheek plate 16, 17 and circumscribes the arcuate grooves 49a, b . An opening 50 extends from the arcuate grooves 49a, b through the cheek plate 16, 17 to the hydrostatic area 48 .
