## Description
This invention concerns genetically engineered organisms which express surface proteins of Two major surface antigens on Recombinant plasmids harboring clones of double stranded cDNA for coding an insect stage specific surface glycoprotein of This invention especially relates to a plasmid plF8 as deposited at the ATCC at Rockvolle, Maryland, USA, on September 27, 1983 under No. 400 82. The invention also relates to said plasmid in a suitable host bacterium, especially Escherichia coli K 12. The invention further relates to a DNA sequence which expresses the peptide portion of the surface insect stage 75.000 Dalton glycoprotein of Trypanosoma cruzi which consists of the base pairs being the difference between plF8 and puCl3. The DNA sequence can have about 600 base pairs. It is a further object of the invention to provide a plasmid containing the DNA sequence of claim 4 or 5. Another object of the invention is to provide a method for producing the peptide portion of the surface insect stage 75.000 Dalton glycoprotein of T. cruzi which comprises expressing a plasmid of claim 1 or claim 6 or a plasmid containing a DNA coding for the same peptide as the plasmids of claims 1 and 6. A more particular object of the present invention is a method of diagnosing Chagas disease in vitro comprising contacting the IgG containing fraction of blood from a potential patient having chagas disease with peptides produced according to claim 8 in an immunological reaction. Details on the isolation, and characterization of the Mr 75,000 and Mr 90,000 surface glycoproteins of The plasmids disclosed in the present invention bear the deposit number PlF8 and are deposited with The Rockefeller University, 1230 York Avenue, New Yor, New York 10021. Preferred plasmids of the present invention are also deposited at the American Type culture Collection, Bethesda, Maryland and bear ATCC deposit number 40082. Poly A RNA was isolated from 3 week old strain epimastigote cultures, purified by oligo dT cellulose chromotography, and translated The total poly A RNA was converted to cDNA with reverse transcriptase. The double stranded cDNA was inserted into the Pst I site of the plasmid pUCl3 by G C tailing and the recombinant plasmids used to transform Bacterial cells were transferred to nitrocellulose filters, grown overnight, and lysed Analysis of plasmid DNA from these eight clones showed inserts ranging in size from 100 base pairs to 600 base pairs. Thus, even short insert sequences can produce antigenic fragments recognized by polyvalent serum. Because of its unusual culture morphology, one clone, plT8, was chosen for further study. Unlike the other immunoreactive clones or its JM83 parent, plf8 grows in liquid culture as a rough strain which suggests that the trypanosome polypeptide may be expressed on the bacterial cell surface. plF8 contains a pUCl3 plasmid with a cDNA insert of 600 base pairs. To prove its trypanosome origin, the ³² P labelled insert was hybridized with trypanosome DNA in a Southern blot. The cloned DNA hybridized to several fragments generated by Hind II, Pst I, Sal I, or BamH I digestion of total DNA isolated form epimastigotes. These restriction enzymes do not cut the 600 basepair insert itself. This multiple banding pattern could result from the presence of intervening sequences or multiple gene copies. The ³² P labelled insert was also used as the probe in a Northern blot of epimastigote RNA. The probe hybridized to an RNA of approximately 1000 nucleotides in both total RNA and polyA RNA preparations. It also hybridized to a second species of approximately 2100 nucleotides in the total RNA. In comparison, there is very little hybridization in a Northern blot of total RNA or polyA RNA isolated from vertebrate stage parasites tryptomastigotes . The 2100 nucleotide species is also present in the total tryptomastigote RNA. The results of these blot experiments strongly suggest stage specific mRNA processing. The difference in size between the 1000 nucleotide mRNA and the 600 base pair cDNA insert indicates that the pIF8 clone must not code for a full length gene. However, since the patient serum is able to react with the bacteria, the clone must encode and express at least one epitope. Nogueira has shown that all Chagas disease patient sera tested recognize the same trypanosome antigens. Therefore, the plF8 clone is likely to be useful in the diagnosis of the chronic illness. After lysis and washing, the filters were incubated for two hours at room temperature with the IgG fraction of Chagas disease patient serum diluted 1 300 into 50 This interaction between clone and lung antibodies against the surface protein of T. cruzi in human serum forms an essential basis for a diagnostic method for Chagas disease. These cloned peptides or their synthetic counterparts may be used in this method. The RNA samples were electrophoresed on a 1 The filter paper was pre hybridized for 4 hours at 42 C in 50 formamide, 5XSSC, 4X Denhardt s buffer, 0.1 SDS, and 10 dextran sulfate. It was then hybridized for 12 hours in this same solution containing the ³²P labelled plF8 probe and 100 ug ml
