Nine unfasted Swiss Webster male mice Buc 2 berg Labs weighing 20 30 g are equally divided into three groups for each drug dose to be tested. That is, data for each dose level was generated by 3 separate groups of 3 mice each. Drugs. A minimum of three dose levels 10, 30, and 100 mgfkg are tested for each drug.Treatments are administered intraperitoneally one hour prior to testing All dosages are calculated as parent compound and given in volumes of 10 ml kg. Compounds are dissolved or suspended in 0.2 Methocel. Control animals are injected with Methocel.TESTING A two part testing procedure is started one hour post injection. First, the screen test is performed seePharmac. Biochem. Behav. 6, 351 353, 1977 . Briefly this test consists of placing mice on individual wire screens which are then rotated 180 degrees at the start of a 60 second observation period. The number of mice falling off the inverted screen is recorded. Immediately following the screen test, the final phase of testing is initiated by placing each group of 3 mice in one actophotometer Life Sciences, 22, 1067 1076, 1978 . The actophotometer consists of a cylindrical chamber whose center is occupied by another cylinder which contains the illumination for 6 photocells located on the perimeter of the chamber Six light beam interruptions equal one count. Locomotor activity is recorded by computer at 10 minute intervals for 60 minutes. DATA The data obtained from the screen test are expressed as percent of mice falling off the screen. Data derived from locomotor activity of drug treated mice are compared to the activity of vehicle treated animals and are expressed as percent inhibition of spontaneous locomotion. All percentages reported for inhibition of locomotion are based upon data accumulate for one hour. Both phases of testing are graded A 60 1009s, C 31 59I and N 0 30s6. An overall dose rating is obtained by the following criteria Inhibition of Screen Test Dose Locomotion Rating with Failure Rating Rating A N or C A A A C C N or C C All other combinations NCompounds which exhibit an overall dose rating of A at a dose of 100 milligrams kilogram or less are considered active.Utilizing this procedure, an overall dose rating of A was obtained for the noted compound at the indicated dose.

PROCEDURE Mature male Long Evans rats or squirrel monkeys are conditioned to push a lever in order to avoid a painful electric footshock. If the animal fails to push the lever, he receives a shock every 10 seconds until the lever is pushed Shocks can be terminated by pushing the lever. Thereafter, as long as the lever is pushed at least once every 20 seconds, there will be no shock. Each animal acts as its own control one weekly session is used to establish baseline behavior and another session later in the week is used as a drug session. Once patterns of avoidance are established, the effects of standard and unknown compounds are studied. RESPONSE EVALUATION All events are electronically programmed and the response to these events counted or used as feed back to the program.

For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the compounds described by this invention, inert, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid. Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, dispersible granules, capsules, cachets and suppositories. A solid carrier can be one or more substances which may also act as diluents, flavoring agents, solubilizers, lubricants, suspending agents1 binders or tablet disintegrating agents it can also be an encapsulating material. In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid which is in admixture with the finely divided active compound. In the tablet the active compound is mixed with carrier having the necessary binding properties in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired. The powders and tablets preferably contain from 5 or 10 to about 70 percent of the active ingredient.Suitable solid carriers are magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, a low nelting wax, cocoa butter and the like The term preparation is intended to include the formulation of the active compound with encapsulating material as carrier providing a capsule in which the active component with or without other carriers is surrounded by carrier, which is thus in association with it. Similarly, cachets are includedTablets, powders, cachets and capsules can be used as solid dosage forms suitable for oral administration. Liquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions and emulsions As an example may be mentioned water or water propylene glycol solutions for parenteral injection.Liquid preparations can also be formulated in solution in aqueous polyethylene glycol solution. Aqueous solutions suitable for oral use can be prepared by dissolving the active component in water and adding suitable colorants, flavors, stabilizing and thickening agents as desired. Aqueous suspensionsuitable for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely divided active component in water with viscous material, l.e., natural or synthetic gums, resins, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and other well known suspending agents. Preferably, the pharmaceutical preparation is in unit dosage form. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component.The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of preparation, for example, packeted tablets, capsules and powders in vials, or ampoules. The unit dosage form can also be a capsule, cachet or tablet itself or it can be the appropriate number of any of these packaged form. The quantity of active compound in a unit dose of preparation may be varied or adjusted from 1 mg to 100 mg according to the particular application and the potency of the active ingredient. In therapeutic use as agents for treating psychoses in mammals, the compounds utilized in the pharmaceutical method of this invention are administered at the initial dosage of about 0.1 mg to about 100 mg per kilogram daily. A daily dose range of about 1.0 mg to about 50 mg per kilogram is preferred. The dosages, however, may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient, the severity of the condition being treated and the compound being employed. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the art.Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and adminfstered in portions during the day if desired. The following non limiting examples illustrate the inventors preferred methods for preparing the compounds of the invention.
