# Printing and cutter unit for a cash register or the like.

## Abstract
The invention provides a printing device in which a cutter unit 10 for a medium to be printed is rotatably supported by a pivot 11 on the printing device body 1 and located in such a position as to permit the printing head 2 portion to be covered or exposed. The cutter unit, in its closed inoperable state, is interlockingly operated through an engaging lever 21 by a separate drive system housed in the device body 1 , but may be brought into or out of an interlocking engagement with the drive system, whereby a series of maintenance and checking operations such as the mounting and replacement of the ink ribbon 8 , the cleaning of the interior of the printing device body 1 and the removal of a jammed paper 9 are carried out.
