## Abstract
In packing machines of the type which manufacture packing containers with liquid contents a filling pipe with a valve arrangement situated at the outlet end is frequently used. The valve arrangement in accordance with the present invention comprises a movable valve element which is manoeuvred with the help of pressure variations in the filling pipe. The movable valve element is cup shaped and is adapted so that it is lifted through excess pressure in the filling pipe from a fixed disc shaped seat so that an annular discharge opening results.
