# A gate control.

## Abstract
The opening 1 between a pair of fence posts 2 is controlled by a flexible coiled wire 5 connected from one post 2 at one end to a catch 9 at the other end. A control module 13 enables the time and day to be set at which the catch 9 will automatically release the wire 5 and also operate an audible signalling means 14 . Animals restrained from passing through the opening 1 by the wire 5 preferably electrified by being connected through a lead 11 to one of the electrified wires 3 of an electric fence, will become conditioned by the sounding of the horn 14 to appreciate that the gate is now open so that they can now pass through e.g. into the next pasture.
