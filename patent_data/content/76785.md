# A rolling shutter.

## Abstract
A rolling shutter comprising a plurality of wood lists A provided in one side, of a jutting semicylindrical rib tongue 1 connected to a list body 3 by a neck 2 with advanced abutment 5 if compared with the opposite 7 and in the opposite side, of a semicylindrical groove 4 with a nib 5 to realize a semicylindrical loose grooving and tonguing articulation with abutments 5, 5 in front and clearance 6 at the rolling back.

## Claims
Claims 1. h rolling shutter constituted by a plurality of idertical elongate lists A or different elongate lists A , A ,articulated one another, characterived in that said articulation is realized by an elongate seinicylincrical loose groove and tongue wherein said groove is hollowed out in total lenght, in the body of said lists 4 and said tongue is jutted in total lenght from the body of the opposite adjacent list 1 . 2. A rolling shutter as claimed in claim 1, in which said semicylindrical jutting rib tongue 1 is connected to the body 3 by a neck 2 in total lenght of the list. 3. A rolling shutter as claimed in claims 1, 2 in which said semicylindrical groove 4 is hollowed out in the body 3 in the opposite side of the rib tongue 1 . 4. A rolling shutter as claimed in claim 2 in which said neck 2 of semicylindrical jutting rib tongue 1 , connect an identical semicylindrical jutting rib tongue 1 in the opposite side and in which said list body 3 hollowing said semicylindrical groove 4 , hollow cutie the opposite side an identical semicylindrical groove 4 . 5. A rolling shutter as claimed in claim 1, 2 and 3, in which said body 3 of the list A , near the neck 2 of the jutting rib tongue 1 , is provided with an advanced abutment 5 ifcar eredwith the opposite 7 , being the grooved side further provided in opposite direction of a nib 5 to allow the abutment 5 5 in the articulation with another list A and to realize a clearance 6 on the other side of the neck to allow the rolling only in one direction.

## Description
A rolling shutterThe invention relates to a rolling shutter. With the denomination rolling shutter is intended all structure to realize an articulated wall or articulated panel constituted with a plurality of elongate lists articulated one another to realize a jointed structure as a rolling shutters for furniture or curtain walls or articulated and hinged doors and similar structures, rolling shutters or blinds for windows included.Different types of rolling shutters are well known in prior art but all this ones are realized with separate articualted joints. Prefererably each hinging or articulation is realized by a metallic hinge joint that hooks one list to another, this is very complicated and expensive and cause considerable wear.The invention as claimed is intended to provide a remedy, realizing a rolling shutter with a plurality of lists jointable one to another in articulation without separate intermediate hinge joints made in different material.On this basis the invention solves the problem utilizing a plurality of lists comprising, in their opposite elongate sides to be jointed in articulation, a semicircular cylindrical loose grove and tongue allowing the transversal rotation of the two opposite jointed lists, being said elongate groove hollowed out in semi cylindrical form in the body of the list with open slot and said tongue jutted from the body of the opposite list in an elongated semicylindrical rib form by an elongate neck connection.The advantages offered by the invention are mainly the production of the rolling shutters in a plurality of wood or plastic lists that can be jointed one another without intermediate hinge joints.One way of carrying out the invention is described in detail below with reference to drawings which illustrate three specific embodiments, in which Figure 1 is a indoor frontal view of the rolling shutter in the rolling side Figure 2 is a perspective in transversal section and opposite outside view of the rolling shutter of figure 1 Figure 3 is a transversal section view of an alternative embodiment Figure 4 is a transversal section view of a further alternative embodiment.The figures show a plurality of identical shaped lists A articulated one another figures 2, 3 ,being in alternative embodiment said lists different shaped one another A , A , Figure 4 .in the preferred embodiment the lists are identical one another and each list comprise in one side a protruded rib in senicylindrical form 1 connected to a list bod 3 by a neck 2 and in the opposite side a semi cylindrical groove 4 to receive the insertion of the semicylindrical opposite identical rib 1 of other list A to form the grooving and tonguing articulation and so on.In the specific e bodimen of Figure 2 the shutter can be rolled only in one direction arrows direction bemuse in the opposite direction each list is provided with a nib 5 abuting on the opposite abutment 5 of the adjacent list, being said abutment 5 advanced if compared with the opposite 7 to realize under the neck 2 in said rolling side a clearance 6 to allow the rolling. If the rolling is desired in both directions, the nib 5 and the abutment 5 can be eliminated and replaced in simmetrical fona corresponding to rolling side as represented in Figure 3 utilizing a single type of grooving and tonguing lists A .In the embodiment represented in Figure 4, the shutter is realized utilizing two different lists being the first one with two opposite semicylindrical tongue ribs 1 connected by a neck 2 and the second one with two opposite semicylindrical grooves 4. 1
