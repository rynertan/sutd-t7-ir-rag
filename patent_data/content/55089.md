## Description
Title Improvements in or relating to Disc Record Players The present invention relates to a disc record player comprising a turntable for supporting a disc record, a motor for rotating the turntable, and a pick up arm mounted for pivotal movement relative to the turntable axis and adjusted to carry an electro mechanical transducer, hereinafter referred to as a pick up, and has particular application to switching means for energising a motor adapted to rotate the turntable of the disc record player. In the past it has been usual to provide switching means which, in a manually operable disc record player is operated manually to start rotation of the t t rn table. In automatically operated disc record player, a manually operable switch may be provided with starts a sequence of events, including energisation oir a motor to rotate the turntable, such energistation may occur on operation of the manually operable switch or at a later stage during said sequence of events. It is an object of the present invention to provide in or for a disc record player improved switching means to permit energisatLon of the motor. According to the present invention we provide a disc record player switching means adapted to permit of energisation of a motor for rotating the disc record player turntable, said switching means being associated with a pick up arm rest on which the pick up arm is supported in an at rest position when not in use, characterised in that said switching means comprising a single movable member having a first position in which energisation of the motor is possible, and a second position in which energisation of the motor is prevented and in that the pick up arm comprises said single movable member and said second position comprises said at rest position of said pick up arm. The switching means of the present invention has the advantage of being adapted to cause energisation of a motor for rotating a disc record player in a manner that does not entail any significant force having to be applied by the pick up arm. The switching means being operable in response to the presence or absence of the pick up arm from the rest. Thus the switching means is operable even by arms which are counterbalanced by an amount which results in a very small tracking weight at the pick up. Such small tracking weight is a common feature of good quality disc record players. The switching means may comprise a solid state switching device or circuit having sensing means adapted to sense when the pick up arm is in its at rest position, said sensing means being operative on removal of the pick up arm from its rest may cause some change in said solid state switching device or circuit to permit of energisation of the motor. Such sensing means may operate on the principle that the presence of the pick up arm on its rest causes a change in capacitance, inductance, or resistance in the sensing means associated with the circuit. Any reactive forces on the pick up arm are so small as to be insignificant. As a further alternative, the switching means may comprise sensing means adapted to respond to a change in light conditions, such a change being dependent upon the presence or absence of the pick up arm from its rest.The responsive means being operative to energise the motor when the pick up arm is removed from the rest.With such switching means being adapted to respond to a change in light conditions, there will be no reactive force on the pick up arm at all. The light responsive means may be adapted to operate in ambient light conditions, the arrangement being such that when the pick up arm is on its rest the light responsive means is covered or at least shaded by the pick up arm, removal of the arm from the rest allowing light or an increase in light to fall on the light responsive means which may itself be adapted to generate a voltage e.g. a photo cell, or change the conditions in an electrical circuit e.g. a photo resistor. Such a voltage or change is arranged by connection of the light responsive means in a suitable circuit to cause energisation of the motor. In addition to the light responsive means there may be provided a light source, for example a light emitting diode, the pick up arm being arranged to either break or complete a light path between the light emitting member and the light responsive member. According to a further aspect of the invention we provide a disc record player having a turntable driven by an electric motor, and a pick up arm made, at least partially, from an electrically conductive material, and arranged such that, when in an Rat rest position on a pick up arm rest, an electrical circuit is completed so as to cause de energisation of the motor. In one such an arrangement one electrical connection to the pick up arm may be made through the pick up arm support bearing, and an electrical contact may be provided on the pick up arm rest for co operation with the conductive part of the pick up arm itself. The arrangement may be such that when the arm is on the rest an electrical circuit is completed, the completion of said circuit being operative to open circuit a current supply circuit to the motor. Removal of the arm from the rest interrupts the said electrical circuit which has the effect of allowing current to be supplied to the motor through the current supply circuit. The pick up arm for example be made wholly or partially from aluminium. It is necessary for the pick up arm to carry wires from the pick up to a connection whereby the pick up can be connected to amplifier means. The pick up arm may be adapted to carry a further wire connected to an electrically conductive contact provided on the pick up arm, which contact is situate at least partially on the outer surface of the pick up arm and adapted to co operate with a further contact provided on the rest. The contact provided on the rest is connected in an electrical circuit, the arrangement being such that when the contact on the pick up arm and the contact on the rest are in contact with each other, a circuit is completed to cause de energisation of the motor and, as soon as the pick up arm is removed from the rest, said circuit is broken to allow energisation of the motor. The completing of a circuit by positioning the pickup arm on its rest may be adapted to change the current flowing in a semi conductor switching circuit to cause energisation or de energisation of the motor depending on the absence or presence of the pick up arm on the rest respectively. Such circuits may be arranged in a manner such that the current flowing through the circuit, including the contacts between the arm and the rest, is very small. Delay means may be provided whereby the absence of the pick up arm from its rest does not immediately cause energisation of the motor such that inadvertent movement for a brief period of time such as vibration to which the arm may be subjected does not cause unwanted energisation of the motor. In a still further alternative, the pick up arm rest may be provided with a pair of contacts, which pair of contacts are closed by contact with an electrically conductive pick up arm or electrically conductive part associated therewith, the contacts being connected in a circuit operative when the contacts are open to cause energisation of the motor. Two of the embodiments of the present invention will now be described in more detail, with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein FIGURE 1 is a schematic view of a record player turntable and pick up arm assembly FIGURE 2 is a schematic diagram of a first arrangement of the switching means of the present invention and FIGURE 3 is an alternative arrangement of switching means including switching delay means. Referring first to Figure 1, a turntable 10 is mounted on a base plate 11 for rotation about a spindle 12. The turntable 10 is rotated by a motor 13, the spindle 14 of which is connected to the turntable by a drive belt 15. A pick up arm generally indicated at 16 has a mount 17 supported by the base plate 11, which support 17 provides a pivotal mounting for the pick up arm 16 which comprises a pick up 19 at one end, and a counterbalance weight 20 is provided at the other end. The pick up arm 16 is supported, when in an at rest position, on a pick up arm rest 21. The motor 13 is controlled from a motor control circuit 22 connected to the motor 13 by wires 23 and supplied with power from a power supply connected to input terminals 24. A further connector 25 connects the motor control circuit 22 to the pick up arm 16 which is made from an electrically conductive material. The pick up arm rest 21 is provided with an electrical contact so positioned that the contact will be in electrical contact with the arm 16 when the pick up arm 16 is in its at rest position. The electrical contact in the support 21 is connected to wire 26. The arrangement is such that when the pick up arm 16 is in its at rest position, a circuit between the wires 25 and 26 is completed by the pick up arm 18. The completion of this circuit will be operative to de energise the motor 13 so that the turntable 10 will not be rotated. Removal of the pick up arm 16 from its rest 21 will cause circuit comprising wires 25 and 26 to open thus influencing the motor control circuit 22 to cause energisation of the motor 13 to rotate the turntable 10. Referring now to Figure 2, a simplified circuit for causing energisation or de energisation of the motor 13 is illustrated. The pick up arm 16 is made from electrically conductive material such as aluminium. The pick up arm rest 21 has a first upwardly extending part 30, a second upwardly extending part 31 and a recess 32 between the upwardly extending parts, in which recess 32 the pick up arm 16 is supported. The upwardly extending parts 30 and 31 preventing undesired horizontal movement of the pick up arm 16 from its rest 21. A supporting surface 33 at the base of the recess 32 has an electrically conductive contact 34 extending upwardly, just proud of the surface 33. The contact 34 is electrically connected by a conductor 35 through wire 26 to the base of an NPN transistor 37. The emitter of transistor 37 is connected to line 38 and both to line 25 which is connected to the pick up arm 16 and to the negative terminal 24. The line 25 is in electrical connection with the pick up arm 16 and is connected thereto in any suitable manner which does not adversely affect the movement of the pick up arm 16. The connection could, for example, be made through the support bearing by means of which the pick up arm 16 is supported relative to the base plate 11. The collector of transistor 37 is connected through a motor drive circuit 39 to the positive terminal of aD.C. supply through line 40. The positive of the D.C.supply is also connected to the base of transistor 37 through resistor 41. When the pick up arm 16 is supported by the rest 21, the base of transistor 37 will be connected through line 26, conductor 35, contact 34, pick up arm 16 and line 25 to the negative terminal. Thus, there will be no forward bias on the base of transistor 37 relative to the emitter. The transistor 37 will therefore be nonconducting or switched off . When the pick up arm 16 is removed from the rest, the line 26 and hence the base of transistor 37 will no longer be connected to the negative of the D.C. supply terminal 24 since the base of transistor 3Y will remain connected through resistor 41 the positive of the supply, the base will become forward biased relative to the emitter thus rendering the transistor 37 conductive or switched on and connecting the motor drive circuit 39 to the D.C. supply terminals 24 thus enabling energisation of the motor 13 through lines 23. As soon as the pick up 5 is replaced on the rest 21, the base of transistor 37 will once again be connected directly to the negative terminal of the supply terminals 24 thereby removing the forward bias from the base of the transistor 37 and the transistor 37 will switch off, disconnecting the motor drive circuit 39 from the supply, therefore the motor 13 will no longer be energised and the turntable will cease to be driven. Referring now to Figure 3, an alternative arrangement is shown in which a slightly different method of completing a circuit through the pick up arm is utilised and a switching circuit incorporating delay means is used instead of the switching circuit shown in Figure 2. In the embodiment shown, the pick up arm 50 is supported by a pick up arm rest 51, the pick up arm rest 51 being provided with an electrically conductive contact 52 and the arm 50 is provided with an electrically conductive contact 53 which is electrically connected to line 54. The contact 52 is electrically connected to line 55. When the arm 50 is in place on the rest 51, line 54 is in electrical connection with line 55 through contacts 52 and 53. If the arm 50 is removed from the rest 51, the contacts 52 and 53 are opened disconnecting line 54 from 55. Line 54 is connected between resistors 56 and 57, resistor 56 being connected to a positive supply terminal 57 and also to motor drive circuit 58. Motor drive circuit 58 has a pair of terminals 59 connected to the motor for rotating the turntable. Resistor 57 is connected to the base of transistor 60, the emitter of which is connected to the base of transistor 61, the emitter of which is connected to the negative supply terminal 62 and line 55. Between line 55 and the base of transistor 60 is a capacitor 63. When the pick up arm 50 is in position on its rest 51 and line 54 is electrically connected to line 55 through contacts 52 and 53, line 54 will be connected to the negative terminal zero volts thus capacitor 63 will be discharged and the base of transistor 60 also at zero volts thus transistors 60 and 61 will both be nonconducting. When the pick up arm 50 is removed from the rest 51, line 54 will be disconnected from the negative terminal thus capacitor 63 will charge from the positive supply terminal through resistors 56 and 57 until transistor 60 is sufficiently forward biased to conduct which in turn will cause the potential of the base of transistor 61 to rise causing transistor 61 to conduct and thus switch on the power supply to the motor drive circuit 58. When the arm 50 is replaced on the rest, line 54 will once again be connected to the negative terminal 62 allowing capacitor 63 to discharge through resistor 57, the value of which is selected that a transistor 60 and 61 turn off gradually to avoid any interference. A significant advantage is obtained in providing two transistors 60 and 61 rather than a single transistor since the current that flows through lines 55 and 54 and hence through the contacts 51 and 52 is significantly reduced when the pick up arm 50 is in position on the rest 51. The resistors 56, 57 and capacitor 63 provide delay means whereby current will not immediately be supplied to motor drive circuit 58 and hence the motor to drive the turntable until the shorter time has elapsed after the pick up arm 50 has been removed from the rest 51. Such delay means ensures that if for example the record player turntable assembly is subjected to any vibration, causing frequent and instantaneous making and breaking of the contacts 52 and 53, the motor drive circuit 58 will not be supplied with power and hence the motor 13 will not be continually switched on and off, which switching may well cause interference in radio receiving apparatus for example. The switching means of the present invention has been described in the specific embodiments with reference to physical contacts, one on the arm and one on the support, however, it will be appreciated that as aforementioned other forms of switching means in which the presence of the pick up arm 50 on its rest 51 may cause a change in the light responsive device or a change in inductance or capacitance in a circuit may alternatively be employed, such switching means having the advantage that the lines 25 in the first embodiment and 54 in the second embodiment may not be necessary.
