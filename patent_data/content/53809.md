# Apparatus and process for cooling and solidifying molten material being electromagnetically cast.

## Abstract
An apparatus 10 and process is provided for magnetically casting molten material into a desired shape 14 . A containment zone 22 is established. The contain ment zone has a first section 16 for electromagnetically containing the molten material and a second section 20 downstream and communicating with the first section for forming the molten material into the desired shape. The improvement comprises a heat extraction device for direct ing a cooling medium into the containment zone 22 whereby the cooling medium passes the molten material in the second section to rapidly solidify the molten material prior to passing the molten material in the first section to lower the temperature in the contained molten material to minimize superheating. A second embodiment of the inven tion includes a secondary cooling device associated with the heat extraction device for directing a cooling medium against the solidified material. A further embodiment pro vides an auxiliary cooling manifold 100 device which may or may not be used in conjunction with the heat extraction device and the second cooling device. The auxiliary cooling device directs a cooling medium through the containment zone between the molten material and the device for establishing a containment zone whereby the cooling medium is vented out of the upstream end of the contain ment zone.
