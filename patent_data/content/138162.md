# CMOS STRUCTURE

## Abstract
In order to enhance resistance to positive feedback latch up, a CMOS structure includes a degeneratively doped n grid 28 buried in the p epitaxial layer 12 to intercept elec trons injected into the epitaxial layer 12 before they can flow into an FET containing n well 30 . The n well 30 is formed in the p epitaxial layer 12 which is supported on a degeneratively doped p substrate 10 . A first FET including a grounded n source 22 and an n drain 24 with an associated gate 26 is separated by re cessed oxide region 20 from a second FET including a posi tively biased p source 14 and a p drain 16 formed in the n well 30 . The p substrate is biased to behave like a very efficient hole collector, allowing a minimum number of holes to flow to the p epi region to cause positive feedback for the n p junction. However, the p substrate cannot handle the electrons injected from the n source and positive feedback can be created between the p n junction between the n source and the p substrate. The buried degeneratively doped n grid in tercepts the electrons injected into the epitaxial region before they can flow into the n well and create a positive feedback condition.
