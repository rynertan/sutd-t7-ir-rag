# Vehicle spring suspension arrangement.

## Abstract
A vehicle such as a 6 2 tractor having at least three axles is provided with a novel leaf spring suspension 1 for its middle axle. When the load, imposed on the chassis by a semi trailer, exceeds a predetermined threshold, the free, rear, end of the leaf spring 1 engages the under surface of the upper portion of a slipper bracket 4 attached to the chassis, and the middle axle takes a proportion of the load. With loads below the threshold, the free end drops through a vertical air gap and is held by a lower supporting arm on the slipper bracket, the middle axle being unloaded. The rear, driving axle is thus more heavily loaded when ever the vehicle is part laden, ensuring greater traction.
