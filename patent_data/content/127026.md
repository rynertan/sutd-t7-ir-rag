# Telescoping steering shaft with adjusted lash.

## Abstract
A telescoping steering column is provided of the type wharein a wedge plug 54 and innermost shaft portion 17 are axially wound relatively to each other by rotation of a threaded rotatable control rod 44 to thereby lock and release the innermost shaft portion relative to another shaft portion 19 . First and second stop means 62, 65 are provided to respectively stop the control rod and the one of the two ele ments innermost shaft portion or wedge plug that is not threaded to the threaded control rod against relative axial movement in our direction and in the opposite direction. The first and second step means allow a limited axial lost motion between the rotatable control rod and the said one element when the direction of the rotatable control rod is reversed so as to axially disengage one of the stop means and move the rod axially toward the other by the stop means.
