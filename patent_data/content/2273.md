# A PROCESS FOR PRODUCING A CHROMIUM BASED OLEFIN POLYMERIZATION CATALYST, THE CATALYST SO PREPARED AND ITS USE

## Abstract
A support suitable for supporting chromium to produce a catalyst capable of giving high melt flow olefin polymers for such applications as injection molding and the like requiring a narrow molecular weight distribution, is produced by treating the support at an elevated temperature with either 1 CO, 2 a bromine component, or 3 an oxygen containing sulfur component. Thereafter, anhydrous chromium can be added, for instance, by means of a hydrocarbon solution of a soluble chromium compound, and the resulting composition activated in air to produce a catalyst. The bromine treated silica is also suitable for use as a reinforcing agent in rubber or plastics and as a support for a chromatographic column.
