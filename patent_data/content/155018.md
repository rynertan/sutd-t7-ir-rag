## Description
Arrangement for supervising the functions of a memory device. The invention relates to an arrangement for supervising the functions of a memory device for storing parity bit containing data words, each having m bits m N 2 the arrangement comprising dividing means for dividing the data words into n n 2 sub data words, and the memory device comprising n separate sub memory devices each coupled to the dividing means for storing a sub data word in each of the n sub memory devices. It is customary to provide data words with one or a plurality of parity bits so as to render it possible to check after a processing operation has been effected on the data word reading, writting, storing etc. whether the operation has been effected correctly and has not led to the introduction of an error into the data word. An arrangement for checking the parts is disclosed in United StatesPatent 3.972.033. From the following and similar cases it has been found that this manner of checking is not fool proof. Let it be assumed that each time a word has been entered in a register the parity of the entered word is checked. In the case that the writing operation is interrupted, the parity of each data word remaining in the register will be determined again and if its parity was correct the error will remain unnoticed.In the case of, for example, addressing followed by reading the addressed memory location, a similar incident may occur. If the addressing is incorrect, the parity of a data word which should not be there at that moment will be checked and if that parity is correct, this word will pass the parity check unnoticed. The invention has for its object to provide an arrangement for supervising a memory device, with which the write, storage and addressing functions are supervised in a simple way. According to the invention, an arrangement of the type set forth in the opening paragraph, is characterized in that the arrangement comprises a parity checking device connected to the sub memory devices for checking the parity of the n associated sub data words which form one data word. As the sub memory devices consist of e.g. physically separate circuits, the risk that they will make the same errors at the same time is so small as to be disregarded, so that generally an error in the write, memory or addressing function in one of the circuits will be detected almost without exception. Advantageously, the sub data words each comprise m n bits and each memory location of the sub memory devices can also contain m n bits. It is further advantageous for the dividing means to comprise a register having m bit positions and for the register to have n groups of outputs for the respective m n bits sub data words. An eoodiment of the invention and the advantages thereof will now be described in greater detail by way of example with reference to the accompanying Figures. Therein Fig. 1 is a block circuit diagram of an embodiment of the invention and Fig. 2 shows a sub memory device for use in the embodiment shown in Fig. 1. Dividing means R in Fig. 1 have an input IN for receiving data words DW. The dividing means can more specifically be consituted by a register having as many bit positions as there are bits in the data words, for example m m 4 2 . The dividing means divide a data word DW into a number n of sub data words SDW. The further detailed description of Fig. 1 is based on the assumption that an m bit data word is divided into 3 sub data words each having m 3 bits, namely SOW1, SDW2 and SsW3. The data word I includes a parity bitPB which in the example shown in Fig. 1 occupies the last bit position.With the aid of the parity bit it can be checked whether the parity of the marl data bits is correct, that is to say whether the orbit data word contains either an even or an odd number of ones or zeroes . The three generally n sub data words are transferred to sub registers SR1, SR2 and SR3 via their respective outputs 01, 02and O3 at an instant determined by write pulses WP1 WP2 and WP3. Each one of the sub registers SR. i 1, 2, 3 has at least m n here m 3 bit positions. The sub registers SR. are formed by e.g. physically separate, therefore independently realised circuits and are activated by write pulses which are also generated independently of each other. Outputs of sub registers SRi are connected to a prior art parity checking arrangement PC, which determines whether the generated parity across the nrldatabits m n from SR1, m n fromSR2 and m n l from SR3 corresponds to the transferred parity last bit in SR3 . An output OUT of the parity checking arrangementPC supplies a signal which is indicative of whether the parity is correct or not correct. If the recording or write function of one of the subregisters SR. fails, this will result in the described arrangement according to the invention in a parity error, which implies that the recording and write functions are supervised by means of the parity. Generally, the arrangement shown in Fig. 1 does not comprise sub registers SRi each having one memory location, but comprises sub memory devices Mi which, as shown in Fig. 2, have n memory locations. The sub data word SDWi is then entered into the memory location determined by the address decoder Maxi. E eThe address decoder MA. determines this location on the basis of the applied addressing information AP If the recording, write or addressing function of one of the sub memory devices M. fails, this will result in a parity error in the described arrangement according to the invention. In this way the recording, write and addressing functions are supervised by means of the parity. The above description of the embodiment is based on the assumption that the data word is divided into sub data words each comprising an equal number of bits, namely m n bits. This is, however, not absolutely necessary the invention is also suitable for use with embodiments using any other dividing mode. Obviously the number of bits which must be available per memory location in each sub memory device must be in agreement with the selected dividing mode. In the foregoing it was stipulated that each sub register or each sub memory device must be activated with a separately generated write pulse. However, it is possible to use on write pulse only, provided that this write pulse is supervised separately. This supervision may be omitted when this pulse is doubled generally made into a multiple . The generation of the write pulses for a plurality of sub registers or a plurality of sub memory devices may be combined without any objection, provided that always at least two independent write pulses are used. Advantageously, three subdata words are formed each comprising 4 bits.
