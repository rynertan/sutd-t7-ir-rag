# Digital graphics display systems.

## Abstract
A graphics generator operates on the digital co ordinates of resolution points of a display device by recursive calculation of a Taylor expansion from a starting point about nearby resolution points to generate display figures such as vectors, circles and arcs. Absolute values of decision variables f x , f y , f xy corresponding to terms of the Taylor expansion are derived in arithmetic circuits 30,34 32,36 40, 42, 44 . The values are supplied to a selector circuit 38 which selects by comparison of the values the resolution point associated with the smallest value, and causes running co ordinate counters 64, 66 to be updated accordingly. The decision variable associated with the selected point is also used as basis f x for calculating the next group of decision variables. The co ordinates stored in the counters 64,66 are applied to control the display device 82 . The generator provides real time generation of display figures and may be used with raster scan or beam position CRT displays.
