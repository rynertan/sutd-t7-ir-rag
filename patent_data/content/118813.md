# Curvilinear escalator.

## Abstract
A curvilinear escalator comprises a main frame 1 , which has an arcuate shape in the horizontal plane of projection and is disposed in inclined condition. The main frame has a forwarding way 2a formed on the top surface side thereof, a turning section 2b at one distal end part of the main frame in the longitudinal direction thereof, and a return way 2c on the bottom surface side thereof to thereby construct an endless conveying path 2 . A plurality of steps 3 is continuously disposed in the conveying path and guided therealong, each of the steps being in a sector shape. A pair of step chains 9 is disposed at both sides of the steps on the edge part in the breadthwise direction thereof and along the conveying path 2 . Each step chain comprises joint pieces 9a , each of which is engaged with the end part of a step shaft 3a disposed in each of the steps in the breadthwise direction thereof and link members 9f , which are connected with one end part thereof to one end part of the joint piece to mutually connect the adjacent pieces. A spherical joint 9c is interposed between the step shaft 3a and the link member 9f .
