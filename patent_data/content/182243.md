# Image signal filtering.

## Abstract
An image signal is filtered in one or two dimensions for obtaining an unsharp signal in a detail emphasis process of an image reproduction system. A one dimensional image signal filtering is carried out in one of the main and sub scanning directions so that the first k image signals and the other k image signals out of 2k image signals are respectively summed to obtain first and second sum signal, which are subjected to a cumulus computation to obtain a filtered signal Uâ‚‚ expressed by In this regard, a cumulus computation refers to computa tion expressed by P By filtering the thus obtained 2k 1 one dimensionally fil tered signal U
