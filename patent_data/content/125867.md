# ASSAY SYSTEMS USING MORE THAN ONE ENZYME

## Abstract
This specification discloses methods of detection or measurement of an enzyme or of its specific substrate, and sensors used in such methods. The present invention is con cenred with a multi enzyme system, and the specification discloses, as one aspect of the invention a method of assay in which an electrode poised at a suitable potential is contacted with a system comprising a first enzyme, a cofactor linked with said enzyme and a mediator compound which transfers charge to the electrode from the first enzyme when its electri cal state is changed by reaction of cofactor material. The cofactor may be NAD, NADP both collectively refer red to herein as NAD P CAMP ATP GTP TTP CTP. The specification particularly illustrates a method of assay in which an electrode 1 poised at a suitable potential is contact with a system comprising a first enzyme El a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide compound N linked with said enzyme El and a mediator compound F which transfers charge to the electrode from the first enzyme when its electri cal state is changed by a NAD P NAD P H reaction. The NAD compound may act as a bridge between the said enzyme mediator system and further NAD utilizing enzymes E2.
