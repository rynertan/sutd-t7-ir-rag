## Description
Amide derivatives of phosphonoformic acid, pharmaceutical compositions and methods for combatting virus infections.FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to novel pharmaceutical compositions and to a novel method for selectively combatting viruses, such as herpes viruses, influenza viruses, RNA tumor viruses, etc., which can cause various diseases in animals including man. Such diseases include both common infections and neoplastic diseases, i.e. cancer. In those cases where, the active ingredient in the composition is a novel compound, the invention also comprises the novel compounds per se.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe effects of viruses on bodily functions is the end result of changes occurring at the cellular and subcellular levels. The pathogenic changes at the cellular level are different for different combinations of viruses and host cells. While sonde viruses cause a general destruction killing of certain cells, zither may transform cells to a neoplastic state.Important common viral infections are herpes dermatitis including herpes labialis , herpes keratitis, herpes genitalis, herpes zoster, herpes encephalitis, infectious mononucleosis and cytomegalovirus infections all of which are caused by viruses belonging to the herpesvirus group. Other important viral diseases are influenza A and B which are caused by influenza A and B virus respectively. Another important common viral disease is viral hepatitis and especially hepatitis B virus infections are widely spread.Effective and selective antiviral agents are needed for the treatment of these diseases.Several different viruses of both DNA and RNA type have been shown to cause tumors in animals. The effect of cancerogenic chemicals can on animals result in activation of latent tumor viruses. It is possible that tumor viruses are involved in human tumors. The most likely human cases known today are leucemias, sarcomas, breast carcinomas, Burkitt lymphomas, nasopharyngeal carcinomas and cervical cancers where RNA tumor viruses and herpes viruses are indicated. This makes the search for selective inhibitors of tumorogenic viruses and their functions an important undertaking in the efforts to treat cancer.A most important common feature of the interaction between viruses and cells is the replication or transcription of the specific viral genetic information carried by viral nucleic acids. These viral nucleic acids are of two kinds, deoxyribonucleic acids DNA or ribonucleic acids RNA . The Primary genetic information of the cell is carried by cell DNA. DNA and RNA synthesis involves complex enzymes called DNA and RNA polymerass respectively. The genetic information is transferred to the new nucleic acid from a template nucleic acid.There are four general ways in which these nucleic acids can hs replicated nr transcribedEMI3.1 SEP DNA SEP dependent tb 1. SEP DNA SEP template SEP DNA tb SEP DNA SEP polymerase tb SEP RNA SEP dependent tb 2. SEP RNA SEP temple SEP RNA tb SEP RNA SEP polymerase tb DNA SEP dependent tb 3. SEP DNA SEP temple SEP RNA tb SEP RNA SEP polymerase tb 4. SEP RNA SEP template SEP RNA dependent SEP SEP DNA tb SEP DNA SEP polymerase tb SEP reverse SEP transcriptase tb Processes 1 and 3 are used by cells. DNA viruses such as herpes viruses also use process 1 but the enzyme is different from that of the cell.RNA viruses such as influenza virus use process 2 and the RNA tumor viruses retroviruses can transcribe its RNA to DNA according to process 4.The viral polymerases and the viral nucleic acid syntheses are essential not only for ordinary productive virus infections but also for viral transformation of cells to a neoplastic state leading to cancer tumorogenic function of virus . In te latter case DNA product by DNA viruses such as herpesvirus or transcribed from RNA of RNA tumor viruses and which carries the genetic information for cell transform ation can be integrated into the host cell DNA. This integra tion, or later acts as a consequence of integration such as interaction with cancerogenic chemicals , can then lead to the transformation of the host cell. The implications of inhibiting reverse transcriptase for cell transformation are also described in U.S. patent 3,979,511.Since the viral polymerases in most cases differ from the cellular ones these viral enzymes and viral nucleic acid syntheses are good targets for specific antiviral chemotherapy including chemotherapy of cancer causea oy viruses.It should be noted that many compounds presently used for chemotherapy of cancer are inhibitors of nucleic acid synthesis. It is therefore possible that antiviral comoounds which are also inhibitors of nucleic acid synthesis can affect tumor cells directly. There is a need for an effective arl viral agent preferably having a selective inhibiting effect on a specific viral function of the virus to be combatted.It is, therefore, a general object of the present invention to provide a novel method for combatting virus infections using an antiviral agent which exerts a selective inhibiting effect on viral functions but which exerts only a negligible inhibiting effect on functions of the host cells. THE INVENTION It has been found according to the present invention that the compounds of the formulaEMI4.1 wherein R1 and R2, which are the same or different, each is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl groups containing 1 6 carbon atoms cycloalkyl groups containing 3 6 carbon atoms cycloalkyl alkyl groups containing 4 6 carbon atoms phenyl and benzyl, and wherein R4 and R5 are the same or different, and each are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl groups containing 1 6 carbon atoms, cycloalkyl groups containing 4 5 carbon atoms, phenyl, and benzyl or R4 and R5 together with the nitrogen atom may form a pyrrolidine or piperidine ring and physio logically acceptable salts thereof, inhibit certain viral functions including tumorogenic functions and the multiplication of viruses. It is understood that the reference to physiologically acceptable salts of the comoounds of the formula I in the present specification and claims relates only to such compounds which 3n Scrm salts. Compounds wherein at least one of R1 and R2 is hydrogen can form salts. Compound her0in both R1 and R2 are different from hydrogen do not form salts. Since the compounds of the formula I, when R1 and R2 are different, contain an asymmetric center, they exist in the form of optically active forms, and can be resolved into their optical antipodes by known methods.In this specification, the compounds of the invention are named as derivatives of the compound hydroxycarbonylphosphonic acid, which compound also is known under the name phosphonoformic acid.The compounds of the formula I and physiologically acceptable salts thereof are useful in therapeutic and or prophylactic treatment of viral diseases and may be useful in therapeutic and or prophylactic treatment of cancer caused by viruses.PRIOR ARTVarious carbamoylphosphonates are described in for exampleUS Patent Nos. 2 909 558, 3 649 102, 3 929 446, 3 952 074, 3 997 544 and in Chemical Abstracts Vol. 50, 793 1956 and Vol. 45, 542 1951 .

Thus for examples, Ca, Ba, Zn, Mg and Mn salts of the active substances can be prepared from sodium salts thereof.The metal ion of a metal salt of the active substances can be exchanged by hydrogen ions, other metal ions, ammonium ion and ammonium ions substituied by one cr more organic radicals by using a catIon exchanger as shown in the following examples.Examples of other useful salts which can be prepared in this way are the salts of the formulaEMI19.1 in which formula n is 1 or 2 and X is a salt forming component such as NH3, CH3NH2, C2H5NH2 C3H7NH2, C4H9NH2,C5H11NH2, C6H13NH2, CH3 2NH, C3H7 2NH, C4H9 2NH, C5H11 2NH, C6H13 2NH, CH3 3N, C2H5 3N, C3H7 3N, C4H9 3N, C5H11 3N, C6H13 3N, C6H5CH2NH2, HOCH2CH2NH2, HOCH2CH2 2NH, HOCH2CH2 3N, C2H5NH CH2CH2OH , C2H5N CH2CH2OH 2, HOH2C 3CNH2 andEMI19.2 Further examples of other useful salts which can be prepared by the ion exchange technique are quaternary ammonium salts of the active substances i.e. salts in which the hydrogens in the active substances structural formula I have been substituted with quaternary ammonium ions such as CH3 4N, C2H5 4N, C3H7 4N, C4H9 4N, C5H11 4N, C6H13 4N and C2H 5N CH2CH20H 3 Lipophilic salts of this type can also be prepared by mixing a salt of the active substance with a quaternary ammonium salt in water and extracting out the resulting quaternary ammonium salt of the active substances with an organic solvent such as dichloromethane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and methyl isobutyl ketone. The compounds utilized within the invention may be formulated for use in human and veterinary medicine for therapeutic and prophylactic use. The compounds may be used in the form of a physiologically acceptable salt. Suitable salts are e.g. amine salts, e.g. dimethylamine and triethylamine salt, ammonium salt, tetrabutylammonium salt, cyclohexylamine salt, dicyclohexylamine salt and metal salts, e.g. mono and disodium salt, mono and dipotassium salt, magnesium salt, calcium salt and zinc salt.The compounds utilized within the invention are particularly useful for systemic treatment of virus infections, by oral administration or by injection.In comparison with phosphonoformic acid, they are generally more stable in acid solutions, and are thus less readily decomposed in the stomach.In clinical practice the compounds will normally be administered topically, orally, intranasally, by injection or by inhalation in the form of a pharmaceutIcal prepardtion comprising the active ingredient in the form of the original compound or optionally in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which may be a solid, semisolid or liquid diluent or an ingestible capsule, and such preparations comprise a further aspect of the invention The compound may also be used without carrier material. As examples of pharmaceutical preparations may be mentioned tablets, drops such as nasal and eye drops, preparations for topical application such as ointments, jellies, creams and suspensions, aerosols for inhalation, nasal spray, liposomes etc.Usually the active substance will comprise between 0.05 and 99, or between 0.1 and 99 by weight of the preparation, for examDle between 0.5 and 20 for preparations intended for injection and between 0.1 and 50 for prenarations intended for oral administration. To produce pharmaceutical preparations in the form of dosage units for oral application containing a compound of the invention the active ingredient may be mixed with a sblid, pulverulent carrier, for example lactose, saccharose, sorbitol, mannitol, a starch such as potato starch, corn starch, amylopectin, laminaria powder or citrus pulp powder, a cellulose derivative or gelatine and also may include lubricants such as magnesium or calcium stearate or a Carbowax or other polyethylene glycol waxes and compressed to form tablets or cores for dragées. If dragées are required, the cores may be coated for example with concentrated sugar solutions which may contain gum arabic, talc and or titanium dioxide, or alternatively with a film forming agent dissolved in easily volatile organic solvents or mixtures of organic solvents. Dyestuffs can be added to these coatings, for example, to distinguish between different contents of active substance. For the preparation of soft gelatine capsules consisting of gelatine and, for example, glycerol as a plasticizer, or similar closed capsules, the active substance may be admixed with a Carbowax or a suitable oil as e.g. sesam oil, olive oil, or arachis oil.Hard gelatine capsules may contain granulates of the active substance with solid, pulverulent carriers such as lactose, saccharose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches for example potato starch, corn starch or amylopectin , cellulose derivatives or gelatine, and may also include magnesium stearate or stearic acid as lubricants.By using several layers of the active drug, separated by slowly dissolving coatings sustained release tablets are obtained. Another way of preparing sustained release tablets is to divide the dose of the active drug into granules with coatings of different thickness and comDress the granules into tablets together with the carrier substance. The active substance can also be incorporated in slowly dissply ing tablets maze for instance of fat and wax substances Dr evenly distributed in a tablet of an insoluble substance such as a physiologically inert plastic substance.In order to obtain dosage units of oral preparations tablets, capsules, etc. which are designed so as to prevent release of and possible decomposition of the active substance in the gastric juice, the tablets, dragées etc.may be enteric coated, that is provided with a layer of a gastric juice resistant enteric film or coating having such properties that it is not dissolved at the acidic pH in the gastric juice. Thus, the active substance will not be released until the preparation reaches the intestines.As examples of such known enteric coatings may be mentioned cellulose acetate phtalate, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phtalates such as those sold under the trade names HP 55 and HP 50, and EudragittL and EudragiteS. Effervescent powders are prepared by mixing the active ingredient with non toxic carbonates or hydrogen carbonates of e.g. sodium, potassium or calcium, such as calcium carbonate, potassium carbonate and potassium hydrogen carbonate, solid, non toxic acids such as ta ariz acid, ascorbic acid, and citric acid, and for example aroma.Liquid preparations for oral application may be in the form of elixirs, syrups or suspensions, for example solutions containing from about 0.1 to 20 by weight of active substance, sugar and a mixture of ethanol, water, glycerol, propylene glycol and optionally aroma, saccharine and or carboxymethylcellulose as a dispersing agent.For parenteral application by injection preparations may comprise an aqueous solution of a water soluble pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the active acids according to the invention, desirably in a concentration of 0.5 10 , ana optionally also a stabilizing agent and or suffer substances in aqueous solution. Dosa units of the solution may advantageously be enclosed in ampoules.For topical application, especially for the treatment of herpesvirus infections on skin, genitals and in mouth and eyes the preparations are suitably in the form of a solution, ointment, gel, suspension, cream or the like. The amount of active substance may vary, for example between 0.05 20 by weight of the preparation. Such preparations for topical application may be prepared in known manner by mixing the active substance with known carrier materials such as isopropanol, glycerol, paraffine, stearyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, etc. The pharmaceutically acceptable carrier may also include a known chemical absorption promoter. Examples of absorption promoters are e.g. dimethylacetamide U S Pat. No. 3,472,931 , trichloroethanol or trifluroethanol U S Pat. No. 3,891,757 , certain alcohols and mixtures thereof British Pat. No. 1,001,949 .A carrier material for topical application to unbroken skin is also described in the British patent specification No. 1,464,975, which discloses a carrier material consisting of a solvent comprising 40 70 v v isopropanol and 0 60 v v glycerol, the balance, if any, being an inert constituent or a diluent not exceeding 40 of the total volume of solvent. The dosage at which the active ingredients are administered may vary within a wide range and will depend on various factors such as for example the severity of the infection, the age of the patient, etc. and may have to be individually adjusted. As a possible range for the amount of the active substance which may be administered per day may be mentioned from about 0.1 mg to about 2000 mg or from about 1 mg to about 2000 mg, or preferably from 1 mg to about 2000 mg for topical administration, from 50 mg to about 2000 mg or from Inn to Do non t n mg for oral administration end from 1O me to about 2u O mg or from 50 to about 500 mg for lnject on. In severe cases It may be necessary to increase these doses 5 fold to 10 fold. In less severe cases it may be sufficient to use up to 500 or 1000 mg.The pharmaceutical composistions containing the active ingredients may suitably be formulated so that they provide doses within these ranges either as single dosage units or as multiple dosage units and are preferably provided as sterile preparations.Thus, it has been found according to the invention that the above compounds, and the physiologically acceptable salts thereof can be used to selectively inhibit the multiplication of viruses and the compounds and physiologically acceptable salts thereof are therefore useful in therapeutic and or prophylactic treatment of virus infections and neoplastic diseases, as described above.Preparation of the active substancesReferences to meaning given above for R1, R2, R4 and P as used below refers to the definitions given in formula I.Hydroxycarbamoylphosphonic acid di esters are prepared by known methods.

The test compound 10 ,umol was dissolved in 0.5 ml saline and injected intraperitoneally.Two mice kept in one cage for metabolization experiment were used for each compound. The urine obtained from the two mice on day 1, 2 and 3 after the injections was collected. The urine was diluted with Tris HCl buffer pH 7.9 to a constant volume of 1 ml. This volume was then diluted 1 500, 1 5000 and 1 50000 with the same buffer and assayed for phosphonoformic acid activity on cell free influenza polymerase. The assay mixture which incudes Mn2 and assay conditions are described by Bishop, Obijeski and Simpson, 3. Virol. 6, 66 1971 . Phosfonoformic acid in diluted urine gave 50 inhibition at 0.5 pM in this assay and was used as a standard to estimate the amount of phosphonoformic acid activity formed in the urine from compounds of the invention.EMI52.1 tb SEP Test SEP compound SEP Code SEP Recovered SEP phosphonoformic SEP acid tb SEP activity SEP in SEP urine tb SEP umol SEP phosphonoformic SEP acid tb SEP Day SEP 1 SEP Day SEP 2 SEP Day SEP 3 tb SEP OO tb NaO C N C2H5 2 SEP 0.63 SEP 0.36 SEP cO.O1 tb SEP L tb SEP ONa SEP VIS SEP 232 tb SEP OO tb NaO 0 C Na SEP reference SEP 1.25 SEP 0.13 SEP cO.O1 tb SEP ONa tb Discussing of test resultsAs seen in test I compounds of the invention are active on herpes virus and influenza virus multiplication in cells.According to the stability test II, compounds of the invention are more stable than trisodium phosphonoformate in 0.1 Fl aqueous HC1, which is a model for stability in gastric juice, and the compounds of the invention should therefore be more suitable for oral administrations than phosphonoformic acid and physiologically acceptable salts thereof. The test cn in vivo metabolism III shows that compounds of the invention are metabolized to phosphonoformic acid measured as phosphonoformic acid activity on influenza polymerase. It is also shown in test III that compounds according to the invention can give such an active metabolite in the urine of mice over a longer time period than trisodi um phosphonoformate. Thus compounds of the invention have a prolonged activity in comparison with phosphonoform acid and its physiologically acceptable salts.In conclusion compounds of the invention have antiviral effects on herpes and influenza viruses. Furthernore compounds of the invention can be bio transformed to phosphonoformic acid or ionized forms thereof which have strong activities against viral functions and virus multiplication.
