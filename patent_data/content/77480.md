# Air nozzle apparatus for use in drawing glass fibers.

## Abstract
An air nozzle apparatus 24 for use in directing air flow against the undersurface of an orifice plate of a glass fiber drawing forehearth 2 , having an air introducing section 32 having a manifold 30 formed with at least one air supply port 28 , and an air nozzle section 36 formed with a plurality of nozzle channels 34 communicating with the manifold 30 . The air nozzle section has a plurality of nozzle ribs 38 of substantially the same shape each having opposed side surfaces 40, 42 and opposed end edge portions. The plurality of nozzle ribs is arranged to have their side surfaces located in adjacent relationship to provide a nozzle block 39 . Each nozzle rib 38 is formed on at least one of the opposed side surfaces 40, 42 with a longitudinal ly extending recess 44, 46 which defines one of the plurality of nozzle channels 34 between the adjacent nozzle ribs 38 .
