# Billet control method in a horizontal continuous casting system.

## Abstract
A method for controlling the billet pushing back length for a horizontal continuous casting system is disclosed wherein, for allowing stable formation of the billet shell, the billet is pushed or forced back towards the mold during the transient stop or halt cycle of the intermittent billet extracting process. The pushing or forcing back pressure executed by the pinch rolls is controlled for each extracting cycle in order that the billet is pushed or forced back towards the mold a preset length.
