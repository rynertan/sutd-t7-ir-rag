# Method of treating a workpiece with an electron beam.

## Abstract
In electron beam welding, the vacuum chamber 10 in which a workpiece 18 is located is hermetically connected to a vacuum chamber 39 containing the electron beam gun 26 . The chamber 10 is kept at a vacuum of 1 x 10 ⁴ Torr while the chamber 39 is at a vacuum of 1 x 10 ⁵ to 1 x 10 ⁶ Torr. In order to minimize discharge phenomena caused by gas molecules generated at the workpiece during the welding, the distance between the electron beam gun and the surface of the workpiece is greater than the main free path of these gas molecules e.g. 1.85 m. Two focussing coils 42,48 are arranged to prevent the expansion of the electron beams.
