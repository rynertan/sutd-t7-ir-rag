# Cubic boron nitride preparation.

## Abstract
A deposit of cubic boron nitride is placed on a substrate by an activated reactive evaporation method. The method includes supporting and heating a substrate in vacuum evaporating metal vapors into a zone between the substrate and the metals alloy source from a metals alloy source con sisting essentially of at least 60 percent by weight to balance of boron with from 2 to 12 percent by weight of aluminum and at least 0.2 to 24 percent by weight of at least one of cobalt, nickel, manganese, or other aluminide forming element introducing ammonia gas into the zone and generating an electrical field in the zone for ionizing the metal vapors and gas atoms in the zone. In the method the substrate generally is heated to a temperature of at least 300 C with preferred subs trate temperatures between about 500 C. and 1100 C., the ammonia gas pressure preferably is about 1 x 10 ⁴ torr to 8 x 10 ³ torr, and a plasma activation in the zone desirably may be provided by employing a deflection electrode maintained at a positive voltage potential and positioned between the subs trate and the source of evaporating metal vapors.
