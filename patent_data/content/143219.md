## Abstract
A centralizer for a well casing, and the method of producing a centralizer, for assembly in the field. The cen tralizer comprises two collars and a plurality of spring bows, with a bow receiving section in each collar for each bow. Aligned channels are formed in the collar defining a pas sage for receiving a bow end, and each bow end has a hat section for positioning in the aligned channels. After a bow end is inserted in a collar passage, one of the channels is compressed into the bow hat section to lock the bow in place.
