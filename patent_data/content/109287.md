# COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS

## Abstract
A communication system comprises a plurality of remote stations 2 serially connected in a communication loop 10 to a control station 8 . Communication of intelligence to and from the remote stations 2 and to and from the control station 8 is by way of high frequency bits which are introduced serial ly and circulate through the loop 10 . An inoperative remote station 2 is bypassed by introducing into the station to be by passed a DC signal of controlled magnitude duration and po larity, which, by means of a by pass module 4 , disconnects the station from the communication loop 10 while main taining the integrity of the loop.
