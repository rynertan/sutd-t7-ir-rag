In order to place tension on the ribbon 16 which is stored in the cartridge 12, 14 , preferably in a stuffed condition, a removable clip 32 is provided having a cooperating finger 34 and convex surface 36 . The ribbon is thus pinched so as to produce a drag force on the ribbon 16 at a location 30 which is adjacent the print point 22 and spaced from the cartridge 12,14 by a substan tial length of the flexible leader 18 .
