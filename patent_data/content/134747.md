# Apparatus and method for feeding strip material for application to a drum.

## Abstract
An apparatus 10 and method wherein strip material 62 is clamped to a shuttle finger 46 slidably mounted in a shuttle casing 44 which in turn is slidably mounted on a strip applier frame 14 . The shuttle casing 44 and shuttle finger 46 are movable simultaneously from a retracted first position to a second position with the end of the shuttle casing 44 adjacent an applicator roll 28 . The shuttle finger 46 is then movable by itself from the second position to a third position for transferring a tongue portion 124 of the strip 62 onto the applicator roll 28 . The tongue portion 124 may then be elevated into clamping engagement with the drum 12 and the strip 62 released from the shuttle finger 46 . The shuttle casing 44 and shuttle finger 46 may then be returned to the first position, the drum 12 rotated a predetermined amount to partially wrap the strip 62 around the drum 12 and the strip 62 cut at a predetermined location whereupon the drum 12 is rotated to fully wrap the strip of flexible material 62 around the drum 12 . Guide members 90 at the front edges of the feed path are retractable to permit movement of the shuttle casing 44 into close proximity with the applicator roll 28 . Also a cycle reset clamping assembly 112 is provided for clamping a portion of the strip of flexible material 62 to the applicator roll 28 to allow the shuttle casing 44 to move to the retracted position for cutting of the strip of flexible material 62 in that position when the applicator roll 28 is not elevated into contact with the drum 12 .
