# Process for the production of formates.

## Abstract
An alkyl ester of formic acid is prepared by reacting carbon monoxide with an alcohol in the presence, as catalyst, of a a guanidine or b an amidine and an epoxide. The amidine or guanidine structure can be cyclic. The process can be operated in the liquid phase at pressures from 20 to 120 bars and temperatures from 40 to 150 C with excess carbon monoxide over that required for conversion of the alcohol to the formate ester.
