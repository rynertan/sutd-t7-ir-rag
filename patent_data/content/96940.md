# X ray examination apparatus.

## Abstract
In an X ray BV TV apparatus, for displaying images with a small contrast difference, the beam current of the television camera tube included therein can be temporarily adjusted to an increased value, as a result of which these images can be displayed with an increased signal to noise ratio. The televi sion camera can then be changed over preferably automatical ly between this form of image production and the usual pro duction of fluoroscopic images.
