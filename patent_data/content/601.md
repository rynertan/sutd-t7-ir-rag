# Process for the preparation of a low molecular weight acrylate copolymer, and a liquid coating composition having a high solids content based on the acrylate copolymer thus obtained.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of an acrylate copolymer having a number average molecular weight of 400 2000 by polymerization of a monomer mixture consisting of 35 60 mole of styrene and or Î± methyl styrene, 20 60 mole of acrylic acid and or methacrylic acid and 0 30 mole of one or more other monovinyl compounds in the presence of a 2 to 8 carbon atoms containing mercaptomonocarboxylic acid or mercaptodicarboxylic acid as chain length regulator in an amount of 0.05 to 0.2 moles per mole of the monomeric compounds, after which the resulting reaction product is brought into reaction with a glycidyl ester of a monocarboxylic acid. The invention also relates to a liquid coating composition having a solids content of at least 60 by weight based on the acrylate copolymer thus prepared and a curing agent.
