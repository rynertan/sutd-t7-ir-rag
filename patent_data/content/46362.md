# Corrosion resistant coated substrates.

## Abstract
The substrates, such as this interior surfaces of chimney liners, flue ducts and scrubbers, are rendered corrosion resis tant by application of a multilayer coating. The multi layer coat ing comprises a primer layer of thermosetting polymer, an in termediate layer comprising a thermosetting polymer and sili ceous filler, a further intermediate layer of a thermo setting po lymer and a non siliceous filler, and an outer layer of a fluoro elastomer and a non siliceous filler. The improvement over the multi layer coating of Euro pean Patent Application Publication 10853 is in the further in termediate layer, which provides significantly enhanced chemi cal resistance and thermal stability.
