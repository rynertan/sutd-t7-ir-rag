# Ceramic envelope device for high pressure discharge lamp.

## Abstract
A ceramic envelope device for a high pressure metal vapor discharge lamp, has a translucent ceramic tube 6 , a pair of electrically conducting end caps 14 closing opposite ends of the ceramic tube, and a pair of opposed discharge electrodes 16 each of which is supported at its one end by the corresponding end cap 14 such that the other end of the electrode protrudes from the inner surface of the corres ponding end cap in a longitudinally inward direction of the ceramic tube. Each of the end caps is covered at its inner surface with an electrical insulator 20 . To avoid arc back between the electrode and the end cap and also corrosion of the central portion of the end cap, the electrical insulator has a protruding portion 22 surrounding a part of the corres ponding electrode which protrudes from a radially central portion of the inner surface of the corresponding end cap, The surrounded part of the corresponding electrode is radially spaced from the protruding portion of the electrical insulator.
