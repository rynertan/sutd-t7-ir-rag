One 1,3,6,12,18 of the two neighbouring supporting faces may serve to support the posterior of the occupant and the other 2,4,7,11,19 to support the calf. Alternatively one 3 serves to support the back and the other 4 to support the posterior. The supporting faces comprise a forwardly inclined seat cushion and a calf cushion forming a mutual angle of at least 90 . The supporting faces may be arranged at a distance from each other and with free space between these. They may be mechanically linked with each other. A set of two posterior 6 supports, a common calf support 7 and a common table 10 is provided.
