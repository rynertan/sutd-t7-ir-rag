# ZINC BASED PAINTS EMPLOYING A MIXTURE OF ETHER ALCOHOLS AS LIQUID ORGANIC VEHICLES

## Abstract
A solvent mix can be used to improve the protection offered by zinc based paints. The improved zinc based paint affords corrosion protection as an additional factor for the enhancement of coating protection. The solvent mix reacts with zinc to provide the improved protection effect.
