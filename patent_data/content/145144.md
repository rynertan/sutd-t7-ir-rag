# Spray pattern analyzer.

## Abstract
A spray pattern analyzer for use in analyzing spray patterns formed by spray nozzles which are attached to an agricultural spray applicator boom. This analyzer includes a corrugated collector tray mounted on a cart. The cart has wheels for moving the collector tray through the spray pattern. The collector tray is designed so as to receive collector test tubes each being longitudinally aligned with the troughs of the collector tray. When the troughs are partially filled with spray, the collector tray is tilted so that the spray will flow into the test tubes to provide a visual indication of the pattern. The collector tray is constructed in segments to allow the collector tray to be collapsed. Further, the cart is constructed to permit an adjustment of the height of the collector tray from the surface upon which the cart rests.
