## Description
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR COMPENSATING FOR COSINE IRRADIANCY VARIATIONS IN AN OPTICAL SYSTEM This invention relates generally to a full frame copying device and, more particularly to an improved optical system adapted to provide a uniform irradiance at an image plane through a multi magnification range. In electrophotographic copiers, the areas of a charged photoconductive surface,which are irradiated by a light image, are discharged, the degree of discharge dependent upon the intensity irradiance of the impinging light rays. It is, therefore, desirable that the light ray intensity vary only due to the reflectance characteristics of the original document being copied rather than due to changes introduced by the imaging components. Stated in another manner, the optimum system would be one providing uniform photoconductor irradiance given a uniformly reflecting document. Of the factors affecting relative irradiance at an imaging plane, the most significant is the cosine cos variation wherein the irradiance at an image plane is proportional to the cos4 of the angle between the lens axis and the field beam. Thus, even if an object plane is uniformly illuminated, photoconductor irradiance decreases as radial distance from the system optical axis increases. Various approaches have been devised to compensate for this effect. Typically, in slit scanning systems, a sheet of opaque material having a butterfly slit formed thereon is employed with the irradiance profile.Other slit scanning systems utilize Åa variable density 4 filter in the optical path whose transmissiveness varies inversely to the cos Such a device is described in IBM Technical Disclosure, Vol. 14, No. 11 .april 4 1972 . In addition to the cos variation, other circularly symmetrical non uniformities, such as lens exit pupil distortion, lens transmission and vignetting,affect the relative irradiance at the imaging plane. In full frame imaging systems wherein an entire document is 4 typically illuminated by flash illumination, efforts to compensate for cos light falloff have emphasized locating light sources in such a way that the document edges are illuminated to a greater degree than central areas. Two such systems are disclosed in U. S. patents 3,669,538 Fowler and 3,777,135 Rees .These compensation techniques are fairly effective for relatively 4 small half field angles P 200 but as this field angle increases, the cos falloff becomes steeper and other circularly symmetric non uniformities Within the optical system contribute still further to illumination nonuniformity at the image plane. Also, the increased edge illumination produced by these systems may not be entirely suitable for corner registered document systems. These non uniformities include lens transmission variations and lens exit pupil distortion. The cumulative effect of these non uniformities, combined with the cos 4 dropoff, result in often severe problems in obtaining uniform exposure at the photoconductor.In addition, if these systems provide a magnification generally reduction option, a variation of 4 the field angles hence, cos variation occurs with magnification changes, and it has not been possible to maintain the desired image plane illumination through all the reduction positions. This problem is further accentuated in systems in which the.document to be copied is edge or corner registered due to the assymetrical aspect of the field. There is therefore required a means to provide uniform imaging of a document in a full frame, multi magnification copying system by compensating for the effects of cos4 and other variations through all magnification positions assumed by the projection lens. This object is accomplished by positioning a variable density filter at suitable distance from a projection lens, the filter having a radiallyvarying, circularly symmetric density which attenuates light passing therethrough so as to provide an irradiance profile at the imaging plane compensates for the lens cos4 falloff, lens pupil distortion, lens transmission and vignetting. This filter will hereinafter be designated as a relative illumination filter. The filter center is fixed in position on the lens optical axis and maintains this position relative to the lens in any magnification location assumed by the lens. According to one aspect of the invention, by maintaining the same relative lens to filter spacing, uniform irradiance at the image plane is maintained throughout the reduction range. The present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a view of an optical system for a full frame copier with the relative illumination filter of the present invention located in the optical path Figure 2 is a sketch illustrating exit pupil distortion of the lens shown in Figure 1 when the lens is viewed from an extreme angle at the edges of a platen Figure 3 is a graph which illustrates the relative illumination 4 falloff at a photoconductive image plane due to the effects of cos alone as compared with cos4 combined with other system non uniformities Figure 4 is a graph illustrating the transmission profile of the filter of Figure 1 Figures 5a and 5b are top and cross sectional views of the filter shown in Figure 1 Figure 6 is a graph illustrating relative illumination at a 4 photoconductor for a system corrected only for cos as compared to a system using the relative illumination filter of the invention Figure 7 is a graph illustrating the relative illumination variation with the filter placed at a design location with respect to the lens as compared to a second optimum locations and Figure 8 is a schematic view of one embodiment of the lens and filter of Figure 1 at unity magnification and reduction positions. Referring now to Figure 1, there is shown a full frame exposure optical system which utilizes a relative illumination RI filter constructed and positioned according to the principles of the present invention. Generally, a completely endosed housing 10 has a first pair of opposing side walls 12, 14 and a second pair of opposing side walls 16, 18. An upper, or top,wall 20 includes a rectangular aperture 22 which, at the center thereof, accommodates a glass platen 24 forming the object plane. The lower, or bottom, wall 30 has an aperture 32 therein which accommodates lens 34. Relative illumination RI filter 36 is fixedly mounted above lens 34 by a mounting bracket 38 with the center of the filter on lens optical axisZ and the XY plane of the filter perpendicular to the axis. Filter 36 is a variable density filter having a transmission profile that increases with radial displacement from the optical axis as described in greater detail below. An image plane 38,which may, for example, be a photoconductive sheet to which a charge has been applied, is positioned for exposure to light reflected from a document not shown on platen 24, transmitted through filter 36 and projected by lens 34. The optimum spacing between the filter and lens depends upon actual system requirements and can be determined by design techniques known to those skilled in the art. If desired, the filter can be incorporated as part of the lens. The optical system also includes a flash illumination source 39 which may be a periodically pulsed xenon lamp. The interior of the housing 10 is preferentially coated with a substantially diffusely reflecting material. When lamp 39 is flashed, a substantially uniform illumination of the document placed on the platen is obtained.The light reflected by the document passes through filter 36 which attenuates the amount of light passing through in accordance with its transmission profile.The compensated light profile is projected through lens 34 and falls upon plane 38 selectively discharging the sheet and resulting in formation of a latent electrostatic image thereon. The lens filter combination is assumed to be at unity 1 1 magnification. In order to understand the problems involved in obtaining image plane uniformity in an optical system as shown in Figure 1, a more detailed discussion of the factors contributing to non uniformitv follows. 4 As previously mentioned, the most severe problem is the cos illumination falloff. Filters are known which provide compensation by having a maximum density at the center and having density decrease in accordance 4 with the cos curve until 100 transmission is obtained at the edge of field. These filters are effective at short radial distances from the optical axis but their effectiveness decreases as the outer limits of field angle are approached. The reason for this is that the relative illumination in the image plane is governed by at least two other factors. These effects are shown in the following formula EMI4.1 where Te is the transmission of the lens as a function of lens half angle e commat As is the area of the exit pupil at a given angle e as projected onto the axial exit pupil plane and AA is the area of the exit pupil on axis. The factor As AA is referred to as the pupil distortion function. This effect is due to the effective change in shape and position of the exit pupil when viewed at various field angles through the lens elements between the lens aperture and the image plane.This pupil distortion is a function of the lens design and generally worsens with increasing field angle. Figure 2 shows the exit pupil of lens 34 of Figure 1 when viewed at two field positions on axis dotted and 360 in the x direction solid . Note that the center of the exit pupil has shifted towards the direction of view and the pupil has gone from a circular pupil to an ellipse with its minor axis coinciding with the x axis. The effect of this pupil distortion on lens transmission can be seen in the graph in Figure 3 which plots relative illumination at the image plane at a nominalized axial 4 4 distance from the lens for the cases of cos fall off only curve 40 and cos plus lens introduced non uniformities curve 40A .The increasing difference between the curves at the outer field angles represents the additional decrease of illumination at the outer portions of a projected image. The filter of the present invention has been designed to provide compensation for these cumulative effects on image plane non uniformity and a specific example is given in the following description A filter 36 was designed to provide the optical system of Figure 1 with an overall relative illumination variation of 2 at the image plane.The optical system as the following characteristics Field angle range 00 to 400 Lens 34 i 10, 150mm focal length xl to x0.647 magnification Lens exit pupil to image plane distance 312mm Filter 36 to exit pupil distance 78mm The relative illumination at the image plane is first determined in the absence of a filter and the filter design is then calculated by a trial and error iterative process. More specifically, a series of equations is derived which describes the lens exit pupil change at a number of field angle positions. Using these equations, light ray bundles which can pass through each area are calculated thus defining relative illumination at the image plane for these points. A given level of illumination is pre defined at the desired uniform level.A filter transmission profile is constructed by an iterative process which consists of calculating optimum points for the filter to intercept the light bundles emerging from the respective pupil areas as well as optimum density to achieve the desired illumination level. From this process, several annular rings of varying density are defined for the filter which form the core of the transmission profile. An interpolation is then made between these transmission values to generate the complete filter profile shown in Figure 4. Referring now to Figure 4, profile 41 can be characterized as generally increasing as radial distance from filter center increases but with portions of the profile having distinctive characteristics. Segment 41a at 30 transmission is relatively flat segment 41b rises in slightly irregular fashion segment 41c levels off and then rises abruptly at transition point 41d radial distance 54 mm to final segment 41e which is a flat segment representing 100 transmission to the outer edge of the filter. Note that the transmission values are normalized to the transmission of the filter substrate material so that the relative transmission of the substrste material becomes 100 . Profile 41 is obtained by forming the filter shown in Figure Sa, Sb.Referring to these figures, filter 36 includes a transparent member such as a circular glass plate having a diameter of 150 mm. The plate has a central circular coated area 42 of radius RI and is surrounded by transparent annular ring 44 within outer radius of R2. Coating 42 is a thin layer of nichrome which is formed by vacuum deposition on the surface of plate 43. The density of coating 42 is maximum in a central region 45, decreases through region 46, levels off in region 48 and wends abruptly at transition edge 50. The thickness of coating 42 will vary from hundreds of microns in central area 45 down to tens of microns in region 48. In comparing the filter 36 of Figure 5 with the transmission profile 41 of Figure 4 it is evident that region 45, 46, 48, 50 and 44 correspond to segments 41a through 41d of profile 41 and to clear segment 41e respectively. Figure 6 illustrates the improved relative illumination of the image plane using the above described filter curve 68 and as compared to a 4 lens corrected only for cos dropoff curve 70 . The effect of profile areas 41a, 41b is to maintain uniform illumination up to segment 68a which corresponds to the flattening out of the transmission profile at segment 41c. At this point, the relative illumination rises, slightly representing an overcorrection. The next rise, representing a second overcorrection, is at transition segment 68b corresponding to 41d of profile 41 where effective transmission sharply rises to 100 . Following this point, the relative illumination begins to drop even though the beam is being completely transmitted through clear glass since the effects of cos4 and lens distortion are even greater. The overcorrection segments are considered important elements of the invention since they maintain the relative illumination to within the desired 2 . A particular advantageous feature of the invention is the abrupt termination of the coating 42 at transition point 50 shown in Figure 5b . In vacuum deposition techniques wherein layers of metal such as nichrome and chrome are deposited on substrates, the requirements for increasing transmission require that the coating be made extremely thin, in the order of several microns. Such coatings are very difficult to achieve when making filters in production quantities. According to the present invention, the filter transmission near the coating edge 50 is kept relatively low keeping the coating material as thick as possible thereby making it easier to deposit the metal to the desired thickness. Another problem is encountered in the fabrication of filters in production quantities. No matter what technique is used in mass producing filters vacuum deposition, photographic, etc. there will be some deviation from the desired filter transmission profile due to process variability. This will result in increased variation in the relative illumination at the image plane. Either extremely tight controls must be exercised in the production process resulting in increased cost or some method of accounting for these variations must be accomplished. According to another aspect of the invention, it was discovered that at least some of the illumination variation caused by these errors could be partially corrected by adjusting the position of the filter along the optical axis.For example, if filter 36 in Figure 1 were fabricated with the basic shape of the radial transmission curve correct but all of the transmission values 3 absolute high and the filterwereplaced at the nominal design position 78 mm from lens exit pupil the resultant illumination profile in the image plane assuming perfect illumination in the object plane would be as illustrated in Flgure 7. There would be a resultant total maximum variation in illumination at the image plane of 996 as shown by plot 80. This can be partially compensated by adjusting the filter to a new position N 2mm farther from the lens exit pupil.This reduces the illumination variation to 6 , as shown by plot 82. Similarly, if tfie transmission of the filter is 5 3 low, a total illumination variation of E 11 is reduced to around 3 by shifting the filter around 3mm doser to the exit pupil. The curves shown represent a system designed for maximum field angle of 36 . Figure 8 is a schematic view of lens 34 and filter 36 in a unity magnification and reduction position. It is assumed that the system shown inFigure 1 requires continuously variable optical magnification over a given range while maintaining a constant total optical conjugate. The system is also one in which doquments are corner registered. Lens 34 is assumed to be a zoom lens whose focal length can be continuously varied. As shown inFigure 8, at position 90, the lens filter assembly are at unity magnification with the center of each element lying on optical axis Z. When operating in a reduction mode, the assembly by means not shown is moved to position 92 to adjust the object and image conjugates with the focal length of lens 34 undergoing simultaneous changes to retain proper focusing. The center of the lens filter assembly now lies on optical axis Z .It is seen that the filter remains symmetrical with the changing lens optical axis during lens translation and therefore provides continuous and uniform compensation at all magnification positions while maintaining corner registration C C . The above principles will be valid for situations requiring enlargement as well. For example, if a document is to be magnified at a 1.5x ratiosslens 34 filter 36 would be translated away from the photoreceptor to a new position not shown and the focal length adjusted accordingly. Although the filter of the invention has been shown in connection with the specific embodiment of Figure 1, it may be practised in other environments. For example, alternate optical systems may change magnification by varying total conjugate e. g. moving object and or image planes, addition of folding mirrors. Edge, rather than corner registration, may be employed. While relatively uniform illumination of the object plane has been described, filter 36 could be designed to compensate for a nonuniform platen illumination provided the non uniformity is circularly symmetric about the lens axis at all magnifications used. Although the filter has been shown mounted on the object side of the lens, it could also be mounted on the image side. Finally, although the description has described the use of the filter in relatively wide field angle situations where the illumination falloff problems are most severe, the filter is also suitable for use in systems having smaller field angle requirements.
