# Method and arrangement at a transformer.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method and to an arrange ment for controlling the respective conduction times of two directionally opposed electrical devices 9, 10 which are mutually connected in parallel and permit current to pass therethrough solely in one direction, and which also permit current I₂ to pass through the primary winding 2 of a trans former during a respective half period of an A.C. voltage U₁ applied to the primary winding, this control being effected so that the magnetizing current through the transformer can be advantageously minimized and or held beneath a given limit value when an asymmetric load 4, 5 is applied to the secondary side 3 of the transformer. A magnetizing current in the primary winding corresponding to the load 5 of the secondary winding 3 is controlled through the agency of different conduction times of the two directionally opposed devices 9, 10 .
