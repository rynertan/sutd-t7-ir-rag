The compounds of formula I are useful both in the free base form and in the form of acid addition salts with both forms being within the purview of this invention.The acid addition salts are simply a more convenient form for use and, in practice, use of the salt amounts to use of the free base. The acids which can be used include those which produce, when combined with the free base, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, that is salts whose anions are relatively inocuous to the animal organism in pharmaceutical doses of the salts.In practice, it is convenient to form sulfate, phosphate, methansulfate or lactate salts. Others are those derived from mineral acids e.g., hydrochloric , and organic acids such as acetic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, ethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, toluenesulfonic acid and the like. The acid salts are prepared by standard techniques such as by dissolving the free base in aqueous or aqueous alcohol solution or other suitable solvents containing the appropriate acid and isolating by evaporating the solution, or by reacting the free base and in an organic solvent in which case the salt separates directly or can be obtained by concentration of the solution. In general, the compounds of this invention are prepared by standard techniques analogously known in the art. A convenient synthesis for preparing the compounds of formula I conveniently involves the reaction of a 5 acyl 2 1H pyridinone 11 with the appropriate alkoxyamine, preferably in the form of an acid addition salt, according to standard oximination reaction conditions.In effecting the oximination, the alkoxyamine is contacted with a base e.g., pyridine to form an anion which is then condensed with the 5 acyl 2 1H pyridinone II by heating the reactants together in an inert solvent.The reaction proceeds well at temperatures between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture. Reaction at reflux is preferred wherein any art recognized solvent, such as ethanol, may be utilized. The foregoing reaction is depicted as follows Reaction Scheme A EMI4.1 wherein R1, R3, R4, R5 and R6 are as defined. Of course in those instances wherein the 5 acyl 2 1H pyridinone bears substituents which would be unstable under the reaction conditions, then such substituent bearing compounds would first be modified. Then, upon completion of the oximination reaction, the desired compounds may be obtained. Such procedures are well known and represent standard techniques welli known in the art. The 5 acyl 2 lH pyridinone intermediates II are prepared by standard techniques analogously known in the art. A preferred synthesis for preparing these intermediates conveniently involves the reaction of an appropriate l R5 3 R6 2 l dimethylamino l R4 methylidenyl 1,3 propanedione III with an appropriately R3 substituted acetoacetamide IV according to standard Michael addition addition reaction conditions. Preferably, the substituted acetamide is reacted with sodiums hydride, under argon in an inert organic solvent, e.g., tetrahydrofuran to form an anion which is then condensed with the diketone III by heating the reactants together in an inert organic solvent, preferably tetrahydrofuran and the like. Preferably, the temperature of the reaction is about 500C although the reaction proceeds well at temperatures between room temperature and 100 C.Heating is effected over a period of several hours although it is preferred to allow the reaction to proceed overnight. When R5 and R6 are not the same a mixture of products are obtained which are separated quite nicely by flash chromatography wherein the reaction product mixture is admixed with 60 200 mesh silica gel and the column is eluted with an appropriate solvent system e.g., 35 ethylacetate 65 methylene chloride .The frCtibns bel Lt are monitored by thin layer chromatography. The foregoing reaction is depicted as follows Reaction Scheme B EMI5.1 wherein R4 R5 and R6 are as previously defined, R3 is cyano, C02H, lower alkyl or NH2 R3 is cyano, C02H, lower alkyl or N CH phenyl. The l R5 3R6 2 l dimethylamino alkylidenyl l,3 propanediones III are readily prepared by condensing the appropriate Rg, R6 l,3 propandiones with the appro priately R4 substituted N, N dialkylamino dialkoxy methane e.g., dimethylformamide acetals according to standard condensation reaction conditions such as, for example, contacting equimolar quantities of the reactants together, optionally in an inert organic solvent and stirring the mixture for 1 12 hours at about room temperature. This reaction is depicted as follows Reaction Scheme C EMI6.1 wherein R4, Rg and R6 are as previously defined. In those instances, wherein X is other than lower alkyl, hydroxy, alkoxy, halogen, nitro, cyano, amino, and h is other than cyano, it is preferred to prepare a a compound of formula I wherein X is cyano, and then, by the use of standard techniques, convert the cyano moiety to the desired substituents. For example, the cyano moiety may be converted to a carboxyl moiety by hydrolyzing the nitrile with 6N hydrochloric acid, sulfuric and or other mineral acids under standard conditions such as by heating at reflux temperatures for about 12 24 hours. The carboxyl moiety may be converted to an alkoxycarbonyl moiety by the standard Fisher esterification procedure such as by heating the carboxy containing compounds with an appropriate alcohol in the presence of an acid, e.g., 3 hydrochloric acid. The carboxamido containing compounds may be prepared by converting the alkoxycarbonyl moiety by heating the esters in the presence of ammonia or an appropriate amine, preferably in a pressure bomb at about 100 150 C in an inert solvent, e.g., benzene, toluene and the like. Alternatively, the carboxamido moiety may be prepared by hydrolyzing a nitrile with concentrated sulfuric acid by heating on a steam bath at temperatures of about 50 1000C. In those instances wherein R3 is cyano, it is preferred to have the ultimately desired X substituent on the phenyl ring prior to the Michael addition reaction between the l R5 3 R6 2 l dimethyl amino l R4 methylidenyl 1, 3 propanedione and the cyano substituted acetamide. In those instances wherein X is imidazol 2 yl, such compounds are prepared by a condensation reaction wherein the nitrile is heated to from about 150 200 C with ethylene do gamine for about 2 hours. The amidino compounds are prepared from corresponding nitriles wherein the nitrile is converted to an imino ether which is converted to the amidino moiety by treating the imino ether with ammonia in alcohol at temperatures of about OOC room temperature. The sulfones and sulfoxides may be prepared from the alkylthio moiety by standard oxidation procedures. In those instances wherein the R3 substituent is hydrogen, it is preferred to chemically remove a cyano moiety from a compound of formula I by standard techniques such as by conversion of the cyano moiety to a carboxyl radical by treatment with a strong acid and then the compound decarboxylated Alternatively, the carboxyl radical may be converted to an alkyl moiety by standardGrignard reaction conditions. The preparation of the compounds of formula I may be illustrated by the following specific examples.

In a similar manner, by substituting the reactants of Examples 20 23 with the equivalent amounts of the appropriate alkoxyamine and the appropriate 5 acyl 1,26 R6 2 oxo pyridinone particularly those prepared inExamples 1 19 and by substantially following the procedure of Examples 20 23 there may be produced the desired alkoxyimino ethers of Formula I and in particular the following compounds l,2 dihydro 5 1 methoxyimino ethyl 6 ethyl 2 oxo 3 pyridinecarbonitri le 1,2 dihydro 5 1 methoxyimino butyl 6 ethyl 2 oxo 3 pyridinecarbonitrile 1 ,2 dihydro 5 1 methoxyimino pentyl 6 ethyl 2 oxo 3 pyridinecarbonitrile 1, 2 dihydro 5 l methoxyimino hexylj 6 ethyl 2 oxo 3 pyridinecarbonitrile 1,2 dihydro 5 tl methoxyimino ethyl 6 methyl 2 oxo 3 pyridinecarbonitrile 1,2 dihydro 5 1 methoxyimino propyl 6 methyl 2 oXo 3 pyridinecarbonitrile 1,2 dihydro 5 1 methoxyimino butyl 6 methyl 2 oxo 3pyridinecarbonitrile.as well as the ethoxyimino, propoxyimino, butyroxyimino, homologs of the foregoing and the 3 position carboxylic acid, carboxylic acid alkyl ester, carbamate, amino, 3 hydrogen and 3 lower alkyl analogs i.e., 3 pyridinecarboxylic acid ethyl esters, 3 pyridinecarboxamides, 3 aminopyridines, pyridine and 3 alkylpyridine of the foregoing. The compounds of general Formula 1 may be used in the treatment of cardiac failure including congestive heart failure, backward heart failure, forward heart failure, left ventricular heart failure, or right ventricular heart failure or in the treatment of any other condition which requires the strengthening of heart action with a cardiotonic. The utility of Formula 1 compounds as cardiotonics may be determined by administering the test compound 0.01 0.3 mg kg intravenously, intraperitoneally, intraduodenally or intragastrically in a suitable vehicle to a mongrel dog either sex . The test dogs are anesthetized and prepared by isolating a suitable artery e g. femoral or common cir o t.i dl aid carôtid e.g., femoral or external jugular introducing polyethylene catheters filled with 0.1 Heparin Na to record arterial blood pressure and administer compounds, respectively. The chest is opened by splittingthe sternum at the midline or by an incision at the left fifth intercostal space, and a pericardial cradle is formed to support the heart. A Walton Brodie strain gage is sutured to the right or left ventricle to monitor myocardial contractile force.An electromagnetic flow probe may be placed around the root of the ascending aorta for measuring cardiac output less coronary blood flow. Heart failure is induced by administering sodium pentobarbital 20 to 40 mg kg followed by a continuous infusion of 1 2 mg kg min. or propranalol hydrochloride 4 mg kg followed by a continuous infusion of 0.18 mg kg min. to the blood perfusing the heart. Following administration of either of these cardiac depressants, the right atrial pressure dramatically increases and cardiac output is severely depressed. Reversal of these effects by the test compound indicates cardiotonic activity. The compounds may be administered in various manners to achieve the desired effect. The compounds may be administered alone or in the form of pharmaceutical preparations to the patient being treated either orally or parenterally, that is, intravenously or intramuscularly. The amount of compound administered will vary with the patient, the severity of the cardiac failure and the mode of administration. For oral or parenteral administration the cardiotonically effective amount of compound is from about 0.01 mg kg of patients body weight per day up to about 100 mg kg of patient body weight per day and preferably from about 0.01 mg kg of patient body weight per day up to about 50 mg kg of patient body weight per day. For oral administration a unit dosage may contain, for example, from 0.1 to 750 mg of the active ingredient, preferably about 0.5 to 500 mg of the active ingredient.For parenteral administration a unit dosage may contain, for example, from 0.1 to 250 mg of the active ingredient, preferably about 0.5 to 100. Repetitive daily administration of the compounds may be desired and will vary with the condition of the patient and the mode of administration. As used herein the term patient is taken to mean warm blooded animals, for example, birds, such as chickens and turkeys, and mammals, such as primates, humans, sheep, horses, bovine cows and bulls, pigs, dogs, cats, rats and mice. For oral administration the compounds can be formulated into solid or liquid preparations such as capsules, pills, tablets, troches, powders, solutions, suspensions or emulsions. The solid unit dosage forms can be a capsule which can be of the ordinary gelatin type containing, for example, lubricants and inert filler, such as lactose, sucrose and cornstarch. In another embodiment the compounds of general Formula 1 can be tableted with conventional tablet bases such as lactose, sucrose and cornstarch in combination with binders, such as acacia, cornstarch or gelatin, disintegrating agents such as potato starch or alginic acid, and a lubricant such as stearic acid or magnesium stearate. For parenteral administration the compounds may be administered as injectable dosages of a solution or suspension of the compound in a physiologically acceptable diluent with a pharmaceutical carrier which can be a sterile liquid such as water1 alcohols, oils and other acceptable organic solvents with or without the addition of a surfactant and other pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants. Illustrative of oils which can be employed in these preparations are those of petroleum, animal, vegetable, or synthetic origin, for example, peanut oil, soybean oil and mineral oil. In general, water, saline, agueous dextrose and related sugar solutions, ethanol and glycols such as propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol or 2 pyrrolidone are preferred liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. The compounds can be administered in the form of a depot injection or implant preparation which may be formulated in such a manner as to permit a sustained release of the active ingredient. The active ingredient can be compressed into pellets or small cylinders and implanted subcutaneously or intramuscularly as depot injections or implants. Implants may employ inert materials such as biodegradable polymers or synthetic silicones, for example, Silastic, a silicone rubber manufactured by the Dow Corning Corporation. As is true in many large classes of compounds certain subgeneric members and certain specific members of the class are preferred for the pharmaceutical activity in treating disease states in man. In this instance the preferred compounds of formula I are those wherein R5 is lower alkyl. The preferred R3 substituent is cyano, hydrogen, lower alkyl or amino. The preferredR4 substituent is hydrogen, the preferred R6 substituents are either ethyl or methyl and the preferred R1 is methyl or ethyl.The preferred compounds are those wherein R3 is hydrogen or cyano, R4 is hydrogen, R6 is methyl or ethyl and R5 is any straight chain hydrocarbyl radical, and R1 is methyl and ethyl with the specific compounds most preferred being 1, 2 dihydro 5 l methoxyimino ethyl 6 methyl 2 oxo 3 pyridinecarbonitrile 1,2 dihydro 5 tl methoxyimino propyl 6 methyl 2 oxo 3 pyridinecarbonitrile 1,2 dihydro 5 1 methoxyimino butyl 6 methyl 2 oXo 3 pyridinecarbonitri le 1,2 dihydro 5 1 methoxyimino pentyl 6 methyl 2 oxo 3 pyridinecarbonitrile 1,2 dihydro 5 1 methoxyimino hexyl 6 methyl 2 oxo 3pyridinecarbonitrile 1,2 dihydro 5 tl methoxyimino heptanyl 6 methyl 2 oxo 3 pyridinecarbonitrile 1, 2 dihydro 5 l methoxyimino ethylj 6 ethyl 2 oxo 3 pyridinecarbonitrile 1, 2 dihydro 5 1 methoxyimino propyl 6 ethyl 2 oxo 3 pyridinecarbonitrile 1, 2 dihydro 5 l methoxyimino butylj 6 ethyl 2 oxo 3 pyridinecarbonitrile 1, 2 dihydro 5 l methoxyimino pentyl 6 ethyl 2 oxo 3 pyridinecarbonitrile 1,2 dihydro 5 1 methoxyimino hexyl 6 ethyl 2 oXo 3 pyridinecarbonitrile 1,2 dihydro S l methoxyímino heptanyl 6 ethyl 2 oxo 3 pyridinecarbonitrile, and the 3H analogs i.e., the 1,2 dihydro 5 l alkoxyimino alkyli 6 alkyl 2 lH pyridinones of the foregoing specific compounds.
