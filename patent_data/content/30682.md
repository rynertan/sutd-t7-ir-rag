# Test composition for peroxidatively active substances, test device containing the composition, process for preparing same and method for the determination of peroxidatively active substances.

## Abstract
Improved test compositions, devices and methods for the detecting of peroxidatively active substances are pro vided. The test compositions include an indicator capable of being oxidized in the presence of peroxidatively active sub stances to provide a color change, an oxidized agent effec tive to oxidize said indicator, and a sensitizing agent. The sensitizing agent comprises 4 azafluorene.
