# A quick opening closing device of the unloading mouth of big bottomless bags, containing granulated materials.

## Abstract
The device consists in a collar 1 with a reel 2 , inserted in the groove 1a thereof, that will keep, by friction, the belt 4 for the contraction of the total lower opening 5 of the bag S containing granulated materials, that will be quickly unloaded following to the pulling of a lace L applied to a hook 3 out of one piece with said reel 2 , so as to determine the sliding of the belt 4 and the quick opening of the big bag S .

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. A quick opening closing device of the unloading mouth of big, bottomless bags containing granulated materials, comprising an element for the contraction of the lower part of the bags being without hopper, characterized in a collar 1 of curvilinear shape, delimited by two la teral surfaces 1a and by a ground surface Ib , and in a reel 2 with a toothed surface, with an eccentric rotation axis parallel to the generating lines of ground 1b of a groove lea , so that when the same rotates it may get in close contact with said surface so as to block the sliding of a belt 4 that will close the bag s inlet, while said reel may be distance rotated by means of a lace L in that sense in which the lateral surfa ce 1a gets away from the groove s ground so as to cau se the disengagement of the belt, and further characte rized in a big bag S with a lower opening 5 with sqare dimensions equal to the average square dimensions. 2. A quick opening closing device according to claim 1, cha racterized in that the collar 1 has a linear shape. 3. ick opening closing device according to claim 1, cha racterized in that reel 2 shows a smooth surface. 4. A quick opening closing device according to claim 1, cha racterized in means for the blocking of the belt s end like a contrast lock. 5. A quick opening closing device according to the prece dent claims, characterized in means for applying seals and for maintaining the same device connected to the bag, like an eyelet 6 . 6. A quick opening closing device according to claim 1, cha racterized in the presence of a hook 3 , out of one piece with reel 2 , for the application of the distan ce operated lace L .

## Description
A QUICK OPEN1NG CLOSING DEVICE OF THE UNLOADING MOUTHOF BIG, BOTTOMLESS BAGS, CONTAINING GRANULATED MATERIALS .Andrea LENT I Paolo GUARINITommaso DE PASQUALEThe present invention concerns a quick opening closing device of the unloading mouth of big, bottomless bags that contain granulated materials, comprising a contraction collar of the lower opening of said bags with blocking and releasing elements.It is already well known that the big bags for loading and unloading granulated materials show, at the bottom thereof, a hopper opening being closed by rings for hooking while lifting and transporting and that may be opened for unloading.However, the small section of the hopper causes the material inside to take a very long time for unloading.For resolving this problem, sometimes big bags are used with a closed bottom that, when unloading, will be manually perforated thus the working times are accelerated but, at the same time, the costs increase because these bags may be used only one time.Furthermore, the use of the big bags with a closed bottom that may be perforated for unloading, represents a great danger for the operators when the materials suddenly fall down, as well as for the need of working nearby the casting where the dust will be inhaled with very dangerous results for the health.It is the aim of the present invention to realize a device for unloading the big bags being functional, unexpensive and safe for the health of the operators.The aim set forth is reached by the device according to the present invention, comprising a curve or linear collar, a reel inserted In the groove of the collar with the eccentric rotation axis and releasing eyelet, a belt made out of hemps or any other suitable material, and a big bag provided with a lower opening of such square dimensions equal to the average dimensions of the structure and therefore without the hopper opening, because it is completely lacking the bottom.The present invention will be described more in detail hereimbelow according to the drawings in which a preferred embodiment is shown.Figure 1 shows a perspective view of a big bag full of materiaI, closed at the lower end there of by the collar device.Figure 2 shows a perspective view of the closing devi ce in the contraction position of the full big bag. Figure 3 shows the big bag open for unloading.Figure 4 shows a perspective view of the device of fi gure 2 In the open position thereof.The figures show the quick opening closing device of the unloading mouth of big bottomless bags comprising a curve collar l,.a reel 2 inserted in the groove ta of collar 1 with eccentric rotation axis and releasing eyelet, a belt 4 and a big bag S with lower opening 5 of such square dimensions equal to the average square dimensions.The functioning principle of the device according to the present invention is based on the pressure that the toothed reel 2 performs, with the lateral surface thereof, on the ground of the groove 1a of collar 1, when said reel rotates around the eccentric axis thereof.This allows to block the belt between the ground of the groove and the lateral surface of the reel, thus preventing the opening of bag S, because the belt is mounted in such a way that the pressure performed by the same, due to the closing effect of the bag s mouth, forces the reel to rotate in that sense in which the lateral surface thereof willNeasier get into contact with the ground Ib of the groove. Furthermore, the lateral surface of the reel performs a friction onto the belt due to the toothing as well as to eventual suitable roughness.For obtaining the opening of the big bag S it is sufficient to apply a traction onto hook 3 by means of a lace L that may be distance operated and that forces the reel to rotate in the sense opposite to the blocking one, i.e. in that sense in which the lateral surface thereof is far from the ground Ib of the groove la. The device may be provided with means for allowing the application of seals for guaranteeing the closing.The end of the belt may be fixed by means of a contrast lock furthermore, the device may be provided with an eyelet 6 out of one piece with collar 1 for keeping the same connected to the bag and thus preventing the same to get lost.
