# Ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus.

## Abstract
In an ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus, the center fre quency of the spectrum of the received echo signal is decreased, depending upon the penetration depth of the patient. This phenomenon is noticeable when the frequency of the excited ultrasonic waves is selected to a higher range. The ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus 100 employs an STC circuit 19 , a gain of which is varied in accordance with the penetration depth of the patient.
