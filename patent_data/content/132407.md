# Ultraviolet light assisted fluorination of polymer surfaces.

## Abstract
A process for fluorinating a polymer to form a fluorinated polymer surface, characterized by exposing the polymer to ultraviolet light while contacting the surface of said polymer with a fluorinated species selected from the group consisting of fluorine, tetrafluoromethane, hydrogen fluoride, hexafluoro ethane, sulfur hexafluoride, difluoromethane, trifluorome thane, and mixtures thereof, under conditions to effect fluori nation of the surface of said polymer.
