# FUEL INJECTION PUMP

## Abstract
A fuel injection pump comprises a rotor 21 located in a housing 22, 23 , a free piston 40 movably mounted in an axial bore of the rotor 21 , two pump chambers 41, 42 which is formed by dividing said bore by the free piston, and two solenoid valves 27, 28 for supplying fuel to the two pump chambers, one of the chambers 41 receiving therein the fuel to be injected and the other 42 for effecting control of the injection timing. This injection pump is characterized in that two preparatory chambers 33, 34 are provided downstream of the solenoid valves 27, 28 to keep fuel measured by the solenoid valves during the compression operation of said pump chambers and transfer the fuel to said pump chamber after completion of the compression whereby precise measurement of the fuel can be effected.
