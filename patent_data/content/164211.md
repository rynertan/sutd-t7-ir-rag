# Moulded insulator housing.

## Abstract
A moulded insulator housing of thermoplastic material for an electrical terminal or terminals 22 comprises a plurality of walls which define a corresponding number of elongate cavi ties 20 having respective openings 21 at one end of the insu lator housing 10 for terminal insertion. The insulator housing has a terminal lock 30 for each cavity integrally hinged to an outward flange 32 on its bottom wall 14 at the one end of the insulator housing, and a slot 38 for each cavity in the bot tom wall which defines an inner surface 44 for the terminal lock and flange portions which is substantially coplanar with an outer surface 46 of the adjacent portions of the bottom wall, to facilitate the moulding of the terminal lock substantially free of and separate from the material in the bottom wall. The terminal lock is movable from its as moulded position, in which it projects outwardly of the bottom wall at least as much as the flange, into a second, retained position in which a portion of the terminal lock passes through the slot in the bot tom wall and projects into the cavity to provide a terminal lock.
