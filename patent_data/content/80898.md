## Description
LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAY DEVICES This invention relates to liquid crystal display devices, and in particular to a device that appears black in transmission when unenergised and, when energised, is capable of revealing one of two possible alternative legends in black displayed against contrasting backgrounds of different colour.Alternatively an inverse format of electrode pattern can be used to provide the two legends in the two different colours each set against a black background. This device incorporates a pair of twisted nematic liquid crystal display cells. The conventional twisted nematic liquid crystal display cell has a thin layer of positive dielectric anisotropy nematic liquid crystal material enclosed by two glass plates and a perimeter seal. Transparent conductors, typically of indium tin oxide, are defined on the inward facing surfaces of the two glass plates to give areas of overlap corresponding to the legend to be displayed. The electrodes on these inward facing surfaces may be covered with a thin insulating layer to prevent the passage of direct current through the cell as such current flow can produce electrolytic degradation of the liquid crystal material. The surfaces are then treated to produce, in the absence of any applied field, a particular alignment of the molecules of the liquid crystal adjacent these surfaces.In the case of the twisted nematic cell, the required alignment for each surface is parallel homogeneous alignment, that is the molecules should all lie in a common direction that can be resolved into two components, respectively normal to the plane of the surface and in the plane of the surface. For parallel homogeneous alignment the normal component may be zero zero tilt , but there must be a substantial planar component. The two plates are then assembled so that the planar component of the molecular alignment direction of one plate is perpendicular to that of the 0 other thereby giving a 90 twist. The conventional way of achieving the requisite alignment properties is by rubbing or by oblique evaporation.The perimeter seal, by which the two plates are secured together to form a hermetic enclosure for the liquid crystal layer, is typically of plastics material or glass. When glass is used, it is normally applied by screen printing in the form of a frit which is subsequently fused.Normally the cell is filled via an aperture formed by a break in the perimeter seal. In the case of a fused frit perimeter seal this aperture is conveniently sealed off by means of a suitable solder after the cell has been filled. The cell is operated between a pair of linear polarisers whose polarisation planes are either parallel or crossed, and the cell is oriented so that at each major surface of the liquid crystal layer the planar component of the molecular alignment direction lies in, or normal to, the.polarisation planes. In the unenergised state the cell effectively rotates the plane of polarisation through 900, and so the assembly appears transparent if the polarisation planes are crossed, or black if they are parallel. When the cell is then energised by the application of a suitable electric field across the thickness of the layer, the molecular alignment is converted to homeotropic in the regions of the field. Homeotropic alignment produces no rotation of the plane of polarisation, and hence the appearance of these regions is reversed. In the construction of a twisted nematic cell some consideration needs to be taken to avoid problems of reverse twist and reverse tilt effects. These are phenomena resulting from a lack of bias. In the case of reverse twist the problem is that the display field divides into regions where the twist is left handed separated by other regions where it is right handed. In the case of reverse tilt the problem is that when the cell relaxes back from an electric field induced homeotropic alignment state there is insufficient bias to prevent some molecules from rotating one way towards homogeneous alignment while others rotate the opposite way. These problems are well known, as also are ways of overcoming them.These ways include use of a chiral additive to the nematic mixture so as to produce a cholesteric pitch at least four times longer than the liquid crystal layer thickness additionally or alternatively the use of molecular alignment techniques providing a significant tilt angle at the major surfaces of the liquid crystal and additionally or alternatively the use of a twist angle, the angle between the planar components of the molecular alignment directions, that is not quite 900, being typically in the range 880 to 890.In the light of these known techniques for dealing with the problems of reverse tilt and reverse twist it is to be understood that in this specification when reference is made to a 900 twisted nematic cell this is to be understood as extending to cells which for the purposes of avoiding these phenomena incorporate a chiral additive and alternatively or additionally incorporate a twist angle that is not exactly 900. According to the present invention there is provided a liquid crystal display device having between crossed neutral linear polarisers a first 900 twisted nematic internally electroded display cell whose electrodes overlap in part, characterised in that said first cell is in a tandem arrangement between the crossed neutral linear polarisers with a second 900 twisted nematic internally electroded display cell whose electrodes overlap in part, wherein the two cells are oriented such that at each major surface of the two liquid crystal layers the planar component of the molecular alignment direction is either normal to or lies in the plane of the polarisation plane of one of the polarisers, and wherein either at least one of the liquid crystal layers acts as the host for a guest dichroic dye, with the orientation of that cell being such that the planar component of the molecular alignment direction at the major surface nearer the adjacent neutral polariser is normal to the plane of polarisation of that polariser, or at least one coloured linear polariser is located between the cells with its polarisation plane aligned in the polarisation plane of one of the neutral polarisers. There follows a description of examples of liquid crystal display device embodying the invention in preferred forms. The description refers to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 depicts a schematic cross section through a first example of liquid crystal display device, and Figure 2 depicts a schematic cross section through a second example. Referring to Figure 1, a pair of 900 twisted nematic display cells is formed by three glass sheets 1,2 and 3 and two perimeter seals 4 and 5. Glass sheet 2 is thus seen to be common to both cells. The two cells contain layers 6 and 7 of a nematic liquid crystal material to which have been added guest dichroic dyes of contrasting colour. The inward facing surfaces of sheets 1 and 3 are provided respectively with transparent indium tin oxide counter electrode layers 8 and 9 covering the whole area of the liquid crystal layers, and themselves are covered with barrier layers 10 and 11 of silica. The outward facing surfaces of sheets 1 and 2 are covered respectively with layers 12 and 13 of neutral linear polariser arranged in crossed configuration. Both surfaces of sheet 2 are similarly provided with transparent indium tin oxide electrode layers 14 and 15, but in this instance portions are omitted from each layer in the form of one of the legends that the display device is required to display in black against a coloured background. If desired the arrangement of electrode and counter electrode can be interchanged for either or both of the cells. The counter electrodes also are insulated from the liquid crystal layers by means of silica barrier layers 16 and 17. All four barrier layers 10,11,16 and 17 are covered with molcular alignment layers 18,19,20 and 21 each providing, in the absence of an applied electric field, parallel homogeneous alignment of the liquid crystal molecules at the adjacent surface of the respective liquid crystal layer 6 or 7.In the case of cells whose perimeter seals are made of fused glass frit these alignment layers may conveniently be provided by the oblique evaporation of silica, using a 5 evaporation to give one alignment layer producing significant tilt, and a 300 evaporation for the opposing alignment layer to produce substantially no tilt. The alignment layers are oriented so that the planar components of the molecular alignment directions of layers 18 and 20 are substantially normal to the polarisation plane of the polariser 12, while those of layers 19 and 21 are substantially normal to the polarisation plane of polariser 13.This provides each cell with its requisite twist, orients the cell with respect to its adjacent polariser so that it will rotate the plane of polarisation of light entering the cell from that polariser, and furthermore orients it so that the guest dye molecules of that cell will absorb that light. In the ensuing analysis it will be assumed for the sake of example that the polarisation plane of polariser 12 is at right angles to the plane of the page of Figure 1. Considering first the situation when no potential is applied across either cell, the plane polarised light passing through polariser 12 has its 0 plane of polarisation rotated through 90 as it passes through the first cell liquid crystal layer 6 by virtue of the fact that the molecules are homogeneously aligned with a 900 twist. The dye molecules at the surface nearer the polariser are aligned in the plane of the page, and hence at right angles to the plane of polarisation of the incident light. Thus the dye will absorb light. Light transmitted through the first cell, and entering the second, enters liquid crystal layer 7 plane polarised in the plane of the page.The plane of 0 polarisation is rotated through 90 on passage through the thickness of this layer, but in this instance the dye does not absorb light because the dye molecules are aligned in the plane of polarisation. The emergent light is plane polarised at right angles to the plane of the page, and thus is not transmitted by polariser 13. Thus in the unenergised state the device appears entirely black in transmission. When the first cell is energised by the application of a suitable alternating potential between electrodes 8 and 14, while the second cell remains unenergised, the regions of layer 6 between the electrodes are converted from homogeneous alignment to homeotropic alignment. In these regions the plane of polarisation of the light is not rotated on passage through the layer. Therefore in the corresponding regions of the second cell the dye molecules of the liquid crystal layer 7 of this cell are aligned normal to the plane of polarisation of the light, and thus absorb light.On passage through the thickness of this layer the polarisation plane is rotated through 900, and hence in the regions registering with the homeotropically aligned regions of the first cell the emergent light is plane polarised in the plane of the page, and thus passes through the second polariser. In this way, when the device is viewed in transmission, the unswitched portions of the first cell, that is those regions where the electrodes 8 and 14 do not overlap, provide a black legend set against a coloured background provided by the dye of the second cell. When the second cell is energised, while the first is left unenergised, the dye molecules of the first cell are oriented to absorb light. The first cell also rotates the plane of polarisation through 900 so that the light is incident upon the second cell polarised in the plane of the page. The unswitched 0 portions of the second cell also impart a 90 rotation, so that from these portions the light emerges polarised at right angles to the plane of the page, and in consequence is absorbed by the polariser 13. The switched regions of the second cell are homeotropically aligned, and so in these regions the dye of the second cell does not absorb light, and neither is its plane of polarisation rotated. This light is therefore transmitted by the second polariser 13.Thus under these circumstances, when the device is viewed in transmission, the unswitched portions of the second cell appear as a black legend set against a coloured background provided by the dye of the first cell. If the contrasting background colour for one of the legends of the device is white, or is provided by the colour of the illumination used to view the device, then the cell containing the electrodes associated with the other legend does not need to contain any dichroic dye. Since there is no dye in this cell the planar component of the alignment direction at the surface nearer the adjacent polariser does not have to be normal to its plane of polarisation, but can lie in that plane. The cell does however still have to incorporate the requisite 900 twist. It is not necessary for the two cells to share a common wall, and the device can be constructed by cementing together two individual cells in the appropriate relative orientation. If this sort of construction is used one or both of the dyes can be replaced by a coloured linear polariser, such as marketed by Sanritsu Electric Co. Ltd. of Tokyo, placed between the cells. Such an arrangement is depicted inFigure 2. Any integer appearing in this Figure 2 that has its counterpart in the device of Figure 1 is identified by the index numeral used for it in theFigure 1 device. The basic differences between the two devices is that the single sheet 2 common to both cells has been replaced by two sheets 20 and 21, and the liquid crystal layers 6a and 7a contain no dichroic dye, but instead two coloured linear polarisers 22 and 23 are sandwiched between the sheets 20 and 21. These coloured polarisers are of contrasting colour, and the polarisation plane of one is aligned with that of the neutral polariser 12, while that of the other is aligned with that of neutral polariser 13. The operation of this device is substantially the same as that of the device of Figure 1, for all that has in effect been done to each cell is to remove the dichroic dye from within the cell and relocate it on an outer surface of the cell. When neither cell is energised the device looks black in transmission. When the first cell alone is energised the legend of the first cell electrode pattern is revealed in black against the background colour of the coloured polariser whose plane of polarisation is aligned with that of the neutral polariser 13. When the second cell alone is energised the legend is that of the other cell revealed against the background colour of the second coloured polariser. If the contrasting background colour for one of the legends is white, or is provided by the colour of the illumination used to view the device, one of the coloured polarisers is omitted from the construction. It should be appreciated that since neither cell contains dichroic dye the planar component of the alignment direction at the surfaces nearer their respective adjacent neutral polarisers 12 and 13 do not have to be normal to their respective planes of polarisation, but can lie in those planes. Both cells do however still have to incorporate the requisite 900 twist. Instead of replacing the dyes of both cells with coloured polarisers it is also possible to replace the dye of only one of the cells with a single coloured polariser.
