# An internal combustion engine piston and a method of producing the same.

## Abstract
A composite internal combustion engine piston has a piston cap constituted by plural ceramic pieces 1, 2, 3 and a metal piston body 10, the piston cap being fixed to the top portion of the metal piston body. The piston cap is made of one or more kinds of ceramic materials. To reduce thermal stress in the ceramic pieces, the ceramic pieces constituting the ce ramic cap and the metal piston body are bonded together through a metallized layer coated onto the ceramic pieces and a metal plated layer coated onto the metallized layer in such a manner that the bonding area between the ceramic piece or pieces and the metal piston body is larger at the top central portion of the metal piston body than that between the ceramic piece or pieces and the metal piston body at the other portion.
