# Control system for electrical heating cooling apparatus.

## Abstract
A conventional control system for an electrical heating or cooling apparatus has a thermostat 103 which controls a compressor 102 to cycle on and off. For peak load periods, a load shedding signal is sent out by the power company which controls a duty cycler 100 via a radio receiver 101. The duty cycler 100 sets reference ON and OFF times from the last thermostat cycle, and thereupon over rides the thermostat by preventing the ON time of each cycle from exceeding, and the OFF time of each cycle from being less than, the reference ON and OFF times. To prevent tampering, the reference ON and OFF times may be restricted by preset maximum and minimum values respectively, and reset during a load shed period if the thermostat ON and OFF times fall short of or exceed the reference times respectively. Alternatively, the reference times may be taken from the last thermostat cycle whose times are within preset limits.
