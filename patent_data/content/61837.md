# Ultrasonically operated water faucet.

## Abstract
A water faucet 30 is disclosed that is automatically turned on and off in response to the proximity of the user s hand or other object to the faucet. An ultrasonic transducer 24 is located in the faucet near the water outlet 22 and transmits bursts of ultrasonic waves. When a wave reflects off a user s hand and creates an echo signal, the echo is detected by the ultrasonic transducer. Circuitry 26 con nected to the ultrasonic transducer determines when an object is within a predetermined distance of the faucet by measuring the time elapsed between the transmission of the burst and the reception of the echo. Once an object is within this predetermined distance, the circuitry causes a valve 20 to open and water is supplied by the faucet.
