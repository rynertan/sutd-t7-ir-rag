# Improved film compositions.

## Abstract
A heat sealable blend of a butene 1 ethylene copolymer, about 2 to 9 by weight of polypropylene and from about 0.02 to 1.5 by weight of high density polyethylene can be processed at high line speed in the blown bubble extrusion process to form films or sheets exhibiting improved heat sealing characteristics, processability, tear strength and other properties.
