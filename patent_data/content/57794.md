# An optical connector.

## Abstract
An optical connector 10 comprises two optic fibres 44, 46 which are axially aligned and relatively rotatable. In order to reduce the sensitivity of the connector 10 to axial misalignment of the fibres 44, 46 and to variation in the spacing between the ends of the fibres, each fibre is provided with a cylindrical lens 40, 42 . The lens 40 provided at the end of the emitting fibre 44 collimates the emitted light into a parallel beam which is greater in diameter than the emitting fibre 44 . The other lens 42 focusses the parallel beam into the end of the other fibre 46 .
