# Terminals.

## Abstract
Electrical terminals for switches and the like are formed by folding a strip of metal upon itself to form a loop with overlapping ends and providing a screw threaded bore. The terminal may have a silver or silver alloy layer. Terminals may be made by applying a silver or silver alloy layer to a metal sheet followed by cutting the sheet into strips and folding.

## Description
TerminalsThis invention relates to electric terminals which are particularly but not exclusively suitable for use in switches.In electric switches, for household and other uses, a moving member such as a rocker comes into contact with a terminal to close the circuit. The terminal may comprise a ring of a metal such as brass having a screw passing through the ring to clamp the exposed end of an electric lead within the ring and the moving member comes into contact with the outside surface of the ring. The portions of the surfaces of the ring and moving member which come into contact with each other are commonly coated with silver or a silver alloy.Known ring terminals of this type are generally made by machining them to shape from a solid piece of metal followed by application of silver or silver alloy to the individual terminals.The present invention is intended to provide a terminal and a method of making it which is simple and cheap.According to one aspect of the invention an electrical terminal comprises a strip of metal which is folded upon itself to form a closed loop with the end parts of the strip overlapping each other, the strip being provided with a screw threaded bore to receive a screw for clamping an electrical lead inside the loop.In a preferred arrangement the bore passes through the overlapping end parts of the strip which are in contact with each other. The extremity of one end part may be of lesser width than the remainder of the strip and extend into a corresponding hole in the strip adjacent the other end part.The outer surface of the strip may be provided with a silver or silver alloy layer at the location on the terminal intended to engage a movable contact member in a switch or the like.According to another aspect of the invention a method of making such terminals having a silver or silver alloy layer comprises providing a metal sheet with a continuous longitudinal surface layer of silver or alloy thereof, the layer having a width equal to the width of the desired silver or alloy layer on the terminal, cutting the sheet transversely to the silver layer to form a plurality of strips, folding each strip upon itself to form a closed loop with the end parts of the strip overlapping each other and providing a screw threaded bore in the strip.The silver or alloy layer may be applied to the sheet either as an inlay within a corresponding groove in the sheet or it may form an overlay on the sheet surface. The silver or alloy layer may be attached to the sheet by seam welding. The thickness and width of the silver or alloy strip are generally chosen according to the magnitude of the electric current to be passed through the terminal.When the extremity of one part passes through a hole in the strip the narrowed extremity and the hole may be formed by punching out of either the cut strips or the sheet before cutting. The narrowed extremity is passed thr6ugh the hole during folding.A terminal and a method of making it will be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 shows a terminal for use in a switch Figure 2 is a view of the terminal perpendicular to Figure 1 Figure 3 shows a sheet from which the terminal is formed and, Figure 4 is a cross section of a switch using terminals according to Figure 1.The terminal shown in Figures 1 and 2 comprises a strip 1 of a metal such as brass which is bent to form a closed loop. The end portions 2 and 3 of the strip overlap and are parallel and in contact with each other as shown inFigure 1. End portion 2 terminates in a tab 4 of lesser width than the strip which is situated in a rectangular hole 5 formed in the strip.Portions 2 and 3 are both provided with a bore 6 which is internally threaded to receive a screw for clamping an electric cable inside the loop to establish electrical contact between the terminal and the cable.The curved outside surface of the terminal opposite the bore is provided with a silver layer 7 to form a contact surface. The area of strip covered with silver and also the thickness of the silver overlay depend on the magnitude of the electric current to be transmitted by the terminal.A method of making the terminal of, Figures 1 and 2 is illustrated by Figure 3. A flat rectangular sheet 9 of metal such as brass is provided with a continuous longitudinal surface layer of silver 8 of the thickness and width required for the layer 7 on the terminal. Layer 8 may be deposited on the flat surface of the sheet to form an overlay as shown in the drawings or it may be inlaid in the sheet, a groove of the required thickness and depth first being formed in the sheet and the silver then being deposited in the groove. The silver may be deposited by a known method, for example seam welding such that it is securely bonded to the sheet.Rectangular portions of one edge of the sheet are then punched out to form outwardly extending tabs 4 and rectangular holes 5 each corresponding to a tab 4 are punched out from the body of the sheet. The sheet is then cut along the broken lines shown in Figure 3 and the strips are folded upon themselves to acquire the cross section shown in Figure 1, the tabs 4 entering the holes 5. Bores 6 are then formed in the strips to produce terminals as shown in Figures 1 and 2.This procedure may of course be modified by depositing the silver layer after the punching operation.One application of the terminals described above is illustrated by Figure 4. A 2 way electric switch comprises a casing 11 within which are mounted three terminals 12a, 12b and 12c of the type described with reference to Figures 1 and 2. The terminals are provided with screws 13 to clamp exposed ends of current carrying cables within the terminals and are held within the casing by shoulders 14 on the casing walls. The terminals are separated from each other by interior walls 15.The switch mechanism comprises a curved rocking contact member 16 of metal which is provided on its outer surface with a layer 17 of silver similar to the silver layer on the terminals. The rocking member pivots about point 28 between the position shown in the drawing, in which terminals 12b and 12c are connected electrically by the rocking member, and an inverse position in which terminals 12a and 12b are connected in the same manner. The silver layers on the rocking member and terminals provide silver to silver contacts between the rocking member and the terminals. The switch is operated by means of switch member 18 which is pivotally mounted to rotate between extreme positions determined by abutment of the switch member edges 20 with s urfaces 21 of the casing one extreme position is shown in the drawing. The switch member has internal walls 22 enclosing a spring loaded plunger 23 which is urged against contact member 16 and can rotate about axis 19 to an extent limited by walls 22. Rotation of switch member 18 from one extreme position to the other causes contact member 16 to rotate similarly and member 16 is then held in its extreme position by plunger 23 to ensure good electrical contact with terminal 12a or 12c. This arrangement of switch member 18, plunger 23 and contact member 16 provides a bistable switch which is reliable in operation.The inside surface of member 16 is provided with upstanding tangs 24 which are engaged by walls 22 on rotation of switch member 18 before the plunger 23 passes its dead centre position opposite point 25. The first part of the rotation of member 16, in which contact between member 16 and a terminal is broken, is thus caused by wall 22 and not spring loaded plunger 23. The effect of this arrangement is to break contact relatively slowly and avoid the risk of an arc being formed between member 16 and the terminal when the current carried by the switch is alternating current.
