# Heat shield apparatus for a gas turbine.

## Abstract
Two concentric, partially overlapping annular plates 32, 40 mounted on a parallel support plate 50 are provided for partly defining gas flow path and for shielding bearings and other sensitive turbine parts from hot combustion gases in a radial flow gas turbine 10 . The radially outer plate 32 is cooled by compressed air channeled past the plate surface 66 opposite the combustion gases entering through a turbine inlet 22 . The compressed air from a source 62 is metered through channeling including holes 64 in the support plate 50 to achieve a temperature distribution decreasing in the radially inward direction for providing sealing contact between the outer plate edge 34 and the support plate outer periphery 56 . The radially inner plate 40 is cooled by film cooling using the compressed air exiting the outer plate channel 58 in the vicinity of an overlap between the inner peripheral edge 36 of the outer plate 32 and the outer peripheral edge 42 of the inner plate 40 .
