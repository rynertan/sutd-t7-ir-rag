# Torque variation absorbing device.

## Abstract
The torque variation absorbing device comprises a driving plate 2 , a flywheel 6 , and a spring mechanism 12 , a dumping and torque limiting mechanism 15 and a hysteresis mechanism 18 installed between the driving plate 2 and the flywheel 6 . The dumping and torque limiting mechanism 18 is located radially inside of the spring mechanism 12 and radially inside of an oil drain hole 25 bored in the flywheel 6 . The side plate 2d at one side of the driving plate 2 is bent toward the flywheel 6 and covers a gap 11 between the driving plate 2 and the flywheel 6 . The side plate 2c at the other side of the driving plate 2 is made of a steel plate and the load supporting points 23, 24 on both sides of the side plate 2c are spaced from each other in the radial direction.
