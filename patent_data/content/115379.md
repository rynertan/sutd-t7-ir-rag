## Description
ANTAGONISTS OF THE ANTIDIURETIC ACTION OF ARGININE VASOPRESS IN This invention relates to novel peptides which antagonize the antidiuretic and or vasopressor action of arginine vasopressin in vivo. Attempts to develop clinically useful synthetic antagonists of in vivo antidiuretic and or vasopressor responses to arginine vasopressin, the antidiuretic hormone ADH , have led to the synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of hundreds of analo gues of the neurohypophysial peptides, oxytocin and vasopressin. Analogues which can effectively antagonize the in vivo vasopressor responses to ADH have been reported byDyckes et al., J. Med. Chem., vol. 17 1974 at 250 Manning et al., J. Med. Chem., volume 20 1977 at 1228 Bankowski et al.. J. Med. Chem., volume 21 1978 at 850 Kruszynski et al., J. Med. Chem., volume 23 1980 at 364 and Lowbridge et al., J. Med. Chem., vol. 21 1978 at 313. Kruszynski et al. reported that 1 ss mercapto ss,ss cyclopentamethylenepropionic acid . 2 O methyl tyrosine arginine vasopressin and 1 ss mercapto ss,ss cyclopentamethylenepropionic acid arginine vasopressin are potent vasopressor antagonists, which also have very low antidiuretic potency. Manning et al. 1977 described the synthesis of tl deaminopenicillamine, 4 valine, 8 D arginine vasopressinsand Lowbridge et al. the synthesis of 1 i3 mercapto 13,J3 cyclopentamethylenepropionic acid , 4 valine, 8 D arginine vasopressin. Both of these compounds have reduced antidiuretic activity and are potent antagonists of the vasopressor response to AVP. Analogues of vasopressin or oxytocin which antagonize antidiuretic responses to ADH have been reported by Chan et al., Science, vol. 161 1968 at 280 and J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., vol. 174 1970 at 541 and vol. 196 1976 at 746 Nestor et al., J. Med. Chem., vol. 18 1975 at 1022 and Larsson et al., J. Med. Chem., vol. 21 1978 at 352. None of the compounds reported has been pharmacologically or clinically useful as an antidiuretic antagonist. The synthesis and evaluation of vasopressin analogues, incorporating etherified tyrosine at the 2 position, valine at the 4 position and D orL arginine at the 8 position, which antagonize the antiantidiuretic action of ADH in vivo, have been reported by Sawyer et al., Science, vol. 212 1981 at 49 andManning et al., J. Med. Chem., vol. 24 1981 at 701. Synthetic vasopressins have been disclosed in the following U.S. Patents 3,371,080 Boissonnas et al. 3,415,805 Siedel et al. 3,418,307 Boissonnas et al. 3,454,549 Boissonnas et al. 3,497,491 Zaoral 4,148,787 Mulder et al. Of these references, Boissonnas et al., 080, discloses that 2 phenyl alanine 8 ornithine vasopressin has a vasoconstrictive action equal to that of natural vasopressins but low antidiuretic activity. The remaining references disclose synthetic vasopressins having high or relatively specific antidiuretic activity. Synthetic modifications of oxytocin are disclosed byManning in U.S. Patents 3,691,147 and 3,700,652. It is therefore apparent that there is a continuing need for the development of pharmacologically and clinically effective antagonists of the antidiuretic action of arginine vasopressin. It is the object of the invention to provide novel antagonists of the antidiuretic action of ADH, which are effective in vivo. According to the invention, there are provided antagonists of the antidiuretic action of ADH, of the general formula EMI4.1 in which x is D or L Tyr R in which R is a methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl group , D Tyr, D Phe, D Val,D Leu, D Ile, D Arg, D Gln, D Asn, D NVa, D Nle, D Cha,D Abu, D Thr or D Met Y is D or L Cys W is D or L Pro, a3 Pro or HO Pro Z is D or L Arg, D or L Lys or D or L Orn and n is 4 or 5 provided that when X is other than D Gln or D Arg, W isPro, Y is Cys and Z is D or L Arg, n is 4 and when X is D or L Tyr R and n is 5, W is HO Pro or D Pro.

D Phe, D Val,D Leu, D Ile, D Arg, D Gln, D Asn, D NVa, D Nle, D Cha,D Abu, D Thr or D Met R is methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl and Z is or L Arg EMI5.2 wherein X and Z are as above and n is 4 or 5 EMI5.3 wherein X and n are as above and Z is D or L Lys or D or L Orn EMI6.1 wherein X and n are as above W is D Pro. Pro or HO Pro and Z is D or L Arg, D or L Orn or D or L Lys provided that, when X is D or L Tyr R and n is 5, W is HO Pro or D Pro and that when X is D Gln or D Asn, W is also Pro. This invention further relates to a method for antagonizing the in vivo response to ADH, comprising administering to an animal being treated an amount of one of the foregoing compounds, in admixture with a physiologically and pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, effective to antagonize the antidiuretic response to ADH.

Initial attempts to design an antagonist of the antidiuretic response to arginine vasopressin AVP included synthesis of 1 deaminopenillamine, 4 valine, 8 D arginine vasopressin dPVDAVP by Manning et al. 1977 , supra, and of l R mercapto B.B cyclopenta methylenepropionic acid , 4 valine, 8 fi arginine vasopressin, d CH2 5VDAVP , Lowbridge 1978 , supra. These analogues were designed by replacing the two hydrogens on the ss carbon at the l position of the highly active and selective antidiuretic peptide 1 deamino 4 valine, 8 D arginine vasopressin dVDAVP ,Manning et al., J. Med. Chem., vol. 16 1973 at 975, by two methylene groups and a cyclopentamethylene group, respectively.These substituents had previously been shown to convert the highly potent oxytocic agonist l deamino oxytocin dOT into potent antagonists of the oxytocic response to oxytocin, specifically, 1 deaminopenicillamine oxytocin dPOT and 1 ss mercapto ss,ss cyclopentamethylenepropionic acid oxytocin, d CH2 5OT. See, Hope et al., J. Biol.Chem., vol. 237 1962 at 1563 Schulz et al., J. Med.Chem., vol. 9, 1966 at 647 and Nestor et al., J. Med.Chem., vol. 18 1975 at 284. The discovery of the antidiuretic antagonists d CH2 5Try alk VAVP. Sawyer et al. 1981 , suPra,Manning et al., 1981 , supra, led to the synthesis of analogues having a cyclotetramethylene ring at the l position. It was found, in accordance with the present invention that the cyclotetramethylene analogues are comparable in activity to the corresponding 2 O alkyltyrosine B,8 cyclopentamethylen analogues. Tyrosine ethers within the scope of this invention include the various isomeric 1 4 carbon alkyl ethers, including propyl, isopropyl and various butyl isomers.Preferred compounds of the invention are Tyr Et ethers, particularly D Tyr Et compounds of Formulas II, III, IV and V, wherein Z, Z or Z is D or L Arg, D or L Lys or D or L Orn. Preferred compounds of Formula II are those wherein a x is D or L Tyr R b X is D Tyr R c R is ethyl, including each of a b d Z is Arg, including each of a c and e Z is D Arg, including each of a c . Preferred compounds of Formula III are those wherein a X is Tyr R b X is D Tyr R c R is ethyl, including each of a b d X is fi Phe e Z is Arg, including each of a d and f n is 5, including each of a e . Preferred compounds of Formula IV are those wherein a x is D or L Tyr R b X is D or L Tyr Et c x is D Ile d n is 5, including each of a c e Z is Orn, including each of a d and f Z is Lys, including each of a d . Preferred compounds of Formula IV are those wherein a x is D or L Tyr R b x is D or L Tyr Et c W is fl Pro, including each of a b d n is 5, including each of a c and e Z is Arg, including each of a d . The compounds of this invention are accordingly very effective antagonists of the antidiuretic response to ADH. They can therefore be used in pharmacological studies on the contribution of ADH to a variety of pathological states involving water retention. It is further contemplated that they could be effective and specific agents for treating the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of ADH, that is, theSchwartz Bartter syndrome or SIADH. This syndrome can complicate a number of disorders, including carcinomas, pulmonary diseases, intracranial diseases and head injuries, Bartter et al., Am. J. Med., vol. 42 1967 at 790. The compounds of this invention can be employed in mixtures with conventional excipients, i.e.physiologically and pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic carriers suitable for parenteral or other application, provided that the carriers do not interact deleteriously with the active compounds. Accordingly, the invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the invention in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, for example, water, salt solutions, alcohols, vegetable oils, polyethylene glycols, gelatine, lactose, amylose, magnesium stearate, talc, silicic acid, viscous paraffin, perfume oil, fatty acid monoglycerides and diglycerides, pentaerythritol fatty acid esters, hydroxymethyl cellulose, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, etc.The pharmaceutical preparations can be sterilized and, if desired, mixed with auxiliary agents, e.g., lubricants, preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, salts for influencing the osmotic pressure, buffers, colouring, flavouring and or aromatic substances, which do not deleteriously interact with the active compounds. For parenteral or intranasal application, solutions, preferably aqueous solutions, as well as suspensións, emulsions or implants, including suppositories, are particularly suitable. Ampoules are convenient unit dosages. The compounds of this invention are generally administered to animals, including but not limited to mammals, e.g. livestock, household pets, humans, cattle, cats and dogs. A diuretically effective daily dosage of the active compounds can be administered parenterally in a single dosage or as divided dosages throughout the day. Parenteral or intranasal administration is preferred. The compounds of this invention are particularly valuable in the treatment of humans afflicted with water retention of any etiology. In this regard, they can be administered in substantially the same manner as the known compounds oxytocin and vasopressin, to achieve their physiological effects. It will be appreciated that the actual preferred amounts of active compounds used will vary according to the specific compound being utilized, the particular compositions formulated, the mode of application, and the particular organisms being treated. Optimal application rates in a given set of conditions can be ascertained by those skilled in the art of using conventional dosage determination tests in view of the above guidelines. Preferred antidiuretic antagonists of this invention are those of Formula II wherein X is D O ethyl tyrosine and Z is D or L arginine. Without further elaboration, it is believed that one skilled in the art can, using the preceding description, utilize the present invention to its fullest extent.The following specific embodiments are, therefore, to be construed as merely illustrative and not limitative of the remainder of the disclosure in any way whatsoever.In the following Examples, the temperatures are set forth uncorrected in degrees Celsius.

EXAMPLE 4 1 ss Mercapto ss,ss cyclotetramethylenepropionic acid .2 O alkyltyrosine. 4 valinel L or D arainine vasopressin Compounds of this series were prepared as inExamples 1 3, to obtain protected intermediates for each analogue. The procedures of Bodanszky et al., J. Am.Chem. Soc., vol 81 1959 at 5688 and J. Or9. Chem., vol. 39 1974 at 444, employing a p nitrophenyl ester, facilitated by the use of hydroxybenzotriazole Konig et al., suPra , were used for the coupling of ss tS benzylmercapto ss,ss cyclotetramethylenepropionate in accordance with Nestor, suPra. The cyclotetramethylene propionate was synthesized by using cyclopentanone. The product melted at 66 67 C and, by thin layer chromatography benzene acetone had Rf 0.91. Each precursor was deblocked with sodium in liquid ammonia to produce a sulfhydryl compound. The latter compounds were oxidatively cyclized with potassium ferricyanide as in the preceding Examples. The analogues were desalted and purified by gel filtration on Sephadex G 15 by a two step procedure using 50 acetic acid and 0.2M acetic acid, respectively, as eluants. The purity and identity of each analogue was ascertained by thin layer chromatography in two different solvent systems, Kruszynski et al., supra.

Chem., vol. 17 1974 at 969. The values are expressed as pA2 values, defined as in Schild et al., Br. J. Pharmacol., vol. 2 1947 at 189. Activity as antidiuretic agonists was determined by intravenous injection of the compounds being evaluated in ethanol anesthesized water loaded rats in accordance with Sawyer, Endocrinology, vol. 63 1958 at 694.Antagonism of the antidiuretic response to subsequent injections of vasopressin was tested as described bySawyer et al., Science, vol. 212 1981 at 49. Antagonistic potencies were determined and expressed as effective doses and PA2 values. The effective dose is defined as the dose in nanomoles per kilogram that reduces the response seen from 2x units of agonist injected 20 min after the dose of antagonist to the response with lx units of agonist. Estimated in vivo pA2,, values represent the negative logarithms of the effective doses, divided by the estimated volume of distribution 67 ml kg .
