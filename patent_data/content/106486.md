## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO NOVEL OCTAHYDROBENZ f ISOQUINOLINES It has long been known that slight chemical modifications of the morphine molecule lead to analgesic agonists of widely differing potencies and addictive properties. For example, codeine, the methyl ether of morphine, is a relatively mild analgesic agonist having only slight dependance addiction probability. On the other hand, heroin, the diacetyl derivative of morphine, is a powerful agonist with extremely high addiction potential. In addition, as long ago as 1915, Pohl found that when the N methyl group of codeine was replaced with an allyl group, the resulting compound, N allylnorcodeine, was an opiate antagonist.In 1940, N allylnormorphine or nalorphine was synthesized and was shown to have a highly specific ability to reverse the depressant effects of morphine.Other simple chemical modifications of the morphine molecule have yielded many interesting drugs. Thus, one fruitful research area in the search for improved analgesics of high potency or lower addiction liability has been the chemical modification of the morphine molecule. In addition to chemically modifying the morpnine ring structure, chemists have developed a second related field of research the preparation of compounds containing only part structures of morphine with the same end in mind as above i.e., the synthesis of improved analgesic agonists and or analgesic antagonists of improved properties. For example, meperidine, a widely used analgesic, can be written as a morphine part structure, as can the benzomorphans and the prodines. Many other compounds of morphine partstructures have been prepared, some of which have improved analgesic agonist properties and others, particularly those with an allyl group attached to a ring nitrogen, which have opiate antagonist properties.It had been hoped that morphine part structure research would produce a compound having both opiate agonist and antagonist properties since the opiate antagonist property would assure a user that the compound would have a greatly reduced dependance liability. Two recently marketed analgesics, pentazocine and phenazocine, have been found to be both antagonists and agonists although they still retain a certain degree of opiate dependance liability. Recently, two groups have prepared isocuino line analogs of the prodines and or the benzomorphans.Menard, et al., Can. J. Chem., 52, 2316 1974 , prepared several octahydrobenz f isoquinolines which were reported to possess analgesic activity. All of the compounds prepared and tested were substituted at the lOb position with hydroxy or acyloxy. Ha nne, et al., Arch. Pharm., 312, 472 1979 , reported the preparation and analgesic activity of octahydrobenz fiisoguinolines which are not substituted in the benzene portion of the molecule. In accordance with the present invention, novel substituted octahydrobenz f isoquinoline derivatives are useful as analgesic agents, having both narcotic agonist and antagonist properties, as well as psychotropic characteristics. Accordingly, compounds of formula I EMI3.1 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in which R1 is hydrogen, C1 C4 alkyl, or C1 C12 alkanoyl R2 is C1 C4 alkyl, C2 C6 alkenyl, orEMI3.2 in which m is 1, 2, or 3 R3 is hydrogen, C1 C8 alkyl, C2 C6 alkenylmethyl, C3 C8 cycloalkyl methyl,EMI3.3 in which p is 0, 1, or 2 Y isEMI4.1 CH , รง , S , or NH , providing that when Y is O , S , or NH , p may only be 2, and providing that when Y isEMI4.2 p may not be 0 Z is O or S R5 is C1 C4 alkylthio, nitro, amino, trifluoromethyl, hydroxy, hydrogen, C1 C4 alkyl, C1 C4 alkoxy, or halo R6 is hydrogen, C1 C4 alkyl, C1 C4 alkoxy, or halo R7 is hydrogen or methyl and R4 is C1 C8 alkyl or hydrogen, are useful analgesic and psychotropic agents In a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a process for preparing a compound ofFormula I , or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, said process comprising a Reducing a compound of Formula II , EMI4.3 to form a compound of Formula I in whichR4 is hydrogen or, b Reacting a compound of Formula III ,EMI5.1 in which R1 is C1 C4 alkyl, with an organo metallic reagent to form a compound of Formula I , in which R4 is C1 C8 alkyl or, c Reducing a compound of Formula III to form a compound of Formula I in which R4 is hydrogen or d Hydrolysis or reduction of a compound of Formula I in which R1 is C1 C4 alkyl or Cl Cl2 alkanoyl, to form a compound in which R1 is hydrogen or, e Acylation or alkylation of a compound of Formula I in which R1 is H, to form a compound of Formula I in which R1 is alkanoyl or alkyl or f Treatment of a compound of Formula I , in which R3 isEMI5.2 where W is C1 C4 alkyl, benzyl or phenyl, with a base to form a compound of Formula I in which R3 is hydrogen or, g Reacting a compound of Formula I in which R3 is hydrogen, with an alkyl halide, or acyl halide followed by reduction, to form a compound of Formula I in which R3 is other than hydrogen and, h if desired, salifying a product of any of reactions a g . The term C1 C8 alkyl refers to straight and branched alkyl radicals of one to eight carbon atoms and includes methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, tertbutyl, hexyl, octyl, and includes the terms C1 C4 alkyl and tC2 C4 alkyl 1. The term C2 C6 alkenyl refers to straight and branched alkene radicals of two to six carbon atoms such as vinyl, allyl, 4 methyl 3pentenyl, or 5 hexenyl. The term C2 C6 alkenylmethyl refers to straight and branched alkene radicals of two to six carbon atoms attached to a methyl radical, such as 2 propenyl allyl , 2 butenyl, 3 butenyl, or 2pentenyl. The term C3 C8 cycloalkyl methyl refers to a methyl radical substituted with saturated alicyclic rings of three to eight carbon atoms, such as cyclopropylmethyl, methylcyclopropylmethyl, cyclobutylmethyl, cyclopentylmethyl, cyclohexylmethyl, 1 , 2 , 3 , or 4 methylcyclohexylmethyl, or cycloheptylmethyl, cyclooctylmethyl. The term XCl C4 alkoxy refers to the straight and branched aliphatic ether radicals of one to four carbon atoms such as methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, butoxy, isobutoxy, sec butoxy, or tertbutoxy. The term Cl Cl2 alkanoyl refers to straight and branched aliphatic acyl radicals of one to twelve carbon atoms, such as formyl, acetyl, propionyl, pentanoyl, 4 butyloctanoyl, or lauroyl. The term halo refers to fluoro, chloro, bromo, and iodo. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts, including quaternary ammonium salts, of the amine bases represented by the above formula are formed with acids, and include, for example, salts derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, nitrous acid, or phosphorous acid, as well as salts derived from organic acids including aliphatic mono and dicarboxylic acids, phenyl substituted alkanoic acids, hydroxy alkanoic and alkanedioic acids, aromatic acids, aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids.Such pharmaceutically acceptable salts may include sulfate, pyrosulfate, bisulfate, sulfite, bisulfite, nitrate, phosphate, monohydrogenphosphate, dihydrogenphosphate, metaphosphate, pyrophosphate, chloride, bromide, iodide, fluoride, acetate, propionate, decanoate, caprylate, acrylate, formate, isobutyrate, caprate, heptanoate, propiolate, oxalate, malonate, succinate, suberate, sebacate, fumarate, maleate, mandelate, butyne 1,4 dioate, hexyne 1,6 dioate, benzoate, chlorobenzoate, methylbenzoate, dinitrobenzoate, hydroxybenzoate, methoxybenzoate, phthalate, terephthalate, benzenesulfonate, toluenesulfonate, chlorobenzenesulfonate, xylenesulfonate, phenylacetate, phenyl propionate, phenylbutyrate, citrate, lactate, ss hydroxy butyrate, glycollate, malate, tartrate, methanesulfonate, propanesulfonate, naphthalene l sulfonate, or naphthalene 2 sulfonate. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are those salts useful in the chemotherapy of warm blooded animals. The usual nonreactive solvents used in the preparation of the salt from the base include acetone, tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, or ethyl acetate.Quaternary salts can be prepared in generally the same way by reaction of the base with an alkyl sulfate or alkyl halide, for example, methyl sulfate, methyl iodide, ethyl bromide, or propyl iodide. The inorganic acid salts, especially the hydrochloride salts, are preferred. The preferred compounds of this invention are those in which a R1 is C1 C4 alkyl, especially methyl, b R1 is hydrogen, c R2 is methyl, d R2 is n propyl, e R3 is hydrogen, f R3 is C C alkyl, especially methyl, g R3 is C2 C6 alkenylmethyl, especially 2 propenyl allyl , h R3 is cyclopropylmethyl, i R3 isEMI8.1 especially 2 phenylethyl, and j R4 is hydrogen. Especially preferred are those compounds wherein R1O is at the 9 position of the molecule. The bridgehead substituents, the hydrogen at 4a and R2 at lOb can have either a cis or trans relationship to one another i.e., the two substituents can be on the same side of the octahydroisoquinoline ring system cis or on opposite sides trans . In addition, both the 4a and lOb carbon atoms are asymmetric, thus giving rise in each compound to 4 optical isomers, occurring as two optical isomer mixtures designated as the cis dl and the trans dl pair.Formula I is thus intended to comprehend both the optical isomers, the cis dl and trans dl mixtures, and their individual enantiomorphs since, as far as is known, all of the individual isomers and isomer mixtures are useful as psychotropic agents and as analgesic agonists or as analgesic antagonists, albeit large quantitative differences in agonist or antagonistic potency may exist between individual isomers or racemates. Those compounds of Formula I which are in the cis configuration, however, are preferred ire., the cis dl pair and the individual cis isomers such as the cis l and cis d compounds. Where R4 is other than hydrogen, an additional chiral center is present both possible isomers and their mixture are contemplated by this invention. The novel compounds of this invention are prepared according to scheme I Scheme IEMI10.1 In scheme I, R2 and R3 are the same as described earlier, R 1 is C2 C4 alkyl or C1 C12 alkanoyl, and W is C1 C4 alkyl, benzyl, or phenyl. A methoxy l tetralone A is converted to the corresponding methoxy l hydroxy 1 methyl l ,2,3, 4 tetra hydronaphthalene B by treatment with a methyl Grignard reagent in the usual manner. Treatment of the hydroxy intermediate B with a dehydrating agent, such as polyphosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, or p toluenesulfonic acid in a solvent such as benzene, xylene, toluene, or the like with the concurrent removal of water, usually at elevated temperatures, results in the loss of water and the formation of a methoxy l methyl 3,4 dihydronaphthalene C . Aminomethylation of the latter intermediate with two equivalents of formaldehyde, and the appropriate R3 amine gives a methoxy 3 R3 substi tuted 1,2,3,4,5,6 hexahydrobenz f isoquinoline D which is the required intermediate for all subsequent transformations. Treatment of the methoxy 3 R3 substituted 1,2,3,4,5,6 hexahydrobenz I f isoquinoline D with a strong base, such as n butyl lithium, sodium amide, or methyl lithium, in a compatible solvent, such as ethers, tetrahydrofuran, alkanes, such as hexane, and the like1 preferably at low temperatures, for instance 0 C. to 780C., followed by the addition of the resulting anion to a solution of the desired R2 halide, results in the preparation of the corresponding methoxy lOb R2 substituted 3 R3 substituted l, 2, 3,5,6,10b hexa hydrobenzffjisoquinoline E . Suitable R2 groups are those as defined earlier, and suitable halide groups may include chloro, bromo, and iodo. Thus, suitableR2 halides for the above reaction may include methyl bromide, n butyl iodide, isopropyl chloride, ethyl bromide, 5 hexenyl bromide, or methyl iodide. Reduction of the hexahydro derivative above to the corresponding methoxy l0b R2 substituted 3 R3 substituted 9 methoxy 1,2,3,4,4a,5,S,lOb octahydro benz f isoquinoline F may be accomplished by any of a number of methods well known to those skilled in the art. More specifically, the reduction may be accomplished by reaction with hydride reagents such as sodium borohydride, diborane, lithium aluminum hydride, or sodium bis 2 methoxyethoxy aluminum hydride1 either on the compound in its free base form, or on a suitable salt, such as the perchlorate salt. The hydride reduction reactions are generally carried out in the presence of a suitable solvent, for example ethers such as diethyl ether, dipropyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, diglyme, or in alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, or isopropanol. Weak acids, such as formic acid or acetic acid may be added to the reaction mixture if desired, thereby making the reduction more efficient. A preferred reduction method, for example, comprises treating the hexahydro derivative with sodium borohydride in the presence of a suitable solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran, and in the presence of an acid such as acetic acid. This reaction gives predominantly the preferred cis compounds of this invention. The amount of reducing agent used can vary over a wide range. Generally, the amount of reducing agent used is in excess of the hexahydro derivative, normally from about 1 to about 10 molar excess however, more or less can be used if desired. The reaction is usually carried out at a temperature below about 1800C., although the precise temperature is not critical. Preferably, the reactants are mixed while the temperature is maintained at about 0 to about 20 C. After the reactants have been combined, the temperature can be increased preferably to a temperature from about 50 to about 1500C. Normally, the reduction is complete within about 1 to about 4 hours.The product can be recovered by making the reaction mixture alkaline, for example by adding an aqueous base such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, or ammonium hydroxide and extracting the aqueous alkaline reaction mixture with a water immiscible organic solvent, such as diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, or dichloromethane. The reduction of the hexahydro compound E can be accomplished alternatively by hydrogenation.The hydrogenation is carried out preferably in an unreactive solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, ethanol, methanol, water, or N,N dimethylformamidQ, under neutral, acidic, or basic conditions. The particular solvent used is not critical, but preferably the solvent selected is one in which the hexahydro derivative will be at least partially soluble. The hydrogenation is carried out in the presence of a suitable catalyst such as Raney nickel, platinum oxide, platinum, or palladium on a suitable carrier such as carbon or barium sulfate. The particular reaction conditions are not critical to the process, but generally the hydrogenation is carried out at a temperature of about 250 to about 2000C., with a hydrogen gas pressure of about 20 to about 100 p.s.i.The particular catalyst used in the reaction can determine to some degree the particular octahydro isomer obtained.When the hydrogenation is carried out in the presence of palladium on carbon, for example, the octahydro compound is predominantly the cis isomer. Mixtures of cis and trans compounds can be separated, if desired, by any of the commonly used techniques such as distillation, gas liquid chromatography, high pressure liquid chromatography, solid liquid chromatography, or crystallization. In this manner, the compounds in which R1 and R3 are both methyl are prepared. These compounds are also useful as intermediates for preparing the other compounds of this invention. For instance, compounds of structure G are prepared by the cleavage of the methoxy group to the corresponding phenol using known methods such as hydrobromic acid and acetic acid, or boron tribromide, for example. Such methods of ether cleavage are well known to those in the art see for example U.S. Patent No.3,324,139. The phenol compounds are useful as analgesic agents and additionally serve as intermediates to C1 C4 alkylether derivatives. These phenols may be alkylated with C1 C4 alkyl halides in which C1 C4 alkyl and halide are as defined earlier optionally in the presence of an acid binding agent, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, triethylamine, or magnesium hydroxide, to give the appropriate R 1substituted 3 methyl 10b R2 substituted product H .Typically, equimolar quantities of the phenol and the alkylating agent are stirred together, preferably in a non reactive solvent, including amides such as dimethyl formamide or dimethylacetamide, or sulfoxides such as dimethyl sulfoxide at temperatures from about 0 C. to the reflux temperature of the solution, preferably at about ambient temperature. The alkanoyl derivatives are similarly prepared by the action of an appropriateC1 C12 alkanoyl halide on the phenol in like manner to also provide compounds of structure H. Alternatively, the appropriate methoxy 3 methyl 10b R2 substituted 1,2,3,4,4a,5,6,10b octahydro benz f isoquinolines F, R3 is methyl may be demethylated to the corresponding 3 hydrogen compound K by treating compound F with a haloformate to provide a carbamate J, W is Cl C alkyl, benzyl, or phenyl which gives a secondary amine K when treated with a base. This type of reaction is described in more detail by Abdel Monen and Portoghese, J. Med. Chem., 15, 208 1972 . In particular a haloformate such as, for example, phenyl chloroformate, ethyl bromoformate, or benzyl chloroformate is reacted with a tertiary amine, for example a 3 methyl isoquinoline derivative in the present case, to afford a carbamate.The reaction is generally carried out in an unreactive solvent such as dichloromethane, chloroform, acetone, or ethyl acetate. The temperature is usually held below about 2000 C., and the reaction is substantially complete within about 1 to 5 hours. The product carbamate J can be isolated by simply evaporating the reaction solvent, and further purification of the product is generally not needed. The carbamate J is converted to the 3 hydrogen compound by the action of a suitable base such as aqueous sodium hydroxide or aqueous potassium carbonate. A suitable organic solvent is normally added to the reaction mixture in order to dissolve the carbamate. Suitable solvents may include alcohols such as ethanol or methanol, or ethers such as dioxane or tetrahydrofuran.The hydrolysis reaction is generally complete within about 12 to 36 hours when carried out at a temperature of about 500 to about 1500C. The product may be isolated by extracting the aqueous reaction mixture with a suitable solvent such as diethyl ether or methylene chloride. The unsubstituted compound K can be further purified by methods such as chromatography, crystallization, or distillation. These 3 hydrogen compounds K are useful analgesic agents and also may be transformed into the corresponding methoxy 3 R3 substituted lOb R2 sub stituted 1,2,3,4,4a,5,6,10b octahydrobenzrflisOquir.o lines L in the usual manner, or the methoxy func tionality may be cleaved to the phenol M using hydrobromic acid acetic acid. The phenol M may then be alkylated at the 3 position with a R3 halide as before to yield N and subsequently alkylated at the phenol position with a R l halide to give O if desire. The alkylation of a phenol derivative R1 is hydrogen and most of the 3 hydrogen derivatives R3 is hydrogen may be performed in the usual manner with the appropriate alkyl halide reagents in the presence of an acid binding agent. The reactants are generally mixed in about equimolar quantities, preferably in an organic solvent. Typical solvents commonly used include amides such as dimethylformamide or dimethylacetamide or sulfoxides such as dimethyl sulfoxide. Generally, a base is added to the reaction mixture to act as an acid binding agent. Typical bases include sodium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate, magnesium hydroxide, or triethylamine.The alkylation is generally complete after about 1 to about 16 hours when carried out at a temperature of about 20 to 120 CC. The products are isolated by general methods and further purified if desired. If both R1 and R3 are hydrogen, the 3 position will be selectively alkylated with one equivalent of halide, although alkylation at the phenol position will occur if more than one equivalent of halide is employed. The introduction of certain R3 substitutents may additionally be accomplished by treating the 3hydrogen derivative with an appropriate acyl halide, followed by reduction of the resulting carbamate. This process may be used when there is to be a methylene group adjacent to the nitrogen atom. For instance, C3 C8 cycloalkyl methyl compounds may be formed by using a C3 C8 cycloalkyl carboxylic acid halide, followed by reduction. The 2 phenylethyl functionality may be introduced by using a phenylacetyl halide, followed by reduction. Typically, the carboxylic acid chloride is used, usually in the presence of an acid scavenger, such as triethylamine or sodium bicarbonate, in a compatible solvent, such as benzene, dimethylformamide, or dioxane.The carbamate intermediate may be isolated and reduced to the methylene compound with, for instance, lithium aluminum hydride in tetrahydrofuran. In a similar manner, the R3 substituents in which Y isEMI18.1 may be transformed into the corresponding alcohol and methylene compounds by partial or total reduction of the ketone. In Scheme I, all four methoxy tetralones A are commercially available and thus give the corresponding methoxy compounds of this invention F . This provides, through cleavage to the corresponding phenol and subsequent alkylation or acylation, an efficient synthesis to R 1 substituted compounds of this invention. As will be obvious to those skilled in the art, other alkoxy tetralones may be used as starting materials in this sequence to give the corresponding compounds of this invention directly. The hydroxy or acyloxy congeners of A cannot be utilized as starting materials because side reactions will occur. Scheme I describes the preparation of those preferred compounds of this invention in which R4 is hydrogen. In the preferred sodium borohydride reduction of the compounds of Structure E, the salt form ofE, especially the perchlorate salt, is usually employed.This provides for the following Scheme II Scheme IIEMI19.1 Treatment of E with acid shifts the double bond to the iminium compound Q which on treatment with sodium borohydride gives F as previously described.Alternatively, Q may be reacted with a Grignard reagent R4MgX or lithium reagent R4Li in which R4 and X are the same as previously defined, in the usual manner, to give the 4 R4 substituted compounds of this invention S .

The compounds of this invention are valuable psychotropic and analgesic agents for treating animals suffering from pain. The analgesic potencies of the compounds of Formula I are comparable to that of meperidine as demonstrated, for instance, in the standard mouse writhing assay. The compounds are not morphine like when tested in mice, and have demonstrated narcotic antagonist like properties. The analgesic activity of a number of compounds provided by this invention has been determined in the standard rat tail jerk assay and the mouse writhing assay. Writhing, characterized by contraction of the abdominal musculature, extension of the hindlegs, and rotation of the trunk, was induced in Cox standard strain albino male mice. The mice, weighing 18 24 grams, were fasted overnight and given the test compound by gavage in an acacia suspension 5 sixty minutes before writhing was induced by the intraperitoneal administration of acetic acid 0.60 percent .Each treatment group consisted of 5 mice. The total number of writhes for the treatment group was determined during a 10 minute observation starting 5 minutes after acetic acid administration. Control groups had a total of 40 60 writhes per observation period. Table I shows typical test results obtained with the claimed compounds. The results in the mouse writhing assay are presented as the effective dose in mg. kg. of the tested compound required to inhibit induced writhing in the test animals by fifty percent ED50 . Results are presented in Column II for both subcutaneous s.c. and oral p.o. administration of the test compound as compared to the reference compound meperidine.

Such formulations are useful in the treatment of pain in warm blooded animals.The formulations contemplated comprise an analgesicallyeffective dose of a compound of the invention in combination with any of a number of pharmaceutical diluents, excipients and carriers. Typical diluents commonly used in such formulations may include lactose, sucrose, starch, micro crystalline cellulose, calcium sulfate, or sodium benzoate. Typical formulations will contain from about 1 to about 30 percent by weight of active ingredient. The formulations can be compressed into tablets or encapsulated in gelatin capsules for convenient oral administration. Alternatively, the formulations can be dissolved in sterile water or saline and placed in a suitable vial for convenient intravenous or intramuscular administration. The compounds of the invention have demonstrated valuable analgesic activity, and therefore are useful in the treatment of pain. The invention thus further provides a method for imparting analgesia in an animal which comprises administering an analgesically effective dose of a compound of the invention. Typical doses commonly administered will range from about 0.5 to about 150 mg. per kg. of animal body weight. A preferred dose will be from about 1.0 to about 50 mg. kg. The method of treatment can be accomplished by administering an analgesic compound of the invention via the oral or parenteral routes. Preferred routes of administration include the oral and intramuscular routes. Subcutaneous administration of the suitably formulated active compounds can also be utilized when desired. As an illustration of the contemplated method of treatment, a formulation comprising about 50 mg. of 1,2,3,4,4a,5,6,10b octahydro 9 methoxy l0b n propylbenz f isoquinolin hydrochloride dissolved in about 1 ml. of saline is administered from 1 to 4 times daily to a subject suffering from pain and in need of analgesic treatment.
