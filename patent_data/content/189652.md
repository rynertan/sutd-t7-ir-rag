# Synchronous AC motor.

## Abstract
A synchronous ac electrical motor comprising A a stator 20 having a body slotted 30 , soft ferromagnetic, low eddy to produce a rotating magnetic field, an excitation coil 32 energizable with single phase ac located in two adjacent slots with a pole piece between them, and feedback windings 33 located in slots such that when ac potential therefrom is conveyed to the excitation coil the excitation ac is modified to a selected phase and magnitude to improve the pull in torque of the motor, a capacitor 94 containing circuit connecting the feedback windings and the excitation coil, the body of ferromagnetic material having a cylindrical surface, and the improvement characterized in that B a rotor 40 has three major components electrically and magnetically associated, 1 first being an exterior layer 52 low electrical conductivity magnetizable permanent magnetic material having an outside cylindrical surface complementary to that of the stator, 2 a high permeability, low eddy current component 44 to which the first layer is attached, and 3 the third component 48 being a supporting body of ferromagnetic material of high permeability and high elec trical conductivity on which the second component and first layer are fixedly supported. The third component can be a solid ring of steel, for example, or it can be a laminated core containing shorted electrical conductors. In starting from standstill, the power windings and energized with ac power and this produces a circulating electrical current with the third component of the rotor which reacts to produce rotational torque. After the rotor reaches about 70 to 80 of synchronous speed, the excitation coil is energized and this will produce strong alternating magnetic flux in the pole piece 34 which magnetizes the layer of the permanent magnetic material into a pattern of north and south magnetic poles in the proper phase with the rotating field of the stator so as to produce a powerful rotational torque that acceler ates the rotor to a predetermined synchronous speed.
