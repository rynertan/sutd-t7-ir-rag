The compounds of formula I are capable of forming acid addition salts with therapeutically acceptable acids. The acid addition salts may be prepared by reacting the base form of the appropriate compound of formula I with one or more equivalents, preferably with an excess, of the appropriate acid in an organic solvent, for example, di ethyl ether or an ethanol diethyl ether mixture.These salts, when administered to a mammal, possess the same pharmacologic activities as the corresponding bases. For many purposes it is preferable to administer the salts rather than the base compounds. Examples of suitable acids to form these salts include the common mineral acids, e.g., hydrohalic, sulfuric or phosphoric acids the organic acids, e.g., formic, acetic, maleic, malic, citric, or tartaric acid and acids which are sparingly soluble in body fluids and which impart slow release properties to their respective salts, e.g., pamoic acid, tannic acid or carboxymethyl cellulose. The addition salts thus obtained are the functional equivalent of the parent base compound in respect to their therapeutic use.Hence, these addition salts are included within the scope of this invention and are limited only by the requirement that the acids employed in forming the salts be therapeutically acceptable. The discovery in the mid 1960 s of two major dopamine DA systems indicated that this neurotransmitter exerted control over a number of physio logical functions. Against this background an interest arose to develop DA receptor agonists to study the function of the dopaminergic systems and to evaluate these agonists as possible therapeutic agents in Parkinson s disease and certain neuroendocrine disorders, for example, hyperprolactinemia, galactorrhea, amenorrhea, impotence, hypertension and other central nervous system disorders. The DA receptor agonists exert a variety of pharmacological effects, some of the most characertistic being the ones that occur in animals in whichDA deficiency is brought about to mimic the Parkinsonian syndrome. An important model was developed by U. Ungerstedt, Acta. Physiol. Scand., Suppl. 367, 6993 1971 who, by means of unilateral injections of 6 hydroxydopamine 6 OHDA into the DA pathway, could produce selective lesions of the ascending DA pathways on one side of the brain. Ungerstedt 1971 demonstrated in these lesioned rats that DA receptor agonists induced rotational behavior towards the innervated side. The response is due to the development of receptor supersensitivity in the denervated striatum resulting in a higher degree of DA receptor activity on the denervated as compared to the innervateb side after treatment withDA receptor agonists.Due to this imbalance between the two sides, a rotational behavior is elicited, the direction being always towards the less activated side. It is of interest that in the discovery of the DA receptor stimulating properties of bromocriptine, the 6 OHDA rotational model was utilized tH. Corrodi et al., J. Pharm. Pharmacol., 25, 409 412 1973 1. In the test for rotational behavior in rats following the unilateral 6 OHDA induced destruction of one nigrostriatal pathway, the method described by C.J. Pycock and C.D. Marsden, Europ. J. Pharmacol., 47,167 1978 was followed. The rats 230 250 g were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital 40 mg kg i.p. and intracerebral injections were made using a Stoelting stereotaxic instrument, C.H. Stoelting Co., Chicago, Ill., U.S.A. . Unilateral injections of 6 OHDA hydrobromide 8 lug 3 Ill delivered at a rate of 1 1 per min were made into the ascending median forebrain bundle MFB in the lateral hypothalamus according to the coordinates of the De Groot brain atlas, J. De Groot,Verhandel, Koninkl. Ned. Akad. Wetenschap.Natuurk. 52 1 40 1959 , A 4.6, L 1.9, V 2.7 . 6 OHDA was made up in ice cold distilled water containing 0.2 mg ml ascorbic acid. Three weeks after operation, the rats were tested for rotational behavior in response to apomorphine hydrochloride 0.25 mg kg, s.c. . Rats which consistently showed more than 5 turns min after apomorphine were selected and the compound of formula I was then administered. The rat was immediately placed in the rotometer, described by K. Voith and J.R. Cummings, Can. J.Pharmacol., 54, 551 1976 , and the rotation was continuously recorded until drug effect subsided. By using this test, the following compound of formulaI is an effective dopamine receptor agonist the amount of the compound, route of administration and total turns S.E. standard error during the time observed are indicated in the parenthesis 2 4 2 hydroxy 2 3,4 dim ethoxyphenyl ethyl l piperazinylj 2,4,6 cyclobeptatrienA one described in Example 19, at a sub cutaneous dose of 5 mg kg exhibited 2233 607 turns in a four hour duration and 2 4 2 hydroxy 2 3,4 dimethoxyphenyl ethyl 1 piperazinyl 2,4,6 cycloheptatrien l one hydrochloride described in Example 19, at an oral dose of 10 mg kg exhibited 1649 298 turns in a six hour duration and at an oral dose of 20 mg kg exhibited 5167 1065 turns in an eight hour duration . A recently developed animal model, described by G.P. Smith andR.C. Young in Advances in Neurology , Vol. 5, F.H. McDowell and A. Barbeau,Eds., Raven Press, New York, pp. 427 432 1974 , shows that rats exhibit almost complete akinesia in an open field following the bilateral injection of 6 OHDA into the anterolateral hypothalamus. The troponylpiperazines of formula I are able to reverse this 6 OHDA induced hypokinesia and as a result, function as dopamine receptor agonists. In this test for dopamine receptor agonis ts, the compounds of formula I exhibit a pharmacological response that is quantitatively comparable to that of apomophine and bromocriptine. Experiments were performed on male SpragueDawley rats housed in air conditioned quarters. The room was lighted between Q700 and 1900 hr daily and was maintained at a temperature of 240 C 20 C. The method of Smith and Young, cited above, was followed. Rats approximately 280 g were operated on under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia.Using a Stoelting stereotaxic instrument, the tip of a 26 gauge cannula was positioned in the anterolateral hypothalamus 7 mm anterior to the interaural line, 2 mm lateral to the midline and 8 mm below the dura according to theDe Groot brain atlas, noted above. Via a polyethylene tubing PE 20 the cannula was connected to a 10 yl syringe which was mounted in a Starrett micrometer head drive, C.H. Stoelting Co., Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A. All injections were bilateral. Each injection consisted of 4 p1 of distilled water containing 6 OHDA 6.5 pg base yl and ascorbic acid 0.4 pg pl . The animals had free access to Purina Laboratory Chow pellets and tap water. However since anterolateral hypothalamic 6 OHDA injections produce aphagia and adipsia, intragastric feeding was necessary in order to prevent drastic weight loss. The rats received a daily gastric intubation of 2 g of the modified rat tube feeding diet ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cleveland,Ohio, U.S.A. mixed with approximately 2 ml tap water. Ambulation in the open field was evaluated in an apparatus consisting of a wooden box 69 cm x 69 cm x 42 cm with.an arborite floor. The floor was divided into 36 squares 11.5 cm x 11. 5 cm . The placement of all four limbs in one square was taken as one ambulation score. In the present experiments all compounds were evaluated four days after the intracerebral injection of 6 OHDA. The rat was placed into the center of the open field and observed for a 2 min period. Only rats with almost total akinesia were used. Apomorphine, bromocriptine or the compounds of formulaI were injected s.c. to groups of 4 12 rats. Subsequently, the number of squares were counted which the animal entered during several 2 min observation periods.Apomorphine was evaluated at 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min bromocriptine at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 hr and the compounds of formula I at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min after injection. Each animal was used only once. The results are expressed as cumulative number of ambulation scores which are the sums of the scores obtained during the 2 min observation periods. The following substances were used apomorphine hydrochloride Macfarlan Smith Ltd.,Edinburgh, Scotland , bromocriptine CB 154 SandozPharmaceuticals, East Hanover, N.J., U.S.A. and 6 OHDA hydrobromide AldrichChemical Co., Inc., Milwaukee, Wisconsin, U.S.A. . The compounds were dissolved in distilled water or suspended in distilled water with a few drops of polysorbate 80 Tween 80 Tween is a registered trade mark . If the compound was an oil, 0.4 ml of dim ethyl sulfoxide was added. Solutions were prepared fresh on the day of the experiment. The 6 OHDA solution was kept in ice throughout the injection procedure. All doses refer to the base. Using the above described method, apomorphine at a dose of 0.5 mg kg exhibited a score of 135 41 and bromocriptine at a dose of 10 mg kg exhibited a score of 112 23.

The above described test method for dopamine receptor agonists shows that the compounds of formula I are active as dopamine receptor agonists.The compounds, thus, can be used clinically in the treatment of hyperprolactinemia, galactorrhoea, amenorrhoea, impotence, diabetes, Parkinsonism, acromegaly, hypertension and other central nervous system disorders which respond to dopamine receptor stimulation. The compounds of formula I of this invention are used alone or in combination with pharmacologically acceptable carriers, the proportion of which is determined by the solubility and chemical nature of the compound, chosen route of administration and standard biological practice. For example, they are administered orally in solid form i.e. capsule or tablet. They can also be administered orally in the form of suspensions or solutions or they may be injected parenterally. For parenteral administration they can be used in the form of a sterile solution containing other solutes, for example, enough saline or glucose to make the solution isotonic. The tablet compositions contain the active ingredient in admixture with non toxic pharmaceutical excipients known to be suitable in the manufacture of tablets. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients are, for example, starch, milk sugar, certain types of clay and so forth. The tablets can be uncoated or they can be coated by known techniques so as to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. The aqueous suspensions of the compounds of formula I contain the active ingredient in admixture with one or more non toxic pharmaceutical excipients known to be suitable in the manufacture of aqueous suspensions.Suitable excipients are, for example, methylcellulose, sodium alginate, gum acacia, lecithin and so forth. The aqueous suspensions can also contain one or more preservatives, one or more colcring agents, one or mo. e flavoring agents and one or more sweetening agents. Non aqueous suspensions can be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example, arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil, or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin, and the suspension may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. These compositions can also contain a sweetening agent, flavoring agent and antioxidant. The dosage of the compounds of formula I as dopamine receptor agonists will vary with the form of administration and the particular compound chosen. Furthermore, it will vary with the particular host as well as the age, weight and condition of the host under treatment as well as with the nature and extent of the symptoms. Generally, treatment is initiated with small dosages substantially less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under circumstances is reached. In general, the compounds of this invention are most desirably administered at a concentration level that will generally afford effective results without causing any harmful or deleterious side effects. For example, the effective dopamine receptor stimulating amount of the compounds for i.p.administration usually ranges from about 0.1 mg to about 250 mg per kilogram body weight per day in single or divided doses although as aforementioned variations will occur. However a dosage level that is in the range of from about 1.0 to about 100 mg per kilogram body weight per day in single or divided doses is employed most desirably for i.p. administration in order to achieve effective results. For oral administration, effective amounts can range from about 1.0 to about 250 mg per kilogram body weight per day in single or divided doses preferably about 5.0 to 100 mg per kilogram body weight per day. The compound of formula I, or a therapeutically acceptable salt thereof, also can be used to produce beneficial effects in the treatment ofParkinsonism, hyperprolactinemia and related disorders when combined with a therapeutically effective amount of an agent commonly used in the treatment of Parkinsonism, hyperprolactinemia and related disorders.Such agents include, for example, apomorphine and its derivatives, piribedil and its derivatives, dopaminergic ergot derivatives, especially bromocriptine and lergotrile, 2 amino 6 ,7 dihydroxyg1,2,3 ,4 tetrahydronaphthalene ADTN , levodihydroxyphenylalanine levodopa , combination of levodopa with carbidopa, I prolyl Irleucylglycinamide MIF and its derivatives, especially Gprolyl N methyl D leucylglycinamide pareptide , biperiden, cycrimine hydrochloride, procyclidine, trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride, benztropine mesylate, chlorphenoxamine hydrochloride, diphenhydra mine hydrochloride, orphenadrine hydrochloride, ethopropazine hydroxy chloride and the enzymes, monoamine oxidase B and catechol O methyl transferase.A combination of the foregoing agents can be substituted for a single agent.Suitable methods of administration, compositions and dosages of the agents are well known in the art for instance, Physican Desk Reference , 32 ed.,Medical Economics Co., Oradell, N.J., U.S.A., 1978.

The desired R3 group is then introduced on to the other nitrogen of this protected piperazine various methods of introducing this group are described hereinafter. Subsequent removal of the protecting group, e.g. hydrogenation in the case of benzyl, gives the corresponding piperazine derivative of formula III wherein R3 is other than hydrogen. With reference to reaction scheme 1, the 2 aikoxy tropone of formula II in which R1 is as defined herein and R8 is lower alkyl, preferably methyl or ethyl, is condensed with the piperazine derivative of formula III in which R2 and R3 are as defined herein to obtain the corresponding compound of formula I in which R1, R2 and R3 are as defined immediately above.The condensation is readily effected by heating a solution of the compound of formula II with one to five, preferably 1.3 to 2.0, molar equivalents of the piperazine of formulaIII in an inert organic solvent, for example, a lower alkanol, benzene, chloroform, acetonitrile, toluene and the like, preferably methanol or ethanol, at 50 to 1000C for 10 to 60 hours and isolating the corresponding compound of formula I.

In.this condensation, it should be noted that the condensation of the compound of formula I in which R3 is hydrogen with 2 bromoethylk1,3 dihydro 2H isoindol 1,3 dione gives a separable mixture of the compound of formula I in which R1 and R2 are defined herein and R3 is 2 4, 5 dihydro2 oxazolyl benzoyl or 2 1,3 dihydro l, 3 diox2H isoindol 2 yl ethyl.For this condensation, suitable proton acceptors can be selected from organic and inorganic proton acceptors, for example triethylamine, pyridine,N ethylmorpholine, sodium bicarbonate, sodium or potassium carbonate, sodium or potassium lower alkoxide and the like.
