# JACQUARD FLUID CONTROLLER

## Abstract
Disclosed is a Jacquard control system for controlling fluid flow within an apparatus such as a downhole tool. Such Jacquard control system includes at least one control member having a plurality of holes therethrough, the holes being arranged in a plurality of patterns cooperable with fluid passageways within the downhole tool. Each pattern of holes permits fluid flow within the downhole tool to carry out a desired function. Also included is a device to selectively adjust the position of the at least one control member relative to the fluid passageways to permit the fluid flow to carry out the desired functions. A downhole fluid sampler and tester is disclosed which includes a Jacquard control system, for withdrawing fluid from a subterranean forma tion determining at least one property of the withdrwan fluid, such as EH, pH, temperature, pressure and resistivity, and, if desired, obtaining a sample of the withdrawn fluid.
