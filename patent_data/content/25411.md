# Mounting means for a roller.

## Abstract
The roller according the invention is suitable for use with an endless belt conveyor or the like. Known rollers for conveyors are disadvantageous in that in the event of a roller or shaft being damaged, the entire roller must be replaced. This can be a time consuming operation. The roller 10 according to the invention is mounted between end supports providing bearing 16 comprising a shield 18 for each bearing. Each shield comprises a convex cup shaped formation for engagement in a recess 20 in each roller end wall 22 . The cup shaped formation defines an annular skirt 24 adapted to house a conventional roller bearing 16 coupled to the end support by way ofashaft 26 . A washer 28 is provided on the shaft 26 between the shaft 26 and a dust cover 30 . With this arrangement the roller may readily be removed when a damaged roller must be repaired.

## Description
A ro lerThis invention relates to a roller. The invention is more particularly, but not exclusively concerned with 2 roller suitable for use with an endless belt conveyor or the like. Ynon rollers for conveyors,include those having a substantally cylindrical body provided with a central bore and a shaft in the bore, supported at its ends on a frame. This arrangement is disadvantageous in that in the event of a roller or shaft being damaged, the entire roller must be replaced. This can be a timeconsuming operation. t is an object of the invention to provide a roller with which the above disadvantage of known arrangements is at least minimised.According to the invention,a roller mounted between end supports providing bearings is characterised in a shield for each bearing, the shields and end walls of the roller providing relatively rotatable inter engaging formations.In a preferred form of the invention each shield comprises a substantially convex cup shaped formation for engagement in a recess in each roller end wall, the cup shaped formation defining an annular skirt adapted to house a conventional roller bearing coupled to the end support by way of a shaft. t will, however, be understood that alternative arrangements are possible. For example, each shield may comprise a substantially concave cup shaped formation for engagement with a substantially convex protrusion on each roller end wall.A rollcr assembly incorporating a roller according to the invention will generally include a substantially U shaped frame providing a horizontal web and a pair of arms exten dinp upwardly in use. The end supports for the rollers are suitably provided on the frame so as to define an assembly in which one medially located horizontal roller extends bet ween end supports secured to the web and each of a pair of de rollers arc secured at their one end to the arms of the frame and at their other csnd to end supports on the horizontal web.Further according to the invention each shaft is coupled at its end remote from the bearing to a removable link mounted on the end supports. The link may comprise a spigot in the nature of a bracket provided with an aperture at its one end for receiving the shaft, its end remote from the aperture being adapted to be housed in a socket in the nature of a scabbard fast with the end supports.Preferably the bracket is of substantially triangular cross sectional configuration, at least in its region remote from the aperture, to improve the strength thereof.It will be understood that the inter engaging formations may be covered by a layer of protective material such as rubber or the like to reduce wear. l ith this arrangement the roller may readily be removed by way of the links on the end supports when a damaged roller must be repaired. Furthermore, if the roller itself has not been damaged, the damaged component, such as the shield or the bearing, may readily be replaced.The invention will now be described by way of illustration only with refercnce to the acconpanying drawings in which Figure 1 is an exploded diagrammatic representation of the relatively rotatable components of a roller accor ding to the invention andFigure 2 is a diagrammatic front elevation of an assembled roller according to the invention,illustrating a portion of the support frame for the rollers.Referring to the drawings,a roller 10 is mounted between end supports 12 and 14 providing bearings 16. Each bearing 1 is provided with 2 shield 18 comprising a substantially convex cup shaped formation for engagement in a recess 20 in each roller end well 22. The shields 18 and end walls 22 of the roller 10 provide relatively rotatable inter engaging formations.The cup shaped formations define an annular skirt 24 adapted to house the roller bearings 16. The bearing 16 is coupled to the end support by way of a shaft 26, a washer 28 is provided on the shaft 26 between the shaft 26 and a dust cover 30 for protecting the relatively rotatable components of the roller assembly.Each shaft 26 is coupled at its end remote from the bearing 16 to a removable spigot in the nature of a bracket 32 mounted on the end supports 12 and 14. The bracket 32 is provided with an aperture at its one end for receiving the shaft 26 and the end of the bracket 32 remote from the aperture is adapted to be housed in a socket in the nature of a scabbard 34 fast with the end supports 12 and 14. The inter engaging formations on the shields 18 and the end walls 22 of the roller may be covered by a layer of protective material such as rubber or the like to reduce wear.In the completed conveyor belt roller assembly, a portion of which is illustrated in Figure 2, a second horizontal roller will be attached to the support frame 36 by way of a second pair of end supports of which only one, designated 38, is illustrated. The pair of end supports 38 are spaced from the end supports 12 and 14 with respect to the longitudinal axis through a series of support frame structures 36. A third roller is provided in the completed roller assembly on each frame 36 in an in line disposition relative to the roller illustrated in Figure 2, the support and third roller being in mirroramage relationship with respect to the portion of the assembly illustrated in Figure 2. A series of such roller assemblies comprise the support for an endless belt conveyor. With this arrangement the roller may readily be removed by way of the links on the end supports when a damaged roller must be repaired. Furthermore, if the roller itself has not been damaged, the damaged component such as the shield or the bearing, may readily be replaced.Following variations are provided a the engagement formation on the bearing shield is pre ferably in the form of a frusto cone , and the mating formation at the ends of the roller are similarly pro filed.b relative rotation between the bearing shield and roller is preferably prevented by means of protrusions on the shield which engage in mating recesses in the ends of the roller. It w 11 be appreciated that many others variations which differ in matters of detail alone from that of the above disclosure are possible.
