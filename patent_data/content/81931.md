## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Pipe fabricated from thermoplastic resins such as polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride is used in large volume.Such pipe is used, however, largely if not almost exclusively in small diameters. The art has recognized that large diameter thermoplastic pipe, i.e., pipe having internal diameters of 36 inches or larger, could be used for drainpipe and other applications where large diameter concrete and clay pipe are presently used. One of the factors that has limited the market acceptance of large diameter thermoplastic pipe is the difficulty of sealing sections of such pipe together to form liquidtight joints. Accordingly, there is a need in the art for improved methods of joining sections of such large diameter thermoplastic pipe together to form liquid tight joints.

SUb2ZARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a method for preparing liquid tight seals between sections of large diameter thermoplastic pipe. The method includes the steps of a Pressing two sections of pipe together to form a nonliquid tight joint between said two pipe sections, b Directing a stream of hot gas against a section of the contiguous faces of the two pipe sections which form the joint prepared in step aj so as to heat said contiguous faces to at least their softening point, c Spraying a stream of finely divided thermoplastic resin particles through a hot gas and into the zone defined by the contiguous faces heated in step b so as to melt said resin particles and seal said zone with melted resin, d Terminating the spray of melted resin into said zone and permitting the melted resin to solidify, and e Repeating steps b , c , and d until the entire joint formed in step a is filled with resin.The pipe sections employed will have a minimum internal diameter of at least 24 inches and a wall thickness of at least about 1 8 inch. The resin particles employed will be a resin which readily forms a fusion bond with the resin from which the pipe sections are fabricated. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Fig. 1 shows a sectional view of a large diameter thermoplastic pipe section of the type that can be joined by the method of the present invention. The pipe section will have a minimum length of 10 feet, a minimum internal diameter of 24 inches, and a minimum wall thickness of about 1 8 inch.More typically, the pipe section will have a length of approximately 20 feet and can have an internal diameter at least as large as 144 inches. The main pipe section 20 has an integral female bell joint section 21 on one end and a male spigot joint section 22 on the other end. Sections of large diameter thermoplastic pipe of the type employed in the practice of the present invention typically will weigh at least 600 pounds. When such pipe sections are stored in stacked relationship, they sometimes can be distorted so that a cross section thereof is not completely round. This phenomenon is illustrated in Fig. 2 in which section 20 of the pipe is shown to be distorted out of round so as to have a slight egg like cross section. The dashed line 20a indicates the configuration that the pipe would have if it were truly round. The amount of distortion shown inFig. 2 is exaggerated for purposes of illustration. Fig. 3 illustrates the manner in which two sections of pipe of the type shown in Fig. 1 are fitted together. The female bell joint 21 of one pipe section fits around and encompasses the male spigot joint 22 of an adjoining pipe section. Ideally, the fit between the two joints should be sufficiently tight so that face 22a of the spigot joint is in touching relationship with face 21a of the bell joint around the entire annulus of the joint. By reason of the possible distortion of the pipe out of its ideal round configuration, as illustrated in Fig. 2, a gap must be provided between faces 21a and 22a. This is one of the factors which gives rise to the difficulty in providing liquid tight seals between sections of large diameter thermoplastic pipe. The face 21b of the bell joint and face 229 of the spigot joint 22 define an annulus 23.A second and connecting annulus 23a is defined by faces 21a and 22a. The assembly shown in Fg. 3 could be sealed to form a liquid tight joint by sealing either annulus 23 or 23a. By reason of their weight, the pipe sections must be placed in their use site before being sealed. In most applications, the pipe will be partially buried before being sealed. This necessitates sealing the pipe from its interior. Accordingly, sections of the annulus 23 will be heated with a hot gas to at least soften faces 21tow and 22. A stream of molten resin droplets then will be sprayed into the heated annulus and allowed to solidify to seal the joint. One means for heating the sections is illustrated in Fig. 6. A worker 30, standing within the pipe, directs the flame from a flame spray gun 32 along an arcuate section of the annulus 23. After the arcuate section of the annulus 23 is heated to at least the softening point of the walls 21b and 22b, small droplets of melted polymer are sprayed into the heated section of the annulus 23 by means of the flame spray gun 32. At the completion of these steps, and after permitting the melted polymer to cool, the arcuate section 23 is filled with solidified polymer 24 which seals the joint. The above steps are successively repeated until the worker 30 has completely filled the annulus 23 with polymer 24.After the annulus 23 has been completely filled with polymer 24 as illustrated in Fig. 4, it is preferred practice to heat the sealed area with hot gas and spray molten polymer over the heated area to form a second layer of polymer 25. Preferably, layer 25 should be extended beyond the edges of annulus 23 as illustrated in Fig. 5. Fig. 7 illustrates a flame spray gun of the type that can be employed in the practice of the present invention.The gun 32 includes a handle 34 having the general shape of a pistol grip. The main body section 35 of the apparatus includes a central chamber 36, an annular chamber 37, and a second annular chamber 38. Each of the chambers is supplied by external supply lines 40, 42, and 44 each of which is provided with flow control valves 41, 43, or 45. In operation, a combustible gas such as propane is fed to chamber 37 from an external source via line 42, and an oxidizing gas, either air or oxygen, is fed to chamber 38 from an external source via line 44. After ignition, the flow of the two gases will be controlled to provide a stable, conically shaped flame 60.When the flame spray gun is employed to fill annulus 23 with melted polymer 24, the flame spray gun 32 is operated in the mode illustrated in Fig. 8. In this mode, the combustible gas oxidizing gas mixture is burned to form the flame 60 as previously described. A stream of fine thermoplastic resin particles is blown in to and through central chamber 36 via line 40 by a suitable carrier gas such as air or nitrogen.Upon entering flame 60, the resin particles 62 are in the solid state. This is noted in Fig. 8 by showing the resin particles as small open circles In passing through the flame, the resin particles are heated sufficiently to melt them and form molten droplets 64. This change of state is shown by illustrating the melted droplets of resins as small filled circles. The hot gases from the flame will be directed against the faces of the joint to le sealed. In the view illustrated in Fig. 3, the hot gases enter annulus 23 and a portion of the hot gases also flow into annulus 23a. When the melted resin droplets 64 shown in Fig 8 are blown into annulus 23, a portion of the resin droplets also flow into an annulus 23a and seal a portion thereof as shown in Fig. 4.Depending upon the proximity of the tip of flame 60 to annulus 23, it sometimes is observed that some melted resin droplets 64 flow completely through annulus 23a and solidify on the exterior surface of pipe section 20. Figs.9 and 10 show a form of apparatus that can be employed to carry out the method of the invention in a semiautomatic manner. A main frame 100 is supported and positioned by three wheels 102, 104, and 106. The wheels are atached to telescoping extension legs 102a, 104a, and 106a which can be moved in and out of chambers 102b, 104b, and 106b by means not shown. The wheels are adjusted so that tubular main support member 110 best seen in Fig. 11 is centrally positioned within the pipe section. The wheels of course also serve to move the apparatus along the length of the pipe sections. A handle 101 is provided to assist in moving the apparatus. A support brace 107 is rigidly positioned on main frame 100. As best seen in Fig. 11, the tubular main support member 110 is mounted on and supported by brace 107. A mounting ring 108 is supported on the main support member as illustrated in Figs. 11 and 12. The mounting ring 108 has a series of four hydraulic cylinders 112 mounted thereon only two of which are seen in Fig. 10. Piston arms 114 extend from cylinders 112 and press arcuate shaped feet 115 against the interior wall of the pipe to prevent the apparatus from moving while the pipe joint is being sealed. One foot 115 also is shown in a partially retracted position as 115a. By reason of the ability to control the extended length of legs 102a, 104a, and 106a and the extended length of piston arms 114, the apparatus can be employed to seal sections of pipe having a range of internal diameters. A sprocket wheel 120 is seated by a flange 122 in a recess cut into support member 110. The sprocket wheel rides on a bearing 121. A flame spray gun carrier plate 130 is attached to the sprocket wheel 120 by suitable fasteners.A drive motor 140 having a sprocket wheel 142 attached to its shaft is mounted on the main frame 100. A chain drive 143 running over sprocket wheels 120 and 142 rotates the spray gun carrier plate 130. Two flame spray guns 150 and 152 are mounted on carrier plate 130 through openings 131 and 132.The carrier plate is rotated in the direction shown by the arrow in Fig. 10. A combustible gas is fed through lines 160 and 162 to supply the leading flame spray gun 150. A suitable rotating swivel 161 is provided to accommodate the rotation of carrier plate 130. Air or oxygen is supplied by suitable lines and a swivel not shown. In a like manner, a combustible gas, air or oxygen, and a stream of finely divided resin particles are fed to the trailing flame spray gun by suitable lines and swivels one operative assembly being shown as 164, 165, and 166. The combustible gas, the air or oxygen, and the finely divided resin particles are supplied from external sources by suitable lines two of which are shown as 170 and 172 which are attached to the apparatus by couplings 171 and 173. An electrical line 175 supplies power to motor 140. In operation, the apparatus is wheeled into proximity with the annulus 23 that is to be sealed. While being moved, the arcuate feet 115 will be withdrawn from their touching relationship with the interior wall of the pipe. If not previously adjusted, the wheel legs 102a, 104a, and 106a will be retracted or extended so that the main support member 110 is centrally positioned within the pipe. The flame of the leading spray gun 150 will be lit briefly to establish that the apparatus is properly positioned so that the flame is aligned with the annulus 23 that is to be sealed. The flame then is extinguished and arms 114 are extended so that arcuate feet 115 press against the interior of the pipe to hold the apparatus in a fixed position during the sealing operation.The wheels 102, 104, and 106 also are locked by means not shown. The motor 140 then is turned on so that sprocket wheel 120 is rotated. The leading flame spray gun 150 is lit and heating of annulus 23 is initiated. At the time that the trailing flame spray gun 152 is rotated under a section of the annulus that has been heated, it is lit and hot droplets of melted resin are sprayed into the heated annulus 23. As the flame spray guns 150 and 152 are rotated at a fixed speed, the melted resin cools quickly after it is sprayed into annulus 23. By visual inspection, the operator within the pipe can readily tell when the annulus is completely filled with resin and sealed. If minor voids are noted in the seal, they can be sealed with a hand held flame spray gun as described earlier herein. After the joint is sealed, the arcuate feet are withdrawn from contact with the interior pipe surface by retracting arms 114 into cylinders 112. The apparatus then can be moved to seal the next joint in the pipe train. The method of the invention can be employed to manufacture manholes from two sections of large diameter pipe one pipe section having a larger diameter than the other. Referring to Fig. 13, the smaller diameter pipe section 202 is fitted horizontally into a section of larger diameter pipe 200. Pipe section 202 is mounted in pipe section 200 through two carefully positioned and sized cuts made in pipe 200 so that the pipe section 202 fits snugly therein. The areas where the wall of pipe section 202 abuts with the cut in pipe section 200 are sealed at both the interior and exterior sections of the wall of pipe section 200.A bead or weld line 206 is formed on the exterior surface and a bead or weld line 208 is formed on the interior surface the weld lines being best seen in Fig. 15. An opening 204 is cut in the top section of pipe 202 to receive fluids entering pipe section 200. The bottom section of pipe section 200 is appropriately sealed by means not shown. The method of the invention can be employed to seal joints of pipe fabricated from. a wide variety of thermoplastic resin. Best results are obtained when the pipe is fabricated from a resin having a relatively broad softening point or melting point range and a high melt viscosity at the softening point. High molecular weight, high density polyethylene is the resin of choice. The finely divided resin particles should be of a resin type that readily forms a fusion bond with the resin from which the pipe sections are fabricated. Ideally the resin particles should be par tides of the resin from which the pipe sections are fabricated.
