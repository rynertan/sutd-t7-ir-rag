## Description
An inducible DNA replication cell division coupling mechanism in Escherichia coli. Cel division is a tightly regulated periodic process. In steady state cultures of Enterobacteriaceae division takes place at a well defined cell mass and is 2 strictly coordinated with DNA replication . In wild type Escherichia coZi the formation of DNA less cells is a very rare event3, and interruptions of DNA replication cause cause an arrest of cell division 6. The molecular bases of this replication division coupling has been elusive but several models have been proposed.It has been suggested, for example, that the termination of a round ofDNA replication may trigger a key event requisite to cell division . A quite different model postulates the existence of a division inhibitor which prevents untimely division and whose synthesis is induced to high levels when DNAreplication is perturbed9. The present invention establishes the existence of the latter type of replication division coupling in E. ccli and shows that the sfiA gene product is an inducible component of this division inhibition mechanism, synthesized at high levels after perturbations of DNA replication.DNA replication cell division coupling and the SOS response. A large body of evidence points to the induction by DNA damaging treatments of a number of manifestations, collectively termed the SOS response reviewed in refs 10 12 . These include the appearance of new DNA repair and mutagenic activities, massive synthesis of the recA protein, lytic development of certain prophages in lysogenic strains and filamentous growth division inhibition in non lysogens. The recA and lexA functions are required for the induction of all aspects of the SOS response. Mutant alleles of either locus can entirely prevent induction recA , lexA or cause gratuitous expression at 42 of certain aspects of the SOS response tif at the recA locus, tsl at the lexA locus . Incubation of tif or tsl strains at 42 results in the formation of long, multinucleate filaments.This filamentous growth, although not associated with detectable DNA damage, ultimately results in loss of viability. The involvement of an inducible protein in division inhibition is suggested by two observations.First, tif bacteria exposed briefly to high temperature form filaments on subsequent incubation at 300, whereas if protein synthesis is inhibited by the presence of chloramphenicol during the heat pulse cell division is not inhibited on return to 300 and removal of chloram phenicol13. Second, normal division can be restored in tsl bacteria at 42 by the presence of the RNA polymerase inhibitor rifampicin at a concentration too low to block bulk protein synthesis .If one could show that there is indeed a protein whose presence results in the inhibition of cell division and whose synthesis is induced by expression of the tif and tsl mutations and by perturbations of DNA replication as well, then this protein could justifiably be considered an inducible division inhibitor and the existence of the second mechanism of replication division coupling mentioned above would be established.The recA protein, synthesized at high levels after inducing treatments, was suspected of being such an inducible division inhibItor . It has been shown, however, that it has a purely regulatory role and is not involved in the actual process of division inhibition in wild type cells recovering from UV irradiation normal division resumes in the presence of a high concentration of recA protein15, and in tsl strains division inhibition can occur at 420 in the total absence of recA protein or in 13 the presence of the low uninduced level The filamentous growth induced in tif or tsl strains at 420 is completely suppressed by sfiA and sfiB mutations, whereas other aspects of the SOS response are 16 unaffe.cted by these mutations ,17 The sfiA and sfiB loci thus define elements specifically involved in the filamentation process as mediated by expression of the tif and tsl mutations. Previous studies have shown that sfi dependent division inhibition also occurs during thymine starvation13. In the study of sfi dependent filamentation the lon mutation1 has proved an invaluable tool. It greatly amplifies SOS associated division inhibition without affecting other manifestations of the SOS response. E. coli K12 lon mutants or wild type E. coZiB, a naturally occuring lon isolate stop dividing afterDNA damaging treatments too mild to block DNA replication and the cells grow into multinucleate aseptate filaments 9 identical in appearance to those formed by tif mutants at high temperature.Since this filamentation rapidly leads to loss of viability, lon strains are hypersensitive to treatments that perturb DNA replication18 and to tif or tsl expression16 20. In all cases the hypersensitivity is suppressed by sfiA and sfiB mutations16,17,21,22, indicating that sfi dependent filamentation occurs after all DNA damaging treatments known to induce the SOS response.Isolation of a sfiA lacZ operon fusion. The invention aimed at identifying the inducible element apparently involved in tif and tslmediated filamentations. As mentioned above, it is not the recA protein. Attention was given to the sfi genes, whose products are indispensable for division inhibition in tif and tsl strains at 420 and in lon strains following mild inducing treatments. To obtain accurate quantitative measurements of the rates of sfi gene expression under various conditions the powerful method of operon fusion was chosen, using the phage Mu d Ap, lac to ink the structural gene for S galactosidase lacZ to the promoter of the operon whose regulation is to be studied23, in the present case a sfi operon. The phageMu d Ap, lac , like its parent Mu 1, can insert its DNA at random locations in the host chromosome.Near one extremity of thephage genome are the lacZ and lacY genes, lacking a promoter. The phage genome is so constructed that, when inserted in a host operon in the proper orientation, the lac genes of the prophage can be expressed from the adjacent bacterial promoter their level of expression then reflects the level of expression of the bacterial operon in which the prophage is integrated. The Mu d Ap, lac prophage further confers ampicillin resistance on its host, permitting ready selection of lysogens. To isolate Mu d Ap, lac insertions at sfi loci, a Sfi phenotype in a lon strain was selected, taking advantage of the hypersensitivity of the strain to low concentrations of nitrofurantoin24. LysogenicSfi clones were selected from a Mu d Ap, lac infected lon culture on plates containing ampicillin and nitrofurantoin. These were purified, checked for UV resis.tance to confirm the Sfi character and analysed genetically. All Sfi clones carried a sfiA mutation, cotransducible with pyrD by P116,21,22. For most isolates the introduction by transduction of the Sfi character was invariably accompanied by loss of the Mu d Ap, lac prophage these strains thus harboured a single Mu d Ap, lac prophage, located at the sfiA locus and conferring a Sfi phenotype. Strains of this type having a significant basel level of S galactosidase were considered to have the lac genes fused to the sfiA promoter. One such fusion was used to study the inducibility of sfiA gene expression by DNA damaging treatments and its regulation by various genes known to control the filamentation response.This particular Mu d Ap, lac insertion, in addition to suppressing lon linked filamentation, was also shown to suppress lethal filamentation in tif and tsl strains at 420, and again this Sfi phenotype was indissociable from the presence of the Mu d Ap, lac prophage.Inducibility of sfiA gene expression. The effect of thymine starvation on sfiA expression was investigated in a thyA sfiA lacZ fusion strain. The differential rate of B galactosidase synthesis under these conditions quickly increases 20 to 40 fold fig. 1A, Table 1 reaching about 0.5 of total protein synthesis. Thus the sfi dependent filamentation normally observed during thymine starvation is correlated with a large increase in the rate of sfiA gene expression. A dose of 10 J m2 W radiation similarly causes a rapid 20 to 40 fold increase in the differential rate of B galactosidase synthesis fig. 1B, Table 1 . Nalidixic acid, a specific inhibitor of DNA gyrase, and methyl methanesulfonate, a DNA alkylating agent, also induce high rates of sfiA gene expression Table 1 .Nitrofurantoin induces sfi dependent filamentation in lon strains although its primary target of action is unknown, it, too, induces a high rate of sfiA gene expression Table 1 . A Mu d Ap, lac prophage inserted in the gal operon does not lead to UV inducible galactosidase synthesis Table 1 , showing that the inducibility observed in the sfiA lacZ strains depends on the sfiA location of the prophage. The conclusion derived from the above facts is that perturbations ofDNA replication induce a high level of expression of the sfiA gene. A similar pattern of induction has been reported for the recA gene and the din genes27,28. Induction of X prophage development or of mutations is widely used in tests to screen for potential carcinogens29, 30 It is clear that sfiA gene expression is significantly stimulated by inducing treatments too mild to cause X prophage induction for example, 1 J m2 UV irradiation, 2 pg ml nitrofurantoin . The ss galacto sidase levels in appropriate sfiA lacZ fusion strains thus provides a more sensitive indicator of induction of the SOS response.Genetic regulation of sfiA gene expression. The effect on sfiA gene expression of mutations known to suppress or enhance sfi dependent filamentation was studied next. recA and lexA mutations completely suppress tif and lon dependent filamentation31 33. Furthermore, cultures of recA or lexA mutant strains contain an abnormally high proportion of DNA less cells, and this proportion increases dramatically during thymine starvation, although the DNA containing cells in the population do filament under these conditions3 35 36. In recA or lexA derivatives of the sfiA lacZ fusion strains no W induction of 6 galactosidase synthesis is observed in the dose range 1 10 J m2 cf. Table 1 .These same recA and lexA mutations introduced into a gal lacZ fusion strain do not affect the inducibility of 8 galactosidase synthesis by galactose, and the capacity of these highly UV sensitive strains to synthesize S galactosidase is not seriously reduced by 10 J m2 UV irradiation Table 1 . The recA and lexA gene products are thus regulators of sfiA gene expression, most likely at the transcriptional level. Expression of the recA and din genes depends similarly on the recA and lexA gene products28 36, and in the case of the recA gene, regulation has been shown to be at the transcriptional level27,37. The tif mutation in the recA gene causes constitutive expression of most functions at 42 36538, including sfi dependent filamentation16. This expression is strongly enhanced by the presence of adenine and suppressed by the presence of guanosine plus cytidine in the medium38 39. In a tif sfiA lacZ fusion strain a high rate of ss galactosidase synthesis is induced at 420 in the presence of adenine but not in the presence of guanosine plus cytidine fig. 2A,Table 1 . No similar induction is observed in a tif gal lacZ fusion strain at 420 in the presence of adenine Table 1 . The tsl mutation in the lexA gene causes sfidependent filamentation and massive synthesis of the recA protein at 420 without concomitant induction of 17,36 140 other manifestations of the SOS response . In a tsl sfiA lacZ fusion strain a high level of ss galacto sidase synthesis is induced at 420 fig. 2B, Table 1 .Furthermore, induction by expression of the tsl mutation, unlike all other inducing treatments known, does not depend on recA activity in tsl strains carrying the recA1 missense mutation filamentation still occurs at 142 1 and large quantities of mutant recA 36 protein are synthesized36. In a tsl recA1 sfiA lacZ fusion strain a high level of ss galactosidase synthesis is still observed at 420 fig. 2C, Table 1 . It has been shown that tsl mediated filamentation can be suppressed by the presence in the growth medium of 4 pg ml of the RNA polymerase inhibitor rifampicin, although this concentration has only a slight inhibitory effect on total protein synthesis15.This suggests that the synthesis of some component of the filamentation response is abnormally sensitive to rifampicin inhibition. In the sfiA lacZ fusion strain ss galactosidase synthesis, normally well induced by 0.25 methyl methanesulfonate, was 69 inhibited by 4 pg ml rifampicin whereas total protein synthesis was inhibited only 12 . Thus transcription of the sfiA gene is more sensitive to rifampicin inhibition than that of theaverage E. ccli gene. The sfiB mutations completely suppress tif , tsl and lon dependent filamentation16,17,21,22. A sfiB mutation, however, in contrast to the recA and lexA mutations, has no inhibitory effect on tif mediated or nalidixic acid induced sfiA gene expression date not shown . The sfiB gene product is thus unlikely to be a regulator of sfiA gene expression. It may be involved in the action of the sfiA gene product, being either a second inducible component of the division inhibition mechanism or the constitutively expressed target site at which septation is inhibited. The fact that at least one sfiB mutation results in a 6 growth 17 disadvantage suggests constitutive expression. All the above experiments were carried out in genetically sfiA strains, indicating that the sfiA gene product, unlike the recA protein, is not needed for its on induction. The lon mutation amplifies sfi dependent filamentation, sensitizing the cell to small doses ofDNA damaging treatments. The degree of sensitization depends strongly on the growth tedium, being most severe in complex media18. At least seven different enzymes involved in cell wall biosynthesis are present at higher levels in lon strains than in lon strains and in one case, that of the gal operon, the lon mutant has been reported to have increased transcription rates To test whether the sensitization to filamentation reflects a higher level of expression of the sfiA gene in lon strains, the induction of sfiA gene expression by UV irradiation was compared in lon and lon sfiA lacZ fusion strains growing in complex medium.No difference in basal level or induction kinetics was revealed between the two strains cf. Table 1 . Thus the lon function does not seem to be a transcriptional regulator of the sfiA operon. Since lon mutants are also deficient in the Deg protease 1414 activity , it is tempting to speculate that this protease is normally involved in eliminating excess sfiA protein, permitting a rapid resumption of cell division as soon as normal DNA replication is restored.A DNA replication cell division coupling mechanism. The regulation of the SOS response is fairly well understood, at least in the case of prophage induction.DNA damaging treatments of X lysogens result in proteolytic cleavage of the X repressor145. The same cleavage 146 can be produced in Vitro by purified recA protein . Since the presence in a cell of recA protein, even at high concentrations, is not in itself sufficient to cause induction of A, several authors have hypothesized thatDNA damaging treatments may result in the formation of signal molecule which activates the recA protein to its protease forum 7 9. The nature and origin of such a signal molecule, however, remain speculative.It was previously shown that induction of the SOS response by expression of the tif mutation involves the DNA replication complex since the induction can be suppressed by modifications of the dnaB protein5 this suggests that the replication complex may be involved in the generation of the putative signal molecule. The induction of 880 prophage by a variety of treatments has been shown to occur simultaneously with DNA degradation at the replication fork, suggesting that the hypothetical signal molecule may be single stranded DNA or oligonucleotides produced by this degradation51. The lexA gene product may well be similar to a prophage repressor. Genetic evidence indicates that the lexA protein is a negative regulatory element governing the SOS response. The mutations called lexA modify the protein in such a way as to prevent induction of SOS functions, even in the presence of lexA protein52 they are thus analogous to the ind mutation in the Aci repressor gene, which prevents repressor cleavage45.Recent biochemical evidence has shown that the lexA protein like the A repressor, is cleaved in vivo and in vitro by activated recA protease, whereas a lexA mutant protein is insensitive to this cleavage53. Mutations which completely inactivate the lexA protein have also been described. These are the spr mutations514 and, presumably, the temperature sensitive tsl mutation 40 Inactivation of the lexA protein causes high level expression of the recA36 and sfiA genes and in sfi strains lethal filamentation140,55. The simplest model accounting for these observations is that the lexA protein directly represses the recA and sfiA operons and possibly others as well , although more complex regulatory circuits cannot be ruled out. Whatever the precise regulatory mechanism may be, the results presented here show that a high rate of sfiA gene expression is induced very rapidly during thymine starvation or after UV irradiation fig. 1 . The sfiA gene thus provides a highly sensitive link coupling cell division to DNA replication by the following sequence of events. Perturbations or alterations of the DNA replication complex cause the generation of a signal molecule which activates the recA protein to its protease form. The recA protease then cleaves the lexA protein, leading to high level expression derepression of the sfiA operon. Finally, the high concentration of sfiA protein thus produced results in an inhibition of cell division, which may serve to prevent the formation of DNA less cells after minor perturbations of replication.In this sense the sfiA gene product can be considered an inducible division inhibitor.

The invention further concerns the use of the recombinant obtained from any of the sfi genes hereabove referred to and of the gene encoding for ss galactosidase for the transformation of suitable microorganism, particularly E. coZi. The ss galactosidase gene may be replaced by any other gene coding for an enzyme liable of being dosed, when the expression of said Sfi genes is caused to be induced, such as the enzymes encoded by the UVR A gene, the reca gene, the umuC gene, etc. The invention further concerns the use of the so transformed microorganism for the testing of the mutagenic power cf substances suspected to possibly induce deterioration of cell DNA, to thereby cause the induction of the above mentioned SOS response, accordingly of the expression of said sfi genes. The method then comprises detecting the enhancement of the production of thedosable enzyme under the above defined conditions.The detection method of the mutagenic properties of any given substance then comprises cultivating said transformed microorganism in a medium suitable for its growth, such as the L medium when the microorganism is an E. coZi, sequentially in the absence and then in the presence of said substance, whereby the mutagenic properties thereof, if any, will be revealed by an increase of the amount of the dosed enzyme or hybrid protein encoded for by said recombinant An alternative of the method also comprises running comparatively two cultures of said transformed microorganism under identical conditions, except that the medium of one of said cultures shall be supplemented with the substance to be tested. The difference, if any, observed in the dosage results is then representative of the mutagenic power of the tested substance.Obviously the method is also applicable to the measuring of the reduction of mutagenic power that is liable of being caused by a drug principle expected to counteract the action of a reference substance. having known mutagenic properties on the DNA of the cultivated cells, in the presence of both the mutagenic substance and the drug principle. Advantageously the microorganism used, particularlyE. ocli will itself comprise mutations that will increase its sensitivity in the tests, particularly mutations affecting other genes known to be inducible in those instances where the DNA tends to be deteriorated by any substance penetrating in the cell, in order to favor the response of the sfi genes. These mutations shall advantageously affect simultaneously the UVR A, UVR B loci and the ADA locus. Furthermore it is desirable that a mutation further affects a gene, such as the RFA gene, which is known to code for the proteins causing the bacterial membranes to remain impervious to external substances. Bacteria comprising such mutations singly are known and available. Bacteria comprising all these mutations simultaneously are obtainable by in vivo genetic recombinations methods known per se. An E. coti comprising all of said mutations has been deposited at the C.N.C.M. of the INSTITUT PASTEUR ofParis under number I 152 on April 13, 1981.
