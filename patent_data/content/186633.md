# IMPROVED MOULD AND NOZZLE IN AN INJECTION MOLDING MACHINE

## Abstract
In an injection molding machine, particularly for molding rubber, a nozzle 20, 21 is caused to advance through the stationary upper mould 30 having an axial passage 40 with a frusto conical mouth piece 42 adapted to be a sealing seat for an associate tapered portion 23 or neck of the nozzle body 20 , the end portion 25 of which, beyond said neck zone 23 , has such a length to prevent the nozzle end 26 from protruding to the outside of the lower or inner surface 39 of the mould 30 . The nozzle 20, 21 is also preferably formed, at the inside of its body 20 , with an outwardly flaked portion 27 communicating axially with the injection tapered end 28 . Additionally in a preferred embodiment said passage 40 in the upper mould 30 is slightly flared outwardly, and the end portion 25 of the nozzle body 20 is substantially cylindrical to have a better sealing in the neck zone 23 . The mobile lower mould 30a has, like in the known moulds, an undercut 44 at the zone corresponding to the nozzle end 26 .
