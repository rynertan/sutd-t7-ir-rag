## Description
This invention relates to fermented or cultured dairy products and the process for their manufacture wherein various microorganisms are used to alter the composition of milk to make a more palatable and healthful product. Particularly, the area of invention is directed to the art of making yogurt or a solid spreadable food product or cottage cheese by employing different microorganisms in sequential fermentation stages. More particularly, the invention relates to various methods for preparing dairy products containing Man s knowledge of yogurt making goes back to ancient times as a consequence, little is known concerning the actual origin of yogurt. It is known, however, that yogurt was first used in the Middle East or Asia Minor. Supposedly, yogurt was discovered by nomadic herdsmen who carried milk in a vessel made from a sheep s stomach. It was later found to be that the sheep s stomach was the natural habitat of the yogurt making microorganisms. The domain of the herdsman was the desert and consequently the milk contents was exposed to alternate rapid heating and rapid cooling. During the heat of the day, the microorganisms would multiply rapidly and convert the disaccharide sugar or lactose into glucose and galactose. In the cool of the night, the microbial action would be brought to a halt leaving a custard like substance. The early herdsmen learned that this yogurt was more digestible than the milk from which it originated. Later it was discovered that the yogurt making process could be carried out in earthenware vessels if a small amount of yogurt was used to begin the process anew. The yogurt of ancient times was very much different from what is now known as yogurt. It was not until the yogurt making microorganisms were identified that pure yogurt could be manufactured. United States Patent No. 1,710,133 to Winkler discloses that the use of pure Preparation of the microorganism cultures used to ferment milk is discussed in United States Patent No. 3,480,443 to Schuler. The Schuler process also emphasises the method of single culturing. The advantage of yogurt or fermented dairy products over milk is that the microorganisms convert substantial quantities of lactose, or milk sugar, into glucose. Lactose is not readily digested by most humans and must first be converted to glucose and galactose, usually in the stomach. Although the yogurt making process will achieve some lactose conversion much lactose still remains present. It was to this problem that my prior invention, disclosed in United States Patent No. 4,034,115, was directed. According to my prior invention, skim milk, ordinary milk, with or without non fat milk solids, is raised to a temperature suitable for the culturing process and inoculated with lactose forming bacteria cultures used in the production of ordinary buttermilk. Fermentation is allowed to continue until the lactose is hydrolyzed as fully as possible into glucose and galactose. At this point where approximately 80 percent of the lactose remains the mixture is then inoculated a second time with yogurt making bacteria and allowed to ferment. The second fermentation further reduces the lactose and is allowed to continue until the curd starts to separate from the whey. The substance is then allowed to cool and thereupon small amounts of colostrum are added. The mixture is then inoculated a third time and allowed to ferment completing the transformation of the lactose as fully as possible. My prior invention, though offering substantial improvements over the prior art, had some disadvantages with regard to the production of a commercially practicable product. My prior invention required three or more fermentations whereas the method of the present invention requires only two. Moreover, the restricted availability of colostrum places severe limitations on the quantity of product that can be produced by the method of my prior invention. Not only does my present invention result in a simpler method of manufacture, it eliminates the need for colostrum and the third fermentation step, but it also has the advantage of producing a more flavorful product than was achieved by my prior invention. Not only does my present invention remove lactose in substantial quantities, but accomplishes that goal by improving the nutritional content of the substance. This invention relates to a multi cultured milk product with an acceptable and palatable flavor and the processes for their preparation. More specifically, this invention relates to a unique multi cultured milk product and a process that reduces the disaccharide sugar or lactose more completely than heretofore thought possible thereby increasing the amount of glucose and galactose. Prior milk products that have been prepared by multiple fermentation have used either alcohol or heat during the preparation which have the effect of hindering the enzymatic transformation of lactose to glucose and galactose. The use of alcohol in a milk product through some form of fermentation with yeast inhibits some of the enzymes normally present in milk and produces food of lessened nutritional content. Moreover, some people are allergic to the lactose in milk itself and are, therefore, denied the benefits of a milk product. For millions of people, intolerance develops during the life cycle such that they are unable to easily digest lactose, a condition that is believed to arise from the deficiency of B galactosidase in the intestinal microville. Previously, bacteria used as starters for culturing various types of milk based products have included spherical types such as In previously developed processes, the lactose was broken down by various fermentation processes converting the lactose into lactic acid as when milk with or without non fat milk solids, partly skim milk or skim milk or skim milk is changed into yogurt or buttermilk however, over 80 percent of the disaccharide sugar may remain unspent after the buttermilk and sour cream fermentation is completed. Further efforts to remove the lactose have resulted in the past in lowering the nutritional value of the milk product or producing products that are unpalatable. It has also been incorrectly assumed that cultures must be balanced when used together. One culture will reach a peak at which curd starts to separate from the whey. At this point, the addition of different varieties of souring cultures will produce new curdling as though no souring had occurred when the product is brought to a temperature suitable for optimal growth. Here, temperature is the controlling factor. An inexpensive process to produce milk products digestible to the multitude of people who cannot drink it would have far reaching effects, particularly if substantial quantities of lactose can be transformed without altering the nutritional value of the milk products, except to improve it. The therapeutic value of inoculating milk with various strains of microorganisms has been reported by numerous authorities to be particularly important for maintaining good intestinal metabolism and health. Three species of such microorganism cultures include Until a few years ago, the beneficial effects resulting from the ingestion of The form in which The beneficial effects of Various processes that have been developed to prepare a multi cultured milk product of this type have involved using yeast or alcohol which must necessarily interfere with the antibiotic effect of the bacteria since alcohol destroys bacteria. Various yogurt type products, as distinguished from ordinary dairy yogurt, have been produced by either a mixing together of separate fermented products such as in United States Patent No. 1,889,817 Matt issuing on February 28, 1933 high heat treatment as in United States Patent No. 2,119,599 Nordsiek issuing on June 7, 1938 or alcoholic fermentation as in United States Patent No. 2,842,804 Mishima issuing on February 25, 1958. None of these processes, however, produces a palatable product, and attempts to improve the flavor have not been satisfactory. The addition of flavors and sugar, particularly fresh fruits and berries, to the mixes undergoing the incubation stage has met with disfavor in that the incubation conditions have caused loss of flavor and color in the flavoring additives. Moreover, because the digestion of fruits and milk involve different enzymes and different digestive processes, such mixing may involve enzymatic and other conflicts ruining any such mixture as a health food. Other processing attempts have resulted in poorly controlled growth conditions which yield inferior quality taste, poor shelf life, as well as substantially altering the nutritional value of the milk product. It is the purpose of this invention to provide a new nutritional and therapeutic milk product made by a multi culturing process that will significantly reduce the unspent lactose after a yogurt type fermentation is completed and produce a product that is tasteful and can be digested by persons having an intolerance for lactose, besides being more easily digested by anyone. Another basic purpose of this invention is to provide a food product, pleasing to the taste, to act as a vehicle for the ingestion of The present invention provides a method of producing a multi cultured food product which comprises This invention depends upon the finding that commercial cultured yogurt ordinarily considered to be fully cultured may be cultured further through the use of An advantage of re culturing beyond usual culturing is the result of an additional breakdown of lactose into monosaccharides, thus making the product still more digestible for those individuals allergic to milk. A further advantage of this invention is that multi culturing with A fundamental function of this invention is to culture what is considered a fully cultured food product still further into a multi cultured food product. The multi culturing process, as described in this patent, breaks down lactose in milk or milk sugar into glucose and galactose, while enhancing the amount of the enzyme lactase in the finished product. Lactase is an enzyme found in limited quantity in raw milk, but is destroyed by pasteurization, and thus conceivably produces a dietary shortage of lactase. The multi culturing process of this invention, more fully than by any other method yet offered, overcomes this lactose shortage and yet maintains the flavor advantages of yogurt, or of cottage cheese. Other objects of the invention will be apparent from the following discussion and description of this invention. Multi cultured buttermilk or yogurt may also be used in the preparation of multi cultured cottage cheese in a manner described herein. The general method of the present invention is comprised of numerous sequential steps. Initially, a first and a second culture are produced separately. The first culture is comprised of In the first step of the actual process, milk or milk products such as cream, partially skimmed milk and skim milk are combined in a mixing tank with concentrated skim milk, non fat dry milk or other milk derived ingredients used to standardize milk solids not fat. In the second step the combined ingredients in the mixing tank are mixed thoroughly. The mixing step can be accomplished mechanically or in conjunction with the pasteurization step that follows. Pasteurization may be accomplished in any of the methods well known in the art. In one embodiment of the invention, however, it should be noted that the pasteurization step can be entirely avoided, as is subsequently explained, because the successive fermentation steps achieve sufficient destruction of the harmful entities usually destroyed in the pasteurization process to render a very healthful product. After the mixing and pasteurization steps are completed, if pasteurization is desired the entire mixture is cooled to a first fermentation temperature in the range of about 40 C to about 50 C. After the mixture reaches the desired temperature it is innoculated with the first culture initiating a first fermentation. The first fermentation is allowed to continue at the first fermentation temperature for a time sufficient enough that an amount of lactic acid is generated to produce a first cultured product. The first cultured product is then cooled to a second fermentation temperature in the range of about 35 C to about 39 C. When the first cultured product is sufficiently cooled and thus arresting any further activity of the first culture the first cultured product is innoculated with the second culture to initiate a second fermentation and produce a second cultured product. The second fermentation is allowed to continue at the second fermentation temperature for a time sufficient enough to produce a palatable and healthful multi cultured food product. Yogurt is generally made from a mix standardized from whole, partially defatted milk, condensed skim milk, cream and nonfat dry milk. Alternatively, milk may be partly concentrated by removal of about 15 to about 20 water in a vacuum pan. Supplementation of milk solids non fat MSNF with nonfat dry milk is the preferred industrial procedure. All dairy raw materials should be of a high bacteriological quality, ingredients containing mastitis milk and rancid milk should be avoided. Milk partially fermented with contaminant organisms, or milk containing antibiotic and sanitizing chemical residues cannot be used for yogurt production as it interferes with the activity of the beneficial microorganisms. The milk fat levels in yogurt range from about 1.00 to about 3.25 . The proposed federal standards of identity Federal Register 1977 define the product in three categories. The product containing a minimum of 3.25 milk fat is called yogurt. Low fat yogurt contains not less than 0.5 and not more than 2 milk fat. The product containing less than 0.5 milk fat is labeled as nonfat yogurt. In all the categories of yogurt, a MSNF minimum of 8.25 and a titratable acidity minimum of 0.5 lactic acid is required. The ingredients are cream, milk, partially skimmed milk and skim milk, alone or in combination. Concentrated skim milk, non fat dry milk or other milk derived ingredients may be used to standardize MSNF content of the mixture. Presumably, the milk derived ingredients include casein, sodium and calcium caseinates, whey protein concentrates alone or in combination. The use of milk derived ingredients is permitted on the condition that the ratio of protein to total nonfat solids of the food and the protein efficiency ratio of all protein present should not be diminished. Additives permitted are nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners, coloring, stabilizers and fruit preparations for flavoring yogurt. The culture is specified as Nutritive carbohydrates used in the yogurt making process are similar to the sweeteners used in ice cream and other frozen desserts described by Arbuckle 1972 . Sucrose is the major sweetener used in yogurt production. Soemtimes, corn sweeteners and honey may also be used. The level of sucrose in the yogurt mixture appears to affect the production of lactic acid and flavor by the yogurt culture. Bills Lactase has been suggested for hydrolysis of lactose to a sweeter mixture of glucose and galactose in yogurt, thereby reducing the level of sucrose required to achieve a constant degree of sweetness Kosikowski and Wierzbicki 1971, Engel 1973 . Goodenough and Kleyn 1976 investigated qualitative and quantitative changes in yogurt during its manufacture. They reported average lactose concentration of 8.5 in yogurt mix. Upon fermentation, the lactose level dropped to 5.75 with a concommitant increase of 1.20 galactose. Glucose was detected only in trace quantities. Commercial yogurts had, on an average, above 4.0 pH, 4.06 lactose, 1.85 galactose and 0.05 glucose, but multi cultured yogurt may have a still lower pH. The primary purpose of using a stabilizer in yogurt is to produce smooth body and texture, impart gel structure and reduce wheying off or syneresis. The stabilizer increases shelf life and provides a reasonable degree of uniformity to the product. Stabilizers function by forming gel structures in water, thereby leaving less free water for syneresis. In addition, some stabilizers complex with casein or milk. A good yogurt stabilizer should not impart any flavor, be effective at low pH values, and should be easily dispersible at the normal working temperature in a dairy plant. The stabilizers generally used in yogurt are gelatin, vegatable gums like carboxymethyl cellulose, locust bean, guar and seaweed gums like alginates and carrageenans Hall 1975 . Gelatin is derived by irreversible hydrolysis of proteins collagen and ossein it is used in a level of 0.3 to about 0.5 to get a smooth shiny appearance in refrigerated yogurt. Gelatin is a good stabilizer for frozen yogurt. The term Bloom refers to the gel strength as determined by a Bloom gelometer under standard conditions of the test. Gelatin of Bloom strength 225 or 250 is commonly used. Gelatin level should be directed to the consistency standards of yogurt. Levels above 0.35 tend to impart to yogurt of relatively high milk solids a curdly appearance upon stirring. At temperatures below 10 C, the yogurt acquires a pudding like consistency. Gelatin tends to degrade at ultra high temperatures of processing thus its activity is temperature dependent. Yogurt gel is considerably weakened by a rise in temperature. Furthermore, being an animal product of unknown origin, gelatin is generally not acceptable in Kosher yogurts. The seaweed gums impart a desirable viscosity as well as gel structure to yogurt. Algin and sodium alginate are derived from giant sea kelp. Carrageenan is made from Irish moss and compares favorably with 250 Bloom gelatin in stabilizing value. These stabilizers are heat stable and promote stabilization of yogurt gel by complex formation with Ca and casein. Among the seed gums, locust bean gum or carob gum is derived from the seeds of a leguminous tree. Carob gum is quite effective at low pH levels. Guar gum is also obtained from seeds and is a good stabilizer for yogurt. It is readily soluble in cold water and is not affected by high temperatures used in the pasteurization of the yogurt mixture. Carboxymethyl cellulose is a cellulose product and is effective at high processing temperatures. The stabilizer system used in yogurt mix preparation is generally a combination of various vegetable stabilizers to which gelatin may or may not be added. Their ratios as well as the final concentration generally in the range of 0.5 to about 0.7 in the product are carefully controlled to get desirable effects. Other stabilizers reportedly used are agar and pectin Humphreys and Plunkett 1969 . CaCl₂ may be useful in controlling whey separation Pette and Lolkema 1951 . For a detailed description of various industrial gums, The fruit preparations for blending in yogurt are specially designed to meet the marketing requirements for the type of yogurt. They are generally present at levels of about 15 to about 20 in the final product Craven 1975 . A majority of the fruits contain natural WONF flavors. There are many types of yogurts marketed in the United States, such as but not limited to, Fruit on Bottom or Eastern Sundae Style, Western Sundae Style and Swiss Style. In Fruit on Bottom or Eastern Sundae Style Yogurt, 2 oz. of fruit preserves are layered at the bottom followed by 6 oz. of inoculated yogurt mix on the top. No flavorant or sweetener is added to the yogurt. After placing the lids on the cups, incubation and ferementation takes place in the cups. When a desirable pH level in the range of 4.4 to 4.2 is attained in ordinary yogurt the yogurt of the present invention would be less , the cups are placed in refrigerated rooms for rapid cooling. For consumption, the fruit and yogurt layers are mixed by the consumer. Fruit preserves have a standard of identity. A preserve is made from 55 sugar, and a minimum of 45 fruit by cooking until the final soluble solids content is 68 or higher 65 in the case of certain fruits Gross 1974 . Frozen fruits and juices are the usual raw material. Commercial pectin, 150 grade, is normally utilized at a level of 0.5 in preserves and the pH is adjusted to a range of 3.0 to about 3.5 with a food grade acid, such as citric acid, during manufacture of the preserves. In Western Sundae Style Yogurt fruit preserves or special fruit preparations may form the bottom layer. The top layer comprises yogurt containing sweetener, flavorant and food color representing the fruit on the bottom. The flavorant level is usually in the range of about 2 to about 4 in the top layer. In other respects, this yogurt is identical to Eastern Sundae Style. In Swiss Style Yogurt, also known as Continental Style, French Style and Stirred yogurt, the fruit preparation is thoroughly blended in the yogurt after culturing. Stabilizers are necessary in this form of yogurt unless MSNF levels are relatively high in the range of about 14 to about 16 . In this style yogurt, cups are filled with the blended yogurt mixture and fruit. Upon refrigerated storage for 48 hours, the clot is reformed to exhibit a fine body and texture. Overstabilized yogurt possesses a solid like consistency and lacks a refreshing character. Yogurt should not be so thin that it is drinkable it should melt in the mouth without chewing. Flavors and certified food colors are usually added for eye appeal and better flavor profile. The fruit base should meet the following requirements a exhibit true color and flavor of the fruit when blended with yogurt, b be easily dispersible in yogurt without causing texture defects, phase separation or syneresis in this regard the pH of the fruit base should be compatible with the yogurt pH and c have a microbiological quality so that yeasts and molds can be controlled in the final product to prevent spoilage and to extend shelf life. Fruit preserves do not necessarily meet all these requirements, especially flavor, sugar level, consistency and pH. Accordingly, special fruit bases having the following composition are designed for use in stirred yogurt. Citric acid added to get pH in the range of about 3.7 to about 4.2. CaCl₂ and certain food grade phosphates are also used in several fruit preparations. The soluble solids range from about 60 to about 65 and viscosity is standard to 5 1.5 Bostwick units cm , 30 second reading at 24 C. Standard plate counts on the fruit bases are generally less than 55 g. Coliform count, yeast and mold count is less than 10 g. The fruit flavors vary in popularity in different parts of the country and during different times of the year. In general, more popular fruits are strawberry, rasberry, blueberry, peach, cherry, orange, lemon, purple plum, boysenberry, spiced apple, apricot and pineapple. Blends of these fruits are also popular. Fruits used in yogurt base manufacture may be frozen, canned, dried or combinations thereof. Among the frozen fruits are strawberry, rasberry, blueberry, apple, peach, orange, lemon, cherry, purple plum, blackberry and cranberry. Canned fruits are pineapple, peach, mandarin orange, lemon, purple plum and maraschino cherry. The dried fruit category includes apricot, apple, and prune. Fruit juices and syrups are also incorporated in the bases. Sugar in the fruit base functions in protecting fruit flavor against loss volatilization and oxidation. It also balances the fruit and the yogurt flavor. The pH control of the base is important for fruit color retention. The color of yogurt should represent the fruit color in intensity, hue and shade. The base should be stored under refrigeration to retain optimum flavor and to extend shelf life. The yogurt starter or first culture is a critical ingredient in yogurt manufacture with important consequnces for texture and flavor. For the practical aspects of yogurt culture, The production of flavor by the yogurt starter is a function of time as well as sugar content of the yogurt mixture. Gorner et al. 1968 reported that acetaldehyde production in yogurt takes place predominantly in the first 1 or 2 hours of incubation eventually, 23 to about 55 ppm of acetaldehyde is found in yogurt. Hamdan The milk coagulum during yogurt production results from an increase in acidity due to the activity of the yogurt starter. The streptococci are responsible for increasing the acidity of yogurt mix to the range of about pH 5.5 to about pH 5.0 and the lactobacilli are primarily responsible for further increasing of acidity to pH 4.4 approximately. Attempts have been made to improve the viscosity and to prevent syneresis of yogurt by including a slime producing strain of The acidity of ordinary yogurt during storage continues to increase from about pH 4.62 to about pH 4.15 in about 6 days of storage at 4 C Gavin 1965 . High storage temperatures accelerate the increase in acidity. Most yogurt manufacturers incorporate from 5 to about 7 sucrose in their yogurt mixture prior to culturing. Tramer 1973 reported that various strains of yogurt cultures responded differently to various levels of sucrose. No inhibition of culture activity was noticed up to 5.5 sucrose concentrations. At higher sucrose levels, acid production by the yogurt starter was partially inhibited. This effect was primarily ascribed to the stress on lactobacilli and was related to the total solids level in yogurt. Total solids, consisting of milk solids and sweeteners, above a level of 22 inhibit The inhibition of yogurt starter is also caused by antibiotic residues in milk. Mocquot and Hurel 1970 reported that both Phages are not a practical threat to yogurt making if frozen yogurt starters are used and proper rotation is practiced along with high sanitation standards in the plant. Phages for yogurt cultures, however, have been isolated Reinhold and Reddy 1973 Kosikowski 1977 . Hypochlorites and quarternary ammonium compounds also inhibit yogurt cultures Bouchez and van Bellegham 1971 . Pasteurization or heat treatment of the raw milk at 85 C for 30 minutes, or its equivalent, is an important step in the manufacture of yogurt so that the product is sterilized and any undesirable bacteria are eliminated. The heat treatment a produces a sterile medium for the exclusive growth of the yogurt starter b removes air from the medium to produce a more conducive medium for microaerophilic lactic cultures to grow c effects thermal breakdown of milk constituents, especially proteins, releasing peptones, sulfhydryl groups which provide nutrition and anaerobic effects for the yogurt starter and d denatures and coagulates milk albumins and globulins which enhance the viscosity and produce custard like consistency in the product. It should be noted, however, that according to one embodiment of my invention, the heat treatment step is not employed. Instead of pasteurizing the milk, the action of the various microbes is used to destroy those microorganisms harmful to mankind. Homogenization also aids in the texture development and, additionally, it alleviates the surface creaming and wheying off problem. lonic salt balance in milk is also involved in the wheying off problem. Plain yogurt normally contains no added sugar or flavors to offer the consumer natural yogurt flavor for consumption as such or an option of flavoring with other food materials of the consumer s choice. In addition, it may be used for cooking or for salad preparation with fresh fruits preferred by the consumer. Also, the size and type of the package may be geared to the market demand, however, wax coated cups as well as plastic cups and lids are the chief packaging materials used in the industry. Multi cultured yogurt may be produced by adding one additional step to the normal yogurt making process that is adding a minimum of 1 that is, 1 part culture for every 100 parts yogurt In addition, The interactions between Bifidobacterium bifidum N4 B. bifidum and Escherichia K 12 E. coli were investigated in their mixed cultures. Under conditions in which both bacteria grew well in their pure culture, B. bifidum inhibited the growth of E. coli even when the latter was inoculated at 10⁴ fold and preincubated for 41 hours. The inhibition in the mixed cultures appeared when the pH values were reduced below 4.6... A strain of domestic bacteria, Bifidobacterium bifidum Lac B , which is nonpathogenic and anaerobic, selectively localized and proliferated in several types of mouse tumors following i.v. administration. None of the same bacilli could be detected in the tissues of healthy organs such as the liver, spleen, kidney, lung, blood, bone marrow, and muscle 48 or 96 hrs. after i.v. administration into tumor bearing mice. A multi cultured food product made with In one embodiment of the present invention whole milk was fermented with a 1 The 48 hour fermentation time may be a disadvantage in a commercial dairy plant. Single culturing with This invention also relates to cottage cheese made by substituting a double cultured dairy product comprised of As stated, in processing, the pH should be reduced by .5 approximately. However, the pH reduction in plain yogurt by any significant amount by re culturing represents the breaking down of more lactose, a major factor in this invention. Wilcox 1971 reviewed the processes for making yogurt with polyunsaturated corn oil, instant yogurt and yogurt enriched with vitamin C. Soft serve yogurt, hard packed yogurt and novelty items based upon yogurt are relatively new products getting an enthusiastic response by the consumer. Push ups, frozen yogurt on a stick, skippy cups and tetrapaks are being manufactured and marketed. The frozen yogurt base mix may be manufactured in a cultured dairy plant and shipped to a soft serve operator or an ice cream plant. Alternatively, the mix may be prepared and frozen in an ice cream plant. The following formulation is generally used milk fat in the range of about 1.5 to about 2.0 , MSNF in the range of about 13 to about 15 , 250 Bloom gelatin in the range of about 0.15 to about 0.20 , sucrose in the range of about 7 to about 10 and corn syrup solids 24 26 DE in the range of about 4 to about 5 . These ingredients except one half of the sugar are standardized in a blend tank and pasteurized at 88 C for 40 minutes. The mixture is then homogenized at a temperature in the range of about 58 C to about 63 C at 1500 psi, then cooled to 44 C. Yogurt culture is then inoculated and incubation of the mixture is continued until pH 3.9 is attained. The yogurt mixture is then cooled to 25 C and the remaining sugar and fruit are then blended. Special fruit preparations designed for frozen yogurt are used at a level of about 15 to about 20 . This mixture is then frozen in an ice cream freezer at about 50 to about 60 overrun, packed and hardened similar to ice cream. To obtain a soft serve product, a soft serve freezer is used at a draw temperature of 8 C. A quality control program for yogurt manufacture includes the control of product flavor, body, texture, color, process and composition. The flavor defects are generally described as too intense, too weak or unnatural. The sweetness level may be excessive, weak or may exhibit corn syrup flavor. The flavor may be too tart, weak or atypical. The ingredients used may impart undesirable flavors like stale, metallic, old ingredients, oxidized, rancid or unclean. Lack of control in processing procedures may cause overcooked, caramelized or too tart flavor. Proper control of processing parameters and ingredient quality insures good flavor. In hard pack frozen yogurt, a coarse and icy mixture may be caused by storage temperature fluctuations. Sandiness may be due to lactose crystals resulting from too high levels of milk solids or whey solids. A soggy or gummy defect is caused by too high a MSNF level or a too high sugar content. A weak body results from too high an overrun end insufficient total solids. Color defects may be caused by the lack of intensity or authenticity of hue and shade. Proper blending of fruit purees and yogurt mixture is necessary for uniformity of color. The compositional control tests are fat, moisture, pH, and overrun for frozen yogurt and microscopic examination of yogurt starter to insure a ratio of 1 1 in Although the invention is described in terms of particular ingredients and in what is conceived to be the most practical and preferred method, it is recognized that departures made that fall within the scope of this invention, which is not to be limited to the details disclosed herein but is to be accorded the full scope of the claims so as to embrace any and all equivalent ingredients and methods, including other starters used in cultured products, such as
