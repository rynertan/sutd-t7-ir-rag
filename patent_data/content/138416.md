A 44 amino acid peptide having growth hormone releasing activity has recently been reported Guillemin A shortened form of the foregoing peptide, also having growth hormone releasing activity, was also reported Rivier A study of growth hormone release factor GRF whether the 44 amino acid form or the shortened 40 amino acid form has established as its name implies its efficacy in stimulating pituitary release of growth hormone. It has also been suggested Rivier Rivier The implicit conclusions of the Rivier It has now been discovered that, contrary to the Rivier As noted, the compounds of this invention are peptides having the general sequence of hpGRF or amino terminal portions thereof, but differing therefrom by replacement of the methionine Met residue in position 27 by any of a number of amino acid residues. The thioether side chain functionality of methionine is susceptible to several modification reactions including oxidation, alkylation, and cyanolation. While selective modification is achievable in the presence of tryptophan, cysteine, and cystine residues, their absence facilitates quantitative derivatization to a homogenous product. While modification studies can provide a considerable amount of information regarding structure function relationships, it is quite restrictive in which derivatives can be constructed. Most often, peptide modification serves as a prelude to the more laborious total synthesis of a structural variant, as this approach allows much greater freedom in selection of the desired derivative. The quantitative conversion of methionine residues to the sulfoxide derivatives in α chymotrypsin Weiner, H., Batt, C.W., and Roshland, D.E., Jr. 1966 The methionine of hpGRF is, in accordance with this invention, replaced by a residue designated as X. The group X can be any of the following amino acid residues, each of which carries the L configuration Met O , Met S Me or Hse. Included in the compounds of this invention are their pharmaceutically acceptable non toxic acid addition salts and their pharmaceutically acceptable non toxic carboxylic acid salts. The term pharmaceutically acceptable non toxic acid addition salts encompasses both organic and inorganic acid addition salts including, for example, those prepared from acids such as hydrochloric, hydrofluoric, sulfuric, sulfonic, tartaric, fumaric, hydrobromic, glycolic, citric, maleic, phosphoric, succinic, acetic, nitric, benzoic, ascorbic, p toluenesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, naphthalenesulfonic, propionic, and the like. Preferably, the acid addition salts are those prepared from hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, or succinic acid. Any of the above salts is prepared by conventional methods. The term carboxylic acid salts includes, for example, ammonium, alkali metal salts such as sodium, potassium, and lithium, and the like. The compounds of this invention can be prepared by any of a variety of recognized peptide synthesis techniques including classical solution methods and solid phase methods. The compound of this invention in which X is Met O , Met S Me , or Hse, can be prepared from the corresponding Met containing precursors by treatment with hydrogen peroxide, methyl iodide, or cyanogen bromide, respectively. One of the principal methods for preparing the compounds of this invention is by the solid phase technique in which the amino acid sequence is constructed sequentially from an initial, insoluble, resin supported C terminal amino acid. Techniques for the solid phase method are described by J. Stewart In general, in the solid phase method, the amino acid corresponding to the C terminal amino acid residue of the desired peptide is anchored to an insoluble resin support, and the peptide chain then is formed beginning at the resin supported C terminal amino acid. Individual amino acids are introduced sequentially until the desired amino acid sequence is obtained. Alternatively, small peptide fragments can be prepared and introduced into the peptide chain in the desired order. The peptide chain remains attached to the resin throughout synthesis, and, upon completion of the chain, the peptide is cleaved from the resin. The peptide chain is attached to the polystyrene resin by means of an ester linkage formed between the carboxyl group of the C terminal moiety and a specific methylene group present on the resin matrix as a site for such attachment. The polystyrene resin is a styrene polymer which is cross linked by the addition of about 0.5 to about 3 divinylbenzene and which is chloromethylated or hydroxymethylated to provide sites for ester formation. An example of a hydroxymethylated resin is described by Bodanszky The amino acids are coupled using techniques well known in the art for the formation of peptide bonds. One method involves converting the amino acid to a derivative that will render the carboxyl group more susceptible to reaction with the free N terminal amino group of the peptide fragment. For example, the amino acid can be converted to a mixed anhydride by reaction of a protected amino acid with ethyl chloroformate, phenyl chloroformate, Another coupling method involves use of a suitable coupling agent, such as N,N dicyclohexylcarbodimide DCC or N,N diisopropylcarbodiimide DIC . Other appropriate coupling agents will be apparent to those skilled in the art. See Schroder and Lubke, It should be recognized that the α amino group of each amino acid employed in the peptide synthesis must be protected during the coupling reaction to prevent side reactions involving the reactive α amino function. It should also be recognized that certain amino acids contain reactive side chain functional groups e.g. sulfhydryl, ε amino, carboxyl, and hydroxyl , and that such functional groups must also be protected both during the initial and subsequent coupling steps. Suitable protecting groups are known in the art See for example, In selecting a particular protecting group, certain conditions must be observed. An α amino protecting group 1 must render the α amino function inert under the conditions employed in the coupling reaction, 2 must be readily removable after the coupling reaction under conditions that will not remove side chain protecting groups and will not alter the structure of the peptide fragment, and 3 must eliminate the possibility of racemization upon activation immediately prior to coupling. A side chain protecting group 1 must render the side chain functional group inert under the conditions employed in the coupling reaction, 2 must be stable under the conditions employed in removing the α amino protecting group, and 3 must be readily removable upon completion of the desired amino acid sequence under reaction conditions that will not alter the structure of the peptide chain. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the protecting groups known to be useful for peptide synthesis will vary in reactivity to the agents employed for their removal. For example, certain protecting groups, such as triphenylmethyl and 2 Illustrative examples of amino acid protecting groups are set forth below. Upon completion of the desired peptide sequence, the protected peptide must be cleaved from the resin support, and all protecting groups must be removed. The cleavage reaction and removal of the protecting groups may be accomplished simultaneously or stepwise. When the resin support is a chloromethylated polystyrene resin, the bond anchoring the peptide to the resin is an ester linkage formed between the free carboxyl group of the C terminal moiety and one of the many chloromethyl groups present on the resin matrix. It will be recognized that the anchoring bond can be cleaved by reagents which are known to be capable of breaking an ester linkage and of penetrating the resin matrix. One especially convenient method is by treatment with liquid anhydrous hydrogen fluoride. This reagent not only will cleave the peptide from the resin but will also remove all protecting groups. Hence, use of this reagent will directly afford the fully deprotected peptide. When it is desired to cleave the peptide without removing protecting groups, the protected peptide resin can undergo methanolysis to give the protected peptide in which the C terminal carboxyl group is methylated. The methyl ester can then be hydrolyzed under mild, alkaline conditions to give the free C terminal carboxyl. The protecting groups on the peptide chain then can be removed by treatment with a strong acid, such as liquid hydrogen fluoride. A particularly useful technique for methanolysis is that of G. Moore Another method for cleaving the protected peptide from the resin is by ammonolysis or by treatment with hydrazine. If desired, the resulting C terminal amide or hydrazide can be hydrolyzed to the free C terminal carboxyl, and the protecting groups can be removed conventionally. It will also be recognized that the protecting group present on the N terminal α amino group may be removed preferentially either before or after the protected peptide is cleaved from the resin support. A typical preparation of amide compounds of the present invention by solid phase synthesis is achieved on a copolymer styrene 2 divinylbenzene benzhydrylamine resin, 100 200 mesh. The free benzhydrylamine level is determined by ninhydrin derivatization and nitrogen elemental analysis. In each step of the synthesis, the ratio of solvent to polystyrene is maintained at 10 ml. per each gram of resin. All amino acids are employed as their All other amino acids are attached by the following protocol 1 5 diisopropylethylamine methylene chloride, 2 x 2 minutes 2 methylene chloride, 6 x 1 minute 3 The compounds of this invention, when prepared by solid phase peptide synthesis, are initially purified by gel permeation chromatography on a G 50 superfine column in 10 v v acetic acid at a linear flow rate of 10 cm hour. Purification to homogeneity is achieved by reverse phase on a 0.46 x 25 cm Zorbax C₈ column, employing a linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1 Solid phase synthesis and purification of the α carboxylic acid compounds of this invention is achieved as described above with the exception that synthesis is initiated on a copolymer styrene 1 divinylbenzene chloromethyl resin, 100 200 mesh.
