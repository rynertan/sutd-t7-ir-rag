## Description
DESCRIPTION STEERING WHEEL SHOCK ABSORBER This invention relates generally to shock absorbing means for the steering wheel of all sorts of vehicles, for example cars, vans, trucks, and heavy duty earth moving equipment, and more particularly it pertains to such a device for absorbing shocks normally transmitted up, through the steering mechanism, from the steerable road wheels to the steering wheel and to the driver. The desirability of providing shock absorbing arrangements for vehicle steering wheels is generally known in the art and numerous prior patents have issued relating to various shock absorbing mechanisms for this purpose. Some of these prior art devices are incorporated wholly within the steering wheel shaft. Other such devices make use of flexible or resilient steering wheel spokes or equivalent structures for absorbing shocks. A basic consideration in all such devices is to eliminate feedback and wheel fright , which are undesirable forces transmitted from the steerable road wheels up through the steering gear to the steering wheel. Feedback includes various road shocks, and other shocks to which the vehicle is subjected and which are passed on to the driver through the front end steering gear and the steering wheel. In eliminating such shocks, it is important at the same time that full control be maintained and that the driver experience feel of the wheel . Further, it is essential that there be some type of fail safe back up in the shock isolating structure so that positive steering can be achieved even though the shuck absorbing portion of the system should fail. While many prior proposed shock absorbing structures for steering wheels purport to accomplish the foregoing, there is still room for vast improvements in this area, particularly as regards reliability, ease of installation, economical manufacture and generally improved overall performance. Accordingly, the present invention provides a vehicle steering wheel shock absorber characterised in that it comprises a first member for securing to a steering wheel a second member for securing to a vehicle steering shaft in spaced relation to said first member shock absorbing resilient material joining said first and second members together and at least one projection on said first member projecting into a corresponding cavity in said second merger, the projection being normally out of contact with said cavity and being adapted to contact said cavity in the event of failure of said resilient material, to provide a safety coupling between said steering wheel and said steering shaft. If the limits of movement are exceeded, for example as a result of disintegration or other failure of the resilient material, the said at least one projection will only then engage the corresponding cavity in physical metal to metal contact to assure positive movement of the second member and steering shaft by the first member and the steering wheel. A safety coupling is thus provided between the steering wheel and the shaft. The said first member may be a casting or a welded body. Preferably the said second member to be connected to the steering wheel shaft may be radially inwardly of the said first member and comprise a pair of cup like shell portions which are joined to each other to form a rigid single member. This has advantages which include the fact that the shell portions are identical to each other, thus greatly facilitating their manufacture. Further, a pair of such shell portions together with a steering shaft hub designed to fit a particular vehicle, will be all that is needed to mount the shock absorber and the steering wheel on different vehicles. The said second member may be the same for all embodiments, with possible minor differences to accommodate different steering wheels. The shell portions of the inner member are advantageously dimpled or indented away from the surface at which they contact each other and into their cylindrical walls. Thus, when put together, the shell portionsEzve their dimples in facing relation to form a cavity in which a suitable pin mounted on the second member is positioned in normally non contacting relationship, to form the safety interlock of the shock absorber of this invention. The resilient material is formed in situ between the members and around the pins, thus formirg a sub assembly which may be without a hub. An advantage of the invention is that it permits the pre fabrication, as a sub assemblyt of the two members with the shock absorbing material. The rivet holes in the inner member are used to hold the parts for this step, and are later used to join a hub to the sub assembly to thereby fit the invention to a particular application. The term shell portion as used in this specification shall be understood to refer to components of a member made up of partial members, and not necessarily a member which is split into two equal pieces. In order that this invention may more fully be understood the followIng detailed doscription is given, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a fragmentary perspective view partially broken away showing a vehicle steering wheel and steering shaft incorporating the invention Figure 2 is an enlarged sectional view taken generally along line 2 2 of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a plan view taken on line 3 3 of Figure 2, Figure 4 is a view similar to Figure 2 but illustrating a modified steering colurs hub. Figure 5 is a broken away perspective view of a third embodiment of the invention Figure 6 is a broken away perspective view of a fourth embodiment of the invention Figure 7 is a broken away perspective view of a fifth embodiment of the invention Figure 8 is a full cross section taken in the direction of the arrows 8 8 of Figure 7 Figure 9 is an exploded perspective view of a steering wheel and steering shaft illustrating a sixth embodiment of this invention and Figure 10 shows an axial sectional view of one of the three shock absorber units of Figure 9. Referrina now in detail to the drawings, it will be seen that Figure 1 shows a vehicle steering wheel 10 comprising a wheel rim portion 11 and a plurality of radial spokes 12. The steering wheel shaft 13 is indicated in part by phantom lines, where it is encased in conventional manner within a steering column 14. The steering wheel hub comprises a first or outer annular hub member 15 which, as shown inFigure 2, has a shoulder 17 at its upper end. This shoulder is provided with a plurality of threaded openings 18 arranged to register with corresponding openings in the central ring 19 of the steering wheel 11. Screws 16 join the steering wheel hub ring 19 to the first outer hub member 15.An overlying retainer ring, and other means to accommodate a conventional horn button all not shown are also envisaged and their mounting will make use of the screws 16, as necessary, in the conventional manner Figures 2 and 3 show a second or inner annular hub member 20 arranged in coaxial concentric relationship within outer hub member 15. This inner hub member 20 comprises a steering shaft hub 22 which has a splined inner opening to receive the conventional splined end of the steering shaft 13, and is secured thereto by a conventional nut 24. Inner hub member 20 further comprises a pair of identical shell half portions 26. Rivets 28 secure the two shell portions 26 to each other and to the steering shaft hub 22, thereby integrating the inner member 20. Each shell portion 26 comprises an outer cylindrical wall 30, and an annular wall 32 formed with a central opening 34. The steering shaft hub 22 has turned portion forming a shoulder 36 to receive the two annular walls 32 of the pair of shell portions 26. Walls 32 are also formed with suitable openings that receive the rivets 28. Each shell portion 26 is formed with a quarter spherical indentation 38 at three places equiangularly disposed along its periphery at the juncture of its cylindrical wall 30 and annular wall 32. This structure can be appreciated most clearly by comparing Figures 2 and 3. hMen the two shell portions 26 are joined together to form the inner hub member 201 the quarter spherical indentations line up with each other, thus forming hemispherical cavities in the side wall of the hub member 20. The steering shaft hub, which may be cast or machined from the solid, is shown in Figure 3 as being generally triangular or trilobal with each of its three lobes machined to provide the annular shoulder 36 which therefore has a greater radial depth on a lobe sectioned at the right hand side of Figure 2 than in the rectilinear interlobal regions sectioned on the left hand side ofFigure 2 which clear the indentations 28. The inside surface of the outer hub member 15 is provided with three radially inwardly extending pins 35 which project into the hemispherical cavities provided by facing pairs of quarter spherical dimples or indentations 37 in the two shell portions 26 when they are assembled. The pins 40 are preferably stud welded in place on the inside surface of outer hub member 15 in other words they are welded in place by an electric resistance welding process in which the welding current is transmitted by the pin 40 as one welding electrode Alternative fixing methods such as spot welding may be used, if desired. Further, it will be noted that the inner hub member 20 thus presents a continuous outer cylindrical wall made up of the two annular wall portions 30 of the two shell portions. This wall extends over 3600 to define an annular volume between itself and the inside of the cylindrical wall of the outer member 15. This annular volume is filled with a homogeneous resilient material 29 which will bond in intimate surface contact with the juxtaposed wall surfaces over 3600. At present, the material used is polyurethane, but other materials having the necessary strength, resilience, and resistance to oil, grease and temperatures, can be used as will be evident to persons skilled in those arts. If desired, vent holes may be left in the indentations 37 for the purpose of facilitating filling of the cavity in the assembled inner or second annular member 20. With the foregoing arrangement, it will be evident that movements of the outer annular hub member 15 by the steering wheel will be transmitted to the inner hub member 20 to move the steering wheel port 13 solely through the resilient material 29. In other words, because the 3600 annular volume is filled with the resilient material, there is normally no metal to metal contact between the outer and inner annular hub members instead, all torques and other forces and movements of the steering wheel are transmitted through the resilient material. Physical contact between the outer and inner annular hub members 15 and 20, will occur in the unlikely event of disintegration or other failure of the resilient material 29 occupying the annular space.This contact is accomplished by means of the interaction of the pins 35 on the outer member 15 which are normally positioned inside, but free from contact with, the hemispherical openings formed by the facing pairs of arter spherical indentations 37. In the embodiments shown in Figures 1 to 4, three hemispherical indentations and three pins are provided for purposes of increasing the strength of the back up metal to metal safety means. As is obvious, merely two pins and two corresponding indentations could instead be provided, as will be appreciated fromFigures 5 to 8. Alternatively. more than three pins and cavities could be provided. e.g.1 in physically larger embodiments of the invention. It can be seen that in the event of structural failure of the resilient material 29, torque can still be applied to the steering shaft 13 from the steering wheel 11 so that the driver does not lose control of the vehicle, by way of the interaction of the pins 35 with the hemispherical indentations formed by each pair of indentations 37. As is evident from Figure 3, the parts are so configured that the pins are always trapped with these cavities. Other modifications are possible for example, the quarter spherical shape of the indentations 37 is purely exemplary, it could be a portion of a cuboidal indentation, or it could have a flat sloped side, in which case the shape might have that of half a solid diamond configuration. Further, the indentation could have a surface perpendicular to a radial line through the centre of the assembled shock absorber, in which case the hub could have some configuration other than round, i.e., it could be hexagonal or trapezoidal or have other configurations as needed.The important feature is that, with all such different shapes of the indentations in the inner hub member, the shell portions will mate with each other to form receptacles or cavities to receive the pin 35, or equivalent means, on the outer hub member 15 to provide the metal to metal safety interlock of the invention. The parts 15, 26 and 29 of Figures 1 to 4 are advantageously made as a separate sub assembly, without the hubs. One method of manufacture might be 1. The pins 35 are stud welded to the inside of the outer hub member 15 at their proper locations by having one end received in an aperture of the outer member and then being welded in that position 2. Two inner member shell portions 26 are held in place by suitable temporary jigs, fixtures and the like on the inside of the outer hub member 15 and in their proper position with respect to the pins 35, the aligned holes for rivets 28 being used to facilitate this holding operation and finally 3. The resilient material 29 is then formed in situ. After the resilient material Es cured, the temporary jigs and fixtures can be removed, exposing the rivet holes in the mating shell portions 26 for the rivets 28. These sub assemblies can then be stocked.Thereafter, depending upon which steering shaft hub 22 is required for whatever vehicle, such hub is riveted into place on the stocked preassembled unit comprising inner and outer members already potted in this position. This sequence of manufacture achieves the full advantages of the invention and provides its great versatility for use. Alternatively, the three parts 22, 26 of the inner member could be riveted together first, and the central opening of the hub used for holding in the in situ forming step 3 above, if desirable in some particular environment. In either case the dimensions of the parts, particularly of the pin 35 and the cavity or indentation, are such that the inner member even without the resilient material 29 is positively trapped on the pins 35, in order to ensure the safety locking feature of this invention. For this reason, the inner member parts must be pre assembled at least generally in place on the pins 35 using either the material 29 or the rivets 28 for their assembly. Referring now to Figure 4, there is shown another embodiment in the invention. The versatility of the invention in acco modating different vehicle steering parts is illustrated by Figure 4. The only substantial difference between the embodiment ofFigures 2 and 3 and the embodiment of Figure 4 resides in the different steering post and nut, 13a and 24a respectively, and an appropriately modified steering port hub 22a.By simply forming the shoulder 36a in the hub of a size and shape to accommodate the inner member hub shell portions 26, it is possible to ensure that the steering wheel of the invention can be used with virtually any vehicle It is simply necessary to choose the appropriate hub 22a, whereas the other parts 26 15, and 29, and their sub asF mbly, can be standard. In this manner the manufacturer can simply make standard parts 26 and 15, and keep a stock of hubs 22 for each of the different vehicles with which the invention is to be used, and in this manner great economies of manufacture, storage and the like are achieved. As is ordinary, a horn button is normally included in the assembly shown in Figure 1 in the centre opening Horns will of course require power and an electrical earth contact, not shown in Figures 1 to 4 as such details are outside the scope of the present invention . However the connections may for example be a by way of a flexible lead passed through a hole not shown formed in the hub member 22 and b to earth by way of a helical spring embedded in the resilient material 29 by being placed in situ before the resilient material 29 is introduced and extending radially between the hub outer member 15 and the inner member 38. Such horn buttons are staple items of commerce and can be easily accommodated into the steering wheel of this invention by those skilled in the art. Referring now to a further embodiment of the invention as illustrated in Figure 5, the first annular hub member corresponding to the outer member 15 of Figures 2 and 3 is shown at 38 together with a shoulder defined by a flange 39 for receiving and securing the central ring of a steering wheel in the same manner as described in Figures2 and 4. The second annular member is shown at 40 and is welded to inner hub member 41 with appropriate securing means in the form of a splined socket for securing to the steering shaft. This second annular member 40 is again in coaxial relationship with the first annular member but in this embodiment, the first annular member 38 has a smaller diameter than the second annular member 40, and is nested therein to define annular juxtaposed continuous wall surfaces 42 and 43.As in the embodiment of Figures 2 and 3, these wall surfaces are cylindrical and define an annular volume designated by the arrow 44 to the left of Figure 5. This annular volume is filled with the resilient material 29 as in Figures 2 to 4. In Figure 5, the pins 45 and 46 are on the first annular member 38 on diametrically opposite sides of and parallel to the axis A A of the first annular member 38. These pins are outside of the annular volume 44. In the Figure 3, the cavity cooperating with the pin to provide the safety metal to metal contact in the event of structural failure of material 29 is secured to the second annular member 40 by way of the shaft connecting means and includes a flat disc 47 coaxial with the axis of the second annular member.As shown, this disc includes two ciarnetrically cppo ed arcuate cut outs 48 and 49 omits periphery, of larger size than the diameter of the pins, and partially surrounding the pins to define therewith a normally non contacting spaced relationship between the first and second annular members 138 and 140 with the foregoing arrangement, it will be appeciated that should the resilient material 29 disintegrate1 ph ical metal to metal contact will be made betx en the ins 45 and the disc 47 to assure positive rteerability. In the particular ernbodiment of Figure 5 the resilient material 29 not only fills the annular volume 44 but extends annularly over the edge of the annular continuous wall surface 43 of the second annular member to extend dpwn the exterior thereof thereby providing a cosmetic annular exterior surface designa ea generally by the arrow 50. Figure 6 shows a fourth embodiment wherein again the first annular member is shock at 51 provld with a flange defining a shoulder 52 for seourement to the steering wheel. The second annular member is shown at 53 and includes on its bottom portion connecting means in the form of the splined socket 54 for connection to the steering wheel shaft. Again, first and second annular juxtaposed continuous cylindrical wall surfaces over 3600 are defined by the first and second members at 55 and 56 providing for an annular volume 57 filled with appropriate resilient material 29. The projection in Figure 6 takes the form of a plurality of circumferentially spaced pins 58, 59 and 60 stud welded to the second annular member 53 to extend radially inwardly from the annular wall surface 56 of the second annular member into the annular volume 57. The corresponding cavities are in turn provided on the first annular member and are defined by a similar plurality of circumferentially spaced openings 61, 62 and 63 in the annular wall surface 55, these openings being of larger diameters than the pins and positioned to receive the pins centrally therethrough to provide the metal to metal contact and assure positive coupling. A further feature in the embodiment of Figure 6 resides in the provision of an annular thrust ring 64 in the annular volume 57 seating on the lower end of the annular body of resilient material 29. Cooperating with this ring are circumferentially spaced manually operable screws shown at 65 and 66 threadedly extending up from the bottom of the second annular member 53 at threaded openings 67 and 68 respectively, to engage the underside of the thrust ring 64. While only two such screw means 65 and 66 are shown, there would preferably be provided at least three, circumferentially spaced at 1200 intervals. These screws may be adjusted to exert a squeezing force on the body of resilient material 29 to compress the same and thereby adjust the effective resilience thereof. This adjustment is indicated by the double headed arrows in Figure 6. Figures 7 and 8 illustrate yet another embodiment of the steering wheel of this invention wherein, as shown in Figure 7, the first annular member is shown at 69 and has a shoulder 70 for securing this annular member 69 to the steering wheel. The second annular member 71 is of smaller diameter than the first annular member and is again provided with an appropriate connecting means in the form of a splined socket 72 for connection to the splined steering wheel port. The annular juxtaposed continuous wall surfaces 73 and 74 define therebetween an annular volume 75 when the first and second members are nested along the axis A A. This volume is filled with the resilient material 29 as in the other embodiments. Rather than pins and cup shaped sockets or openings as the spaced projection and cavity to provide metal to metal contact in the event of failure of the resilient material, the projections in the Figure 7 embodiment take the form of circumferentially spaced mounds 76 extending radially inwardly into the annular volume 75, these mounds being defined by undulations in the continuous annular wall surface 73 of the first annular member 69. The cavities in turn comprise circumferentially spaced troughs 77 defined by undulations in the Continuous annular wall surface 74 of the second member 71. As best illustrated in the cross section ofFigure 8, the respective mounds 76 are received in the respective troughs 77 in spaced relationship. In this respect, the radially outward extent of the mounds between the troughs 77 is greater than the radius from the axis A A measured to the radially inwardly extending tips of the mounds 76 so that metal to metal contact is assured should the resilient material 29 disintegrate. The embodiments of Figures 7 and 8, because of the relative confinement resulting from the provision of the mounds and troughs of the annular volume would provide a somewhat stiffer feel to the steering wheel than in some of the other discussed embodiments of similar overall size. Nevertheless, there are certain applications in which this degree of stiffness would be desirable. Referring now to Figures 9 and 10 there is shown a last embodiment of this invention again including first and second annular members with opposing continuous wall surfaces and resilient material therebetween.In this embodiment, however, three sets of such members are provided to provide three individual shock absorbing units for the steering wheel. Thus referring first to Figure 9, there is shown a steering wheel 78 with three spokes 79, 80 and 81. These spokes each terminate in a respective one of three sets of shock absorbing units designated generally 82 83 and 84. A generally triangular shaped plate 85 is secured to portions of the three units and serves as a means for connection to the steering wheel port 86 shown in exploded view below the wheel in Figure 9. Each of the units 82, 83 and 84 is identical in construction, and therefore a detailed description of one will suffice for all. As shown in the cross section of Figure 10 the unit 82 has its first annular member in the form of a flat element 87 integrally secured to the spoke of which a fragmentary portion is shown at 79. Flat element 87 includes a circular opening 88. The second annular member of each unit is defined by two spaced washers 89 and 90 and a stud 97 which secures tb m against a sleeve 95 forming the projection and to the plate 85 which forms the steering port hub member.The two washers 89 and 90 are above and below the respective element 87, these washers Weeing of larger diameter than the circular opening 88. The annular juxtaposed continuous wall surfaces in the embodiment of Figure 10 are thus defined by the underside 91 of washer 89 and upper side 92 of washer 90, and by the opposite juxtaposed surfaces 93 and 94 of the flat element 79 surrounding its circular opening 88. Thc resilient material 29 is again shown within the annular volume between these surfaces and extends over 3600. The cylindrical sleeve 95 forming the projection has a smaller diameter than the circular opening 88 and passes centrally through this openIng. The inside arcuate edge of the circular opening 88 in the first annular member element 87 defines the cavity which has to be in no T, lly non contacting spaced relationship to the cylincrica sleet. The means for securing the first annular member 87 to the spoke 79 comprises simply an integral connection, as shown, and in fact this element may constitute an end portion of the spoke in question.The means for securing the second annular element defined by the washers 89 and 90 and the stud 97 to the steering wheel shaft constitutes a part of the generally triangular plate 85 which is described in Figure 9 and shown in fragmentary view in Figure 10, this portion of the plate 85 having an opening 96 registering with the opening in the lower washer 90. As shown, stud 97 passes through the upper washer 89, cylindrical sleeve 95, lower washer 90 and hole 96 in the plate 85, and a threaded nut 98 secures the assembly together. Since the cylindrical sleeve 95 is captured in the circular opening 881 it will be evident that there are given limits of movement of the steering wheel during which the torques and forces are iransmitted solely through the resilient material 29. Dwever, as in the other embodiments, should the material 29 disintegrate the cylindrical sleeve 95 is captured in the circular opening 88 so that positive metal to metal engagement between the steering wheel and port will occur to provide the safety feature, when three such units as illustrated in Figure 9 are employed From all of the foregoing, it can now be appreciated that thC present invention has provided various emOc iments onstituting a shock absorbing steering wbc l ich neatly solves the vexatious problems associated with rapid shocks which would otherwise be transmitted to steering wheels. The various embodiments are readily adaptable to conventional equipment, all of these embodiments being mounted at the steering wheel itself so that minimum alterations of the steering wheel proper and normally connecting port are necessary. While any suitable resilient material or rubber can be used, the preferred material is polyurethane, in which case fabrication of the unit is extremely simple. Thus, for example, in the embodiments of Figures 51 6, 7, and 8, the first and second annular members themselves serve essentially as a mould for receiving the polyurethane in liquid form after the parts have been assembled as already described. In this respect, it will be understood of course that in the embodiments in which the annular volume is open at the bottom, the open bottom would be temporarily closed off with a flat plate during the moulding operation. In the case of the embodiment of Figures 9 and 10, there would of course have to be provided moulds for the material. It should be understood that appropriate electrical connect Dns between the first and second members, where requiredtwould be provided in the same manner described above for the embodiments ofFigures 2 to 4.
