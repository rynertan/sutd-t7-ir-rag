# CONTROL SYSTEM FOR A FLUID PRESSURE ENGAGED CLUTCH

## Abstract
Fluid pressure for engagement of a clutch 14 is controlled by valve means 15 alternating between supply and drain conditions in response to a high fre quency electrical square wave signal. The valve means 15 produce a low flow pilot pressure signal which con trols clutch engagement pressure through a valve 16 in corporating a piston 17 which allows clutch engagement pressure to drain whenever that pressure exceeds pilot pressure.
