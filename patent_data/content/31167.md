## Description
METHOD AND MOLD FOR CONSTRUCTING A CONCRETE FLOORThe invention relates to a method for constructing a concrete floor by combination of a deck with concrete casting on site, and to a module mold suitable for carrying out said floor constructing method.Proposals for covering a floor with concrete have heretofore been made by use of a plurality of temporary molds or forms to define spaces to be filled with concrete cast in situ, with removal of the molds after setting or by combination of a plurality of cross molds with concrete cast in situ. The use of temporary molds requires much labor such as assembly, removal, transportation, and storing as well as field materials such as supports and the like which cost much and have not been currently employed.On the other hand, a concrete floor covering using cross molds is made in such a manner that a plurality of as deposited molds is bridged over longitudinal beams on the lower floor with one series of the molds B being thinner than the other molds B to provide for zones which are to withstand heavy loads, as shown in Figs. 7 and 8, and that concrete C is then placeddver the molds. This requires edge plugs fitted between the ends B of the adjacent molds. These plugs are fitted between gaps defined by the adjacent molds and welded to them which involves much labor and cost and elevates the floor to a level D requiring a large quantity of concrete.The floor shown in Fig. 8 is framed by engaging pairs ofZ hangers E, E in the flanges of the respective beams A to receive the molds B between them on which concrete C is placed.The differences in thickness of the concrete layer depend on the lengths of the hangers in pairs. This floor covering provides a floor of small thickness and requires no edge plugs but needs the hangers E to be secured by welding thereby resulting in increased cost and labor. It it therefore desirable to lay a floor with a durable structure but in a simple manner and at a low cost.The features and advantages of the invention as claimed will become apparent upon consideration of the specification and the accompanying drawing, in which Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a surface horizontal type mold in accordance with the present invention partially broken off Fig. 2 is a perspective view of the mold of Fig. 1 viewed from the back Fig. 3 is a perspective view of a modified form of the mold Fig. 4 is a longitudinal section of the molds joined to each other Fig. 5 is a cross section of the molds on which concrete is placed Fig. 6 is a cross section of the molds each being provided with an abutment formed at the center of the mold andFigs. 7 and 8 are cross sections each showing the floor structure according to the prior art.Referring to the drawing, particularly Fig. 1, one embodiment of the invention is shown as a surface horizontal or flat surface mold 1 which includes a web 2 and a plurality of reinforcing ribs 5 extending downwards and spaced at a suitable interval W therebetween. Each of the ribs 5 comprises two divergent walls 3 and a base 4. Each of the webs 2 is provided at its opposite ends with a narrow deposit margin 6 and an insert piece 7 at a right angle, respectively.As shown in Fig. 2, the other opposite ends of the mold 1 are forced formed, compressed on the back of the mold to provide widths W in such a manner that the respective bases 4 lie flat upon the web 2 thus forming abutments 8 at the respective opposite ends.Fig. 3 shows a further embodiment of the present invention, wherein the other opposite ends of the mold 9 are forced formed, compressed from the opposite sides thereof or from above and below in such a manner that the web 2 and the basis 4 are deformed to form abutments 8 which are positioned between the web surface and the base faces thereby obtaining an elongated hexagon, if viewed from the side. If a mold is dimensioned to add one length L to the other lengthL of the mold 1 or 9, the intermediate portion of the mold 1 or 9 may be formed or pressed flat in such a manner that the ribs form an intermediate abutment 10 to be laid on the beam 11.The abutment 8 or 8 of the mold J or 9 fabricated as described above is engaged in and welded to the beam 11, as shown inFig. 5. In this manner, a plurality of molds may be arranged in line perpendicular to the axis of the beam. On the other hand, when a plurality of molds is arranged in file parallel to the axis of the beam, as shown in Fig. 4, the insert piece 7 of one mold 1 or 9 is mounted in the foremost rib 5 of the other mold 1 or 1 whereas the deposit margin 6 of one mold is placed under the web. After the molds are laid all over a certain floor, concrete 12 is placed on top to smooth its surface 13.The mold 1 or 9 is made of steel, stainless steel, aluminum, fiber reinforced plastics, etc. Although not shown in the drawing, it may be coated with a refractory material and include a basis 4,4 adapted for draining. Further, the web may be ribbed or slightly curved to prevent the web from deflecting due to the weight of the concrete.Fig. 5 shows a combination of two types to the molds such as the flat surface mold 1 and the crown surface mold 9. In this combination, the concrete may be placed in such a manner that it is rather thick on the flat surface mold to withstand a heavy load and thin on the crown surface mold to withstand a smaller load. For this reason, the flat surface mold is used for floors where heavy material or equipment is installed. Although the molds of the combination type are shown in Fig. 5 it is entirely a matter of choice depending on the nature of the building whether the flat surface mold or the crown surface mold is used.As described above, the flooring constructed in accordance with the present invention does not require edge plugs nor hangers which are necessary in the prior art methods, but the molds are simply arranged planar along the beams and concrete is placed thereon. No skill is required to execute the work because of the method s simplicity. Furthermore, no accessories are employed so that the trouble and labor of mounting, removal, and adjustment are fully eliminated.In addition, the reinforcing ribs 5 are formed on the backs of the molds to render thin steel materials withstandable to greater loads and to obtain a solid and optically pleasing concrete floor.
