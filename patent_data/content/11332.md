## Description
METHOD OF MAKING INSTANT TEA The present invention relates to a method of making instant tea and particularly concerns improving the cold, hard water solubility of soluble tea powders particularly suitable for use in iced beverages made with very hard tap water. It has been customary to prepare cold soluble tea powders or sediment free concentrates suitable for use in iced beverages by making hot water extracts made of tea or fermented tea leaves and cooling the same to a temperature of approximately 4 100C to precipitate the cream , which is then removed from the supernatant liquid. Alternatively, insoluble protein or other polyphenol adsorbants are added to the extracts in order to remove part of the oxidized polyphenols responsible for cream formation. The residual liquor is then concentrated to a syrup of desired consistency or dried to a powder.Such processes suffer from the disadvantage that the sediment free concentrate or dry powder yields a brew which does not reproduce the taste and strength associated with conventional black tea brew, because the cream or oxidized polyphenols removed in these processes are precisely the constituents which provide tea with its characteristic taste. Such teas are therefore described as flat . U.S. Patent 4,004,038, January 18, 1977, to Wickremaslnglle, discloses cold soluble tea concentrates and powders prepared by extracting tea leaves with hot water and selectively removing nonpolyphenolic, high molecular weight compounds from the tea extract while retaining the phenolic compounds therein and concentrating the resultant extract, U.S.Patent z. and Karas, April 4, 1951, discloses tne use of hort chain polyphosphates te prepare a soluble tea concen trate wherein the tea leaves are extracted with not water and polyphosphate is added to the aqueous ea extract to combine with substantially all of the calcium ions that wil. be present in the final tea beverage. But the tea beverage made hy Melzard et al.does not taste good due to the large amounts of the polyphosphate additives required to combine with the calcium ions present in most tap waters. Like polyphosphates, sodium bisulfite is known in instant tea processing art to have certain advantages and disadvantages. In a process described byI. I. Herz, U.S. Patent 2,831,772, April 22, 1958, assigned to Afico SA, a corporation of Switzerland, it is used to make a highly concentrated tea essence that readily dissolves in cold water for making iced tea. The method comprises preparing a hot clear liquid tea essence from tea leaves... and dissolving in said aqueous tea essence an amount of a systemically innocuous sulfite to render soluble in cold water the ordinarily cold water insoluble fraction of the tea essence and concentrating.... .While this patent teaches the use of bisulfite in hot tea extraction processes, resulting in cold water soluble tea products, many valuable tea aroma and flavor compounds are lost or destroyed. Like the Melzard et al. patent, the levels of additive bisulfite taught in Herz adversely affect delicate tea flavor and aroma balance..Such processes remove and or alter natural tea components.

In other words, theDesorbate tea of that application is completely soluble in cool 20 25 C distilled water which can then be iced.However, its solubility in cool tap water ranges from satisfactory in relatively soft tap water 4 grain to less satisfactory in harder tap water 7 grain and higher in which a slightly cloudy iced beverage is. obtained, which cloudiness icres upon stunAi.g, especially in the harder waters Summary of the Invention An object of the present invention is to provide a method of making a good looking glass of iced Desorbate instant tea that is substantially clear in very hard tap water. Another object of the present invention is to provide a method of making an improved cold hard water soluble instant tea. It has been discovered that fast freezing a tea extract will improve the cold hard water solubility of a freeze dried instant tea.

Detailed Description of Invention An improved, cold hard water soluble instant tea is made by a process comprising fast freezing a frigid fluid to plastic tea extract to a brittle solid state within about 15 minutes, grinding the solid and preferably freeze drying the cold ground particle to provide said improved cold hard water soluble instant tea. It has out discovered that fast freezing a tea extract will improve the cold hard water solubility of an appropriately dried instant tea. d water solubility uble by preparing a soi water soluble extracting tea leaves with water and wet steam using mild temperatures and low absolu e pressures d collecting a frigid fluid to plasti aqueou trap extract, having preferably from 82 to 202 t soj ds, Which may be subsequently concentrated by methods known to those skilled in the arts to 35 to 45 solids, and fast freezing said extract to a brittle solid as fast as possible within 15 minutes, grinding the solid, and freeze drying selected cold ground particles to provide an improved cold hard water soluble instant tea. A preferred starting material, the tea extract, for the present invention would provide a stable cool water soluble instant tea even without fast freezing. Preferably, too, the tea extract starting material is substantially a whole tea extract. A detailed description of an improvedDesorbate tea process to make such starting material is disclosed in copending patent application SerialNo. 936,951, filed August 25, 1978, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.Thus, preferred methods of the present invention comprising the steps of 1 passing steam through a columnar bed of ground tea leaves in such a manner so as to pre wet and pre swell an upper portion of said ground tea leaves in said bed, said bed being held at a temperature of below about 650C and an absolute pressure of about 13 mbar to about 400 mbar millibar 2 slowly passing water and wet steam through said bed in such a manner which avoids flooding of said bed and thereby providing a moving interface between wet swollen tea leaves and substantially dry tea leaves until. an initial aqueous tea extract breaks through said bed, said initial aqueous tea extract having a draw off weight ratio of extract to dry tea leaves of from 0.5 1 to 3 1, said bed being held at said temperature and said pressure until about 1 2 of said water and wet steam have been applied, and then maintaining a temperature in said bed below about 720C 3 collecting said initial aqueous tea extract in a cold trap to provide a frigid fluid to plastic tea extract, said cold trap being held at an absolute pressure of about 1 to about 613 mbar and a temperature from about 1800C to about 20 C 4 fast freezing said frigid fluid toplastic tea extract to a brittle solid, preferably within 10 minutes and more preferably within 5 minutes when the initial aqueous extract is col lenten ns a frigid liquid, e g. ot 20 C, it may be fast frozen imnediately with liquid nitrogen on the other hand, when the initial aqueous extract is collected in a partially frozen state it is then preferred to plasticize work it for uniformity and optimum results before fast freezing preferably, the frigid fluid to plastic tea extract is spread out in a layer of about 2.5 cm thickness, and most preferably about 1 to about 2 cm thickness and plunged into liquid nitrogen in drum freezing and belt freezing, correspondingly thinner layers of tea extracts are required for uniform fast freezing, which can be accomplished by liquid N2 or CO2 sprays 5 grinding said solid to a desired particle size and freeze drying said ground particles to provide an improved cold, hard water soluble instant tea. Other preferred embodiments of the present invention include a process wherein said pre wetted and pr swelled upper portion is about 1 to about 30e of sa d est pre is about 10 to about 5 of said bed. and wh rein said bed temperature is held below 550C and wherein said bed and said cold trap are both he d at an abs lute pressure of from about 13 nibar to about 40 r.Lar and at a temperature of below about 55 C and said cold trap at a temperature below about 10 C and a pressure of below about 400 mbar, and wherein said draw off ratio is from about 0.9 1 to about 2.5 1 and more preferably wherein said bed is held at an absolute pressure of about 25 mbar to about 300 mbar and wherein said cold trap temperature is below about 60 C or wherein said bed has an initial temperature of about 10 C and said cold trap has an initial temperature cold enough to trap a steam water desorbed tea aroma and flavor fraction in the form of a frost. Another preferred embodiment includes said process wherein C02 gas is pulsed through said bed during steps 1 and 2 to increase extraction yields.Of course, a mall amount of water can be used with said steam to pre wet and pre swell the dry tea leaves in step 1 . Fast freezing of a fluidto plastic tea extract having a concentration of at least about 8 is important to getting a preferred final dried product having a suitable density of aboutU.05 to 0.15 g cc, and more preferably 0.08 to about 0.12 g cc. Preferably, the initial extract as collected has a tea solids concentration of 8 or above. It should be noted that about 30 of the tea bed could be pre wetted and pre swelled. Preferably, the upper 10 to 25q, but as little as the upper 5 or 10 , of the bed can be pre wetted and pre swelled for improved Desorbate runs. The Desorbate tea without fast freezing is soluble in cool 20 25 C distilled water which can then be iced or the Desorbate tea without fast freezing can be dissolved in warm tap water 3A50C and then iced. However, its initial solubility in cool tap water ranges from satisfactory in relatively soft tap water 4 grain to less satisfactory in harder tap water 7 grain and higher in which a slightly cloudy iced beverage is obtained. Cloudiness increases upon standing, especially in the harder waters. Fast freezing is critical for cold hard water solubility with solution stability. The importance of maintaininy mild desorption temperatures is re emphasized. Low mild temperatures below 650C and preferably below 55 C should be main tained during at least the first half of a tea desorption run. Whereas coffee desorption can be advantageously executed at temperatures over 650C, it has been discovered that by kceping the temperature below 65 C and preferably below 55 C during the first 1 2 of a tea run, results in a dried instant with a milder and smoother flavor which surprisingly exhibits improved solubility in cooler water independent of fast freeze. The cold, hard water solubility of theDesorbate tea of this invention is surprisingly further improved by treating the process water with a minor but effective amount of an edible water soluble additive selected from the group consisting of suitable higher chain polyphosphates, sulfites, bisulfites and suitable carrageenans. A preferred additive is a lowcalcium lambda carrageenan. More preferred are alkali metal or ammonium sulfite and bisulfite. Most preferred of these is sodium bisulfite which is used at a level of 0.005 to 0.590, most preferably at 0.01t to 0.04 in the process water. Low calcium lambda carrageenan is also used at a level of 0.005t to 0.5 , and preferably at 0.01t to 0.02 , in the process water. The cold, hard water solubility and solution stability of Desorbate tea prepared by the process of this invention are best improved by treating the pro water with a t effective amount of a higher chain water soluble polyphosphate. As used herein, a high r chain polyphosphate contains about.15 to 100 phosphorus atoms pL molecule. Most preferable is Glass H , which averages 21 phosphorus atoms per molecule. Preferred polyphosphate treated water contains from about 0.00 to about 0.32 of said polyphosphate and more preferably said polyphosphate treated water contains from about 0.0190 to about 0.14 of said polyphosphate. An additional advantage is seen if a little polyphosphate water is sprinkled on a lower portion 5 or 10 of the tea bed when loading the desorption column before steaming.The structure of the preferred additive polyphosphate, also referred to as sodium phosphate glass, may be represented as follows EMI9.1 Glass H , the most preferred polyphosphate, has a chain length of n 21. Glass H may be obtained commer cially from FMC Corporation, Inorganic ChemicalDivision, 633 Third Avenue, New York 10017. FMC s technical bulletin 570 6A GLASS H is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.It has been found that the use of polyphosphates of a higher average chain length than Hexaphos 13 phosphorus atoms is critical to the preparation of Desorbate tea which is soluble in cold, hard water and at the same time retains a clean, fresh brewed tea like flavor, e.g., Desorbate tea made with process water which contains 0.022 by weight of Glass gives a clear solution in cool 200C , hard 9 grain w4e but the same water needs nearly 1 llexayohos Lo achieve this result, and the latter level of ilexaphos1 does not maintain clarity of solution solution stability upon standing, whereas Glass H does. Of course, other long chain polyphosphates which are edible and soluble in water other than Glass tX are useful in the practice of the present invention. Fast freezing the fluid to plastic tea extract to a brittle solid should be accomplished within 15 minutes, preferably within 10 minutes, and more preferably within 5 minutes. In other words, the extract is most preferably frozen to a brittle solid as fast as possible. Preferably, the fluid to plastic tea extract is spread out in a layer of about 2.5 cm thickness, and more preferably about 1 to about 2 cm thickness, and plunged into liquid nitrogen greater thicknesses have been found to be undesirable for uniform fast freezing in other eIbodiraents of the present invention, e.g. cryogenic drum fast freezing or cryogenic belt fast freezing, correspondingly thinner layers of tea extracts are required for uniform fast freezing. The foregoing detailed description of invention and the following examples further illustrate or highlight the best modes currently contemplated for carrying out the present invention, i.e. in the context of Desorbate tea technology, so it must not be construed as limiting the present invention in an unreasonable manner. Fast freezing 8 45 tea solids, aqueous tea extracts made via other methods, e.g. a slurry extraction method, reconstitution of dried tea solids, freeze concentration of lower solids extracts, etc., can improve cold hard water solubility of an appropriately dried instant tea made therewith. At higher concentration the aqueous tea extracts are preferably foamed before fast freezing by techniques known to those skilled in the art. EXAMPLE I Fast Freezing a Low Temperature Desorbate Tea i reparati.on Ten kg of a tea blend consisting of 60 Ceylon BOP, 30 Kenya BOP, and 10 India Assam BOP black teas, was ground on an American Duplex mill.An approximate particle size distribution is shown in the table following below. Tea Particle Size Distribution After Grinding Mesh Size Ground Tea Particles in Microns in 1680 0.0 1190 0.5 850 14.0 590 32.5 420 25.2 300 14.0 180 9.2 125 2.5 pan 2.0 The particle size distribution shown in the table above is to be maintained within a 15 deviation limit in the 850 to 420 range in order to maintain proper flowdrates during the desorption steps of processing. A 60 cm diameter desorption column was loaded with ground tea on a retaining layer consisting of a nylon netting and 8 layers of cheesecloth placed on top of the false bottom to prevent the falling of fine tea particles into the condenser. The first 10 of the dry tea leaves were sprayed with about 100 ml of water containing 0.3 Glass H before the remainder was loaded into the column. The retaining layers were wetted lightly with water immediately before loading the column. The ground tea was put into the column and spread out evenly to bed of uniform height throughout The column lid was lowered and the column evacuated to about 45 mbar millihar . At this point the column exit valve was closed and steam was applied through the nozzle system to pre swell the uppermost layers top 25 of the tea bed.Steam was applied until the pressure was increased to about 85 mbar. The pressure was then further increased to about 150 mbar by applying gaseous CO2 through the CO2 valve located in the lid section. Details about the water application, bed temperatures, head space temperatures of the column and the condenser and the vacuum in the column head are shown in Table I. The cold trap had a head temperature of about 400C starting and maintained at below about 0 C. Table I Desorption ParametersTime Col. Temperature, C.

Boiling process water which turns to wet steam, was then applied in spurts through the water valve, a solenoid valve7 actuated by a pre prograin d audio tape system. The time of the run as about 36 minutes.The initial aqueous tea extract was condensed in a partial frozen state.About 16.56 kg were collected which contained 12.4 tea solids. The draw off ratio of extract to dry tea was 1.656 1 yield 20.5 . The condenser trap 30 cm diameter was submerged in a liquid nitrogen bath. The initial aqueous tea extract was immediately removed from the condenser to a plastic bag and physically worked into uniform frigid fluid plastic, which took about 1 2 hour, and then spread out in a layer or about 2 cm on stainless steel pans and then frozen solid within a period of about 5 minutes by immersing the pans in liquid nitrogen. The solid was cold ground, sieved to get particles of 850 to 2800 microns, and freeze dried. This product was substantially soluble in cold 12 C hard 9 grain water and totally soluble in cool 20 250C hard water and showed solution stability upon addition of ice or upon standing at room temperature for three hours. EXAMPLE II A frigid to plastic tea extract like that ofExample I was prepared following the method therein except that untreated pure process water was used.The extract was fast frozen in about 5 minutes. The instant tea made from the freeze dried tea was initially as soluble as that of Example I but lacked its solution stability. commat commat commat commat commat commat commat commat commat commat commat Slow Freezing a Low Temperature Desorbate Tea Preparation at 40 A pan of frigid to plastic tea extract like that of Example I was frozen solid in about 4 hours The solid was ground the same as in Example I. This product was exceedingly less soluble in cold hard water than the fast frozen instant tea of Example Io Thus, a surprising improvement in cold water solubility was noted when the initial aqueous extract was collected under cryogenic or frigid conditions and promptly worked up, fast frozen and freeze dried.In general, it is preferred that the fast freezing time is less than 15 minutes and preferably within 10 minutes, including freezing time. Surprisingly, fast freezing is beneficial as a preceding step to freeze drying an aqueous extract having a tea solids concentration of from about 8 to about 20 and is optimum for extracts having tea solid concentrations of from about 9 to about 13.5 . EXAMPLE IV An aqueous tea extract containing 45 tea solids was prepared from reconstituted dry instant tea powder prepared by slow freezing in accordance withExample III. This reconstituted tea extract liquid was foamed by forcing CO2 therein under a pressure of about 900 pounds per square inch in a pressure vessel. The tea water CO2 mixture was permitted vie a valve to exit the pressure vessel into an agitated liquid nitrogen bath and was instantly fast frozen to a brittle foamlike solid. The cold brittle solid was cold ground and freeze dried. The resultant product showed improved cold, hard water solubility over the original slow frozen extract of Example III. Thus, fast freezing improved the hard, cold water solubility of the reconstituted slow frozen tea powder. Moreover, this fast frozen tea powder also had a density of Q.101 which is ideal for making a glass of iced tea with one teaspoon of tea powderBgD
