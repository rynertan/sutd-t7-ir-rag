The method generally involves first reacting under agitation zinc oxide and methacrylic acid in an amount of from about 0.5 to about 0.6 moles of zinc oxide per mole of methacrylic acid in a liquid aliphatic hydrocarbon dispersing medium to produce particles of zinc dimethacrylate in the liquid medium. Then, the particles of zinc dimethacrylate are recovered from the liquid medium and dried to produce the zinc dimethacrylate powder. In a further embodiment of the invention, vulcanizable polymeric compositions are provided which comprise a rubbery polymers selected from the group consisting of natural rubber, ethylene propylene copolymers, ethylene propylene diene terpolymers, styrene butadiene copolymers, nitrile rubbers, neoprene and blends thereof b from about 25 to about 85 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of said rubbery polymers of said zinc dimethacrylate having a surface area of from about 3.7 to about 5.4 m2 g or more and c a cure effective amount of a peroxide curing agent. Such polymeric compositions exhibit excellent strength and hysteresis characteristics in the cured state.Detailed Description of the Invention To prepare the zinc dimethacrylate powder, the zinc oxide and methacrylic acid are first brought together in a liquid aliphatic hydrocarbon dispersion medium which aids in dissipating the heat that is liberated by the exothermic reaction of the two materials. Preferably, the zinc oxide is first dispersed in the liquid medium and the methacrylic acid is then added to the dispersion while agitating. From about 0.5 to about 0.6 moles of zinc oxide per mole of methacrylic acid are employed in the reaction. Various liquid aliphatic hydrocarbons may be utilized as the liquid dispersion medium. However, it is preferred to utilize an alkane as the liquid dispersion medium and of the alkanes, hexane is especially preferred. A surprising aspect of the use of hexane as the dispersion medium is the finding that the zinc dimethacrylate powder produced by reaction in the hexane medium consistently exhibits the desired surface area characteristics even under varying conditions of agitation. While not essential, it is generally preferred to include a small amount of a nonionic surfactant in the dispersion medium as this aids in producing a fluid suspension which is pumpable and pourable. Various well known nonionic surfactants can be utilized for that purpose including silicone type surfactants and alkylaryl polyether alcohol types. Preferred nonionic surfactants are the alkylaryl polyether alcohols. Amounts of nonionic surfactant included in the dispersion medium may range from about 0.1 to about 1.0 , preferably 0.3 to 0.5 by weight based on the combined weight of zinc oxide and methacrylic acid. The reaction between the zinc oxide and methacrylic acid is preferably conducted at room or ambient temperature i.e., no added heat , under agitation and in the presence of the nonionic surfactant. This preferred reaction procedure produces a fluid suspension which as indicated above is both pumpable and pourable. If desired, the reaction can be conducted at temperatures of up to about 700C and without a surfactant. In this latter case, a slurry or thick paste is obtained which does not pour well. However, this procedure though not preferred, does not appear to degrade the finished product. Reaction times may vary considerably depending on factors such as batch size, degree of agitation and the like.In general, reaction times may range from about 4 to about 20 hours or more. In the preferred embodiment, as the reaction between the zinc oxide and methacrylic acid nears completion, the product takes on the form of a fluid suspension of zinc dimethacrylate particles in the liquid medium, whereas when the reaction is conducted at higher temperatures and without surfactant, the product takes on the form of a slurry of zinc dimethacrylate particles in the liquid medium. In any event, the second step in the method is to recover the particles of zinc dimethacrylate from the liquid medium. This can be accomplished by any convenient method.Thus, for example, the zinc dimethacrylate particles may be recovered by filtration which is preferred or by removal of the liquid medium as by evaporation. When the zinc dimethacrylate particles are recovered by filtration, it is often desirable and preferred to remove additional portions of the liquid medium by pressing the particles. Following the recovery step, the zinc dimethacrylate particles are dried to produce the zinc dimethacrylate powder.Drying can be accomplished by any conventional method. Thus, air drying and or vacuum drying can be utilized. It is often preferred to first air dry the particles and then vacuum dry in an oven at temperatures of from about 600C to about 700C. The zinc dimethacrylate product at this point is in the form of a lightly caked powder. If desired, the product can be used in that form as an adjuvant in compositions of the invention with good results. However, it is generally preferred to break up the lightly caked powder for ease of handling and blending with the rubbery polymers and other components to prepare the compositions of the invention. This can be accomplished in any known manner. Thus, for example, the lightly caked powder can be broken up by a suitable blender such as a Waring blender. While not essential, it is usually desirable and preferred to remove any exceptionally large particles from the powder by passing the powder through an appropriate sieve such as, for example, a number 50 mesh screen. The zinc dimethacrylate product prepared in accordance with the above process generally has an ash content of from about 30 to about 35 percent. Rubbery polymers which may be utilized as component a in the compositions of the invention include natural rubber ehtylene propylene copolymers ethylene propylene diene terpolymers in which the diene component is a nonconjugated diene such as 1,4 hexadiene, dicyclopentadiene, 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene and the like styrene butadiene copolymers i.e., SBR , nitrile rubber, neoprene and blends or mixtures thereof. One of the surprising and unexpected aspects of the composition of the invention has been the discovery that the use of the zinc dimethacrylate and peroxide components permits the cure of rubbery polymer blends which are normally regarded as cure incompatible. For example, it has been found that compositions containing blends of EPDM and nitrile rubber cure well and exhibit excellent strength. Another surprising aspect of the compositions of the invention is the discovery that compositions containing ethylene propylene rubber which contains no unsaturation also cure well and exhibit good strength characteristics. The zinc dimethacrylate utilized as component b of the composition is as indicated a zinc dimethacrylate powder having a surface area of from about 3.7 to about 5.4 square 2 meters per gram m g or more and an ash content of from about 30 to about 35 percent. The zinc dimethacrylate is prepared in accordance with the process described above. Amounts of zinc dimethacrylate employed may range from about 25 to about 85 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of rubbery polymers with preferred amounts being from about 50 to about 80 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of rubbery polymers. Compositions containing 25 parts by weight of zinc dimethacrylate or more when cured exhibit much lower hysteresis than conventional carbon black reinforced rubbers. Compositions containing 50 parts by weight of zinc dimethacrylate or more when cured exhibit excellent strength characteristics e.g., modulus, elongation and break strengths approaching the properties of high quality polyurethanes. Peroxide curing agents which may be used as component c include organic peroxides such as dicumyl peroxide, bis t butyl peroxy diisopropyl benzene, t butyl perbenzoate, di t butyl peroxide, 2,5 dimethyl 2,5 di t butyl peroxy hexane and the like. The preferred peroxide curing agents are bis t butyl peroxy diisopropyl benzene and dicumyl peroxide. Amounts of peroxide curing agents included in the compositions will depend upon the type rubber utilized and may generally be stated as cure effective amounts. In general, such amounts may range from about 0.2 to about 2.0 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of rubbery polymer. The compositions may optionally contain other conventional additives which are commonly utilized in rubber compositions. Such additives may include reinforcing agents and fillers such as carbon blacks, clays, silicas and calcium carbonate, process and extender oils, antioxidants, waxes, placticizers and the like. When it is desired to include such reinforcing agents and fillers in the compositions, these may generally be utilized in amounts of from about 5 to about 60 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of rubbery polymers.Other additives may be employed in amounts conventionally used in standard rubber compounds. The rubber compositions may be prepared by any conventional procedure such as, for example, by mixing the ingredients in an internal mixer or on a mill. The following examples are submitted for the purpose of further illustrating the nature of the present invention and are not intended as a limitation on the scope thereof.Parts and percentages referred to in the examples and throughout the specification are by weight unless otherwise indicated. The following examples i.e., 1 5 illustrate the preparation of zinc dimethacrylate by the process of the invention. Example 1 To each of fifteen 15 28 ounce beverage bottles were charged 300 grams of hexane. Then 37.5 grams of zinc oxide, previously passed through a number 50 mesh screen were added to the bottles with swirling. Following this addition, 77.5 grams of methacrylic acid were added to each bottle with continued swirling. The bottles were swirled and shaken every 1 2 minutes for 15 minutes. The contents gradually thickened.The bottles were then purged with nitrogen, capped and placed in a 500C polymerizer for approximately 2.5 days. The bottles were then removed from the polymerizer, cooled in water and opened. Following this procedure, the contents of the bottles were blown into a five gallon kettle with nitrogen. The contents of the kettle were then diluted with one gallon of hexane and stirred for 30 minutes. The resultant slurry was filtered in 5 portions each washed with 700 cc of hexane. The filter cakes were then placed in two large trays, broken up by hand and dried in a hood for 3 hours with frequent stirring. The trays were then placed in a vacuum oven operating at a temperature of 650C and at 0.01 to 0.05 mm Hg for 40 hours. The resultant zinc dimethacrylate in the form of a lightly caked powder was then broken up in aWaring blender and passed through a 50 mesh screen. Yield of product was 1525.5 grams. Analysis of the product for ash content showed it to contain 33.7 ash which compares to a theoretical ash content of 34.5 . The product was also subjected to differential thermal analysis DTA . Procedures for obtaining DTA curves are well known and are described in instrument manufacturers manuals and various texts. DTA of the product revealed a major endotherm peaking at 1770C and a minor endotherm peaking at 1410C. Example 2 To a 2 liter three necked flask equipped with a stirrer1 thermometer, nitrogen inlet and outlet was charged 792.0 grams of hexane, 99.0 grams of zinc oxide, 0.3 grams ofUcar Super Wetter FP, a nonionic organo silicone surfactant available from Union Carbide, 0.3 grams of L 522, a nonionic organo silicone surfactant also available from Union Carbide and 0.3 grams of DC190, a silicone glycol copolymer surfactant available from Dow Corning Corporation. The contents of the flask were stirred at 250 300 RPM for 23 hours. Then, 204.6 grams of methacrylic acid was added to the flask with stirring continued. Prior to this addition, the contents of the flask were at room temperature i.e., 270C . However, within one minute after addition of the methacrylic acid, an exotherm occurred which caused the temperature to rise to 420C. The temperature of the reaction mixture slowly dropped reaching a temperature of 350C after 30 minutes. The reaction was continued with stirring for a total of 18 hours. The resultant fluid suspension was filtered to recover the zinc dimethacrylate particles the particles were then washed with hexane, resuspended in 600 cc of hexane, filtered again and washed with hexane. The filter cakes were then placed in trays, dried in a hood and vacuum dried using substantially the same procedure set forth in Example 1. The resultant zinc dimethacrylate in the form of a soft powder was then passed through a 50 mesh screen. The product was analyzed for ash content and found to contain 34.36 ash which compares to a theoretical ash content of 34.5 . Example 3 To a 5 gallon openhead bucket equipped with a polypropylene liner, baffles placed between the liner and bucket, a high speed air motor with attached stirrer and thermometer was charged in sequence 12,000 cc of hexane, 3.44 cc of TritonX 15, 3.4 cc of Triton X 45, 3.4 cc of Triton X 100, 1008 grams of zinc oxide and 2062 grams of methacrylic acid. Triton X 15, X 45 and X 100 are nonionic octylphenoxy yc oxy ethanol surfactants available from Rohm Haas Company . Following addition of the methacrylic acid, a polyethylene cover was placed over the bucket to prevent loss of hexane by evaporation. The ingredients were added with vigorous stirring. Prior to the addition of methacrylic acid, the temperature inside the bucket was 270C i.e., room temperature . Within two minutes following the addition, an exotherm occurred which caused the temperature to rise to 440C.The contents of the bucket were vigorously stirred for 8 hours at which time the temperature had dropped to 400C. The degree of stirring was reduced slightly and the reaction continued for an additional 15 hours total reaction time 23 hours at which time the temperature had fallen to 360C. As the reaction neared completion, the contents in the bucket took on the form of a fluid suspension. The suspension was then removed from the bucket, filtered, and the recovered particles were washed, dried in a hood and in a vacuum oven 650C, 0.08 mm Hg as in Example 1. The resultant zinc dimethacrylate in the form of a lightly caked powder was then broken up in aWaring blender and passed through a 50 mesh screen. A sample of the product was analyzed and found to contain 33.6 ash. This example was repeated several times and the product from each run was combined. A sample of product from the combined runs was evaluated and found to have a nitrogen surface area of 4.5 m2 g and a calculated particle size of .78 microns see Explanatory Note . Nitrogen surface area was determined substantially in accordance with the procedure set forth in ASTM D3037, Method D which is titled Surface AreaBy Monosorb Analyzer with the significant exception that a degas temperature of 1000C was used instead of the 2000C degas temperature specified in the test see Explanatory Note . Explanatory Note The above example corresponds toExample 3 of Application Serial No. 421,012, the parent application of this application. In Example 3 of the parent, the nitrogen surface area is reported as 2.44 mê g and the calculated particle size is reported as 1.45 microns. The reason for the discrepancy is that in Example 3 of the parent the exact procedure of ASTM D3037, Method D, which was initially developed to measure the surface area of carbon black and includes a 2000C degas temperature was utilized.However, since the filing of the parent application, the applicants have discovered that the 2000C degas temperature causes a disruption of the surface area of zinc dimethacrylate powder thereby resulting in lower surface area values than are actual. However, the above results represent a retesting of the zinc dimethacrylate powder using the modified procedure. Example 4 To a l liter beaker equipped with a stirrer and thermometer was charged 391 mililiters ml of hexane, 0.11 ml each of Triton X 15, Triton X 45 and Triton X 100 and 32.8 grams of zinc oxide. Triton X 15, X 45 and X 100 are nonionic octylphenoxy polyethoxy ethanol surfactants available fromRohm Haas Company . The mixture was stirred for 5 minutes and 67.2 grams of methacrylic acid were then added to the beaker. Following this addition, stirring of the reaction mixture was continued for 23 hours with the temperature being less than 350C. The resultant fluid suspension was filtered to recover the zinc dimethacrylate particles which were then pressed as dry as possible and air dried overnight. Final drying of the resultant zinc dimethacrylate powder was conducted in a vacuum oven at 60 C. A sample of the zinc dimethacrylate powder obtained 2 showed a nitrogen surface area of 5.35 m g. Nitrogen surface area was determined in accordance with the modifiedASTM D3037, Method D, procedure utilized in Example 3 i.e., 1000C degas temperature . Example 5 In this example, Example 4 was substantially repeated except that additional agitation was provided using ultrasound. A sample of the resultant zinc dimethacrylate powder showed a nitrogen surface area of 4.98 mê g using the modified surface area procedures of Examples 3 and 4. Comparative Example A In this example, the procedure of Chem AbstractArticle 87 5403 Kobayashi et al. Japanese Kokai 76,138,616 , one of the principal references cited againstU.S. Application Serial No. 421,012, the parent application to the present application, was evaluated. The procedure employed to evaluate the Kobayashi et al. process was as follows To a 1liner flask equipped with stirrer and azeotrope trap with reflux condenser was charged 391 ml toluene and 32.8 grams of zinc oxide. The contents of the flask were stirred and warmed to about 500C and then 67.2 grams of methacrylic acid were added. A house vacuum line was attached through the top of the condenser and enough vacuum was applied to cause gentle refluxing. Reaction was terminated after 7 hours at 500C when no more water was collected in the azeotrope trays. The contents of the flask were then filtered, the precipitate pressed as dry as possible and air dried overnight.Final drying was conducted in a vacuum oven at 600C The resultant zinc dimethacrylate in the form of a fine white powder had a nitrogen surface area of 3.1 mê g as determined by the nitrogen surface area procedure of Examples 3 5.

The above formulations were mixed on a cold two roll mill. The mixed compounds were then cured and tested for stress strain properties.

Note these examples correspond toExamples A and B of the parent application and the surface 2 area of MPL 7742 reported therein was 0.73 m g by the original ASTM D3037 78, Method D procedure. Hence the above .960 m2 g surface area value represents a retest of MPL 7742. Two formulations containing MPL 7742 were prepared at different times and tested for stress strain properties.Compositional formulations designated Examples D and E and test results are shown in Table I a . For convenience in comparing the stress strain properties to those obtained by compositions of the invention, a vulcanizable polymeric composition of the invention designated Control, previously prepared and tested, is also included in the Table.

The effect of zinc dimethacrylate on hysteresis properties was evaluated using a conventional shear modulus test. In the shear modulus test, G represents shear modulus, G represents shear modulus loss and Tan is the ratio of shear modulus to shear modulus loss. Tan is regarded as an indication of hysteresis properties with low values indicating lower hysteresis and higher values indicating higher hysteresis.The compositions were mixed on a mill and cured and evaluated for shear modulus at low strain. Composition formulations, cure conditions, test conditions and shear modulus results are shown in Table VII.

This would appear to indicate a lower hysteresis property at higher modulus which is an unusual and unexpected result.
