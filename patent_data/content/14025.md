# Method and apparatus for measuring modulus of a plastic polymer.

## Abstract
The modulus of a plastic polymer is measured by extruding a strand of the polymer vertically downward through an orifice while accurately measuring the diameter of the strand, cutting off the strand and weighing it, and dividing the strand weight by the square of the difference in strand diameter to give a quotient representative of the modulus of the polymer. The method and apparatus are especially useful in measuring the green strength of a vulcanizable elastomer, so as to characterize its behavior during processing into a finished article.
