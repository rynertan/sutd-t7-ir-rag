## Description
Method for determining glucose content of fluid This invention relates to a method for determining the glucose content of a fluid and to a glucose assay mixture which can be used in the method. In particular the invention relates to a method and a glucose assay mixture for determining the glucose content of physiological fluids such as blood. The measurement of glucose in physiological fluids such as blood is carried out extensively in hospitals. Several assay methods are available for this including enzymatic colorimetric and chemical methods. Rnzymatic assay methods are preferred.The enzymatic method most favoured at present uses the enzymes glucose oxidase and peroxidase and is dependent upon measuring liberated hydrogen peroxide. This method has a number of disadvantages including a it is complicated, requiring two enzymes, and b it is subject to possible interference arising either from decomposition of hydrogen peroxide by catalase from samples or non specific reactions of the peroxidase such that the hydrogen peroxide reacts with serum components rather than in the required manner. According to the present invention we provide a method for determining glucose present in a fluid wherein a sample of a glucose contsining fluid is contacted with an assay mixture com prising a pyrroloquinone dependent glucose dehydrogenas e enzymeE.C. Enzyme Commission No. 1.1.99.17 or a flavin dependent glucose dehydrogenase enzyme E.C. enzyme Commission No. 1.1.99.10 and a reducible compound, reduction of which can produce changes in electro magnetic radiation absorbance characteristics and or electrical changes, in an appropriate buffered medium0 Further according to the invention we provide a glucose assay mixture which comprises a pyrroloquinone dependent glucose dehydrogenase enzyme E0C0 enzyme Commission NoO 1.1.99.17 or a flavin dependent glucose dehydrogenase enzyme E,C, Enzyme Com mission No. 1.1.99.10 and a reducible compound, reduction of which can produce changes in electro magnetic radiation absorbance characteristics and or electrical changes. The E0C. En,yue Commission Nos. specified above are enzyme numbers assigned to enzymes in the Rnzyme Nomenclature of the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistxy NC nTS , Suitably the reducible compound is one whose reduction may be monitored either by measuring a change in the electromagnetic radiation absorbance characteristics and or by electronic means whereby a flow of electrons may be transferred from the com pound to an electrode system thus producing an electric current.When the reducible compound is one whose reduction is monitored by measuring a change in electro magnetic radiation obsorbance characteristics e.g. spectrophotometrically that compound will be a dye. Certain compounds may be usable as reducible compounds in either respect, i.e. may be dyes and also compounds whose reduction can produce electrical changes to be monitored by electronic means. The method of the invention can be used to determine the concentration of glucose in any glucose containing fluid. In particular the method is useful for determing the glucose concentration in blood and in other physiological fluids. It is however useful for determining the glucose concentration in a wide range of other glucose containing fluids including industrial process fluids, for example in processes for the production of glucose isomerase, and waste water. The method of the invention employs a reaction mechanism in which the enzyme glucose dehydrogenase effects oxidation of glucose to gluconolactone which is subsequently hydrolysed to gluconic acid0 This reaction mechanism releases two electrons from each molecule of glucose. The electrons released from glucose molecules pass to molecules of the reducible compound which is thus reduced and provide the basis for the absorbance and or electrical changes which enable the reaction to be monitored. For instance in the presence of a suitable dye com pound the released electrons from glucose molecules reduce molecules of the dye compound thereby producing a change in the electro magnetic radiation absorbance characteristics of the medium which can be measured using e.g. a spectrophotometer. Preferably the change in absorbance characteristics is a colour change measureable in the visible region of the spectrum. The extent of the change in absorbance characteristics can be determined using a spectrophotometer to measure the change in optical density at a suitable wavelength. For direct electronic detection, the reaction mixture contains an inert solid electrode ergo platinum or suitably treated carbon which is capable of accepting electrons from the reducible compound and which forms one electrode of a cell. The cell is cannected by a second electrode at which a reduction reaction can occur e.g. a silver silver chloride, standard calomel electrode or platinum in ferricyanide , A salt bridge makes a liquid connection between the two electrode systems.The rate of the glucose oxidation reaction may be monitored directly amperometrically. Alternatively the change in concentrations of the reduced and oxidised form of the reducible compound may be followed potentionetrically. Preferably the method of the invention is carried out using the assay mixture of the invention. This can be done by taking a prepared assay mixture and adding it to the glucosecontaining fluid under examination, buffering the medium in a suitable manner, Alternatively the assay mixture can be made up in situ by adding the components to the glucose containing fluid and buffering. The glucose dehydrogenase enzymes may be obtained from any microorganism containing these enzymes. Microorganisms containing these enzymes and which can usefully be used as sources for them include strains of Acetobacter, Acinetobacter,Gluconobacter and Pseudomonas as sources of E.C. 1.1.99.17 and Aspergillus as sources of E.C. 1.1.99.10. A preferred source of E.C. 1.1.99.17 is a strain of the species Acinetobacter calcoaceticus particularly strain NCTC 7344 this strain is deposited at and is freely available from the National Collection of qype Cultures NCTC, Central Public Health Laboratory, ColindaleAvenue, London .Preferred sources of E.C. 1.1.99.10 include Aspergillu3 oryzae strain ATCC 9102 which is deposited at and freely available from the American Xype Culture Collection AUCC, 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Maryland 20852, USA. When used in the method of the invention the enzyme may be in any form, e.g. purified enzyme, in a crude cellular extract or contained in whole microorganism cells. It may be immobilised in whole cells, immobilised in columns, used as a soluble enzyme or in any other suitable manner. The glucose dehydrogenase enzyme E.C. 1.1.99.17 is a pyrroloquinone dependent enzyme and contains a pyrroloquinone as a prosthetic group within ito The pyrroloquinone is a compound containing the structure EMI4.1 Usually the pyrroloquinone has a structure similar to that of methoxatin i.eO EMI4.2 The glucose dehydrogenase enzyme E.C. 1.1.99.10 is a flavin dependent enzyme and contains the prosthetic group flavin adenine dinucleotide yVD o The reducible compound can be any suitable compound which can be reduced by the electrons liberated by the glucosedehydrogenase catalysed oxidation of glucose and which either produces a change in electromagnetic radiation absorbance characteristics or enables electrons to be donated to a solid electrode sensor. Preferably, when a dye compound is used, the absorbance characteristics change produced is in the visible region of the electro magnetic spectrum, i.e. between 450 nm and 700 nm. A preferred dye compound is the oxidised form of 2,6 dicillorophenol DCPIP .Reduction of these dye compounds produces colour changes in the visible region of the spectrum which can conveniently be measured at 600 nm using a spectrophotometer.In addition to the preferred dye compounds other suitable compounds include compounds having redox potentials of less than 100 mV. The glucose assay mixture of the invention preferably comprises a freeze dried mixture of glucose dehydrogenase enzyme, with a suitable dye compound and buffer. The buffer may be any suitable physiologically compatible buffer. The amounts of the various components in typical assay mixtures are in the following ranges glucose dehydrogenase 10 to 200 units ml 2, 6 dichlorophenol indophenol 10 100 buffered to pE 5.5 9.0The freeze dried mixture is suitably provided in a vial which can be opened and water added to the mixture to give the concentrations indicated. In performing the method for determining glucose of the invention the assay mixture in a suitable buffered medium is prepared and a fluid sample, e.g. a sample of blood serum, is added to it in a conventional manner. Preferably 0.5 to 50 K of the sample or equivalent larger volume of diluted material is added to 0.1 to 5 ml of buffered medium. Blood serum which will be a common material to be tested is formed by removing cells from blood. After addition of the sample, e.g. of serum, to the buffered medium spectrophotometric measurements are made at a suitable wavelength erg. 600 nm and the glucose content of the test sample is determined0 It is also possible to use the method of the invention with paper test strips for blood, urine or serum assays. In this instance a dye compound is used.Preferably it is a mixture of nitro blue tetrazolium and phenazine methosulphate or phenazine ethosulphate. In the presence of glucose the nitro blue terra zolium changes from colourless to dark purple. Phenazine ethosulphate is a compound which can be used either as a dye compound or as a reducible compound, reduction of which can produce electrical changes. The method of the invention has advantages in that it uses only one enzyme which need not be purified to an excessively high standard and it avoids the use of highly carcinogenic and toxic chemicals. The glucose dehydrogenase enzyme E.C. 1.1.99.17 which can be used in the method of the invention does have some lesser activity on other sugars e.g. galactose and mannose but this is not significant under the assay conditions. The Michaelis Constant Em is that concentration of the substrate for an enzyme at which the enzyme catalysed reaction proceeds at half its theoretical maxinrum rate at saturating infinite substrate concentration. The constant for glucose dehydrogenase E.C. 1.1.99.17 from Acinetobacter is approximately 2 mM. The constant for E.C. 1.1.99.10 from Asnergillus oryzae is approximately 20 mM0 The consequence of this is that the useful range in which the reaction rate is linearly proportional to substrate concentration differs by a factor of 10 for these two enzymes.Thus when the concentrations to be determined are small it is preferred to use the enzyme having the lower Zm, i, i.e. in this instance E.C. 1.1.99.17. Conversely when, as is often the case with serum samples, the concentrations to be determined may be relatively high it is preferred to use the enzyme having the higher gm, i.e. in this instance E.C. 1.1.99.10. The invention is illustrated by the following Examples EgAMPIE 1Production and use of assay mixture containing glucose dehydrogenaseE.C. 1.1.99.17 derived from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus strain NCTC 7844 a Enzyme wlification Frozen cell pellet of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus strain NCTC 7844 was re suspended in phosphate buffer 50 mM, pH 7.0 and the cells were broken by sonication 3 x two minute bursts separated by two minute intervals .The cell debris was then removed by centrifugation at 50,000 rpm for 60 minutes and the resulting liquid was dialyzed overnight against 50 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 before being applied to a DEME Sepharosen column pre equilibrated with the same buffer. Under these conditions glucose dehydrogenase enzyme is not bound to the column whereas most of the impurities associated with the enzyme are bound to the column. The enzyme therefore passes through the column and fractions containing the enzyme were recovered. The purified enzyme thus produced was concentrated and stored. The crude extract before purification using the DEBE sepharose column had a specific activity of 0.68 P mol per minute per mg protein. The purified material after the treatment described above had a specific activity of 3.2 P mol per minute per mg protein i.e. there was an approximately five fold increase in specific activity as a result of purification with a recovery of 89 of the enzyme applied to the column. The purified enzyme material was used in the production of a glucose assay mixture. b glucose assay Using purified enzyme prepared as described above, the following glucose assay mixture was prepared glucose dehydrogenase 30 m units ml assay mixture 2,6 dichlorophenol indophenol 50 K phosphate buffer added to pH 6 50 mMWater being added to give the concentrations indicated. N3 The standard international unit of enzyme activity is 1 p mol per minute per mg protein. The reaction was commenced by addition of a glucose containing sample 0 0.15 mM in the assay mixture and the rate of the reaction was determined by monitoring the absorbance at 600 nm for approximately 1 minute. The initial rate was determined by extrapolation. The results obtained are shown graphically in Figure 1 and were obtained using a series of solutions of pure glucose in water or standardised serum samples containing known concentrations of glucose. In each case 10 pl of sample were added to a reaction volume of 1 ml. The reaction rate was directly proportional to the glucose concentration over the range studied and the results obtained with the serum samples were in good agreement with those obtained using pure glucose solutions. In the graph shown in Figure 1 initial absorbance decrease per minute at 600 nm is plotted as ordinate against glucose concentration in mM in the assay mixture as abscissa. The points on this graph are shown as follows points obtained using glucose standards in distilled water, r points obtained using standard sera obtained from Burrollghs Wellcome. EXAMPLE 2Production and use of assay mixture containing glucose dehgdrogenase derived from AsPergillus oryzae ATOC 9102 a enzyme purification Frozen cell pellet of AsPergillus oryzae ATOC 9102 was re suspended in phosphate buffer 50 nm pH 7.0 and the cells were broken by sonication with glass beads 0o5 mm diameter in 4 two minute bursts separated by two minute intervals. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 50,000 rpm for 60 minutes and the resulting liquid was dialysed overnight against 50 nm phosphate buffer pH 7.0 before application to a EAE Sepharose column pre equilibrated with the same buffer.The glucose dehydrogenase was not bound to the column whereas the bulk of impurities were found under these conditions. The enzyme therefore passed through the column and fractions containing the enzyme were recovered.The purified enzyme so obtained was concentrated and stored. The crude extract before purification using the nmAw sephrose had a specific activity of 0.02 P mol per minute per mg protein which was increased by the treatment described to 0.16 mol per minute per mg protein an approximately 8 fold purification with recovery of 924 0 of the enzyme applied to the column. The purified material was used in production of the glucose assay mixture. b Glucose assay Using the enzyme prepared as above the following glucose assay mixture was prepared glucose dehydrogenase 25 m units ml assay mixture 2, 6 dichlorophenol indophenol 100 phosphate buffer pH 6.5 50 mM dissolved in water to give the concentrations indicated The reaction was initiated by addition of a glucose containing sample giving a concentration of 0 2 mM in the assay mixture and the reaction rate was determined by following the decrease in absorbance at 600 nm. The initial reaction rate was determined. The results are shown graphically in Figure 2 and were obtained using a series of solutions of pure glucose in water.The reaction rate was linearly proportional to glucose concentration over the range studied and results obtained with serum samples not shown were in good agreement with those obtained using pure glucose. In the graph shown in Figure 2 initial rate of decrease in absorbance per minute at 600 nm is plotted as ordinate against concentration of glucose mM in the assay mixture as abscissa.
