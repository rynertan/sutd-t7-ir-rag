# Cutting apparatus.

## Abstract
A cutting apparatus for cutting objects 29 into minute pieces with high exactitude and high precision comprises, as an integral unit, a pair of cutter shafts 9, 10 disposed substantially in parallel to each other, a motor 21 attached to one of the cutter shafts 9 , means 17, 18 for rotating the other cutter shaft 10 in a direction opposite to the direction in which the one cutter shaft is rotated, a plurality of substantially disklike cutters 12 fitted around each of the cutter shafts, and a plurality of substantially disklike spacers 13 fitted around each of the cutter shafts. The cutters 12 and the spacers 13 around each of the cutter shafts 9, 10 are alternately arranged and brought into intimate contact with each other in the axial direction of each of the cutter shafts. The cutters 12 and the spacers 13 around the one cutter shaft 9 are closely opposed respectively to the spacers 13 and the cutters 12 around the other cutter shaft 10 so as to hold the cutters 12 in mesh with the opposed spacers 13 . The cutting apparatus further comprises a dish shaped shoot 19 which is disposed at a position immediately above the cutters 12 and spacers 13 for effectively guiding the objects 29 onto the cutters and the spacers to enhance the cutting efficiency, and a pair of scrapers 30 which are disposed on the sides intervening therebetween the side on which the cutters and the spacers are opposed and which are provided with corrugated engaging pawls 31 for engaging with the cutters and the spacers to effectively prevent the objects 29 from falling from between the cutters and the spacers.
