# Preparation of molded lignocellulosic compositions using an emulsifiable polyisocyanate binder and emulsifiable carboxy functional siloxane internal release agent.

## Abstract
A binder system is provided for the preparation of lig nocellulosic composite molded articles, such as flake or parti cle board, which incorporates an internal release agent and comprises an emulsifiable organic di or polyisocyanate and an emulsifiable carboxy functional siloxane. The emulsifiable carboxy functional siloxane is preblended with the di or polyisocyanate providing for increased mold release proper ties.
