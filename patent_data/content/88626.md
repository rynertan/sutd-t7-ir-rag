# APPARATUS FOR CONTROLLING THE SPEED OF A ROTATING BODY

## Abstract
A closed loop system for precisely regulating the speed of an electrically driven rotating body. A tachometer rotor 53 mechanically linked to the rotating body is provided with p teeth 55 around its periphery. A sensor 57 produces a pulse signal upon passage of each of these teeth, to generate a cyclic tachometer signal having a frequency p times the frequency of rotation. A tachometer counter 5 counts this signal and produces a single output pulse after every n x p pulses from the sensor, such that the same one of the p teeth is responsible for triggering each of the successive output pulses, and variations in spacing between teeth do not cause variations in the period of the counter output. A high frequency clock 17 is counted by a second coun ter 14 which transfers its count to a storage register 23 and resets upon each pulse from the tachometer counter 5 , such that the count held by the storage register is a continuously up dated, highly accurate digital respresentation of the period of the rotating body. A period comparator 39 derives a speed control signal which is proportional to the inverse of the dif ference between the count and a digital speed command signal representative of the rotational period at the desired rotational speed.
