# Hydrogen generators and a control system for hydrogen generators.

## Abstract
A replaceable cartridge hydrogen generator, of the type which relies at least partially on the process of anodic corrosion to produce hydrogen, has an outer container wall 68 which holds a consumable anodic material 62 and an electrolyte 72 therein. The container wall can be made the cathode of the cell. The container and anodic material can be cylindrically shaped and placed in an upright position when in use to have the electrolyte cover the anodic material. A control system for a hydrogen generator having a consumable anode, a cathode and an aqueous electrolyte therebetween, includes a circuit means which enables electrical current to pass between the anode and cathode in addition to the electrolyte. A control means in the circuit means can be regulated to selectively enable current to pass through the circuit means to produce hydrogen. Optionally, the control system also includes a hydrogen consuming device.
