# Copying process.

## Abstract
A copying process in which a pattern of charged and uncharged areas is superimposed on a charge image by charging and exposing image wise an electrophotographic element which is provided with a charge transporting top layer having therebeneath a charge generating layer which can inject charges in the charge transporting top layer at areas corresponding to said pattern of uncharged areas, but cannot inject charges at the other areas of the charge transporting top layer. The charge image is developed with a developing powder having a resistivity of less than 10¹² Ohms.cm and the resulting powder image is transferred to a receiving material and fixed thereon. The pattern of charged and uncharged areas is provided to produce uniform light grey image parts.
