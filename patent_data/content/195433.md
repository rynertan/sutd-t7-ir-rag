## Description
AMIDE DERIVATIVES, PROCESSES FOR PREPARING THEM AND USE THEREOF BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to amide derivatives obtained from sulfur containing amines and aliphatic acids, as well as a process for producing such derivatives. Both of the alkylated heavy and light chains H and L chains in human serum IgG have been found to have strong activities against ulcers in digestive tracts and against inflammation. While various proposals have been made with a view to explaining the mechanism behind these activities, one established observation is that the marked activity of the H and L chains in inhibiting the secretion of gastric juice is involved in their action against ulcers in digestive tracts T. Mimura, T. Terada et al J.Pharm. Dyn., 6, 397 1983 . As for their antiinflammatory activity, it has been discovered that inhibition of permeation through blood vessels and that of leukocyte migration are involved in that phenomenon.Several researchers have suggested the involvement of the SH groups at the hinge region of IgG as the active component of each of the H and L chains. SUS LARK OF THE INVENTION One object of the present invention is to provide a novel compound having activities against ulcers in digestive tracts and against inflammation. Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for producing such novel compound. In the past, the present inventors have conducted various researches with a view to producing compounds having activities against ulcers in digestive tracts and against inflammation. In the course of these efforts, the inventors successfully created amide derivatives by means of combining sulfur containing nines with C5 C18 unsaturated aliphatic acids through amide bonds. Surprisingly enough, the amide derivatives created were found to have superior activities against ulcers in digestive tracts and against inflammation. The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of these findings. Therefore, in one aspect, the present invention relates to an amide derivative having a sulfur containing amine i.e., an amino compound containing one or more sulfur atoms combined with a C5 C1 unsaturated aliphatic acid by one or more amide bonds. Stated more specifically, the amide derivative is characterized in that the amino group in the sulfur containing amino compound is bonded to the carboxyl group in C5 C18 unsaturated aliphatic acid by means of an amido bond. If the amide derivative of the present invention contains an SH group, a compound wherein said SH group is alkylated is also included within the scope of the definition of the derivative unless otherwise noted, the term amide derivative which will be used hereinafter shall include such SH alkylated compounds. It should also be mentioned that the alkyl group in an alkylated compound may be a substituted alkyl group. Illustrative alkyl groups are listed below the term lower used throughout this specification shall be construed as assuming the presence of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, unless otherwise noted . 1 lower alkyl groups such as methyl, ethyl and n propyl 2 N,N di lower alkyl carbamido lower alkyl groups such as N,N diethyl carbamidomctyl 3 lower alkoxycarbonyl lower alkyl groups such as ethoxycarbonylmethyl and ethoxycarbonylethyl 4 carboxy lower alkyl groups such as carboxymethyl and carboxyethyl 5 cyano lower alkyl groups such as cyanomethyl 6 ss amino lower alkyl groups such as CH2CH2NH2 7 benzoyl lower alkyl groups such as CH2COC6H5 8 carboxamide lower alkyl groups such as CH2CONH2 and 9 lower alkyl groups substituted with 5 or 6 membered nitrogen containing heterocyclic rings which may optionally contain an oxygen atom such as piperidine, pyrrolidine, morpholine and imidazole being preferred substituents. Any amino compounds having one or more sulfur atoms may be used as the sulfur containing amine in the present invention without any particular limitation.Preferably one or two amino groups are present in the sulfur containing amine. Specific examples of the sulfur containing amine include cystine, cysteine, cystamine, cysteamine, taurine, methionine, ethionine and lanthionine, with cystamine and cysteamine being particularly preferred. The sulfur containing amine may be a compound wherein the SH group present is substituted with one or more of the alkyl groups listed above. Any unsaturated aliphatic acid that has 5 18 carbon atoms, preferably 8 13 carbon atoms, may be used in the present invention without any particular limitation. The unsaturated bond is preferably a double bond. There is no particular limitation on the number of unsaturated groups present in the unsaturated aliphatic acid but those having 1 3 unsaturated groups are preferable. There is also no particular limitation on the position of unsaturated groups. Preferred unsaturated aliphatic acids are those which are represented by the following formula CH3 CH2 mCH CH CH2 nCOOH where m n is an integer of 1 14, provided that m is preferebly an integer of 1 9 and n is preferably 0 or 1. Specific examples of the unsaturated aliphatic acid that may be used in the present invention include 2 octenoic acid, CH3 CH2 4CH CHCOOH 2 decenoic acid, CH3 CH2 6CH CHCOOH 2 undecenoic acid, CH3 CH2 7CH CHCOOH and 2 tridecenoic acid, CH3 CH2 9CH CHCOOH. In a preferred embodiment, the amide derivative of the present invention is a compound represented by the general formula I CH3 CH2 pCH CH CH2 qCONH A S X I wherein p q is an integer of 1 14 A is an alkylene group X is a hydrogen atom, a carboxamidoalkyl group or CH3 CH2 pCH CH CH2 gCONHAS wherein p, q and A each has the same meaning as defined above . In formula I , p q represents an integer of 1 14, preferably an integer between 1 and 9 p is preferably an integer of 1 14, with an integer between 4 and 9 being particularly preferable q is preferably 0.The alkylene group denoted by A is preferably a straight or branched chain alkylene group having 1 3 carbon atoms, such as methylene or ethylene, with the ethylene being particularly preferred. The amide derivative of the present invention may be produced by a variety of known amidation techniques for example, the unsaturated aliphatic acid or a reactive derivative thereof may be reacted with the sulfur containing amine, optionally in the presence of a dehydrating agent. Illustrative reactive derivatives of the unsaturated aliphatic acid include acid halides e.g. acid chloride and acid bromide , active esters, and acid anhydr ides. Examples of the dehydrating agent that may be used in the reaction include N,N disubstituted carbodiimides e.g. N,N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and N,N carbonyldiimidazole. The reaction between the unsaturated aliphatic acid or a reactive derivative thereof with the sulfur containing amine may be carried out in the presence of an inert solvent. Suitable inert solvents include ethyl acetate, chloroform and ether. The reaction time generally ranges from 30 minutes to 4 hours, and the reaction temperature is typically within the range of about 0 to 500C. The unsaturated aliphatic acid is typically used in an amount ranging from about 1 to 3 moles per mole of the sulfur containing amine. The dehydrating agent, if it is used at all, is preferably incorporated in the reaction system in an amount of about 1 to 3 moles per mole of the sulfur containing amine. A reactive derivative, say, an acid halide, of the unsaturated aliphatic acid is typically prepared by treating the aliphatic acid with phosphorus trichloride, phosphorus pentachloride or, more preferably, with thionyl chloride in a weight ratio of the acid to thionyl chloride which ranyes from 1 1 to 1 5. The treatmet is preferably accomplished by means of reaction at 40 800C for a period of 4 29 hours. The resulting acid halide can be purified by a suitable technique such as distillation. The amide derivative of the present invention may have an SH group in this case, it may be converted to an alkylated form. If the amide derivative contains a disulfide S S group, the latter may be reduced to an SH group before the derivative is converted to an alkylated form. Conversion of these particular types of the amide derivatives to the corresponding alkylated forms may be carried out by any known alkylation technique e.g. Biochemistry, 7 5 , 1950 1958 1968 . The amide derivative synthesized by the procedures described above may be isolated and purified by any known technique such as phase transfer, recrystallization or chromatography. The amide derivative of the present invention exhibits superior activities against ulcers in digestive tracts in mammals e.g. humans, horses, dogs, mice and rats and against inflammation in these animals.Therefore, this compound has potential utility for pharmaceuticals effective against ulcers or inflammations. The amide derivative of the present invention may be administered either orally or parenterally in the form of a pharmaceutical preparation as combined with an appropriate and conventional pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The preparation may assume any conventional dosage form such as a tablet, capsule, powder, suppository or an injection. For oral administration, the amide derivative of the present invention is typically administered in an amount of 10 100 mg human daily in one or more doses. But it should be noted that the exact dose of the compound can vary with the age of the patient, his body weight and or the severity of the disease to be treated or the patient s response to the therapy. ExPeriment 1 1 Activity in Inhibiting the Secretion of Gastric Juice The activity of each of the test compounds in inhibiting the secretion of gastric juice was measured by pyloric ligation in accordance with the method of Shay et al. described in H. Shay, S.A. Komarov, S.S. Fels et al. Gastroenterology, 5, 43 1945 . Groups each consisting of 8 10 Wistar male rats weighing 150 200 g which had been starved for 48 hours were subjected to abdominal incision under ether anesthetization. After pyloric ligation, the incised abdomen of each animal was closed and the animal was kept away from food and water for 4 hours. The test compound was suspended in 5 gum arabic in physiological saline to give a concentration of 5 mg ml, and the suspension was administered intraperitoneally to each rat in a dose of 25 mg kg immediately after the closure of the incised abdomen.Four hours later, each rat was sacrificed with chloroform and the stomach was extracted. The gastric juice contained in the stomach was withdrawn and checked for its volume, total acidity and total pepsin activity. The total acidity was determined by titration with 0.02N NaOH using phenolphthalein as an indicator.The total pepsin activity was determined in accordance with the method of Anson Brit. J. Pharmacol., 13, 54 1958 using casein as a substrate. The results are shown in Table 1. Table 1 Total Acid Total Peptic Gastric Volume Output Activity ml 100 g wt.

Immediately thereafter, 150 mg kg of aspirin suspended in 5 gum arabic was administrered orally to each rat which was simultaneously injected with a selected test compound 20 mg kg intraperitoneally. The rats were kept away from food and water for 7 hours. Thereafter, the stomach was extracted from each animal under ether anesthetization and fixed in formalin.The total length of the ulcers occurring in the glands of the extracted stomach was measured and used as an ulcer index. 3 HCL Ethanol Ulcer HCl ethanol ulcers were induced in Wistar male rats in accordance with the method described in S. Okabe,S. Ueki et al. Oyo Yakuri, 27, 829 1984 . The procedures of 2 were repeated except that 2 hours after the intraperitoneal injection of a selected test compound, 1.5 ml of 15 mM HC1 in 60 ethanol was aaministrered orally to each rat, which thereafter was kept for an additional 1 hour. 4 Stress Ulcer Stress ulcers were induced in Wistar male rats in accordance with the method described in K. Takagi andS. Okabe Jpn. J. Pharmacol., 18, 9 1968 . The procedures of 2 were repeated except that the rats were restrained immediately after the administration of a selected test compound and immersed in water 22 10C for 7 hours. 5 Acetic Acid Ulcer Acetic acid ulcers were induced in Wistar male rats in accordance with the method described in K. Takagi,S. Okabe et al., Jpn. J. Pharmacol., 19, 418 1969 . Starting on the day of operation, each of the test compounds was administered orally to each rat for 14 consecutive days on a two dose a day basis. The rats were starved for 24 hours after administration of the final dose. They then were sacrificed with chloroform and the stomach was extracted from each animal and fixed in formalin. The product of the length and breadth of each stomach was determined and used as an ulcer index. The results are summarized in Tables 2 and 3.
