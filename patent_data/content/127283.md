# Catalytic conversion system for oligomerizing olefinic feedstock to produce heavier hydrocarbons.

## Abstract
An improved continuous catalytic process is provided for oligomerizing lower olefins to heavier hydrocarbons wherein a continuous liquid olefinic feedstream is diluted with a liquid alkane stream. Such a process is improved by a technique which comprises cooling catalytically converted effluent, frac tionating the effluent to obtain a condensed lower aliphatic recycle stream, a liquid C₃ C₄ product stream, a liquid product stream consisting essentially of C₅ hydrocarbons and a gaseous C₂ gaseous stream, by the sequential fractionation steps of debutanizing the cooled effluent to obtain the liquid C₅ hydrocarbon stream and a condensed lower aliphatic stream de ethanizing a portion of the lower aliphatic stream to recover gaseous offgas stream and a C₃ C₄ alkane product stream and recycling at least a portion of the condensed aliphatic stream from the debutanizing step for dilution of the olefinic feedstream. An apparatus arrangement for conduct ing such an improved process is also disclosed.
