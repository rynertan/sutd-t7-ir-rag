# Process relating to triglyceride oils.

## Abstract
The present process for removing impurities from a trig lyceride oil includes admixing a hydrolysed phosphatide and water with the oil, separating the oil into an oil portion and a sludge portion and separating the sludge portion into an aqueous phase and an oil phase. The presence of the hydrol ysed phosphatides can aid the two separation steps. Recovery of oil from the sludge is thus possible.
