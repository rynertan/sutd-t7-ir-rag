# THERMOPLASTIC MOLDING COMPOSITION, EPOXIDE VINYL ESTER RESIN COMPOSITION AND METHOD FOR MAKING SAME

## Abstract
Epoxide vinyl ester resins having significant amounts of epoxide and ethylenically unsaturated groups may be thick ened by reaction thereof with polyfunctional amines. The resulting resinous products, when molded at elevated temp eratures, exhibit increased viscosity and controlled flow.
