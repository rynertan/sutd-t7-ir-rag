# Position indicator employing light guides.

## Abstract
An apparatus for indicating the position of a movable member, such as a manual control lever 14 , which uses light signals. The apparatus includes at least three light guides 22, 24, 26 and means for introducing distinctively different, cycli cally varying light signals into at least two of the light guides. The degree of optical coupling between the third light 26 guide and each of the other two light guides 22, 24 is control led in accordance with the position of the movable member 14 . An indication of the position of the member 14 is then provided by detecting the third light signal and indicating the extent to which it exhibits the distinctive characteristics of the first and second light signals.
