# Supporting assembly.

## Abstract
A supporting assembly comprises a base member 10 having a spherical depression 12 and a supporting platform 22 having a hemispherical projection 20 . The projection is mounted in the depression and a pillar 24 projects through the two members, the pillar being rotatable in the base member and extending through a slot 28 in the hemispher ical projection 20 . The top 32 of the pillar is square in section and co operates with a channel 30 of similar width formed in the hemispherical projection having the same axis as the slot. The arrangement permits a VDU to pivot in one plane only relative to the pillar so that the edge of the screen remains parallel to a desk top and to swivel on the base member.
