## Description
COMPOS ITE PLASMID S This invention relates to a composite plasmid obtained from E. coli plasmid pCRl and an actinomyces S.lavendulae see, e.g. merck Index, 7th edition, page 982 plasmid pSLl. Plasmids are extranuclear genes and are widely used in the field of genetic engineering as vectors for in vitro genetic recombination. The in vitro genetic recombination technique has wide uses such as the growth of useful microorganisms, and the production of useful biologically active materials. Cloning in actinomyces would be useful for investigating antibiotic biosynthesis mechanisms and for obtaining new types of antibiotics, but a cloning system in actinomyces has not yet been established.One of the reasons for this is that suitable vectors with selective markers have not been available. The inventors previously succeeded in isolating plasmid pSLl from the actinomyces S. lavendulae see FEMS Microbiol Lett., 9, 111 113 1980 . The plasmid PSL1 is a potentially useful cloning vector since it has low molecular weight, multicopies, and only one cleavage site for restriction enzymes such as EcoRI, and SalI, etc. As the result of further investivations, the invention provides a family of new composite plasmids termed herein pMNl, psq2, pMNi1, and pMN2t said plasmids being formed by inserting an inomyces plasmid pSLl into kanamycinresistant plasmid pCRl obtained from E. coli. The invention provides a composite plasmid selected from plasmid pMNl having a molecular weight of 10.0 megadaltons, plasmid pMN2 having a molecular weight of 7.6 megadaltons, and plasmids pMNl and pMN2 having a molecular weight of 11.3 megadaltons, said composite plasmid being formed by inserting plasmid pSLl obtained from Streptomyces lavendulae into plasmid pCRl obtained from Escherichia coli and having a kanamycin resistant genetic marker and the following digestion characteristics to restriction enzymes i pMNl and pMN2 having one cleavage site to each of EcoRI and SalI, and ii pMNl and pMN2 having two cleavage sites to each of EcoRI and SalI. The composite plasmids pMN1, pMN2, p El , and pMN2 of this invention can provide a new method of molecular cloning and possess the following properties 1. The composite plasmids have kanamycin resistant genetic markers and hence transformant can be easily selected. 2. The composite plasmids retain the DNA structure of actinomyces plasmid pSLl. In particular, composite plasmid pMNl retains the greater part of the DNA structure of pSLl. 3. Composite plasmids pMNl and pMN2 have one cleavage site to restriction enzymes EcoRI and SalI. 4. The composite plasmids can effect DNA amplification in the presence of chloramphenicol. Since composite plasmids pMNl, pMN2, pMNl and pMN2 stem from the plasmid of E. coli and the plasmid of actinomyces as described above, the invention provides for a shuttle vector capability by subjection of composite plasmid pMNl, pMN2, pMNl or pMN2 to cloning in E. coli to amplify the gene in E. coli, return of the gene to the actinomyces, and subjection of the gene to genetic cloning in the actinomyces. The general procedures for the formation and isolation of composite plasmids pMNl, pMN2, pNNl and pMN2 of this invention may be as follows 1 Cleavage and recombination of plasmid DNA by restriction enzymesThe cleavage ofplasmid DNA with restriction enzymes EcoRI andSalI is performed at 370C according to the assay conditions set out in the directionsforuseoftherestriction enzymes. The cleavage fragments are mixed and precipitated with cold ethanol.The precipitates are centrifuged, dried in vacuo, and dissolved in a ligation mixture 66 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.6, 6.6 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.4 mM ATP . Then, T4 ligase is added to the mixture and the resultant mixture is incubated at 120C for 40 hours. The mixture is reprecipitated with cold ethanol and the precipitates are resuspended in TEN buffer 10 mM Tris HCl, 50 mz NaCl, and l..mN EDTA, pH 7.6 . 2 Transformation of E. coli The transformation is performed according to the method described in Norgard et al Gere , 3, 279 292 1978 . 3 Colony hydridization. Colony hybridization is performed by a modification of the hybrid formation method described in Grustein and Hogness Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA , 72, 3961 3965 1975 .The kanamycin resistant transformant of E. coli is transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter placed on an agar plate containing kanamycin 50 g ml the filterbeing washed twice with boilling water and treated in an autoclave for 10 ninutes before being placed on the agar plate . Then the filter is transferred onto the same agar plate containing chloramphenicol 170 g ml and further incubated overnight at 370C. The filter is withdrawn from the agar plate and placed on Whatman 3MN papers presoaked with 0.5 M NaOH for 7 minutes to. effect lysis and DNA denaturation.The filter is washed with 1 M Tris HCl of pH 7.4 for 2 minutes and then 0.5 N Tris HCl l.5 II NaCl of pH 7.4 for 4 minutes and dried. After further washing with chloroform and then 0.3 I4 NaCl, the filter is treated in a vacuum oven at 800C for 2 hours. The hybrid forming treatment is performed with a filter in a hybrid forming buffer 50 formamide 6 X SSC, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 0.02 polyvinyl pyrrolidone, 0.02 bovine serum albumin, 0.02 Ficoll, 0.5 sodium lauryl sulfate, and 20 g ml of denatured salmon sperm DNA containing 32P labeled pSL1 DNA Rigby s. Therea ter, Biol. 98, 503 517 1977 at 520C for 36 hours. Thereafter, the filter is washed and autoradiographed for 16 hours at 70 C. Transformants h of composite plasmid enamycn resistance the composite plasmid are first selected by kanamycin resistance coded by pCRl and then selected by the colony hybridization technique using labelledpSLl. The presence of composite plasmid of pCR1 and pSL1 in the clones hybridized with labeled pSLl can thus be distinguished 5 Isolation of composite plasmid. The isolation of the composite plasmid is performed by the microscale technique described in Klein, Selsing, and Wells Plasmid 3, 88 91 1980 . This microscale technique involves cell lysis with phenol, centrifugation, phenol extraction, ethanol precipitation, RNase digestion, etc., and is suitable for isolating the composite plasmid for restriction enzyme analysis. There are two kinds of composite plasmid pIENl Type I and pMN2Ãš Type II , according to the different configurations of the pSLl combination, and these configurations can be differentiated by the digestion pattern of plasmid DNA with EcoRI. The configurations shown in the foregoing schematic programme of the construction of composite plasmid are evident from the fact that in the case of Type I cleavage with EcoRI gives two fragments of 10 d megadalton and 1.3 Nd and that in the case of TypeII the cleavage gives two fragments of 7.6 Md and 3.7 Md. 6 Isolation of composite plasmids pNNl and pMN2. The composite plasmids of Type I and Type II each has two cleavage sites by EcoRI and SalI and each of the cleavage sites of EcoRI and SalI can be deleted individually by the following operation The composite plasmids of Type I and Type II are cleaved by the restriction enzyme EcaRR and subjected to agarose electrophoresis. The resulting high molecular weight fragment the 10 Md fragment in the case of Type I and the 7.6 d fragment in the case of Type II is extracted from the gel and ligated with T4 ligase. E. coli 600 is infected with the gated mixture, kanamycin resistant clones are selected, and the DNA plasmids pMN1 and pMN2 are isolated from the transformants.The isolated plasmids pl and pMN2 have the following properties i Molecular weight pNNl 10.0 Md pMN2 7.6 Md. ii One cleavage site to EcoRI and SalI. iii Double digestion by different restriction enzymes of EcoRI and SalI. Thus a Plasmid pMNI gives two fragments of 7.5 Md and 2.5 Md the former corresponds to the EcoRI and SalI cleavage fragment of pCRI, and the latter corresponds to the cleavage fragment of pSLl. b Plasmid pMN2 gives two fragments of 7.5 Md and 0.1 Md Their assignment is as in a . iv The fragment digestedby EccRI does not contain kanamycin resistant genes that is, plasmids pMNl and pMN2 contain kanamycin resistant genes . The invention will be further explained by the following Example. Plamid pSLl used in the Example is the plasmid prepared by the method described in FEMS. Microbiol. Lett. 9, 111 113 1980 and plasmid pCRI is a known one see Molecular and General Genetics, 145, 155 156 1976 .The host E. coli C600 see Gene , Jan.1980, p. 138 , the restriction enzymes EcoRI and SalI , and the ligase T4 ligase used in the Example are all known and commercially available EXAMPLE 1 Restriction and recombination of pCRl and pSLl The plasmids pCRl 0.4 pg and pSLl 0.2 g , purified by subjection twice to caesium chloride ethidium bromide density gradient centrifugation, were completely digested with restriction enzyme SalI made by Takara ShuzoK.K. .The reaction was stopped by heating to 650C for 10 minutes after adding 2 3 times by volume of cold ethanol 20 C to the reaction mixture, the mixture was allowed to stand for 15 minutes at 700C, and the precipitates thus .formed were recovered by centrifugation for 20 minutes at 16,000 r. p. m. After suspending the precipitates in 150 l of a ligase reaction mixture 66 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.6, 6.6 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothritol, and 0.4 m ATP , T4 ligase was added thereto and the mixture was reacted for 40 hours at 12 C. The reaction mixture was. precipitated again with cold ethanol and DNA was resuspended in 200 l of TEN buffer 10 mM Tris HCl, 50 mM Nail, and 1MM EDTA, pH 7.6 . The DNA solution after the ligase reaction was subjected to a 0.7 agarose gel electrophoresis and after dyeing with ethidium bromide 1 g ml , the portion having a mobility lower than that of pCR1 linear DNA was cut by means of a razor blade under ultraviolet light of 350 n. m. and injected into 2 ml of a TEN buffer by means of an injector. After allowing to stand overnight at 40C, the mixture was frozen at 70 C for 2 hours and after fusing and then centri fuging the mixture for 30 minutes at 30,000 x g, the supernatant was filtered by means of a micropore filter HAWP .After extracting remaining ethidium bromide with isoamyl alcohol, the residue was dialyzed against 0.1 x SSC 15 mM NaCl and 1.5 mM sodium citrate l m EDTA pH 7.5 . 2 Trasformation of E. coli E. coli C600 thi thr leu lac r m was innoculated into 10 ml of Penassay broth Difco and after shaking cultivation overnight at 37 C, 0.1 ml of a seed culture was added to 10 of the same culture mediun. After further incubtion for 2.5 hours, cells were collected and washed twice with 0.1 M NaCl 5 mM MgCl 5 mM Tris HCl pH 7.6 . The washed cells were suspended in 4 ml of 100 mM CaCl2 250 mM KC1 5 mM MgCI2 5 m Tris HCl pH 7.6 and after allowing to stand for 25 minutes at 0 C, the suspension was centrifuged again.The cells thus recovered were resuspended in 0.6 ml of buffer having the same composition as above and after adding thereto 400 g1 of DNA extracted previously from an agarose gel, the mixture was allowed to stand for 60 minutes at 0 C. Then, after treating the mixture for 2 minutes at 42 C, the mixture was added to 10 ml of Penassay broth, and after shaking cultivation for one hour at 37 C the cultured product was seeded onto an agar culture medium incorporating 50 g ml of kanamycin. 3 Colony hybridization A Schleicher Schull nitrocellulose filter 13 x 9.5 cm was washed twice in boiling water, inserted between Whatman 3MM papers, and subjected to autoclave sterilization for 10 minutes.After drying, the filter was superposed on an agar culture medium incorporating 50 g ml of kanamycin and the kanamycinresistant strain having pCRl isolated in foregoing step 2 was replicated by means of a toothpick. After cultvating overnight at 37 C, the filter having bacteria or cells was transferred onto an agar culture medium incorporating 50 g ml of kanamycin and 170 g ml of chloramphenicol and the cells were further cultured overnight. at 370C to amplify plasmids. Four 3MM papers previously impregnated with 0.5 N NaOH were laminated and the nitrocellulose filter was placed thereon with he cell carrying surface at the upper side ar. treated for 7 minutes. Similarly, the filter was treated twice with 1 M Tris HCl pH 7.4 for 2 minutes and further with 1.5 N NaCl 0.5 M TrisHCl pH 7.4 for 4 minutes. After washing the filter with chloroform and then 0.3 M NaCl, the filter was dried and kept in vacuo for 2 hours at 80 C. The filter was used for hybridization. Plasmid pSL 1 labeled with 32P was prepared as follows.After heating 24 l of a reaction mixture containing 7 11 of alpha 32P dATP 10 mCi ml , 2.5 l of 10 x buffer 500 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.8, 50 mM MgCl2, 100 mM mercaptoethanol, and 1 mg ml glatin , 5 l of 25 M dTTP, dGTP, dCTP, 8.5 l of pSL1 DNA, and l Ll of DNase 50 g ml for 15 minutes at 370C, 1 l ofDNA polymerase was added thereto and they were cultured for 2 hours at 15 C. To the culture medium were added 57 l of 30 mMTris HCl pH 8.0 10 mM EDTA and 104 1 of 2 mg ml tRNA and then proteins were denatured and removed with the same volume of chloroform isoamyl alcohol 24 1 .To the aqueous layer formed was added 10v11 of 1.5 M sodium acetate solution, DNA was precipitated with 300 l of cold ethanol, and after centrifuging, the precipitates thus recovered were dissolved in 100 l of 10 mMTris HCl pH 8.0 1 mM EDTA. By this method, about 5 x 10 cpm of 32P count was recovered in The DNA fraction. To the DNA solution were added 36s41 of 10 mg ml salmon Sperm DNA and 0.5 ml of water and the mixture was denatured for 5 minutes at 1000 C and chilled, and used as the probe for the hybridization. The nitroceliulose filter adsorbed with DNA was prehybridized for 4 hours at 520C with 6 x SSC 0.02 PVP polyvinylpyrrolidone 0.02 BSA albumin 0.02 Ficoll, and 20 g ml tRNA 50 formamide.After pre hybridization, 200 Fl of a solution of labelled pSLl was added to 10 ml of a hybridization buffer 6 x SSC, 0,02 PVPBSA Ficoll, 0.5 formamide, and 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate , the filter was placed in the buffer and they were allowed to stand for 36 hours at 52 C in a sealed plastics bag. After washing the filter with 6 x SSC, 0.02 PVP BSA Ficoll, the filter was treated with the same solution for one hour at 52 C the same operation was repeated with 6 x SSC, the filter was finally washed twice with 2 x SSC and after heating to 520C for 30 minutes, the filter was dried. The filter was then wrapped, brought into close contact with a Fuji X ray film, and mounted in a cassette with a Du Pont intensifying screen and allowed to stand for 16 hours at 700C. After development, 3 strains of strongly blackened clones were obtained. They were considered to have pSLl. 4 Confirmation of direction of combination of hybrid plasmid pMN1 or pMN2 of pCRl and pSLl Plasmid was isolated from the foregoing three str.ains which ere considered to have the hybrid plasmid pNNl or pMN2 of pCR1 and pSLl and the direction of the combination of pCRl and pSLl was determined. After cultivating ov.ernight the 3 strains in Penassay broth at 370C, 1 ml of the cultured solution was transferred to 10 ml of the same culture medium and shaking cultivation was performed again for 1.5 hours. Then, chloramphenicol was added to 170 g ml and after cultivating for 8 hours, the cells were collected. The W8cellia were suspended in 0.5 ml of 50 mMTris HCl pH 8 , the suspension was placed in an tppendorf tube and after adding thereto 0.05 ml of 10 ng ml lysozyme, the mixture was allowed to stand for 15 minutes.at room temperature to perform lysis.Then, 0.5 ml of phenol previously saturated with 50 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0 was added to the suspension and mixed by thrice turning over the tube. After centrifuging for 5 minutes at 6,000 r. p. m., 0.3 ml of phenol was added again to the aqueous layer and after shaking vigorously, the aqueous layer was recovered and the extraction of phenol was performed 2 3 times with 1.4 ml of chloroform. DNA was precipitated with 2 times by volume of cold ethanol and the precipitates were suspended in 100 l of water, to give a sample of pIasmid DNA. Restriction enzyme treatment was performed at 37 0C by adding restriction enzyme and 10 l of 1 mg ml RNase A the solution was previously heated to 900C for 10 minutes to inactivate DNase existing in the mixture to 10 LI of the sample. From the result of 0.7 agarose electrophoresis, it was shown that the plasmid of three kinds of strains had pCRl and pSLl combined in the direction shown in the above described schematic programme, that is, was pMN1 Type I . 5 Preparation of pMN1 One of two EcoRI and SalI sites of the hybrid plasmid confirmed in step 4 was deleted as follows. digesting After completely 120 l of the hydrid plasmid pMN1 with EcoRI, the digested plasmid was subjected to 0.7 agarose gel electrophoresis, and dyed with ethidium bromide. Thereafter, one of two bands thus obtained and havingthelower mobility was cut by a razor blade and DNA was extracted in the mannerdescribed before. The extracted DNA was precipitated with cold ethanol and after dissolving the precipitates in 200 awl of a ligation buffer, 1 l of T4 ligase was added thereto and reacted for 40 hours at 120C. E. coli C600 was transformed with the ligase reaction mixture by the method previously described to isolate the kanamycin resistant strain. The plasmid DNA of the kanamycin resistant strain was determined by restriction enzyme treatment, etc., and was named p 4Nl.
