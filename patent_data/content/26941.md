# Chromium modified silicon tin containing copper base alloys, process of treating same and uses of same.

## Abstract
A copper base alloy and process of treating same. The alloy consists essentially of about 1.0 to 4.5 silicon about 1.0 to 5.0 tin about 0.01 to 0.45 chromium and the balance essentially copper. Preferably, the chromium level is less than about 0.12 in order to provide good tool wear characteristics. Workpieces are formed from this alloy by a process comprising hot working said alloy from a starting tempera ture in excess of 650 C upto within 20 C of the solidus temperature, the temperature at the end of this working step exceeding 400 C cold working and annealing at a temperature between 450 and 600 C during ¹ ₂ to 8 hours.
