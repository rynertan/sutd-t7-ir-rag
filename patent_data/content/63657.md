# Topical application of interferon inducers.

## Abstract
Virus infections of eye, skin and mucous membrane tissue are effectively treated by controlled release topical application of interferon inducers. The inducers are included in pharmaceutical compositions with a controlled release agent such as a pharmaceutically acceptable water soluble polymer that is solid at body temperature, e.g. a cellulose ether.

## Description
TOPICAL APPLICATION OF INTERFERON INDUCERS This invention is concerned with the prevention and treatment of virus infections of eye, skin and mucous membrane tissue by the controlled release topica application of interferon inducer S. Interferon is a class of soluble proteins that inhibit virus multiplication. They are produced by cells in response to virus infection and are not virus specific in their inhibitory actions. The cellular production of interferon also can be induced by certain materials other than viruses such as double stranded synthetic polynucleotide complexes dsRNA as reported byField et al., oc. Nat. Ac. Sci., 58, 1004 1010 1967 , and U.S. Patent 4,124,702, especially polyriboinosinic acid polyribocytidylic acid.This material is otherwise known as poly I poly C, poly I C, poly rI poly rC, cr rIn rCn and is herein after referred to as poly I C. Furthermore, dsRNA such as poly I C have been successfully used to induce resistance against systemic as well as localized infections. Topical application of drags, including interferon inducers, often requires frequent repeated treatments in order to ensure adequate drug exposure of the infected tissue. This limitation has been a serious problem, especially for potential application of antiviral drugs to mucous membranes and the cornea and conjunctiva of the eye. The present invention is based on the unexpected discovery that controlled release topical application of interferon inducers is very effective in the local topical treatment of virus infections of the eye, skin and mucous membrane tiSsueS and in accordance with the present invention an interferon inducer is incorporated in a controlled release means for effecting such treatment. The present invention also provides a controlled release formulation for topical application to the skin, eye or mucous membrane tissue comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable watersoluble polymer that is solid at body temperature and in which is incorporated, in a homogeneous manner, a therapeutically effective antiviral amount of an interferon inducer. Treating virus infections of the eye, skin and mucous membrane tissue by topical application of an interferon inducer using a controlled release means can provide an optimum amount of interferon inducer at the site of the infection for a prolonged period of time. Interferon inducers useful in the novel method of treatment of this invention are double stranded synthetic poly nucleotide complexes such as poly I C and poly A U natural double stranded RNA derived from virus infected bacterial cells, such as MU9 daRNA or daRNA isolated from Penicillium species and non polynucleotide inducers such ac Tilorone hydrochloride and 1,3 dimethyl 4 5 dimetllWlamino propylamino lH pyrazo lo 3, 4 b quinoline dihydrochloride. The controlled release of an interferon inducer is accomplished by incorporating the interferon inducer, in a homogeneous manner, into a matrix consisting of a water soluble polymer that is solid at or near body temperature. The watersoluble polymer may be a cellulose ether such as methyl cellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, hydrozypropylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, or sodium carboxymethylcellulose, or other pharmaceutically acceptable polymer such as polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, carboxyvinylpolymer or polyethylene glycol.The preferred water soluble polymer is hydroxypropylcellulose.Amounts of 0.0025 to 0.4 mg of interferon inducer per 1 mg of formulation are appropriate, preferably 0.075 to 0.25 mg of interferon inducer per 1 mg of formulation. For treatment of virus infections of the skin, such as by the Herpes group of viruses, it is convenient to employ the novel formulation of this invention in the form of a sheet with a thickness of about 0.25 to about 3.0 mm, preferably about 1 mm with an area approximating the area to be treated and held in place by bandaging materials. An alternate means of accomplishing the novel controlled release application of this invention on the skin is by use of a specially designed bandage for the purpose, such as disclosed inU.S. Patents 3,734,097 and 3,797,494, and U.S.Application Serial No. 960,354, filed November 13, 1978 by Harwood. For treatment of virus infections of the eye, rectangular or rod shaped pieces of the formulation of about 2.5 12 mg may be inserted between the eye and the lower eyelid. For use as vaginal inserts or rectal suppositories, the controlled release formulations of this invention are in the usual sizes and shapes and contain between about 2.5 250 mg of interferon inducer per 1 g of formulation. The following Examples describe two experiments comparing the beneficial effect of the novel method of treatment of this invention in the eye, with certain control treatments, and a typical ophthalmic insert formulation. From the results it is concluded that rabbit eye treatment using a poly I C insert was effective in preventing or substantially delaying and reducing the Herpes virus infection, as measured by reduction of virus production. This protective effect was the result of effective controlled delivery of the interferon inducer, poly I C. Treat ment of animals with either placebo inserts or poly I C in PBS did not effectively alter virus infection. EXAMPLE 1 New Zealand white rabbits were infected with Herpes simplex virus Type 1 HSV 1 by dropping 0.05 ml containing approximately 10 infectious doses onto the cornea of each eye. Animals were treated 2 animals per group, four eyes total with 1 200 rg of poly I C in 0.1 ml of phosphate buffered saline PBS 2 0.1 ml of phosphate buffered saline or 3 eye inserts each containing 400 pg of poly I C. The first treatment occurred 6 hours prior to infection and continued once daily for 4 days.Prior to treatment each day, each eye was swabbed to recover infectious virus, and the HSV 1 titer was determined in each case and the results are recorded in Table I.
