# DIESEL ENGINE WITH OIL CUSHIONED PISTON

## Abstract
The hydraulic elastic element 3, 6, 7 between the piston 22 and the small end of connecting rod 10 of the diesel engine acts as a spring owing to the compressibility of oil, and by the action of this element the cylinder volume of the engine can be automatically controlled according to the change of pressure of gas in the cylinder. This property enables the engine to take a higher compression ratio on the condition that the maximum pressure of gas in the cylinder remains within its predetermined limit, and to raise the compression ratio automatically when the load of the engine drops, with the result that the efficiency of the engine will be increased and the performance of the engine under low load will be improved. The rigidity of the above mentioned hydraulic elastic element can be easily adjusted with the engine in operation for further improvement of the perform ances of the engine under various loads.
