## Abstract
A device for applying a paper sheet to a water closet seat includes a paper sheet container 2 adapted to move between a substantially vertical position and a substantially horizontal position over the closet seat by manually operating a tilting mechanism 4a, 5a, 4b, 5b to which said container 2 is pivotally secured. A rotatable roller 17 is journalled within the container and is driven to feed a paper sheet through an opening in the container into position on the closet seat as the container moves either to the horizontal or the vertical position. Further the device includes a pressing means 16, 18, 21 to press part of the paper sheets on the paper driving roller 17 .
