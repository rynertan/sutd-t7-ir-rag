# Closing arrangement for packing containers.

## Abstract
A closing arrangement for packing containers, e.g. bottles for beer or refreshing beverages, comprises a substantially conventional cap body of flexible plastic mate rial, provided with locking devices in the form of integrated lever arms, which can be manoeuvred by means of a ring surrounding the cap body. The locking devices in closed position rest against a bulge located around the neck of the bottle and can be manoeuvred with the help of the ring to an open position in which they permit the unhindered removal or replacement of the cap.
