# Process for separating ethylene oxide and dichlorodifluoromethane from a mixture containing air in addition thereto.

## Abstract
The invention deals with a process for separating ethylene oxide and dichlorodifluoromethane from a mixture containing air in addition thereto. According to the invention the process comprises a first step consisting in contacting the gaseous air containing mix ture 2 into an absorption zone 3 with a counter current 6 of an organic liquid solvent and a second step consisting in passing the bottoms 8 of the first step into a desorption zone 9 for recovering a gaseous overhead 10 of ethylene oxide and dichlorodifluoromethane and liquid bottoms 16 of the said solvent, the two zones 3 and 9 being connected in series in a closed system and submitted each to specific pressure and temperature conditions. This process is especially suitable for recovering ethy lene oxide and dichlorodifluoromethane in industrial steril izer using this gas as a sterilization gas.
