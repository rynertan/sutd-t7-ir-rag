## Description
NO OVERLAY DECORATIVE LAMINATES BACKGROUND This invention generally relates to decorative laminates and methods of producing the same. More particularly, this invention relates to high wear, no overlay decorative laminates employing a fully hydrolyzed polyvinyl alcohol modified melamine formaldehyde resin coating in place of an overlay sheet. Conventionally, decorative laminates are made of three essential layers a core layer, a print layer, and a surface layer, The core layer constitutes a bottom or supporting layer onto which the other layers are bonded. In normal high pressure laminate manufacture the core layer consists of a plurality of cellulosic sheets. The core sheets are generally made from a kraft paper impregnated with a laminating resin. Laminating resins commonly used for the core layer include phenolic, amino, epoxy, polyester, silicone, and diallyl phthalate resins to nave but a few. The industrially preferred laminating resin for decorative laminates appears to be a phenolic resin made from the reaction of phenols with formaldehyde.In low pressure laminate manufacture the core layer is generally comprised of a sheet of particleboard ranging from 3 8 to 1 in thickness. Placed above the core layer is the print layer which is generally an alpha cellulose pigmented paper containing a print, pattern, or design t hat.has been impregnated with a melamine formaldehyde resin. Typically, the printing is performed prior to impregnation by a high speed rotogravure. The cured melamine formaldehyde resins are colorless and resistant to light they are resistant to a variety of solvents and stains and their heat resistance makes them immune to burning cigarettes, boiling water and heated containers up to about 325 F. Without these melamine formaldehyde resins the decorative laminate industry would not exist as it is known today. However, because these resins are extremely brittle, they sometimes require. reinforcement. The surface layer, or overlay as it is commonly referred to, is a bjh quaiity alpha cellulose paper im.preg nated with a melamine formaldehyde resin. This layer protects the print sheet from external abuse such as abrasive wear and tear, harsh chemicals, burns, spills and the like. It is primarily the melamine formaldehyde resin which accounts, for these protective properties. The alpha cellulose paper acts as a translucent carrier for water thin resin, imparts strength to the rather brittle melamine formaldehyde resin, maintains a uniform resin thickness in the overlay by acting as a shim, and controls resin flow. The core layer, print layer and surface layer are stacked in a superimposed relationship, usually between polished steel plates, and subjected to a pressure and temperature for a time sufficiently long enough to cure the laminating resins impregnating the respective layers. The elevated temperatures and pressure actually cause the impregnated resins within the sheets to flow which consolidates the whole into an integral mass, known as the laminate. These laminates find use as counter tops, table tops, furniture, store fixtures and the like. Employment of the overlay sheet has, however, generated a host of unwanted problems. The overlay contributes substantial material cost.to the manufactured laminate. Not only are there raw material costs involved, such as expensive high quality alpha cellulose paper and melamine formaldehyde resins, but there exists substantial processing costs, such as collating sheets, scrap losses generated by the brittle and difficult to handle impregnated sheets, as well as the cost of impregnation itself. In addition to these unwanted expenditures and processing steps, the translucent character of the overlay sheet becomes visually disturbing in decorative laminates when, through the use of more advanced printing techniques, a sharper, more intricate design is employed. Thus, there exists the need for substitution of the overlay sheet by a tough and transparent thermoset layer that will eliminate haze or blur, incur fewer processing steps and lower costs, and yet maintain sufficient resistance to external abuse to be commercially acceptable. The provision for such a layer would fulfill a long felt need and constitute a significant advance in the art. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides for a fully hydrolyzed polyvinyl alcohol PVA modified melamine formaldehyde resin coating to be employed as a substitute for the conventional overlay sheet as the, protective surface layer in laminates. The application of this modified thermosetting resin allows for the elimination of the overlay sheet thereby providing substantial processing and cost savings in the manufacture of laminates. In addition, the requirements of the National Electrical Manufacturers Association hereinafter referred to as NEMA for high pressure decorative laminates are still satisfied when this resin is employed. Finally, the transparent nature of this resin provides for a clear and undistorted appearance of the print, pattern or design in the decorative laminate. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention there is provided a heat and pressure consolidated laminate consisting essentially of, in superimposed relationship, a core layer comprised of a self supporting substrate, a print layer consisting of an opaque alpha cellulose paper sheet, and a surface coating of a fully hydrolyzed polyvinyl alcohol PVA modified melamine formaldehyde resin wherein the surface coating weight is from about 60 to about 140 grams per square meter and the amount of fully hydrolyzed PVA in the surface coating is from about 5 to about 30 percent by weight of the total weight of the melamine formaldehyde reaction product solids. The fully hydrolyzed polyvinyl alcohol modified melamine ormaldehydc resin employed as the surface coating in the laminates of the present invention comprises the reaction product of melamine, formaldehyde and fully hydrolyzed pol vinvl alcohol wherein the molar ratio of melamine to nrmaldehE is abOzzt 1 1 to about 1 3, respectively, and the fully hydrolyzed polyvinyl alcohol comprises from about 5 to about 30 percent by weight of the total weight of the melamine formaldehyde reaction product solids. The heat and pressure consolidated laminate of then present invention is produced according to the method which comprises positioning the consolidated laminate assembly between press plates, applying sufficient temperature and pressure to the laminate assembly to cure tile resins impregnating the laminate assembly, thereby providing the decora tive.laminate, and recovering the resultant laminate. The core layer of the laminate may, for example, contain either a plurality of sheets impregnated with a laminating resin or a commercially available pressed particleboard. In high pressure lamina,tes, the core layer is typically provided by a plurality of impregnated sheets. These sheets can be varied in their nature in accordance with the particular properties desired in the decorative laminate.Typically, the core layer is made from paper, woven fabrics, mats, felts, or the like. Paper is by far the most widely used and thus constitutes the preferred stock for the core layer in high pressure laminate. More particularly, a kraft paper of about a 60 to about a 130 pound basis weight per 3000 square foot ream is preferred as the stock from which the core layer sheets are prepared for high pressure laminates because of its strong, cheap and plentiful nature. In lowpressure laminates, a particleboard of from about 3 8 to about 1 inch in thickness is preferred as the self supporting substrate comprising the core layer. Suitable particleboards are commercially available in plentiful quantities at moderate cost. The laminating resins used for impregnating the sheets of the core layer can be any of those thermosetting resins conventionally used in the production of laminates.Laminating resins conventionally used include, but are not limited to, phenolic, .amino, epoxy, polyester, silicone and diallyl phthalate resins. The most commonyl employed laminating resin and that preferred in the instant invention, is the condensation product of a phenol and an aldehyde, generally referred to as a phenolic resin. In particular, it is preferable to employ an alkaline catalyzed phenol formaldehyde condensation product as the laminating resin employed in the core layer. These resins can be purchased commercially or prepared according to conventional proce durex The alpha cellulose sheet used in the print layer of wÀe la slinate generally runs from about 50 to about 120 pound basis weight per 3000 square foot ream.Upon this alpha cellulose sheet is displayed a print, pattern or design suitable for the intended use of the laminate. The decorative print, pattern or design is typically applied by a high speed rotogravure before the sheet is impregnated with the melamine formaldehyde resin. Recently, photogravure reproductions of natural materials such as wood, marble and leather have been applied to these alpha cellulose Sheets as well.Typically, a three ink system is employed with the alpha cellulose sheet itself being highly pigmented to provide a fourth color as background and as an opaque base by which the core layer is accordingly obscured. Although printing can be accomplished at any time prior to impregnation of the melamine formaldehyde resin, printing is often done immediately before the impregnation. Printing houses make available, for those laminators not equioped with printing equipment, already printed alpha cellulose paper of various prints, patterns, or designs. In some applications, abrasive materials have been employed in the overlay in order to improve abrasion resistance. There the abrasive materials are generally deposited upon the alpha cellulose matrix or, in other applications, mixed with cellulosic fibers or microcrystalline materials replacing the alpha cellulose sheet. Incorporation of these abrasive materials into the overlay often results in severe damage to the delicate, highly polished or intricately etched surfaces of the press plates when the abrasive particles deposited in the overlay come into contact therewith. To avoid these unwanted problems, the finely divided abrasive materials which lend to the laminate increased abrasion resistance may be incorporated into the alpha cellar lose sheet of the present invention in various methods. For example, the abrasive material may be added in the pulper or in the head box during the paper making process. This method causes uniform distribution of the abrasive particles throughout the sheet, the individual sheet fibers holding the particles through the formation of a matrix network around each particle. Additionally, the abrasive material may be added to the impregnating thermosetting resin. In this latter approach, a thin layer of abrasive particles is deposited on the surface of the opaque alpha cellulose paper during impregnation. In both instances, the abrasive materials become an integral part of the print layer. Suitable abrasive materials should be clear, highly translucent materials with a refractive index which is substantially identical to that of the thermosetting resin.Such materials include, but are not limited to, silica, silicates, glass fibers, clear asbestos, quartz, corundum, alumina, and other suitable natural or synthetic abrasive materials. Preferably, finely divided silica having particles ranging in size up to 40 microns with an average size of approximately 5 to 10 microns are employed. The abrasive material added constitutes approximately 10 to 20 percent by weight of the impregnating melamine formaldehyde thermosetting resin, preferably about 15 percent by weight of said resin. Suitable melamine formaldehyde resins for impregnation of the print layer are prepared by reacting melamine with formaldehyde in an aqueous dispersion or solution.The mole ratio of the melamine to formaldehyde may be varied from about 1 1 to about 1 3, respectively. It is preferred that the mole ratio be controlled from about 1 1.3 to about 1 2, melamine to formaldehyde, respectively. The reaction occurs under alkaline conditions at a temperature ranging from about 700 to the reflux temperature until a clear reaction product is obtained. The fully hydrolyzed PVA modified melamine formaldehyde resin used as a coating over the print layer not only obviates the need for an overlay sheet but provides a high wear, clear, craze free decorative laminate that is aesthetically more pleasing. The polyvinyl alcohol is employed as a plasticizer with considerable ductility whose particles in the brittle matrix of the melamine formaldehyde resin provide for a toughening of the thus modified resin.The substantially one hundred percent or fully hydrolyzedPVA is required over the partially hydrolyzed PVA for use in the melamine formaldehyde resin because the partially hydrolyzed PVA modified melamine formaldehyde has exhibited too short of a shelf like time elapse before gelation for practical purposes, even when stabilizers such as o,p toluene sulfonamide h.ave been added. Fully hydrolyzed PVA is commercially availabe for use in the present invention. The fully hydrolyzed PVA employed in the coating layer generally will not be prepared by hydrolysis of polyvinyl alcohols. Instead, the fully hydrolyzed PVA is the product of fully hydrolyzing a polyvinyl ester, such as polyvinyl acetate or polyvinyl formate. This procedure is more efficient and less costly. However, the term fully hydrolyzed PVA is generally recognized in the trade to apply to the fully hydrolyzed polyvinyl ester, and as such will continue to be applied herein. In preparing the fully hydrolyzed PVA modified melamine formaldehyde resin of the present invention, the first stage in the preparation of this coating is the reaction between melamine and formaldehyde. Although the fully hydrolyzed PVA may be added after the reaction of the melamine and formaldehyde forms a clear resin product, it is preferable to add the fully hydrolyzed PVA to the initial stage. The mole ratio of melamine to formaldehyde can be varied from about 1 1 to about 1 3, respectively. The reaction is to be carried out in an aqueous dispersion or solution. To facilitate this aqueous phase reaction, aqueous formaldehyde solutions commercially available are usually employed in the preparation of the modified resin. The reaction between melamine and formaldehyde should occur under alkaline conditions. The preferred pH range of the reaction is 7.5 to 10. For this purpose, a buffering material to control the pH is traditionally employed. One such buffering agent that may be advantageously used is triethanolamine, although the present invention is not limited to this particular buffering material. The buffering agent may be employed during the initial stages of the reaction, during both the initial stage and the modification stage, or not at all. During the initial stage of the melamine formal dehyde reaction, the reaction temperature is not critical although lower temperatures, such as room temperature, cause the reaction to progress rather slowly. At this point, the fully hydrolyzed PVA may be added to the reaction. The amount of fully hydrolyzed PVA to be employed may vary from about 5 to 30 on a weight basis of the total weight of the melamine formaldehyde reaction product solids. It is generally preferred, however, that the fully hydrolyzed PVA added be in an amount of from about 10 to 20 on a weight basis of the total weight of the melamine formaldehyde reaction product solids.It is likewise preferred that during the reaction between the fully hydrolyzed PVA and the melamine formaldehyde resin, a reaction temperature ranging from about 700C to the reflux temperature should be maintained, preferably about 800C to 900C. The reaction should continue until the percent water tolerance of the reaction ranges from about 300 to about 1000 in 50C water. The expression, percent water tolerance, is a well known term in the resin art and simply means that a sample of resin can be diluted in a certain percent of its volume without displaying any milkiness, i.e. 300 water tolerance at 50C indicates that the given sample can be diluted in three times its volume of 50C water without displaying any milkiness.After the reaction product has reached the desired endpoint, it is cooled to ambient temperature and stored for coating use. If the resin product is not viscous enough for coating purposes and penetrates the print paper during subsequent coating operations a small amount of a thickening agent, such as carboxyl methyl cellulose, sodium alginate or the like may be added with the other constituents during the reaction to correct this result. Additionally, stabilizers such as o,p toluene sulfonamide may be added to extend the shelf like of the resin coating. To further increase the resin viscosity, a small amount of a catalyst may be added before impregnation or coating operations. The catalyst should not be added earlier, however, because to do so adversely affects the shelf life of the modified resin so produced. The fully hydrolyzed PVA modified melamine formaldehyde resin is coated upon the print layer to a weight of from about 60 to about 140 grams per square meter, preferably about 70 to about 120 grams per square meter. The coating operation may be performed by a knife coater, reverse roll coater, or similar technique. The preferred coating process is the knife coater wherein the knife and resin dam are mounted on a roller, adjustment of the gap between the print sheet and the knife coater varies the coating thickness to its desired amount. The coating operation may be a separate operation or part of the impregnation operation.As a separate operation, the print sheet is first impregnated with a melamine formaldehyde resin and subsequently dried before the coating operation is commenced. As part of the impregnation operation coating is performed on the wet print sheet immediately subsequent to impregnation on a single apparatus. In the present invention a combination of these two methods is preferred wherein the entire impregnation and coating processes are performed on a single apparatus which is provided with the means to impart a partial drying to the wet print sheet subsequent to impregnation yet prior to coating, preferably by passing the impregnated print sheet through a hot air oven before the coating operation.After coating, the print sheet undergoes a terminal drying operation in which the coating print sheet is dried to a volatile content of from about 4 to about 9 , preferably about 6 . The terminal drying imparts upon the coated print sheet, the necessary flow characteristics for good bonding to take place in the subsequent heat pressing operation. In other applications a three dimensional textured or embossed laminate may be desirable. For these applications there is added to the fully hydrolyzed PVA modified melamine formaldehyde resin any one of, or a combination of, inorganic or organic color pigments, extender pigments, metallic pigments, etc. The amount of pigment added to the resin will vary from 0.5 to 20 , based on the total weight of the resin, and dependent upon the pigment used and resultant color contrast desired. Typical inorganic pigments useful include those iron pigments ranging in color from yellow through red, reddish brown, brown, brown to black, Such iron pigments include yellow ocher, raw and burnt sienna, and raw and burnt umber.Other useful inorganic color pigments include chrome yellow, cadmium sulfide, zinc yellow, cobalt blue, ultramarine blue, iron oxide, chrome green, chromium oxide green, chromium hydroxide green, lamp black, and white pigments such as titanium dioxide, titanium calcium, zinc oxide, zinc sulfide, antimony oxide, lithopone, etc. Although lead pigments may be used, they are preferably avoided because of the safety hazard involved in their use.Organic pigments which may be used include toluidine red, phthalocyanine blue and green, Vandyke brown, alizarin, madder lake, lithol red, and the like. Useful metallic pigments include aluminum powder, copper powder, bronze powders available in vario.us shades depending upon the alloy composition, zinc powder, gold and gold like powders, and the like. Any of the pigments, and particularly the metallic pigments, may be used alone or in combination with each other or in combination with other pigments. To this pigmented fully hydrolyzed PVA modified melamine formaldehyde resin is added varying amounts of thinners, solvents, fillers, etc. so as to vary its viscosities and thereby cause the pigmented material to flow more than the resin in the decor sheet during the consolidation procedure. The fully hydrolyzed PVA modified melamine formaldehyde resin is coated upon the print layer and the embossed laminate assembly to a weight of from about 0.5 to about 20 grams per square foot, preferably about 5 to about 10 grams per square foot. The coating operation may be performed by a knife coater, reverse roll coater, or similar technique. The preferred coating process is the knife coater wherein the knife and resin dam are mounted on a roller, adjustment of the gap between the print sheet and the knife coater varies the coating thickness to its desired amount. The coating operation may be a separate operation or part of the impregnation operation. As a separate operation, the print sheet is first impregnated with a melamine formaldehyde resin and subsequently dried before the coating operation is commenced. As part of the impregnation operation coating is performed on the wet print sheet immediately subsequent to impregnation on a single apparatus.In the present invention a combination of these two methods is preferred wherein the entire impregnation and coating processes are performed on a single apparatus which is provided with the means to impart a partial drying to the wet print sheet subsequent to impregnation yet prior to coasting, preferably by passing the impregnated print sheet through a hot air oven before the coating operation. After coating, the print sheet undergoes a terminal drying operation in which the coated print sheet is dried to a volatile content of from about 4 to about 9 , preferably about 6 . The terminal drying imparts upon the coated print sheet the necessary flow characteristics for good bonding to take place in the subsequent heat pressing operation. In yet other applications a docorative metallic laminate may be desired. In these applications, the print layer is no longer employed, rather, the fully hydrolyzedPVA modified melamine formaldehyde resin containing finely divided metallic powders is employed directly onto the core layer. After the fully hydrolyzed PVA modified melamine formaldehyde resin has been prepared according to this invention, finely divided metallic powders. or pigments are added to the resin. The metallic powder or pigments constitutes from about 2 to 8 percent by weight of the fully hydrolyzed PVA modified melamine formaldehyde resin, preferably about 5 percent by weight. The metallic particles employed range in size from about 25 to 75 microns. Suitable metals for this purpose include, but are not limited to, aluminum, copper, zinc, nickel, tin, etc., and combinations of the same. Suitable pigments include TiO2, lamp black, etc.Typically, these metallic powders or pigments are vigorously mixed with the modified resin until a uniform dispersion is achieved. The resin provides for a transparent, noncorrosive coating for the particles as well as a medium through which the metallic finish may easily be applied. A preferred process for manufacturing a high pressure laminate of the present invention is one in which 3 to 9 core sheets consisting of 6 20 mil, kraft paper have been impregnated with a 30 to 60 solution of phenol formaldehyde resin so that the final resin solids content of the core sheets is about 20 to about 40 of the total weight of the core.Typically, these core sheets are oven dried after impregnation for a period of about one to two minutes at temperatures ranging from 1400C to 1700C. The print layer, when employed, consisting of a 50 to 120 pound basis weight per 3,000 square foot ream alpha cellulose pigmented sheet optionally displaying a print, pattern, design, or color is impregnated with the melamine formaldehyde resin so that the final resin solids content of the print sheet is from about 10 to about 40 of the print sheet, then partially dried, coated on its print bearing side with a fully hydrolyzed PVA modified melamine formaldehyde resin and then terminally dried. When the print layer is not employed, the top most sheet of the core layer is so coated.The sheets are then stacked such that the print sheet is the top most sheet with its print bearing the coated side facing outward. The stacked sheets are placed between polished stainless steel plates upon which there is exerted a pressure of from about 800 to 1600 psi at temperatures from about 1200C to 1800C for approximately 20 minutes to effect the cure and thereby provide the high pressure laminate. When a three dimensional textured or embossed laminate is preferred, the stacked sheets are placed between embossing press plates. The embossing press plates used in the novel process of the instant invention can be prepared by etching or machining a design,on a metal plate. Alternatively, and more preferably, the plate can be prepared as disclosed inU.S. Patent No. 3,718,496, which patent is hereby incorporated by reference.Still further, the raised printed design technique, as taught by Grosheim in U.S. 3,373,068 will also work well as an embossing medium in the instant invention.There is exerted upon these plates a pressure of from 800 to 1600 psi at temperatures from about 1200C to 1800C for approximately 20 minutes to effect the cure embossment and thereby provide the high pressure laminate. The embossed areas of the resultant laminate, i.e. those formed from the protuberances of the embossing plate and forming the valleys of the final embossment in the finished laminate surface should preferably be at least .007 inch deep. Depths of less than .007 inch are possible but not preferred because the color contrast is not as evident. Laminates of muted color differentials can be produced using embossments of these lesser depths however. A preferred process for manufacturing a low pressure laminate of the present invention is one in which a pressed particleboard of from about 3 8 to about 1 inch has stacked above it, in a manner identical to that employed in the high pressure laminate, the print sheet. The print sheet, if employed, being identical to the one employed in the high pressure laminate. The stack is placed between press plates upon which there is exerted a pressure of from about 200 to about 600 psi at temperatures from 1200C to about 1800C for approximately 20 minutes to effect the cure and thereby provide the low pressure laminate. The release sheets used in the pressing of laminate of this invention, if necessary, are well known in the art and may be any non adherable paper or non adherable aluminum foil. The non adherable paper may be a parchment type of paper of which a plurality are available commercially. The non adherable metal foils, as well as the laminate of paper and the non adherable foils, are also commercially available. Also suitable for this purpose are papers coated, treated or impregnated with polypropylene or the polyfluorocarbons and the like. Films of polypropylene may also be used. Silicone oil treated papers may be used and are also commercially available. Papers coated with sodium alginate and other salts of alginic acid are also suitable for this purpose and are available commercially. When low pressure laminates are being formed, no release sheet at all is necessary if the press plate has a releasing surface thereon. The following specific examples illustrate certain aspects of the present invention and, more particularly, point out methods of evaluating the unique advantages the decorative laminate of the present invention provides.However, the examples are set forth for illustration only and are not to be construed as limitations on the present invention except as set forth in the appended claims.All parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified.
