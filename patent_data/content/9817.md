## Description
PROCESS FOR PREPARING HOMOGENEOUS COMPOSITIONS OF OLEFINIC POLYMERS IN THE FORM OF GRANULES AND OF VARIOUSADDITIVES This invention relates to compositions containing additiv es, obtained from polyolefins in the form of freeflowing particles flakes and to the process for preparing same. For preparing manufactured articles of polyolefins, pigmented, stabilized and generally containing compounds modifying the characteristics of the articles, the Applicant and others have suggested processes based on the admixture of the polyolefins in powder with the additives, and on the successive transformation into granules by extrusion in the molten state. The granulated products are then utilized for being transformed into textile fibres, films, fibrillated films, fibrils, spun bonded, by extrusion, and into plastic articles by extrusion, blow molding, coating, thermoforming molding, calendering, roto molding and the like. The processes based on the mixing of powdered polyolefins with additives and on the successive granulation involve complex technological operations, which are necessary when it is operated with very fine powders. The polyolefins, however, can be prepared also in the farm of granules, the so called flakes, according to what described by C.W. Hock in Polymer Sci., 4, 3055 1966 , and in several patents in the name of the Applicant and of others. Such polymeric products are obtained directly in polymerization processes in suspension and consist of particles having an average size larger than 150 microns. These polyolefinic flakes can be directly transformed into additive containing articles, after a simple mixing of the polyolefins with the additives, and excluding the granulation step, as this would cause non homogeneous distrib tions of the additives in the polyolefins and difficulties in the transformation operations. The Applicant has now found a process . which is the object of the present invention for preparing additional polyolefinic flakes, which consists in mixing the polyolefins in flakes with the additives, in the presence of a small amounts of a third component a coupling agent having the function of promoting a homogeneous distribution of the additives on the flakes surfaces, binding then to the latter and making possible a direct transformation into manufactured articles, without any granulation step. The coupling agents suited to the use according to this invention are selected from the class consisting of paraffinic compounds, having a linear or branched chain, either liquid or solid, containing 2 to 500 carbon atoms, in particular vaseline oil, paraffin waxes, oligomers of propylene and ethylene, low molecular weight polypropylenesand the like, which are employed either in the pure state or in solution in hydrocarbon solvents. It has been also found and this is another feature of the present invention that the paraffin compounds may contain one or more polar functional groups. In such case the affinity between the coupling agent and the functional groups of the additives improves. Paraffinic compounds containing polar groups particularly useful according to this invention are the ones comprised in the following general formula R X wherein X is a linear or branched alkyl radical, containing 12 to 30, preferably 12 to 18, carbon atoms,X may be a OH b COOH or corresponding salts of alkaline metals c NR R where R and R , either like or unlike each other, are hydrogen or alkyls having 1 to 12 carbon atoms d O CH CH O H, 0 CH CH CH 0 H where n 1 50 2 2 3 2 n preferably 4 20EMI4.1 where n and n , either like or unlike each other, are comprised between 0 and 50, at least one being diffe rent from 0 f OCOR where R is an alkyl containing hydroxyl groups, in particular it may be a radical deriving from polyols such as ethylene glycol, glycerine, pentaerythritol. The compounds utilized as coupling agents according to this invention are employed in amounts ranging from 0.01 to 5 by weight referred to the total compounded polymer. The additives employable according to the present invention include stabilizers, opacifiers, organic and inorganic pigments, blowing agents, lubricants, antistatic agents, dyeing modifiers, hydrophilising agents and the like, either alone or in admixture with one another. As polyolefins in flakes use is made of the olefinic crystalline polymers, prepared by means of stereospecific cata lysts, more particularly the propylene polymers having prevailing isotactic macromolecules and the ethylene propylene crystalline copolymers prevailing containing propylene, either of the random type or in blocks. A particularly advantageous method of embodying this invention consists in preparing a concentrated mix of granular polymer, with a relatively high content of additive and of coupling agent, which is then mixed with the polymer as such in a suitable amount, in order to obtain the desired polymeric composition.
