# Methods of encapsulating electronic circuits.

## Abstract
In the manufacture of encapsulated hybrid circuits from a substrate e.g., 10 , having a plurality of such circuits e.g., 12 contained thereon, individual devices e.g., 14 are first mounted on the circuit, encapsulant having a yield point stress and viscosity so as not to creep or flow is applied around the periphery of each circuit on the substrate so as to form a wall or dam e.g., 16 around each such circuit except for the bonding pads e.g., 18 for external connection of each circuit, a second encapsulant e.g., 20 is then flow coated over the circuit and devices contained thereon within the previously formed wall such that the second encapsulant is retained within the wall. The encapsulants are then cured or dried and the individual encapsulated circuit can then be further processed such as by separating the individual circuits on the substrate and applying external connectors to the bonding pads Figure 3D .
