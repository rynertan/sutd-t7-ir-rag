# Threo adrenalinecarboxylic acid, processes for the production thereof, and pharmaceutical compositions thereof.

## Abstract
DL and L Threo 3 3,4 dihydroxyphenyl N methyl ser ine which may also be termed as DL and L threo adrenaline carboxylic acid are now provided, which are new compounds useful for therapeutic treatment of Parkinson s disease and mental depression disease. DL Adrenalinecarboxylic acid may be produced by a new process comprising reacting glycine with O protected 3,4 dihydroxybenzaldehyde, hydrolyzing the resultant reaction product under acidic conditions to form O protected DL 3 3,4 dihydroxyphenyl serine, isolating the O protected DL 3 3,4 dihydroxyphenyl serine into the threo isomer and the erythro isomer by recrystallization from a suit able organic solvent, introducing an unsubstituted or substi tuted benzyl group into the 2 amino group of the resulting O protected DL threo 3,4 dihydroxyphenyl serine, then N methylating the resulting O protected DL threo 3 3,4 dihy droxyphenyl N benzylserine, and removing the O protecting groups as well as the unsubstituted or substituted benzyl group at the 2 methylamino group of the N methylation pro duct. L threo Adrenalinecarboxylic acid may be produced by a new process corncrising intronucing a p methoxybenzyloxy carbonyl group into the 2 amino group of the O protected DL threo 3 3,4 dihydroxyphenyl serine obtained as an intermedi ate product, optically resolving the resultant O protected DL threo 3 3,4 dihyroxyphenyl N p methoxybenzyloxycarbo nyl serine by reacting the latter with an optically active amine and recrystallizing the resultant amine salt products from a suitable organic solvent, removing the p methoxybenzyloxy carbonyl group from the resultant O protected L threo 3,4 di hydroxyphenyl N p methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl serine, react ing the resultant O protected L threo 3,4 dihydroxyphe nyl serine with dimethyl sulfate in dry acetone to form an O protected L threo 3,4 dihydroxyphenyl N methylserine me thyl ester, saponifying this methyl ester and then removing the O protecting groups from the saponification product.
