## Description
PROCESS FOR MANUFACTURE OF LAMINATES EMPLOYING LIGNO SULFONATE EXTENDED PHENOLIC RESINSBackground of the Invention The present invention relates to the process of manufacturing laminates and, more particularly, the process of manufacturing laminates wherein lignosulfonate extended phenolic resins are employed for impregnating the core laminae of the laminate. Laminates, as their name suggests, consist of layers, or laminae, held together by a suitable binder.The laminae are usually materials such as paper, woven fabrics, mats or felts that are readily available in continuous sheet form. The binders are synthetic resins, frequently phenolic resins that are impregnated into the core laminae. After drying, several laminae are placed upon one another and the entire mass is consolidated under heat and pressure to form a rigid, infusible sheet which may be used for its mechanical, electrical, chemical or esthetic qualities. Paper is by far the most widely used laminating base. It is virtually the only core material used in decorative laminates and probably reinforces 50 of the industrial laminates on a squarefoot basis. Since several varieties of fiber are used in paper, the term paper, as used herein, will mean a cellulose fiber material unless otherwise noted. The most common paper is that derived from the Kraft process which, combined with phenolic resin, forms the structural core for decorative laminates and for low cost mechanical and electrical grades of industrial laminates. It is strong, cheap, plentiful, can be made moisture and fire resistant, and machines readily. Crepe papers are preferably used to obtain a degree of stretch in laminates during postfabrication.These are commonly present in postformable laminates and are usually Kraft papers containing resins or other agents which make creping possible. A so called X crepe is preferred that is, a paper creped in two directions which are approximately at 450 to the long axis of the paper.X creping allows the laminate produced therefrom to be formed in almost any direction. In decorative laminates, a decor layer is placed above the laminate core typically thoroughly refined alpha cellulose papers are used for the decor layer. One of these papers is heavily loaded with a suitable pigment, printed with a suitable print, pattern or design, impregnated with about 35 40 melamine formaldehyde resin and bonded directly to the laminating core mentioned above.To protect the print from external abuse a lighter, very clean, nonpigmented alpha cellulose paper is placed above the print. This alpha cellulose paper, or overlay, is impregnated with about 65 melamine formaldehyde resin. The overlay acts as a carrier and reinforces the melamine formaldehyde resin, thereby preventing crazing. In most laminates, the laminate core is generally prepared by saturating a Kraft paper with a solution of pheno f ormaldehyde resin in the resole stage. The saturated paper is then permitted to dry and a plurality of the dried papers are laid, in a face to face relationship, upon one another. In decorative laminates, an alpha cellulose decor sheet and some form of protective layering im pregnated with a melamine formaldehyde resin are placed above the laminating base. The assembled stack, when sub jetted to heat and pressure, becomes fused into the finished laminate. Phenol formaldehyde has generally been the preferred laminating resin because of its high degree of asso ciation with cellulose and its ability to render an increased water resistance to the paper, thus impaling dimensional stability to the laminate. These phenol formaldehyde resins, although water soluble at low molecular weights, often require the use of solvents other than water to maintain their solubility during the application operation. Suitable solvents have included methyl, ethyl and propyl alcohols as well as toluene. The increased demand for laminates has, however, produced a correspondingly increased demand on the component materials. This demand has caused shortages and rising costs throughout the industry. To combat these problems it has become necessary to look for new ways to increase the supply of these phenolic resins and decrease their steadily rising costs. Additionally, the enhanced awareness of environmental quality has made it desirable to reduce the residual phenols, formaldehydes and organic solvents that are apt. to escape into the atmosphere or present disposal problems in conjunction with the manufacture of these phenolic resins or their use in laminate production. Recently, the use of lignin extended phenol formaldehyde resins has been suggested as one means to overcome these problems. Lignin itself occurs in many living plants and grasses. Considering that approximately six 6 million tons of. lignin is either burned or disposed of in pulp mill effluents annually in the United States alone, this represents a potential source of supply in that wood is one of the few renewable resources. The disadvantage of this process however lies in the complex operations necessary to isolate pure lignin and the costs associated with this isolation. There exists, therefore, the need for a laminating resin which will incur lower manufacturing costs, be available in plentiful quantities, exhibit environmentally acceptable characteristics and still be capable of meeting the necessary requirements of strength, stability and water resistance when used for commercial laminates. Summary of the Invention The present invention provides a process for the manufacture of laminates employing a lignosulfonate extended phenolic resin for use in the laminate core. Utilization of this laminating resin degreases the quantities of phenols, formaldehydes and organic solvents employed in the manufacture of a laminating resin and therefore correspondingly reduces the cost of the manufactured laminate.This reduced quantity of resin components reduces the residual materials generated in the manufacture of the laminating resin thereby enhancing the overall quality of the environment. The suitability of laminates impregnated with the lignosulfonate extended phenol formaldehyde resin have been estabilished through a series of tests that have shown these laminates as fully meeting the requirements of strength, stability and water resistance.Detailed Description Of The Invention In accordance with the present invention there is provided a method of producing a heat and pressure consolidated laminate which comprises consolidating an assembly between press plates, the assembly comprising, in superimposed relation, a laminate core comprising a plurality of individual sheet members impregnated with a lignosulfate salt extended phenol formaldehyde thermosetting resin, a fibrous decor sheet impregnated with a melamine formaldehyde thermosetting resin and an overlay layer impregnated with a melamine formaldehyde thermosetting resin subjecting the assembly to a curing pressure and temperature to effect thermosetting and recovering the resultant laminate. The laminate core of the present invention contains a plurality of cellulosic sheets impregnated with the lignosulfonate extended phenol formaldehyde resin, preferably six sheets. These sheets can be caried in material in accordance with the particular properties desired in the laminate. Typically, paper is the material employed in the laminate core. In the instant invention a Kraft paper of about a 90 to 125 pound basis weight per 3000 square foot ream is preferred in the stock material from which the core sheets are prepared. Lignosulfonates, used in the preparation of the laminating resin of the present invention are yellow to dark brown amorphous powder. These lignosulfonates are derived from the black liquor of the kraft pulping process by acidifying the black liquor. They may be purchased commercially from most pulp manufacturers in the form of ammonium or sodium salts, however, the ammonium salt of lignosulfonate is preferred. The salt form is preferred because they are extremely water soluble in that they are derived from strong acids additionally, they can tolerate being mixed with methanol based phenol formaldehyde resins without precipitating out. The molecular weight of lignosulfonate generally ranges up to about 15,000, preferably from about 1,500 to about 15,000 in the instant invention. The lignosulfonate extended laminating resin employed in the present invention is prepared by refluxing a mixture of phenol and formaldehyde in the presence of a catalyst which may be added all at once, or incrementally, for approximately 10 to 20 minutes under atmospheric pressure or, alternatively, for 20 to 100 minutes under vacuum pressure. The phenol to formaldehyde mole ratio is in the range of about 1 1.2 to 1 2.0, preferably about 1 1.6. The endpoint of the reflux can be determined by checking the water tolerance of the resin prepared in 250C water. When the water tolerance is approximately in the range of 250100 , the reflux is complete. Urea crystals are next added while the solution is agitated for approximately 5 minutes.The charge is then dehydrated, if so desired, for about 2 hours under vacuum to provide a more concentrated resol solution. At this point an aqueous solution of an ammonium salt of lignosulfonate is added in the effective amount, preferably such that less than about 15 lignosulfonate extended resin has been prepared. The solution is vigorously mixed until a uniform resin is achieved. The laminating base sheets are then impregnated with the lignosulfonate extended phenol formaldehyde resin.This is performed by passing the base sheets through an impregnating bath containing the resin. The resin bath is a 50 solution of the lignosulfonate extended phenol formaldehyde resin. The laminate base sheets have a resin solids content in the range of about 20 to about 40 , preferably about 40 after impregnation. These sheets are then dried by passing them through a forced air drying oven with a temperature between 1400C and 17000. The resultant impregnated base sheet has a volatile content within the range of 3 to 10 . The core laminae may be combined with a decor sheet, typically a suitable print, pattern or design.The decor sheet is impregnated with a melamine formaldehyde resin in an amount equal to about 35 to 40 of the decor sheet. Additionally, an overlay sheet providing protection to the decor sheet from external abuse may be provided. This sheet is also an alpha cellulose paper impregnated with a melamine formaldehyde resin. The overlay sheet needs to be of a transparent or translucent nature to allow the decor sheet to show through and thus a highly refined alpha cellulose sheet is employed. This overlay sheet is generally impregnated with about 65 melamine formaldehyde resin to impart strength and resistance to the sheet. Preferably, the above mentioned sheets are then assembled such that approximately six 6 impregnated sheets constitute a core layer, typically in face to face relation, on top of this can be placed the decor sheet with its print, pattern or design facing outward, and on top of this cah be placed the overlay sheet. The assembly is placed between two stainless steel plates and subjected to a curing temperature and pressure for approximately 20 minutes. This curing pressure is in excess of 1,000 psi and at a temperature of between about 1200C to about 18000. The following specific examples illustrate certain aspects of the present invention, and more particularly, point out methods of evaluating the properties of laminates employing a lignosulfonate extended phenol formaldehyde resin. However, the examples are set forth for illustration only and are not to be construed as limitations on the present invention except as set forth in the appended claims.
