## Description
The present invention relates to a process for preparing optically active indoline 2 carboxylic acid by an optical resolution, which comprises subjecting a racemic ester of R,S indoline 2 carboxylic acid having the general formula R,S I wherein R is an alkyl or alkenyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms an alkyl or alkenyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms substituted with either hydroxyl group or a halogen atom, or simultaneously substituted with both hydroxyl group and a halogen atom a substituted or unsubstituted aromatic hydrocarbon group or substituted or unsubstituted phenyl or benzyl group, to the action of an enzyme or a microorganism having a stereo selective esterase activity, which is capable of asymmetrically hydrolyzing the racemic ester R,S I to give optically active indoline 2 carboxylic acid having the formula II so as to produce the hydrolysis product, i.e. optically active indoline 2 carboxylic acid II and an unreacted optically active ester of indoline 2 carboxylic acid having the general formula I wherein R is as above, isolating each optically active form, and further, if necessary, hydrolyzing the obtained optically active ester I to give an optical antipode of the acid II . The present invention also relates to a process for preparing optically active indoline 2 carboxylic acid by immobilizing the microorganism or the enzyme on the support and utilizing the affinity difference between indoline 2 carboxylic acid and ester of indoline 2 carboxylic acid to the immobilizing support, which comprises eluting hydrophilic optically active indoline 2 carboxylic acid with water or a buffer solution, and then hydrolyzing with alkali optically active ester of indoline 2 carboxylic acid which is adsorbed and retained on the support, followed by elution of optically active indoline 2 carboxylic acid II which has an opposite optical rotation based on the previously obtained optically active indoline 2 carboxylic acid. The process of the present invention can produce R indoline 2 carboxylic acid and ester of S indoline 2 carboxylic acid, S indoline 2 carboxylic acid and ester of R indoline 2 carboxylic acid, or simultaneously both R and S indoline 2 carboxylic acids. These optically active indoline 2 carboxylic acids can be used as a starting material for synthesizing various kinds of drug. For example, S indoline 2 carboxylic acid can be used for synthesizing S 1 S mercapto 2 oxopropyl indoline 2 carboxylic acid having the formula which is an antihypertensive drug effective as an inhibitor for Angiotensin I converting enzyme, and the like J. Med. Chem. Hitherto, these optically active indoline 2 carboxylic acids have been prepared by using the agent for optical resolution as follows Japanese unexamined Patent Publication No. 81460 1982 M. Vincent el al., Tetrahedron Letters, S form is extracted from mother liquid. J. Med. Chem., However, these processes are too complicated and thus a more simple process for preparing optically active indoline 2 carboxylic acid or optically active ester of indoline 2 carboxylic acid has been desired for the production on a large scale. The present inventors have studied, in order to establish a simple process for preparing optically active indoline 2 carboxylic acid, by esterifying indoline 2 carboxylic acid with various alcohols and then subjecting the obtained ester to the action of a microorganism or an enzyme. As the result, it was found by the present inventors as follows Hitherto, it has not yet been reported that optically active indoline 2 carboxylic acid can be prepared by the asymmetric hydrolysis of ester of indoline 2 carboxylic acid with enzyme or microorganism, that racemic ester of indoline 2 carboxylic acid is asymmetrically hydrolyzed with immobilized enzyme while the reaction product is simultaneously separated, and then unreacted ester adsorbed on the support is hydrolyzed with alkali, the product of hydrolysis being eluted, and that these processes can be carried out continuously. In accordance with the present invention, there can be provided a process for preparing R indoline 2 carboxylic acid having the formula R II by an optical resolution, and a process for preparing optically active indoline 2 carboxylic acid having the formula II Examples of ester of indoline 2 carboxylic acid having the general formula R,S I wherein R is an alkyl or alkenyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms an alkyl or alkenyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms substituted with either hydroxyl group or a halogen atom, or simultaneously substituted with both hydroxyl group and a halogen atom a substituted or unsubstituted aromatic hydrocarbon group or substituted or unsubstituted phenyl or benzyl group, which is used as a substrate in the present invention, are esters with, for instance, methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, amino alcohol, hexanol, heptanol, octanol, ethylene glycol, glycerol, glycerol α monochlorohydrin, 2,3 dichloro 1 propanol or 1,3,5 pentanetriol. Ester of indoline 2 carboxylic acid R,S I can be obtained as follows i.e. to R,S indoline 2 carboxylic acid is added alcohol, which serves as both solvent and reaction reagent, to conduct condensation reaction in 5 to 40 W V concentration of indoline 2 carboxylic acid under strong acidic condition at a temperature ranging from 50 C to reflux temperature for 1 to 5 hours. Then, to the reaction mixture a saturated aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate is added to adjust to pH 7, followed by extraction with a hydrophobic organic solvent such as ethyl acetate, chloroform, methylene chloride, toluene or hexane, and further concentration to give ester of R,S indoline 2 carboxylic acid R,S I with a high purity. Examples of microorganism which has a stereo selective activity for asymmetrically hydrolyzing racemic ester R,S I to give R II are those of genus such as, for instance, Examples of microorganism which has a stereo selective esterase activity capable of asymmetrically hydrolyzing racemic ester R,S I to give S II are those of the genus such as, for instance, The strains of the above microorganisms have been deposited at IFO Institute For Fermentation, Osaka, Japan , ATCC American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, VSA , CBS Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures, Baarn, Netherlands , IAM Institute of Applied Microbiology, University of Tokyo, Japan or HUT Faculty of Engineering, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan . These microorganisms can be cultured with any culture medium on which the microorganisms can multiply such as, for instance, culture medium comprising glucose, peptone, yeast extract, meat extract, and the like. The culture of the microorganism is usually carried out under aerobic condition at from 10 to 40 C, preferably from 25 to 35 C, at pH ranging from 3 to 8, preferably from 6 to 7, for 24 to 48 hours. The asymmetric hydrolysis of ester of indoline 2 carboxylic acid with microorganism can be carried out by adding the substrate, racemic ester R,S I , to the culture medium when starting culture of the microorganism so that culture of the microorganism and hydrolysis of the racemic ester are conducted simultaneously. Altenatively, it may be carried out by adding racemic ester R,S I to the culture medium containing cells which is obtained after culturing the microorganism,or by adding R,S I to the cell suspension, wherein cells obtained from centrifugation or filtration after culturing the microorganism are suspended in a buffer solution. In order to achieve better recovering of the product after hydrolysis reaction, the hydrolysis reaction is preferably carried out in such a way that after concentrating the cells by centrifugation, filtration and the like, the cell suspension with a high concentration is prepared, to which racemic ester R,S I is added. Though some of ester R,S I has a low solubility in water, this would not disturb the hydrolysis reaction if the reaction is carried out with stirring. In such a case, also an organic solvent such as, for instance, acetone or methanol, or a detergent may be added to the reaction mixture in such an amount that would not interrupt the hydrolysis reaction. The reaction is carried out at a temperature ranging from 10 to 50 C, preferably from 25 to 35 C, at pH ranging from 5 to 8, preferably from 6.5 to 7.5. Though the reaction time varies depending on a ratio between an amount of the substrate and that of the cells, the reaction may be stopped when a molar ratio of 1 1 between the unreacted ester and the produced carboxylic acid is achieved. However, in view of the activity of the cells in the reaction, an amount of the substrate to be added should be such that the ratio of 1 1 is achieved within 12 to 48 hours. Also since pH value of the reaction mixture is inclined to shift to the acidic side as the hydrolysis reaction proceeds, the pH of the reaction mixture is preferably maintained at from 6 to 7 with a neutralizing agent such as, for instance, NaOH. As the enzyme from the microorganism, crude enzyme, which is obtained by crushing the cells of the microorganism followed by fractionation with ammonium sulfate or treatment with acetone, or purified enzyme, which is obtained by further purifying the crude enzyme with column chromatography, can be employed. Examples of commercially available enzyme for producing R II are, for instance, Bioplase AL 15 origine For conducting the asymmetric hydrolysis reaction, the substrate racemic ester R,S I is suspended in the reaction mixture with a concentration of 2 to 30 W V and thereto a proper amount of the enzyme is added. The amount of the enzyme is preferably such that, for instance, a ratio of the enzyme to the substrate by weight is from 1 5 to 1 1000. Then the reaction is carried out at a temperature ranging from 10 to 40 C, preferably from 25 to 35 C, while an amount of produced carboxylic acid and a decreased amount of ester of carboxylic acid are measured with high performance liquid chromatography, and the reaction is stopped when 1 1 of a molar ratio between I and II in the reaction mixture is obtained. Though the reaction may be carried out at pH value ranging from 4 to 8.5, the pH of the reaction mixture is preferably maintained at from 6 to 7 with a neutralizing agent such as, for instance, NaOH solution since pH value of the reaction mixture is inclined to shift to the acidic side as the hydrolysis reaction proceeds. After asymmetric hydrolysis with the microorganism or the enzyme, the pH of the reaction mixture is adjusted to 7 and then only optically active ester of indoline 2 carboxylic acid I is extracted with a hydrophobic organic solvent such as ethyl acetate, chloroform, methylene chloride or hexane so that I is separated from hydrophilic optically active indoline 2 carboxylic acid II . Though the thus obtained optically active ester may be concentrated as such to give the ester with a high optical purity, it can be converted into optically active indoline 2 carboxylic acid as follows i.e. optically active ester of indoline 2 carboxylic acid S I or R I is hydrolyzed with alkali at room temperature at pH ranging from 9 to 11 for 10 minutes to 2 hours to give S II or R II respectively. Alternatively, S I or R I is subjected to the action of the enzymes capable of specifically hydrolyzing S I or R I such as, for instance, Lipoprotein lipase Amano 3 made by Amano Pharmaceutical Co. for S I and Steapsin made by Wako Purechemical Industries, Ltd. for R I , or to the action of the microorganism capable of specifically hydrolyzing S I or R I to give S II or R II respectively. The pH of the solution obtained after hydrolysis is adjusted to 4 to 6, preferably around 5.0, and the resultant is then extracted with an organic solvent such as methylen chloride, ethyl acetate, toluene or hexane, followed by concentration and crystallization. in an organic solvent such as acetone to give S II or R II with a high optical purity. On the other hand, optically active indoline 2 carboxylic acid remained in the water layer after extraction of ester of indoline 2 carboxylic acid can also be treated as above, i.e. the pH of the solution is adjusted to 4 to 6, preferably around 5.0, and then the extraction as mentioned above is conducted to give R II or S II with a high optical purity. The immobilized enzyme or the immobilized microorganism can be prepared by immobilizing the above mentioned commercially available enzyme or cells obtained after culturing the microorganism as such on a hydrophobic resin. Alternatively, the cells are crushed and then fractionation with ammonium sulfate or treatment with acetone is carried out to give a crude enzyme, which is immobilized on a hydrophobic resin as such or after further purification. Various hydrophobic supports may be employed in the present invention as the support for immobilizing the enzyme. The hydrophobic support employed in the present invention does not adsorb hydrophilic compound II produced in the asymmetric hydrolysis reaction in water or a buffer solution but adsorb the unreacted ester I through hydrophobic interaction and preferably has a stability even in an alkaline range of pH 8 to 10. Examples of such support are, for instance, a hydrophobic synthetic resin, a hydrophobic resin for chromatography, hydrophobic photo induced crosslinked resin, hydrophobic urethan prepolymer, a macromolecule material in which a hydrophobic group is introduced by a chemical bonding, and the like. Immobilization of the enzyme on such support can be carried out by various known methods such as physical adsorption, covalent bonding, ionic bonding, cross linking and entrapping methods. In case of immobilization of the microorganism, entrapping method and the like may be employed edited by Fukui, Chibata and Suzuki, Kosokogaku , P 157 243, Kodansha, 1981 edited by Ichiro Chibata, Koteikakoso , Kodansha, 1975 . In the industrial process, the immobilized enzyme is preferably prepared by allowing the enzyme to be physically adsorbed on a hydrophobic synthetic adsorbent while the immobilized microorganism is preferably prepared by entrapping the cells in hydrophobic photo induced crosslinked resin or urethan prepolymer resin in view of simplicity of the process, mechanical strength of the support and economical reason. Though an amount of the enzyme or microorganism immobilized on the support cannot be sweepingly determined since it varies depending on a immobilizing capacity of the support, the amount of the enzyme immobilized on the support may be about 0.1 to about 100 mg, usually about 1 to 20 mg per 1 g wet weight of the support while the amount of the cells immobilized on the support may be 0.1 to 1 g, usually about 0.15 to about 0.5 g per 1 g wet weight of the support. Though an amount of the substrate which can be loaded on a column filled with the immobilized enzyme or the immobilized microorganism varies depending on a kind of the immobilizing support and that of the substrate ester, the substrate can be loaded on a column in the highest amount as far as the unreacted substrate is not eluted while the substrate is loaded or when a buffer solution is passed through a column. For example, when the immobilized enzyme, wherein the support is a synthetic adsorbent Amberlite XAD 7 , is filled in a column and the substrate is ester with ethylene glycol, up to 1 5 amount of the substrate based on the column volume can be loaded. For loading the substrate, the substrate is merely placed on the upper part of the column and thereto a buffer solution is added in a column process, or the substrate is mixed with the immobilized enzyme or the immobilized microorganism in a batch process. The asymmetric hydrolysis reaction of the present invention can be conducted usually at a temperature ranging from 10 to 60 C, preferably from 20 to 40 C. The reaction of the present invention can be carried out at pH ranging from 4.5 to 10, preferably from 6 to 7.5 to give the maximum reaction rate. Since the pH value of the reaction mixture is lowered by indoline 2 carboxylic acid which is produced as the reaction proceeds, the pH is preferably maintained in a fixed range with a buffer solution and the like when a large amount of the substrate is loaded. Buffer solutions of both inorganic acid salt and organic acid salt can be employed for this purpose. The unreacted ester adsorbed on the immobilizing support for the immobilized enzyme or the immobilized microorganism can be hydrolyzed with alkali at such a pH that does not inactivate the activity of the immobilized enzyme or the immobilized microorganism and can hydrolyze the ester. Though such pH value varies depending on a kind of the enzyme or that of the microorganism, the hydrolysis with alkali is usually carried out at pH 8 to 10. When the reaction of the present invention is carried out in a column process, a buffer solution is preferably employed in order to maintain the pH value in the system. The immobilized enzyme or the immobilized microorganism is filled in a column and thereto a buffer solution at pH 7.0 is added. Then the substrate ester R,S I is loaded and thereto the buffer solution is further added to conduct the asymmetric hydrolysis reaction. The produced hydrophilic compound II is dissolved in the buffer solution and then eluted from the column. The fraction of the eluted buffer solution is analyzed with a high performance liquid chromatography Finepak SIL C₁₈ , developing solvent acetonitrile water 15 1 V V , detector UV 215 nm . When the compound II can scarcely be detected, a buffer solution at pH 8 to 10 in place of the buffer solution at pH 7.0 is added to hydrolyze the unreacted ester I which is adsorbed on the immobilized enzyme or the immobilized microorganism in the column. The produced compound II having an opposite optical rotation based on the previously obtained hydrophilic compound II is desorbed from the immobilized enzyme or from the immobilized microorganism and then eluted. The fraction of this buffer solution is subjected to the high performance liquid chromatography as above. When the compound II can scarcely be detected in the fraction, the buffer solution at pH 7.0 in place of the buffer solution at pH 8 to 10 is added to the column and again the substrate ester R,S I is loaded. By repeating the above mentioned processes, it is possible to consecutively conduct the asymmetric hydrolysis of the compound R,S I , separation of the reaction product and hydrolysis with alkali. When the asymmetric hydrolysis reaction of the racemic compound R,S I is carried out in a batch process using the immobilized enzyme or the immobilized microorganism, a water layer containing hydrophilic optically active compound II and the immobilized enzyme or the immobilized microorganism, to which the unreacted hydrophobic optically active compound I is adsorbed, are separated from each other by filtration or moderate centrifugation. The ester adsorbed on the immobilized enzyme or the immobilized microorganism is hydrolyzed with an alkaline solution, which is adjusted to pH 8 to 10 in order not to inactivate the immobilized enzyme or the immobilized microorganism, or with a buffer solution at pH 8 to 10. The hydrolyzed product is desorbed from the immobilized enzyme or the immobilized microorganism to give the optically active compound II having an opposite optical rotation based on the previously obtained II . The immobilized enzyme or the immobilized microorganism can be reused in the reaction. The pH of the obtained fraction containing indoline 2 carboxylic acid is adjusted to around 5.0 and then concentration, crystallization, precipitation and filtration are successively carried out to give indoline 2 carboxylic acid. Alternatively, after saturating the obtained fraction with ammonium sulfate, the pH of the fraction is adjusted to around 5.0 and extraction with an organic solvent such as ethyl acetate or methylene chloride is carried out, followed by concentration to give indoline 2 carboxylic acid. If necessary, crystallization in an organic solvent such as acetone may further be carried out. The present invention is more particularly described by the following Examples. However, it should be understood that the present invention is not limited to the Examples and various changes and modifications can be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention.

In the above elution procedures with the phosphate buffer and with hexane, the desorption of the enzyme was not observed. After passing 50 ml of 0.1 M phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 through the column employed in Example 91 in which immobilized Steapsin is filled, 5 g of racemic amyl indoline 2 carboxylate R,S Ia was loaded on the column, followed by the hydrolysis reaction with the phosphate buffer, elution of produced carboxylic acid and elution of the unreacted ester with hexane as in Example 91. A series of the above reactions and the elution procedures were repeated 20 times and in every course each fraction of the phosphate buffer and fraction of the hexane eluate were treated as in Example 91. As the result, each fraction of the phosphate buffer gave R indoline 2 carboxylic acid R II having a specific rotatory power α 25 D ranging from 31.9 to 33.1 c 1.0, DMFA with a yield ranging from 1.21 to 1.27 g yield from R,S Ia 69 to 73 .
