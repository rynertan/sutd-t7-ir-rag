## Description
SEPARATION OF ETHYLBENZENE FROM XYLENES The separation of the various C8 aromatic isomers from one another is well known in the chemical industry because of the usefulness of the different xylene isomers and ethylbenzene. Commercially, industry has concentrated its efforts on the recovery of para xylene and among the well known recovery techniques are crystallization and and adsorptive separation with molecular sieves. The separation and recovery of ethylbenzene is also desirable, e.g. as an intermediate in the manufacture of styrene, however, industry has had considerably less success in its recovery. Various molecular sieves are disclosed as being selective for ethylbenzene, see U.S. Patents 3,943,182 and 4,175,099 where Group 1A exchangedZeolite X is selective for ethylbenzene. However, the preponderance of literature discloses molecular sieves such as Types X and Y being selective for para xylene over ethylbenzene. See US. Patents 3,558,730 and 4,069,172 which disclose separating para xylene with a Type X or Y faujasite adsorbent containing barium and or potassium.U.S. Patent 3,558,732 dislcoses separation of para xylene with a Type X or Y zeolite with toluene as a desorbent, with benzene disclosed as being undesirable and inferior as a desorbent still selective for para xylene but less than toluene . U.S. Patents 3,626,020, 3,665,046, 3,663,638 and 3,686,343 disclose separation of para xylene with various combinations of ion exchanges of Zeolite Y.Also of interest is UK Patent 1,307,264 which discloses para xylene selectivity for a potassium Type Y molecular sieve. The use of benzene as a desorbent or inert car river is known and disclosed in a number of the above cited patents relating to the recovery of para xylene. Rowever, the reversal of elution order with the use of high con centrations of benzene in the eluent with a potassiumType Y molecular sieve is both unexpected and useful in the efficient separation of ethylbenzene.SUMMARY OF INVENTION A process is disclosed for preferentially adsorbing and separating ethylbenzene from a feedstream containing the C8 aromatic isomers of ethylbenzene and paraxylene by contacting the feedstream and an eluent with a potassium Type Y molecular sieve, and desorbing the adsorbed ethyl benzene. The eluent has a high concentration of benzene which reverses the elution order of paraxylene and ethylbenzene providing a sieve which preferentially adsorbs ethylbenzene over para xylene.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION According to the present invention it has unexpectedly been discovered that ethylbenzene is preferentially adsorbed from a feedstream admixture with at least one other C8 aromatic including para xylene when said mixture is contacted, under adsorption conditions, with a potassiumType Y molecular sieve i.e. containing predominantly potassium ions and utilizing an eluent containing a high concentration of benzene. By predominantly potassium ions it is meant that 75 99 preferably at least 80 , more preferably at least 97 of the sodium has been exchanged with potassium, preferably 80 99t and most preferably 85 988. The adsorption may take place in either the liquid or vapour phase.The benzene is present on the sieve bed in high concentrations when the feedstream is passed over the sieve in order to obtain the preferential adsorption of ethylbenzene over paraxylene. The eluent is defined as containing the desorbent and optionally an inert carrier and used to desorb the adsorbed ethylbenzene. The adsorption of the ethylbenzene may take place at temperatures which vary broadly between 30 and 850OF 1 and 455 C and the pressure may vary between 0.01 and 50 atmospheres. The eluent critically contains a high concentration of benzene which unexpectedly reverses the adsorptive ability of the potassium exchange Type Y molecular sieve so that ethylbenzene is preferentially adsorbed over all other C8 aromatics including para xylene. With the eluent containing a high concentration of benzene the order in which the R Y sieve preferentially adsorbs is ethylbenzene para xylene ortho xylene meta xylene thus allowing for the separation and recovery of ethylbenzene. The selectivity of ethylbenzene para xylene achieved by this process is generally 1.5 to 6. In adsorptive separation processes an important factor that is used to determine the ability of a particular adsorbent to separate components of a feed is the selectivity of the adsorbent for one component as compared to another component.The selectivity as used throughout this specification is defined as the ratio of the two components of the adsorbed phase over the ratio of the same two components in the unadsorbed phase at equilibrium conditions.Expressed in equation form Selectivity vol. percent C vol. percent D3A vol. percent C vol. percent D u where C and D are two components of the feed represented in volume percent and the subscripts A and U represent the adsorbed and unadsorbed phase respectively. The equilibrium conditions as defined here were determined when the feed passing over a bed of adsorbent did not change composition after contacting the bed of adsorbent or in other words there was no net transfer of material occurring between the unadsorbed and adsorbed phases. The benzene is present in the eluent and on the sieve in an amount effective to achieve the preferential adsorption of ethylbenzene over para xylene, which amount can vary depending upon the amount of the feedstream.The concentration of benzene required in the eluent is at least 5 , preferably at least 40 by weight. The remainder of the eluent comprises an inert carrier. Inert carriers which may be utilized include the following Aromatics which are less tightly adsorbed than the xylenes, paraffins both normal and iso , olefins, naphthenes, and mixtures of the above. The basic requirements for an inert carrier are 1 a material liquid or gas at reaction conditions which does not react with the xylenes or molecular sieve at adsorption or desorption conditions 2 which can easily be separated from the xylene product and 3 does not effect the reversal of elution order.Examples are paraffins from C2 to C15 iso and normal , olefins from C2 to C18 normal and branched , tetralin, decal in, and halogenated or oxygenated derivatives of the above. The preferred carrier for use with benzene in the eluent are low molecular weight paraffins. These are effective for unadsorbed xylene removal and can be easily separated from the ethylbenzene product, e.g. pentane, hexane or heptane In U.S. Patent 3,130,007 there is described the zeolite Type Y molecular sieve. The crystals of Zeolite TypeY are basically 3 dimensional framework of SiO4 andAl203 tetrahedra cross linked by the sharing of oxygen atoms. The valence of each tetrahedron containing aluminium is balanced by the presence in the aluminosilicate framework of a cation such as sodium ion. The void spaces in the framework are occupied by water molecules. Dehydration to effect the lowest order of hydration results in a crystal interlaced with channels of molecular dimension which offer high selectivity and surface area for the adsorption of particular molecules. The basic chemical formula for zeolite Y expressed in terms of moles of oxides may be written as 0.9 0.2 Na2O Al203 WsiO2 XE20 where W is a value greater than three and up to about 6 and X may be a value to about 9. The ion exchange of the Type Y molecular sieve with potassium may be accomplished by any of the several different techniques known to those skilled in the art.Purely by way of non limitative example, the following technique is given as a preferred method of ion exchanging the sodium for potassium. The sodium form of the Type Y molecular sieve is treated hydrothermally with an aqueous solution of a potassium salt chloride, nitrite or carbonate are preferred.The treatment involves agitation of the powdered Type Y sieve particles with the solution at temperatures from about ambient to 180 to 220F 82 to 105 C . An excess of potassium ion is present above that required to replace the sodium ions ordinarily found in Type Y sieve stoichiometrically. A minimum of a 2 mole excess is preferred. After equilibration of the sieve with the exchange solution, usually in one or two hours, the excess of liquid is removed by filtration, decantation, or centrifugation. A second treatment is then carried out in the same manner, followed by a third and fourth if it is desired to obtain the maximum exchange of ions. A minimum of at least 2 treatments should be employed. The liquid is removed and the solid particles are washed free of chloride ions, if potassium chloride is used as the exchange salt or source of potassium ions. The solid particles are then dried, and formed into pellets, extrudates, or any other desired form for use. They are calcined at temperatures of up to 1200 F 649C , in air, prior to actual use in order to remove any excess water and to destroy any nitrate or carbonate ions which remain if these materials are used as exchange salts. The feed stream for the separation process of the invention may be obtained from any of several sources.Briefly, a mixed Cg aromatic feed stream containing the various xylene isomers and ethylbenzene may result from steam cracking of hydrocarbon oils, from coal tar sources, or from the reforming of hydrocarbon oils in petroleum process operations. In any case, a C8 aromatics fraction is concentrated prior to separation, by distillation or other suitable means. In addition, the C8 aromatic product or feed stream to an aromatic isomerization process may be used as feed for the process. A typical mixture to be treated by the process of the invention would have about 10 to 30 wt. t of para xylene, 30 to 50 wt. of meta xylene, 10 to 30 wt. of ortho xylene and 10 to 30 wt. ethylbenzene. Any combination of ethylbenzene and the other xylene isomers provides a suitable feed stream for the invention.The feed stream is passed over the predominantly potassium exchanged Type Y molecular sieve in either the liquid or vapor phase. The mixture is passed over the molecular sieve in the vapour phase generally at a rate of 0.01 to 10 weight feedstream hr. weight of sieve. The adsorption technique of this invention can be cyclic, or a continuous process. When a cyclic process is used, typical cycle times will vary between 2 and 480 minutes. Temperatures during adsorption may vary widely in the vapour phase. Acceptable limits would vary from 200 800 F 90 425 C , preferably 200 700 F 90 370 C and most preferably 300 600 F 150 315 C . In the liquid phase the temperature may vary between 30 and 300 F 0 150 C while preferred temperatures are between7 0 and 210OF 20 100 C . The pressure may vary widely acceptable limits are between 0.1 and 700 psig 689 and 4830000Nm 2, in both the liquid and vapor phases.For a vapor phase operation, a preferred pressure would be between 0.1 and 100 psig 689 and 690000Nm 2 . Pressure in the liquid phase should be sufficient to maintain liquid phase at the temperature utilized. The eluent is introduced at a level which provides a eluent to feed by weight ratio of generally 2 to 20, preferably 2 to 6. The presence of the benzene in the eluent is critical to the preferential adsorption and recovery of ethylbenzene and is important to successful operation in the liquid phase because the eluent serves to sweep the interstices of the sieve while the feed stream is passed over it. Following ethylbenzene adsorption on the sieve, the ethylbenzene is desorbed with the eluent.The preferred method of using liquid phase adsorption is as follows 1 Pass eluent over the sieve 2 The mixed xylene and ethylbenzene feed stream is fed over the sieve in the liquid phase, with a raffinate stream being withdrawn which is depleted in ethylbenzene 3 The adsorbent is desorbed by passing the eluent over the sieve producing an extract which contains the eluent and is rich in ethylbenzene and 4 The extract containing ethylbenzene and eluent is then fractionated to separate the ethylbenzene. Thus, when desorption takes place the product recovered is essentially ethylbenzene. Contaminants such as paraxylene, meta xylene or ortho xylene are minimized since they have been swept from the interstices and are substantially absent from the sieve. It should be emphasized that although the preferred separation of the invention is that of ethylbenzene from at least one of the xylene isomers, the invention may be used to obtain any one of the C8 aromatics used in pure form by proper use of adsorption and desorption techniques and stages. As mentioned, previously, there is a definite order which the various xylene isomers and ethylbenzene will be attracted to a predominantly potassium exchange Type Y molecular sieve when using a eluent containing a high concentration of benzene. The desorption is by use of an eluent contain desorbent and comprises a high concentration of and may contain inert carriers as well. Deorption may be effected by passing the desorbent over the loaded bed.The eluent may be passed over the sieve in configurations such as countercurrently, concurrently or by cross flow in either a cyclic or continuous process. Typical temperatures during desorption will vary between 30 and 7OOeF, 0 370 C , preferably for liquid phase from 70 to 210iC 20 100C . Pressure would vary between 0.1 and 700 psig, preferably 10 to 100 psig. For a cyclic process, typical cycles for desorption vary between 10 and 120 minutes, preferably 20 and 60 minutes.EXAMPLE I In this example a mixed C8 aromatic feed containing para xylene, meta xylene, ortho xylene and ethylbenzene was treated with a potassium exchanged Type Y molecular sieve K Y faujasite in order to separate the ethylbenzene. The feed stream comprised the following amount of each component. Feed Wt. p xylene PX 10 m xylene MX 40 ethylbenzene EB 10 ortho xylene OX 10 nonane 30 A liquid chromatograph was used to test the adsorbentdesorbent system. The liquid chromatograph had a column length X internal diameter of 91.4 cm X .41 cm and was packed with K Y faujasite with a flow rate set at 0.25 ml min and at a temperature of 25 C. After the eluent containing 50 by wt. of benzene and 50 by wt. of hexane had soaked the sieve, a sample of feedstream was injected into the liquid chromatographic bed, followed by desorption with the eluent. The resultant elution order is shown in Figure 1 which demonstrates the preferential adsorption of ethylbenzene over the other C8 aromatics obtained with an eluent containing benzene, allowing for the separation of ethylbenzene. The selectivity of EB PX was 1.76 while the selectivity of EB MX was 2.74.EXAMPLE II As in Example I, a mixed C8 aromatic feed containing para xylene, meta xylene, ortho xylene and ethylbenzene was treated with a potassium exchanged Type Y mo3ecular sieve IK Y faujasite . In this example the eluent comprised 50 wt. toluene and 50 wt. hexane. The feed stream comprised the following amount of each component Feed wt. p xylene PX 15 m xylene MX 40 ethylbenzene EB 15 ortho xylene OX 15 nonane 15 A liquid chromatograph was used as in Example I to test the adsorbent desorbent system. After the eluent containing 50 by wt. of toluene and 50 by wt. of hexane had soaked the sieve, a sample of feedstream wás injected into the liquid chromatographic bed, followed by desorption with the eluent. The resultant elution order is shown in Figure II which demonstrates the preferential adsorption of paraxylene over the other C8 aromatics including ethylbenzene obtained with an eluent containing toluene. The selectivity of EB PX was 0.36 indicates selectivity for para xylene over ethylbenzene , while the selectivity of EB MX was 2.57.
