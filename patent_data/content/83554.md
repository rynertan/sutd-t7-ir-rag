# Electrocatalytic electrode.

## Abstract
An electrode, especially for chlorine and hypochlorite pro duction, comprises an electrocatalyst consisting of 22 55 mol ruthenium oxide, 0.2 22 mol palladium oxide and 44 77.8 mol titanium oxide. The electrocatalyst may form a coating on a valve metal substrate and may be topcoated with a porous layer of titanium or tantalum oxide.
