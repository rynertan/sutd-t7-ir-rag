## Description
This invention relates to a deformable substrate provided with a flexible and deformable label in accordance with the preamble of claim 1. The label, coated with a pressure sensitive adhesive, will decorate and conform to the surface of polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene and other flexible substrates e.g. containers . The label has the advantages that it is deformable and non shrinking, and has improved adhesion, so that the label is essentially a permanent part of the system, similar in appearance and mechanical performance to the surface of the substrate itself. The packaging industry has increasingly evolved to the use of flexible materials in place of rigid glass and metal in containers for both solids and liquids. Where items of oil and water based fluid categories, as for example, milk, beer, catsup, mustard, sugar syrups, soaps, cooking oil or motor oil, to name a few, were packaged in glass or metal containers, they are now more often packaged in plastic containers. Certain of these containers being polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene terephthalate, and the like are flexible by their nature and are intended to be deformable in that the container may change its shape during the course of its manufacture, processing, or use cycle, and upon removal of the deforming force, return to its original shape or dimension. This, of course, has advantages of design, manufacture and display as well as in protection and dispensing of the products. It also has certain disadvantages, one of these being that conventional labels of paper do not expand and contract uniformly with the bottle substrate during hot filling operations, and do not flex or deform during mechanical handling and end use without wrinkling, creasing, tearing or otherwise suffering permanent damage to the label. Previously, deformable bottles, packages or parts provided with flexible and deformable labels have been approached generally in three ways 1 by printing directly on the substrate, 2 by using flexible polyvinyl chloride labels, and 3 by heat transfer printing and decorating. Each of these methods, in addition to being more expensive than conventional paper labels, has other drawbacks as well. Direct printing, as for example that system disclosed in United States Patent No. 3,249,044, has obvious l imitations of design and ability to be incorporated into a high volume production line manufacturing method. Using vinyl PVC films in deformable labels is well known and is practiced effectively in a variety of applications. Vinyl, however, has chemical and physical characteristics which are limiting in several notable respects. Polyvinyl chloride in unmodified form, is rigid and must be highly plasticized and stabilized to be sufficiently flexible and stable for use in applications such as deformable label film. The physical and chemical characteristics of these highly modified vinyl films result in limitations of film thickness, dimensional stability during hot filling or other thermal operations, compatibility migration of plasticizers and stabilizers with adhesives and substrates and in shelf life. Heat transfer printing and decoration, as for example that disclosed in British Patent No 1,487,749, while faster than direct printing is still slow relative to current general purpose labelling lines. FR A 2,484,115 proposes the use of a film of polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene or polypropylene as a deformable label. Although the density of the polyethylene is not disclosed, the only reasonable deduction which could be made is that it must be high density polyethylene. However, high density polyethylene film has, in practice, been found to be unsuitable to be used as deformable labels, and prior to this time, it was generally accepted that polyethylene homopolymer films were not suitable to the printing, handling and adhesion requirements of this demanding application. I have now discovered that a deformable substrate provided with a label comprised of certain polyethylene film materials, together with selected adhesive as provided in the later sections of this specification, is unique in the ability of the label to function essentially as an integral part of the package itself, allowing bottles, packages, parts and the like, not only to be pre labeled prior to hot filling or other thermal or mechanically abusive operations, but also to provide the same resistance to thermal, and or mechanical deformations, as well as chemical resistance throughout an extended use and shelf life period. According to the present invention, there is provided a deformable substrate and label combination of the type basically disclosed in FR A 2484115, and as claimed in claim 1. Claims 2 and 3 concern particular embodiments of the invention. The label is unique in the ability to adhere to flexible and deformable surfaces throughout cycles of severe mechanical stress, temperature change or atmospheric exposure without shrinking, wrinkling, loosening, scratching or otherwise defacing. The label is comprised of certain low to medium density polyethylene films, which are 0.5 to 5 mil .0127 to .127 mm in thickness and which are corona treated or otherwise modified to render the surface more suitable for printing and for essentially permanent bonding with certain adhesives which are suitable to the invention and which are generally described as pressure sensitive, which adhesives are further characterised by their ability to cure to a permanent set while maintaining an elastic nature. The label may be printed or decorated in a manner conventional to the art, and when affixed to a substrate and cured in the manner described, does remain essentially a permanent part of the substrate system, providing mechanical and chemical characteristics essentially compatible with the substrate itself, resistant to creasing, wrinkling, cracking, tearing, shrinking or creeping in a manner to great advantage over paper, vinyl and other labels of the prior art. In order that the invention may be more readily understood, reference will now be made to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a perspective view greatly enlarged of a label in a substrate and label combination embodying the invention and Figs. 2 and 3 are elevational views respectively of a prior art substrate and label combination and the substrate and label combination embodying the invention, with the substrate being a container. In the drawings there is shown a label material consisting of a polyethylene film 10 with a thickness between 0.5 and 5 mils .0127 .127mm and which has an upper surface 11 with printing thereon. It should be understood that the printing may be on either side. The polyethylene, which is low to medium density, should have a Rockwell hardness on the D scale between 40 and 60 and a tensile strength between 1000 and 3500 psi 68.64x10⁵ and 241.23x10⁵Pa, or 70 and 246 kg sq.cm , while the density should range between .91 and .94 g cm³. The surfaces of the polyethylene film should be corona treated or otherwise modified to enhance the ability of the film to receive adhesive and printing. In processing, it is preferred that indirect coating type process be used wherein the backing paper or sheet 14 be coated with a pressure sensitive adhesive in the general process as disclosed in Sackoff et al patent U.S. Patent No. 4,151,319 dated April 24, 1979. Essentially the kraft paper or other supportive sheet is coated with a suitable release material, such as, a silicone, or one of the other conventional materials used for this purpose. Thereafter, the coated sheet is passed through a curing oven which utilizes a conventional curing means, such as, heat, etc., to appropriately cure or set the release material. This produces a release surface on the release sheet. The release sheet is then coated with a modified pressure sensitive adhesive using a knife coater, for example. Other methods in addition to knife coating include, for example, spraying, roller coating, gravure roll coating, and the like. After application of the pressure sensitive adhesive, the coated release sheet is cured. Typically the pressure sensitive adhesive layer has a thickness in the range from about 0.00254 to 0.0508 mm 0.1 to 2 mils . Generally, it is coated in an amount based on the dry solids weight, of from about 0.5 to 3.0 mg cm². Thereafter the thus coated and cured sheet is married to an appropriate decorative or protective facing layer unrolled from roll. The two layers may be married by passing through nip rolls in a manner well known in the art. Alternately, in processing, the polyethylene is coated directly with a pressure sensitive adhesive, that is an adhesive that remains tacky in its normal form. The pressure sensitive adhesive 12 in the preferred form may be selected from a well known class of acrylic adhesive materials generally available in the art. Examples of polymer types used generally in the adhesive application areas and commonly employed in formulating pressure sensitive compounds are elastomers such as natural rubber or synthetic rubbers containing polymers or copolymers of styrene, butadiene, acrylonitrile, isoprene and isobutylene, thermoplastic polymers or copolymers of vinyl acetate, vinyl ethers, vinyl chloride, ethylene, propylene, acrylamide and thermoset and special polymeric materials such as polyamide, polyurethane, polyester, silicones and the like. Such compounds and their formulations are known to the art and the range and versatility of structures and properties is discussed, for example, by Martin, Subsequent to the application of the pressure sensitive adhesive layer 12, either the polyethylene label or the backing sheet, depending on which process is used, may be subjected as necessary to a drying or curing step, such as by heating. If a backing sheet is used the polyethylene film 10 and the backing paper 14 will be married together. The film may be suitably die cut as suggested by U. S. Patent Nos. 3,501,365 and 4,060,168 so that a plurality of labels will lie in spaced relationship on the backing sheet 14. Thus it is found in a preferred form of the invention that certain acrylic based adhesives have favorable properties of clarity, adhesion and cohesive strength, give the performance necessary to joining the film and substrate surfaces in a manner that there is intimate and essentially permanent contact and a result of sufficiently identical deformation and recovery movement to make the label essentially an extension of the substrate surface. The properties of the adhesive are critical to successful functioning of the label system. The adhesive must form bonds with both the polyethylene film and with the surface of the substrate that are greater than the elastic forces of the film, i.e. than the forces required for deformation and recovery of the film itself, such forces being greater than a minimum of 140 g cm². Further, and most importantly, the adhesive must have high cohesive strength, but also be capable of elastic behaviour able to deform with both the film and substrate, but able to maintain the integrity of the system, without rupture during mechanical stress. Adhesives suitable to the invention are commonly available within the art. Broadly these are adhesives having the ability to cure a high level of adhesion and cohesive strength. Such adhesives in a preferred form are copolymers of acrylic acid esters, as for example 2 ethylhexyl acrylate, with polar co monomers such as acrylic acid. Such adhesives are well known and common to the art, and are disclosed in While performance of the adhesive is basic to the utility of this invention, composition or chemical identification of that adhesive is not considered germane to the invention except as they generally affect the gross result of adhesion, elastic or flex behavior, clarity, shelf life and the like. Products of that nature and compositions suitable to the application are several and diverse and may be arrived at in a variety of methods and formulations by one skilled in the art. Thus, the objective of this invention is to define the practical requirements of adhesive systems suitable to the application. Although it is further an object of the invention to define one or more examples of adhesives suitable to the utility of the invention, it should be understood that other examples, of diverse formula and composition, can function as well, and that the invention is not limited to or by the example of adhesive used herein. As demonstrated by the examples of Table II and Table III, the bonding properties of acrylic based adhesives useful to the invention vary markedly with the nature of the film and of the substrate to which it is bonded. Both 2 mil .05mm medium density polyethylene MDPE and 3 mil .07mm low density polyethylene LPDE films, corona treated and coated with 0.5 to 1.0 mil .0127 to .025mm of a commercial acrylic base adhesive, show essentially identical peel strength values on corresponding test substrates, indicating that the bond to the treated film surface and the cohesive strength of the adhesive is stronger than the bonds with any of the substrates, and that the thickness of the polyethylene film has no effect on the peel strength values. Although the peel strength values change significantly with the nature of the substrate, with the bond to PVC rigid being almost two times the values observed in the tests using glass and steel surfaces, these differences become much smaller with time as the acrylic adhesive continues to cure and the values of tests on glass and steel approach the peel strength of the film bonded to the PVC surface which appears to reach nearly optimum values within 24 hours. It is assumed that the larger peel strength value for PVC substrates is due to chemical interaction of the adhesive system with the PVC. Comparison within the experimental set for the 4 mil .10mm PVC film, coated with the same adhesive as the polyethylene film, indicated that there is a decided disadvantage of such a deformable label system using the highly plasticized PVC film. In this case, peel adhesion values using the rigid PVC surface are more than two times higher than adhesion values of tests using steel and glass surfaces. While the values for vinyl film bonded to steel and glass are slightly more 20 than corresponding values for the polyethylene films after 24 hours, those differences increase after seven days aging, indicating an increasing influence of plasticizer migration from the film to the adhesive. Even greater indication of that plasticizer migration is the very large 24 hour peel adhesion value for the vinyl film to vinyl surface examples, along with the complete failure of that system in the seven day test where the adhesive remains with the substrate test surface in both samples tested. Similar failure, although less complete, was demonstrated in both seven day test samples of PVC film bonded to steel. Such migration of plasticizer and other additives from flexible PVC films is well documented and recognized as a major problem area in this type of product, manifesting itself as loss in adhesion, color buildup, shrinkage, loss in flexibility and ultimately in wrinkling, cracking and visual deterioration of the label system. All of these problems common to vinyl are demonstrated in the data of Table I, wherein accelerated aging tests for experimental systems II, III, IV and V of this invention are shown in comparison with commercial flexible vinyl label materials. The LDPE and MDPE samples are quite stable under the conditions of the test, whereas the vinyl samples show the rapid deterioration common to, and expected of highly plasticized vinyl films. Previously, it was considered by those skilled in the art, that polyethylene homopolymer films were unsuitable for pressure sensitive labels in flexible applications such as bottles for health care or food products. Indeed products such as that of Example I, below, using a 4 mil .10mm film of HDPE may be made into a pressure sensitive label and successfully applied to flexible substrates, but these are not deformable in the sense of this invention as It is shown in Example I, these separate from the adhered surface upon flexing of the system as in squeezing of a bottle. However, it is an object of this invention to show that stable and useful flexible label systems can be made using polyethylene film, if certain gross requirements of film dimension and physical property combinations are maintained along with coincidental requirements of film surface treatment and adhesive performance. Thus, while the invention includes the use of low and medium density polyethylene, and film thicknesses of 0.5 to 5 mils .0127 to .127mm , it is essential to point out that the density of the polyethylene must be matched with the thickness of the film in order to conform with the invention and to provide the utility defined herein. More specifically, it is the objective of this invention to describe a deformable substrate provided with a flexible and deformable label wherein the polyethylene film is limited to a definite set of products that are defined by a combination of the density of the polyethylene used and the thickness of the film itself. While the density of polyethylene useful in the application broadly includes the low and medium density grades of polyethylene commercially available, and proceeds from about 0.91 g cm³ 25 C to about 0.94 g cm³ 25 C in density, and the thickness of films useful in the application proceeds from about 0.5 mil .0127mm to about 5 mil .127mm in average cross section, not all combinations of density and thickness therein are useful to the application or valid to this invention. Thus, a film of LDPE with density as low as 0.91 g cm³ being soft and with low tensile strength between 1000 and 2500 psi 68.64x10⁵ and 171.61x10⁵ Pa, or 70 and 175 kg cm² may not be useful in the invention over the whole thickness range from 0.5mil .0127mm to 5 mil .127 mm , i.e. it may not be useful if less than about 2 mil .05mm in thickness, but would be useful if it has a thickness of above 2 mil .05mm to about 5 mils .127mm . Also, a film made of medium density polyethylene MDPE with a density as high as 0.94g cm³, being more rigid and having a high tensile strength between 2500 and 3500 psi 171.61x10⁵ and 241.23x10⁵ Pa, or 175 and 246 kg cm² may not be useful in the deformable label application at thicknesses greater than about 3 mil .076mm but can be used downward to the thickness of about 0.5 mil .0127mm in the application. It may be implied from the discussion above that when film density and thickness is considered throughout the range of utility there is an area of overlap which would comprise the area of greatest utility. That area, being the range of 0.5 to 3 mil .0127 to .076mm in the film thickness and 0.925 g cm³ in density of the polyethylene, represents the preferred form of this invention. The examples below are given to illustrate the utility and scope of the invention. A pressure sensitive label I was constructed of a 4 mil .1mm film of white HDPE, corona treated on both sides to enhance acceptability of ink and adhesive resins. The film was coated in the manner of the art with 0.5 to 1.0 mil .0127 to .025mm of an acrylic based adhesive in conjunction with a 22.675 Kg fifty pound kraft paper release liner or backing paper 14, the adhesive being a self crosslinking pressure sensitive solvent system, National Adhesives Duro Tak 80 1054, or an equivalent , with peel strength of about 50 oz. 1417 grams Pressure Sensitive Tape Council Test Method I and high cohesive strength with a hold of minimum 24 hours at 2 psi 16g cm² loading by Test Method PSTC 7. In printing and label dispensing tests, System 1 accepted solvent based printing well and was applied to flexible containers with conventional automatic labeling equipment. Squeeze testing of the labeled bottles confirmed that System 1 does not meet deformable requirements of application due to wrinkling and lifting when the substrate and label system is flexed. A pressure sensitive label II , was constructed as in the previous example, but using a 3 mil .076mm film of white LDPE. Testing of the label system for printing and label dispensing showed good acceptance of ink and successful labeling of cylindrical 16 oz. .47 I HDPE bottles to a rate of 300 per minute on automatic equipment and 90 labels per minute on semi automatic equipment. The labeled bottles showed excellent resistance to wrinkling, creasing, or other damage due to deformation of the label and substrate. A pressure sensitive label III , was constructed as in Example I, but using 2 mil .05mm thick film of clear MDPE. Printability, label dispensing and flex tests gave results similar to Example II. A pressure sensitive label IV , was contructed as in Example I, but using 2 mil .05mm thick film of white MDPE. Printing and flex tests gave results similar to II and III. A pressure sensitive label V , was constructed as in Example I, but using a 3 mil .076mm film of silver metallized LDPE. Printing and flex tests gave results similar to II, III and IV. A pressure sensitive label, as in Example II was constructed of the same 3 mil .076 mm , low density polyethylene film and National 80 1054 adhesive components, but differs in that no backing paper or release liner was used, and the adhesive was applied directly to the one side of the film with a roller system to a thickness of about 0.5 mil .0127 mm using a roller bar system. Within 2 minutes time of coating with adhesive, and without additional heating or forced air drying, the labels were applied directly to 16 oz. .47 I LDPE and PVC bottles. After storage for 24 hours the bottles were tested by squeeze and flex tests. Results were similar to Examples II, III, IV and V in that the labels do not lift, wrinkle, crease or otherwise suffer permanent damage even in severe squeezing and flexing conditions. In a separate experiment to compare the utility of emulsion solution types of pressure sentive adhesives in the application, a 3 mil .0766 mm film of white LDPE, corona treated on one side, was cut to 2.54 cm x 15.24 cm 1 in. x 6 in. strips and coated with 0.5 to 1 mil .0127 to .025 mm of the adhesive as indicated in the table below. Samples were dried for the given time and applied to the surface of a 2.957 x 10 ⁵m³ 16 oz. cylindrical HDPE bottle. The samples were tested instantly and at 24 hours intervals to compare adhesion and the ability to resist wrinkling and separation as the bottles are squeezed and deformed. Results are qualitative and relative to National 80 1054 as control. Adhesion was measured qualitatively be hand. Deformation was measured by depressing the surface of the containers with thumb pressure to cause a V shape crease in the container and label. A good rating indicates no separation as the apex of the V passes through the label. A clear film of 0.0762 mm 3 mil LDPE, corona treated and printed on the one side with both a white vinyl based ink and a black polyamide ink, was coated on the same side with the printing with 0.5 mil .0127 mm of National 80 1045 adhesive, dried with hot air and applied to the surface of a clear 4 oz. .23 I LDPE Boston Round bottle. The label so constructed was to have excellent initial tack and adhesion, but could be removed and repositioned on the bottle without damage to the label. After curing for a period of 18 hours the adhesion increased such that the label could not be removed from the surface of the bottle without permanent damage to the label. The label did not wrinkle, separate or become otherwise damaged when the bottle was squeezed, deformed by twisting, or when the outer surface of the label was wiped with methyl ethyl ketone MEK , or iso propyl alcohol solvents.
