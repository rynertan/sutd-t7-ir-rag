# Electrochemical sensor for analysis of analytes in liquids.

## Abstract
Sensors for the analysis of analytes in liquids are known. Conventionally many such sensors require an external reference cell. The invention provides an electrochemical sensor with a built in reference. In particular, a sensor of the invention includes a pair of electrodes 95a, 95b the first electrode being electrically connected to a permeable layer 91a containing a given concentration of the species to be measured, and the second electrode being electrically connected to a permeable layer 91b which is either free from species, or contains an amount thereof different from that in the first layer, the second layer being accessible in use of the sensor to the liquid sample under assay. The invention also provides an array of sensors for simultaneous analysis of a multiplicity of analytes in a liquid sample, at least one sensor in the array being as defined above.
