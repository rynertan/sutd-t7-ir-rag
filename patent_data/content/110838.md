## Description
ANTIStID ASSEMBLY FOR MOTOR VEHICLE TYRESThe invention relates to a mountable structure to be fitted to the driving vheels of motor vehicles in order to prevent them from skidding on snowy or icy roads more precisely, it revers to a structure which is easy to fix to the tyres and which provides a dependable and effective antiskid action in the most severe weather conditions of roads during the winter season.There exist already fixtures meant to keep the grip between tyres and road, in case of snowy or icy roads among such fixtures are chains, spikes fitted in the tyre tread and stiff structures consisting of frames with bent parts or sections, capable of following the tyre profile so as to constitute a gripping means on snow or ice.The main disadvantages of the chains are the following it is difficult to put them on and off the driving tyres, and especially to hook the chain on the inner side of the wheel they require uncomfortable handling which quite often cannot be perfectly carried out and if this happens, both the chain and the tyre can abnormally wear out in case the chain should break apart, although not completely, driving could become very dangerous unless the chain itself is not replaced or repaired very quickly.In the case of spikes, the main disadvantage is that they cannot be fitted by the driver, but the job must be carried out in a specialized shop.The known frames have the disadvantage to be made of stiff structures which, during the use, make the travel particularly uncomfortable because of the jerks and vibrations transmitted to the vehicle this is mainly due to the fact that during the motion the tyre modifies its shape owing to the weight and centrifugal forces that put it under strain on areas which vary continually in time, whereas the surrounding frame undergoes no deformation the difference between the dynamical behaviour of the two components tyre frame, which work very closely to move the vehicle forward, causes a jolting motion that is uncomfortable for the passengers as well as dangerous for the vehicle structure itself.The main purpose of this invention is to overcome these problems though a structure that works together with the tyre in order to move the vehicle forward on icy or snowy roads, undergoing during operation the same distortions experienced by the tyre on which it is mounted.Another purpose of this invention is to provide a structure of the type above described, which can be fitted very quickly onto the tyre in all road conditions and without special skill by the driver.Another purpose of this invention is to provide a structure of the type above described, on which the deteriorated or worn parts can be easily replaced.A last, but not less important purpose of this invention is to provide a structure of the type above described, that is better suitable than the known ones for the use for which it is meant, being the result of a technology aimed at providing cost saving components and a correct sizing of the parts composing the said structure, so that the same can withstand wear as long as possible.These and other advantages are achieved with this invention, which is characterized by the contents of the claims other purposes, features and advantages of the invention will be outlined, by referring to the accompanying drawings, which show two preferable but non restrictive manufacturing methods of the present invention. Fig. 1 is a general view of the invention, to illus strate all its details Fig. 2 illustrates the fitting method of a single component of the invention Fig. 3 illustrates a constructive alternative of the invention on Fig. 4 illustrates construction details of the struc ture shown in Pig. 2.Referring to drawing 1, we note that the invention is composed by a ring 1, which is stiff and suitable for being placed concentrically to the wheel hub of the vehicle on the said ring 1 six guide members 3 are fixed, projecting radially from the said ring 1 each of the said members 3 presents an inner prismatic recess 4 suitable for housing the prismatic end 5 of Åa lug 6, so that the same can slide inside it along the common axes.The said ring 1 is also fitted with six honks 7, each of them projecting upwards from the said ring 1 and being generally arranged on the midplane 2 of the said guide member 3.Each lug 6 is provided with a fastening means 8 for the end 9 of a spring 10, whose second end 11 is linked to a ring 12 suitable for being attached to the hook 7, with the purpose of keeping together the invention on a tyre13. Each spring 10 is provided with a tailpiece Ila, made up by the same spring wire, which, starting from the said second end 11, runs for the whole length of the spring10, outside the spring itself, and also for a longer portion lib the said piece 11a has a bent portion 11c and a lower portion lid which faces the inside of the spring when the spring is unloaded and enters the spring coils when the spring is stretched the length of portion lib has been chosen in such a way as to prevent overstretching of the spring 10 under the action of centrifugal forces during the vehicle motion or under the action of muscular strength when the structure is being mounted on the tyre 3, in order to prevent the ends 5 of the said lugs 6 from slipping out of the relevant guides 4.Each lug 6 is provided with a section 14 capable of folloving the contour of the tyre 13 during operation the said section 14 is also provided with an end 15 which, during operation, wraps the side of the tyre 13 facing the inside of the vehicle, by following the tyre contour.Finally, the said section 14 is provided with an outer bead, whose length is practically equal to the tread 18 of the tyre 13 such bead has two sharpened edges 17a and 17b, meant to cut the ice or provide more bite on the snow.Fig. 2 illustrates the mounting of the lug 6 on the tyre 13, once all other lugs have been mounted. This drawing y shows that the end 5 of lug 6 is already partially inserted into the recess 4 of the guide member 3. Sliding of the lug 6 into its housing can bereasily achieved by hand, until its section 14 hits the tread 18. On the contrary, to hook the ring 12 of spring 10 onto the hook 7, and thus to make spring 10 accomplish its task of elastically connecting its lugs 6 to the ring 1, it is necessary to make use of a fork type tool 19. The said tool 19 is constituted by a metal section, suitably sized to withstand the efforts required during the assembly and disassembly operations of the present structure, which will be explained later on the tool is provided with a semicircular bend 20 and a flexed section 21 dividing the tool 19 in two parts, the first one comprising the said semi circular bend 20 and the second comprising the open ends 19a and 19b of the said tool 19 the said flexed section 21 having the purpose during the use to prevent the ring 12 from passing from the side where it should be to the opposite side of the tool 19.Fig. 3 illustrates a manufacturing modification of the invention. A central ring 1 is connected to a second round structure 22 by means of some U sections 23 Fig. 4 each section 23 is provided with two shoulders 24a and 24b, having a distance equal to the width of the end 5 of the said lug 6, so as to allow the end 5 to slide along the axis of the section 23, i.e. radially with respect to the structure.As illustrated in Fig. 4, the structure 22 is obtained by a metal section, which is provided in a section with a plane comprising the axis of symmetry of the invention with a flexed section 25, having a generally straight central part and connecting the section 23, located in mounting conditions behind the end 5, with a metal structure 26, situated in front of it. The ring like structure 22 constitutes a rotating assembly, around the axis of symmetry of the invention, of the said flexed section 25 and of the said structure 26 in such assembly there is provided a cylindrical surface 25a, originated by the rectilinear part of the flexed section 25.For each section 23, the structure 22 is provided with a slot 27, obtained in the said surface 25a such slot 27 causes the end 5 of a lug 6 to penetrate into the section 23. The structure 26 serves the purpose of preventing the lugs 6 from moving outwards, whereas side movements are limited by the shoulders 24a and 24b and inward movements are prevented by the tyre.Components which have been already described in Fig. 1, 2 are also used for the version illustrated in Fig. 3 and 4, therefore they have been marked with the same numbers obviously their desciption is not repeated.The version illustrated by the Fig. 3 and 4 may be manufactured from stamped plates and therefore it is very convenient from an economical point of view.The mounting of the present structure on a tyre is now described in detail.Referring to Fig. 2, let us imagine that the tyre 13 is stuck in the snow and that the said structure is not mounted yet. For this operation it is necessary first of all to place the ring 1 concentrically to the wheel hub and to insert the end 5 of a lug 6 into the recess 4 of a guide member 3, paying attention to position the said lug on the tyre section closest to the ground to this purpose it is necessary to remember that the sections 14 and 15 of the lug should encircle the tread 18.Then the tool 19 is to be inserted into the ring 12, by taking care that the said ring 12 is situated in the part of the said tool 19 comprised between the flexed section 21, turned outwards, and the semi circular bend 20. After having secured the said bend 20 in the hook 7, lift the tool 19 by pulling with a hand its en 19a and 19b the ring 12 slides from the flexed section 21 to the bend 20 under the lever action constituted by the tool 19 hinged on hook 7 and once there, it catches the said hook 7.After having fixed the first lug, it is advisable to mount according to the above described method the diametrically opposite lug 6a in Fig. 2 , in order to provide the structure with a certain grip stability on the tyre 1 3 thereafter the other lugs are mounted.It is to be noted that in case of very high snow, the mounting of three lugs only may enable the wheel, driven by by the engine power, to move forward sufficiently to get over a possible unevenness of the ground, in order to complete the mounting of the other lugs on a more even surface. In the case that the central ring 1 should not be exactly coaxial during mounting with the wheel hub, it could happen that the effort to fasten the ring 12 into the hook 7 would be so great as to stretch the spring 10 beyond its yield point.This is prevented by the. said tailpiece gila, that restricts the stretching of the said spring 10 to the distance lid the extension of the spring 10 stops in fact when the bent section lid of the said tailpiece hits the first turn of the spring 10 on the side of end 9, thus telling the user that it is advisable to correct the mounting of the said structure on the tyre 13.The demounting of the structure from the tyre 13 is carried out by using the tool 19 in the opposite way, that is by inserting its ends 19a and 19b between the ring 12 and the central ring 1, taking care that the flexed section 21 is looking outwards after having so inserted the tool 19, this is lowered against the edge of ring 1 and the ring 12 is extracted from the hook 7 then it is advisable to lower the toal 19 so that the ring 12 can reach the flexed section 21 under the action of the spring 10 the end 5 of the lug is then extracted from the relevant recess 4 and one should proceed similarly with the remaining five lugs. It is to be noted that the quickness of assembling and disassembling procedures of the said structure is particularly useful when driving on roads where the snow or ice covering is limited to short stretches, which however would be absolutely insuperable for a vehicle not suitably equipped.It is also to be noted that the present structure conforms to the tyre distortions during the motion in fact the ends 5 of the lugs 6 can slide in their guides 4 and 23 according to the tyre radial direction, with controlled movements which are restricted outwards by the springs 10 fitted with the said tailpieces lia and inwards by the tread 18 of the tyre 13, to which the lugs remain steadily in contact thus avoiding those jerks wearing out the tyres and the vehicle axles. These are only two possible constructive versions of the invention, which may be subject to modifications not af fecting its essence in particular the number of lugs may be changed in compliance with the tyre size, as the number of six lugs is by no means restrictive. In another constructive configuration, the hollow sections may be locate on the end 5 of the lugs to house members projecting radia ly from the ring 1 finally the springs 10 may be secured to the said ring 1 and be detachable on the said lugs 6.Shapes, dimensions and used materials do not restrict the scope of the present invention, in which each component may be replaced by another equivalent part.
