# SPECTACLES AND MEANS FOR RETAINING SAME IN USE

## Abstract
A pair of spectacles has a frame which includes a lens retaining part 1 and side arms 2 which are hinged at 3 to the part 1. Moulded on the arms 2 are ear pieces 5. Adhesively secured on the ear pieces 5 are layers of friction material 6 which are perspiration absorbent and contact the head of the wearer to prevent the frames slipping down the nose. The layers 6 may be of fabric material or chammy leather and may have a perspiration absorbent backing pad to provide a cushioning effect on the wearer. If required, the layer 6 can be located in a recess moulded into the ear pieces 5. Desirably a waterproof layer is provided between the adhesive and the friction material.
