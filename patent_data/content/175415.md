# Method and device for agricultural crop spraying.

## Abstract
A method and device for spraying agricultural crops where a liquid, for example a fungi insecticide, growth regulating subs tance or fertilizer, is atomized in a conical or flat spray plane 24 , wherein the spray mantle 24 is partially interrupted so obtaining an asymmetrical spray picture whereby an accurate and even concentration can be achieved, said device being provided with an atomizing body 9 rotatable around a stationary part 1 formed as a hollow cylinder, whereby a groove 14 connecting with the cylinder space 3 is formed in the surface of the cylinder 1 over a circumferential portion, onto which ducts 12, 13 are arranged in the rotating atomizing body 9 in each case connect resulting in that a very even cone mantle with a vertical angle of 150 can be achieved so that the atomized liquid strikes the field produce on the underside of the leaves.
