## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to non woven articles comprised of thermotropic liquid crystal polymer fibers. Various conventional non woven articles comprised of polymeric materials have been employed for many purposes. For example, non woven articles have been employed as filters, electrical insulation and reinforcement for resins. However, such non woven articles have frequently been found to not be appropriate for use in a high temperature environment e.g., in excess of about 2000C. or in an environment where the structure will come into contact with solvents or corrosive chemicals. It is therefore desirable to provide non woven articles comprised of a polymeric material which is resistant to solvents or corrosive chemicals and also suitable for use at high temperatures. It is known to those skilled in the art that fibers comprised of lyotropic liquid crystal polymers have been employed in the production of non woven scrim sheets in conjunction with polyester fibers which are not capable of forming an anisotropic melt phase wherein the polyester fibers are thermally bonded to the lyotropic liquid crystal polymer fibers. It is also known to those skilled in the art that the heat treatment of shaped articles of liquid crystal polymers increases the melting temperature, molecular weight and mechanical properties of the polymer. See, for example, U.S. PatentNos. 3,975,487 4,183,895 and 4,247,514. OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide non woven articles which are resistant to thermal degradation. It is also an object of the present invention to provide non woven articles which are resistant to solvent and chemical degradation. It is further an object of the present invention to provide non woven articles which exhibit desirable multidimensional tensile strength and modulus. In accordance with one aspect of the present inventio there is thus provided a non woven article which exhibits desirable thermal stability and chemical and solvent resistance comprised of fibers of a polymer which is capable of forming an anisotropic melt phase, said fibers being bonded tagether.to an extent sufficient to impart structural integrity to said article. In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is thus provided a method for forming a non woven article in the form of a web or sheet which exhibits desirable thermal stability and chemical and solvent resistance comprised of fibers of a polymer which is capable of forming an anisotropic melt phase, said method comprising spray spinning said polymer in the melt phase to form a multitude of discontinuous fibers and collecting said fibers in the form of a web or sheet. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Thermotropic liquid crystal polymers are polymers which are liquid crystalline i.e., anisotropic in the melt phase.These polymers have been described by various terms, including liquid crystalline, liquid crystal and anisotropic. Briefly, the polymers of this class are thought to involve a parallel ordering of the molecular chains. The state wherein the molecules are so ordered is often referred to either as the liquid crystal state or the nematic phase of the liquid crystalline material. These polymers are prepared from monomers which are generally long, flat and fairly rigid along the long axis of the molecule and commonly have chain extending linkages that are either coaxial or parallel. Such polymers readily form liquid crystals i.e., exhibit anisotropic properties in the melt phase. Such properties may be confirmed by conventional polarized light techniques whereby crossed polarizers are utilized. More specifically, the anisotropic melt phase may be confirmed by the use of a Leitz polarizing microscope at a magnification of 40X with the sample on a Leitz hot stage and under nitrogen atmosphere. The polymer is optically anisotropic i.e., it transmits light when examined between crossed polarizers. Polarized light is transmitted when the sample is optically anisotropic even in the static state. Those thermotropic liquid crystal polymers suitable for use in the present invention include but are not limited to wholly aromatic polyesters, aromatic aliphatic polyesters, aromatic polyazomethines, wholly and non wholly aromatic polyCesteramide s and aromatic polyester carbonates. The wholly aromatic thermotropic liquid crystal polymers are comprised of moieties which contribute at least one aromatic ring to the polymer backbone and which enable the polymer to exhibit anisotropic properties in the melt phase. Such moieties include but are not limited to aromatic diols, aromatic amines, aromatic diacids and aromatic hydroxy acids. Moieties which may be present in the thermotropic liquid crystal polymers employed in the present invention wholly aromatic or non wholly aromatic include but are not limited to the following EMI4.1 EMI5.1 Preferably, the thermotropic liquid crystal polymers which are employed comprise not less than about 10 mole percent of recurring units which include a naphthalene moiety. Preferred naphthalene moieties include 6 oxy 2 naphthoyl, 2,6 dioxynaphthalene, and 2,6 dicarboxynaphthalene.

The disclosures of all of the aboveidentified commonly assigned U.S. patents and applications are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. The wholly aromatic polymers disclosed therein typically are capable of forming an anisotropic melt phase at a temperature bolow approxi mately 4000C., and preferably below approximately 35O0C. The wholly atomatic polymers including wholly aromatic polyesters and poly ester amide s which are suitable for use in the present invention may be formed by a variety of ester forming techniques whereby organic monomer compounds possessing functional groups which, upon condensation, form the requisite recurring moieties are reacted. For instance, the functional groups of the organic monomer compounds may be carboxylic acid groups, hydroxyl groups, ester groups, acyloxy groups, acid halides, amine groups, etc. The organic monomer compounds may be reacted in the absence of a heat exchange fluid via a melt acidolysis procedure. They, accordingly, may be heated initially to form a melt solution of the reactants with the reaction continuing as the polymer particles are suspended therein.A vacuum may be applied to facilitate removal of volatiles formed during the final stage of the condensation e.g., acetic acid or water . Commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 4,083,829, entitled Melt Processable Thermotropic Wholly Aromatic Polyester, describes a slurry polymerization process which may be employed to form the wholly aromatic polyesters which are preferred for use in the present invention. According to such a process, the solid product is suspended in a heat exchange medium. The disclosure of this patent has previously been incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. When employing either the melt acidolysis procedure or the slurry procedure of U.S. Patent No. 4,083,829, the organic monomer reactants from which the wholly aromatic polyesters are derived may be initially provided in a modified form whereby the usual hydroxy groups of such monomers are esterified i e., they are provided as lower acyl esters . The lower acyl groups preferably have from about two to about four carbon atoms. Preferably, the acetate esters of organic monomer reactants are provided. Representative catalysts which optionally may be employed in either the melt acidolysis procedure or in the slurry procedure of U.S. Patent No. 4,083,829 include dialkyl tin oxide e.g., dibutyl tin oxide , diaryl tin oxide, titanium dioxide, antimony trioxide, alkoxy titanium silicates, titanium alkoxides, alkali and alkaline earth metal salts of carboxylic acids e.g., zinc acetate , the gaseous acid catalysts such as Lewis acids e.g., BF3 , hydrogen halides e.g., HCl r etc. The quantity of catalyst utilized typically is about 0.001 to 1 percent by weight based upon the total monomer weight, and most commonly about 0.01 to 0.2 percent by weight. The wholly aromatic polymers suitable for use in the present invention tend to be substantially insoluble in common solvents and accordingly are not susceptible to solution processing. As discussed previously, they can be readily processed by common melt processing techniques. Most suitable wholly aromatic polymers are soluble in pentafluorophenol to a limited degree. The wholly aromatic polyesters which are preferred for use in the present invention commonly exhibit a weight average molecular weight of about 2,000 to 200,000, and preferably about 10,000 to 50,000, and most preferably about 20,000 to 25,000.The wholly aromatic poly ester amide s which are preferred commonly exhibit a molecular weight of about 5000 to 50,000 and preferably about 10,000 to 30,000 e.g., 15,000 to 17,000. Such molecular weight may be determined by gel permeation chromato graphy as well as by standard techniques not involving the solutioning of the polymer, e.g., by end group determination via infrared spectroscopy on compression molded films. Alternatively, light scattering techniques in a pentafluorophenol solution may be employed to determine the molecular weight. The wholly aromatic polyesters and poly ester amide s additionally commonly exhibit an inherent viscosity i.e., I.V. of at least approximately 2.0 dl. g., e.g., approximately 2.0 to 10.0 dl. g., when dissolved in a concentration of 0.1 percent by weight in pentafluorophenol at 600C. Especially preferred wholly aromatic polymers are those which are disclosed in above noted U S. Patent Nos. 4,161,470, 4,184,996, 4,219,461, 4,238,599 and 4,256,624 and ApplicationSerial No. 214,557. For the purposes of the present invention, the aromatic rings which are included in the polymer backbones of the polymer components employed in the present invention may include substitution of at least some of the hydrogen atoms present upon an aromatic ring. Such substituents include alkyl groups of up to four carbon atoms alkoxy groups having up to four carbon atoms halogens and additional aromatic rings, such as phenyl or substituted phenyl. Preferred halogens include fluorine, chlorine, and bromine. Although bromine atoms tend to be released from organic compounds at high temperatures, bromine is more stable on aromatic rings than on aliphatic chains, and therefore is suitable for inclusion as a possible substituent on the aromatic rings. The wholly aromatic polyester which is disclosed inU.S. Patent No. 4,161,470 is a melt processable wholly aromatic polyester capable of forming an anisotropic melt phase at a temperature below approximately 3500C.

The preferred dioxy aryl moietyII is EMI16.1 and the preferred dicarboxy aryl moiety III is EMI16.2 U.S. Application Serial No. 214,557, filed December 9, 1980, discloses a melt processable poly ester amide which is capable of forming an anisotropic melt phase at a temperature below approximately 400 C. The poly ester amide consists essentially of the recurring moieties I, II, III and optionallyIV wherein I isEMI16.3 o oII is C A C , where A is a divalent radical comprising at least one aromatic ring or a divalent trans cyclohexane radical III is Y Ar Z , where Ar is a divalent radical compris ing at least one aromatic ring, Y is O, NH, or NR, and Z is NH or NR, where R is an alkyl group of 1 to 6 carbon atoms or an aryl group and IV is O Ar O , where Ar is a divalent radical com prising at least one aromatic ring and wherein said poly ester amide comprises approximately 10 to 90 mole percent of moiety I, approximately 5 to 45 mole percent df moiety II, approximately 5 to 45 mole percent of moiety III, and approximately 0 to 40 mole percent of moiety IV.In addition, at least some of the hydrogen atoms present upon the rings optionally may be replaced by substitution selected from the group consisting of an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, an alkoxy group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, halogen, phenyl, substitutes phenyl, and mixtures thereof. Preferred moieties II, III and IV are set forth in bove noted U.S. Application Serial No. 214,557. The preferred dicarboxy aryl moiety II is EMI17.1 the preferred moiety III is EMI17.2 and the preferred dioxy aryl moiety IV is EMI18.1 The non woven articles of the present invention are comprised of fibers of thermotropic liquid crystal polymers and may be produced in a variety of ways. For example, a thermotro pic liquid crystal polymer may be spray spun onto a web or screen to provide a random array of polymeric fibers.In the alternative, melt spun fibers of a thermotropic liquid crystal polymer cut to appropriately short lengths can be slurried with a liquid which is a non solvent for the polymer e.g., water and subsequently filtered or wet laid onto a web or screen to provide a random i.e., multi dimensional array of fibers. The thus produced random array may then be subjected to a suitable thermal bonding or heat pressing step at a suitable temperature to bond the fibers together and impart the desired structural integrity thereto. That is, the article at a minimum will support its own weight and preferably can be pulled apart only with difficulty. In such a process the fibers are heated and pressed together for a period of time and at a pressure sufficient to at least bond the fibers together at the cross over points. Such fusion bonding does not result in any significant loss of orientation and accordingly, loss of strength since the polymer of which the fibers is comprised forms an anisotropic melt phase.Such a characteristic is in direct contrast to conventional thermoplastic polymers which do not form an anisotropic melt phase and which readily lose their orientation upon being heated to temperatures in excess of their melting temperature.This is also in contrast to lyotropic liquid crystal polymers which cannot be fusion bonded. It should be noted that if the spray spun fibers are not allowed to cool sufficiently prior to being deposited on the web, the fibers will become bonded together as they collect upon the web or screen and a formal heat pressing step will not be required. Polymers which are capable of forming an anisotropic melt phase are particularly suited for use in such a method since the polymer retains its orientation upon being spun and collected in the form of a web or sheet. The spray spun fibers can thus be thermally bonded together to form a non woven article having the desired degree of structural integrity without exhibiting a significant loss of orientation and strength as a result of being bonded together in the melt phase. The above described spray spinning and slurry filtering production processes are conventional processes for the production of non woven articles and are well within the knowledge of one skilled in the art. The fibers may also be bonded together by means of adhesives such as thermoplastic or thermosetting resins, epoxies, water soluble adhesives such as casine, guar gum, or polyacrylic acid, solvent based adhesives, and emulsion or latex based adhesives such as styrene butyl acrylic copolymer systems. The adhesives may be coated onto the web or array of thermotropic liquid crystal fibers by use of kiss rolls. In the alternative, the adhesives may be sprayed upon or deposited upon the web by known emulsion techniques for use with wet laid paper . The use of adhesives in such methods is known and will not be discussed in greater detail herein. The non woven articles of the present invention possess many advantageous characteristics due to the presence of thermotropic liquid crystal polymers therein. That is, since liquid crystal polymers are fully drawn and highly oriented as spun, the fibers which comprise the non woven articles of the present invention possess relatively high tensile strength and modulus. , ,.Accordingly, non woven articles comprised of such fibers similarly exhibit relatively high tenacity and modulus. In addition, the article exhibits such tensile strength and modulus in a multi dimensional manner due to the multidimensional orientation of the fibers within the structure. The non woven articles also benefit from other physical characteristics of thermotropic liquid crystal polymers such as resistance to chemical corrosion or solvation and high temperature stability due to the high melting temperatures of the fibers. For instance, the melting temperature of the polymer is preferably in excess of 200 C. and most preferably in excess of 4000C. Such articles thus are well suited for use as filters in high tt perature and or otherwise destructive environments which would tend to degrade conventional filters such as treatment of stack gases from electrical generating plants. The articles can also be used to filter a variety of liquids without dissolving or being subject to corrosion or other degradative chemical processes. A particularly interesting use for such non woven articles is as the matrix material in ballistics protection wearing apparrel. Due to the high tenacity and modulus exhibited by the liquid crystal polymers which comprise the non woven articles, such articles are readily adaptable to such a use. In order to take full advantage of the properties of the fibers of thermotropic liquid crystal polymers, it is preferred that the non woven article comprise at least a major portion e.g., at least about 50 percent by weight of the fibers and preferably consists essentially of such fibers. In a most preferred embodiment the article consists entirely of fibers of liquid crystal polymers. The mechanical properties of the non woven articles produced in accordance with the present invention can be improved by subjecting the articles to a heat treatment following formation thereof. The heat treatment improves the properties of the article by increasing the molecular weight of the liquid crystalline polymer which comprises the fibers present within the article and increasing the degree of crystallinity thereof while also increasing the melting temperature of the polymer. Such heat treatment can also serve to bond the fibers together. The articles may be thermally treated in an inert atmosphere e.g., nitrogen, carbon dioxide, argon, helium or alternatively, in a flowing oxygen containing atmosphere e.g., air . The use of a non oxidizing substantially moisture free atmosphere is preferred to avoid the possibility of thermal degradation. For instance, the article may be brought to a temperature approxi mately 10 to 30 centigrade degrees below the melting temperature of the liquid crystal polymer, at which temperature the fibers remain a solid object. It is preferable for the temperature of the heat treatment to be as high as possible without equaling or exceeding the melting temperature of the polymer. It is most preferable to gradually increase the tem perature of heat treatment in accordance with the increase of the melting temperature of the polymer during heat treatment. The duration of the heat treatment will commonly range from a few minutes to a number of days, e.g., from 0.5 to 200 hours, or more. Preferably, the heat treatment is conducted for a time of I to 48 hours and typically from about 5 to 30 hours. Generally, the duration of heat treatment varies depending upon the heat treatment temperature that is, a shorter treatment time is required as a higher treatment temperature is used. Thus, the duration of the heat treatment can be shortened for higher melting polymers, since higher heat treatment temperatures can be applied without melting the polymer. Preferably, the heat treatment is conducted under conditions sufficient to increase the melting temperature of the polymer at least 10 centigrade degrees. Most preferably, the melting temperature of the liquid crystal polymer is increased from between about 20 to about 50 centigrade degrees as a result of the heat treatment. The amount of increase which is obtained is dependent upon the temperature used in the heat treatment, with higher heat treatment temperatures giving greater increases. Similar advantages can also be obtained by heat treatment of the fibers prior to their incorporation into the nonwoven structure. It is, however, preferable to heat treat the structure subsequent to its formation since the thermal bonding and heat treatment steps can then be combined. It should be noted at this time that reference herein to a temperature below which a specific polymer may exhibit anisotropic properties in the melt phase is intended to refer to the temperature below which the polymer exhibits such properties prior to any heat treatment thereof. The chemical resistance of the polymer also increases with heat treatment and the solubility into pentafluorophenol, one of the rare solvents for thermotropic liquid crystal polymers, continuously decreases with increasing heat treatment time and eventually the material will not dissolve even minimally such as in amounts of 0.1 percent by weight . Accordingly, reference herein to solution characteristics of specific polymers is intended to refer to such characteristics prior to any heat treatment of the polymer. The invention is additionally illustrated in connection with the following Examples which are to be considered as illustrative of the present invention. It should be understood, however, that the invention is not limited to the specific details of the Examples. EXAMPLE 1 As spun fibers comprised of a thermotropic liquid crystal polymer consisting of 40 mole percent of a p oxybenzoyl moiety and 60 mole percent of a 6 oxy 2 naphthoyl moiety are provided having a denier per filament ranging from about 7 to 10. The fibers are chopped into microfibers ranging in length from about 1 4 to 3 8 inch in length and admixed with water to form a slurry. The slurry is well stirred to achieve a uniform dispersal of the chopped fibers in the slurry. The slurry admixture is poured into a tall Buchner filter funnel containing a disk of filter paper. The water is drained off with the aid of a vacuum leaving a random mat of chopped fibers upon the filter paper. The web is carefully removed from contact with the filter paper and dried. The dried web of fibers demonstrates weak structural integrity i.e., it barely supports its own weight and is easily pulled apart . The fibers are bound together by pressing the web between two heated plates whereupon the web is heated to approximately 275 C. The web is sandwiched between Kapton release films to prevent the web from sticking to the plates. The web subsequent to hot pressing exhibits substantial structural integrity and is pulled apart only with difficulty while also exhibiting textile like draping characteristics. EXAMPLE 2 Pellets comprised of a thermotropic liquid crystal polymer consisting of 40 mole percent of a p oxybenzoyl moiety and 60 mole percent of a 6 oxy 2 naphthoyl moiety are dried for 24 hours in a warm vacuum oven. The pellets are then introduced into the hopper of a spray spinning unit with the temperature of the polymer subsequently being raised to 3600C within the extruder section of the unit to provide a polymer melt. The melt is then spun from a 0.16 mill jet into an air attenuation section of the spray spinning unit where the melt is exposed to the air drag of three impinging unheated air jets and reduced to a fiber of about 50 denier per filament. The spun fiber is collected as a non bonded mat upon a wire screen located approximately 30 inches from the jet. Air heated to between about 200 5000C. is also employed to attenuate the melt which results in the production of a mat of fibers which are bonded together at their cross over points.This bonded mat is formed by collecting the fibers on a screen located approximately 12 to 16 inches from the jet. The principles, preferred embodiments and modes of operation of the present invention have been described in the foregoing specification. The invention which is intended to be protected herein, however, is not to be construed as limited to the particular forms disclosed, since these are to be regarded as illustrative rather than restrictive. Variations and changes may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention.
