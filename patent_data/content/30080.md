## Description
VINYLIDENE CHLORIDE COPOLYMER LATEX COMPOSITIONS This invention relates to copolymer compositions and more particularly to aqueous latex compositions comprising copolymers of vinylidene chloride and the use thereof in providing protective coatings. In the specification of our UK Patent 1 558 411 there are described aqueous latices of copolymers of i vinylidene chloride, ii vinyl chloride, iii one or more alkyl acrylates having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms in the alkyl group and or one or more alkyl methacrylates having from 2 to 12 carbon atoms in the alkyl group and iv one or more aliphatic alpha beta unsaturated carboxylic acids, the proportion of vinylidene chloride being from 65 to 90 parts by weight, the proportion of the said alkyl acrylates and or methacrylates being from 2 to 15 parts by weight and the proportion of the said carboxylic acids being from 0.2 to 8 parts by weight, per hundred parts by weight of the total vinylidene chloride and vinyl chloride. In that specification the preferred proportion of the said alkyl acrylate s and or methacrylate s was stated to be from 4 to 10 parts by weight per hundred parts by weight of total vinylidene chloride and vinyl chloride. We have now found that latices of copolymers containing a relatively higher proportion of alkyl acrylate s and or methacrylate s , while still having good protective properties give films having improved thermal stability. Furthermore, when a relatively higher proportion of alkyl acrylate s and or methacrylate s is used the proportion of vinylidene chloride may be varied over a wider range and it is not essential to include an unsaturated carboxylic acid in the copolymer the inclusion of an unsaturated carboxylic acid may, however, further improve the adhesion of films formed from the latex. Thus according to the present invention there is provided an aqueous latex comprising a copolymer of i vinylidene chloride, ii vinyl chloride, and iii one or more alkyl acrylates or alkyl methacrylates having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms in the alkyl group, characterised in that a the proportion of vinylidene chloride is from 20 to 95 parts by weight per hundred parts by weight of total vinylidene chloride and vinyl chloride, b the proportion of vinylidene chloride is not more than 75 parts by weight per hundred parts by weight of the total vinylidene chloride, vinyl chloride and the said acrylate s and or methacrylates and c the proportion cf the said alkyl acrylate s and or methacrylate s is more than 15 but less than 45 parts by weight per hundred parts by weight of total vinylidene chloride and vinyl chloride. When the copolymer also contains an aliphatic alpha beta unsaturated carboxylic acid, the proportion thereof preferably does not exceed 8 parts by weight per hundred parts by weight of total vinylidene chloride and vinyl chloride in general it is preferred that the proportion of any such acid does not exceed 5 parts by weight per hundred parts by weight of total vinylidene chloride and vinyl chloride. The proportion of vinylidene chloride is preferably not more than 70 parts by weight per hundred parts by weight of the total vinylidene chloride, vinyl chloride and the said acrylate s and or methacrylates. The proportion of vinylidene chloride is preferably from 45 to 80 especially from 50 to 75 parts by weight per hundred parts by weight of total vinylidene chloride and vinyl chloride. The proportion of the said alkyl acrylate s and or methacrylate s is preferably from 16 to 40 especially from 18 to 35 parts by weight per hundred parts by weight of total vinylidene chloride and vinyl chloride. The preferred alkyl acrylate is 2 ethylhexyl acrylate other alkyl acrylates which may be used include methyl acrylate and butyl acrylate alkyl methacrylates which may be used include methyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate and 2 ethylhexyl methacrylate. When the copolymer contains an unsaturated carboxylic acid, this is preferably acrylic acid other carboxylic acids which may be used include methacrylic acid, itaconic acid and citraconic acid. Thus the preferred copolymers are those derived from vinylidene chloride, vinyl chloride and 2 ethylhexyl acrylate and optionally acrylic acid . Minor proportions of additional co monomers may also be incorporated in the copolymers of the present invention, for example, co monomers having the function of increasing the adhesion of the latex film to specific substrates or co monomers having functional groups capable of cross linking.Thus additional co monomers may include copolymerisable vinyl monomers having, for example, sulphonate or phosphate functionality for improving adhesion or, for example, having epoxy or hydroxy functionality to allow subsequent cross linking. The copolymerisation may be carried out by well established emulsion techniques, for example, as described in UK Patent 1 558 411. In a preferred method of copolymerisation, at least a major proportion of the vinyl chloride component preferably the whole of the vinyl chloride component is present in the reaction vessel from the start of the reaction, together with a portion of the other monomer components, the remaining portions of the monomers being introduced preferably as a mixture thereof during the course of the reaction. The copolymer latex may be used directly as a surface coating composition or may be used as a component in the formulation of a surface coating composition, for example a paint composition comprising the copolymer latex together with conventional paint components, for example, pigments, thickening agents, plasticisers, coalescing solvents, defoamers, pigment dispersants, wetting aids or fungicides. The copolymer is preferably such that the minimum film forming temperature of the latex is not above 600C. For most applications the minimum film forming temperature is conveniently in the range from OOC to 50 0C, especially from 60C to 250C. A water based latex comprising one or more copolymers according to the present invention forms stable films which have good protective properties on a variety of substrates especially metallic substrates, for example steel , the films having good chemical resistance, good thermal stability, low permeability to water vapour and being compatible with most anticorrosive pigments. The invention is illustrated by the followingExamples. Unless otherwise stated all parts and percentages are by weight.EXAMPLE 1 An aqueous copolymer latex containing vinylidene chloride 56.2 vinyl chloride 25.9 2 ethylhexyl acrylate 16.0 , and acrylic acid 1.9 was prepared by copolymerisation in an autoclave at 600C, using sodium lauryl sulphate as surface active agent, ammonium persulphate as initiator and sodium metabisulphite as activator. This copolymer composition corresponds to 68.4 parts of vinylidene chloride, 19.5 parts of 2 ethylhexyl acrylate and 2.3 parts of acrylic acid per hundred parts of total vinylidene chloride and vinyl chloride . The initial charge of monomers to an autoclave consisted of vinylidene chloride 10.1 kg vinyl chloride 17.4 kg 2 ethylhexyl acrylate 1.89 kg and acrylic acid 0.09 kg . A monomer mixture consisting of vinylidene chloride 25.5 kg 2 ethylhexyl acrylate 10.2 kg and acrylic acid 1.42 kg was fed to the autoclave over a period of 5 hours, together with aqueous solutions of ammonium persulphate. sodium metabisulphite and surfactant sodium lautryl sulphate . At the end of the reaction period the unconverted monomer was vented off and vacuum was applied to reduce the residual monomer content of the latex. The monomer content was further reduced by bubbling nitrogen through the latex while the temperature was maintained at 600C. 119.1 kg of latex with a solids content of 54.8 were recovered from the autoclave. The latex had a minimum film forming temperature of 90C. The latex, when neutralised to pH 7 with ammonia solution and thickened by the addition of 0.28 Thickener LN GAF Corporation, USA was applied to a mild steel test panel using a No. 8Meyer bar. The film was dried for 24 hours at 250C relative humidity 50 a second coat was then applied in the same manner and allowed to dry for 7 days at 250C relative humidity 50 . The coated panel passed 70 in lb in the GardnerReverse Impact Tester ASTM D2794 69 and had excellent adhesion GtO rating according toGerman standard test DN 53151 . The panel was inspected after 1000 hours exposure the ASTM rating around the cross cut was 4F but the remainder of the panel was unaffected.EXAMPLE 2 An aqueous copolymer latex containing vinylidene chloride 47.6 vinyl chloride 29.3 2 ethylhexyl acrylate 21.2 and acrylic acid 1.98 was prepared by a method similar to that described in Example 1. This copolymer composition corresponds to 61.9 parts of vinylidene chloride 27.6 parts of 2 ethylhexyl acrylate and 2.5 parts of acrylic acid per hundred parts of total vinylidene chloride and vinyl chloride. 116.8 kg of latex with a solids content of 53.1 were recovered from the autoclave. The minimum film forming temperature of the latex was 1000. Coated steel panels were prepared from the latex as described in Example 1. The coated panel passed 70 in lb in the impact test and showed excellent adhesion GtO rating . The panel exposed to the salt spray test 1000 hours showed dense microblisters around the cross cut but the remainder of the panel was unaffected.EXAMPLE 3 An aqueous copolymer latex containing vinylidene chloride 42.3 vinyl chloride 33.3 2 ethylhexyl acrylate 22.4 and acrylic acid 2.0 was prepared by a method similar to that described in Example 1. This copolymer composition corresponds to 56.0 parts of vinylidene chloride 29.6 parts of 2 ethylhexyl acrylate and 2.6 parts of acrylic acid per hundred parts of total vinylidene chloride and vinyl chloride. The solids content of the latex was 53.0 and the minimum film forming temperature was 11 C. Coated steel panels were prepared from the latex as described in Example 1. The results of the impact test and the salt spray test were the same as obtained in Example 2. The thermal stability of a film prepared from the latex was assessed as follows. The pH of the latex was adjusted to 7.0 by addition of concentrated ammonia solution. The latex was then added to a 2 aqueous solution of Methocel J12 containing butyl cellosolve to give a thickened latex containing 0.5 of Methocel J12 and 5 of butyl cellosolve both based on the solids content of the latex . Films from the thickened latex were cast on clear glass plates, using an applicator with a clearance of 350 microns, and allowed to dry for 24 hours. The absorbance of the films was measured at wavelengths of 400 cm and 650 nm. The films were then heated for several days in an oven at 800C the change in absorbance at the two wavelengths was measured periodically during this period.The net absorbance at 400 nm the difference between absorbance at 400 nm and absorbance at 650 nm was used as a measure of thermal degradation. An arbitrary yellowing index was based upon the mean rate of increase with time of net absorbance over the first 72 hours per unit film thickness. i.e. a relatively high rating on this index corresponds to a relatively high rate of thermal degradation. The rating on the yellowing index of films from the latex described in this Example was 2. By way of comparison an aqueous copolymer latex was prepared by a similar method but having the following composition 75.6 parts of vinylidene chloride 6.2 parts of 2 ethylhexyl acrylate and 2.2 parts of acrylic acid per hundred parts of total vinylidene chloride and vinyl chloride.The rating of films from this latex on the yellowing index was 8.EXAMPLE 4 An aqueous copolymer latex containing vinylidene chloride 58.1 vinyl chloride 26.2 2 ethylhexyl acrylate 15.8 and containing no acrylic acid was prepared by a method similar to that described in Example 1. This copolymer composition corresponds to 68.6 parts of vinylidene chloride and 18.7 parts of 2 ethylhexyl acrylate per hundred parts of total vinylidene chloride and vinyl chloride. The solids content of the latex was 54.8 and the minimum film forming temperature was 7.5 C. Coated steel panels were prepared from the latex as described in Example 1. The coated panel passed 80 in lb in the impact test. The panel exposed to the salt spray test 1000 hours showed medium dense microblisters around the cross cut but the rest of the panel was unaffected. In the thermal stability test as described in Example 3 the rating on the yellowing index was 3.EXAMPLE 5 An aqueous copolymer latex containing vinylidene chloride 64.7 vinyl chloride 14.3 methyl methacrylate 19.0 and acrylic acid 2.0 was prepared by a method similar to that described inExample 1. This copolymer composition corresponds to 82 parts of vinylidene chloride and 24 parts of methyl methacrylate per hundred parts of total vinylidene chloride and vinyl chloride . The minimum film forming temperature of the latex was 400C. Coated steel panels were prepared from the latex as described in Example 1 except that tributyl phosphate 2 by weight based on total copolymer solids was added before casting the film. In the thermal stability test as decribed in Example 3 the rating on the yellowing test was 5.

EXAMPLE 7 Paints were prepared from each of the latices described in Examples 1, 2, 3 and 4, using a standard ttmillbase containing pigments. The standard millbase consisted of parts by weight zinc phosphate 5.7 micronised barytes 8.3 micronised red iron oxide 2.6 distilled water 2.0 premix 8.9 total millbase 27.5 The premixf component of the millbase consisted of parts by weight Foamaster NS 0.1 tsMethocel J12MS 0.2 dispersing agent 1.0 30 aqueous solution of Synperonic PE 39 70 distilled water 7.6 8.9 Foamaster , Methocel and Synperonic are trade marks After thorough dispersion the pH of the premix was adjusted to pH 8.5 to 9.0 by addition of ammonia. The paint formulation was prepared in each case by mixing 27.5 parts by weight of the millbase with the weight of the latex necessary to give in each case a paint containing 150 grams of total pigments per litre of the final paint formulation. Before incorporation in the paint the latex was stabilised by addition of Synperonic PE 39170 3 by weight on polymer content and adjusted to pH 4 with ammonia.
