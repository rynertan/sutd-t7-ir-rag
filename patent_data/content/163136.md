# Device for detecting toner density.

## Abstract
A toner density detecting device is provided with a coil 12 buried in a housing 11 and a cover member 13 provided on one end of the coil 12 to prevent the developing agent from touching the coil 12 . The cover member 13 has a front end portion A provided near the surface of the housing 11 and extending along the develop ing agent flowing direction Y and an apex portion D at the back of the front end portion A with respect to the direction Y . The apex portion D projects deeper into the developing agent than the front end portion A . An edge ℓ connecting the front end portion A and the apex portion D extends in the direction Y to cross the central axis of the coil 12 . A pair of faces extending in the direction on either side of the edge ℓ are gradually declined from the edge toward the surface of the housing 11 .
