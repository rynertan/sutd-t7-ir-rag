# Turbocharger control actuator.

## Abstract
A control actuator 50 for a turbocharger comprises a pressure responsive diaphragm 48 for controlling the opera tion of a turbocharger waste gate valve 36 to allow exhaust gas to bypass the turbine 24 in response to compressor inlet vacuum within the upper chamber 60 of the actuator 50 dur ing part load engine operation, and in response to turbine inlet pressure acting on the waste gate valve 36 against the action of the spring 77 during full load engine operation.
