# A reel for registry of a material web provided with crease lines.

## Abstract
In the processing of a material web provided with crease lines a reel is used frequently for registry. The reel comprises one or more axial rules, the distance between these being adapted to the distance between transverse crease lines of the material web. To ensure a correct engagement with the crease lines, the rules are relatively sharp which may cause damage to the material web. This is prevented in accordance with the invention in that supporting elements are provided at the end of the rules so that any material extending beyond the ends is not folded or broken. The reel moreover comprises adjust ment facilities for adapting it to varying distances between the transverse crease lines of the material web.
