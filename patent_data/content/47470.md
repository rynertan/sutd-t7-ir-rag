# Method for immunochemical measurement.

## Abstract
A method for immunochemical assay of an antigen or antibody by labelling the antigen or antibody with a specific cyanine or merocyanine dye containing a carboxy group followed by effecting an immune reaction and photochemi cal processing thereof is provided. The amount of the anti gen or antibody is measured in term of optical density of developed silver halide which is brought into contact with either the antigen antibody reaction product or the unre acted material. This immunochemical assay method gives high detec tion sensitivity in a simple operation manner.
