# OXIMETER FINGER PROBE

## Abstract
A finger probe 10 for use with an oximeter includes an upper housing 20 and a lower housing 22 pivotably hinged together at their distal ends 12 such that a human finger can be inserted into the proximal end 14 of the finger probe into a chamber 26 formed therebetween. The probe 10 contains at least one light emitter 50 and at least one light detector 38 situated within the upper and lower housings so as to allow light from the emitter 50 to pass through the finger to the detector 38. At least one emitter 50 is contained within an emitter housing 42 that is pivotably mounted to the upper housing 20 such that it conforms to the shape of the patient s finger when inserted into the chamber 26. Also, wiring 16 for the emitter 50 and detector 38 depends outwardly from the proximal end 14 of the finger probe along the finger such that the wiring can be readily taped to the finger and, thus, help retain the finger probe 10 in position on the finger.
