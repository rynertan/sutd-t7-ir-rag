## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Technical Field The invention relates to a product, of leather, textile material or a textile or leather imitation, for example a portfolio, suitcase, garment, shoe or the like, furnished ith a hook and loop type separable fastener strip to provide a closure. The invention also relates to a method and apparatus for making the product.2. Description of the Prior Art Hook and loop fastener strips are well known and are used to join two parts detachably to each other.These fastener strips consist of mating fastener tapes having hooks and loops set respectively on either tape, which on being pressed together will interlock and so form a connection. Such fastener strips are employed primarily on wearing apparel, for ample outer apparel, but are also often found on footwear and leather goods such as bags or the like. For this purpose, it is necessary to attach the tapes of the fastener strips to panels or webs. A known method is to stitch the tapes to the webs. That procedure, however, is laborious, and above all, if the webs used are thin plastic film, the stitches are apt to tear out. Commonly, tnerefore, the tapes of the fastener strip are bonded to the webs. However, in order to obtain a satisfactory bonded connection, it is necessary as a rule, to press the areas to be joined against each other for a substantial length of time. Since the panels or webs heretofore used are unyielding, upon pressing the areas to be joined against each other ordinarily in a hydraulic press of conventional type the hooks and or loops of the fastener strips are often so deformed and crushed against the tapes that satisfactory function of the fastener strip is no longer assured. The present invention avoids these disadvantages and makes possible the construction of a product furnished with hook and loop type fastener tapes, such that proper functioning of the fastener tape is ensured while preserving the requisite appearance and feel of the outer material. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a laminate product for use as a separable fastener for a product of an outer material having on the outer side, a predetermined outer appearance and texture, wnich comprises a first layer of outer material having on a first side, a predetermined appearance and texture, said material at least having compressible properties at least on the second side, and at least one strip of separable fastener material adhesively secured on a first side to the second s e of said outer material layer, said strip of fastener material having upstanding from the second side, a plurality of hooK and loop type engaging elements such tnat said fastener material and said outer material layer may be selectively and repeatedly pressed into engagement with at least one strip of complementary hook and loop type fastener material to form a closure. In a leather, textile, or imitation textile or leather product furnished with a hook and loop type fastener strip, the tapes of the fastener strip are joined to the product or a part of the product, by bonding to one side of a plastic or leather panel having no supporting function, the other side of the panel being provided with a cover layer which is preferably textured. For a plastic panel or web, a layer of compact polyvinyl chloride is provided having on the other side, a non supporting foamed structure, preferably of the same material. The cover layer may be provided with a clear or colored finish , for example of polyurethane or polymethyl methacrylate.In the manufacture of such a product furnished with a hook and loop type fastener strip, the method comprises coating only the tape of the fastener strip with a heat activatable adhesive and preferably airing it out, whereupon the adhesive coated side is placed on one side of the panel and the other side of the latter is placed on a surface heated preferably to a temperature between 700 and 180 C, whereby a uniform pressure is then exerted on the area to be joined. In a preferred embodiment the outer cover layer is plasticized polyvinyl chloride PVC having on one side an appearance and texture which complements the product of which it will form a closure such as a shoe fastening and on the other side an integral layer of closed cell foamed PVC having compressible and resilient properties, to which the hook and loop type fastener strip is attached by heat activatable polyurethane adhesive. However, it should be appreciated that other materials such as leather fabrics, imitation leather, etc. are contemplated within the scope of the invention, as long as it has one side compressiDle and preferably resilient properties to provide a soft leather, or leather like hand and attractive appearance.Also, all types of hook and loop type separable fastener members are contemplated, such as those of woven and molded construction, and even those having upstanding hooks in the form of mushroom shapes on one side. The woven fasteners are generally of nylon, but may also be of other materials such as polyester or the like. The fastener member having hooks usually has nylon monofilamentary hooks and the complementary loop type engaging elements usually include nylon multifilamentary loops or a thin or plush cut pile surface. In the case of a plastic panel or web, because the tapes of the fastener strip are connected to the web which usually has no substantial supporting function, the plastic panel or web may be such that it will yield elastically when compressed, thus preventing any deformation of the hooks and or loops of the fastener strip. Since the fastener tapes in any event in effect constitute a supporting member, it is not necessary that the plastic panels or webs to which the said tapes are connected should perform such a supporting function as well. This, however , has not been heretofore realized on the contrary, the accepted opinion in the art has been that the fastener tapes must be connected to a part which performs a supporting function and is accordingly of appropriate solidity and strength.Since the side of the plasm o panel or web which is opposed to the side con,rt cted tc the tapes is furnished with a cover layer having an attractive appearance and feel suited to the leather or artificial leather of which the product is made, this is the side which is thus exposed to view. For plastic, the cover layer is preferably textured, exhibiting for example tne grained texture of leather, stit ses or Ahe like. It is of particular advantage if the plastic panel or web has a foamed structure, possessing the requisite compressibility and or elasticity. Thus for plastic or imitation leather, it has been found advantageous for the plastic panel or web to consist of plasticized polyvinyl chloride, compact on one side and foamed on the other, both being bonded integrally to each other. Natural leather has been found to have the requisite appearance and feel, as well as the desirable compressibility and elasticityesuch that a foam layer is not required. In this case the fastener tape is adhesively attached directly to the rear side of the leather according to the method disclosed herein. To match the cover layer to the material of the product, it may be provided with a clear or colored finish. For PVC, this finish may for example consist of polyurethane or of polymethacrylic acid methyl ester. A method is described for attaching separable fastener tapes of the hook and loop type to a panel of flexible material comprising applying adhesive capable of being activated by heat over the surface of the fastener tape having no engaging elements, positioning the adhesive coated surface of the fastener tape in contact with one side of the panel, positioning the other side of the panel against a heated surface, and applying pressure to the fastener strip so as to cause the fastener strip to become adhesively attached to the panel. In the preferred emoodiment, the method oF the invention resides essentially in applying a coat of adhesive capable of being activated by neat, and preferably allowing the adhesive to air out, whereupon the side coated with adhesive is placed on one side of the panels or webs, while their other side is placed on a surface heated preferably to a temperature between 700 and l800C. Pressure is then exerted on the area to be joined.Since the .aeat ctivatable adhesive is applied only to the tapes of the fastener strip, and heat is supplied by way of the heated panels or webs when pressed together, whereby the adhesive is activated, a secure connection between the tapes of the fastener strip and the panels or webs preferably having a foamed structure and not performing any supporting function is thus guaranteed, even if little pressure is exerted. It is expedient for the pressure to be exerted by way of a yielding surface, for example a flexible membrane, on that side of the area to be joined which is opposed to the side in contact with the heated surface.In this manner it is ensured that even if the area to beJoined is not everywhere uniform in thickness, a uniform pressure will be exerted over this area nevertheless, since the yielding membrane will accommodate itself. This avoids the possibility that owing to a local high pressure in some parts, the hooks or loops of the fastener strip will otherwise be bent out of shape or permanently deformed. It has been found particularly expedient for the adhesive be a heat activatable polyurethane adhesive, whereby an excellent connection between the tapes of the fastener strip and the panels or webs is secured. By heat activatable adhesive, it is contempiated preferably, to use an adhesive which becomes tacky on the application of heat, thereafter permitting the adhesive to cure by airing out once the connection is made. Also, other heat activÅatable adhesives which are actually cured by the application of heat are contemplated. To shorten the time required to make the connection according to the invention, a hardener may be mixer .jith tee adhesive before it is applied. In so doing, to be sure, care must be taken that the parts to be joined are heated in their correct position and are subjected to a pressure before the hardener takes effect. The apparatus according to the invention for practicing the method consists essentially of a mold composed of at least two parts, one of which is provided with a heated surface, and in the other of which parts a membrane or the like, preferably of silicone rubber, opposed to the heated surface when the mold is closed, is stretched by its marginal edge portions. Thus, first the panel or web together with the fastener strip is placed on the heated surface of the bne part, whereupon the mold is closed and the membrane or the like is pressed against the area to be connected, while, since the membrane or the like is yielding, the membrane accommodates itself to the surface, and therefore the desired compression is obtained in tne area to be connected, while undesirable deformation is prevented. According to another embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention, a die may be arranged on the heated surface, to dispose the webs and fastener strip in the desired joining position. This die, resting as it does on the heated surface, is heated likewise, so that in tr embodiment also, tne heat is tranitted to the parts to be joined. Such an einbodiment has the advar.tage at by a suitably configuration of tne die, the cover layer may at the same time be embossed by roans of the pressure exerted by way of the membrane or the like. The embossing may be in the form of a leather look, stitches, or alternate design pattern. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the heated surface forms the floor of a trough like bottom mold, and the membrane or the like is mounted in a cover covering the said bottom mold. In such an embodiment, wnen the cover is open, the parts to be joined together may be placed on the heated surface, but the membrane or the like can be securely fixed in the cover. When the mold is closed, the requisite pressure can be applied to the parts to be joined by simple means.This may be done, according to a preferred embodiment of tne invention, by providing the mold with at least one opening communicating with a vacuum system to set up a vacuum in the space between the membrane and the heated surface. By means of this vacuum, the membrane is pressed against the parts to be joined. In addition to the vacuum, or alternatively even instead of the vacuum, the membrane may be acted upon by a pressure medium. In that case, the mold is provided with at least one opening communicating with a source of pressure medium, preferably a source of compressed air, to supply pressure medium to the space bounded by the side of the membrane or the like away from the heated surface. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF TES DRAWINGS Preferred embodiments of the invention will be described hereinbelow with reference to the drawings, wherein FIG. 1 is a cross sectional view of a laminate product of the present invention and FIG. 2 is a cross sectional view of the apparatus of the present invention. BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT TE INVENTION Referring to FIG. 1 the laminate product 1 of the present invention is illustrated in cross section.Separable fastener member 2 consisting of a polyester or a polyamide material such as nylon, has base strip 4 having upstanding from one surface, a plurality of hooks 5. Te separable fastener member 2 is adhesively connected tr a layer of plasticized polyvinyl chloride web 3 having a foamed structure as shown. The connection is made by first coating the hookless side of base strip 4 with a heat activatable polyurethane adhesive, then placing the adhesive coated side of the tape 2 into contact with the foamed web of plasticized polyvinyl chloride 3, and then subjecting the area to be joined to the action of pressure and heat. On its other side, the web 3 is provided with a flexible cover material layer 6 consisting for example of a compact polyvinyl chloride. A foamed polyvinyl chloride layer 7 is positioned on the opposite side of cover layer 6 and preferably integral therewith. This cover layer forms the side of the product exposed to view, and accordingly is preferably textured, so that the outer appearance of the cover layer will match the artificial leaner, imitation leather, natural leather, fabric, or other material of which the product not shown is made and of which the laminate product forms a fastening.The main product may be any product generally made of leather, imitation leather, fabric, etc. such as a footwear, portfolio, suitcase, garment bag, bag, etc.. In this instance, the cover layer 6 is preferably provided with a clear or colored finish of polyurethane or methyl polymethacrylate to provide 2 predetermined appearance and finish for the cover material layer 6. It will be appreciated that the foamed structure 7 preferably closed cell of plasticized polyvinyl chloride web 3 provides unique compressibility and resilience which facilitates a soft hand and appearance similar to that provided by leather or heavy fabrics.These properties also facilitate maximum engagement of the hook type engaging elements 1 with upstanding loop type engaging elements of a complementary fastener strip not shown which may be attached in the same or other manner to a part of the product. The present laminate product 1, in combination with the complementary fastener, is intended to form a closure of the main product or of a portion or section of the main product. The apparatus illustrated in FIG. 2 includes mold 8 having a trough shaped bottom part 9 and a cover 10, tightly joined by suitable means to the bottom part 9 but selectively removable therefrom. In the bottom part 9, a plate 11 is arranged, in which electric heating wires 12 are embedded, so that the surface 13 of plate ll is heated. On this heated surface 13 there is a die 14, which may be specially surfaced. On this die is laid the panel or web 3, with the side showing the cover layer 6 downward. On the other side of the panel or web 3, the tape 2, previously coated with a heat activatable adhesive as noted above , is laid. The heat activatable adhesive is preferably allowed to air out before the tape 2 is placed on the panel or web 3. In the cover 10, a flexible membrane IS is so stretched such that when the cover 10 is placed on the bottom part 6, thus closing the mold, the membrane faces the tape 2 on the side of the hooks 5. In operation, the membrane 15 is subjected to pressure. For this purpose, by way of a fitting 16, communicating by way of a suitable line not shown with a vacuum system likewise not shown , a vacuum is produced in the space 17 under the plate 11. In this plate ll, at the marginal portions, are orifices 18, through which the vacuum communicates and is propagated into the chamber 19 bounded by the heated surface 13 and the membrane 15, whereby the membrane is forced against the area of connection between the tape 2 and the web 3.Before positioning the web 3 and tape 1 into position as shown the die ll is pre heated by means of the electric heating wires 12 to a temperature preferably between 700 and 18000. Tn yielding membrane 15 accommodates itself to the surface of the tape 2, so that a uniform pressure is assured over the entire area of the tape 2. This ensures a secure connection between the tape 2 and the web 3 through the action of the adhesive which is activated by the heat thus supplied. For the materials and the adhesive disclosed, the pressure is preferably maintained for about one minute.Thereafter, the cover 7 may be opened and the laminate product removed from the mold. In addition to the vacuum applied, or alternatively even in place of such vacuum, the space 19 above the membrane may communicate by way of a fitting 20 and a line not shown with a source likewise not shown of pressure medium, whereby the membrane is simultaneously subjected to pressure in the downward direction of the mold, thus forcing it against the tape 2.
