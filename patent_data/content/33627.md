# Method for reading drawings.

## Abstract
This disclosure concerns to apparatus for reading draw ings. The apparatus of this invention is an apparatus for read ing symbols on a drawing 11 wherein the drawing com prises a preprinted lattice pattern with orthogonal lines form ing unit rectangular areas and each symbol or portions thereof is drawn within one or more of the unit area. Each symbol is drawn so that the portion of the symbol within a unit area has a predetermined size and position with respect to the sides of the unit area. The apparatus includes scanning means 14 for scanning several discrete points within each unit area and producing binary data for each scanned point, storage means for storing standard pattern data, identifying means 17 , coupled to the storage means and the scanning means, for comparing the binary data with the pattern data to identify the symbol or symbol portion within the scanned unit area, the identifying means 17 producing a code representing the symbol or symbol portion when identity is established, detecting means 24, 25 for detecting the position of the scanned unit area, and drawing storage means 19 , coupled to the detecting means and the identifying means, for storing the code at an address defined by the detecting means 24, 25 , the drawing storage means 19 storing a code for each unit area scanned by the scanning means.
