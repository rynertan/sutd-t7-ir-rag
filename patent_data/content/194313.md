# METHOD OF AND APPARATUS FOR FREEZING FOOD.

## Abstract
Method of and apparatus for freezing food rapidly by immersing the same in the brine. According to the present invention, food is wrapped in a film which is non permeable to water, and the resultant food is immersed in the fluidized brine of different temperatures in sequence. The food is frozen with little difference between the temperature of its outer circumferential portion and that of its core portion as the food is immersed in the fluidized brine of different temperatures in sequence. Accordingly, no cracks occur in the food while it is frozen, and no change occurs in the quality of protein in the core portion of the food.
