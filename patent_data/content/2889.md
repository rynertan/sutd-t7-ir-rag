# A method of forming a polymer film.

## Abstract
A method of forming a polymer film containing metal therein includes the steps of providing an electrode of a metal that can be etched by a halogen, providing a substrate for the polymer film to be deposited thereon, and passing a halocarbon monomer through a plasma system so that the metal etched from the electrode forms a volatile halide and is incorporated in the polymer film that is deposited on the substrate.
