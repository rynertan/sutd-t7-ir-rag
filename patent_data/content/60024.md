## Description
ELECTRIC SOCKET TERMINAL This invention relates generally to electric socket terminals and, more particularly, to electric socket terminals which are used for connecting an electric component, such as a switch, having a plurality of contact pins in a set pattern to a number of conductors. The object of the invention is to provide a socket terminal having a socket member which accommodates manufacturing variations or tolerances in pin diameter, pin to pin location, pin angle and pin length while providing good retention and electrical connection with each pin. A feature of the invention is that the socket member has several independently sprung contacts which accommodate pin diameter and location variations. Another feature of the invention is that the socket is elongated and has relatively short contacts at the forward end for accommodating variations in pin angle and length. Another feature of the invention is that the contacts have beveled faces to provide a good lead in for pin insertion. Other objects and features of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art as the disclosure is made in the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment of the invention as illustrated in the accompanying sheets of drawings in which Figure 1 is an exploded perspective view of a switch having three contact pins in a set pattern and a printed circuit board having three electric socket terminals in accordance with this invention which are mounted thereon for receiving the three contact pins. Figure 2 is a plan view of a stamped sheet metal blank for making one of the electric socket terminals shown in Figure 1. Figure 3 is a longitudinal view of a typical one of the electric socket terminals and part of the printed circuit board in section, which are shown inFigure 1. Figure 4 is a section taken substantially along the line 4 4 of Figure 3 looking in the direction of the arrows. Figure 5 is a right end view taken from the line 5 5 of Figure 3. Figure 6 is a left end view taken from the line 6 6 of Figure 3. Figure 7 is a perspective view of the electric socket terminal shown in Figures 3 to 6. Referring now to the drawings, Figure 1 shows a printed circuit board 10 having three electric socket terminals 12 mounted thereon, in a pattern corresponding to that of three contact pins 14 projecting from a switch 16 which is to be plugged into the printed circuit board. Printed circuit boards are well known in the art and typically comprise a non conductive base 18 of phenolic or other suitable hard plastic material and a plurality of conductor strips 20 printed on a surface of the base in a predetermined arrangement to provide all or part of an electric circuit. Typically, electric socket terminals are attached to the printed circuit boards so that various electric components, such as the switch 16, can be plugged into the printed circuit board and thereby electrically connected into the circuit. The printed circuit board 10 has a more or less conventional arrangement for mounting electric socket terminals, namely a number of round holes 22 which extend through the base 18 and enlarged contact pads 24 of the conductors 20. See Figures 3, 4 and 5. The electric socket terminals 12 are identical and each is made by die forming a flat stamped blank 26 shown in Figure 2. Referring now to Figures 3 to 7, the typical electric socket terminal 12 has an elongated socket member 28 at one end for receiving one of the contact pins 14 and an attachment means 30 at the opposite end for mounting the electric socket terminal on the printed circuit board 10 and electrically connecting it to one of the conductors 20. The elongated socket member 28 is formed by bending the flat blank 26 perpendicularly at the dashed lines 32 shown in Figure 2. Bending the blank 26 so, results in a socket member 28 of square shape formed by a plurality of generally rectangular side walls 34, which are joined one to another along a longer side edge. In so forming the socket member 28, one of the side walls 34 has a seam 35 where the edges of the bent blank come together. Each side wall 34 has a cantilever spring 36 at the entrance end 38 of the socket member 28 which is provided by an L shaped slot 37 which separates a corner portion of the side wall from the remainder of the side wall. Each cantilever spring 36 thus formed, projects in a direction transverse to the longitudinal centerline of the elongated socket member 28, that is in a direction from one of the longer side edges of its associated rectangular side wall toward an opposite longer side edge. While the cantilever springs 36 are shown as flat and rectangular, other shapes, for instance flat and trapezoidal, are possible. Each of the cantilever springs 36 has a contact 40 at the free end which extends inwardly into the socket member 28 for engaging the contact pin 14 when it is inserted into the socket member 28 via the entrance end 38. The contacts 40 are provided by bending the free ends of the springs 36 perpendicularly along the dashed bent lines 39 shown in Figure 2. The contacts 40 are preferably midway between the longer side of their respective side walls 34 so that each contact 40 is radially directed to the longitudinal centerline of the socket member 28. When the socket member 28 has a square shape each contact 40 lies diametrically opposite another contact 40 and the four contacts are orthogonally related as shown in Figure 6. The contacts 40 also have beveled edges 42 at the entrance end 38 to guide the contact pin 14 into the socket member 28. The attachment means 30 is in the form of two bent tabs 44 which extend from the ends of opposite side walls 34 at an end opposite the entrance end 38 of the socket member 28. The socket terminal 12 is mounted on the circuit board 10 by snapping the tabs 44 through the hole 22, so that they wedge against the contact pad 24 to secure the socket terminal 12 and make an electrical connection with the conductor 20. The tabs 44 are then soldered to the contact pad 24 as shown in Figure 5. While the socket terminal 12 is illustrated in connection with a printed circuit board, the invention relates primarily to the socket member 28 for receiving a contact pin and, consequently, the socket terminal may be adapted for other connector systems. For instance, the socket terminal may be used in a connector body on a wiring harness simply by modifying the attachment means 30 to a conventional crimp barrel. We wish it to be understood that we do not desire to be limited to the exact details of construction shown and described, for obvious modifications will occur to a person skilled in the art.
