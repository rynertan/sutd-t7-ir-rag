# APPARATUS FOR SHIELDING AUDIO SIGNAL CIRCUIT.

## Abstract
The shielding apparatus is constituted by a shielding member 13, 21, 31, 41 or 42 which surrounds a signal conductor 11 . The shielding member has an electrically discontinuous portion 15, 24,33, 45 or 46 for the purpose of preventing formation of a closed circuit within the cross section of the signal conductor 11 . For this reason, it is possible to prevent the signal current flowing through the signal conductor 11 from inducing a secondary current in the shielding member 13, 21, 31, 41 or 42 , the secondary current adversely affecting the signal current, without im pairing the properties of the shielding member by which the signal conductor is effectively shielded against any external electromagnetic field.
