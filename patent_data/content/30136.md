## Description
REGULATED DEFLECTION CIRCUIT WITH START UP CONTROL This invention relates to regulated deflection circuits with start up and electronic circuit breaker control. Switching regulators for television receiver power supplies may conveniently provide AC power line or mains supply isolation at the input transformer of the switching regulator. For regulator switches that are synchronized with horizontal deflection, the flyback transformer may provide mains supply isolation, with the flyback transformer functioning as.the switching supply input transformer. The regulator switch is located in the non isolated section of the power supply and is coupled in series with the primary winding of the flyback transformer across the mains supply source. The horizontal deflection generator including the horizontal deflection winding is coupled to a conductively isolated secondary winding of the flyback transformer. The regulator switch is turned on at a controlled instant within the trace interval of each horizontal deflection cycle to draw input current in the flyback transformer primary winding from the mains supply. The energy stored in the flyback transformer during conduction of the regulator switch within the horizontal trace interval is transferred during retrace to secondary winding load circuits such as the horizontal deflection generator and the high voltage ultor load. Several techniques are available for turning off the regulator switch during each horizontal deflection cycle.In one technique, a transistor is used as the regulator switch. A control circuit provides a reverse bias voltage to the base of the transistor, either toward the end of the trace interval or during the retrace interval, to turn the transistor off. Such a regulator circuit has the disadvantage of requiring a relatively complex control circuit to maintain the transistor conducting during trace and to turn off the transistor without undue dissipation or damage during turn off. In another technique, a thyristor, such as a silicon controlled rectifier, is used as the regulator switch. A relatively simple control circuit turns on the thyristor within the trace interval. An LC commutating circuit is coupled to the thyristor and initiates a resonant current oscillation upon thyristor turn on. The thyristor is commutated off as the resonant current provided by the commutating circuit attempts to reverse direction in the thyristor. Such a circuit has the disadvantage of using a relatively costly inductor as part of the commutating circuit. In still another technique,using a thyristor as a regulator switch, the thyristor is commutated off within the horizontal retrace interval by applying the retrace pulse voltage developed across the horizontal deflection winding to the secondary winding of the switching supply input flyback transformer. The retrace pulse voltage applied to the secondary winding of the flyback transformer reflects a resonant current to the primary winding to cause the current in the thyristor regulator switch to decrease during retrace until the thyristor is commutated off as the current therein attempts to reverse direction. An oppositelypoled diode may be coupled in parallel with the thyristor to return to the mains supply source any remaining energy stored in the flyback transformer after the thyristor is commutated off. When using a thyristor as a regulator switch that is commutated off by a reflected retrace pulse, additional circuitry is desirable for slow start up of the regulated deflection circuit and for electronic circuit breaker operation during overload and short circuit conditions.A slow start mode of operation is desirable upon initial energization of the regulated deflection circuit because the retrace pulse voltage used to commutate off the thyristor switch is initially absent or of too low an amplitude. An electronic circuit breaker function is desirable to disable the regulator during short circuit and overload conditions when the retrace pulse voltage is absent or insufficient to properly commutate off the regulator switch thyristor. An embodiment of the invention provides slow or soft start regulator circuit operation by coupling a second controllable switch in the series path of the input current to the flyback transformer primary winding. During a first portion of the start up interval after initial energization of the deflection circuit but prior to steady state operation, the second controllable switch is turned on immediately prior to a zero crossover instant within each cycle of the supply frequency alternating polarity or mains supply voltage.The second switch turn on signals are then phase advanced from the zero crossover instant during the transition from start up to steady state power supply and deflection circuit operation to enable greater amounts of input current to flow from the AC mains supply under normal steady state deflection circuit operation. A second feature of the embodiment is a circuit which inhibits the generation of the second switch turn on signals for a predetermined interval upon initiation of the start up interval. Such an inhibit interval is desirable to prevent transient voltages generated after the initial energization of the deflection circuit from improperly turning on the second switch at instants other than near the zerocrossover instant. In a specific embodiment, the output of a flip flop having two output state voltages is applied to the control circuit of the second switch. Upon initiation of the start up interval, the flip flop develops the first output state voltage and inhibits the generation of the second switch turn on signal.After the elapse of a predetermined interval from start up initiation, the flip flop changes output states and applies the second output voltage to the second switch control circuit to enable the generation ,of the second switch turn on signal. Another feature of the embodiment is to apply a deflection rate signal to the second switch control circuit during steady state operation of the deflection circuit so as to generate the second switch turn on signal during each cycle of horizontal deflection, thereby ensuring the turn on of the second switch as soon as the main supply voltage permits forward conduction through the switch. The preferred embodiment of the invention enables the second switch to function as an electronic circuit breaker to block the flow of input current from the mains supply during deflection circuit overload or short circuit conditions. A signal representative of the amplitude of the deflection rate voltage, such as a retrace pulse voltage, used to vary the instant of turn on of the regulator switch, is sensed by the electronic circuit breaker circuit. A sharp transition occurring in the sensed signal, which indicates that an overload or short circuit condition has occurred, trips the circuit breaker. The inhibit flip flop switches back to the first output state voltage, thereby preventing the second switch turn on signal from being generated and thereby blocking the flow of input current. Still another feature of the embodiment is to precharge the trace capacitor or the DC blocking capacitor that is coupled to the deflection generator coupled flyback transformer secondary winding. The trace or DC blocking capacitor is precharged prior to the initial conduction of the regulator switch so as to enable the generation of minimum amplitude retrace pulses for commutating off the regulator switch during start up. In the drawing FIGURE 1 illustrates a regulated deflection circuit with start up and electronic circuit breaker control embodying the invention FIGURE 2 illustrates waveforms associated with the operation of the circuit of FIGURE 1 FIGURE 3 illustrates a portion of the circuit ofFIGURE 1 including detailed embodiments of the regulator, start up and electronic circuit breaker circuits FIGURE 4 illustrates the pin terminal connection of two conventional integrated circuits used when implementing the circuit of FIGURE 3 FIGURE 5 illustrates waveforms associated with the operation of the circuit of FIGURE 3 and FIGURE 6 illustrates a detailed embodiment of the low voltage power supply circuit portion of FIGURE 1. In a television receiver regulated horizontal deflection circuit 20, illustrated in FIGURE 1, a source of supply frequency alternating polarity voltage 21, such as a 220 volt AC, 50 llz, mains supply, is coupled across input terminals 22 and 23 of a full wave bridge rectifier 26. A fuse 84 and a mechanical on off switch 83 are coupled between source 21 and input terminal 23. A terminal 25 of full wave bridge rectifier 26 comprises the current return or non isolated ground terminal. An output terminal 24 of full wave bridge rectifier 26 is coupled through the anodeto cathode path of a controllable switch, SCR 27, to an end terminal 28 of the primary winding 30a of an input transformer 30. A filter capacitor 29 is coupled to end terminal 28 to develop a filtered but unregulated DC input voltage Vin at terminal 28.The other end terminal of input transformer primary winding 30a is coupled to the anode of a controllable regulator switch SCR 76. The cathode of SCR 76 is coupled to non isolated ground. Parallelly coupled withSCR 76, but oppositely poled, is a diode 77. SCR 76 and diode 77 may comprise a single semiconductor element 75 such as an integrated thyristor rectifier ITR . Input transformer 30 may comprise a horizontal output or flyback transformer with a rectangular core 130.Primary winding 30a is wound around one leg of rectangular core 130 and secondary windings 30b 30d may be wound around the opposite leg. With the windings of flyback transformer 30 so situated, a substantial leakage inductance 230, due to loose magnetic coupling, exists between primary winding 30a and each of the secondary windings 30b 30d. By concentrically winding all of the secondary windings, for example, the secondary windings are relatively tightly coupled to each other magnetically and a relatively small leakage inductance exists between any two of the secondary windings. An end terminal of flyback transformer secondary winding 30b is coupled to a horizontal deflection generator 43 at the collector of a horiozntal output transistor 49. A DC blocking capacitor 47 is coupled to the other end terminal of secondary winding 30b. Horizontal deflection generator 48 comprises the series arrangement of a horizontal deflection winding 53 and an S shaping or trace capacitor 52, a retrace capacitor 51, and a trace switch 54 comprising horizontal output transistor 49 and a damper diode 50.A conventional horizontal oscillator 55 provides a square wave switching voltage 56, repeating at the horizontal deflection frequency, to to a horizontal driver 57 for switching horizontal output transistor 49 into conduction within the horizontal trace interval of each deflection cycle and for cutting off the output transistor to initiate the horizontal retrace interval. A 15 volt DC supply voltage is applied to horizontal oscillator 55 at a terminal L and a 25 volt DC supply voltage is applied to horizontal driver 57 at a terminal M. The retrace pulse voltage Vr developed by deflection generator 48 at the collector of horizontal output transistor 49 is applied to flyback transformer secondary winding 30b, stepped up in voltage by high voltage secondary winding 30d, rectified by a diode 45 and filtered by a capacitor 46 to develop an ultor accelerating potential at a terminal U for the ultor load, not shown, of a television receiver picture tube. The retrace pulse voltage developed in flyback transformer secondary winding 30c is rectified by a diode 42 that is coupled to an end conductor lead 35 and filtered by a capacitor 43 to develop a 230 volt DC supply voltage at a terminal 44.The voltage developed across flyback transformer secondary winding 30c is rectified during the trace interval by a diode 36 that is coupled to the other end conductor lead 31 and is filtered by a capacitor 37 to develop a 25 volt DC supply voltage at a terminal 38. A rectifier 39 is coupled to a tap terminal 32 of secondary winding 30c to develop a 15 volt DC supply voltage at a terminal 41 after filtering by a capacitor 40. A tap terminal 33 is coupled to a chassis ground conductively isolated from the earth ground which is coupled to primary winding 30a. A separate mains rectified auxiliary power supply 85, comprising an auxiliary mains supply transformer 62, a bridge rectifier 63, a diode 65 and a filter capacitor 66, provides 24 volts DC at a terminal 67. The 24 volts DC is used as a start up supply, as will be explained, and also powers, for example, a high wattage audio circuit, not illustrated in FIGURE 1. During normal steady state operation of deflection circuit 20, energy is transferred from source 21 to the various load circuits coupled to the secondary windings of transformer 30 including load circuits such as the ultor load and the horizontal deflection generator 48.Regulator SCR 76 is gated into conduction at a controlled instant within the trace interval of each horizontal deflection cycle by a gating pulse 78 developed by a regulator circuit 58. The gating pulse 78 is coupled by a transformer 60 to the gate of the SCR through a capacitor 70. When SCR 76 is gated into conduction, a primary winding current i1 flows in transformer winding 30a and in SCR 76. To regulate a deflection circuit energy level, such as the retrace pulse amplitude Vr, the turn on instant of SCR 76 and, thus, its conduction time, is varied by regulator control circuit 58 in response to variations of the deflection circuit energy level as represented by the retrace pulse 79 developed at a tap terminal 34 of secondary winding 30c and applied to the regulator control circuit along a conductor line 80. Operation of regulator circuit 58 is synchronized with horizontal deflection during start up by applying to the regulator along a conductor line 81 the square wave switching voltage 56 developed by horizontal oscillator 55, and is synchronized during steady state operation by the applied retrace pulse 79. As illustrated in FIGURE 2, the turn on instant of regulator SCR 76 within the interval tla tld is varied during the horizontal trace interval under varying load and mains supply voltage conditions to produce waveforms such as waveforms 71 74 representing the current i1 flowing in primary winding 30a and ITR 75. The turn on of SCR 76 varies from the instant tla for waveform 71 to the instant tld for waveform 74. In general, the current i1 increases from the turn on instant of the SCR until the instant t3, within the retrace interval, is reached.The retrace pulse voltage Vr that is developed at the collector of horizontal output transistor 49 beginning at time t2 is applied to flyback transformer secondary winding 30b to reflect a resonating current to primary winding 30a such that the current il in winding 30a begins to decrease in a resonant manner beginning at time t3. Near the center of the horizontal retrace interval, the current il reverses direction and commutates off SCR 76. The negative current i1 is then carried by diode 77 to return energy to terminal 28.After termination of the retrace interval, the current il again flows as a positive going but negatively valued ramp until the zero current level is reached, at which time diode 77 is commutated off and the ITR becomes an open circuit. Energy is transferred by way of transformer 30 to the load circuits such as the ultor load during the horizontal retrace interval, as indicated by the peak magnitude of the positive current il near the beginning of horizontal retrace being greater than the peak magnitude of the negative current near the end of horizontal retrace.The energy transferred during horizontal retrace is stored in the leakage inductance 230 of transformer 30.Transformer 30 is designed to provide sufficient leakage inductance to store all of the required energy that is to be transferred under normal deflection circuit operation while still enabling the current il to become negative during horizontal retrace in order to commutate off SCR 76. The amount of energy stored and transferred is a function of the conduction time of SCR 76 and ITR 75. A feature of the invention is to ensure proper commutation of regulator SCR 76 during the start up interval after closure of on off switch 83 when the retrace pulse voltage Vr is absent or is of insufficient amplitude to reflect sufficient resonant current to primary winding 30a for commutation purposes. The start up circuit for deflection circuit 20 includes SCR 27 and a control circuit 59 for providing turn on gating pulses to SCR 27 by way of a transformer 61 and a capacitor 69. DC blocking capacitor 47 and trace capacitor 52 are precharged through a diode 68 from the 24 volt supply terminal 67 of auxiliary supply 85 prior to the initial conduction of regulator SCR 76. This precharging enables the immediate generation of relatively low amplitude retrace pulses Vr when horizontal oscillator 55 begins to provide the square wave switching voltage 56. The current i1 in primary winding 30a is maintained at a relatively small value in order to permit the low amplitude retrace pulse voltage Vr during start up to commutate off regulator SCR 76. To maintain a low amplitude to the current il during start up, the input voltage Vin is made to increase relatively slowly during the start up interval. SCR 27 is coupled in the series circuit path for input current from theAC mains supply 21 to primary winding 30a. Control circuit 59 initially provides gating pulses to SCR 27 immediately prior to the zero crossover instants of the alternating polarity mains supply voltage. To synchronize operation of control circuit 59 with the alternating polarity mains supply voltage, the full wave rectified mains voltage V64, repeating at twice the mains supply frequency fACt is applied to control circuit 59 from terminal 64 along a conductor line 82. By turning on SCR 27 immediately prior to the zero crossover instants of the mains supply voltage, the conduction time of SCR 27 is kept relatively short. A relatively small amount of input current flows from mains supply 21, resulting in a relatively low input voltage Vin being developed at terminal 28 and a relatively small current i1 flowing in primary winding 30a. SCR 76 can therefore be commutated off during the start up interval when the retrace pulse voltage amplitude is relatively small.Control circuit 59 then phase advances the gating of SCR 27 away from the zero crossover instants during the transition from start up to steady state operation to enable greater amounts of input current to flow and to bring the input voltage Vin to its steady state value. Another feature of the invention is to combine an electronic circuit breaker function with the start up function of SCR 27. If a transformer secondary winding coupled load, such as the ultor load, short circuits and substantially reduces the amplitude of the retrace pulse voltage Vr, or if, for example, deflection generator 48 malfunctions and fails to generate a retrace pulse voltage, regulator SCR 76 will not be commutated off. To prevent the current i1 in flyback transformer primary winding 30a from increasing to prohibitive values under a short circuited secondary load condition or a malfunctioning deflection generator condition, a retrace pulse voltage 79 is applied to control circuit 59 along conductor line 80.Control circuit 59 prevents the generation of gating pulses to SCR 27 when sensing a negative going transient produced by the collapse of retrace pulse voltage 79. The input current path to primary winding 30a from mains supply 21 is then opened up, thereby disabling normal deflection circuit operation. After normal deflection circuit operation is disabled, the start up portion of control circuit 59 again turns on SCR 27 immediately prior to the zero crossover instants of the mains supply voltage to repeat the slow start sequence. Should the fault condition persist, the disabling circuit portion of control circuit 59 will again be activated to disable deflection circuit 20. Operation of deflection circuit 20 under a persistent fault condition will cycle between start up and disabling modes of operation until fuse 84 opens and maintains the deflection circuit disabled. During the steady state operation of deflection circuit 20, control circuit 59 applies a gating pulse toSCR 27 once each horizontal deflection cycle in response to the horizontal deflection rate square wave voltage 56 applied to control circuit 59 along conductor line 81. By providing a turn on gating signal to SCR 27 each deflection cycle, conduction of the SCR is assured as soon as the anode potential of the SCR exceeds the cathode potential. FIGURE 3 illustrates a portion of the circuit ofFIGURE 1 including detailed embodiments of regulator circuit 58 and the start up and electronic circuit breaker control circuit 59. A 15 volt DC voltage at terminal L and a 6.8 voltDC voltage at a terminal N provide operating voltages for the two control circuits. Under normal, steady state deflection circuit operation, a driver transistor Q5 within regulator circuit 58 is switched on at a controlled instant within the trace interval of each deflection cycle to produce gating pulses 78 to turn on regulator SCR 76. The exact turn on instant of transistor Q5 is determined by the triggering of a comparator 90 in accordance with variations in the amplitude of retrace pulse 79 applied to regulator circuit 58 along conductor line 80. During the start up interval, after closure of on off switch 83, comparator 90 is triggered by the leading or positive going edge of the horizontal deflection rate square wave switching voltage 56 obtained from horizontal oscillator 55 and applied to input pin 5 of comparator 90 after first being differentiated. The leading edge of square wave switching voltage 56 is also used to turn off horizontal output transistor 49. Thus, during start up, the turn on of regulator SCR 76 occurs near the end of the horizontal trace interval. As the deflection current steadily increases during the start up interval, the amplitude of the horizontal retrace pulses 79 applied along conductor line 80 also increases. A horizontal rate sawtooth voltage is developed at input pin 6 of comparator 90. This sawtooth voltage is obtained by the integration of flyback pulses 79 by resistorR3 and capacitor C5 after being square wave shaped by a zener diode D6. The sawtooth voltage at pin 6 of comparator 90 advances the triggering of the comparator and the turn on of SCR 76 relative to the turn on instant produced by the leading edge of square wave voltage 56. SCR 76 gradually conducts longer, and increasingly greater amounts of energy are transferred to the flyback transformer secondary winding coupled load circuits until a steady state equilibrium condition has been achieved. During steady state operation, a diode D4 rectifies retrace pulse 79 to produce a DC control voltage at a terminalE across a capacitor C4. The DC control voltage varies with retrace pulse amplitude variations. The DC control voltage is level shifted by a zener diode D5 and combined with the sawtooth voltage at pin 6 of comparator 90 to vary the triggering of comparator 90 and the turn on of SCR 76 so as to maintain the retrace pulse voltage amplitude relatively constant. To provide for the slow increase in the input voltage Vin, start up control circuit 59 initially turns onSCR 27 immediately prior to the zero crossover instants of the mains supply voltage. The full wave rectified mains supply voltage V64, illustrated in FIGURE 5a, is applied to an input pin 4 of a comparator 92. Comparator 92 inverts and limits the rectified mains supply voltage to produce a square wave voltage VA, illustrated in FIGURE 5b, at a terminal A, the output pin 2 of comparator 92. The positive portion of square wave voltage VA occurs between times t1 t4 encompassing the zero crossover instant t3 of the full wave rectified mains supply voltage V64. Square wave voltage VA is differentiated by a capacitor 88 and a resistor 89 to produce the voltage VB across resistor 89 at a terminal B, as illustrated in FIGURE 5c. The negative differentiated spike portion of the voltage VB occurring at the trailing edge of the square wave voltage VA at time t4 is applied to an input pin 6 of monostable switch 93, at.a terminal C. The voltage at pin 6 of monostable switch 93 is square wave shaped by a diode D1 to produce the negative pulse voltage VD1 at time t4, illustrated in FIGURE 5d. The negative going edge of the pulse VD1 causes the monostable switch 93 to switch ouput state voltages at output pin 1, at a terminal D. As illustrated in FIGURE 5e, the voltage VD at terminal D goes high at time t4. The output of monostable switch 93 remains high for a predetermined interval t4 t8 of FIGURE 5e. The duration t4 tg of the unstable high output state of monostable switch 93 is determined by the voltage VCl developed at input pin 6 of monostable switch 93 after the occurrence of the negative pulse VD1, as illustrated in FIGURES 5d and 5e. During the occurrence of the first several gating pulses for SCR 27, the voltage at pin 6 of monostable switch 93 is determined by the values of voltage dividing resistors 96 and 97 in parallel with resistor 128.These values are selected to enable monostable switch 93 to switch back to its stable low state at the instant t2 or t8, an instant immediately prior to the zero crossover instant t3 or tg of the voltage V64, as illustrated in FIGURES 5a and 5e. The negative going edge at time t2 or t8 of the resultant square wave output voltage VD of monostable 93 is differentiated by the network 120 125 to apply a negative spike voltage 98 to the base of a driver transistor Q4 to turn the transistor on, as illustrated by the base voltageVbQ4 and by the collector voltage VcQ4 of FIGURES 5f and 5g.The resulant pulsed collector voltage comprises the gating pulses 179 of FIGURE 5g. Pulses 179 are applied through transformer 61 to turn on SCR 27 at times t2 and t8 immediately prior to zero crossover instants t3 and t9 of the full wave rectified AC mains voltage V64, as required to provide slow start up operation of deflection circuit 20. Upon initial energization of horizontal deflection circuit 20 of FIGURE 1, when on off switch 83 is closed, undesirable transient voltages may be developed which can spuriously trigger SCR 27 at instants other than near the zero crossover instants of the mains supply voltage. An inhibit circuit 126, illustrated in FIGURE 3, is included in the control circuit 59 of SCR 27. Inhibit circuit 126 disables the output of monostable switch 93, thereby preventing ,transistor Q4 from turning on and triggering SCR 27.Inhibit circuit 126 is activated for a predetermined interval, typically around 0.5 to 1 second. After the elapse of this inhibit interval, the output of monostable 93 is no longer disabled, thereby permitting the triggering of SCR 27 immedilately prior to a zero crossover instant of the mains supply voltage. Inhibit circuit 126 comprises a flip flop 95 having an output pin 14 coupled to the output path of monostable switch 93 by way of a diode D3. Immediately after closure of on off switch 83, the output of flip flop 95 is low or grounded, thereby grounding terminal F which is coupled to the anode of diode D3. SCR 27 cannot be triggered as long as output pin 14 of flip flop 95 is in the low or ground state. After approximately 0.8 second, as determined by the time constant of a resistor R2 and a capacitor C3, capacitorC3 has charged sufficiently to raise the voltage at input pin 9 of flip flop 95 to a value that will cause flip flop 95 to change output states at pin 14. Diode D3 becomes reverse biased and the output of monostable switch 93 is now permitted to turn on transistor Q4 and trigger SCR 27. During the 0.8 second inhibit interval, when the output pin 14 of flip flop 95 is grounded, a capacitor C2, coupled to output pin 14 through a diode 127, is maintained in a discharged state. After the elapse of the inhibit interval, output pin 14 goes high, reverse biasing diode 127 and permitting capacitor C2 to charge from the 6.8 volt supply through a resistor R1. The increasing voltage across capacitor C2 is applied to input pin 6 of monostable switch 93 through a diode D2 and a resistor 128. Since the duration of the unstable high output state of monostable switch 93 is a function of the voltage VC at pin 6 of monostable switch 93, increasing the voltage VC by charging capacitor C2 results in the shortening of the unstable high output state at terminal D. As illustrated in FIGURE 5d, as capacitor C2 charges, the voltage VC at pin 6 of monostable switch 93 continuously increases from the value VCl to the value VC2, and then to the value VC3. As illustrated in FIGURES 5e and 5g, the increasing voltage applied by capacitor C2 to input pin 6 of monostable switch 93 shortens,the duration of the unstable high state of monostable switch 93. The output of monostable switch 93 returns to its stable low state at a continuously advancing instant, such as the advanced instant t6, and then the advanced instant t5, resulting in the continuous phase advance of the triggering of SCR 27 away from near the zero crossover instant to the instant t6, for example, and then to the instant t5. As the triggering instant of SCR 27 phase advances, increasingly greater amounts of input current flow from source 21 through SCR 27 to charge capacitor 29 to provide a slowly increasing voltage Vin, as is required for soft start up operation of deflection circuit 20. As the input voltage Vin approaches its steady state level, a trigger comparator 91 is enabled and switches transistor Q4 into conduction each horizontal deflection cycle to trigger SCR 27 into conduction each deflection cycle.An output pin 1 of comparator 91 is coupled to the base of transistor Q4 through a resistor 129. The horizontal deflection rate square wave switching voltage 56 is applied to the positive input pin terminal 3 of comparator 91 along conductor line 81. The increasing voltage developed across capacitor C2 is applied to the inverting input pin 2 of comparator 91. As the voltage across capacitor C2 reaches its steady state level, the voltage applied to inverting pin 2 of comparator 91 is sufficiently great to trigger the comparator into the low output state upon the occurrence of the negative going edge of the horizontal deflection rate square wave voltage 56. When the output of comparator 91 goes low, transistor Q4 is turned on, thereby triggeringSCR 27 into conduction. Triggering SCR 27 at a horizontal rate as steady state conditions are approached ensures the optimal triggering of the SCR as soon as the full wave rectified mains supply voltage V64 applied to the anode ofSCR 27 exceeds the SCR cathode potential. The low voltage power supply 180 of FIGURE 1 provides 15 volts DC and 25 volts DC at terminals L and M, respectively, for energizing horizontal oscillator 55, horizontal driver 57, regulator circuit 58, and start up control circuit 59 during start up. Power supply 180 also provides 6.8 volts DC at terminal N for energizing circuits 58 and 59 both during start up and steady state operation. A detailed embodiment of power supply 180 is illustrated in FIGURE 6. A zener diode 86 maintains the voltage at terminal N at 6.8 volts DC. Zener bias is obtained through a resistor 87 from the 24 volts DC at terminal 67 developed by power supply 85. During start up, the 24 volts at terminal 67 is applied to terminal M through a resistor 181 and a diode 182.The start up voltage at terminal M, although less than the steady state terminal M voltage of 25 volts DC, is sufficient to energize horizontal driver 57 into operation. During steady state operation, flyback transformer 30 of FIGURE 1 provides 25 volts DC at terminal M of FIGURE 6 through terminal 38 and a diode 183. During steady state operation, diode 182 is reverse biased, disconnecting power supply 85 from terminal M. Also, during start up, the 24 volts at terminal 67 is applied to terminal L through resistor 181, a transistor 184 and a diode 185. The start up voltage at terminal L, although less than the steady state terminal L voltage of 15 volts DC, is sufficient to energize horizontal oscillator 55, regulator circuit 58 and start up and control circuit 59 into operation. During steady state operation, the flyback transformer derived voltage of 15 volts DC developed at terminal 41 is applied through a diode 186 to reverse bias diode 185 and to establish the 15 volts steady state DC voltage at terminal L. As indicated previously, the 24 volts DC at terminal 67 may be used to power a high wattage audio circuit, illustrated in FIGURE 6 as the audio circuit 190. Audio circuit 190 comprises an audio amplifier 192 with an output terminal AC coupled through a capacitor 193 to the primary winding of a coupling transformer 194. The secondary winding of transformer 194 is coupled to the voice coil 195 of a loudspeaker 196. Audio frequency signals are applied to input terminal 191 of audio amplifier 192. These signals are amplified by audio amplifier 192 to generate current in voice coil 195, thereby producing sound emanations from loudspeaker 196 in accordance with the sound information content of the signals. Audio circuit 190 may be a relatively high wattage load, consuming, illustratively, 10 20 watts power.If audio load circuit 190 were to draw its load current from a flyback transformer secondary winding supply voltage, such as from terminal 38, substantial undesirable retrace pulse voltage modulation may occur due to variations in load current being drawn from the flyback transformer secondary winding. These load current variations may be the result of sound content changes in the audio input signals applied to terminal 191. To avoid undesirable audio retrace pulse modulation, the 24 volt DC supply is provided by the same power supply 85 as is used to precharge DC blocking capacitor 47. The audio load current is now drawn from the mains supply source through transformer 62 rather than through flyback transformer 30. Short circuit, overload and deflection generator malfunction protection is provided by a shutdown circuit 132 incorporated into the control circuit 59 and illustrated in FIGURE 3. A trigger comparator 94 has its output pin 13 coupled to input pin 8 of flip flop 95. The inverting input pin 10 of trigger comparator 94 is coupled through a capacitor 131 to terminal E. The voltage at terminal E represents the rectified retrace pulse voltage amplitude. If the regulator ITR 75 short circuits, or if the ultor load short circuits due to picture tube arcing, or if deflection generator 48 malfunctions and fails to produce retrace pulse voltages, the voltage at terminal E decreases to zero. Trigger comparator 94 senses the collapsing voltage at terminal E and switches to the high output state, thereby triggering flip flop 95 into the low output state.When the output of flip flop 95 is low or grounded, capacitor C2 is discharged, disabling the operation of both monostable switch 93 and trigger comparator 91. Transistor Q4 cannot be turned on, thereby removing trigger pulses from SCR 27 and maintaining the SCR in the off state. The input voltage Vin is removed, thereby disabling and shutting down operation of horizontal deflection circuit 20. After shutdown, the start up sequence for horizontal deflection circuit 20 is reinitiated. If the fault condition persists, shutdown will again occur and eventually fuse 84 will open.
