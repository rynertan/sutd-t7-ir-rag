# Process for the preparation of tertiary butyl alcohol.

## Abstract
A process for preparing tertiary butyl alcohol from isobuty lene comprising reacting isobutylene or a hydrocarbon mix ture containing isobutylene with an aqueous solution of an aliphatic carboxylic acid having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms in the presence of a solid, acidic ion exchange resin as catalyst to produce an aqueous reaction mixture of a major a mount of tertiary butyl alcohol and a minor amount of the tertiary butyl ester of the carboxylic acid, characterised by the steps of 1 subjecting said reaction mixture 4 to distillation 103 to remove unreacted isobutylene or hydrocarbon mixture therefrom, and thereafter 2 supplying the treated reaction mixture of step 1 to a distillation column 104 and passing water 9 downwardly through said distillation column 104 to remove said tertiary butyl ester of the carboxylic acid.
