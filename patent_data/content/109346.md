# VISCOUS DAMPER WITH ROTOR CENTERING MEANS

## Abstract
A bearing for a rotatable shaft 18 supporting a plurality of compressor blades 20 and a plurality of turbine blades 22 comprises a fluid damper 32 including a cavity adjacent the bearing in which fluid is fed to support said bearing when in the rotating mode. The shaft 18 is distortable as a function of the depth of said cavity and radially displacing said compressor blades a similar amount, the tips of said blades being sufficient ly spaced to prevent touching of the inner diameter of a sur rounding casing. A centering spring 30 is attached to said damper of the bearing for preventing said one bearing from displacing the depth of said cavity and said spring being at tached to said casing.
