# Electrical component forming process.

## Abstract
The process of forming a composite 16 with an alloy 10 having an alloy component of about .5 to 12 aluminum and a matrix selected from a material of the group consisting of copper, iron and nickel. The alloy is heated in an oxygen rich atmosphere to form a material oxide rich layer 12 on a surface 18 of the alloy 10 . The alloy 10 is then heated in a reducing atmosphere to reduce the material oxide rich layer 12 to form an aluminum oxide 20 on the surface of the alloy and a material rich layer 22 on the aluminum oxide layer.
