## Description
Women in the postmenopausal age range now number approximately 40,000,000 in the United States alone, and each of these women faces an average life expectancy of 28 years beyond the last menstrual period. A recent review estimates that 75 to 85 of postmenopausal women will develop symptoms secondary to estrogen deficiency. C.Hammond, M.D., et al., Current Status of Estrogen Therapy for the Menopause, Perhaps the most common group of complaints of the patient following ovarian failure is the vasomotor symptom complex. The hot flash is classically described as a sudden onset of warmth in the face and neck which usually progresses to the chest. This sensation generally lasts several minutes and is often accompanied by a visible red flush. These episodes may be exceedingly uncomfortable and are frequently associated with dizziness, nausea, headaches, palpitations and diaphoresis. Estrogen supplementation will provide significant relief in over 90 of such patients. Progressive atrophy of the genitourinary system commonly accompanies old age and is related both estrogen deprivation and to the normal aging process. The vagina, cervix, corpus uteri, fallopian tubes, urethra and bladder trigone all have large numbers of estrogen receptors and are sensitive to a decrease in available estrogen. The vagina exhibits marked atrophic changes secondary to estrogen deprivation, characterised by thinnings of the epithelium loss of rugation and a reduction in lubrication during sexual intercourse. Atrophic vaginitis accounts for approximately 15 of postmenopausal bleeding and contributes significantly to dyspareunia. Atrophy of the urethra in general parallels similar changes in the vagina. A significant consequence of urethral atrophy is the occurrence of dysuria, frequency of urination and urinary urgency. Systemic or intravaginal estrogen therapy dramaticallly reverses the atrophic process. The most serious of postmenopausal complications is osteoporosis. In women over 60 years of age, 25 have documented spinal compression fractures as a result of osteoporosis. As many as 50 of women will have developed vertebral fracture by age 75. The risk of hip fractures increases with age and reaches 20 by age 90. Eighty percent 80 of hip fractures are felt to be related to pre existing osteoporosis. Even more devastating is the fact that approximately one sixth of women with hip fractures die within three months following their fracture. A Mayo Clinic study calculates the health care costs of fracture hospital stays at over 1,000,000,000 per year. J. Gallagher, et al., Epidemiology of Fractures of the Proximal Femur in Rochester, Minn., Numerous mechanisms for postmenopausal osteoporosis have been proposed, tested and reviewed. Current theories include contributions of dietary factors and calcium intake, aging, genetic susceptibility, Vitamin D status and the hormone control of bone deposition and absorption including roles for estrogen, androgens, parathyroid hormones, growth hormones and calcitonin. Current treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis include fluoride, Vitamin D and calcium supplementation, increased physical activity and estrogen replacement therapy as the primary choice. The precise mechanism of the action of estrogen on bone metabolism is unknown. There are no estrogen receptors which have been identified in bone, and estrogen does not appear to stimulate osteoblastic activity. Estrogen therapy does not replace bone which has already been lost, and if discontinued, more rapid bone loss results. Because of the potential severity and frequency of postmenopausal complications, long term estrogen replacement therapy is a frequent practice. However, this has generated a great deal of controversy. Estrogen therapy has been implicated in the development of a variety of disorders. The Boston Collaborative Drug Surveillance Program indicated a summary risk ratio for gallbladder disease in postmenopausal women taking estrogen of 2.5. Boston Collab. Drug Surv., Surgically Confirmed Gallbladder Disease, Venous Thromboembolism, and Breast Tumors in Relation to Postmenopausal Estrogen Therapy A role of estrogen in the development of benign breast disease has been suggested. The presence of estrogen receptors in the breast has been well documented, and estrogen may induce cystic or dysplastic changes demonstrated by mammography in postmenopausal women. Estrogen can induce mammary tumors in animals, particularly in susceptible strains of mice and rats. Some breast cancers in women respond to oophorectomy, suggesting a role in humans of estrogen in the stimulation and maintenance of breast neoplasia. Unopposed estrogenic stimulation has also been implicated in the development of endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial carcinoma. Progestins given regularly and for a sufficient length of time appear to be protective against endometrial cancer. Postmenopausal women treated with estrogen progestin combination, however, frequently experience regular uterine bleeding which is unacceptable to many of them. For these reasons, an alternative to estrogen replacement therapy would have wide spread application. Efforts to counteract the ill effects of estrogen therapy include estrogen therapy coupled with short periods of antiestrogen supplementation. The literature is replete with studies of the activity of antiestrogens in varying situations. Many writers observed that some antiestrogens had weak estrogenic effects. Apparently due to concern about the compounded estrogenic effect which might arise when estrogen and weakly estrogenic antiestrogens are administered together, antigonadotropic agents which were substantially free from estrogenic effects began to appear, as shown in U.S. Patent No. 3,843,727 and U.S. Patent No. 3,697,581. These nonestrogenic antiestrogens were developed for administration along with estrogen to counteract the harmful effects of estrogen therapy. Some researchers took an objective interest in the weak estrogenic effect of antiestrogens. In spite of all the literature, there is currently no treatment of postmenopausal symptoms in which estrogen is not administered. A regime including estrogen may be workable for those women having only minor contraindications to estrogen therapy however, for some women, estrogen is absolutely contra indicated. For these women, there is presently no satisfactory treatment. According to the invention a true antiestrogen is used for the manufacture of a medicament for use in a method of treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women in the absence of estrogen administration, in which the antiestrogen is selected from tamoxifen nafoxidine CI 680 CI 628 CN 55, 945 27 MER 25 U 11,555A U 11, 100A ICI 46, 669 ICI 46, 474 a compound having the formula wherein R₁ is selected from hydrogen, an aromatic group or an alkyl group having no more than 9 carbon atoms, and R is selected from aromatic groups and C₁ or C₃ ₉ alkyl groups diphenolhydrochrysene erythro MEA Parke Davis CN 55, 945 allenolic acid cyclofenil ethyamoxytriphenol triparanol and a compound having the formula wherein one of the R s is a basic ether of the formula OC A true antiestrogen differs from the nonestrogenic antiestrogens as discussed, for example, in U.S Patents 3,843,727 and 3,697,581 in that it has weak estrogenic effects. A true antiestrogen binds estrogen receptors, competing with estrogen therefore. In the presence of estrogen, a true antiestrogen inhibits estrogenic effects. In the progressive absence of estrogen, true antiestrogens exhibit progressively stronger estrogenic effects. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a true antiestrogen, preferably zuclomiphene citrate or clomiphene citrate, is administered to an estrogen deficient subject, e.g., a postmenopausal woman. The true antiestrogen may be administered in a variety of ways, such as injection, food supplementation, etc., a preferred form of administration being tablets. The true antiestrogen is administered on a regular basis, depending upon the period the true antiestrogen remains active in the subject s system. The true antiestrogen may only by needed weekly or monthly however, the invention also contemplates administration of the antiestrogen more frequently, up to several times a day, depending upon the patient s needs and capacity for the drug, and upon the characteristics of the particular drug. Each dose of true antiestrogen preferably is 0.4 3.0 micromoles kg body weight, or more preferably 0.7 2 micromoles kg body weight. The true antiestrogen of this invention may be any one of the following compounds wherein R₁ can be hydrogen, an aromatic group or an alkyl group, the alkyl group having no more than 9 carbon atoms, and R can be an aromatic group or an alkyl group, the alkyl group preferably having 1 or 3 to 9 carbon atoms, the derivatives of this invention including only those derivatives exhibiting true antiestrogenic effects. The invention the excludes diethylstilbestrol, wherein both R s are an ethyl group, and R₁ is a hydrogen group wherein one of the R s is a basic ether of the formula OC Despite the heterogeneity in the chemical configuration of true antiestrogens, these compounds have a common mode of action. The estrogenic activity of these weakly estrogenic true antiestrogen manifests itself more strongly as the bodily estrogen levels decrease. In those women who cannot take estrogen and have no bodily estrogen production, the true antiestrogen will exhibit its strongest estrogenic effects. These beneficial estrogenic effects will be achieved in the absence of the harmful effects of estrogen discussed above. Not only will the harmful side effects of estrogen be avoided, but also many true antiestrogen have been used as therapeutic agents to help treat the side effects of estrogen. This therapeutic value is an added advantage of the treatment embodied in the invention. A preferred embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in the following example Twently postmenopausal or castrate females will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. Patients in one group will receive cyclic estrogen replacement therapy. Patients in the second group will be treated with clomiphene citrate at 12.5 mg day or 25 mg day. A typical patient will be a postmenopausal woman, 60 years of age, approximately 130 lbs. None of the subjects will have had 1 prior treatment with estrogenic agents less than sixty 60 days prior to treatment 2 a history of endometrial or breast cancer 3 a previous hysterectomy less than sixty 60 days prior to treatment 4 a significant underlying disease which might interfere with evaluation of the patient s response to therapy or 5 a history of thromboembolism. Clomiphene citrate is a mixture of isomers of the compounds having the following structure No estrogen will be administered to those subjects receiving clomiphene citrate. The clomiphene citrate and cyclic estrogens will be administered daily for three months. During those three months, baseline measurements in both groups will include 24 hour urinary estrogen, hydroxyproline, creatinine excretion, serum LH, FSH, cholesterol, high density lipoprotein, ionised calcium, parathyroid hormone PTH , calcitonin, SMA 6 and SMA 12, blood pressure, weight, vaginal cytology and endometrial histology. Photon absorptiometry will be performed for determining bone density if possible. Subjects will be hospitalised and fed a protein free diet prior to collection of the 24 hour urine sample. All blood samples for PTH will be collected between 8 00 a.m. and 10 00 a.m to avoid error secondary to diurnal variations. Menopausal symptoms will be quantified using the Kuperman Menopausal Index, H. Kupperman, et al., Comparative Clinical Evaluation of Estrogenic Preparations by the Menopausal and Amenorrheal Indices, At the end of three months, it is expected that the above described Kupperman symptoms, being symptoms secondary to estrogen deficiency, will be alleviated by clomiphene citrate to an extent at least comparable to the relief experienced by the patients undergoing estrogen therapy. Further, clomiphene citrate has been demonstrated to maintain the level of total body calcium in ovariectomised rats at levels similar to the levels retained by estrogen producing rats. Estrogen deficient rats not receiving clomiphene citrate, however, experience bone loss. The dosage of clomiphene citrate in Example 1 can range from 12.5 100 mg. Following the procedure of Example 1, clomiphene citrate is replaced by 12.5 100 mg day of zuclomiphene citrate, the cisisomer of clomiphene citrate, having the following structure Results similar to those achieved in Example 1 are expected, i.e., estrogen deficient subjects undergoing zuclomiphene citrate therapy should be relieved of secondary estrogen deficiency symptoms in a manner comparable to the relief achieved with estrogen therapy.
