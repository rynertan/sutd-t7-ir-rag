# Method and apparatus for recovering information from a videodisc.

## Abstract
A system for recovering information from a videodisc and performing special functions which enhance the opera tional character of the system. To increase the reliability of landing at or near a target track, provisions are made to search for a track adjacent a target track whose track iden tifier has been obliterated. Further, a method and means for stepping forward or reverse one field at a time is disclosed. Another aspect of the invention concerns a capability to respond to a random command instruction resulting in subequent functioning of the system in a random manner. Yet a further aspect of the invention is related to controlled jumping of one or more tracks during vertical blanking time produce unique forward or backward motions multiples of playing speed, both forward and reverse, and visual special effects can be realized using the multiple track jumping feature. Finally, a method and means are described which permit synchronous transmission of video from a videodisc to an external using device.
