# Apparatus for mixing liquids.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a device for dosing and mixing of two or more liquids. According to the invention, the liquids are led to a chamber 26 where they are mixed, an outlet 30 from the chamber being closed at the same time. When the chamber 26 has been filled, the outlet 30 is opened while the inlets 21, 22 for the starting liquids are simultaneously closed, and when the chamber 26 has been emptied, the outlet 30 is closed again and the inlet or inlets 21, 22 are opened. This cyclic process is repeated any desired number of times. The chamber has a variable volume, and changes of the volume are sensed by a sensor 28 , which controls the opening and closing of the inlets and the outlets. The device for carrying out the method is provided with a mechanical bistable flip flop device, which in one of its stable positions opens the inlets 21,22 and closes the outlet 30 , and in the other stable position closes the inlets and opens the outlet. The shifting between the two stable posi tions is controlled by the sensor 28 . Alternatively, the flip flop device may be arranged to open and close the inlets, while the outlet remains open, and to close the outlet only when the supply of liquids is essenti ally exhausted. It has been found that the invention is especially suit able for use at infusion of a mixture of two or more liquids into a patient.
