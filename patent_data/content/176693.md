# Process for protecting vapor deposited metal layers.

## Abstract
A process for improving the abrasion resistance of vapour deposited metal layers which comprises vapour depositing a metal or metalloid layer on at least one surface of a substrate, and before subjecting the metal layer to physical treatment or contact which would abrade the metal layer, vapour depositing onto said metal layer a 1 to 600 nm layer of organic material having a vapour pressure at 20 DEG C equal to or less than that of 1 n octanol, said material having a a carbonyl group not part of a carboxyl group, b a phenoxy group, c an ester group, or d an alcohol group. The organic materials can improve the properties of the metal layer when used in photoresist imaging films.
