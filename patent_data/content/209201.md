## Description
The invention relates to a method of automatically cooking food in an oven in which a signal representative of at least one parameter indicative of the extent to which cooking has been completed is fed back to a device controlling a source of the energy employed in cooking, the weight of the food being cooked being measured as cooking proceeds. In DE C2 32 05 124 a microwave oven is described in which during cooking at several time intervals the weight of the food is measured and compared with a calculated final or desired weight in order to control the process. Such a weighing measurement only is not sufficient for a reliable control of the cooking process. Therefore to compensate for intervening factors sensors are located in the inlet and outlet air paths of the cooking chamber, the signals therof being used for additional control of the process. The object of the present invention is to improve the above described method in which use is made only of weight sensing to control the process. According to the invention the method is characterized in that the weight decrease rate of the food is the parameter fed back to the control device. It turned out that the weight decrease rate is a very reliable parameter for sensing the condition of the food. For example, the weight decrease will not be constant until a moment when the food has been heated down to an appreciable depth below the surface so that its cooling due to heat convection inwardly is small. The surface temperature then does not need to be 100 C because the power balance due to convective and evaporative surface cooling can occur earlier. In one embodiment of the invention a final heating power and time are initiated when said weight decrease rate reaches a predetermined level. Initiating the final heating is inhibited if the running heating time is greater than a predetermined heating time. A further embodiment of the invention is characterized in that after starting an initial heating power another parameter representing the difficulty of heating said food based upon the time required for said weight to reach a predetermined weight is determined, said parameter being used for the selection of a heating power for continued heating. The invention also relates to a microwave oven for carrying out the above described method comprising a microwave source for feeding microwave energy into the oven cavity where the food to be cooked is placed, a weighing device for weighing the food inside the cavity and delivering an analogue signal indicative of the measured weight, an analogue to digital converter for converting the analogue signal into a digital signal, characterized in that it comprises a control device responsive to said digital signal for controlling the microwave source in respect of power level and or remaining cooking time in dependence on the weight decrease rate of the food as cooking proceeds. The invention is illustrated by means of the accompanying drawings, in which In Fig. 1, showing the power balance during heating at a temperature of 40 C, P0 represents supplied power, P1 represents the evaporative losses, P2 represents the convective losses, P3 represents losses due to heating of the vessel, while P4 represents the utilized power, i.e., the power which is dissipated in the food and which causes temperature increase therein. It is evident that the main part of the supplied power is utilized in the food, while the evaporative loss power as well as remaining loss powers are relatively small as compared with the utilized power. In Fig. 2 showing the power balance of cooking about 100 C , P0 again represents supplied power, while P1 represents the evaporative losses and P2 the convective losses. The utilized power in the food is zero including loss due to heating of the vessel. In this case,all supplied power also must be removed, which usually takes place by evaporation. This will result in a constant weight decrease rate. An evaporative loss power of 300 W,for example, corresponds to a weight decrease rate of 8g minute at a surface temperature of 80 C. During the transition from the heating condition according to Fig. 1 to the cooking condition according to Fig. 2, the evaporative losses will vary with time, resulting in a weight decrease rate which varies with time. By measuring the weight decrease or weight decrease rate, it is thus possible to obtain a reliable indication of how far the heating has advanced. Fig. 3 shows some curves over the weight decrease S as a function of the time It is evident that the weight decrease as such not always gives the best indication on how far the heating has advanced. It is furthermore evident that a humidity sensor supplying a signal at a given relatively low derivata see Fig. 3 should produce values which must be corrected due to inner convection, covering, if any, and quantity in order to be fully usuable. However, if the initial weight and the variation rate of the weight are known,an appreciably improved system can be constructed. According to the invention, this may be done in the following manner, reference being made to Fig. 3 In the marked case t₁ 1a If heating is concerned the heating process can be interrupted immediately the temperature is ca. 65 C . If desired, the heating time can be elongated with ca. 30 which results in a final temperature of 75 C. In the case t₁ 2 The heating continues with a relatively low power this has not been done in the curve . After a while v V will be a given pre programmed value perhaps after 3 minutes . Then the heating continues further 30 of the total heating time until then, whereafter the food is ready. Fig. 4 shows schematically a microwave oven with magnetron and a basic diagram for a control circuit, by means of which the principles of the invention can be realized. In the drawing A designates an oven cavity, B is a magnetron which via a waveguide connection not shown feeds microwave energy into the cavity and C is a start stop circuit for the magnetron. In C is included a timer and an intermittently operating switch arrangement, as a cam follower device, whereby the average power delivered by the magnetron can be set. A weighing scale D is,according to the invention,placed in the bottom of the cavity and continuously measures the weight of the introduced food. The scale, which may be of strain gauge type, delivers an electrical signal which represents the instantaneous value of the measured weight. This signal is fed to an analogue to digital converter E, in which it is converted to a digital signal, and is thereafter applied to a control device F. At a second input the control device F receives signals from a keyboard G and delivers its output signal to the start stop circuit for the magnetron. The keyboard G can also be directly connected to the start stop circuit for pure manual setting. When operating with automatic control, the heating or cooking process is according to the invention controlled with signals derived from the weight indicating signal delivered by the scale D. The control device F comprises for this purpose memory means, in which the initial weight of the introduced food with reduction for the weight of the vessel is stored. Furthermore the control device F has calculating means which from the weight indicating signal derives magnitudes representing the weight decrease and or the weight decrease rate. By means of these magnitudes initial weight, weight decrease and or weight decrease rate, the heating or cooking process is controlled such that an optimal result is obtained in each individual heating case. The control device F can suitably comprise a microprocessor or the like, which is pre programmed to perform a desired function. An example of a flow diagram for a program which is executed by a microprocessor included in the control device is given in Fig. 5. The process is started by pushing an on button, represented by the block 10 in Fig. 5, whereby the oven is made clear for use. Thereafter taring is effected by putting the empty vessel into the oven and pushing a button marked taring represented by the block 11 in Fig. 5, whereby the vessel is weighed and the weight of the vessel M where In the block 23 the following question is M small, A large and heating desired is made. If the answer to this question is yes then the heating process can be interrupted, the block 24, and oven returns to the ready position for new heating. If the answer in the block 23 is no then the process will continue, which is effected by selection of power. The power selection is made in dependence of the parameter A and in the block 25 the question is A larger than x is made, The constants Immediatley after the selection of power level for the continued heating a parameter V is determined, which parameter is defined as the maximal weight decrease per time unit, i.e., the weight decrease rate at temperature equilibrium and for the selected power. This is effected in the block 31 in Fig. 5. During the continued heating with the selected power a measuring procedure takes place, which leads to final heating and switching off of the oven. This is effected by means of the weight decrease rate, which is determined intermittently with a time interval of t where M In the block 35 the question is v This ratio v If the answer in the block 38 is no then in block 41 the question is v where At the same time the final power where After setting of the final power P
