# Magnetic reproducing system.

## Abstract
A magnetic material 1b 2 whose high frequency char acteristics vary in response to a signal field recorded on a magnetic recording medium 1 is provided as a magnetic layer in a high frequency coupling circuit including the magnetic recording medium 1 and a reproduction head 5 . The coupling degree of the high frequency coupling circuit noticeably varies with the change of the high frequency characteristics of the magnetic material 1b 2 , thereby enabling the reproduction of the recorded signal by utilizing the change of the high frequency characteristics.
