# COMPOSITE FLEXIBLE PULP REFINER DISK AND METHOD OF MAKING SAME

## Abstract
Improved thickness tolerance, easier assembling and substantial economies are attained by constructing resilient ly flexible refiner disks 17, 18 by affixing refining surface ring plates 28, 32 to the disk margins by structural bonding agent, epoxy being preferred. In making the refining disk assembly 5 , the disk 17, 18 may be formed from fiberglass or fiberglass epoxy composite or stainless steel and the epoxy adhered assembly cured in a curing zone wherein, if the disk 17, 18 is formed from an uncured fiberglass material, the disk 17, 18 may be curved at the same time as the bonding agent.
