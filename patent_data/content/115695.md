# Improved tiltable valve employing a moveable cup.

## Abstract
A stem tiltable valve assembly 21 whose valve body is provided with a reciprocally moveable stem 39 which, when tilted, actuates a moveable cup member 45 that incorporates a resilient gasket 50 which normally makes sealing engage ment with a flange 41 of stem 39 . The valve assembly 21 provides a capability for a maximized diameter in stem 39 and valve 21 to achieve a maximized fill flow through stem 39 when the valve stem 39 is tilted to open the valve 21 .
