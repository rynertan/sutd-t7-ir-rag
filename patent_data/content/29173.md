# A green house curtain.

## Abstract
A rollable and drapeable green house curtain with insulating power. The curtain comprises double fabric paths 10, 11 separated along their entire length and width and interconnected by means of a plurality of thin and flexible threads 12 sparsely distributed over the surface of the curtain. In the intervals between rows 19 of connecting threads 12 there could be arranged strips 20 of a heat reflecting material, e.g. metallized foil, in order to make the curtain as an effective barrier against radiant heat. The curtain is manufactured on a warp knitting machine with two needle bars and the connecting threads 12 consist of connecting stitches between the double fabric paths.
