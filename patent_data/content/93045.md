# Double acting drive mechanism.

## Abstract
A double acting drive mechanism 10 includes a driving member 12 and a pair of driven members 16 and 18 which carry a small diameter pulley face 24 and a larger diameter pulley face 26 respectively. A clutch mechanism 34 normally couples one of the driven members 16 for rotation with the driving member 12 and the driven member 18 freewheels. Upon energization of the electro magnetic actuator 48 , the armature 56 , which rotates with the other driven member 18 , engages the clutch mechan ism 34 to couple the other driven member 18 for rotation with the driving member 12 . Engagement of the armature 56 with the clutch mechanism 34 disengages the clutch mechanism 34 from the one driven member 16 .
