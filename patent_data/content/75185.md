# DUST EVACUATION FOR A HOLLOW DRILL

## Abstract
A drilling tool 22 rotated by a driving source is of cylindrical shape provided with a chamber 23 inside and intended to drill a ring shaped hole 42 in a surface to be drilled. A pumping means 34 is arranged to suck air from the lower end of the drilling tool into the chamber 23 through the ring shaped hole 42 which is being drilled and to discharged air outside the chamber 23 . The drilling tool 22 has a blade which is so shaped as to provide outer und inner clearances in the ring shaped hole 42 to suck air as a high speed air flow into the chamber 23 through the ring shaped hole 42 . The chamber 23 of the drilling tool has a large cross sectional area relative to that of the outer and inner clearances in the ring shaped hole 42 so as to quick ly slow down the air sucked in the chamber 23 .
