# CONTROLLABLE JOINT

## Abstract
A controllable joint 10 has first 12 and second 40 members with first A and second C axes respectively. The first member supports at least three coupling members 30 , each movable relative to the first axis. Each coupling member is received by the second member for movement relative to the second axis. Means 16 are provided for selectively controlling the coupling memberrs, thereby de termining the position of the second member relative to the first member.
