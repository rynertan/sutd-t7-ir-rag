## Description
SILVER HALIDE COLOR PHOTOGRAPHIC LIGHT SENSITIVE MATERIALS FIELD OF THE INVENTION trips invention relates to a silver halide color photographic light sensitive material and more particularly to a color photographic light sensitive material for photographing having simultaneously improved graininess and sharpness. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Recently, the picture size of a photographic film have been reduced to miniaturize cameras and increase their portability. However, it is well known that reduction of the picture size cause deterioration of the image print quality. In other words, if the picture size of a color photographic light sensitive material is reduced, the enlarging magnification for obtaining a print of the same size must be increased, whereby the graininess and sharpness of the printed image are deteriorated to that extent. Accordingly, there is a need to improve the graininess, resolving power, and sharpness of photographic films in order to obtain a good print even when using a miniaturized camera. A technique for improving graininess is described in U.S. Patent No. 3,726,681 wherein the graininess of a high sensitive color photographic material is improved by using a coupler having a fast coupling reaction rate in a high sensitive silver halide emulsion layer and a coupler having a slow coupling reaction rate in a low sensitive silver halide emulsion layer. A technique for improving sharpness involves using either a compound which forms a dye and also releases a development inhibitor by coupling iwth the oxidation product of a color developing agent as described in U.S. Patent Nos.3,148,062 and 3,227,554, or a compound which releases a development inhibitor but does not form a dye by coupling with the oxidation product of a color developing agent as described in U.S. Patent No. 3,632,345 hereinafter, both compounds are referred to as DIR compounds . However, it was found that even by combining the aforesaid two techniques, the improvement of the graininess and the improvement of the sharpness conflict with each other and hence the good image that was expected could not be obtained. The reason is as follows. That is, when a high reaction rate coupler is used in a highsensitive silver halide emulsion layer, the graininess of high density portions is improved but the development of the high sensitive silver halide emulsion layer is accelerated owing to the high reaction rate of the coupler.Therefore, when DIR compound is added to a lowsensitive silver halide emulsion layer adjacent to the high sensitive silver halide emulsion layer, an interlayer effect rrom the low sensitive silver halide emulsion layer to the high sensitive silver halide emulsion layer does not oc cur, whereby an edge effect scarecely occurs in the irr.ases formed in the high sensitive silver halide emulsion layer. This phenomenon is based on the difference in coupling activities of the high reaction rate coupler used in the high sensitive silver halide emulsion layer, the low reaction rate coupler used in the low sensitive silver halide emulsion layer, and the DIR compounds balanced with them. On the other hand, when the method described inBritish Patent No. 923,045 for improving the graininess of high density portions by increasing the coated amount of silver without using the high reaction rate coupler in a high sensitive silver halide emulsion laer so as to increase the ratio of silver halide to a coupler is used together with DIR compounds, the graininess and the adjacency effect may be improved. However, irradiation is increased by scattering of light based on the increased silver halide grains, whereby the sharpness is not improved to the extent expected. In a color photographic material of which graininess is improved by using a low reaction rate coupler in one layer of photographic silver halide emulsion layers being sensitive for the same color and a high reaction rate coupler in another layer of the photographic silver halide emulsion layers being sensitive for the same color, it is necessary for improving the sharpness that the development inhibiting property of all the emulsion layers is increased by either increasing the addition amount of the DIR compound or using a DIR compound having a high development inhibiting degree.However, when the inhibiting property is increased, the sensitivity and coupling property are reduced and in order to correct for the reduction in sensitivity and coupling property, the amounts of silver halide and coupler are increased. This results in reduction of the resolving power in G high spatial frequency region. In order to use the high reaction rate coupler without such a side reaction, it is necessary to increase an MTF value a value at a certain spatial frequency point on an EF modulation transfer function curve at a low spatial frequency region, that is to increase a socalled edge effect, without reducing the sensitivity or without increasing the development inhibiting property. In addition, an MTF curve is described in, for example,Mees, The Theory of the Photographic Process, 3rd edition, page 536 and followings, published by Macmillan Co. . It was found that the above purpose can be attained by using a DIR coupler or a DIR compound capable of releasing a development inhibitor having a high diffusibility the diffusibility being defined hereinafter due to a coupling reaction, hereinafter, the DIR coupler or DIR compound releasing a development inhibitor having a high diffusibility is referred to simply as a diffusible DIR compound . SUIMY OF THE INVENTION A primary object of this invention is to simultaneously improve the granularity and the sharpness of a color photographic material. This object can be attained by a silver halide color photographic light sensitive material comprising a support having formed thereon at least one red sensitive silver halide emulsion layer, at least one greensensitive silver halide emulsion layer, and at least one blue sensitive silver halide emulsion layer and at least one of said color sensitive emulsion layers being composed of plural silver halide emulsion layers i.e., plural silver halide emulsion layers being snesitive to the same color , the highest sensitive emulsion layer of said plural emulsion layers containing a high reaction rate coupler, and another layer or at least one of other layers of said plural emulsion layers containing a relatively low reaction rate coupler having a reaction rate in a range of 1 1.3 to 1 15 of that of the foregoing high reaction rate coupler and a diffusible DIR compound. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is a graph showing MTF curves when the diffusibility of released development inhibitors is changed from 0.1 to 0.8 with the same inhibiting property wherein a shows a case of diffusibility of 0.1 b shows a case of diffusibility of 0.2 c shows a case of diffusibility of 0.4 and d shows a case of diffusibility of 0.8 , and Fig. 2 is a graph showing C bsTF chemical MTF curves when the diffusibility is changed and O MTF optical 4TF curve. In Figs. 1 and 2, the ordinate is the MTF value, M u and the abscissa is spatial frequency u c mm . DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODI1ENTS Changes in MTF curves caused by using diffusibleDIR compounds are theoretically explained below. In the high spatial frequency region, MTF curves are controlled by light scattering, whereas in the low spatial frequency region they are controlled by the edge effect arising from development inhibition. In the former region, MTF curves change depending on the thicknesses of layers present, e.g., silver halide emulsion layers, from which light is scattered. Thus, the thicker the layers, the greater the influence of light scattering becomes.Consequently, MTF curves are greatly lowered in the high spatial frequency region. On the other hand, in the latter region, if the development inhibiting material used has high diffusibility, the edge effect extends to a great ditance. Consequently, MTF curves are raised even in the low spatial frequency region. The C lTF curves of Figure 2 are those obtained by heightening the diffusibility from a to d under the condition that the light scattering does not occur at all and the development inhibiting materials used have the same inhibiting degree. As can be seen therefrom, the higher te diffusibility, the higher the MTF value in the low spatial Frequency region. On the other hand, theO MTF values represent the MTF curve under the condition that there is no edge effect, but a certain level of light scattering is observed. The actual MTF value is that which is obtained by multiplying the value on the C MTF curse at each point, M u , by the value on the c O MTP curve at the corresponding point, Mo u .Therefore, the resultant MTF curves corresponding to the case that development inhibiting materials which have the same inhibiting degree, but differ only in diffusibility, are employed are as shown in Figure 1. From the above explanation, it is understood that the purpose of increasing the edge effect can be attained by increasing the diffusibility of the development inhibitor released even though the inhibitive property of the development inhibitor is same. The foregoing theory leads a method of improving the reduction of the edge effect by using a diffusibleDIR compounwithout deteriorating the sensitivity and coupling property, said edge effect reduction accurring at a side reaction in the case of improving the graininess by using a high reaction rate coupler in a high sensitive silver halide emulsion layer and using a coupler having a reaction rate slower than that of the aforesaid high reaction rate coupler in a low sensitive silver halide emulsion layer being sensitive to the same color as that of the h.gh sensitive silver halide emulsion layer. That is, the present invention is a silver halide color photographic light sensitive material comprising a support having formed thereon at least one red sensitive silver halide emulsion layer, at least one green sensitive silver halide emulsion layer, and at least one blue sensitive silver halide emulsion layer and at least one of said color sensitive emulsion layers being composed of plural silver halide emulsion layers ti.e., plural silver halide emulsion layers being sensitive to the same color , the highest sensitive emulsion layer of said plural emulsion layers containing a high reaction rate coupler, and another layer or at least one of other layers of said plural emulsion layers containing a relative ow reaction rate coupler having a reaction rate in a range of 1 1.3 to 1 15, preferably 1 1.5 to 1 10 of tnat of the foregoing high reaction rate coupler and a diffusible DIR compound. In the photographic material of this invention, the low sensitive silver halide emulsion layer may be a lower sensitive emulsion layer of a double layer type silver halide emulsion layers being sensitive to the same color, or i ay be an intermediate sensitive emulsion layer or a lowest sensitive emulsion layer of a triple layer type silver halide emulsion layers being sensitive to the same color. Also, high reaction rate couplers used in the high sensitive silver halide emulsion layer may be used solely or as a mixture of them, or may be a mixture of the high reaction rate coupler with a low reaction rate coupler if the mixture does not lose the high reactivity.Also, the low sensitive silver halide emulsion layer containing a low reaction rate coupler may contain a high reaction rate coupler in an amount of 30 or less. The amount of the diffusible DIR compound used in the low sensitive silver halide emulsion layer of this invention is 0.0001 mole to 0.05 mole, preferably 0.0003 to 0.01 mole, per mole of silver halide used in the low sensitive silver halide emulsion layer. A conventionalDIR coupler capable of releasing a development inhibitor having relatively less diffusibility or a precursor thereof may be used in the same low sensitive silver halide emulsion layer or a different silver halide emulsion layer. The activity of the DIR compound i.e., the activity of the diffusible DIR compound of the present invention ancL also the activity of the conventional DIR compound may be same as or different from the activity of the coupler used together. It is suitable that the amount of the diffusibleDIR compound used in the low sensitive emulsion layer is 0.001 to 0.3 moles, preferably 0.005 to 0.1 mole, per mole of the low reaction rate coupler The addition amounts of the high reaction rate coupler and the low reaction rate coupler are 0.001 to 0.5 g m2 and 0.2 to 2 g m2, preferably 0.005 to 0.5 g m2 and 0.5 to 2 g m2, xespectively. The coupling reactivity i.e., coupling reaction rate of the high reaction rate coupler and the low reaction rate coupler are determined as relative value with using a different dye forming coupler as a standard i.e., coupler N used herebelow . That is, a coupler M of which coupling reaction rate should be determined is mixed with a standard coupler N wherein the coupler M and the coupler N provide different dyes which can be clearly separated rom each other. The mixture of the couplers EI and N is added to a silver halide emulsion layer followed by color development to form a color image.The amounts of each dye formed in the color image are measured and, therefrom, the coupling reactivity of the coupler M is determined as a relative value in the following manner. When the maximum color density of coupler M is shown by DM max, the color density of coupler M in an intermediate step is shown by DM, the maximum color density of coupler N is shown by DN max, and the color density of coupler N in an intermediate step is shown byDN, the ratio of the reactivities of both couplers, RM RN is shown by the following equation EMI11.1 That is, the silver halide emulsion containing a fixture of the couplers X and N is step wise exposed and followed by color development to obtain several sets of DM and DN. The combinations of DM and DN obtained are plotted asEMI11.2 onto a graph of two axis perpendicularly intersecting each other to obtain a straight line.The coupling activity ratio RM RN is obtained from the inclination of the straight line. Thus, by measuring RM RN values of various couplers M using a definite coupler N in the manner as described above, coupling reactivities are relatively obtained. In this invention, the following couplers were used as the foregoing definite coupler N. For measuring the coupling reactivity. of cyan couplers, the following magenta coupler was used as the coupler N.EMI12.1 For measuring the coupling reactivity of magenta couplers and yellow couplers, the following cyan coupler was used as the coupler N.EMI12.2 Preferred combinations of high reaction rate couplers and low reaction rate couplers are illustrated below.

Examples of bleaching agents which can be used include compounds of polyvalent metals, such as Fe III , Co III , Cr VI , Cu T and the like peroxy acids, quinones, nitroso compounds and so on More specifically, bleaching agents which can be used include ferricyanides, bichromates complex salts formed by Fe CIII or Co III and aminopolycarboxylic acids, such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, nitrilotriacetate, 1,3 diamino 2 propanol tetraacetic acid, etc., or organic acids such as citric acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, etc., persulfates and permanganates nitrosophenol and so on. Among these agents, potassium ferricyanide, sodium ethylenediaminetetraacetanol 40rratc III and ammonium Cethylenediamine tetraacetato ferrate III are especially useful. The ethylenediaminetetraacetato iron III complexes are useful in both an independent bleaching solution and a combined bleach fix bath. The bleaching or the bleach fix bath can contain a bleach accelerating agent as described inU.S. Patents 3,042,520 and 3,241,966, Japanese PatentPublication Nos. 8506 70 and 8836 70, and so on, thiol compounds described in Japanese Patent Application O I No. 65732 78, and other various kinds of additives. Photographic emulsions employed In the present invention may be spectrally sensitized with methine dyes and others. Examples of useful sensitizing dyes are described in German Patent 929,080, U.S. Patents 2,493,748, 2,503,776, 2,519,001, 2,912,329, 3,656,959, 3,672,897 and 4,025,349, British Patent 1,242,588, andJapanese Patent Publication No. 14030 69. These sensitizing dyes may be employed solely or as a combination of two or more thereof. Combinations of sensitizing dyes are frequent ly employed or the purpose of supersensitization. Typical examples of supersensitizing combinations are described in U.S. Patents 2,688,545, 2,977,229, 3,397,06u, 3,522,052, 3,527,641, 3,617,293, 3,628,964, 3,666,480, 3,672,898, 3,679,428, 3,814,609 and ,026,707,British Patent 1,344,281, Japanese Patent PublicationNos. 4936 68 and 12375 83, Japanese Patent Application OPI Nos. 110618 77 and 109925 77, and so on. In the photographic materials prepared in accordance with the present invention, photographic emulsion layers and other layers are coated on a conventional flexible support such as a plastic film, paper, cloth or the like, or a rigid support such as glass, ceramic, metal or the like. Examples of flexible support which can be used to advantage include films made from semi synthetic or synthetic high molecular weight polymers such as cellulose nitrate, cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate butyrate, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene terephthalate, polycarbonate, etc and paper coated or laminated with a baryta layer or an a olefin polymer e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene, an ethylene butene copolymer, etc. Supports may be colored with dyes or pigments.Further, they may be rendered black for the purpose of shielding light. The surfaces of these supports are, in general, subjected to a subbing treatment to increase adhesiveness to photograpbdc emulsion layers. Before or after receiving the subbing treatment, the surfaces of the support may be subjected to a corona discharge treat ment, an ultraviolet irradiation treatment, a flame treatment, r so on. in the photographic materials prepared in accordance with the present invention, photographic emulsion layers and other layers can be coated on a support or ocher layers using conventional coating methods Examples of such coating methods include dip coating, roller coating, curtain coating, extrusion coating, and so on. The methods discloses in U.S. Patents 2,681,294, 2,761,791 and 3,526,528 can be used to advantage in coating such layers. The present invention can be applied to a multilayer multicolor photographic material having layers of at least two different spectral sensitivities on the support. A multilayer color photographic material usually has at least one red sensitive emulsion layer, at least one green sensitive emulsion layer and at least one blue sensitive emulsion layer on a support. The order of these ayers can be arbitrarily selected.It is general, however, to incorporate a cyan forming coupler in a. rca sensitive emulsion layer, a magenta forming coupler in a gr een sensitive emulsion layer, and a yellow forming coupler in a blue sensitive emulsion layer. However, different combinations may be used. The exposure for obtaining photographic image is carried out in a conventional manner. Any known light sources including natural light sunlight , a tungsten lamp, a fluorescent lamp, a mercury lamp, a xenon arc lamp, a carbon arc lamp, a xenon flash lamp, a CRT spot and so on can be employed for exposure. Suitable exposure times which can be used include not only exposure times commonly used in cameras ranging from about 1 1,000 to about 1 sec., but also exposure times shorter than 1 1,000 sec., for example, A 6 about 1 10 to about 1 106 sec. as with xenon flash lamps and cathode ray tubes. Exposure times longer than 1 second can also be used. The spectral distribution of the light employed for the exposure can be controlled using color filters, if desired. Laser beams can also oyed for exposure. Moreover, the emulsions of the present invention may also be exposed to light emitted from phosphorus excited by electron beams, X rays, y rays, a rays and the like. In the photographic emulsion layers of photographic materials prepared in accordance with the present invention, conventional color forming couplers, that is, compounds capable of forming colors by oxidative coupling with aromatIc primary amine developers e.g., phenylenediamine acrivatives, aminophenol derivatives, etc. in color development processing may be used in combination with the high reaction rate or low reaction rate coupler, or may be used independently of the high reaction rate or low reaction rate coupler by addition to a layer not containing the high reaction rate or low reaction rate coupler. Examples of conventional magenta couplers which can be used include 5 pyrazolone couplers, pyrazolobenzimidazole couplers, cyanoacetylcumarone couplers, openchain acylacetonitrile couplers and so on. Examples of conventional yellow couplers which can be used include acylacetamide couplers eg., benzoyl acetanilides, pivaloyl acetanilides, etc. , and so on. Examples of conventional cyan couplers which can be used include naphthoi couplers, phenol couplers, and so on. These couplers can provide desirable results when they have hydrophobic groups ballast groups in their molecules and are thereby rendered non diffusible. Thesis couplers may be equivalent or 2 equivalent.Moreover, they may be colored couplers having a color correcting effect, or couplers capable of releasing development restrainers with the progress of development conventional DIR couplers In addition to conventional DIR couplers, conventional colorless DIR coupling compounds which yield colorless products upon coupling and release development restrainers may be used.

Sample 203 This sample was prepared in the same manner asSample 101 except that an equimolar mole of Coupler D 3 was used in place of Coupler EX 2 in GL1 of the 6th layer, an equimolar mole of Coupler M l was used in place ofCoupler M in GL2 of the 7th layer, and the increase in sensitivity was corrected by reducing the mean grain size of the silver halide emulsion in GL2 of the 7th layer from 0.60 to 0.50 without changing the structure of the silver halide grains. When each of Samples 201 to 203 was wedgeexposed to white light and processed, Samples 201 and 203 caused a density reduction to some extent on the cyan image and the yellow image but showed almost the same sensitivity and gradation on the aimed magenta color image. About these samples, the granularity and the MTF value of each magenta image were measured, the results being shown in Table 3. As is clear from the results shown in Table 3, the magenta image of Sample 203 has excellent granularity from a low density portion to a high density portion and also shows a good MTF value, which shows the superior effects of this invention.
