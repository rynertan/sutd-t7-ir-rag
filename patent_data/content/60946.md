## Description
Animal feeding Apparatus.The invention relates to an animal feeding apparatus which mixes milk powder and water for feeding to animals only.When activated,the milk powder is augered out of the hopper, at the same time,water runs into the inside top rim of a funnel made of plastic material both powder and water then proceed from that point to a chamber where vigorous mixing takes place. The mix drops into an insulated container out of which come two or more flexible tubes that pass to the exterior of the apparatus these tubes are each connected to a rubber teat which are fitted to the side of the animals pen,allowing them to suck the mixture on an ad libitum basis.The hopper attachment and the motor table which houses the auger drive motor,mixer motor and water solenoid valve are easyly removable from each other and from the rest of the apparatus.Other animal feeding apparatus are known in accordance with prior art portion of claim I in which the water and milk powder are mixed in the same vessel from which the resulting liquid is withdrawn by means of a pipe connected to a teat.The hopper is not easily removable from the rest of the apparatus nor can the motor mixing the powder and water, the auger drive motor and water valve be removed from the apparatus as one unit. With an apparatus of this kind,hygenic conditions are difficult to maintain because the parts involved in the mixing and storage of milk are not easily detached for cleaning. This can cause a build up of harmful organisms which may adversly affect the health of the animals.The difficulty to remove the hopper,auger drive motor,mixer motor and water valve as one unit or separately from the rest of the apparatus,makes it more difficult to get these parts serviced regularly.The invention as claimed is intended to provide a remedy.It solves the problem of how to design an apparatus which is hygienic and easy to maintain in good working order,thereby averting the risks of disease to animals and machine malfunction.The advantages offered by the invention are mainly that the mixing of powder and water together with the storage of the resulting mixture in an insulated container,enable animals to draw liquid when and as required. The design of the mixer and insulated storage container,make them easily removable for cleaning.The modular construction of the hopper attachment and motor table1 ke it an extremly easy machine to service.So that the invention may be more clearly understood,reference will now be made to the accompanying drawings in which Figure I illustrates the mixing sequence.Figure 2 illustrates the water system of the invention and components situated in that one section of the cabinet.Figure 3 illustrates the hopper,motor table and insulated container with all attachments . riewres 4, 5 and 6 illustrate a more detailed view of the motor table and hopper base.The following text refers to Figure I. The mixing sequence is activated as follows the pressure switch I is de pressurised with the switch mechanism in a closed circuit situation this allows a IIO volt A.C supply in paralell to activate the solenoid valve 2,the auger drive motor 3 milk powder and the mixer motor 4.Powder is dispensed into the plastic funnel 5 by means of an auger 6 which lies at the bottom of the hopper.7 at the same time as the powder is being dispensed,warm water leaves the metal pipe 8 touching the inside top rim of the funnel 5 and causes the warm water to swirl round the interior of the said funnel 5.As the powder and water drop into the mixing chamber 9, a plastic paddle IO activated by the mixer motor 4, vigorously mixes the powder and water. The resulting mix drops into a plastic insulated container II by means of a flexible tube IS. iten the mix reaches its pre determined level, air pressure within the stainless steel tube I3 operates the pressure switch I thereby placing the switch mechanism in an open circuit situation and the mixing is stopped.The mix within the plastic insulated container 11 is drawn off by the animal by sucking at a teat I4 which is connected to the insulated container II by a flexible tube I5 at the end of which there is a non return valveI6.When the mix in the insulated container II drops below a pre set level,the pressure switch I is de pressurised and the sequence is re commenced.The following text refers to figure 2.Water,either from the mains Dr from a tank, enters the machine through a filter I7 nd proceeds to the outlet point I8. Water is held captive in a plastic tank I9 and as the water level rises,so zones a ball float 20 until the inlet valve 21 is closed thus preventing further water entering the tank I9. Ihe element heater 22 heats the water in the tank 9 to . temperature set by a ther mostat 23. An outlet pipe 24 takes the heated water to a solenoid valve Fig 1 2 . The pressure switch 25 is situated below the water tank and is fixed to the side of the tank support bracket.An overflow 25 a is incor porated to the water tank I9.The plastic water tank 19 has a lid 26 of the same material and tb one side of this lid 26 there is a small bracket 27 which has fastened to it a micro switch 28. To the arm 29 of the switch 28 is attached a thin metal rod 30 ,which penetrates the lid 26 and has a float 31 attached to its other end. If for any reason the water level in the tank I9 drops to a certain level above the water outlet poin 24, the switch 28 will break the power supply to the element heater 22, the circulation fan 32 and components 2, 3 and 4 in Figure I. The no water neon will light up on the instrument panel indicating that the water level in the tank I9 is below the required limit.Once the water levei in the tank I9 is back to normal, the float 31 rises,causin the arm 29 to put the switch to the on possition and reestablish normal electricity supply to the element heater 22,the circulation fan 32 and components 2,3 and 4 as shown in Figure 1. The following text refers to figure 3.The hopper 33 is secured to the metal motor table 34 by two brackets 35 placed either side of the hopper baseThe motor table 34 is secured to the metal cabinet on the inside by a screw through the slot 36 which fastens to a metal bracket 37. The metal bracket 37 is welded to the inside of the cabinet and serves to support and fasten the metal motor table 34.The hopper 33 and the motor table 34 may be lifted out of the metal cabinet,as one unit or separately simply by removing the two screws placed in the slots 36,disconecting the water supply to the solenoid valve 39 and removing the electrical connections to the auger drive motor Figure I item 3 ,mixer motor Figure I item 4 and solenoid valve Figure I,item 2 . pence this is done and the lid 38 to the cabinet is opened, the hopper 33 and the motor table 34, may be lifted out as one unit or separately.The screw on lid 40 has three or more perforations to it One perforation is to fit a stainless steel tube 42, the other fits a flexible delivery tube 43 and the remaining perforations,allow tubes 44 to enter the insulated container 41.The purpose of the insulated container 41 is to keep the mix warm. The stainless steel tube 42 has a rim which allows it to sit on the lid 40 while the greater part of its body remains in the insulated container 41.Just above the rim 45 is the neck 46 over which is tightly ., y fastened a clear flexible tube 47. The other end of this flexible tube 47 is tightly secured to the neck of the pressure switch Figure I, item I .The mix leaves the mixing chamber 48 via a plastic delivery tube 43 and is deposited in the plastic insulated container.The mix is drawn off at a teat 49,suction causes the mix to rise up the plastic tube 44 the mix can only travel in the direction of the teat 49 as the base of the plastic tubes 44 are each fitted with a non return valve 50.Once the tubes 44 and the stainless steel tube 42 have been removed from the insulated container 41, the mixing chamber 48 ,by means of a gentle outward pulling action, can be separated from its housing. This allows the operator to exchange the original set composing the funnel Figure item 61 ,the mixing chamber 48,delivery tube 43 and insulated plastic container 41, for a spare set of these which are provided with each machine. The following text refers to figure 4.The auger drive motor 56 is fastened to the motor table 52 by means of four screws.From the solenoid valve 59 there is a metal pipe 60 which touches the inside top rim of the funnel 61 The neck at the bottom of the funnel 6I fits tightly into the top section of the mixing chamber 62,allowing water and powder to pass into the chamber proper without restriction or loss to the exterior of powder and water from the funnel 61 and chamber 62.This cylindrical mixing chamber 62 fits onto a plastic housing 63 causing a seal. From out of the centre of the plastic housing 63, there extends a metal shaft 64 at the end of which there is a plastic paddle which revolves and serves to mix the powder with the water the plastic paidle is shown as item 65. A neck 66 serves to drain the Mi2 from mixing chamber 62. To this neck 66 there is fitted a hollow flexible tube 67 which conveys the mix to the plastic insulated container below.The following text refers to Figures 5 and 6.Figure 5 shows the motor table 52, two right angled brackets secured to the motor table 52. These two brackets 35 are equidistant from the centre of the auger drive shaft 55. On the motor table 52 there is a hole 53 which is equidistant from the similar point on both brackets 35.Figure 6 shows a drive fork 56 situated at the drive end of the auger the auger drive pin 54 Figure 5 locks into place with a drive fork 56.The locating pin 57 once firmly inserted in the locating hole 53,secures the hopper base 5I to the motor table 52.To release the hopper 5I from the motor table 52,all that is required is slight backward tilting motion of the hopper 51 so that the locating pin 57 is outside the locating hole 53. The hopper base SI can then move slightly forward and the fork 56 is freed from the drive pin 54.
