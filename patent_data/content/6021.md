A derailleur suitable for use in switching a drive chain between the sprockets of a multi speed sprocket, comprising a four member linkage mechanism A comprising a base member 1, first and second link members 2, 3 pivotally connected to said base member 1, and a movable member 4 connected to said link members 2, 3 so as to be reciprocably movable relative to the base member 1 and having a chain guide 5, a return biasing means 18 arranged for providing movement of the movable member 4 in a return direction and control wire engagement means 15 arranged for providing movement of the movable member 4 in a forward direction when a control wire 14 engaged therewith is pulled against the force of the return biasing means 18 in use of the derailleur. In order to prevent noise and interfering contact between the drive chain and a sprocket intended to be meshed with the movable member 4 is freely movable reciprocably within a limited predetermined range relative to the base member 1 without being subjected to the action of said return biasing means 18 whereby when the control wire 14 is pulled through a given stroke.
