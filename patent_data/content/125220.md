# Clamping device.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a clamping device, especially for clamping work tables, fixtures etc. to a base such as the machine table in a machine tool, comprising a holding means 2 having an enlarged head 4 and clamping means 8 which in the clamping position engage the head 4 of the holding means 2 and a clamping mechanism 7 which in its normal condition acts with its full clamping force against the clamp ing means but which unloads the clamping means when a disengagement force is applied thereto. In accordance with the invention the clamping means consist of clamping hooks 7 which are pivotable between a clamping position, in which they engage the head 4 of the holding means 2 , and a disengagement position, in which they completely disengage the head of the holding means, during simultaneous move ment thereof in a direction opposite the clamping direction, and reverse.
