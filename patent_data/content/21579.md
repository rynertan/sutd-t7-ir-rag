# Method and apparatus for the manufacture of plastics articles.

## Abstract
The manufacture of plastics products, in particular of board like articles from scrap or salvaged plastics materials, results by providing a mat of the raw material in particulate form, heating the mat to the softening point of the material by conveying it through an oven 4 . After that the mat is compressed between three rollers 10, 2, 8 arranged generally one above the other by being passed between the top and middle rollers 10, 2 , then between the middle and lower rollers 2, 8 , and then around the lower roller 8 to continue in the direction away from the oven, the middle and lower rollers being of substantially greater diameter than the upper roller 10 .
