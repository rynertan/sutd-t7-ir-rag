# Catalyst, method of manufacture, and method of catalytic oxidation of ethylene.

## Abstract
A catalyst is provided including reduced silver combined with at least one carbonate of the group consisting of the rare earth metals and yttrium, and at least one salt of an alkali or alkaline earth metal, wherein the carbonate is pre pared by the reaction of the appropriate chlorde with an alk ali carbonate or bicarbonate. The catalyst gives improved selectivity in the oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide.
