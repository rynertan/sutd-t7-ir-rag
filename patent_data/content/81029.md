# Improved jewelry retaining means including compensation means for dimensional variations in objects retained therein.

## Abstract
An improved frame 10 design for retaining a coin 40, medallion and other jewelry objects wherein a frame of one standard size can accommodate similarly shaped objects within a range of differing thicknesses. An improved shim 90 which allows a standard size frame to accommodate similarly shaped objects whose perimeter dimensions are small enough so that the object can move inside the frame. An improved retaining ring 50 which serves to impede the rotation of a circular object inside a cylindrical frame.
