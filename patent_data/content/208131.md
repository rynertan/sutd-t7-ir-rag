# Continuous Production of elastic polyesters.

## Abstract
An improvement in a process for producing an elastic polyester wherein a crystalline aromatic polyester and one or plurality of lactones are reacted, the improvement comprises by carrying out the reaction in a continuous process by continuously feeding the molten crystalline aromatic polyes ter and the lactones to a reaction vessel to subject them to addition polymerization, while continuously discharging a reaction mixture from the vesel to obtain the elastic polyes ter. Optionally, the reaction mixture can be further subjected to polycondensation in a molten state or a solid phase.
