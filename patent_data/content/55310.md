## Description
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR THE CONTINUOUS CASTING OF SILICON The present invention relates generally to a method and apparatus for the melting and casting of silicon and silicon containing materials, and is more particularly concerned with a method and apparatus for the continuous melting of silicon for use in semiconductor devices in order to reduce the time and expense associated with conventional melting and forming. While the present invention will be primarily discussed herein with reference to the melting of silicon for use in semiconductor type devices, particularly photovoltaic cells, it will be understood that the applicability of the present invention is not thereby so limited. In the conventional melting and forming of silicon for semiconductor use,it generally is the practice to charge a quartz vessel with pieces of silicon of various sizes and then heat the vessel under a protective gas blanket to a temperature sufficient to melt the silicon. The silicon is then formed into a monocrystalline rod by the Czochralski method, which is to seed the molten silicon and then slowly withdraw a formed rod from the molten silicon within the vessel. This method is generally quite timeconsuming and requires expensive processing equipment. We have previously proposed a method for forming silicon into a semicrystalline product in which method, silicon is melted within a melting vessel and then cooled under controlled conditions to produce a semicrystalline silicon product useful for the manufacture of photovoltaic cells.This method results in distinct cost advantages over theCzochralski method for producing silicon for photovoltaic cell uses. However, several problems are associated with the above method for producing semicrystalline silicon for use in semiconductor devices such as photovoltaic cells. One problem is that it is often difficult to control the heating of the silicon to a temperature just exceeding the melting point of silicon of 1410 C. In order to ensure that all of the silicon is melted, and because it is difficult o accurately control the heating of the vessel at such elevated temperatures often the silicon is heated to a temperature in excess of its melting point, e.g., the temperature of the silicon may reach 14500C or above.Such heating of the silicon may cause harmful stresses within the vessel used to contain the molten silicon, may cause undesirable reactions between the silicon and the vessel, and increases the time necessary for the total operation of melting and forming the silicon. In addition, because quartz and silicon have different coefficients of thermal contraction, upon solidification of the silicon it is a common occurrence for the vessel to crack or even break, thereby rendering the vessel unfit for further use. Quartz vessels for melting silicon are quite expensive, and as a consequence breakage of the vessels adds considerably to the overall cost of the semiconductor device made from silicon by conventional methods. We have now developed a method and apparatus for the melting of silicon, which significantly reduces the possibility for excessively heating the silicon and its associated melting vessel, which reduces the possibility of breakage of the melting vessel, and thereby reduces the cost of the melting operation, which can be performed in a continuous manner and in which vessels of a relatively inexpensive material can be utilized. Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for melting and casting silicon suitable for use as a host material for photovoltaic cells, comprising charging solid silicon into a melting vessel having an open drain therein, mrintaining the melting vestal at FulVstantiallv atmospheric pressure. applying heat to the solid silicon charge in the vessel so that initial portions thereof will be heated to a temperature above the melting point of silicon and become molten while other portions of the silicon charge remain in a solid state, allowing the molten silicon to pass through the drain out of the melting vessel without substantial obstruction at a temperature just above the melting point of the silicon, collecting the molten silicon in a receiving vessel at about said temperature so that the temperature of the collected silicon will be just above the melting point of silicon and the retention time of molten silicon in the melting vessel will be minimized, and solidifying the collected silicon in the receiving vessel. The present invention will be further described with reference to the accompanying drawing. In the drawing, the sole Figure is a cross sectional view of a vessel for containing molten silicon in accordance with the present invention. Referring now to the sole Figure of the drawing, apparatus 10 includes melting vessel 12, surrounding hgat source 20 and radio frequency coils 22. Vessel 12 in this embodiment is generally circular in shape and has a sloping bottom surface 14 with an open drain 16 therein. while quartz is generally the preferred material for vessel 12, the vessel may also be composed of considerably less expensive materials such as fired clay and the like, since contamination by impurities in such vesselmaterials is considerably reduced by the method of the present invention as will be explained hereinafter. Located beneath drain 16 of melting vessel 12 is receiving vessel 18 which collects molten silicon flowing from the drain. Like melting vessel 12, receiving vessel 18 may be of quartz, clay or like material. The method of melting silicon containing matexial utilizing apparatus 10 includes charging pieces or chunks of silicon into the vessel 12, and then heating the vessel and the contents by coils 22. The charge silicon may be refined silicon commonly referred to as poly , or metallurgical grade silicon having a greater amount of impurities than poly type silicon. While vessel 12 is being heated, silicon containing material is protected from undesirable chemical reactions by a non oxidizing protective gas blanket. As the silicon containing material reaches its melting point of about 14100 C., the silicon will melt and flow down to the bottom or vessel 12 and out drain 16 into receiving vessel 18 where it is allowed to solidify slowly e.g., in accordance with the process of my aforementioned application. The solidified body of semicrystalline silicon may then be sliced into wafers for manufacture into photovoltaic cells. Since, in this method, the silicon flows from the vessel as soon as it melts or shortly thereafter, any tendency for the silicon to be overheated is thereby significantly reduced. A further advantage of the present method and apparatus is that as the amount of silicon in the vessel 12 is reduced due to the melted material flowing out drain 16.further material can be charged into the vessel. Also, receiving vessel 18 can be removed and replaced by another empty receiving vessel after a predetermined quantity of molten silicon has flowed into the first vessel. Thus the method and apparatus of the present invention is adapted for the continuous casting of silicon. A single melting vessel 12 may therefore be used for the melting of a volume of silicon greatly in excess of its own volume. Moreover, since most if not all of the molten silicon will drain from vessel 12 upon completion of the casting cycle, the possibilities for vessel breakage due to solidification of silicon within the vessel during cooldown are significantly reduced if not eliminated. As was mentioned previously, quartz type vessels are at present almost exclusively used for the conventional melting of silicon so as to minimize contamination of the material by the vessel. However, the present invention allows the use of other materials such as clay for vessel 12 since the residence time for the molten silicon is generally of a too short duration to allow significant material contamination by any impurities contained within the vessel.For similar reasons, receiver vessel 18 may also be made of materials other than quartz. Of course, the use of other materials for vessels 12 and 18 may provide significant cost reductions in the melting and casting of silicon due to the inexpensiveness of these other materials.
