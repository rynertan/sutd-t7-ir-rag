# FM broadcasting system with transmitter identification by means of a binary phase modulated, differentially coded code signal.

## Abstract
FM broadcasting system comprising a FM transmitter 1 16, 32 34 and a receiver 14 31, 35, 36 cooperating therewith, the transmission signal of which comprises a multiplex signal which is frequency modulated on a main carrier wave, which multiplex signal comprises an audio frequency information signal L R and, in the case of a stereo transmission, a stereo information signal L R modulated on a 38 kC suppressed stereo subcarrier wave, also comprising a 19 kC stereo pilot which is situated between the frequency spectra of the two information signals and a binary, differentially coded code signal which is phase modulated on a 16.625 kC code subcarrier wave which is situated outside the said frequency spectra, and does not coincide with the 19 kC stereo pilot, the receiver 14 31, 35, 36 comprising a pilot regeneration circuit 22 25 for regenerating the 19 kC stereo pilot, the code signal having a bit repetition period which is an integral number of times the period of the 19 kC stereo pilot. The signal delay Ï„ required for differentially decoding the code signal is stabilized by means of a clock signal derived from the 19 kC stereo pilot, use then being made of the fixed frequency relationship between the bit frequency of the code signal and the stereo pilot frequency, so that disturbances due to variations in the signal delay are avoided.
