# A structure for vibration isolation in an apparatus with a vacuum system.

## Abstract
An apparatus with a vacuum system, said vacuum system including a vacuum chamber 11 adapted to contain main instruments of the apparatus, and an exhaust device 12 adapted to exhaust air from the vacuum chamber 11 , which apparatus comprises a structure for vibration isolation adapted to prevent the transmission of the vibration of the exhaust device 12 to main section of the apparatus, in which structure said exhaust device 12 comprises a bellows 26 connected with the vacuum chamber 11 , an exhaust tube 27 connected with the bellows 26 and a vacuum pump 28 attached to the exhaust tube 27 and the vacuum pump 28 are arranged to construct a pendulum system in which the bellows 26 is adopted for a fulcrum, whereby the vibrations of the vacuum pump 28 are absorbed by the pendulumn system and do not reach the main section of the apparatus.
