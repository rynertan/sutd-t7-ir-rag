# Method and apparatus for manufacturing a printed plastics cover.

## Abstract
The raised edge part 3 of a deep drawn plastics cover is printed by pressing a carrier 13 of a resilient deformable material, carrying a colouring composition, against said edge part 3. An apparatus for performing the method comprises a deformable carrier 13 or 8a, 8b, for carriyng a colouring composition. The carrier 8a, 8b is integral with a cylindri cal part 7 being connected with a first cylinder 6 and two concentric cylinders 9 and 10, positioned around said first cylinder at either side thereof, deform annular parts 8a, 8b of resilient material and press the annular parts 8a, 8b against the edge part 3, when on the one hand first cylin der 6 and on the other hand the two concentric cylinders 9 and 10, are moved with respect to each other. The colouring composition may also be carried by a layershaped carrier material 13.
