# Method of making a polysilicon resistor with low thermal activation energy.

## Abstract
A method of fabricating a resistor in polysilicon and a semiconductor element suitable for use as a load resistor in a static memory. In the method, after the polysilicon has been doped, the device is annealed by exposing it to a rapid increase of ambient temperature up to between 900 and 1200 C , maintaining the high ambient temperature for a controlled time about 5 seconds and then lowering the ambient temperature at a rapid rate. This decreases resist ance by one order of magnitude and significantly decreases the temperature activation energy of the resistor. This permits static memory cells to retain data even through the cell has high leakage currents, thereby improving final test yields.
