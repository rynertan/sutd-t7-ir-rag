# Thermal dot matrix printer and method of operating same.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus are described for improving the printing speed of a dot matrix printer. The printer com prises a conventional array of printing elements and a print ing element addressing matrix comprising a set of address lines and a set of strobe lines. Each printing element is connected in series between one of said address lines and one of said strobe lines. Each address line is connected to the output of a first register, and each strobe line to the output of a second register. The printer further comprises means for generating a set of signals representative of a dot matrix pattern to be made on said recording medium, said set of signals being organized in successive sequences each of which contains the signals which control the appli cation of a voltage to the address lines connected to the same printing elements as one of the strobe lines means for applying the signals of each said sequence in turn to the inputs to said first registers in one or more parallel opera tions, and means for reading the signals of each said se quence from said first registers in one or more parallel operations while a voltage is applied to one of said strobe lines from said second register.
