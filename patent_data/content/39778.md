# Curved reflector with adjustable focal length.

## Abstract
A curved reflector 10 of electro magnetic radiation formed of an elastic, reflective membrane 14 which utilizes a partial vacuum to provide the curvature to the membrane 14 and an adjustable valve 20 to vary such curvature, and there fore the focal length of the reflector 10 . The valve 20 com prises a central aperture in the membrane 14 and a body adjustably mounted above the aperture with a flow restricting surface thereon which overlies the aperture.
