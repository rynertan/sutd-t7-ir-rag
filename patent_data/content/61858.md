# Intraocular lens.

## Abstract
An intraocular lens structure utilizing a lens 12 which may be placed against the posterior side of the iris 35 and adapted for covering at least a portion of the pupil 41 . The structure includes a first position fixation element 13 connected to the lens 12 which extends away from the same to the periphery of the iris 35 for engagement in the posterior chamber 34 . A second position fixation element 17 connected to the lens includes a first position 18 which extends axially away from the lens intended for passing through the pupil 41 into the anterior chamber 33 and an end portion 20 which extends to the periphery of the iris 35 in the anterior chamber 33 and engages the same. The end portions of the first and second position fixation elements 13, 17 are respectively held in the capsular 36, 36a or ciliary sulcus 38 inferiorly and in the anterior chamber angle 33 superiorly at the scleral spur 50 .
