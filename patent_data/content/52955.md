# Aerofoil sail.

## Abstract
An aerofoil sail has a rigid main panel 10 pivotally mounted to a hull 17 about a vertical axis 15 with trailing flap means 12A hinged 14 to one side of the main panel. The trailing flap means comprises a series of separate flaps 12A , 12A , 12A individually settable so that the angle of incidence can differ α, β at different levels on the sail. Alternatively, a single trailing flap can be torsionally flexible so that the angle of incidence can differ along its length. In a preferred form flap means 12A, 12B are provided at opposite edges of main panel 10 and can be alternatively folded in to give a reversible aerofoil section.
