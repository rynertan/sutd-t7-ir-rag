# Signed document transmission system.

## Abstract
On the transmitting side, a signature corresponding to a document to be transmitted is generated using a random num ber and the document as variables and on the basis of a con gruence polynomial of second or higher degree with respect to the random number, secret key information and public key in formation produced based on the secret key information. The signature and the document are transmitted in digital form. On the receiving side, the congruence polynomial is operated us ing the received signature and document in place of the ran dom number and the document employed on the transmitting side, and the validity of the received signature and document is verified on the basis of the result of operation and the public key information.
