## Description
METHOD OF PREPARING A MY COPLAS MA FREE HEPATOMA CELL LINEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Human hepatoma cell lines which shed hepatitisB surface antigen HBsAg are known. See for example,Alexander et al., South African J. Med. Sic., 41 2 89 98, 1976 MacNab et al., Br. J. Cancer 1976 34 509 515 and Alexander et al., South African Med.J. 1976 pages 2124 2128. A problem with such cell lines, however, is that they contain mycoplasma. Mycoplasma are undesirable as they are a contaminant to tissue culture and also because they may affect cell growth and yields.OBJECTS OF ThE INVENTION It is, accordingly, an object of the present invention to provide a method for irradicating the mycoplasma contamination from a hepatoma cell line.Another object is to provide a mycoplasma free hepatoma cell line. These and other objects of the present invention will become apparent from the following description. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A hepatoma cell line which sheds HBsAg and which is free of mycoplasma is obtained by injecting an immuno suppresed mammalian species with cells from the hepatoma cell line and thereafter isolating cells from tumors which develop subsequently in the mammalian species.DETAILED DESCRIPTION Any human hepatoma cell line which shedsHBsAg may be used in carrying out the present invention. A specific and preferred example of such a cell line is Alexander cells, a culture of which has been deposited with American Type Culture Collection,Bethesda, Maryland, U.S.A., under accession numberCCL 8024. According to the present invention, cells from the human hepatoma cell line which sheds HBsAg are injected intradermally or subcutaneously s.c into an immunosuppressed mammalian species and cells from a resulting tumor are grown in cell culture to form a mycoplasma free cell line. While any mammalian species may be employed, preferred species are readily obtainable laboratory animals which are small in size, easily handled, and economical. Examples of preferred mammalian species are guinea pigs, hamsters, mice, rabbits and rats. The mammalian species selected has either a naturally or artificially induced defective immune system.Thus, the mammalian species may be a genetically immunodeficient animal, e.g. nude nu nu mice. Alternatively the immuno suppression may be effected by radiation, e.g. by x ray or cobalt 60, or chemically, e.g. by use of cyclophosphamide plus anti thymocyte serum ATS . The isolated tumor cells may be grown in cell culture under conditions described in the article by MacNab et al., op. cit., and in the articles byAlexander et al., op. cit. The resulting cell line is free of mycoplasma but is otherwise morphologically identical to the original HBsAg shedding human hepatoma cell line. The following examples illustrate the present invention without, however, limiting the same thereto. EXAMPLE 1 Cell culture fluids from a human hepatoma cell line Alexander cells PLC PRF 5, ATCC CCL 8024 culture are placed directly on agar medium with and without filtering through a 0.22 micron filter. In addition, culture fluids are incubated 370C in a mycoplasma enrichment broth for 10 days and then plated onto agar.The agar cultures are incubated at 370C both aerobically and anareobically in a moist atmosphere. After at least 10 days incubation, the cultures are examined for the presence of mycoplasma based on microscopic observation of colony morphology, resistance of the colonies to scraping and the reaction of the colonies to dienes stain. All cell fluids are found to be positive for mycoplasma. EXAMPLE 2 Alexander cells are grown in plastic flasks using Eagle s Minimum Essential Medium EMEM , supplemented with 10 fetal calf serum, L glutamine 2mM , and Neomycin 50 WgJml . The cells are cultured in the presence of 10 Wg ml of tetracycline, removed from the cultured flasks with 0.25 trypsin, centrifuged, and resuspended at 107 cells ml. Five hamsters are anesthetized and 0.1 ml of cell suspension 106 cells is injected into the tissue of each cheek pouch to form a bleb. Fifteen mice are injected intradermally on their abdominal surface with the same amount 6 cells in 0.1 ml . The mice are injected subcutaneously on day 1 with 0.4 ml of anti thymocyte serum ATS and 0.2 ml ATS daily for the remainder of the experiment except for days 5, 6, 12 and 13.On days 3, 4, 8, and 9 each hamster is given 5 Wg animal and each mouse is given 1.25 wg of oral tetracycline. On day 16, all of the animals are examined for tumors. All are negative. This experiment shows that ATS alone is inadequate to induce complete immuno suppression. EXAMPLE 3 Twelve mice are each given 3.0 mg of cyclophosphamide intraperitoneally i.p. , and 75 minutes later are intradermally injected with 4 X 106 hepatoma cells on the abdominal surface. The mice are given ATS according to the following schedule. Day 1 0.2 ml, i.p. 3 0.4 ml, s.c, plus 0.5 ml, i.p. 6 0.5 ml, i.p. 7 0.5 ml, i.p.On day 8, three mice have apparent tumors. They are given 1.0 ml, i.p. in 2 doses 6 hours apart on both day 8 and day 9. On day 14 all three mice still have apparent tumors. The tumor from one mouse is excised aseptically, dispersed by mincing with a scissors, and trypsinized successively for 15 and 20 minutes. The cells are pooled and planted into plastic flasks and cultured under usual culture conditions 5 CO2 and 95 relative humidity with Minimum Essential Medium,Eagle EMEM , 10 fetal calf serum fcs and 50 Wg ml neomycin. No living cells are detected in the cultures examined over the next 6 days. The remaining 2 mice are treated as follows Day 14 0.5 ml ATS, i.p. 15 0.5 ml ATS, i.p. 16 0.5 ml ATS, i.p. 17 0.75 ml ATS, i.p. 20 0.75 ml ATS, i.p. On day 20, one tumor appears to b regressing the other is getting larger. Day 21 0.75 ml ATS i.p. 22 0.75 ml ATS i.p.On day 23, the prominent tumor measures about 1 cm in diameter and protrudes about 4 mm from the abdomen. It is excised aspetically, dispersed by mincing with a scissors, and trypsinized twice for 30 minutes. The cells dispersed from the two trypsinizations are separately planted in plastic flasks in growth medium EMEM, 10 fcs, 50 Wg ml neomycin . Both cultures grow into monolayers. The cells from the first trypsinization are subsequently lost to mold contamination. The cells from the second trypsinization continue to grow well and are expanded into multiple cultures. No mycoplasma is detected in any of the cultures. EXAMPLE 4 Culture of tissue fluids from Alexander cell cultures on PPLO agar medium results in easily detected mycoplasma colonies after about 8 days, whether incubated aerobically or anaerobically at 370C. The cell culture fluids derived from the third mouse tumor in Example 3 are cultured repeatedly in parallel toAlexander cell culture fluids as controls and are consistently negative for mycoplasma colonies.
