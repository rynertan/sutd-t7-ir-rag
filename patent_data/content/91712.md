## Abstract
A method and an arrangement for the processing of a meterial web to convert the same to individual packing containers filled with contents. Flexible packing containers for milk or other beverages are manufactured from tubular material which is filled with contents, formed and divided to packing containers with the help of alternatively working forming and sealing jaws which are given a reciprocating movement on the one hand in longitudinal direction of the tube, on the other hand in transverse direction of the tube. In accordance with the invention the jaws are guided as well as driven by means of guiding and driving rods which run parallel with the material tube and to which different reciprocating movements are imparted.
