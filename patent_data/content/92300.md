# Tip configuration for a ligating clip applier.

## Abstract
A multiple clip applier including a handle and a car tridge which holds a large number of ligating clips and which snaps into a cartridge receiving channel on the handle. The handle operates like an elongated scissors with scissors handles at one end and jaws at the other to which clips may be delivered in rapid succession. Opening and closing the scissors handles operates the mechanism of the handle to open and close the jaws and to provide a long stroke motion for delivering clips from the end of the car tridge to the nose section. Clips may be indexed through the cartridge by reciprocating parts of the cartridge with respect to one another with a short stroke cocking motion captured from the long stroke delivery motion from a cooperating slot and pin mechanism. These two motions are accomplished within the envelope of motion of the normal opening and closing of the scissors handles to operate the jaws of the ap plier and to feed and index clips from the cartridge to the nose. The mechanism of the present invention permits the overall shape of the handle to be small, compact and readily adaptable for use even deep in an incision site.
