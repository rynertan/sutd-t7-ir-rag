# Copper nickel tin cobalt spinodal alloy.

## Abstract
The ductility and electrical conductivity of an age hard ened spinodally decomposed copper nickel tin alloy can be im proved, without detracting from the alloy s strength proper ties, by partially substituting nickel by cobalt. The alloy consists essentially of nickel from 5 to 30 wt tin from 4 to 13 wt cobalt from 3,5 to 7 wt copper balance.
