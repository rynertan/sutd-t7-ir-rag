## Abstract
A method and apparatus for continuously detecting and monitoring the hydrocarbon dew point of a gas. A gas sample is supplied to a dew point detector the temperature of a portion of the sample gas stream to be investigated is lowered progressively prior to detection until the dew point is reached the presence of condensate within the flowing gas is detected and subsequently the supply gas sample is heated to above the dew point the procedure of cooling and heating the gas stream continuously in a cyclical manner is repeated.
