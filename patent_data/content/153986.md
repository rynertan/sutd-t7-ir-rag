# A signum signal generator.

## Abstract
The detector comprises an input terminal 94 for receiving a signal sine f t . A second terminal 96 couples the Hilbert transform of this signal to a phase inverting switch 90 and also to a zero crossing detector 97 . The detector is coupled to one input of an AND gate 104 . A third terminal 106 provides a signal from a decoder 38 to a full wave rectifier 108 . The rectified output is coupled to a differentiator 110 and to an adder 112 . The output of the adder is applied to a one shot multivibrator 114 , the output of which is coupled to a second input of the AND gate. The output of the AND gate represents only those zero crossings in the output of the detector 97 which coincide closely with the zero crossings of the signal at the third terminal. The output of the AND gate is applied to a flipflop 118 which controls the phase inverting switch.
