# In axle vehicle wheel speed sensing device.

## Abstract
A wheel speed sensor comprises a non magnetic spindle 6 , a rotor 8 of magnetic material carried by the spindle, a stator 3 surrounding the rotor, a permanent magnet 4 , a stationary hub 7 of magnetic material in which the spindle is rotatably mounted, and a wire coil 5 disposed for induction by current by changing magnetic fields caused by rotation of the rotor. The rotor 8 and the hub 7 are superimposed over the total length of the rotor, irrespective of the relative axial positions of the rotor and the hub due to the end float of the spindle 6 . This ensures that the effective length of an air gap 9 between the overlapping faces of the rotor 8 and the hub 7 remains substantially constant irrespective of any such end float. Thus the resistance of a magnetic flux path across the air gap will remain substantial ly constant.
