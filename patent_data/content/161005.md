# Novel squarium compounds, process for preparing the same and electrophotographic photoreceptors containing the same.

## Abstract
Novel squarium compounds which have a flat photosen sitivity in the wide range from visible ray region to the near infrared ray region as a charge generator and which can be prepared by reacting squaric acid and an aniline derivative, and electrophotographic photoreceptors containing the squarium compounds are disclosed.
