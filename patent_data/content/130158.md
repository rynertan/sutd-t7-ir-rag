# Sealing device in a cylinder drier.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a sealing device in a cylinder drier, intended for incorporation in a paper machine and including a plurality of cylinders arranged in two substantially parallel rows 1a, 1b , the paper web 2 being trained serpen tine about said cylinder during drying, said web being carried by an endless porous Fourdrinier drier 3 adapted for pres sing the web against the cylinder surfaces in one row of cylinders and situated between the paper web and the cylin der surfaces in the other row. Two shielding members 7, 15 being disposed in the space restricted by the wire and an intermediate cylinder surface on that cylinder which the wire and the web come onto and leave. Said shielding members facing the wire and extending substantially in parallel with and close to the wire and over the entire width of the web. The end portion of each shielding member being free and extend ing into the area for the nip between the wire and the inter mediate cylinder, whereas the opposite end portion is con nected to a blowing box 10, 14 provided with openings for blowing air in directions which are substantially in parallel with or form a certain angle to the wire, said air jets being directed in the opposite direction relative to the correspond ing shielding member.
