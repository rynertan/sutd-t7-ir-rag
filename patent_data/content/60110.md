# Environmental control system.

## Abstract
An environmental control system comprises a non reverse cycle heat pump having means 3 for selectively extracting heat from a heat store 12 and from at least one other source including an air stream, means 10, 11 for selectively rejecting the extracted heat to provide heated environmental space air and to increase the heat content of the store and control means for selecting the sources and uses of the extracted heat in accordance with prevailing conditions and arranged so that when available heat is preferentially extracted from the air source. The airstream from which heat is to be extracted and the air to be heated may be space air or fresh air or a mixture of the two.
