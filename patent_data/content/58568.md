# Photosensitive elements and methods for producing them.

## Abstract
The photosensitive silver halide grains carried on a support are provided in a substantially predetermined spaced array, for instance of single grains separate from one another. The element may be made by providing a substan tially predetermined spaced array of sites at which the grains may be provided preferentially, and providing the grains. The sites are preferably made by a method comprising exposing a photosensitive material to actinic radiation in a pattern that is related to the array of sites, preferably an interference pattern, and developing the exposed material.
