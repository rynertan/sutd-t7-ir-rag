In a still further aspect the invention provides a method as defined above wherein R¹ is C₁ ₄ alkyl and R² is optionally substituted phenyl, especially halophenyl and particularly chlorophenyl. When R¹ is alkyl it can be a straight or branched chain group having 1 to 6, e.g. 1 to 4, carbon atoms examples are methyl, ethyl, propyl The compounds of the invention can contain chiral centres. Such compounds are generally obtained in the form of racemic mixtures. However, these and other mixtures can be separated into the individual isomers by methods known in the art. Examples of suitable substituents for the phenyl and for the phenyl moiety of the benzyl are halogen e.g. fluorine, chlorine or bromine , C₁ ₅ alkyl e.g. methyl, ethyl, propyl n or In a further aspect, therefore, the invention provides a method as defined above wherein R¹ and R² are both halophenyl and preferablyone wherein R¹ and R², which may be the same or different, are each chlorophenyl or fluorophenyl. Furthermore in another aspect the invention provides a method as defined above wherein at least one phenyl ring also bears one or more alkoxy groups, and, for example, R¹ may be 2 chloro 4 methoxyphenyl when R² is 2 chloro, 2 fluoro, 4 chloro or 4 fluoro phenyl.

Routine tests may be necessary to determine the best rate of application of a specific compound for any specific material for which it is suitable. The compounds may be used as such but are more conveniently formulated into compositions for such usage. The compounds can be applied in a number of ways, for example they can be applied formulated or unformulated, directly to the material or they can be sprayed on, dusted on or applied as a cream or paste formulation, or they can be applied as a vapour. Application can be to any part of the material and can be preventative, protectant, proplylactic and eradicant treatments. The compounds are preferably used in the form of a composition. The type of composition used in any instance will depend upon the particular purpose envisaged. The compositions may be in the form of dusting powders or granules comprising the active ingredient and a solid diluent or carrier, for example fillers such as kaolin, bentonite, kieselguhr, dolomite, calcium carbonate, talc, powdered magnesia, Fuller s earth, gypsum, Hewitt s earth, diatomaceous earth and China clay. Such granules can be preformed granules suitable for application to the soil without further treatment. These granules can be made either by impregnating pellets of filler with the active ingredient or by pelleting a mixture of the active ingredient and powdered filler. Compositions may comprise an agent for example a mineral oil for assisting the adhesion of the composition to the material alternatively the active ingredient can be formulated for material dressing purposes using an organic solvent for example N methylpyrrolidone or dimethylformamide . The compositions may also be in the form of dispersible powders, granules or grains comprising a wetting agent to facilitate the disperion in liquids of the powder or grains which may contain also fillers and suspending agents. The aqueous dispersions or emulsions may be prepared by dissolving the active ingredient s in an organic solvent optionally containing wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agent s and then adding the mixture to water which may also contain wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agent s . Suitable organic solvents are ethylene dichloride, isopropyl alcohol, propylene glycol, diacetone alcohol, toluene, kerosene, methylnaphthalene, the xylenes, trichloroethylene, furfuryl alcohol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, and glycol ethers e.g. 2 ethoxyethanol and 2 butoxyethanol . The compositions to be used as sprays may also be in the form of aerosols wherein the formulation is held in a container under pressure in the presence of a propellant, e.g. fluorotrichloromethane or dichlorodifluoromethane. The compounds can be mixed in the dry state with a pyrotechnic mixture to form a composition suitable for generating in enclosed spaces a smoke containing the compounds. Alternatively, the compounds may be used in a micro encapsulated form. By including suitable additives, for example additives for improving the distribution, adhesive power and resistance to rain on treated surfaces, the different compositions can be better adapted for various utilities. The compositions may also be in the form of liquid preparations for use as dips or sprays which are generally aqueous dispersions or emulsions containing the active ingredient in the presence of one or more surfactants e.g. wetting agent s , dispersing agent s , emulsifying agent s or suspending agent s . These agents can be cationic, anionic or non anionic agents. Suitable cationic agents are quaternary ammonium compounds, for example cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. Suitable anionic agents are soaps, salts of aliphatic monoesters of sulphuric acid for example sodium lauryl sulphate , and salts of sulphonated aromatic compounds for example sodium dodecylbenzenesulphonate, sodium, calcium or ammonium lignosulphonate, butylnaphthalene sulphonate, and a mixture of sodium diisopropyl and triisopropyl naphthalene sulphonates . Suitable non ionic agents are the condensation products of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols such as oleyl or cetyl alcohol, or with alkyl phenols such as octyl or nonyl phenol and octylcresol. Other non ionic agents are the partial esters derived from long chain fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, the condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, and the lecithins. Suitable suspending agents are hydrophilic colloids for example polyvinylpyrrolidone and sodium carboxymethylcellulose , and the vegetable gums for example gum acacia and gum tragacanth . The compositions for use as aqueous dispersions or emulsions are generally supplied in the form of a concentrate containing a high proportion of the active ingredient s , the concentrate to be diluted with water before use. These concentrates often should be able to withstand storage for prolonged periods and after such storage be capable of dilution with water in order to form aqueous preparations which remain homogenous for a sufficient time to enable them to be applied by conventional spray equipment. The concentrates may conveniently contain up to 95 , suitably 10 85 , for example 25 60 , by weight of the active ingredient s . These concentrates suitably contain organic acids e.g. alkaryl or aryl sulphonic acids such as xylene sulphonic acid or dodecylbenzenesulphonic acid since the presence of such acids can increase the solubility of the active ingredient s in the polar solvents often used in the concentrates. The concentrates suitably contain also a high proportion of surfactants so that sufficiently stable emulsions in water can be obtained. After dilution to form aqueous preparations, such preparations may contain varying amounts of the active ingredient s depending upon the intended purpose, but an aqueous preparation containing 0.0005 or 0.01 to 10 by weight of active ingredient s may be used. The compositions of this invention can comprise also other compound s having biological activity, e.g. compounds having similar or complementary fungicidal or activity or compounds having insecticidal activity.
