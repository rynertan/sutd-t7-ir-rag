# Spin tuned magnetron.

## Abstract
A spin tuned magnetron includes a spinner 3 which interacts with a magnetron cavity to modulate its fre quency of oscillation. The spinner runs in bearings 8, 9 around a shaft 7 . The lives of the bearings are a control ling factor in the life of the magnetron. The outer races OR are fixed in position relative to each other and to the spinner by spacers 13, 14 and a spring 15 arranged between an abutment 11 and a circ lip 12 on the spinner. The inner races IR are arranged to be moveable relative to each other and to the shaft by vir tue of spacers 10 and 17 , a spring 16 between the inner races, and a further spring 18 . A pole piece nose 4 is arranged to be screwed down on the shaft to compress the springs 16 and 18 to provide a desired amount of axial float on the spinner. By setting the axial float the bearing load can be shared as desired and thus increase the lives of the bearings.
