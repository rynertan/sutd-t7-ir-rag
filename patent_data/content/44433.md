# Method of casting synthetic materials.

## Abstract
Insertion to be applied in the pouring of synthetic material in several layers, especially layers of epoxy resin under machine components, consisting of one or several distance pieces 1 of a total extent equalling the distance between foundation and machine component, and further of a number of perpendicularly hereon situated discs 2 the number of which equals the number of pouring layers, and placed at intervals equalling the thickness of the layers. The distance piece situated nearest to the foundation can consist of a spring 3 . When the first layer is poured up to and covering the first disc, the said disc will during the hardening absorb occuring dynamics, and when the next layer is poured both the first and the second disc will absorb this force, and so on. It will thus be possible to pour very thick layers without any risk of crimping.

## Claims
PATENT CLAIMS 1. Insertion to be applied in the pouring of synthetic materials especially epoxy resin in several layers and in particular for the pouring under machine components, c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n t h a t the insertion is made up of one or several distance pieces to a total extent equalling the distance between foundation and machine component, and in that perpendicular on the distance pieces are placed discs in a number equal to the number of pourings, and at an interval equal to the thickness of the individual layers. 2. Insertion according to Claim 1 c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n t h a t the distance pieces being tube sections of an extent equalling the individual pouring layers and having the discs placed between the tube sections. 3. Insertion according to Claims 1 and 2 c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n t h a t the distance pieces situated nearest to the foundation constitute a spring. 4. Insertion according to Claims 2 and 3 c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n t h a t inside the tube sections, discs and spring is inserted a non metallic key pin.

## Description
The invention relates to an insertion to be applied in the pouring of synthetic materials in several layers for the prevention of crimping.By the pouring of synthetic materials especially epoxy resin in several layers there is a risk of crimping of the individual layers during hardening. This has during many years caused noticeable problems, especially in case of pouring under machine components. Remedies by way of embedding metal bolts or scraps or the like have been attempted, but with poor effect.It is the object of the invention to devise an insertion to be applied in the pouring of synthetic materials especially epoxy pourings for the elimination of the said inconveniences. This is according to the invention achieved by means of insertions designed as specified in Claim 1.For the use of the described insertion the first layer is poured out until the first disc has been fully covered.When this layer hardens the said disc will on account of its horizontal extent perpendicularly on the distance piece prevent the layer from crimping, as it will absorb all the dynamic in the epoxy parallel with the distance piece. When the second layer is poured until disc number two is covered, the discs 1 and 2 will absorb the dynamic effect arising during the hardening of the second layer.Continuing in this manner and by adapting the number of distance pieces and discs to the number of layers preferred it will be possible to pour arbitrarily thick layers without any risk of crimping.An especially advantageous embodiment of the insertion is specified in Claim 2. By designing the distance pieces as tube sections and place the discs between them, the discs will as a matter of course absorb the great dynamic effect, appearing during the hardening. It will furthermore offer the advantage of allowing adaptation of the insertions to the mounting place following a given distance. To facilitate the mounting procedure the insertion can be designed as specified in Claim 3. The mounting will then be effected by compressing the spring and pushing the insertion into the proper position.When the distance piece nearest to the foundation can be a spring, it is because this distance piece is not affected by the upward going force, which will only be absorbed by the superjacent tube sections and discs.To lighten the task of mounting further, a key pin made of e.g. wood can be inserted inside tube sections, discs or spring as specified in Claim 4.The drawing shows an insertion according to the invention in which Fig. 1 shows an embodiment of a three layer pouring Fig 2 shows another embodiment of two layer pouring, and Fig 3 shows a section A A of Figure 1. The insertion consists in a simple form,as shown in the drawing of Figure 2, of 1 distance piece 1 , 1 disc 2 , 1 spring 3 and 1 key pin 4 . Distance piece, disc and spring are placed,with the key pin inserted,perpendicularly betwEen machine component and foundation. Figure 1 shows an embodiment intended for a three layer pouring, in the said case applying 2 distance pieces 1 , 2 discs 2 , 1 spring 3 and 1 key pin 4 . Figure 3 shows by way of a section A A of Figure 1 in which manner the key pin is situated in the insertion.For further explanation of the description is enclosed a model of the invention showing an insertion for a three layer pouring partly embedded in epoxy resin.
