# Liquid crystal apparatus.

## Abstract
A liquid crystal apparatus comprising a nematic curvi linearly aligned phases liquid crystal material 20 located between two electrodes 13,14 wherein a control element 17 is incorporated into the electrodes 13,14 . The elec trodes may also form a circuit means integral therewith for selectively applying an electric field across the liquid crystal material 20 .
