# Improved hair waving and straightening compositions of matter.

## Abstract
Hair waving and straightening compositions comprise a sulfite and or bisulfite reducing system, urea in amount of at least 10 by weight, a cationic polyquaternary having conductivity, when measured at 0.1 by weight concentra tion, from 225 mhos to 25 mhos, in an amount of at least 0.07 by weight, the composition having a pH in the range of 5.5 to 8.5. the cationic polyquaternary resin in combination with the urea in the reducing system produces a hair waving and or straightening effect equivalent to conventional thio glycolate systems without the attendant unpleasant odours associated with the thioglycolate systems. The reducing system is less damaging to the hair and skin than the thioglycolate systems. The system may be used either with or without heat such as heat from hair dryers. Such hair waving and straightening compositions may contain any conventional additives employed in the known sulfite and or bisulfite systems e.g. wetting agent, fragrance compounds, coloring agents, thickening agents, opacifying agents, se questering agents, solubilizing agents, conditioning agents, etc. . The compositions are used in conjunction with conven tional neutralizing compositions used for conventional hair waving compositions.

## Description
IMPROVEI HAIR WAVING AND STRAIGIlTENING COMPOSITIONS OF MATTER It is well known that hair waving and straightening compositions containing thioglycolate as the reducing agent are very effective in the waving and straightening of hair. For example, when used in hair waving compositions, thioglycolate compounds give excellent curl tightness characteristics to the hair. Such compositions have had substantial commercial acceptance. Illustrative of such compositions are those disclosed in US A 2,717,228 US A 3,847,165 US A 2,631,965 US A 2,615,828 US A 2,836,185 and US A 3,071,515. The thioglycolate hair waving and straightening compositions, however, have certain drawbacks associated therewith. First of all such compositions have a very unpleasant odour and, therefore, are troublesome to the consumer for use at home. Also, if used improperly on the hair or too often, such compositions present a possible risk of hair damage because of their effect on the physical properties of hair. Another type of hair waving and straightening composition which has had substantial commercial acceptance are those hair treating compositions containing sulfite and bisulfite salts e.g. ammonium or alkali metal like sodium salts as the reducing agent. For the sake of convenience such compositions will be referred to herein as the sulfite bisulfite systems. While the sulfite bisulfite systems do not have the unpleasant odour associated with the thioglycolate systems, when used for waving hair, they do not impart to the hair the same curl tightness imparted by the thioglycolate systems. Examples of known sulfite bisulfite systems are those disclosed in US A 2,836,185 US A 3,864,476 US A 4,296,764 and US A 3,912,808 as well as BelgianPatents 895,854 and 892,348. In the US A 3,912,808 there is diclosed a hair straightening composition Example 1 containing a hisulfite reducing system containing urea and a cationic quaternary polymer as a hair conditioner. In this patent the cationic resin is disclosed as a conditioning agent and not as an essential ingredient which will promote or enhance permanent waving or hair straightening. An object of this invention is to provide novel compositions of matter which will promote waving and straightening of the hair in an efficient manner similar to that obtained with thioglycolate systems but which are free of the unpleasant odour associated with the thioglycolate systems as well as offering a lower risk of hair damage than is offered by thioglycolate systems. Another object of this invention is to provide improved sulfite and or bisulfite systems for the waving and straightening of hair. A still further object of this invention is to provide improved sulfite and or bisulfite hair waving compositions which give excellent hair curl characteristics. It has been found that the object of this invention may be realized by combining with a known sulfite and or bisulfite reducing agent, urea, a known hydrogen bond breaker, in an amount of at least 12 percent by weight, and a cationic polyquaternary resin or combinations thereof having a conductivity, when measured at 0.1 percent by weight concentration, from 225U mhos to 25u mhos in an amount of at least 0.10 percent by weight, said composition having a pH in the range of 5.5 to S.5. The compositions of this invention perform in an unexpected manner when applied to hair. More particularly, the sulfite and or bisulfite compositions of this invention containing urea and the cationic polyquaternaries together produce a level of curl tightness well above that possible with the urea or cationic polyquaternary by itself. In short, the combination of urea and polyquaternary effectuates an enhancement of curl tightness that is unexpected and well above what could reasonably be considered an additive result. The compositions of the invention may be used with or without the utilization of heat e.g., heat from a hair dryer . Further details of the components of the compositions of the invention are given below. 1. UREA COMPONENT In general, the urea is in an amount from about 10 percent to 20 by weight, preferably from 12 to 18 by weight. While amounts higher than 20 may be used no appreciable benefit appears to be obtained at such high amounts. When urea is in an amount somewhat higher than 18 such, for example, as 20 percent, there is no detrimental effect but there is also no gain in the amount of curl. In providing the urea component in addition to urea itself derivatives of urea may be used such as those disclosed in the following patents US A 3,847,165, which discloses urea, methyl urea, ethyl urea and mixtures thereof in a thiol waving system US A 3,399,682, which discloses urea and thio urea in thioglycolic acid system US A 2,717,228, which discloses urea and its alkyl derivatives in a thiol waving system US A 2,836,185, which discloses urea, urethane, formamide, and acetamide in a bisulfite waving system. In applying the composition of the invention, the high concentration of urea and the cat ionic polyquaternary of the low conductivity mentioned earlier in combination with the sulfite and or bisulfite, break the keratin bonds in such a manner that the composition gives excellent results as a hair waving and straightening composition. The urea component may be incorporated in the final composition just before use or added earlier if so desired. 2. CATIONIC POLYQUATERNARY As indicated earlier, the cationic polyquaternary has a conductivity, when measured at 0.1 , from 225U mhos to 25u mhos. The minimum concentration of cationic quaternary is about 0.07 percent by active weight basis and preferably at least 0.1 . Although the ease of hair combing increases as the cationic quaternary concentrate goes up e.g. 2.0 to 10 , the effect of the cationic quaternary concentration on curl tightness levels off at around 0.5 . A particularly preferred concentration is from 0.4 to 1.0 . Examples of suitable cationic polyquaternary are 1. Gafquat 755N quaternary copolymer of vinylpyrrolidonedimethylaminoethyl methacrylate 2. JR 125 Polymeric quaternary ammonium salt of hydroxyethyl cellulose trimethyl ammonium substituted epoxide 3. Celquat L 200 A Hydroxyethyl cellulose dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride graft copolymer 4. Celquat H 100 A Hydroxyethyl cellulose dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride graft copolymer 5. Binaguat P 100 Copolymer of acrylamide and methacryloyl oxyethylene trimethyl ammonium chloride. 6. PolyMAPTAC Polymethyl acrylamidopropyl trimethyl ammonium chloride. 3. WETTING AGENT Any of the following groups of surface active agents can be used in addition to the polyquaternaries in the formula cationic, non ionic, compatible anionic, and amphoteric surface active agents. In general, the wetting agent is used in amounts conventionally used in hair waving such, for example, as up to 50 by weight and preferably 0.1 to 10.0 percent by weight. 4. BUFFERING AGENT Any or a combination of alkali metals, ammonium or amine phosphate, acetate, lactate salts, etc., which can help maintain the pH of the product within the specified pll range can be used. A preferred pH is in the range of 6.5 to 7.5 though the range can be between pH 5.5 to 8.5.At pH below 5.5 there is significant bisulfite breakdown resulting in a SO2 odour generation. 5. SULFITE AND OR BISULFITE COMPONENTS The sulfite and or bisulfite component is in an amount conventionally used in hair waving and straightening compositions. In hair waving the broad range is 4 to 20 by weight and preferably 5 to 8 . For hair straightening the broad range is 4 to 20 by weight and preferably 8 to 12 by weight. 6. OTHER INGREDIENTS It is understood that fragrance compounds, coloring agents, thickening agents, opacifying agents, sequestrene agents, solubilizing agents, conditioning agents, etc. may be added to this invention in amounts conventionally used in hair waving and straightening compositions. As indicated earlier, conventional neutralizer compositions may be used with the hair waving and straightening compositions of this invention. The neutralizing chemicals used for our waving system are any of the oxidizing agents capable of restoring the disulfide linkages in the hair keratin during the resetting stage, such as aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide, alkali metal bromates, alkali metal perborates, urea hydrogen peroxide, etc. while sodium sesquicarbonate may be used instead of the oxidizing agents for the new hair waving straightening system. Rinsing alone with water may restore the broken linkages as well but it will be slower.

In the first group of formulations disclosed inTable I, a number of hair waving formulations ExamplesA Q were prepared which had the same chemical makeup as as the hair waving composition of Example 1 and Example 3 except that a different cationic material and or a different amount of cationic material was used from that employed in Examples 1 and 3 with the amount of water being varied from that used in Examples 1 and 3 to make up for the difference between the amount of cationic material used in the example.

In fact, the curl characteristics are similar to that obtained with typical thioglycolate system without the unpleasant odour. On the other hand, curl evaluations with formulations shown in Example H to Q indicates that the curl tightness is much poorer than the thioglycolate system and Example 1 through G formu ations. In the second group of formulations Examples R X shown in Table 2, the formilation of Example 3 was colllpared with the same base formula of Example 3 except urea is an amount of OSo, 5 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 18 and 20 instead of 16 along with an appropriate adjustment in the amount of water to make up the 100 by weight.

That compositions of the present invention are less of a risk than thioglycolates with respect to hair damage is shown by the now described experiments to determine the effects of multiple permings on the physical properties of hair, i.e. are the hair waving compositions evaluated drying and damaging to the hair and, if so, how much. The following systems were evaluated. SYSTEM A Bisulfite Sulfite Polyquaternary This system A uses a bisulfite sulfite polyquat hair waving formulation and a neutralizer which are of the following formulae System A Hair Waving Lotion Bisulfite Polyquat System by weightLaureth 23 1.00Sequestrene disodium EDTA 0.05Hydroxyethyl cellulosedimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride graft copolymer 0.75Ammonium Bisulfite 6.50Ammonium Sulfite 1.20Monoethanolamine to pH 7.0 1.90Water, Deionized q.s. to 100.00 System A NeutralizerHydrogen Peroxide 35 3.7142Phosphoric Acid 85 to pH 2.5 0.08Acetophenetidin 0.012Water, High Resistance to 100.00 SYSTEM B Urea Bisulfite Slfite Polyquaternary This system employs the hair waving composition ofExample 3 and the same neutralizer described above withSystem A.

The evaluation was done on virgin brown hair, using an exploratory sample size of ten fibers. Each perm was evaluated after one, two and three treatments.Method and ResultsMETHOD The Biophysical evaluation was done on virgin brown hair. The sample size was ten fibers test. Each perm was evaluated after one, two and three treatments.Individual fibers were cut in half to provide an untreated control half and a treated half, which was wound onto a 1 4 nylon permanent wave rod. The perm processing times were 60 minutes for the bisulfite sulfite polyquaternary, 45 minutes for the urea bisulfite sulfite polyquaternary, and 20 minutes for the alkaline thioglycolate system. Before treating, all fibers were equilibrated at least 24 hours at 21OC and 20 relative humidity. Between each perm the fibers were shampooed four times. The Instron tensile tester was used to produce stress strain curves on the fibers. RESULTS It was obvious that the perming systems are drying and damaging to the hair, especially after three perms.However, there are differences between them. The differences in each category are significant from perm to perm. That is, the alkaline thio system is significantly more drying and more damaging than the urea bisulfite sulfite polyquaternary perm whether after one, two, or three perms. Likewise, the urea bisulfite sulfite polyquaternary perm is more damaging than the bisulfite sulfite polyquaternary perm.
