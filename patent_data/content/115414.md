# Treatment of resin based printing plates.

## Abstract
Smudging and or linting of resin printing plates is prevented or reduced by treating the plates with a flurocarbon surface active agent having a perfluoroalkyl group with 4 to 14 carbon atoms. The surface active agent may be anionic, cationic or ampholytic and may be used in an aqueous, alcohol or aqueous alcohol solution.
