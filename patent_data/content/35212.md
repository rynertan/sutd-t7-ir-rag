# Printing position adjusting mechanism for printers.

## Abstract
Herein disclosed is a printing position adjusting me chanism for use in a printer of the type in which a printing head I is carried on the leading end portion of a yoke 21 and has its type row arranged in the longitudinal direction of the yoke. The printing position adjusting mechanism includes an externally threaded adjusting ring 10 , which is adapted, when screwed into the internally threaded hole 9 formed in the front frame plate 5b of the yoke, to bring its leading end face into abutment engage ment with the leading end face 23 of the yoke so that the printing head may be moved longitudinally of the yoke, thereby adjusting the printing position thereof relative to the yoke. Further included is means for fixing the printing head at a desired printing position to the yoke. The means includes an internally threaded hole 22 , which is formed in the leading end face of the yoke, and a fixing screw 12 of a size to be screwed in the threaded hole. This fixing screw is inserted into the center hole 11 of the adjusting ring. Thus, the printing position can be adjusted reliably with ease merely by screwing the adjusting ring in the threaded hole in the printing head.
