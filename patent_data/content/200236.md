## Description
The invention relates to a machine and a method for forming windings on electric motor stators. Machines for forming stator windings are known in which a needle, driven with rectilinear reciprocating motion combined with reciprocating rotary motion about its axis, carries at least one copper wire unwinding from a reel in order to deposit it in the stator armature slot. The needle comprises one point if a single winding is to be made, or comprises two opposing points if both windings are to be made simultaneously, as shown in document FR A 2514211. In all cases, the needle always has its axis of advancement and rotation coinciding with the stator axis in order to enable it to slide in the open spaces between the slots within the stator during its to and fro movement and to lie equidistant from all the armature slots on which its points are to wind the copper wire. Moreover, in the case of a stator with two opposing windings, winding forms, also known as shoes, are applied to the ends of the respective slots, and are shaped in such a manner as to accompany the copper wire of the needle into the slot, when the needle rotates external to the stator. These shoes have a basic and specific purpose in that, as stated, the needle is coaxial to the stator axis and thus its point cannot pass beyond the winding retention tooth during its rotation which takes place beyond the inner diameter of the stator, so that, if the shoe is not used, the copper wire is unable to wind on to the slot beyond the retiontion tooth. If the retention tooth does not exist, only a few turns could be deposited, and these would represent only a small percentage of those required. In addition to the need to construct these shoes accurately, they must also be properly sized for each stator to be constructed, even though they represent an element which forms no part of the final product. In this respect, the shoes are removed by two devices when the winding has been formed. In addition, four tensioning devices have to be set up to hold the shoes rigidly against the stator during the forming stage, and to enable them to be rapidly released from it when the forming is complete. The main object of the invention is to provide a machine for forming a stator winding which enables the use of winding forms or shoes to be dispensed with, together with their tensioning devices and the devices which release them from the stator. A further object of the invention is to improve the winding which is formed about each slot by reducing the needle stroke and the loop which the wire makes external to the stator, by virtue of the elimination of the shoes, as determined by the main object of the invention. These and further objects which will be more apparent hereinafter are attained according to the invention by a stator winding machine as claimed in claim 1 and by a method for forming a winding in electric motor stators as claimed in claim 7. The subject of the invention is described hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings in which The drawings illustrate a two winding stator of traditional type, comprising the hollow cylinder 10 constituted by high magnetic permeability laminations which, on the inside of the structure, assume two opposing dovetail configurations 11 which define the slots 12 in which the windings 13 are disposed. On the front and rear face of the stator there are applied plastics sections 14 which reproduce its surface, to project at 15 from the dovetails 11 where they comprises a tooth 16 intended to form a frontal retainer for the winding 13 non always essential . The needle 17 is of the single point type 18 and, according to the invention, has its translation and rotation axis x eccentric to the stator centre y. Again according to the invention, the axis x is at a distance a from the centre y, along the fictitious straight line z passing through the middle of the two opposing dovetails 11, such that the distance b between the axis x and the end 19 of the point 18 is greater than the distance c between the axis x and the end of that tooth 16 which is closest to said axis x. To obtain this it is necessary only to move the stator 10 out of alignment with the needle 17, thus keeping the entire apparatus which determines the to and fro movement and rotary movement of the needle unchanged, and simply modifying the support for the stator so that this latter is no longer coaxial to the needle but is eccentric by the aforesaid distances, as shown on the drawings. By this means, the needle 17 makes the winding 13 without requiring the aid of the currently necessary shoes. This is because when the needle is external to the stator and has to make the wire undergo the loop about the supports 13, the point 18 is in a position almost in contact with the tooth 16 Figure 3 , and its end 19 is advantageously beyond the upper end of said tooth so that the wire which projects from the point 18 does not require any accompaniment in order to become lodged in the recess formed between the walls of the section 14 and the tooth 16. This advantage can only be obtained by providing the eccentricity a between the needle axis x and the stator centre y, because if the axes x and y coincided, the point 18 would not be able to project beyond the tooth 16 as it would be larger than the inner diameter of the stator, and this is the reason why shoes are currently used for accompanying the wire delivered by the point 18 beyond the tooth 16 into the inner slot. Dispensing with the use of the shoes gives an obvious advantage to the constructor, who is thus able to eliminate one component of complicated construction, and of which the purpose is limited to the winding formation stage. It also enables the tensioning devices and the tensioning device passage slots provided between the insulating support 14 and the structure 10 to be also eliminated, thus also reducing the overall length of the stator. This also enables a shorter needle stroke to be determined, with consequent higher speed of formation of the winding. Again, by eliminating the shoes, the wire delivered by the needle makes a smaller loop as it is practically in contact with the support 15 during the rotation of the point 18, and thus the winding is certainly improved in terms of its compactness. When the winding 13 has been terminated, the second winding on the opposite slot can be formed by various methods. A first method can consist of providing a second working station downstream of the first, in which a second needle is mounted eccentric to the stator as in the first station, but with respect to the other slot on which the new winding 13 is to be formed. Figure 4 diagrammatically illustrates how this first method can be attained, the stator 10 being retained in position by jaws 21 of a frame 22 in the station A in which a needle 17 is eccentric to the upper slot 12 . When the winding 13 has been formed on it, the frame 22 is moved into the station B in which the needle 17 is eccentric to the lower slot 12 , on which the second winding can be formed. Another method can consist of providing a device which causes the stator to rotate through 180 about its centre y so that, while keeping the position of the needle 17 unchanged, the second slot now becomes located in the position previously occupied by the first with respect to the needle. Figure 5 diagrammatically illustrates a possible embodiment of this second method in which the support frame for the stator 10 is in the form of a ring gear 23 which engages with a gear wheel 24 rotated by a motor 25 so as to cause the stator to rotate through 180 after the formation of the winding on the slot 12 and position the slot 12 to correspond with said needle 17 for the subsequent formation. A third method is to provide two side by side stations operating on two stators, these latter being interconnected by a device which causes them to rotate simultaneously through 180 , so that they each become rotated through 180 about their own needle to enable the winding to now be made on the empty slots. This third method would mean that there would be no change in the present operating times of machines comprising needles with two opposing points for forming windings simultaneously on both the slots, in that the complete formation takes place on two stators simultaneously. This third method is diagrammatically illustrated in Figure 6 in which it can be seen that the supports 23 for the two side by side stators 10 are toothed as in the method of Figure 5, and engage with a gear wheel 24 of the type shown in Figure 5 but interposed between the two supports 23. The aforesaid represent only three of the possible methods for forming the windings, these being given by way of example only, as are the practical embodiments shown diagrammatically, but these are not limitative of the possible methods or of the possible embodiments of the winding formation machine according to the claims of invention.
