# Apparatus for providing a rim on the tips of ballpoint pens.

## Abstract
The apparatus allows providing a rim on the tips for ballpoint pens even if made of a very hard material, such as stainless steel, as it can withstand very great pressure. It comprises a first body 1 rotating about an axis 8 which coincides with the axis of the tip 10 to be provided with a rim. The body 1 is provided with an eccentric hole 11 on whose axis 9 a second body 3 rotates on first rolling means, in which second body 3 a pivot 5 rotates coaxially by means of second relling means. The pivot 5 has on its inner end 5 pushing means 12 and on its external end a first convergent conical sur face 5 which presses directly on the edge 6 of the tip to be provided with a rim with the aid of a second divergent conical surface 3 joined to said second body 3 . The two surfaces 3 and 5 are such as to constitute the angle Î± which is most suitable for providing a rim on the edge 6 of the tip 10 by retaining the ball with the desired clearance.
