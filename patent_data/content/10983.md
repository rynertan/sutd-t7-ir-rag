# Positioning apparatus.

## Abstract
Positioning apparatus enabling an article such as, for example, a wafer 15 to be subjected to a photo lithographic exposure, to be positioned accurately, for example in relation to an exposure mask 12 . The article rests in frictional engagement on a support 22 coupled to piezoelectric transducers 17 . The article may be moved through very small distances by applying suitable DC voltages to the pie zoelectric transducers. For greater movements an asymme tric waveform may be applied to the transducers, causing the article to move with a jogging motion through much greater distances. The asymmetric waveform may be ob tained, for example, by charging and discharging the capa city of the transducers through resistors of suitable value, or by applying a full wave rectified AC voltage to them. Four transducers may be used to enable the article to be moved in either of two mutually perpendicular directions or rotated about an axis. The supports 22 may be tubular and means 26, 27 may be provided for applying vacuum through them to increase the pressure of frictional engage ment.
