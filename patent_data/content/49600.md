# Electrolytic refining of molten metal.

## Abstract
In a process for refining Al or Mg a stream of relatively impure molten metal is passed along one face of a grille separator 63 having interstices of the order of 0.1 1 cm in width. The interstices are filled with a molten salt electrolyte adapted to transport ions of the selected metal Al or Mg to a body of refined metal on the opposite side of the separator. The relatively impure metal is made the anode and the refined metal is the cathode. Refined metal is progressively withdrawn from the cathode. The grille separator may be arranged substantially vertical or substantially horizontal, usually with slight inclination. Passages are preferably provided in the separator to allow escape of gas generated at a metal electrolyte interface.
