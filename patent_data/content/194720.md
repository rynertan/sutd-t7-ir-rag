# HANDLING DATA PACKETS

## Abstract
In an arrangement for handling packets of data, data is serially applied to a data formatting device 2 and stored in a RAM 3 from where it is applied on A and B data lines 4, 5 as simultaneous packets with an interval of a duration at least as long as a packet between adjacent packets. The A and B data lines 4, 5 respectively carry packets from respective A and B sub multiplexes or subframes. A number of service recovery devices 6, 7, 8 are coupled to both the data lines 4, 5 for recovering service information from appropriately addressed BC packets containing ser vice information When a BI packet containing service interpretation appears on a data line the service recovery device with the corresponding address produces an output BID which causes the BI packet which is still in the RAM 3 to load the BI packet into a processor memory 14 during the interval following its appearance. A microcompu ter 9 uses this stored information to control the service recovery devices.
