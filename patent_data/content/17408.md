# Apparatus for mixing fluids comprising fluid flow restricting device.

## Abstract
A fluid flow restricting apparatus for use in a fluid mixer comprises a body 200 of solid material housing capillary tubes 226 in passages 206 to 224 . Nuts 240 compress elastomeric O ring sealing members 242 such that they make fluid tight seals between the capillary tubes and their respective passages. An inlet header 202 is demountably attached to the body 200 and has inlets 246, 248, 250 and 252 communicating with chambers 254, 256, 258 and 260 respectively. By means of the chambers, the inlet 246 is placed in communication with the capillary tubes in pas sages 206, 208, 210 and 212 the inlet 248 with the tubes in passages 214, 216 and 218 the inlet 250 with the tubes in passages 220 and 222 and the inlet 252 with the tube in the passage 224 . The outlets of the capillary tubes com municate with a common outlet passage 236 . The appar atus may be readily dismantled and reassembled to allow the capillary tubes to be changes.
