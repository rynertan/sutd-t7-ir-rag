## Description
DESCRIPTION AXIAL FORCE OPERATED BALL VALVE Fluid couplings and fittings are widely employed to interconnect components of conduit systems. For instance, self sealing valved couplings are often utilized at the ends of hose lines wherein uncoupling of the mating parts automatically causes valve components within the parts to close to prevent fluid leakage. Assembly of the coupling parts automatically opens the valves to reestablish fluid flow between the coupling parts. Self sealing couplings and fittings commonly employ axially movable valves of the sliding sleeve or poppet type which utilize the relative axial movement of the coupling parts during assembly or disassembly to open or close the valves, respectively. Poppet and sleeve type valves usually include ports and flow paths having an axis which is perpendicularly or transversely disposed to the axis of the associated fitting passage, and due to the torturous flow path through or around the valve considerable resistance to fluid flow is produced. Further, high turbulence is created due to the fluid rapidly changing direction during flow through the fitting, and pressure losses may be significant.Sleeve and moppet valves often utilize springs to bias the valves toward the closed condition,.and while valves of this type are capable of automatic operation controlled by the assembly capable of automatic operation controlled by the assembly and disassembly of the coupling parts the adverse fluid flow characteristics have been tolerated as alternate constructions were not available which were practical and dependable in operation, particularly with respect to the automatic self sealing feature. Ball valves employing a spherical ball element having a large diametrical flow passage bore are used in conduit systems whereiD high capacity, low flow resistance characteristics are required. As the bore within a ball valve is often of a diameter equal to the passage within the associated fitting, the valve, itself, offers little restriction to fluid flow, and as only a 900 rotation of the ball valve is required between full open and closed positions such valves are quick acting. However, ball valves usually require an external operator, such as a lever or handle, for rotating the ball valve between open and closed positions, and ball valves have not been readily adapted to self sealing coupling use wherein the ball valve element must pivot between open and closed conditions depending on whether the coupling parts are connected or disconnected.Preferably, selfsealing valved fittings are fully automatic wherein the valve operation is solely determined by the coupling and uncoupling action of the parts, and no manual valve operation is necessary. It is an object of the invention to provide a self sealing fitting utilizing a ball valve which is automatically displaced between open and closed conditions solely by the act of coupling and uncoupling the fitting to other parts of the flow system. Another object of the invention is to provide a self sealing fitting for controlling fluid flow utilizing an automatically operated ball valve wherein the ball valve is operated between open and closed conditions solely by axial forces imposed thereon during coupling and uncoupling of the fitting. A further object of the invention is to provide a self sealing fitting utilizing a ball valve which produces little restriction to fluid flow through the valve, and wherein the ball valve is rotated between open and closed conditions by th act of coupling the fitting to another fitting, or the uncoupling thereof, respectively, axial forces imposed upon the ball valve determining the rotation of the valve between its open and closed conditions. Yet another object of the invention is to provide a self sealing fitting utilizing a ball valve having a pivot offset with respect to the ball center and bore, such that axial displacement of the ball valve within the fitting passage while axially restraining the pivot causes the ball valve to rotate between open and closed conditions solely due to its axial displacement. In the practice of the invention the fitting body includes a passage through which fluid flow occurs. A ball valve is located within the passage having an exterior spherical surface and a diametrical bore of a diameter substantially equal to the fitting passage.The ball valve includes pivot pins extending from the spherical surface defining an operating pivot axis which is offset relative to the center of the ball valve and relative to the valve bore. An annular groove defined within the passage receives the pivot pins restraining the same against passage axial displacement, but permitting rotation and radial displacement of the pivot. An annular valve seat is slidably displaceable within the fitting passage and is sealed with respect to the passage by a seal ring engaging a cyWindrical surface. The valve seat also includes an annular seal sealingly engaging the spherical exterior surface of the ball valve, and the valve seat bore is of a diameter substantially equal to the ball valve bore. An annular collar is located in the fitting passage upon the opposite side of the ball aive with respect to the varve seat and is also axially displaceable, and a compression spring biases the collar into engagement with the ball valve and biases the ball valve into engagement with the valve seat. Axial displacement of the collar, ball valve and valve seat is limited by a stop defined within the fitting passage.An internal thread is concentrically formed within the passage adjacent the valve seat stop for receiving a conduit adapter which couples with the fitting. The support of the ball valve by the valve seat and collar permits the ball valve to rotate within the fitting passage solely by axial forces being imposed upon the ball valve through is associated valve seat or collar. Such axial forces rotate the ball valve due to the offset position of the valve pivot wherein a torque is imposed upon the ball valve during axial displacement thereof and the valve will rotate while its center remains coincident with the fitting passage axis. The biasing force imposed upon the ball valve by the spring biases the ball valve toward the fitting open end until the valve seat engages its stop. Under this condition the valve bore will be perpendicularly disposed to the axis of the fitting passage, and in this condition the valve seat will not communicate with the valve bore and the fitting passage is closed with respect to fluid flow therethrough. This is the normal uncoupled condition of the fitting. Upon the coupling of another fitting, adapter or other coupling half to the fitting by means of an annular stem engaging the passage threads the valve seat is engaged and axially displaced away from its stop compressing the collar spring. This axial movement of the valve seat, ball valve and collar causes the ball valve to rotate due to the rotational force imposed on the ball valve by the pivot, and upon full connection of the fitting with its associated coupling part the ball valve will have rotated 900 to align the valve bore with the fitting passage to open the passage to full unrestricted flow.Removal of the associated fitting by unthreading the stem permits the spring to move the collar, ball valve and valve seat toward the stop pivoting the ball valve toward its closed condition such that complete uncoupling results in the ball valve being fully closed and the fitting is nself sealed . From the above description, it will be appreciated that rotation of the ball valve between open and closed conditions is solely produced by axial forces imposed upon the ball valve by its valve seat or biasing collar. The aforementioned objects and advantages of the invention will be appreciated from the following description and accompanying drawings wherein Fig. 1 is an elevational view, partially sectioned, illustrating a fitting in accord with the invention, the ball valve being illustrated in the closed condition, Fig. 2 is an elevational view of a fitting in ac cord with the invention, partially sectioned, illustrating a conduit adapter associated with the fitting in a fully coupled rela tionship and wherein the ball valve is in the full open condition, Fig. 3 is an elevational, sectional view illus trating the ball valve as taken along Section Ill Ill of Fig. 2, Fig. 4 is an elevational, sectional view along Section IV IV of Fig. 2 but illustrating the ball valve in elevation and partially opened, and omitting the valve seat for purpose of illustration, Fig. 5 is a top plan, schematic view of the ball valve and its pivot showing the valve in the closed condition, and Fig. 6 is a top plan schematic view similar to Fig. 5, and in alignment therewith, illus trating the ball valve and its pivot when in the open condition. In the drawings a single self sealing fitting 10 is illustrated, and this fitting may be connected to the end of a flexible hose or a stationary component of a conduit system, it being understood that the fitting 10 can be utilized in the known manner of any self sealing fitting or coupling. The fitting including an open end 12 to which other components of the conduit system may be attached, and the end 14 uonstitutes the closed end of the fitting associated with a hose, elbow, pipe, or other conduit system component which is pressurized or in communication with the medium to be controlled. The fitting body is defined by an outer annular por tion 16 and inner annular portion 18 interconnected by a drive wire 20 inserted within annular aligned grooves within the portions 16 and 18 in the known manner. The portion 18 is provided with exterior threads 22 for connection to the associated hose or conduit component and the portion 16 is formed with wrench flats 24 for receiving a wrench. The body portion 16 includes a concentric passage and the passage is internally threaded at 26. A cylindrical surface 28 is formed within the passage adjacent the threads 26, and a stop smoulder 30 is radially defined at the transition betweea the threads and surface 28. An annular groove 32 is formed within the portion 16 and is partially defined by a radial surface 34 lying within a plane perpendicular to the axis of the portion 16. The body portion 18 includes sealing means 36 interposed between the portions 16 and 18 to establish a fluid seal therebetween, and internally, the portion 18 defines passage 38. A shoulder surface 40 constitutes an anchor for the compression spring 42, as later described, and the inner end surface 44 of the portion 18 lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis of the fitting and is in spaced parallel relationship to the surface 34 of the portion 16 and forms a portion of the groove 32. The valving element comprises a ball valve 46 located within the fitting passage rotatable through 900 between open and closed positions. The ball valve 46 in cludes a spherical outer surface 48, and is provided with an internal diametrically related cylindrical bore 50 which is concentric with the center of the ball valve. The diameter of the bore 50 is substantially equal to the effective fluid flow diameter through the fitting so that the ball valve does not create a restriction to fluid flow. The ball valve 46 is provided with a pivot 52 which is defined by a pair of coaxial pivot pins 54 received within blind holes drilled in the ball valve intersecting the exterior surface 48. The pins 54 project from the ball surface a sufficient distance to permit their outer ends to be received between the surfaces 34 and 44 defining the groove 32, as will be apparent fromFigs. 1 4. The location of the axis of the pivot 52 defined by pins 54 is of significance in producing the desired control of the ball valve. As best appreciated from Figs.5 and 6, the pivot pins 52 are located such that the pivot axis is offset with respect to the center 56 of the ball valve, and is also offset with respect to the axis 58 of the valve bore 50. The pivot axis is preferably perpendicular to the axis of the bore 50, and lies within a plane obliquely intersecting the valve bore axis 58 at a 450 included angle. The radial distance of the pivot axis from the ball center is such to provide a sufficient torque arm to permit the ball valve to rotate under rela tively small axial forces imposed upon the valve, but this distance is not so great as to require excessive axial displacement of the ball valve to cause pivoting between its open and closed conditions. It is to be understood that the pivot 52 functions as a crank or lever arm to rotate the ball valve, and that the ball valve 46 does not rotate relative to the pivot 52. An annular valve seat 60 is received within the passage of portion 16 in alignment with the cylindrical surface 28, and the valve seat is axially displaceable within the surface 28 and sealed thereto by O ring seal assembly 62 which engages surface 28. The valve seat includes an internal passage bore 64, and is provided with a spherical segment surface 66 which engages the valve surface 48, and includes an annular groove for receiving O ring 68. Adjacent its outer end the valve seat 60 includes a tapered surface 70 adjacent the seal ring 72 for engagement by the valve actuating element, as later described. Also, a radial stop shoulder 74 is formed on the valve seat facing shoulder 30. An annular collar 76 engages the ball valve 46 on the opposite side of the valve with respect to the valve seat 60. The collar includes a bore passage 78, and spherical segment surface 80 engages the valve surface 48. The collar 76 is externally recessed to provide clearance for receiving the compression spring 42, and one end of the compression spring engages the collar radial shoulder 82, while the other spring end engages the body portion surface 40. Accordingly, it will be appreciated that the spring 42 exerts a continuous axial biasing force on the collar 76, ball valve 46, and valve seat 60 toward the right, Fig. 1 and 2. Movement of the valve seat 60 to the right is limited by engagement of the valve seat stop shoulder 74 with the stop shoulder as apparent in Fig. 1. The axial dimension of the groove 32 as defined by surfaces 34 and 44 is slightly greater than the diameter of the pivot pins 54 wherein the pivot pins are capable of rotation within the groove 32, and may also be laterally radially displaced therein during ball valve rotation. The groove 32 will maintain the pivot 52 perpendicular to the axis of the fitting at all times, and rotational displacement of the pivot about the fitting axis does not affect the operation of the ball valve. From the aforedescribed structural relationships it will be appreciated that the biasing force imposed upon the ball valve in the axial direction of the fitting passage by the collar 76 and spring 42 will cause a rotation of the ball valve about its center 56 and relative to the fitting axis. As both the collar and valve seat are capable of axial displacement within the fitting, and as the ball valve is capable of rotating relative to the collar and valve seat, axial displacement of the ball valve causes the torque to be imposed upon the ball valve due to the fact t.at the pivot pins 54 are restrained against axial movement within the groove 32.The pivot 52 is so located upon the ball valve 46, and the stop shoulders 30 and 74 are so related to the significant dimensions of the ball valve and pivot that, in the normally closed position shown in Fig. 1, the ball valve 46 will have rotated such that the axis of the bore 50 is disposed at 900 to the axis of the fitting, as shown in Fig. 1, and represented in Fig. 5.In this closed position the bore 50 will not communicate with the valve seat bore 64 and flow through the fitting is prevented. Opening of the fitting is automatically achieved by connecting the fitting to another component of the conduit system capable of exerting an axial force upon the valve seat and ball valve. In the preferred embodiment this axial force is produced by a conduit member threaded onto threads 26 A typical conduit connection is shown in Fig. 2 wherein an adapter 84 has been threaded onto threads 26. The adapter 84 may constitute a portion of a hose fitting, or a stationary component of the conduit system wherein, by threads 86, it is attached to a hose nipple or other conventional conduit system component. The adapter includes wrench flats 88, is internally provided with a passage 90, and includes an externally threaded neck or stem 92 for mating with the threads 26. The nose of the neck 92 is formed with an oblique surface which engages the valve seat surface 70, and cylindrical surface 94 is engaged by seal 72. Upon threading the adapter neck 92 onto threads 26 the engagement of the adapter and valve seat surface 70 will displace the valve seat 60 toward the left, Fig. 2, as the adapter 84 is threaded into, the fitting 10. This axial displacement of the valve seat to the left, also displaces ball valve 46 and, collar 76 compressing spring 42.As the surface 44 of groove 32 prevents the pivot pins 54 from axial displacement within the fitting a torque is applied to the ball valve 46 as it moves to the left causing relative rotation with respect to the valve seat 46 and collar 76. The length of the. adapter neck 92 is such that sufficient rotation of the ball valve occurs to rotate the valve from the closed position of Fig. 1 to the fully open position shown in Figs. 2 and 6 wherein the bore 50 is in axial alignment with the axis of the fitting.As the diameter of the valve bore 50 substantially corresponds to the diameters of the valve seat bore 64 and collar bore 78 flow through the fitting 10 is essentially unrestricted when the ball valve is in the fully open position, and the pivoting of the ball valve from the closed to the open position is automatically achieved merely by the connection of the fitting 10 to the adapter 84 and the utilization of the relative axial displacement of these components during coupling. When the fitting 10 and adapter 84 are uncoupled the spring 42 will force the collar 76, valve 46 and valve seat 60 to the right as the adapter neck is retracted from the fitting, and such movement will pivot the ball valve 46 toward the closed condition shown inFig. 1 upon the adapter 84 being completely uncoupled from the fitting 10. The biasing force produced by the spring 42 assures that a sealed connection between the ball valve and valve seat 60 occurs at all times regardless of whether the system is under pressure when the valve is closed. Further, the positive engagement between the valve seat and ball valve exterior surface, and the sealing between the valve seat and the body portion 16, assures a leak proof fitting capable of withstanding high internal pressures. It is to be appreciated that during rotation of the ball valve between its opened and closed positions that the center of the ball valve remains coaxial with the fitting axis. This relationship is maintained by the engagement of the valve seat and collar spherical surfaces 66 and 80, respectively, with the exterior of the ball valve, and yet no binding occurs in that the pivot pins 54 are capable of lateral radial displacement within the groove 32 as is necessary to accommodate the pivot pin movement during ball valve rotation. Thus, during ball valve operation the pivot pin will both rotate and be slightly laterally radially displaced within the groove. It will be appreciated that the aforedescribed structure provides a self sealing fitting utilizing a ball valve wherein movement of the ball valve between open and closed conditions is solely determined by axial forces and displacements occurring within the fitting and no external valve operator is required.Modifications to the inventive concepts may be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
