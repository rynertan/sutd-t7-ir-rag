# CURVED SURFACE FORMING METHOD.

## Abstract
Sectional data given by a design drawing, sectional curve data and the like are input to a memory 302 , and a cylindrical intermediate section production unit 303 produces an intermediate section by a cylindrical inter mediate section production method selectively instructed from the respective data and a plurality of methods. A cylin drical intermediate sectional curve production unit 304 produces an intermediate sectional curve by a cylindrical intermediate sectional curve production method selectively instructed from the respective data and a plurality of meth ods. A tape production control unit 305 converts the data relative to the intermediate section and the sectional curve production into an NC tape format for a machine tool and produces the NC tape format.
