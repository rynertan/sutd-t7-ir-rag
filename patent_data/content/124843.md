# Process and composition for the production of polyurethane elastomer moldings.

## Abstract
The present invention is directed to a process for the production of polyurethane elastomer moldings by reacting a reaction mixture in a closed mold, wherein said reaction mix ture comprises a an organic polyisocyanate b an organic active hydrogen group containing com pound having a molecular weight of from 1800 to 12,000 and containing at least two active hydrogen groups c 1,3,5 triethyl 2, 6 diamino benzene and, optionally d a catalyst for the reaction between hydroxyl groups and isocyanate groups, wherein component c is present in an amount of from 25 to 35 percent by weight based on the combined weight of com ponents b and c , wherein the amounts of components a , b and c are such that the isocyanate index of the reaction mixture is from about 90 to 110, and wherein all of said components are processed via a one shot process whereby a is mixed simultaneously either with b , c and d or with a non reacted premixture of some or all of b , c and d .
