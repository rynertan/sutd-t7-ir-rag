## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF SYNTHESIS GAS The invention relates to a process for the production of synthesis gas with an increased H2 CO ratio from normally gaseous hydrocarbons comprising the following steps a at least one normally gaseous hydrocarbon is converted into a synthesis gas comprising H2 and CO by partial oxidation with an oyygencontaining gas b at least one normally gaseous hydrocarbon is converted with steam into a gaseous mixture comprising H2 and CO c the gaseous mixture comprising H2 and CO, formed in step b is separated into a CO cantaining stream and a H2 stream d the H2 CO ratio of the synthesis gas produced in step a is increased by adding at least part of the H2 stream obtained in step c thereto. An object of the invention is to increase the H2 CO ratio of a synthesis gas resulting from the conversion of normally gaseous hydrocarbons thereby enabling the reaction of the carbon compuonds with an optimal or near optimal consumption of energy and materials in the manufacture of synthesis gas from gaseous fuels. By products and waste products from Jie mical synthesis and natural gas can be employed as the gaseous fuels. In the autothermic partial oxidation of hydrocarbons the necessary thermal energy is supplied by the process itself via partial combustion of the feedstock. This technique is also technically involved as well as requiring an oxygen containing gas. The oxygen containing gas may be pure oxygen, air or mixtures of pure oxygen and air. In view of the depletion of oil reserves, the partial oxidation of gaseous fuels to synthesis gas, which is a feedstock for many chemicals, is a subject of growing interest. The partial oxidation of gaseous feedstocks can take place according to various established processes. These processes include the Shell Gasification Process. A catprhhensive survey of this process can be found in the Oil and Gas Journal, September 6, 1971, pp 85 90. The partial oxidation of gaseous fuels is usually carried out at temperatures around 900 to roughly 1600 OC, preferably 1100 to 1500 C and pressures up to 100 bar, preferably 5 to 100 bar. As a consequence of the high partial oxidation temperature and the use of gaseous fuels as feedstocks, the resulting synthesis gas contains no ash, slag, soot or tar, thereby elimi nating the necessity of using expensive purification steps. Raised pressure, high temperature and a gaseous feed lead to a high degree of conversion and relative to the volume of the gasification chamber, they effect a high specific througput. In the majority of plants in which synthesis gas converted into products such as ammcnia, Oxo carpaunds, methanol or produbts from the Fiseher Trcpsch synthesis and which operate under pressure, a considerable part of the investment required for the compression can be saved on partial oxidizing gaseous fuels under pressure. Carpared to the established gasification processes in which ash containing fuel is employed or which operate under normal pressure, the pressure partial oxidation of gaseous fuel permits a considerable saving in the manufacturing costs of synthesis gas. The endothermic conversion of gaseous hydrocarbons with steam is described in Encyclopedia of chemical technology by Kirk Othmer 3rd edition, 1980 Volume 21, page 543. Endotbermic thermal or catalytic reaction of gaseous hydrocarbons, in the presence of steam to produce carbon monoxide and hydrogen is an established reaction which is operated industrially using various processes. Such a process can be carried out in a tubular reactor, the necessary heat of reaction being supplied via heat transport through the walls of the tubes or in a medium of externally heated solid heat exchanger material e.g. fine grained solid which is used in a fluidized bed. The known processes necessitate involved technology and exhibit law thermal efficiency. As mentioned hereinbefore the gaseous mixture comprising H2 and CO formed in the conversion of normally gaseous hydrocarbon s with steam step b is separated into a CO containing stream and an H2 stream. This separation step c can be carried out in every possible way e.g. cryogenicly, by means of membranes, absorption and or adsorption. It is preferably carried out by means of a pressure swing adsorption process. Such a process is described in US patent specification No. 3,699,218. The e CO containing stream resulting from separation step c mainly consists of CO, CO2 and CH4.At least part of it is preferably used for burning and at least part of the heat generated in this way is used for the conversion of the normally gaseous hydrocarbons in step b . At least part of the substantially pure hydrogen stream separated in step c is mixed with the synthesis gas produced in step a . In this manner the H2 CO ratio of this gas is preferably increased to a value in the range fran 1.8 t 2.5.Such as gas is very suitable for the synthesis of hydrocarbons according to the Fischer Ttopsch process, which process is described in the book The Fischer Tropsch and Related Syntheses by H.H. Storch, N. Goltittic and R.B. Anderson 1951 . Therefore the gas obtained in step d is at least in part catalytically converted in to a product comprising a hydrocarbon mixture.The invention also relates to a process for the production of a hydrocarbon mixture by the catalytic conversion of the synthesis gas produced in step d of the present synthesis gas generating process. This catalytic conversion is preferably carried out as described in one or more of the following patent documents UK patent specifications Nos. 1,548,468 and 2,077,289 UK patent applications Nos. 8,320,715 8,330,993 8,330,994 and 8,413,595 and Netherlands patent application No. 8,303,909. The product comprising a doocarbon mixture is preferably separated into a gaseous stream comprising noncamrerted CO and H2 and lcwwboiling hydrocarbons, and at least one stream coMprising normally liquid hydrocarbons. This separation can be carried out in any possible manner. Advantageously fractional distillation is used for this purpose. The low boiling hydrccartoos present in the gaseous stream also comprising CO and H2, suitably consist of C1 C4hydrocarbons, but higher boiling hydrocarbons may be present in this stream too. At least part of the gaseous stream comprising CO and H2 and lcw boiling hydrocarbons is preferably burned, suitably in a furnace, and at least part the heat generated by this burning is used for the endothermic conversion of at least part of the normally gaseous hydrocarbons with steam in step b of the present synthesis gas generating process. According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention at least part of the gaseous stream comprising CO and H2 and lcw boiling hydrocarbons is used as at least a part of the feed to step b in order to be converted with steam into the gaseous mixture comprising H2 and CO. According to still another embodiment of the invention at least part of the gaseous stream comprising CO and H2 and low boiling hydrocarbons is recycled to step a to be partially oxidized to synthesis gas. As mentioned hereinbefore at least one stream comprising normally liquid hydrocarbons is preferably separated from the product comprising a hydrocarbon mixture. Preferably at least part of this these normally liquid hydrocarbons containing stream s is are catalytically hydrocracked, advantageously using at least part of the H2 stream separated in step c of the present process. This hydrocracking step can be carried out in any possible way knawn in the art. Preference is given to a hydrocracking process using a supported noble metal catalyst as described inEuropean patent application No. 84,201,256.9. The product of the hydrocracking step is preferably subjected to a fractional distillation, at least one normally gaseous fraction comprising non converted hydrogen and low boiling hydrocarbons, at least one naphtha fraction, at least one kerosene fraction and at least one gas oil fraction being separated from the hydrocracking product. The e naphtha, kerosene and gasoil fractions are withdrawn from the present process as final products. The normally gaseous fraction s comprising non converted hydrogen and low boiling hydrocarbons suitably C1 C4 is are preferably recycled as a feed to step a and or step b of the present process and or is are advantageously burned for generating heat which is at least in part used in step b of the present synthesis gas production process. The synthesis gas with increased H2 CO ratio which is produced in step d of the present synthesis gas production process can not only be used for the production of hydrocarbons but also as a feedstock for methanol production. Therefore at least part of the gas obtained in step d is advantageously converted into a product comprising methanol. Suitably a gaseous stream comprising non converted CO andH2 is separated from this product and at least part thereof is burned for generating heat which is at least in part used for the conversion of at least part of the gaseous hydrocarbons with steam in step b of the present synthesis gas production process. Substantially pure methanol is separated fran the product of the methanol synthesis step and withdrawn as the final product of this step, while heavier products than methanol being obtained in this separation step are advantageously recycled to steps a or b of the present process to be used as feedstock for these steps and or as a means for generating heat for step b . The present process will now be further elucidated by means of Figure 1 of the drawling, which represents a simplified flow scheme of this process, to which flaw scheme the invention is by no means restricted. Natural gas is introduced via a line 1 into a desulphurization unit 2 where sulphur compounds H2S are removed therefrom. The desulphurized natural gas stream is passed via a line 3 into a gasification unit 4 where it is converted by partial oxidation into synthesis gas, mainly consisting of CO and H2. To this end air is introduced via a line 5 into an air separation unit 6 where it is separated into a N2 containing stream, withdrawn via a line 7 and a substantially pure oxygen stream passed via a line 8 to a line 9 where it is mixed with steam introduced into the system via a line 10. The oxygen steam mixture is passed via the line 9 into the gasification unit 4 where it is reacted with the desulphurized natural gas. The resulting synthesis gas having anH2 CO ratio below 1.7 is withdrawn fran the gasifier 4 via a line 11. It is mixed with substantially pure hydrogen introduced via a line 12 and the mixture having an H2 CO ratio in the range from 1.8 to 2.5 is passed via a line 13 to a hydrocarbon synthesis unit 14 where it is at least in part converted to hydrocarons. Noe ccnverted H2 and CO containing gas mixture together with low boiling hydrocarbons C1 C4 is withdrawn from the unit 14 via a line 15.Part of this gas mixture is introduced via a line 16 into a steam reforming unit 17 where it is converted with steam not shown into anH2 and Co containing gas mixture having a higher H2 CO ratio than the synthesis gas produced in the gasifier 4. Part of the gas mixture withdrawn fran the unit 14 via the line 15 is mixed with a CO containing stream introduced via a line 18 into a line 19 and the mixture is passed via the line 19 to the burners not shown of the steam reforming unit 17 where the mixture is burned in order to furnish the heat for the endothermic steam reforming reactions. The e synthesis gas produced in unit 17 is passed to a pressure swing adsorber 20 in which it is separated into a CO containing stream withdrawn via the line 18 and a H2 stream withdrawn via a line 21. Part of the H2 stream is passed via the line 12 to the line 13. An other part of the H2 stream is passed via a line 22 to a hydrocracking unit 23 where it is used for hydrocracking normally liquid hydrocarbons produced in the synthesis unit 14 and passed fran unit 14 to unit 23 through a line 24. The e hydrocracking product is passed fran the hydrocracking unit 23 via a line 25 to a fractional distillation unit 26 where it is separated into a normally gaseous stream containing non converted H2 and light hydrocarbons, a naphtha stream, a kerosene stream and a gasoil stream, which streams are withdrawn fran the system via lines 27, 28, 29 and 30 respectively.
