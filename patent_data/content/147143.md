## Description
This invention relates to a thin lightweight noiseless air cleaner having a high collection efficiency and an air cleaning system using the same. A sufficiently purified environment is required in precision machinery industries for the production of semiconductors, pharmaceutical industries, hospitals, research institutes in the field of biotechnology, etc.. Depending on the situation air quality might need to be controlled in a single bench area, in a regulated booth or even in an entire room. Air purification has been acomplished by, for example, an air cleaning system such as the one shown in Figure In addition, the filter module From US A 4,319,899 there is known an air cleaner provided with a transition duct and a plenum chamber of a specific shape designed to slow down the air travelling from the fan outlet to the air filter inlet of the air cleaner by expansion. From US A 3,780,503 there is known a clean air room, wherein each of a series of air filters served by a common air supply duct is provided with an air flow control valve containing moveable parts which allow the air flow through each of the air filters to be made equal. According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided an air cleaner comprising a thin lightweight fan module having a fan, a casing containing said fan therein and a housing containing said casing therein a thin lightweight air filter module having an air filter and a physical air flow moderator board disposed parallel to the back face of the air filter module and between said fan module and said air filter module, the board being connected along three of its sides to the walls of the housing so as to define a flow path between the fan and the board and between the board and the air filter in such a manner that the flow path area in front of the outlet of the fan is not immediately connected to the flow path area between the board and the air filter. The casing is, in a preferred embodiment, eccentrically positioned within said housing of the fan module to create a large space in front of the outlet of said fan casing. According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided an air cleaner comprising a pair of thin lightweight fan modules each of which has a fan, a casing containing said fan therein and a housing containing said casing therein a pair of thin lightweight air filter modules each of which has an air filter and a pair of physical air flow moderator boards each of which is disposed parallel to the back face of the air filter module and between said fan module and said air filter module, the board being connected along three of its sides to the walls of the housing so as to define a flow path between the fan and the board and between the board and the air filter in such a manner that the flow path area in front of the outlet of the fan is not immediately connected to the flow path area between the board and the air filter, wherein each of said casing is eccentrically positioned within said housing of the fan module to create a large space in front of the outlet of said fan casing, and said two each adjacent housings in which the fan casings face each other with respect to their outlets are divided by a partition in such a manner that the end portion of the outlet of the casing in the housing is connected by said partition to the end portion of the outlet of the other casing, thereby regulating the direction of each of the air flows from said fan casings. The housing is, in a preferred embodiment, provided with vibration and noise absorbers. The fan is preferably a propeller type fan or a sirocco fan. The fan is, in a preferred embodiment, provided with a resonance prevention device at its back. The resonance prevention device is, in a preferred embodiment, a flywheel. Thus, the invention described herein is advantageous as it 1 provides an air cleaner which has a high collection efficiency and an excellent ventilation ability 2 provides a noiseless air cleaner 3 provides an air cleaner, which is thin and lightweight 4 provides an air cleaner which produces a uniform rate of air flow 5 provides a small sized air cleaner which can be installed in a small space and 6 provides an air cleaning system which is composed of the above mentioned air cleaner and in which complete airtightness can be maintained. This invention may be better understood and its numerous objects and advantages will become apparent to those skilled in the art by reference to the accompanying drawings as follows Figures Figure Figures Figure Figure Figures Figures The air flow from the outlet Figure Figures Guide vanes This air cleaner Another air cleaner
