# Microencapsulated naturally occuring pyrethrins.

## Abstract
A process for microencapsulating naturally occurring pyrethrins with a polyamide polyurea shell by interfacial condensation which includes slowly adding an amine reac tant to an aqueous emulsion containing the pyrethrin, an isocyanate, and an acyl halide with the requirement that at least one of said isocyanate or said acyl halide is poly functional, to provide free flowing capsules having a polyamide polyurea wall encapsulating the natural pyre thrin.
