# Wraparound sleeve.

## Abstract
A wraparound sleeve 20 , preferably recoverable, has a profiled edge 24 which is enveloped when the closure is wrapped around an elongate substrate 8 . Repeating struc tural units 26 along the profiled edge 24 comprise spoiler edges 28 which run substantially at right angles to the edge, and cause air trapped along the edge to form into discrete pockets 30 .
