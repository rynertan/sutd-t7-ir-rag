## Description
This invention relates to a low density propping medium for propping fractures in oil or in gas wells. Since the late 1940 s when hydraulic fracturing of the formations adjacent oil wells was first practiced, it has been found necessary to inject solid granular propping agents into such formations to prevent closure of the fractures. Sand flint was apparently the first such solid propping agent to be employed. U.S. Patent 2,950,247 suggests the use of aluminum oxide spheres as propping agents. U.S. Patent 3,890,072, suggests the use of sintered bauxite spheres as an oil well proppant. U.S.Patent 4,068,718, teaches the use of sintered bauxite particles made according to the teaching of U.S. Patent 3,079,243 or 3,421,492 for oil well propping. U.S. Patent 3,967,138 suggests ttaluminaU proppants of a wide range of density and alumina content but contains no teaching of how the pellets are made and shows test results only for material having a density of 3.4 or greater. An improved method for producing sintered bauxite proppant material in spherical form is taught in AustralianPatent 521,930 published April 5, 1982. Canadian Patent 117,897 also teaches manufacture of sintered bauxite proppant having a density of greater than 3.57 g cc and suggests the addition of as much as 30 of clay or other additives to the bauxite prior to forming and firing. U.S. Patent 4,068,718, referred to above, requires a density of at least 3.4 g cc in the proppant in order to provide sufficient compressive strength. The compressive strength required in U.S. Patent 4,068,718 is such that the proppant does not lose more than 75 of its permeability when the compressive load is increased from 1,000 psi to 10,000 psi, by a standarized permeability test. In accordance with this invention, there is provided a low density generally spherical sintered ceramic proppant containing chemically combined aluminum and silicon for use in oil and gas wells having a chemically combined aluminum content, calculated as aluminum oxide, of from 60 to 85 by weight The proppant has a lower density than prior art bauxitic proppants while retaining sufficient strength to be useful and effective in most proppant applications.The proppant of the present invention has a density of less than 3.4 g cc and has greater permeability under high compressive stress than all ceramic or glass proppants of the prior art except some of the strongest of the sintered bauxite proppants of density greater than 3.4 g cc now available, and has a permeability ratio P10,000 P1,000 of at least geo3. That is, the permeability at 10,000 psi is at least 30 of the permeability at 1,000 psi. Lower density of the proppant is desirable in providing more volume of proppant per unit weight, that is, more permeability per pound of proppant, and. in enhanced handling properties A light weight proppant is easier to pump into the well and may be carried more readily into the cracks in the formation than a more dense proppant. The proppant of the present invention employs an additive in the amount of from 40 to 90 on an anhydrous basis, of a material such as the high aluminous clays identified below as a substitute for a portion of the bauxite in the proppant of Australian Patent 521,930.While other sources of minerals may be employed to achieve a composition of the same range of chemical constituents, the association of minerals i.e. combined alumina and silica in the form of hydrous alumino silicate clay materials in the high aluminous clays is particularly suitable for making the proppant of the present invention, in producing high strength in spite of the relatively low density as compared to prior art bauxite proppant. Although other known pelletization methods may be used, in the preferred method the mixture of milled bauxite and milled clay, together with minor amounts of organic or inorganic binder material for green strength is placed in an intensive mixer together with sufficient water for initiating the pelletizing process. After a period of mixing, additional dry mix is added and the pelletizing action is continued until spheres of the desired green size are formed. The pellets are then dried and fired at 1400 to 15000C. to produce the desired product. Except for the composition of the mix, the method employed is that disclosed in Australian Patent 521,930. The bauxite should be milled to a particle size such that the mass average diameter is no greater than 10, preferably less than 7 microns. The clay should be milled to a matching particle size. It is preferable to mix the bauxite calcined abrasive grade and the clay together, as received from the supplier, and to mill the mixture to the desired particle size. A clay found useful in this invention although termed bauxitic by the supplier, contains essentially all of its alumina in the form of hydrated alumino silicate clay mineral, not in the form of hydrated alumina. The clay contains 50 to 65 combined aluminum calculated asA12O3 and 28 to 42 combined silicon calculated as SiO2 .The clay contains well under 1 of alkali and alkaline earth elements and the major impurities in the clay are titania and iron, up to 7 total. Another clay form useful is a higher average alumina, lower silica content clay, having an alumina content calculated on A1203 of 63 to 67 , an alkali and alkaline earth content of under 1 , and a silica content of 18 to 25 all on an anhydrous basis . The finished product consists of substantially spherical ceramic particles having a density of less than 3.4 g cc, preferably 2.8 to 3.3 g cc, most preferably 3.0 to 3.2 g cc, an alumina content of 60 to 85 , preferably 65 to 75 , a silica content of 10 to 30 , preferably 18 to 28 and an iron content calculated as Fe2O3 of fron 3 to 7 . The alumina and silica are present in the form of mullite with minor amounts of alpha alumina and glass, when the lower alumina clay is used, and in the form of mullite and alpha alumina when higher alumina clays are used. Examples I and II An Eirich R7 high intensity mixer available fromMaschinenfabrik Gustav Eirich, Nordbaren, Federal Republic of Germany was employed using a standard pin type mixing tool. The mix consisted of 35 pounds of a milled mixture of 50 calcined bauxite and 50 high aluminous clay, and 0.6 pounds of cereal starch. These ingredients were mixed dry at high speed for two minutes. Then 13 pounds of water was added with mixing at high speed continuing for two minutes, at which time the mixing was switched to slow speed for about 30 seconds. The 16 pounds of dry powder mix of bauxite and calcined bauxitic clay was added at the rate of 2 to 3 pounds per minute. After the addition was com pleted, mixing was continued for 30 seconds and the thus formed green spherical pellets were dumped from the mixer, dried, and fired at 1480 to 15000C. for 45 minutes. One batch Batch 1B , prepared according to the above procedure in which the clay and bauxite were wet milled for 20 hours in a vibratory mill, and in which the proppant was fired at 15000C., had a sphere density of 3.17 g cc, and was at least as resistant to severe acid conditions as conventional sintered bauxite proppant a test for acid resistance is described in an A.P.I. proposed standard entitled Recommended Practice for Testing Sand Used in Rydraulic Fracture Operations of August 1981 . The product contained mullite as the major phase with minor amounts of alpha alumina. Using the same procedures with a batch 19018 in which the raw materials were milled 5 hours and fired in the 1480 to 15000C range, resulted in a sphere density of 3.1 g cc and an acid resistance at least equal to that of sintered bauxite proppant. Permeability values measured on 25 30 sized material about 700 microns were as follows Applied Stress Permeability Permeability RatioBatch psi Darcies 10,000 1,000 1B 2,000 344 235 360 .65 4,000 303 6,000 295 8,000 272 10,000 235 12,000 178 15,000 97 9018 2,000 425 230 460 0.50 4,000 411 6,000 391 8,000 298 10,000 230 12,000 179 15,000 77 The permeability test is the brine KC1 test described in the Journal of Petroleum Technology, September 1973, pages 1101 1107, by C. E. Cooke.Examples III and IV In a further reduction to practice of the invention a differente source of clay was used, and two different proppant compositions were made according to the procedures of Examples I and II. In the first example 90 of uncalcined clay was mixed with 10 bauxite, and in the second, 80 uncalcined clay and 20 bauxite was employed. The clay which actually contained about 30 H2O analysis, on an anhydrous basis, uses as follows Clay of Examples III, IV on dry basis SiO2 22.49 Foe 203 7.37 TiO2 3.95 CaO 0.04 MgO 0.04 Na2O 0.03 A1203 by diff 65.7 The fired proppant of the 90 10 composition had a crush strength superior to that of Examples I and II. The fired proppant of the 80 20 composition has a crush strength superior to that of the 90 10 composition, indicating a higher permeability than the 90 10 mix and the proppant of Examples I and II. Both proppants of Examples III and IV consisted essentially of polycrystalline mullite bodies. Typical analysis ranges on a calcined basin for the bauxite and for the high aluminous clays used are Components Bauxite Aluminous Clay SiO2 2.8 3.5 18 42 TiO2 3.0 3.6 2.0 3.8 Fe203 3.5 5.5 1.8 12 CaO 0.05 0.1 .03 0.1 MgO 0.05 0.1 .03 0.1 Na2O 0.04 0.06 .01 .06Al203 by Diff 85 90 50 67Loss on Ignition 1.4 1 6 Powder X ray diffraction of the clays shows strong peaks for hydrated alumino silicates and no significant peaks for alpha alumina. In the calcined bauxite the alumina is in the form of alpha alumina or its hydrated alumina precursors. The broad limits in the finished fired product, not preferred, but considered within the invention are as follows Al203 60 to 85 SiO2 10 to 30 Foe 0 2 to 10 Except for TiO2 which may be present up to 3 or 4 , other metal oxides, such as the alkali and alkaline earth elements are present in amounts of less than 1 . Except for its presence in minor glassy phases, essentially all of the silica is in combined form in the mullite phase.
