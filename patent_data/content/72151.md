## Abstract
A pulse transformer 3 is used in a radar transmitter to transform a high current pulse at relatively low voltage into a very high voltage pulse which can be used to directly drive a magnetron oscillator 4 . The potential of the output pulse can be of the order of 30 kV and since the transformer is required to operate at very high peak powers of the order of two mega watts, it must be very carefully designed to avoid excessive electrical losses and voltage breakdown. The core material of the transformer consists of a closely wound reel of magnetic material in the form of an elongate tape which is mechanically fragile. The magnetic core 31 is loosely mounted within a sealed container so that the primary 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 and secondary 35 windings surround it. A conductive shield 36 is placed around the magnetic material so as to protect it from the very large electric fields generated within the transformer. This prevents the ionisation of gases which could lead to the rapid deterioration of the magnetic core material.
