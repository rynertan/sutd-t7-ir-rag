# Flexible magnetic data storage disk jacket assemblies.

## Abstract
To reduce the risk of contamination by pieces of the wiper lining becoming detached, the transducing apertures 511 513 , in the wiper lining 502, 503, 504, 505 of a flexible magnetic data storage disk jacket assembly, are cut to larger dimensions than the jacket apertures 28X registering there with are punched to. Preferably the wiper lining is cut into two parallel separated strips, and after the fixing of the strips to the jacket blank 118 X the blank is punched in the aperture defined by the gap between the strips. A single wiper lining aperture can accommodate two registered jacket apertures which can be off centre with respect to the wiper lining aper ture.
