# Accident prevention apparatus.

## Abstract
Accident prevention apparatus for mounting on a machine, tractor or other apparatus having at least one mov ing part driven by a power source the accident prevention apparatus comprises, in electrical circuit, an elongate contact sensitive antenna 11 , movement sensitive means 8,12,13 and means including a solenoid 17 to cut off power from the power source. The movement sensitive means 8,12,13 includes a mounting 8 and a plate 13 spaced apart and insulated from each other, the antenna 11 being rooted to the mounting 8 to extend therefrom through a hole 14 in plate 13 and therebeyond to extend in the vicinity of the moving part. Contact with the antenna 11 by the operator s clothing causes it to touch the plate 13 which actuates the solenoid 17 to cut off power to the machine or to the moving part of the machine.
