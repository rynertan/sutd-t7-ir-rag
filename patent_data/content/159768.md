# FIBER OPTIC CRIMPING TOOL

## Abstract
An optical fiber 30 with a bare end portion is faced off precisely at 90 degrees. With an unsecured ferrule 37 loosely located on the fiber, the fiber is passed through over size openings in a fiber holder 47 and a crimping station 45 . The bare fiber portion is located in the interstice of three rods 33 having identical diameters and the assembly is re leasably held by jaws in a holding station 44 . The faced off fiber end is positioned slightly inwardly from the end faces of the rods by a limit pin 55 . The fiber holder is tightened onto the fiber to maintain it in straightened condition and the fer rule is then slid into place over the three rods and included fiber. The crimping station is moved along a track toward the holding station until crimping jaws 76 78 are positioned about the ferrule, three rods and fiber. Crimping jaws deform the ferrule at several different places firmly securing it in place on the rods.
