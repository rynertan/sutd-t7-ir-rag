## Abstract
Apparatus for use in the manufacture of socketed ther moplastics pipe by the radial expansion of a pipe blank. The apparatus includes an openended central mould portion 12 which can be raised or lowered on stanchions 10, 11 to three predetermined positions a pair of mould end portions 15, 17 each having a supporting mandrel 19, 20 engageable with the pipe blank 28, end portions 15, 17 being advanceable to and re tractable from the central mould portion 12. One of the mould end portions 15 is internally contoured to provide part of the socket forming portion of the mould. The mould end portions 15, 17 can be held in an intermediate position, partially ad vanced towards the central portion 12 to locate the blank 28 on mandrels 10, 20 before closing of the mould.
