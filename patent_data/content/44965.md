# Catalyst and process for simultaneous hydrotreating and hydrodewaxing of hydrocarbons.

## Abstract
Catalyst and process for simultaneously hydrotreating and hydrodewaxing hydrocarbons for the catalytic treat ment of hydrocarbons in the presence of hydrogen, and under conditions of elevated temperature and pressure, by way of providing catalyst compositions and process condi tions for selectively hydrocracking the waxy paraffins and substantially reducing organosulfur and organonitrogen compounds in hydrocarbon feedstocks. The catalyst com position comprises a group VI B metal component on a support essentially consisting of a porous refractory oxide and a crystalline silica.
