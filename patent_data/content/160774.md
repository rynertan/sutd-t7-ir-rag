# A process for the purification of water.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a process for decreasing the contents of iron and manganese in ground water or surface water flowing through an aquifer or through a basin or a filter containing naturally occurring filter material. Water containing oxygen or oxygen releasing substances is intro duced intermittently through a number of injection wells or injection pipes 1 9 arranged around an extraction well or extraction pipe 10 for purified water. During each introduc tion of oxygen containing water said water is fed to only some of said injection wells or pipes 1 9 and simultaneous ly water is drawn from nearby, adjacent or intervening injection wells or pipes 1 9 .
