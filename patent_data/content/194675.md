# Magnetic recording media.

## Abstract
Magnetic recording media has protective layer 14 made of high hardness carbon synthesized under a low temperature and a low pressure by blowing hydrocarbon gas plasma to magnetic recording layer 15 and wear resistance thereof is made large, therefore high density magnetic recording is realized by magnetic recording system wherein magnetic head contacts with the magnetic record ing media, and further durability of the magnetic recording media is much improved.
