## Description
METHOD AND CO tSOSlTION FOR REDUCING THE STRENGTH OF ICE This invention is directed to reducing the strength of adhesion of solid particulate materials obtained under freezing conditions by ice formation between particles.In particular, this invention is directed to the addition te the surface Oj solid inorganic particulate materials of a composition which causes weakening and collapsing of inter particulate ice bonds that form. in the material, such weakening and collapsing occurring in many cases when a stress is applied, typically from the weight of a mass of the particles. In particular, this invention is specially adapted to the treatment of particulate coal to enhance its bulk handling characteristics under low temperature i.e., freezing conditions. There is described in the literature the usc of a number cf compositions for reducing the interbonding effect of ice formation between particulate materials.In U.S. Patent No. 4,117,214 to Parks and Nimerick, there is described the use of a composition of a water soluble polyhydroxy compound or monoalkylether thereof and b a water soluble organic non volatile compound having a hydro philic group, such as amine, carboxyl or carboxylate, in an amount which is effective to weaken the physical integrity of ice when added to water prior to its being frozen. Such a composition can be applied to inorganic particulate masses which contain water and when the masses are subjected to freezing conditions, the composition becomes incorporated into tho ice formed and renders the ice physically weak when the mass has to be separated.This can be demonstrated by the fragility imparted to an Ice cube, see Procedure A , infra. The patent, in particular, is concerned with the treatment of coal placed in hopper cars so that.when c oal is transported under freezing weather conditions, the ice does not adversely affect one s ability to remove the coal from the hopper cars. In this respect, the patent refers to an article in Business Week, February 14, 1977, pages 32 34, to characterize the severity of the freezing problem as it applies to the transportation of inorganic particulate materials, in particular, coal. The particular compos4tion which this patent indicates to be the most desirable for use in the treat went of coal subjected to freezing weather conditions is a blend of 47.5 wt. 7o ethylene glycol, 47.5 wt. 7 propylene glycol, and 5 wt. sodium acetate. The patentees also describe in broader terms the kind of composition which they regard as capable of affecting the cohesive strength of ice formed about solid parti culate materials. One of the ingredients, according to the patent, is a polyhydroxy alkane and typical members of that class are ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, glycerine, and sugar.Of those, ethylene glycol is indicated as preferred. In addition, the patentees mention that a mixture of those glycols may be employed as a first component of the total composition and illus tractive of that is a mixture such as ethylene glycol and 1,2 propylene glycol. The second material which is used in the compos4tion for treating the particulates is a water soluble organic non volatile compound . Although this compound is extremely broadly defined, the specific illustrations set forth in the patent are materials such as fumaric acid, used, glycol acid, the tetrasodium salt of ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid, sodium acetate and acetic acid. The polneric materials described are polyacrylamide, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyethyleneimine, polyacrylates, polyamide copolymers, such as that sold commercially as Arco S 232, and the natural gums, such as guar gum. A factor in distinguishing the process of U.S.Patent No. 4,117,214 from what had been utilized in the prior art in ice treatments involves the quantity of the treating agent that the patentees supply to the particulate mass to prevent the kind of ice formation which precludes the breaking apart of a particulate mass.The patentees use less of the treating agent than is normally employed in antifreeze conditions or in deicing situations. The compositions of the present invention can impart a higher degree of fragility to ice formed in the particulate mass than can the compositions described in U.S.Patent No. 4,117,214 and the present compositions represent.an improvement over said prior art composition. Also, the compositlons of this invention have a lower viscosity.than the compositions described in U.S. Patent No. 4,117,214.This lower viscosity facilitates spraying the compositions onto the particulate matter. The lower viscosity also permits greater penetration of the compositions into the particulate matter, such as coal. This invention is directed to compositions for the treatment of particulate matter subjectable to water freezing conditions which comprises a liquid solution of a mixture of at least one glycol derived from ethylene oxide and containing from 1 to 4 oxyethylene units and at least one alkyl and or an aryl ether of a glycol derived from ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide and containing from 1 to 9 oxyalkylene units. The solution may also contain propylene glycol and or water. The glycol derived from ethylene oxide and containing from 1 to 4 oxyethylene units includes ethylene glycol, dlethyleneglycol, triethylene glycol, and tetraethylene glycol, and mixtures thereof, with ethylene glycol being preferred. The alkyl and or aryl ether of a glycol derived from ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide and containing from L to 9 oxyalkylene units is selected from one or more compounds of the following formulae EMI4.1 wherein R is alkyl, aryl, alkylaryl or arylalkyl containing 1 to 15 carbon atoms, and n is an integer of from 1 to 9. The preferred alkyl ether of a glycol is ethylene glycol ethylether and has the following formula CH3CF20CH2CR20H. This ether is commercially available under the designation Cellosolve Solvent sold by UnionCarbide Corporation . The mixture of this invention contains from aboutG5 to about 95, preferably from about 75 to about 85 weight percent of ethylene glycol and or propylene glycol and from about 1 to about 25, preferably from about 10 to about 20 weight percent of the alkyl and or aryl ether of a glycol. The composition may also contain water. The water may be present in amounts of up to about 30 weight percent, preferably from about 5 to about 10 weight percent, of the total weight of the composition. The preferred composition contains ethylene glycol, ethylene glycol ethylether, and water. The amount of the composition of this invention which is typically supplied to the inorganic mass is about 0.5 wt. ,or less, based upon moisture content in the inorganic particulate mass being treated. Large amounts can be employed but they are not ordinarily required. The amount to use can be determined by measuring the moisture content of the inorganic particulate mass see e.g., ASTM D 3302 74 and supplying to that nass,in an uniform manner, the composition of this invention in the amount which test data shows to provide the desired amount of fragility or brittleness to the particulate mass when brought to a frozen state.The degree of fragility imparted to the ice which is formed by utilizing the compositions of this invention has been proved according to laboratory tests to be significantly greater than that which is achieved utilizing the most desirable composition of U.S. Patent No. 4,117,214, to wit, 47.5 wt. X ethylene glycol, 47.5 wR. propylene glycol, and 5 wt. sodium acetate. In the practice of this invention it may be dendr able to add a corrosion inhibitor, such as triethanol amine, or methyl diethanol amlnes provided, e.g., in amounts of from about 0.05 to 1 weight per cent, based on the weight of the composition. Various methods may be used to supply the composi tions of this invention to the particulate mass Standard treating procedures employed in the art for spraying a liquid uniformly onto a particulate mass may be employed.For example, the composition may be sprayed across a zone through which a stream of the particles to be treated is passed. A particular illustration of this would be to place an annular tube above a hopper car that is being loaded with the particulate mass. The tuba contains a multiplicity of spray heads timed at the interior area circumscribed by the tube and the tube acts as 8 manifold for the solution fed to the spray heads. The solution of the composition is fed to the tube at a rate to supply the desired amount of the composition on the particulate mass to be treated. The wass of particul tes are fed through the tube into the hopper car.Another technique involves praying the top of a mass of the particles and wallowing the composition to drain through the mass to cover particles at the bottom as well. Another technique involves dropping the particles onto a trough which feeds the particles to a hopper car or to n storage facility. While the particles run down the trough they are sprayed with e solution of the compo ition of this invention. EXAMPLES The following sets forth embodiments of this invention and is not intended to act to limit this in vention. PROCEDURES A PREPARATION AND TESTING OF ICE CUEE SPECIMENS. Ice samples were prepared by first dissolving the desired percentage by weight of the chosen chemicals into standard water for a total solution weight of 40.00 grams. Standard water is prepared by allowing laboratory tap water to deaerate and equilibrate at room temperature 23 C. for at least 24 hours before use. The water solution was poured into leveled polyolefin molds with interior dimensions 1.50 inchcs 3.80 cm. x 1.15 inches 2.92 cm at the bottom and 1.88 inches 3.80 cm. x 1.50 inches 3.80 cm at the open top, with an interior height of 1.42 inches 3.60 cm , and frozen at lO C. The ice remained in the mold for 18 to 24 hours before being removed for testing. The compressive strength of there ice cubes was promptly determined using an Instron Model TTC physical testing device after being gently removed fron their mold. The ice cubes were inverted between stainless steel plates of the lOD Ib. 453.59 kg. cell of the tester and the plates were closed by n electric drive et a rate of 5 inches .7 cm. minute. The pressure at which the ice broke was recorded. B PREPARATION AND TESTING OF PACKED COALSPECIMENS. The effect of moisture content on the compressive strength of frozen particulate masses of coal was demonstrated. The coal employéd was 3 8 inch passed 3 8 inch mesh 0.9525 cm mesb Eastern metallurgical type coal. The coal was air dried and the amount of water required to obtain 10 by wt. surface moisture was calculated by material balance. The desired agent was added to the water and the agent and water were thoroughly mixed to form a treating solution. Sixty gram samples of the coal particles were spread out as a monolayer on a sheet of polyethylene film. The treating solution was applied dropwise uniformly across the monolayer with a laboratory syringe and then the coal was dry blended with spatulas.until the solution and coal were uniformly blended. The coal was added to a 5 oz. 147.87 cc. wax paper cup 2.75 inches 6.985 cm. high with a bottom diameter of 1.75 inches 4.445 cm. and a top diameter of 2.375 inches 6.0325 cm. . The treated samples were hand packed and compacted wjth a wooden tamper to a height of 1.57 inches 3.9878 cm. in each cup. The top of each container was covered with aluminum foil and the sealed containers were allowed to stand at room temperature for 24 hours prior to freezing at 10N for 18 to 24 hours.Each container was removed from the freezer and gently peeled uway from the coal frozen inside. The compressive strength of the coal specimen was promptly determined using the Instron procedure dscrSbed in A above. Control. A This Control illustrates a composition as set forth in U.S. Patent 4,117,214. The composition was a liquid mixture of 47.5 weight percent of ethylene glycol, 47.5 weight percent of propylene glycol and 5.0 weight percent of sodium acetate. The viscosity of this composition was measured in a standard Viscometer at 20 C, OOC, and 20 C and found to be 44,148 and 880 centistokes, respectively. The data is summarized in Table I. This mixture was added in concentrations of 0.25, 0.50, and 1.0 weight percent to water and the water was frozen as described in Procedure A above. The compressive strength psi of the ice was then determined by the method of Procedure A and is set forth in Table II.The numerical value of the compressive strength is the average of the number of specimens tested, and is set forth in Table II Table II also shows the percent reduction of compressive strength of the composition as compared to that of ice, which is 152 psi based o the average of 250 tested specimens . Control B This Control Illustrates another prior art composition. The composition was a liquid mixture of 65 wt. diethylene glycol, 20 wt. methyl ether of dipropylene glycol, 10 wt. of the average 7 mole ethylene oxide adduct of mixed 11 15 carbon secondary alkanols, and 5 wt. water. This mixture was added in concentrations of 0.25, 0.50 and 1.0 weight percent to water, the water frozen and tested as described in Control A. The number of specimens tested, average compressive strength of these specimens and the percent reduction of the compressive strength as compared to that of ice, is set forth in Table II. Example I The composition was a liquid mixture of 80 weight percent of ethylene glycol, 15 weight percent of ethylene glycol nonoethyl ether and 5 weight percent water. The viscosity of this composition was measured in a standard Viscometer at 200C, 0 C, and 20 C and found te be 13, 36 and 111 centistokes, respectively. The data is summarized in Table I This liquid mixture was added in concentrations of 0.25, 0.50 and 1.0 weight percent to water, the water frozen, and tested as described in Control A. The number of specimens tested, average compressive strength of these specimens and the percent reduction of the compressive strength as compared to that of ice, is set forth in Table II. Table I Viscosity in centistokes at Example 20 0 20 oC Control A 44 148 880 1 13 36 111 The data in Table I shows that the composition of this invention has significantly lower viscosity than the composition of U.S Patent 4,L17,214. Therefore, due to the lower viscosity of the composition of this invention, it can more easily be sprayed onto coal and it also penetrates the coal to a greater extent.
