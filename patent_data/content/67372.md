## Abstract
An adsorptive separation method capable of effectively separating the desired component from a mixture containing the same at a high purity and a high recovery ratio, and easily which copes with scale up of the apparatus is disclosed. This method comprises alternately supplying a starting mixture A, comprising a plurality of substances, and a desorbent into a column packed with an adsorbent, treating to form and move an adsorption band of the starting mixture A and recovering the intended component at a purity higher than the aimed purity from an eluate, wherein after the entire amount of the intended component passing through the column is increased over the amount of the intended component in the starting mixture A and the intended component is separated and recovered, the portion B which is at least a part of the remaining intended component containing portion, and in which the desorbent is separated and removed to a concentration lower than the desorbent concentration in the starting mixture A and the intended component is contained at a concentration higher than the concentration of the intended component in the starting mixture A is mixed with the starting material A and supplied to the column or said portion B and the starting mixture A are supplied to the column one by one, and then, the desorbent is supplied successively.
