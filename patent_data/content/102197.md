The tool sections 18, 20 are mountable on and removable from the body 12 without disconnecting either end of the tool 10 from a drill stem 11 . The half sleeve tool sections 18, 20 are provided with tapered axially extending flanges 30, 36 on their opposite ends which fit in corresponding tapered recesses 32 62, 16 formed on the tool body 12 and the tool sections 18, 20 are retained on the body 10 by a locknut 52 threadedly engaged with the body 12 and engageable with an axially movable retaining collar 50 . The tool sections 18, 20 may be drivably engaged with axial keys 44 formed on the body 12 or the tool sections 94, 96 may be formed with flat surfaces 136 on the sleeve inner sides cooperable with complementary flat surfaces 84 formed on a reduced diameter portion 82 of the body 72 around which the tool sections 94, 96 are mounted.
