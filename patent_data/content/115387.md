# Decarbonylation process.

## Abstract
An alcohol and carbon monoxide are produced by the decarbonylation of an alkyl formate in the presence of, as catalyst, i a Lewis base and epoxide or 2 an amidine or a guanidine. When the Lewis base used is a trivalent phos phorus compound, for example a phosphine, it is preferable to have alcohol present at the start of the reaction.
