# Process for the production of pseudocumene or durene.

## Abstract
A process for producing pseudocueme or durene is described, comprising methylating xylene by the use as a catalyst of at least one crystalline silicate selected from the group consisting of crystalline borosilicate, fluorine containing crystalline borosilicate, fluorine containing crys talline aluminosilicate, and fluorine containing crystalline boroaluminosilicate. The specific crystalline silicate catalyst increases the conversion of xylene and the selectivity of pseudocumene or durene. The process of the invention can be performed either in one step or in two steps. The two step reaction provides various industrial advantages, such as a high degree of utilization of the methylating agent and a great increase in the selectivity of the product.
