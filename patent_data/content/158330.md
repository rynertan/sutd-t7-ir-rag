# MOTOR VEHICLE LIGHTING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A lighting system for a motor vehicle including a plurality of replaceable, sealed lighting modules and means for mounting the modules in the vehicle in a pair of spaced apart linear, horizontally disposed arrays. Each array possesses a maximum height of only about two inches and a width greater than the array height. All of the modules are similar and each includes a reflector with a lighting capsule mounted therein. The front of the module is enclosed by means of a optically clear cover exclusive of lens elements. A lens means is separately mounted in front of each array of lighting modules for controlling the light emmitted therefrom to in turn provide both high and low beam patterns for the vehicle. Each of the arrays comprises four similar modules, resulting in a system containing a total of eight such components.
