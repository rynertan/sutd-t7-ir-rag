# Video signal time axis correction apparatus.

## Abstract
A time axis of a digital video signal is converted to standard time axis by changing a clock signal contained therein to a standard clock signal and by locking phases of input synchronizing signals contained therein onto the phase of the standard clock signal through a memory for alternately writing and reading the digital video signal at one half of the period of the standard clock signal. As a result, the time axis correction of the digital video signal is efficiently effected through the memory having a small capacity and a simplified controlling arrangement.
