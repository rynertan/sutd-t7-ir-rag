# Viscous fluid clutch and reservoir by pass valve therefor.

## Abstract
A viscous fan clutch is typically employed in a fan drive mechanism within a truck or automobile. A shaft 12 , driven by the engine, rotates a clutch member 24 within the fan drive. The clutch member is arranged for fluid engagement with a body member 38 for the transmission of torque thereto when fluid is disposed in an operating chamber defined by complimentary shear surfaces 30,64 in the clutch and body members. During relative rotation between the two members, fluid is pumped through a return passage 76,78 to a valve 97 coaxially disposed with the driven shaft which selectively directs a flow of viscous fluid alternately to a stor age chamber 73 or directly back into the operating chamber. The valve is biased into a first position in which the fluid is directed into the fluid storage chamber and is actuated into the second position by means of a coaxially disposed sol enoid 120 acting upon ferrous metal members of the valve. When the valve is in the second position, a port is opened for fluid communication between the fluid storage chamber and the operating chamber.
