## Description
Cathodic Protection Using Conductive Polymer Concrete The present invention is a polymer concrete that can be applied to the surface of a bridge deck or other concrete structure and carry an impressed current to protect the reinforcing steel from corrosion. This requires that the polymer first be compatible with the concrete. A primary area of compatibility is coefficient of thermal expansion if the coefficient of thermal expansion of the polymer is different from that of concrete, the polymer must be sufficiently flexible to dissipate thermal stresses. As an example of this, a certain rigid polymer was used to attach lane markers to a concrete highway. The coefficient of expansion of the polymer was different from that of concrete, and the cured polymer was too hard to stretch or compress to absorb the difference in expansions.As a result, after a period of months the polymer, which bonded firmly to the concrete, broke the layer of concrete under it away from the rest of the concrete the lane marker thus was loose on the highway, still attached to the thin layer of concrete that it was initially applied to. Another requirement is that the cured polymer be able to withstand the rigors of traffic driving over it day after day. This requires that it retain some flexibility when subjected to cold temperatures so that it does not crack when pounded by hcavy trucks, but not become too soft in summer. Another requirement is that the polymer bond to the concrete and not be loosened by the freeze thaw cycles that it is ultimately exposed to in winter. As stated earlier, the purpose of the polymer is to carry current as part of a cathodic protection system for the reinforcing steel. A polymer is Inore desireable in this application thaji portland cement concrete, because the polymer is more resistant to acid attack. The prior art shows many examples of polymers that have conductive particles in them which are used as floor coverings for static electricity buildup suppression. It has been found that while these polymers may be cffective in preventing static electricity buildup, they are sometimes totally unsuitable for use in the environment of the present invention, which is a bridge deck, roadway, or other reinforced concrete member.It has been found that when a sample of an epoxy is immersed in salt water, to simulate the conditions which exist in winter due to the presence of deicing chemicals on the bridge deck, and then used as a current carrying part of an electric circuit, the chlorine that is generated destroys the epoxy. The test set up put 1 amp of current at 6 volts through the conductive epoxy for two days, and the epoxy was destroyed by the chlorine formed. Thus the prior art does not recognise that epoxy, as opposed to polyester or vinyl ester, resins are destroyed when used to carry current in an environment that includes a chloride containing salt. Another requirement is that the cured polymer concrete have as low an electrical resistance as possible in order to reduce the voltage that has to be applied to it and or the thickness of material which must be used. The conductivity is primarily a function of the particles added to the polymer, although as will be shown applicants have found that the properties of the polymer itself play a significant role in this. The prior art shows many different types of particles that can be added to polyester and epoxy resins to get low resistance, but no examples were found of a cured polymer that was used to carry currents of the order of 1 amp or more and which had the extremely low resistance of the polymer of the present invention. According to the present invention, there is provided a method of cathodically protecting reinforcing steel in concrete which includes impressing an electrical current from at least one anode to the reinforcing steel, characterized in that the anode is formed at least in part by mixing thoroughly a conductive particulate material and an uncured polymer resin selected from a group of polymer resins which compact the particulate material upon curing thus rendering the anode significantly more conductive, curing such polymer resin to form a cured polymer, and then impressing such current between the anode and reinforcing steel. There is particularly disclosed herein a polyester or vinyl ester resin having carbon particles distributed within it which is used to carry electric current the resin is applied to abridge deck or other reinforced concrete structure and is used in an impressed current cathodic protection circuit as one of the current carrying members. The resins have the proper physical properties which allow them to bemused on portland cement concrete, and are very resistant to destruction by the acid and the chlorine gas formed when used in the presence of chloride containing salts. The invention will be better understood from the following non limiting description of examples thereof given with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figures la, ib and ic show the placement of the conductive polymer on a road surface or bridge deck. Figure 2 shows the deterioration of a sample of epoxy resin when used as described herein. Figure 3 shows the location of the reinforcing steel in a test slab that the cathodic protection system of the present invention was tested on. Figure 4 shows the location of the test points in the slab ofFigure 3. Figure 5 shows the placement of anodes in a section of bridge deck. Figure 6 shows the performance of the cathodic protection system of Figure 5. Figure 7 shows the placement of anodes in a system that did not utilize a conductive overlay. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Figure la shows a cross section of a bridge deck or roadway that has the present invention applied to it. The portland cement concrete portion 10 is of conventional construction, comprising portland cement concrete 12 with reinforcing steel members 14 within it. On top of this is placed a relatively thin of the order 0.1 inch layer of the polymer concrete 16 of the present invention having primary anodes 18 within it. Polymer concrete layer 16 is part of an impressed current cathodic protection system not shown which is designed to prevent the deterioration of the reinforcing steel members 14 within the portland cement concrete. Figure lb shows an alternative method of placing anodes 18. In this method, slots 19 are cut in the existing surface and anodes 18 are placed in the slots. The slots are then filled with conductive polymer, and the surface is covered with a thin layer of conductive polymer as in Figure la or a coat of conductive paint may be applied as in the example of Figures 3 and 4. Conductive paint can be used where the surface is not subjected to abrasion from foot or vehicle traffic the side of a retaining wall, for example . Figure lc shows another alternative, the close spacing of anodes primary anode metal or carbon strand and conductive polymer concrete to eliminate the need for a continuous conductive layer on the surface. As is well known in the art, the deterioration of the members 14 is due to the formation of natural electric currents which result from the penetration of chloride salts and the different electrical potentials along the members 14 within the portland cement concrete 12. Stopping of the deterioration can be achieved by impressing a current on the reinforcing steel and making all the steel in the concrete cathodic, thus neutralizing the naturally occurring electric currents. Primary anodes 18 carry the impressed current, and polymer concrete 16 distributes this current evenly to the reinforcing steel of the bridge deck or roadway thus providing the couple between the existing concrete and the primary anode. It is obvious that primary anodes 18 could be incorporated within the body of portland cememt concrete 12 in new construction. Applicants invention, however, is intended for use on existing structures in these applications it is difficult or impossible to reconstruct the bridge or road, hence the impressed current carrying part of the circuit must be an overlay on the existing surface or in slots placed in the existing surface. Further, acid is formed near the primary anode 18. This will destroy the portland cement concrete, whereas the polymer concrete is immune to such destruction.Such acid attack of a portland cement based anode backfill material resulted in deterioration of the backfill and exposure of the anode wire in tests on large slabs and on bridge decks after only several months of use. Although the prior art shows many examples of polymer concretes i.e., cured polyester or epoxy resins that have conductive particles in them and are stated to be used in seemingly analogous applications, applicants have found that most epoxy resins are destroyed when used to carry currents needed in cathodic protection systems. Figure 2 shows an example of this destruction. A sample of Nildepoxy concrete injection epoxy product number 3 epoxy resin , manufactured by RockyMountain Chemical Co., P.O. Box 2494, Casper, WY 82602, was cast with copper wires in it as the primary anodes. It also contained calcined fluid petroleum coke obtained from C.E.Equipment Co., Ilattiesburg, MS 39401 , the preferred particulate material for imparting electrical conductivity.After two days of carrying 1 amp of current at 6.0 volts while partially immersed in a solution of 3 sodium chloride to simulate the conditions which result from the application of deicing chemicals in winter , the resin was in the condition shown. The deterioration of the epoxy resin has been determined to be a result of attack by the nascent chlorine formed by the passage of current through the resin, the chlorine coming from the deicing salt in the water.Since existing bridge decks contain the chloride salt in the concrete already and will receive more salt to eliminate icing conditions in winter, a resin overlay or primary anode encapsulent will also be subject to this condition and clearly the epoxy resins are not suitable for use. Polyester resins, by contrast, show little deterioration after 16 days under the same conditions of current and salt solution. Since this current level is much higher than would be used in practice, it is felt that the test shows that polyester resins are suitable for long term use. Further, vinyl ester resins have been found to be even more resistant to degradation and thus can be used in high current density applications. As stated above, calcined fluid petroleum coke is the preferred particulate material for imparting electrical conductivity. However, this material does not produce the desired results when used with all resins. For epoxies in general, the resulting conductivities were unacceptably high from 30.7 to 5.5 million ohm cm when mixed with calcined fluid petroleum coke . In another case, when calcined fluid petroleum coke was added to methyl methacrylate resin without any other aggregate such as sand, the resin did not set harden . When sand or other fine aggregate was added along with the coke, the material became an insulator it had a resistance in excess of 64 million ohm cm .Applicants found one epoxy resin which gave marginally acceptable resistivity, Epi Rez 510 made by Celanese Plastics and Specialty Co., 1065 West Hill Street, P.O. Box 8248, Louisville, KY 40208 , which when mixed with toluene and a curing agent and coke gave a resistivity of 3 4 ohm cm. However, as shown above, epoxy resins do not withstand the attack by chlorine gas which results from the passage of current in the presence of deicing chemicals. Applicants have found that the preferred polymer resins and in particular the most preferred polyester and vinyl ester resins do not produce acceptably low resistivities when used with carbon additives other than calcined fluid petroleum coke. As the following table shows, the resistivity of a polyester resin polymer concrete varies considerably with the carbon additive ADDITIVE RESISTIVITY OHM CM 1 5 DAYS 120 DAYS 1.

The reason that the preferred combinations work so much better than other combinations is thought to be a result of two things which combine in such a way that they reinforce each other. The first is that the calcined fluid petroleum coke absorbs approximately 18 resin the second is that the preferred resins shrink as they harden.When these two effects are combined, the result is that the particles are pressed together in such a way that intimate particle to particle contact is achieved. The fact that conductivity is a function of particle to particle contact can be demonstrated if the dry coke is tamped into a mold, it has a resistivity of 62.7 ohm cm if hand pressure is then applied to the coke, the resistivity drops to 3.84 ohm cm, presumably a result of the greater contact pressure of the cured resin.Further evidence of this is the decrease in resistance of the preferred polyester resin as it cures, as shown in the following table Minutes after Pouring Resin Resistance Across 4 Feet of Resin Ohms 13 280 20 255 29 170 36 115 40 89.5 42 71.2 45 47.5 52 32.2 58 26.2 68 20.5 82 15.3 105 11.7In addition, continuity of the carbon with a particle, particle shape, and gradation also play important roles. Although the exact criteria for good conductivity are not known, applicants have found that only the calcined fluid petroleum cokes possess them.Mix Trials and Resistivity Beams Various mix trials were performed in a manner not open to the public to determine the resin and coke contents needed for trowelable and pourable conductive polymer concretes.

The top mat reinforcing steel in the slab was corroding due to the intrusion of chloride into the concrete during 7 years of daily salting. The polyester resin trowelable mix with all coke aggregate Mix 1 in Table A was utilized as the slot fill material slot size approximately 0.5 inch x 0.5 inch and after set, a layer of conductive paint Acheson Colloids Electrodag 188 was applied to the surface. The paint was omitted on small areas of the slab to facilitate potential measurements.Figures 3 and 4 provide a plan view of the surface of the slab showing top reinforcing steel locations, the rate of corrosion probe location, anode locations, and the locations of the unpainted spots used for potential measurements. The potentials were measured using portable copper copper sulfate cells placed on the unpainted concrete. The cathodic protection CP system was activated using anode 1 only and a constant current of 35 mA 1.75 mA ft2 of concrete surface 9.9 mA ft2 of top mat rebar and 3.5 mA ft2 of total rebar . System voltage was 2.0 volts and the concrete temperature averaged 18.30C. Table C shows the electrical potentials of the top mat reinforcing steel before CP activation, the Instant off potentials 30 minutes after activation, and the differences in potential due to OP. These data show conclusively that the steel can be polarized using this cathodic protection system. Throwing power of a single slot anode is at least 3 feet the maximum length tested . The cathodic protection system on this slab was operated at various currents and voltages for five months. A total of about 75 amperehours of current was passed without degradation of the conductive polymer concrete. Bond of the conductive polymer concrete to the portland cement concrete is excellent. Additionally, no large driving voltage increases have occurred during constant current tests, thus indicating that primary anode gas blockage is not a problem, even during a 2 day high current test when 300 mA was applied, and all top mat rcinforcing steel was polarized to instant off potential more negative than 1.01 volts saturated Calomel Standard Electrode CSE . The rate of corrosion probe in the slab has indicated a zero corrosion rate.

Cathodic protection was applied to another 20 ft2 slab using the conductive polymer concrete. Slab construction, reinforcement, slot size, primary anode material and locations, and previous exposure history were the same for this slab as for that described previously. A layer of resin only was painted on the slot surfaces to guarantee good contact of the polymer concrete with the existing concrete, the anode wires were placed in the slots, and the slots were filled with Mix 2 from Table A. To prevent resin bleeding to the surface from creating a high resistivity layer, additional DW2 coke was sprinkled on the surface to excess while the concrete was curing. The following day, the slab surface was sandblasted and a 4 layer built up polymer concrete overlay was placed. In the built up system, a layer of resin with additives is spread on the surface, aggregate is broadcast onto the resin and then the material is rolled. After this material has cured, the excess aggregate is removed and a second layer is applied in an identical manner. The first two layers of this overlay were made conductive through the use of Loresco DW2 coke as the sole aggregate. An angular quartz aggregate was used for the final two nonconductive layers. Testing prior to the application of CP indicated that the overlay was indeed conductive. For example, the 1000 cycle AC resistance between the two metal anode wires was 2380 ohms when the slots were simply filled with dry DW2 coke. After filling the slots with conductive polymer concrete and placing the built up overlay, the anode to anode resistance was 10.2 ohms. The CP system was activated using anode 2 only and currcnts varying from 17 to 25mA. Two days later the current was increased to 30mA and the CP rectifier was set to constant current for 25 days. At that time, control at a constant voltage of 3.0 volts was initiated. Currant output typically varied between 30 and 40mA depending primarily upon concrete temperature. Testing has repeatedly indicated that this CP system is functioning quite well.For example, the following data were obtained during depolarization tests system current prior to shutdown was 351no 1.9 mA ft2 of concrete surface 10.7 mA ft of top mat rebar and 3.8mA ft2 of total rebar Electrical Potential, mV CSESurface Distance from 12 30 12 30 13 31 Difference,Half Cell Anode 2, inches ON Instant 24 hr off DepolarizedPosition Off Depolar minus ized Instant off, off, mV 1 3 1300 880 352 528 2 24 1440 940 381 559 3 48 1090 810 438 372NOTE Potential measurements were made on the original concrete surface through holes drilled in the overlay. Neither the half cell nor the wetting solution was in contact with the conductive overlay.Trial on a bridge deck section The conductive polymer concrete cathodic protection system was installed on a 113 ft2 section of bridge deck which had been extracted from a 22 year old bridge deck that was being removed because of corrosion induced concrete damage. The slab was transported to Fairbank HighwayResearch Station and placed on 3 foot high posts. All exposed rebars on the slab edges were wired together to insure continuity and the edges were coated with 2 layers of epoxy paint. Cathodic protection instrumentation reference cells, rate of corrosion probes and thermocouples was then installed at the level of the top mat of reinforcing steel. The reference cells for this slab were silver silver chloride rather than the copper copper sulfate cells used previously. Three primary anode wires were installed in slots in the slab surface using the pourable conductive concrete of mix 2 of Table A and the 4 layer built up polyester polymer concrete overlay was placed over the entire slab. Figure 5 is a plan view of the slab with the position of all top mat reinforcing steel, anode lines and CP instrumentation shown.Installation procedures were identical to those used on the previous slab with the single exception that the original deck surface was scarified and sandblasted prior to overlay placement. Table D summarizes the electrical resistance data taken before, during and after system installation.Obviously, a very conductive slot fill and ovcrlay resulted. For example, the 1000 cycle AC resistance between anode 1 and anode 3 15 feet apart prior to overlay placement was 822 ohms, whereas this resistance the day after placement was 7.07 ohms. The cathodic protection system was activated the following day.Static before CP electrical potentials indicated by the 4 silver silver chloride reference cells are given below Ce 1 0.392 V Cell 2 0.382 V Cell 3 0.375 V Cell 4 0.404 VThe system rectifier was TASC V automatic instant OFF potential controlled SCR rectifier. Only anode line 1 on one edge of the slab was activated and system control was obtained by presetting the desired reference cell 4 set potential at 0.78V equivalent to 0.85V CSE . Cell 4 we. used because it is the embedded cell positioned the greatest distance from anode 1 12 feet . The system was then activated and within 3 minutes the desired set point was achieved. With the system operation at 4.0 volts and 0.35 amps the following instant OFF reference cell potential were recorded Cell 1 2 ft. from anode 1 0.881V Cell 2 4 ft. from anode 1 0.894V Cell 3 8 ft. from anode 1 0.749V Cell 4 12 ft. from anode 1 0.786V.

After this test proved successful, anode 2 was deactivated and anode 3 on the opposite end of the slab from anode 1 was activated system control was transferred to reference cell 3, set at 0.78V silver.

The system remained under the above mode of operation for a week, after which it was turned off for the purpose of charting depolarization. System current varied between 0.18A and 0.35A to maintain set point. This is equivalent to current densities of 1.6 to 3.1 mA ft2 of concrete surface, 2.0 to 3.8 mA ft2 of total rebar and 4.8 to 9.4 mA ft2 of top mat rebar. Figure 6 shows the depolarization characteristics detected by the embedded reference cells. Again, these data indicate excellent cathodic protection. In sum mary, the large scale bridge deck trial confirms that the subject conductive polymer concretes can be utilized to provide coefficient impressed current cathodic protection. The date indicate that primary anode spacing of at least 26 feet will be possible. Also, chain drag testing after overlay placement and a month later indicate it was properly bonded to the original deck surface. c Non overlay CP system, i.e. cathodic protection system. Cathodic protection can be achieved without the use of a conductive overlay or coating of the anodes are spaced closely together.Another 4 feet by 5 feet by 8.5 inch slab, like those shown in Figures 3 and 4, was used to confirm this system. The cathodic protection system is contained in slots placed in the concrete surface. Figure 7 shows the locations of the 3 8 inch slots and the locations of the potential measurements. To minimize costs a platinum clad wire was used as the transverse anode and carbon strands 2 Thornel 300, WYP 6 V0 strands manufactured by Union Carbide Corporation, Danbury, Connecticut were used as the longitudinal anodes. The vinyl ester conductive polymer concrete was then poured into the slots and silica sand was sprinkled on its surface to complete the CP system.To color match the conductive polymer concrete with the existing portland cement concrete, 0.7 percent titanium dioxide was blended with the calcined fluid petroleum coke this produced a gray color in the polymer concrete. Alternatively, the titanium dioxide could have been added to the resin . It should be noted that the titanium dioxide increases the resistivity of the polymer concrete the last 2 items ofTable B give an indication of the magnitude of the increase. The following polarization data confirm that cathodic protection of the top mat reinforcing steel has been achieved.

It involves the placement of a cathodic protection system similar to that described in item c on the existing surface rather than in slots and then overlaying that with conventional portland cement concrete or other paving material. Alternatively, the system could have been placed in slots just as in item c and then the overlay placed on top. Two slabs similar to the previous ones were used to determine the viability of this system. A grid of conductive polymer concrete lines was placed on the surfaces of the slabs at the same locations as the slots shown in Figure 7. The transverse line contained a platinized wire while the 5 crossing lines were composed of only conductive polymer concrete. The polymer concrete for one slab was polyester resin while that for the other slab was vinyl ester resin. Several days after placement of the polymer concretes, the slab with the polyester resin CP system was overlaid with 1.5 inches of latex modified portland cement concrete and the slab with the vinyl ester resin CP system was overlaid with 1.5 inches of conventional portland cement concrete. The following polarization data confirm that CP systems on bbth of these slabs are functioning properly no delamination or other failures of the overlays has occurred.

Although the present invention has been described with respect to a cathodic protection system for reinforcing steel, it is obvious that calcined fluid petroleum coke can be used as the particulate matter in any of theCNPapplications shown by the prior art wherein a normally nonconductive polymer is made conductive by the addition of particulate matter to the polymer. In the following claims the words resin is intended to mean the resin itself plus all standard additives such as catalyst, coupling agent, wetting agent, etc.
