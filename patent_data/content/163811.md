## Description
The present invention relates to a system for dialysis, particularly for peritoneal dialysis, which allows the elimination of contaminations of the r.ee die and of the dialytic liquid, simplifies and makes easier all the operations to be carried out by the patients, is more acceptable to said patients also under the psychological profile and allows its use also to heavy handicapcarrying patients, such as f.i. the blinds. In prior patents, particularly in the U.S. Patent No. 4,306,976 Applicant has described a method and a device for carrying out continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis CAP , in which two bags are employed, one bag containing fresh dialytic liquid, and the other bag being empty and destined to the collection of the drained liquid.Both the tube feeding the liquid from the filled bag and the tube of input to the empty bag are connected, at one of their ends, to a first y shaped junction from which starts a third tube that is provided at its remote end with a sterile needle to be inserted into a second y junction having, within each one of its branches, two membranes forming a chamber containing a sterilizing or antiseptic liquid.The common output channel of this second junction is connected to the peritoneal catheter.To operate a device of the above type it is necessary 1 to take away the protecting cap from the needle with consequent risks of contact contamination and of possible psychological discomfort of the pa tient at the sight of the needle 2 exert a certain pressure to insert said needle, in one of the antiseptic liquid containing chambers, by perforating the two membranes, with diffi cults in correctly positioning the needle, especially when old and or han dicaped persons fi. blinds have to actuate said perforation.This system has obtained a large success based on its decisive advantages over the conventional methods of peritoneal dialysis using only one bag.By continuing the research in this field Applicant has succeeded in imparting further improvements to said double bag system and device. Indeed one of the objects of the present invention is to provide a system for the double bag peritonal dialysis, from which all risks of contamination of the needle and of the dialytic liquid are eliminated.An other object of the invention is to provide a system of the above mentioned kind, in which the perforating needle is guided to a fixed point of the mem brane within the y junction branches, allowing thus a much easier perforation and a longer life of the membranes and, therefore, of the relevant y junctions.A f object of the invention is to ptwide a system which besides being exempt of needle contamination risks and s high perforation facility and long life of the membrane within the y junction, is moreover particular ly acceptable to the patients under the psychological point of view. Those and other objects are reached with the system according to the invention which is substantially characterized in that to the dialytic liquid adducting needle are associated means of sterile protection and ii far mechanical coupling and to each one of the two branches of the y junction containing the relevant disinfection chamber delimited by the two membranes, are associated remo vable covering earns, means to guide the needle towards a substantially fixed zone of the membrane and means of mechanical engagement which are complementary to said mechanical coupling means associated to the dialytic liquid adducting needle.According to a first feature of the invention, said means for the sterile protective covering of the needle show a portion having an inner diameter slightly higher than the needle outer diameter a longitudinal extension slightly lower or egual to the needle length flexibility and elasticity characteristics which consent a behaviour like that of extensible and retractable bellows and has one end incorporated with said coupling means.According to an advantageus feature of the invention said extensible and retractable bellows hyde to the patient sight the whole needle when the complementary means on the y junction are not engaged, respectively hyde the needle portion remaining outside said junction when same means are engaged.The guide and covering means of the free ends of each branch of the y junction, consist of an annular portion restricting the inner diameter of said ends and wings extending outwards to engage said covering means of each branch of the y shaped junction in rest conditions, respectively the threaded retrac table cap associated to the needle ends in operative conditions.The various features and advantages of the invention will better appear from the description of the preferred, not limiting embodiment shown in the attached drawing in which Fig. 1 is a schematic partial front view of the whole dialysis apparatus incorporating the device according to the invention generally indicated with reference A in not operative conditions Fig. 1 is a schematic partially cross sectioned view on enlarged scale of the right hand portion of A, in not operative conditions Fig. 2 is a schematic partial cross section of the device according to the invention, on a slightly aged scale and in operative conditions Fig. 3 is a perspective view of the surface guiding the needle into the di sinfection chamber and Fig. 4 is a block scheme illustrating the operative steps in using the de vice according to the invention. Referring to figure 1 there are indicated with SP the bag filled with the fresh dialytic fluid LS SP the i bag destined to receive the dialytic fluid eShaoEted at the end of the peritoneal dialysis and T1 and T2 the small tubes of adduction of the fresh fluid from SP, respectively of return of the isted liquid LE to the initially empty bag SV. To each tube is associated a defluxion or flow control valve f.i. closing keys or claps M1 resp. M2. Ibe ends of T1 and T2 remote from the ends connected to the bags are intro duped in two branches of a first y shaped junction from which outgoes a com mon tube T3 at the free end of which is associated a first element EA T3 within the rectangular dotted lire at left hand to be connected to a second element BA YC within the rectangular dotted line at right hand of a y shapecJunction whcee branch in common goes in a small tube T4 of the catheter C already inserted into the patient peritoneum PE. According to the invention the first element EA T3 shows a rigid piece PR which the the end 10 firmly secured to the end T 3 of tube T3 and the other end 11 rigidly fixed to the needle AGO. In other words the rigid element PR works as needle carrier and as as rigid connection of tube T3 to the needle end forced in said piece PR. According to the feature of the invention the needle mayor portion 12 abutting from 11 is covered by a sterile retractable sheath GU which extends substantially over the needle total length.Said sheath is fixed, on one side, to a protuberance 15 of element PR and, on the other side, to a projection 16 of a cap CU which is characteristically located at the needle free terminal portion, and projects slightly outside said portion.Said cap CU is innerly threaded and is integral with the protuberance 16 having ar, inner diameter slightly higher than the needle outer diameter.The other element EA YC comprises two branches 18 and 19 of the second yshaped junction Y2.Each element 18 and 19 contains two membranes 20 21 respectively 20 21 which form the disirfection chambers filled of a sterilizing liquid.According to the invention, the input of each branch 18, 19 consists of a thin anular member 30 having a structure suitable to guide the needle into its inner free hollow surface 31 which is in front of a pre determaned zone preferably provided with an indentation area I formed in each membrane 20 respectively 20 Fig. 1 .In not operative conditions the top of each branch 18, 19 of the second yjunction Y2 is protected by a removable cover CO which is screwdon the head of 18 resp. 19 by means of two small radial tongues 40 and 41 projecting outwardly from the outer surface of said elements 18, 19. Said rest position corresponding the inoperative conditions of the device of the invention, is shown ir, Fig. 1 and is characterized in that needle AGO is entirely covered by sheath GU, the inwardly projecting exten sion 16 of CU covers substantially the needle point and the cap CU projects outwardly said needle point.According to an advantageous feature of the invention, in rest conditions the patient who has to set about his using this dialysis device does practically not see said needle covered by the sterile sheath GU and therefore does not undergo psychological discomfort on the side EA YC associated to the catheter the two branches 18 and 19 including the disinfection chambers are normally closed by a cover or cap CO, rep. X screwd on the tclngtres 40 and 41.go now over to the true operative phase see also Fig. 1 and the block diagramm n of Rig. 4 the patient carries out followirg steps I Takes the protective cover 00 or CO away from the top of one of the two branches 18 or 19 of the second y junction Y2 associated to the ca theter C. H Disinfects the upper portion of the head of f.i. cap 18 previously freed of cover CO .III Screws CU projecting on the expension 40 and 41 of 18 with no cover CO , said cap CU being located at the nermally free end of the needle ACO and projecting outwarlly from same end. IV By exerting a force on the rigid body PR, pushes the needle point towards membrane 20, same needle point being now guided by the inner anular por tion 3Q of 18 toward a sase zone preferably provided with the indenta tion area I of membrane 20.V The needle AGO is thus kept in operative position held fast in particu lar by the bole that same needle point has made in the membranes 20 and 21 and also by the central hole IM of the guiding anular portion 30 Fig. 3 . After a few minutes the needle portion penetrated in the disinfection chamber defined by the the membranes 2U and 21 and filled of antiseptic liquid, is innerly flown by the fresh dialytic liquid coming from the filled bag SP, after that the patient has opened clamp M1.The above men tioned operations and their succession are indicated in the block diagram of Fig. 4, under the reference 1 ASP CO removal of cap CO 2 DIS, disinfection of the top of the head of branch 18 from which cover CO has been removed 3 Cm 18 screwing of cap CU on branch 18 4 SPI, pu shing the needle point toward membrane 20 and guiding same by means of the anular inner portion 30 of 18 towards the zone provided with inden tation area I of membrane 20.At the end of the dialysis the patient will close clamp M1 and will open M2 allowing thus the exhausted fluid to flow into the initially empty bag SV.Advantageously either during the permanence phase of the dialytic fluid within the peritoneum, or during the exhausted liquid extraction the patient has the possibility of closing also M2, exerting a minimum force on the rigid piece PR to extract the needle projecting portion from the membranes 20, 21, unscrewing the cap CU from protuberances 40, 41 on 18 or 19 and screwing the cover CO or CO on same tongues or wings 40, 41 whereby the device is brought back to the initial inoperative condition. The sheath GU extending between the end of the pushing rigid piece PR and the re entrant end 16 of cap CU has plastomeric or elastomeric characteristics to retract as bellows SOP Fig. 2 when the patient pushes PR to cause the penetration of the needle into the membranes 20 and 21. Said sheath GU is advantageously a simple tube made of thermoplastic material with or without plasticizers and or with elastomeric characteristics whereby it exerts pratically no resistance when it passes from its entirely extended state of Fig. 1 to its shortened and retracted bellows like state of Fig. 2. Among the advantages of the invention we limit ourself to mention some of the very important ones such as 1 Thanks to the sterile retractable sheath GU, contamination of the needle ard thus of the input dialytic liquid is by no means possible, ever. in correspondence of wrong inanoeuvrvrg of the device by the patient.2 The use of the needle is now simplified because the zone to perforate is pre determined in corrispondence of indentation area I and there is no more need to tentatively search it as in the conventional system.3 The perforation is easy as the needle is guided, perpendicularly to the rubber rubber surface to be perforated.4 The perforation is even easier as it takes place always in a same point. 5 Longer life of the second y junction because of the perforations in a sa me zone.6 Better psychological acceptance by the patient of this hydden needle sy stes as the needle is covered by Gri. 7 Possisity of use of such a system also by handicaped patient, f.i. blinds occurring rather frequently in this therapy type .Even if the invention has been described, for clarity sake, with reference to its simplest embodiment shown in the accompanying drawing, it is suscep tible of changes, inventions and the like that being obvious to the skilled persons, are to be considered as naturally comprised within the scope and spirit of the invention.
