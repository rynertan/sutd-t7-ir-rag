# Method and apparatus for space dyeing yarn.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for the space dyeing of yarn while the yarn is in the form of a loosely gathered package, such as a conventional yarn skein 32 , and which includes injecting an atomized spray of dye and air at a plurality of spaced apart locations in the package, and such that the dye contacts only a portion of the yarn. The resulting yarn is characterized by essentially random and relatively short col orband lengths, which avoid the formation of unsightly streaks of chevrons on the face of a fabric formed from the yarn.
