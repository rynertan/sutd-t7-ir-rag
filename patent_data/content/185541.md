# A screw conveyor.

## Abstract
A screw conveyor having a propelling device arranged to push a plastic material into a screw 2 . The propelling device comprises a roller 5 , a rectangular vane 7 slidable in a slot in the roller, and a guide member 10 , which are disposed above the screw and adjacent a wall 14 of the housing of the screw conveyor. The roller rotates about its axis while its circumferential surface is in contact with an arcuate face of the guide member, so that one edge of the vane is caused to protrude from the roller pheriphery to push the plastic material into the screw, thereby effecting feeding of the plastic material.
