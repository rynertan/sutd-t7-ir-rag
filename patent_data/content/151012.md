# ALL WEATHER SWITCH FOR RAILROADS

## Abstract
An improved railroad stub switch is described in which the axial rail tension or compression forces due to tem perature fluctuations are transmitted through the switch by means of radius arms connected to both the switch and fixed rails, thereby eliminating the need for expensive expansion joints at the switch. In a preferred embodiment, interlocking point shoes are also employed so as to hold the butt ends in vertical and horizontal register and transmit a signal to the trailing side rail of the impending approach of a load from the approach side rail, thereby reducing batter on the trailing side rail.
