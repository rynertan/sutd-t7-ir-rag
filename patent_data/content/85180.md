# Miniaturized antenna duplexer using saw filter.

## Abstract
The antenna duplexer comprises a first surface acoustic wave SAW filter 21 for local oscillation frequency, a second filter 22 for reception frequency which is coupled with said local filter 21 and has the coupled side thereof partly constituted by a second SAW filter 5 , a third filter 3 for transmission frequency coupled with said second filter 22 , and an antenna 11 coupled between said second and third filter 22 and 3, resp. . This antenna duplexer with a SAW filter 8 is very compact and shows satisfactory electrical characteristics without requiring any additional circuits.
