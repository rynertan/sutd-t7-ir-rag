# An electrode section.

## Abstract
The proper assembly of electrode sections having screw thread socket 12 and projection 10,42 connections is facilitated by placing orientation index marks 26 on the electrode ends 14 , which marks are lined up at the time of the assembly and before a projection of one electrode section 24 is screwed into the socket of another electrode section 36 . Placing of the marks is done with marking gauges and the location is predetermined with reference to the pitch of the socket threads.
