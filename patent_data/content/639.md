# Method of producing a uniaxially oriented polymer material.

## Abstract
In a method of producing uniaxially oriented polymer material, particularly a uniaxially oriented film, from a high density polyethylene, in which the material is put under tension and is drawn from a transverse heated portion with a draw ratio of 5 1 or higher preferably 7 1 to 20 1 the drawing temperature is selected to be between 80 C and 110 C, and preferably below 105 C, whereby excellent gas barrier characteristics are obtained in the drawn material.
