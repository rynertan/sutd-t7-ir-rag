# Clutch driven plate assembly with multi part hub.

## Abstract
A clutch driven plate assembly 10 for use in an automotive vehicle having a multi part hub assembly 11 with the capability of trapping lubricant in the gear teeth when the assembly is subjected to centrifugal force in operation. The hub assembly includes an inner hub 34 in axial splined engagement with the transmission input shaft 12 , an outer hub 41 with an integral radial flange 49 and in splined engagement with the inner hub through helical splines 37,43 . The inner hub is formed of a light weight non metallic material, or the outer hub houses an annular spacer formed of an impact and sound absorbing material to cushion the inner hub upon reciprocation thereof within the outer hub, the outer hub having end plates which act as a dam for lubricant within the intermeshing helical gear teeth.
