# Friction open end spinning apparatus and method of cleaning same.

## Abstract
The yarn formation area of a friction spinning apparatus, in which the rotating friction rollers 1, 2 and the feed duct 8 lie closely adjacent, is quickly and simply cleaned of remaining fibres at a yarn break and protection is provided against damage caused by excess fibres entering the area. One of the rollers 1 , which is imperforate, is mounted for pivotal movement away from the area and at a break suction through the other roller 2 is temporarily closed off from one end of the area toward the opposite end to eject the remaining fibres. Return movement of the roller 1 is guided to ensure proper return of the operating position.
