# COATING COMPOSITION AND METHOD FOR PARTIALLY SOLDERING A SUBSTRATE

## Abstract
The invention concerns a coating composition which may be used to form a peelable solder mask. The coating composi tion comprises a mixture of vinylic resin, microcrystalline wax and solvent. Applied as a film coating, the coating composition can be used to provide a temporary mask to selected areas of a substrate, for example, a printed circuit, prior to exposure to a solder flux, the mask being readily peelable from the sub strate.
