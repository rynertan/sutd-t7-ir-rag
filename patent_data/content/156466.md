# Compact crank drive mechanism.

## Abstract
A crankdrive mechanism for a two piston 1,5 Stirling engine which greatly reduces engine size and weight without increasing complexity or decreasing mechanical efficiency. A single throw crankshaft 20 is located between two cyl inders and within the reciprocation limits of at least one of the pistons. An inverted triangular yoke 3 connects a single crankpin 12 with the two piston connecting rods 2,6 which are in turn connected with the respective pistons 1,5 . A rocking lever 8 connects the yoke 3 with the engine hous ing and absorbs any side loads associated with the crankdrive mechanism. Extensive clearance provided between the cyl inders and in the pistons 1,5 permits the engine parts to be arranged in a very compact manner with ample running clearance.
