## Description
Particles containing an iron carbide, production process and use thereof The invention relates to particles containing an iron carbide, a process for their production and their use. At present, acicular iron oxide is widely used as a magnetic recording material. However, Y iron oxide having an average axial ratio of at least 1.0 and less than 3.0 is low in the magnetic characteristics such as coercive force, etc. and is not used presently as the magnetic recording material. Despite the above, the iron oxide or starting material thereof such as other iron oxides or iron oxyhydroxides are easily prepared and particles obtained therefrom are expected to have a high compact density when coated. Further, iron carbide in the form of spherical particles is known to be a magnetic material U. S.Patent No. 3,572,993 . This iron carbide is, however, prepared by heating iron carbonyl in CO or a mixture of CO and H2. The method is dangerous, complicated and is conducted with an extreme difficulty. Moreover, particles produced have a very small average particle size of 0.005 to O, 1 CI m, easily agglomerate and are hardly dispersible. Thus, the particles are difficult to be handled and are not manufactured presently. An object of the invention is to provide a particle having a relatively high coercive force and easily handled due to a relatively large average particle size obtained from an easily available starting iron compound, and a magnetic arterial containing the above particle. The above and other objects of the invention will become apparent from the following description. The invention provides particles containing an iron carbide having an . average axial ratio of at least 1.0 and less than 3.0, and an average particle size ofMore than 0.1cm and up to 5 Pm. The present particles can be produced by a contacting or not contacting acicular oxyhydroxide or acicular iron oxide with a reducing agent containing no carbon atom, the iron compound having an average axial ratio of at least 1.0 and less than 3.0, and an average particle size of more than O.lPm and up to 5 Pm mand, b contacting the iron compound of the above a with a reducing and carbonizing agent containing carbon atom or a mixture thereof with a reducing agent containing no carbon atom. Examples of preferred iron oxyhydroxides are a FeOOH goethite , ss Fe O O H akaganite and 7 F e O O H lepidocrosite . Examples of preferred iron oxides are a Fe203 hematite , r Fe203 maghemite and Fe3O4 magnetite . alpha Fe203 or r Fe2O 3 is, for example, any of one prepared by heating alpha FeO O H, fl FeOOH or 7 FeOOH at about 200 to about 350 C followed by dehydration, a F e2 0 3 or alpha Fe203 prepared by heating the resulting product further at about 350 to about 900 C to compact the crystals, and others. fl FeOOH is preferably treated with an aqueous solution of alkaline compound Japanese patent application No. 10400 1984 . The above mentioned F e 3 4 can be prepared by contacting an iron oxide other than Fe304 or iron oxyhydroxide with a reducing and carbonizing agent containing carbon atom or a reducing agent containing no carbon atom, or a mixture thereof, although the Fe304 is not limited to one prepared in those methods. When a reducing and carbonizing agent containing carbon atom or a mixture thereof with a reducing agent containing no carbon atom, is contacted with an iron oxyhydroxide or iron oxide other than Fe304 to prepare Fe O4, the same contact conditions as those in the process of the invention can also be employed except for the time condition.In this case, the Fe304 formed can be subsequently held in contact with the gas under the same conditions as in the preceding reaction without any interruption to obtain the desired particulate material of the invention. The starting iron oxyhydroxides or iron oxides can be those at least 1.0 and less than 3.0, in average axial ratio and having an average particle size long axis of more than 0.1 Pin and up to 5 Pm. As will be described later, the particles produced are slightly smaller than, but almost unchanged from, the starting material in average axial ratio and in average particle size, so that the particles of the invention in general preferably have such sizes as already stated. The starting material to be used for the process for producing particles according to the invention may have added thereto a small amount or small amounts of a compound, such as oxide or carbonate of copper, magnesium, manganese or nickel, silicon oxide, potassium salt, sodium salt, etc., insofar as the starting material chiefly comprises an iron oxyhydroxide or iron oxide. The starting iron oxyhydroxide preferably has a pH of at least 5 on the surface thereof as disclosed in Japanese patent application No. 217,530 1983. In this case are produced particles having a higher coercive force.The starting iron oxyhydroxide having a pH of less than 5 can be used after it is increased to at least 5 in pH by contact with an aqueous solution of an alkali compound eg, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide . Further, alkali treated iron oxide can a also be used. The starting material can be treated with an alkaline compound by contacting the material with an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide. ammonium hydroxide and like alkaline compound eg, with an aqueous solution having a pH of at least 8, preferably at least 10 , stirring for 30 minutes to 1 hour when required, filtering and drying the mixture. I ron oxyhydroxide or iron oxide can be coated with a cobalt compound, for example, by dispersing the iron compound in an aqueous solution of a cobalt salt es, dilute solution of 0.1 to 10 by weight with stirring at room temperature or with heating, render the dispersion to alkaline with addition of an aqueous solution of an alkaline compound, stirring for 30 minutes to 1 hour when required, filtering and drying the dispersion. The starting iron compound can be used as coated with a sintering preventing agent as disclosed in Japanese patent application No. 250,163 1983. Examples of useful agents are silicone compound, boron compound, aluminum compound, aliphatic carboxylic acid or salt thereof, phosphorus compound, titanium compound, etc. In the invention, typical examples of the reducing agent containing no carbon atom are H2,NH2NH2, etc. As the reducing and carbonizing agent, at least one of the following compounds can be used. O CO al aliphatic linear or cyclic, saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbons such as methane, propane, butane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, acetylene, ethylene, propylene, butadiene, isoprene, town gas, etc. Gh aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene, alkylated or alkenylated derivatives thereof having a boiling point up to 150 C. g aliphatic alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, cyclohexanol, etc. esters such as methyl formate, ethyl acetate and like ester having a boiling point up to 150C ethers such as lower alkyl ether, vinyl ether and like ether having a boiling point up to 150C 7 aldehydes such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and like aldehyde having a boiling point up to 150C ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone and like ketone having a boiling point up to 150 C Particularly preferable reducing and carbonizing agent containing carbon atom are CO, CH30H, HCOOCH3, saturated or unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbons having 1 to 5 carbon atoms. In the process a of the invention, the reducing agent containing no carbon atom can be used as it is or as diluted. Examples of diluents are N2, argon, helium, etc. The dilution ratio is suitably selected but is preferably about 1.1 to about 10 times by volume . The contact temperature, contact time, gas flow rate and other conditions depend, for example, on the production history, average axial ratio, average particle size and specific surface area of the iron oxyhydroxide or iron oxide. The preferred contact temperature is about 200 to about 700 C, preferably about 300 to about 400 C. The preferred contact time is about 0.5 to about 6 hours.The preferred gas flow rate excluding diluent is about 1 to about 1000 ml S.T.P. min, more preferably about 5 to about 500 ml S.T.P. min, per gram of the starting material. The contact pressure inclusive of that of the diluent is usually 1 to 2 atom. although not limitative particularly. I n the process b of the invention, the reducing and carbonizing agent containing carbon atom or a mixture thereof with the reducing agent containing no carbon atom can be used as it is or as diluted. When the mixture is used, the mixing ratio of the reducing and carbonizing agent and the reducing agent is suitably selected but is preferably 1 0.05 to 1 5 by volume.Contact conditions are also suitably selected but the preferred contact temperature is about 250 to about 400 C, more preferably about 300 to about 400 C. The preferred contact time is about 0.5 to 6 hours when the contact in a is conducted, and about 1 to about 12 hours when the contact in a is not conducted. The preferred gas flow rate excluding diluent is about 1 to about 1000 xl S.T.P. min, more preferably about 5 to about 500 ml S.T. P. Imin, per gram of the starting iron compound.The contact pressure inclusive of that of the diluent is usually 1 to 2 atom. although not limitative particularly. The particulate material obtained by the present process are in the form of generally uniform particles when observed under an electron microscope. The particles are present as primary particles and have the same particulate form as the starting particles of iron oxyhydroxide or iron oxide. The particles obtained by the process are found to contain carbon by elementary analysis and to contain an iron carbide by its X ray diffraction pattern, which exhibits plane spacings at 2.28A, 2.20A, 2.08A, 2. 05A and 1.92A. Such pattern corresponds to Fe5C2. The iron carbide component of the present material chiefly comprises Fe5 C2, with Fe2C, Fe20C9 Fe2.2C , Fe3C, etc. present conjointly therewith in some cases.I t is suitable to represent the iron carbide as FexC 2 Sx 3 . I n the event of incomplete carbonization, the particles obtained by the present process further contain an iron oxide component which is chiefly Fe O4. With respect to iron oxides, FeO, Fe3O4 and z Fe203 are generally related to one another in structure. The oxygen atoms in these three oxides are packed in a three dimensional structure to the highest possible density, and the number of oxygen atoms in Fe3O4 actually present varies in an overall range covering the numbers of oxygen atoms in these oxides, so that it is suitable to represent the iron oxide in the particles by F e O y 1 yf1.5 . While the particles prepared by the present process contain iron oxide in addition to the iron carbide component in most cases, the elementary analysis values of C, H and N indicate that the amount of carbon is usually excess of that calculated from the chemical formula of the iron carbide identified by theX ray diffraction pattern. It is not clear whether the excess of carbon is present as combined with iron or as free carbon. In this sense, it is probable that the particles obtained by the present process contain elemental carbon. The particles obtained by the present process then include particles at least 1.0 and less than 3.0 in average axial ratio with respect to their shape as primary particles and composed substantially of iron carbide alone or iron carbide and iron oxide and or elemental carbon. The iron carbide and iron oxide contents of the particles obtained by the present process can be determined from the chemical formulae Fisc2 and Peso4, which are confirmed as the main iron carbide and iron oxide components by X ray diffraction analysis, the result of elementary analysis and the weight gain on ignition. The iron carbide content is preferably at least 20wt , more preferably at least 50wt . The iron oxide content is preferably up to 7Owt , more preferably up to 40wt . I n the invention, the iron carbide containsFe5C2 as a main component and contains preferably about 80 to 100 by weight of Fes C2. The particles obtained by the present process are slightly smaller than but almost the same as the starting particles, namely iron oxyhydroxide or iron oxide, in average axial ratio and average particle size.Accordingly the particles prepared by the present process have an average axial ratio of at least 1.0 and less than 3.0, and an average particle size long axis of more than 0.1flu Pm and up to 5 Pm The particles of the present invention containing iron carbide are useful as a magnetic material for magnetic recording as is apparent from the foregoing characteristics, etc., while the use thereof is not limited thereto. For example, the particulate material is usable as a catalyst for preparing lower aliphatic hydrocarbons from CO and H2. In the present invention, it is possible to produce a particle having a relatively high coercive force from an easily available starting iron compound. The invention will be described below in detail with reference to examples. I n the following examples, characteristics, etc.are determined in the methods described below. 1 Magnetic characteristics. Determined in the following method unless otherwise specified. Coercive force Hc, saturation magnetization as, e.m.u. and remanent magnetization ar, e.m.u. are measured in a magnetic field with a strength of 5 kOe, using a gauss meter equipped with a Hall effect element and the sample with a packing ratio of 0.2. 2 Elementary analysis for C, H and N The sample is subjected to elementary analysis in the conventional method using MT2 C H N CORDER Yanaco, product of Yanagimoto Mfg. Co., Ltd, with passage of oxygen helium carrier at 900 C. 3 Determination of composition The composition of the product is calculated from the chemical formulae of iron oxide and iron carbide determined by X ray diffractiometry, the elementary analysis value of C and the weight gain resulting from the following heat treatment. The calculation is conducted on the basis that Fe304, for example, changes into Fe203 having 1.035 times the weight of the former oxide and that Fe5C2 changes into Fe203 having 1.317 times the weight of the carbide. The weight gain is determined in the conventional method of heat treatment, i.e. by placing the sample in a platinum crucible, then heating the sample in a muffle furnace at 600 C for 1 hour in the air and measuring the resulting weight gain after ascertaining the presence of a Fe2O3 by X ray diffraction. Stated more specifically, it is assumed that the proportions of Fe5C2, Fe304 and elemental carbon are x, y and z wt , respectively, and that the carbon analysis value and the weight gain are A and B wt , respectively. The values x, y and z are then given by the following equations. x y z 100 1.317x 1.035y 100 B z 0.079x A Example 1 Two grams of goethite particles, 0.6 Pm in.average size long axis and 2 in average axial ratio, were placed into a porcelain boat, which was then inserted into a tubular furnace. After replacing the air in the furnace by nitrogen, the particles were heated to 300C and kept at this temperature for 2 hours while passing H2 through the furnace at a flow rate of 100 ml min. The particles were kept at this temperature for 1 hour while passing CO through the furnace at a flow rate of 100 mI min. The particles were thereafter allowed to cool to room temperature to obtain a black powder. The X ray diffraction pattern of the product matched that of Fe5C2 Iron Carbide on ASTM X Ray Powder Data File 20 509. The results were given inTables 1 and 2.
