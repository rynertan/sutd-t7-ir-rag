## Description
Anthelmintic preparations The present invention relates to anthelmintic preparations, particularly for the treatment of ruminants. As clinical and sub clinical nematode infections can cause serious economic loss, due to death, reduced weight gain and lowered milk yield, anthelmintic treatment of ruminants is now a routine practice. Treatment is also undertaken to reduce pasture larval contamination and thus aids in ensuring optimal grassland usage. In some cases, however, even after anthelmintic treatment, animals still fail to thrive. It is now considered that this may be caused by mineral deficiencies resulting from soils and pastures deficient in minerals.Cobalt is one mineral that may be lacking in the diet of ruminants, particularly in the spring, when there is pasture dominance of rapidly growing grasses, which have a lower cobalt content than more slowly growing grasses.Cobalt participates in the production of vitamin B12 in the rumen, and deficiency results in loss of appetite and loss of bodyweight, and the animal may finally waste away.In the ewe, in addition to weight loss, milk yield falls and there is a reduction in fleece quality. Selenium is also an essential element, but its exact metabolic function is uncertain. Deficiency is associated with muscular dystrophy, unthriftiness and infertility in female animals. It has, therefore, been proposed to administer trace elements, particularly cobalt and selenium, to animals.Some of the trace elements, however, are toxic, and it is possible to overdose animals. This is particularly so with selenium, the oral LD50 of which is only 0.5 mg kg. The present invention is based on the surprising observation that a preparation comprising both selenium and an anthelmintic agent has a very greatly increased safety margin with regard to the selenium. Accordingly, the present invention provides a veterinary preparation which comprises an anthelmintic agent and a selenium salt, preferably in admixture or conjunction with a carrier suitable for use in a veterinary preparation. Preferably, the preparation also comprises a cobalt salt. The anthelmintic agent may be suitable for treating worms and or flukes, and is preferably a benzimidazole anthelmintic, for example, parbendazole, oxfendazole, oxibendazole, thiabendazole, albendazole, cambendazole, mebendazole, flubendazole or fenbendazole. As a general rule, the less soluble a benzimidazole anthelmintic, the more active it is. Accordingly, fenbendazole, oxfendazole and albendazole are more active than thiabendazole, parbendazole and cambendazole and are, therefore, preferred. Fenbendazole is a broad spectrum anthelmintic with excellent efficacy against adult, larval and egg stages of all important gastro intestinal and respiratory nematodes of ruminants. In addition, it is effective against both scolices and segments of M. expansa, the cestode affecting sheep and cattle. It is non teratogenic, and so can be used safely in animals at any stage of pregnancy. Having no adverse effect on fertility, it can be used around the time of service and in the breeding male. It has a very high safety margin sheep 1000 times the recommended dose, cattle 50 times the recommended dose . Moreover, it is non toxic to handlers. Oxfendazole and albendazole have substantially the same spectrum of activity as fenbendazole, but have a lower therapeutic index. Fenbendazole methyl 5phenylthio 2 benzimidazole carbamate is particularly preferred as the anthelmintic agent for the preparation of the present invention. A preparation of the invention may be in liquid or solid form. A liquid preparation may be a solution, but is generally a suspension, preferably a fairly mobile suspension. Other forms of preparation suitable for dosing animals may be used, for example, tablets, bolus tablets and pastes and powders and granules for reconstitution as solutions or suspensions prior to use.Moreover, animals may be dosed by the addition of an anthelmintic agent, a selenium salt and, preferably also a cobalt salt, directly to the feed. A preparation of the invention, accordingly, may be in a form suitable for addition to an animal feedstuff. The invention further comprises an animal feedstuff that has been augmented by the incorporation of an anthelmintic agent, a selenium salt and, preferably, also a cobalt salt. In a preparation of the invention, the selenium salt may be insoluble or soluble, soluble salts being preferred, for example, alkali metal and ammonium salts. The selenium may be in the form of a selenate, selenite or selenide.Examples of selenium salts are sodium, potassium and ammonium selenate, sodium, potassium and ammonium selenite, and sodium and potassium selenide. Selenates are generally preferred as they are the most soluble, and sodium selenate is particularly preferred. The cobalt salt also may be insoluble or soluble, examples of cobalt salts being cobalt carbonate, cobalt chloride, cobalt nitrate and cobalt sulphate. Cobaltous or cobaltic salts may be used Soluble cobalt salts are preferred. In a liquid preparation, the selenium salt and, when present, the cobalt salt, is preferably in solution to ensure a uniform distribution of these elements throughout the preparation and therefore to improve dose to dose reproducibility. One or more further physiologically active substance s may be present in a preparation of the invention, for example, selected from vitamins and, especially, other trace elements, for example, copper, zinc and magnesium. One or more carriers suitable for veterinary preparations may be present in addition to the active substances to aid manufacture and or to confer desirable properties on the final preparation. Such materials include pH adjusters, pH buffers, wetting agents, suspending agents, thickening agents, stabilising agents, solubiZisers, antimicrobial preservatives, lubricants and disintegration agents. Water is generally the basis for a solution or suspension. A suspension of the invention may be prepared by mixing the ingredients with water using a high speed mixer homogeniser until a uniform dispersion is achieved. The pH of the suspension is usually adjusted to the range 5.5 to 6.5 and especially to 5.9 to 6.0 to optimise product stability. The suspension preferably includes ingredients to ensure an elegant product by retarding sedimentation and or aiding resuspension on shaking, for example, a thixotropic agent, eg. colloidal silicon dioxide, and or a thickening agent, eg. carboxymethyl cellulose. The selenium salt is preferably added as a solution to avoid dust problems on handling. Other preparation forms, for example, tablets,powders and granules, may be prepared in a conventional manner. In a suspension of the invention the fenbendazole content is, for example, in the range of from 10 to 40 mg ml for sheep and goats,especially 25 mg ml. For cattle, the fenbendazole content is, for example, from 20 to 200 mg ml, especially 100 mg ml. If a different anthelmintic agent is used, the dose should be substantially equivalent to that given above for fenbendazole. The recommended doses of most anthelmintic agents for sheep,goats and cattle are generally well known. The content of selenium in a suspension of the invention, calculated as elemental selenium is, for example, within the range of from 0.1 to 2.0 mg ml, especially 0.4 mg ml for sheep and goats, and within the range of for from 0.1 to 2.5 mg ml, especially 2.0 mg ml for cattle. The cobalt content, also calculated as the elemental substance is, for example, from 0.1 to 5.0 mg mlF especially from 0.9 to 1.0 mg ml for sheep and goats, and from 0.1 to 5.0 mg ml,especially 2.5 mg ml for cattle. If desired, however, the selenium content can be increased considerably, for example, up to 10 mg ml, for sheep, goats and cattle. A suspension of the invention for sheep and goats preferably comprises 25 mg of fenbendazole, 0.4 mg of elemental selenium and 0.95 mg of cobalt per ml. With this preparation, the recommended dose is 1 ml 5 kg body weight. A suspension of the invention for cattle preferably comprises 100 mg of fenbendazole, 2.0 mg of elemental selenium and 2.5 mg of elemental cobalt per ml. The recommended dose of this preparation is 7.5 ml per 100 kg body weight. In a tablet or bolus tablet of the invention, the doeses of the various ingredients may be calculated pro rata from the doses given above, knowing the body weight of the intended recipient of the dose, for example, in a tablet suitable for administration to a 50 kg sheep, the fenbendazole content is generally from 100 to 400 mg, especially from 250 to 300 mg, the content of elemental selenium is generally from 1 to 20 mg, especially from 3 to 5 mg and the cobalt content, calculated as elemental cobalt, is generally from 1 to 50 mg, especially from 9 to 10 mg. Tablets may be scored to assist the adminis tration of divided doses to smaller animals, and multiple doses may be given to larger animals.The optimum dose of the various ingredients for solid preparations e.g. tablets and bolus tablets for cattle can be calculated similarly from the data given above for suspensions. As indicated above, appropriate amounts of other anthelmintic agents can be readily calculated. It will be appreciated that as an alternative to presenting the anthelmintic agent and the selenium to an animal in a single preparation, these two components may be formulated separately and administered simultaneously or substantially simultaneously. The present invention accordingly also provides a pack which comprises an anthelmintic agent and, in conjunction or close juxtaposition therewith, a selenium salt. The anthelmintic agent is in the form of a veterinary preparation and is preferably in admixture or conjunction with a carrier suitable for use in a veterinary preparation. The preparation may be liquid or solid, and example of preparation forms are given above. As indicated above, suspensions are generally preferred. The content of the anthelmintic agent is preferably as indicated above.The selenium salt may be formulated either alone or in admixture or conjunction with a carrier suitable for veterinary use in solid or liquid form, for example, as tablet, bolus tablet or paste, as a solution or suspension, or as a powder or granules for reconstitution as a solution or suspension prior to use. It is advantageous to provide th selenium in a unit dose form suitable for addition either to the suspension containing the anthelmintic agent or to water, preferably purified water. Tablets and sachets containing the appropriate amount of a selenium salt are examples of suitable dosage forms. The amounts of selenium to be incorporated can be calculated from the data given above. The cobalt salt may be present either as a component of the anthelmintic preparation or as a component of the selenium preparation. Examples of both selenium salts and cobalt salts are given above. The anthelmintic agent containing preparation and the selenium containing preparation should be provided in conjunction with one another or in close juxtaposition to one another for example, the two should be provided close to hand. Preferably, the two components are joined together, one is attached to the other, or both are provided in the same container. The selenium containing preparation, for example, tablets or a sachet containing a powder or granules for reconstitution, may be physically attached to the anthelmintic preparation, for example, a pack or bottle of tablets, or a bottle of liquid preparation. The two components may be provided together in a container, for example, a box or carton. Both components may be solid, both may be liquid, or one may be solid and one may be liquid.As indicated above, liquid forms may be preferred for the anthelmintic preparation, and a pack may comprise a bottle of anthelmintic suspension together with a bottle of selenium containing preparation or a solid selenium preparation, for example, tablets or one or more sachets of powder or granules for reconstitution. Other preparation forms may be provided analogously. The two preparations should be accompanied by in structions regarding their use. The instructions should indicate that the two preparations should be administered simultaneously or substantially simultaneously, with the selenium component preferably being administered immediately after the anthelmintic component. The instructions should indicate that the selenium component can be added to the anthelmintic component, if this is appropriate. The selenium component can be administered separately. The appropriate dose of both components should be indicated. It may be convenient to provide the selenium component in units suitable for reconstitution in a predetermined amount of either water or anthelmintic suspension. The user may then decide whether to add the selenium component to the anthelmintic preparation, or to make it up with water and use it separately. The recommended treatment times for sheep with a preparation of the invention are as follows Ewes in the period within 4 6 weeks of lambing. In addition, further treatments may be given approximately 4 6 weeks after lambing and prior to service the former to assist in reduction of pasture larval contamination and the latter to improve bodily condition and, therefore, conception rate. Such additional treatments by providing cobalt and selenium will aid in body condition maintenance and improve fertility.Lambs at 4 6 weeks of age and monthly thereafter to maintain optimal growth rate. Treatments may have to be more frequent in areas where Nematodirus infection occurs.Bought in treat on arrival and thereafter as for ewes Sheep lambs, but particularly as with all sheep when moving to clean pasture. Treatment of cattle could be carried out as follows Calves in their first grazing season in a set stocked system, dose at 3 and 6 weeks post turnout and again at housing. Alternatively, dose and move to clean pasture in mid summer, and dose again at housing. Cattle in subsequent grazing seasons dose prior to movement to clean pasture and at housing. Cows dose prior to calving. As indicated above, we have found, surprisingly, that the safety margin for selenium administration is increased greatly when the selenium is combined with an anthelmintic agent, particularly fenbendazole. The LD50 of elemental selenium per os in sheep is considered to be 0.5 mg kg W.M. Allen, Institute for Research onAnimal Diseases, Compton , whereas we have found that administration of oral dose levels of elemental selenium of up to 2.0 mg kg were tolerated, no signs of drug toxicity being observed in any of the treated animals. This decrease in toxicity was quite unexpected, and we believe that there is a safety margin of at least 25 times the recommended dose of the preparation of the invention.This is of considerable practical importance, as there is risk of killing livestock by administering an overdose of selenium using trace element preparations currently available, whereas it is virtually impossible to administer a fatal dose of selenium using a preparation of the present invention. The following Examples illustrate the invention.The anthelmintic agents denoted by their generic names are as follows.Fenbendazol 5 Phenyl thio 2 benzimidazoecarbamic acid metlnylester Oxfendazol 5 Phenylsulfinyl 2 benzimidazolecarbamic acid methylesterAlbendazol 5 Propyl thio 2 benzimidazolecarbamic acid methylesterOxibendazol 5 Propoxy 2 benzimidazolecal bamic acid methylesterParbendazol 5 Butyl 2 benzimidazolecarbamic acid methylesterMebendazol 5 Benzoyl 2 benzimidazolecarhamic acid methylesterFlubendazol 5 4 Fluorobenzoyl 2 benzimidazolecarbamic acid methylesterCambendazol 2 4 Thiazolyl 5 benzimidazolecarbamic acid isopropylesterThiabendazol 2 4 Thiazolyl benzimidazole Example 1Composition per ml Fenbenda zole 25.000 mgColloidal silicon dioxide 30.000 mgSodium methylhydroxybenzoate 1.994 mgSodium propylhydroxybenzoate 0.216 mgSodium carboxymethyl cellulose 14.506 mgPolyvinylpyrrolidone 19.342 mgSodium citrate 31.590 mgCitric acid 31.350 mgCobalt sulphate hepthydrate 4.500 mgSodium selenate decahydrate 60 w w solution 3.167 mgPurified water to 1.0 mlProcedure A mixing vessel was charged with water that had been filtered through a 0.45 ssm filter.The following ingredients were added, with mixing to disperse them citric acid, sodium citrate, cobalt sulphate, sodium selenate solution, sodium methylhydroxybenzoate, sodium propylhydroxybenzoate and colloidal silicon dioxide. The following ingredients were added via an in line homogenisation unit sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone and fenbendazole. Circulation through the in line homogeniser was continued until a uniform dispersion was achieved. The pH was checked and adjusted to 5.9 with citric acid if necessary. The resulting pink suspension was filled into 2 litre containers. This suspension contains 0.4 mg ml elemental selenium and 0.94 mg ml elemental cobalt. Example 2 Determination of efficacy and toxicity levels MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals Twenty, six to eight month old lambs were made available for the purpose of this investigation. The lambs were allocated to five groups n 4 on the basis of mean faecal egg counts determined on each of three successive days. Prior to treatment, all lambs were weighed. Lambs were maintained at grass as a single group for the duration of the study. TREATMENTS Group 1 Untreated controlsGroup 2 Treated with 5 mg kg fenbendazole as Panacur 2.5 Suspension Commercial batch, Panacur , is a Trade Mark Composition of Panacur 2.5 as described in Example 1 with the omission of the selenium and cobalt components.Group 3 Treated with 5 mg kg fenbendazole as a develop mental formulation see below Group 4 Treated with 25 mg kg fenbendazole as a developmental formulatIon see below Group 5 Treated with 50 mg kg fenbendazole as a develop mental formulation see below All treatments were administered per os. DEVELOPMENTAL FORMULATIONProcedure As described in Example 1Composition per ml Fenbendazole 25.000 mgColloidal silicon dioxide 30.000 mgSodium methylhydroxybenzoate 1.994 mgSodium propylhydroxybenzoate 0.216 mgSodium carboxymethyl cellulose 14.506 mg Polyvinylpyrrol idone 19.542 mgSodium citrate 31.590 mgCitric acid 31.350 mgCobalt sulphate heptahydrate 4.500 mgSodium Selenate decahydrate 4.700 mgPurified Water to 1.000 ml Groups 4 and 5 thus received five and ten times respectively the recommended dose of fenbendazole and cobalt, and 12.5 and 25 times respectively the recommended dose of selenium.Parasitological examinations Faecal egg counts were performed using the modifiedMcMaster technique on samples taken directly from the rectum of lambs pre treatment and at seven, eleven, eighteen and twenty five days post treatment. Groups 1, 2 and 3 were slaughtered at eleven days post treatment and post mortem examinations carried out.The abomasum, small intestine and large intestine of each animal were removed and the contents collected. The abomasal mucosa was digested in a pepsin hydrochloric acid mixture for six hours. Numbers of helminth species present were calculated from aliquot samples of the organ contents abomasal digests being examined in toto . Clinical examinations Clinical examinations were carried out on all lambs daily post treatment for the duration of the study. RESULTS No signs of drug associated toxicity were noted in any of the treated animals. Faecal egg counts of all lambs are given in Table 1.Treatment with the commercially available or experimental formulations virtually eliminated faecal egg excretions. Worm counts obtained from lambs in Groups 1 3 at slaughter are recorded in Table II. A mixed nematode burden was present in the untreated lambs Haemonchus, Ostertagia and Trichostrongylus spp. being present in the abomasum Cooperia, Nematodirus and Trichostrongylus spp. in the small intestine and Chabertia and Trichuris spp.in the large intestine. Treatment with both formulations virtually eliminated nematode burdens, there being no significant difference in efficacy between the two formulations. CONCLUSIONS 1. Inclusion of the trace elements, cobalt and selenium, in Panacur 2.5 Suspension had no deleterious effect on anthelmintic efficacy.2. Oral dose levels of up to 1.9 mg kg of elemental cobalt as CoSo4. 71120 and 2.0 mg kg of elemental selenium as Na2SeO4 1OH2O were tolerated, no signs of drug toxicity being noted in any of the treated lambs.

Method A group of 23 heifers was made available for tis study. The cattle had been at grass over the summer and had recently been housed when sampled for allocation to treatment group. Cattle in all three groups were housed in one pen. Faeces samples were collected from all the heifers on two successive days1 and were examined for the presence of worm eggs. On the basis of these worm egg counts the heifers were allocated to one of three treatment groups as shown in Table 1. On the day after second sampling, the cattle were weighed and treated appropriately as indicated in Table 1.Thereafter, faeces samples were collected from the cattle on days 4, 7 and 17 following treatment. Faecal worm egg counts were carried out using the modified McMaster technique. Results The nematode eggs observed in the faeces samples were of the strongyle species and the results of faecal egg counts for all the heifers are shown in Table 2. Both anthelmintic preparations were shown to result in elimination of faecal egg excretion. Conclusions The inclusion of selenium and cobalt does not affect the anthelmintic efficacy of the preparation ofExample 3.

Eight Friesian heifers weighing between 330 and 420 kg were treated with the preparation at the recommended dose of 7.5 ml per 100 kg body weight. Four Friesian cattle weighing between 930 and 990 kg were treated orally with the preparation at five times the recommended dose i.e. 37.5 ml per 100 kg. A further four Friesan cattle weighing between 870 and 1030 kg were treated orally with the preparation at ten times the recommended dose i.e. 75 mg per 100 kg. Table 1 shows the computed and actual dose administered relative to live weight. The cattle were observed daily for a period of 21 days following treatment for any signs at adverse effect. Results and Conclusions No signs of adverse toxicity were observed in cattle treated with up to ten times the recommended dose of the formulation. Oral administration of up to 20 mg kg of selenium and 25 mg kg of cobalt in combination with 75 mg kg of fenbendazole was carried out in cattle with no adverse effect observed.
