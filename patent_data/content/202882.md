# TRANSFER FEED MECHANISM FOR POWER PRESSES

## Abstract
A transfer feed machanism 44 , for use in a power press, is disclosed. The feed mechanism 44 comprises multiple finger units 14 for moving successive workpieces along a plurality of different axes so as to transfer the workpieces to desired work stations in desired positions and attitudes. The feed mechanism 44 includes a power takeoff 12 from the main drive 30 of the power press 10 , a plurality of drive means connected to the power takeoff for driving the finger units 14 along the different axes in synchronism with the power press, and a secondary drive motor 108a for driving the finger units 14 along at least one of the axes indepen dently of the power takeoff. The drive means includes at least one differential mechanism 106 connected to both the pow er takeoff 12 and the secondary drive motor 108a to permit the finger units 14 to be selectively drive by either the power takeoff or the secondary drive motor.
