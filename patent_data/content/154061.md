# AN EXTRUSION DIE

## Abstract
An extrusion die comprises a inner plate 11 mounted within an annular outer plate 12. Shaped extrusion orifices 20, from which the material being extruded is emitted, are defined by aligned grooves 15, 18 formed at the mating edge surfaces of the inner and outer plates 11, 12 respectively. The die may be fabricated utilizing conventional equipment and may be employed to achieve detailed cross sectional con figurations of extruded materials.
