# MOLDED THREE DIMENSIONAL FIBROUS SURFACED ARTICLE AND METHOD OF PRODUCING SAME

## Abstract
Three dimensional molded articles suitable for use as fibrous surfaced panels for automobile trunk compartments and the like are produced by molding a heated non woven web 10 formed of a blend of relatively high melting fibers 14 and relatively low melting thermoplastic fibers 15 . The low melting fibers 15 form a multiplicity of bonds 16 which impart shape retentive rigidity to the nonplanar three dimensional web. A feature of the molded article is that the low melting fibers 15 present at one surface 11 of the web have a fibrous form, while the low melting fibers 15 present at the opposite surface 12 of the web 10 have portions 16 which exhibit a nonfibrous fused form and form said bonds 16 .
