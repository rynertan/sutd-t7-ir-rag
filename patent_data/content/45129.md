# Masked antifoggant compounds for silver photographic systems.

## Abstract
Novel benzyl compounds are provided with nuclear substituents such that a net electron withdrawing effect occurs at the α carbon atom of the benzyl structure, the α carbon atom being substituted by a radical which, upon release during a photographic process, forms a photographically active antifoggant, toner, spectral sen sitizer, dye, color coupler, silver halide solvent, sta bilizer, hardener or accelerator. When incorporated into a photographic emulsion or developer the compounds provide controlled imagewise release of development image modifier compounds after developer oxidation products have been formed in the course of the develop ment process. For example, nitrobenzyl masked phenyl mercaptotetrazole PMT , incorporated into a silver halide emulsion, reacts with developer oxidation products via an electron transfer mechanism to release the potent development restrainer PMT.
