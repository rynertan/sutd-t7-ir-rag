# Rubber compositions and related articles having improved metal adhesion and metal adhesion retention.

## Abstract
Rubber compositions and metal reinforced rubber ply members have improved metal adhesion and metal ad hesion retention. The improvement comprises admixing from about 0.5 to about 10.0 parts per hundred rubber phr of bis 2 mercaptobenzothiazato nickel with a vulcanizable rubber composition prior to combining the metal and rubber and then curing. A method for improving the metal adhesion and metal adhesion retention between a vulcanizable rub ber and metal member includes the step of dispersing from about 0.5 to about 10.0 phr of nickel in a vulcanizable rubber composition prior to curing.
