# Vinylidene chloride polymer microgels and use thereof for the preparation of coatings.

## Abstract
Discrete, crosslinked vinylidene chloride polymer mi crogels, having a latex particle size of less than one mi cron and a gel content of 25 to 99 percent, such microgels being obtained by emulsion polymerizing a 50 to 95 parts by weight of vinylidene chloride, b 5 to 50 parts by weight of a copolymerizable ethylenically unsaturated co monomer, and c 0.1 to 10 parts by weight of a copoly merizable crosslinking polyfunctional comonomer. Such mi crogels have been found to have wide applicability as addi tives for synthetic foams and fibers, and for the preparation of improved coatings, films, and redispersible latexes.
