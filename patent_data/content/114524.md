# Production of high performance optical spatial filters.

## Abstract
High performance optical spatial filters are produced photographically with an apparatus that directs a coherent beam of light 50 through or off a subject 66 and into a lens 68 . The lens 68 focuses the diffracted and or reflected light to define a Fourier transform of the subject information. A filter is produced by exposing a photographic plate at the Fourier transform plane 69 , processing the plate, and repositioning it. A halogram 88 is recorded through the processed plate with the apparatus, which directs a reference beam 52 to a holographic recording plane. A second photographic plate is placed at the transform plane 69 and exposed with light directed through the hologram from a direction conjugate to the reference beam 52 . The second plate is then processed. Successive generations of filters may also be produced. A method of using the filters of isolating nonperiodic defects in IC photomasks and wafers is also disclosed.
