# PERMANENT MAGNET PRIME MOVER

## Abstract
A permanent magnet prime mover has a plurality of rotor permanent magnets 2 which are mounted on the periphery of a rotor 1 at a constant center angle, and a plurality of casing permanent magnets 4 which are arranged on the interior periphery of a casing 3 housing the rotor 1 at a constant center angle to face to one another with the same polarity. By moving the casing magnets 4 close to the rotor magnets 2 in the radial direction in order, a rotation force is given to the rotor 1 to rotate the rotor 1 continuously by utilizing repulsive force of the magnets 2, 4 which is strong in proportion to the inverse square of the distance of the gap between the opposing magnets 2, 4 .
