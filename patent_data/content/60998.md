DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Referring now more particularly to the drawings, and specifically to Figure 1 thereof, a connector is there generally designated 10, particularly adapted for a battery terminal post of an automotive type battery not shown .The connector may be integrally fabricated of a single sheet of electrically conductive material, such as ETP copper or equivalent, for its well known advantageous characteristics the connector 10 may include a receiver 11 for a battery terminal post, and outstanding from the receiver a terminal extension, tube or barrel 12 for connection to a battery cable, or the like, as by crimping, soldering, or both. More specifically, the connector 10 is formed of an elongate strip having its medial portion arcuately bent into a bight region 16 having an arcuate extent of more than 1800 and less than 3600, say roughly,approximate ly 3000. From the ends of the arcuate or bight portion 16 may extend integral tabs or end portions 17 in parallel spaced facing relation with respect to each other. The tabs or end portions 17 are each formed with a through opening or hole 18, which holes may be in substantial alignment with each other. Extending along the longitudinal, upper and lower edges of the strip 15 are upper and lower flanges 19.The flanges 19 are each coextensive with the strip 15, including arcuate flange portions 20 extending along upper and lower edges of the arcuate intermediate bight region 16 and generally straight upper and lower flange portions 21 extending along the upper and lower edges of extension or legs 17. The arcuate flange portions 20 extend radially outwardly from the bight region 16 to leave the interior of the bight region generally cylindrical and the flange portions 21 extend outwardly from respective legs 17, to leave the legs generally flat on their inner or facing sides. The arcuate strip portion or bight 16 is formed integrally therewith, generally opposite to the legs or tabs 17 with the tubular extension or barrel 12. As best seen in Figure 2, the barrel or tube 12 projects from the arcuate strip portion 16, radially outwardly, diametrically oppositely with respect to the legs 17.The barrel or tube 12 may be of generally cylindrical configuration, formed from the material of the strip 12 to define an open ended tube, and may have its radially outer end flared, as at 25. More specifically, the tube or barrel 12 may be spaced vertically between the lower and upper arcuate flange portions 20, and project generally radially outwardly normal to the axis of the cylindrical formation of the bight region 16. In use, a battery cable, conductor or wire may extend inwardly through the outer barrel end 25 into the barrel 12 and be conductively secured therein, as by solder, crimping, or both. The connector 10 may then be arranged with its receiver 11 receiving a battery terminal post, the strip bight 16 embracing the battery terminal post, and suitable fastener means such as a bolt and nut may engage through openings 18 of legs 17 to urge the latter together. In this manner, the receiver 11 will bind in good electrical connection with a battery terminal post and, the flange portions 21 of one leg 17 may nonrotatably retain a nut for easy tightening and loosening of a fastener through the holes 18. Referring now to Figure 3, an embodiment of connector in accordance with the teachings of the present invention is there generally designated 10a, and may be fabricated of a single integral length of tube stock, such as tubing of electrolytic tough pitch copper, or equivalent. The tubing 15a is, of course, conductive sheet material. One end portion of the tubing 15a remains tubular, as at 12a, to define a barrel opening outwardly, as through a flared end 25a, to receive a battery cable 30. The other end region of the tube 15a is shaped. to define a transversely opening receiver lla, for reception of an electrical connection to a battery terminal post 31. More specifically, the material of tube 15a, except that employed in the barrel 12a, has opposite wall portions 32 and 33 flattened or deformed into facing engagement with each other. The distal end portion of the facing, engaging walls 32, 33 is deformed or drawn into a cupshaped receptacle defining receiver lla. The cup shaped receiver lla is defined of a generally frusto conical side wall 35 tapering toward and terminating at its smaller end in an end wall 36.Extending from the open end or mouth of the cup shaped receiver lla, generally coplanar therewith is a two ply intermediate portion or section 37 connecting the receiver to the barrel 12a, As is well known, battery terminal posts conventionally taper upwardly or outwardly to their free ends,The internal taper of receiver or cup lla is of narrower angle than that of the terminal posts, so that the mouth region 38 of the cup Ila is adapted for snug, frictional circumposition about and good electrical connection with the battery terminal posts. Also, this peripheral receiver post engagement provides an effective seal to the interior of the receiver, to minimize the effects of corrosive atmosphere. In addition, fastener means, such as a set screw 40 may engage threadedly through the side wall 35 of receiver lla into holding engagement with the terminal post 31. Obviously, the one piece connector 10a is capable of economic mass production to achieve highly satisfactory operational characteristics and substantial economy in cost. Another modified embodiment of the present invention is shown in Figure 5, wherein a connector is generally designated 10b, for use in connecting a battery cable 30 to a battery terminal post 31. The connector 10b may include a barrel 12b for crimped and or soldered connection to the cable 30, and connected to the barrel 12b a receiver llb for embracing engagement with and electrical connection to the terminal post 31. The barrel 12b may be fabricated from a length of copper tubing 15b, having one end open, as at 25b, and its other end portion closed, as by flattening of opposite wall regions into facing engagement with each other, as at 37b. The receiver llb may be separate from the barrel 12b in the embodiment of Figure 5, being formed of a single thickness of suitable copper sheet material into a cupshaped configuration having a closed end wall 36b and a peripheral side wall 35b of frusto conical configuration and flaring outwardly or downwardly to an open end 38b.Generally flush with the open receiver end 28b, there may extend radially therefrom a flange or wall portion 42 into overlying relation with the flattened wall portion 37b extending from the barrel 12b. The flange or mouth extension 42 of the receiver llb and the underlying wall portion 37b of the barrel 12b are suitably secured together, as by a rivet 43 to maintain the receiver llb and barrel 12b in electrically connected relation, while permitting of relative swinging movement or articulation therebetween. Further, the receiver or cup llb is advantageously selected of a suitable gauge for optimum mechanical and electrical connection to the received terminal post 31, while the tube stock of barrel 12b is selected for its optimum electrical and mechanical connection to a particular cable size or range of cable sizes.As in the embodiment of Figure 3, the receiver llb of Figure 5 flares toward its open end or mouth 38b having an angle of taper less than that of the terminal post 31, for effective sealing mechanical and electrical connection of the receiver mouth 38b circumferentially about the battery terminal post 31. Of course, in both the embodiments of Figures 3 and 5, the depth or height of the receivers or cups lla and llb is sufficient to permit of the tight engagement about the post, without limiting engagement of the cup end wall with the post. Referring now to Figures 7 9, a further embodiment of the present invention is there generally designated 10c, wherein a barrel or tube 12c may be separate and secured to a cup shaped receiver llc, extending radially therefrom. The barrel or tube 12c may have its radially inner end closed, as at 50, and its outer end open, as at 25c, for receiving a conductor 30,in electrical and mechanical connection therewith. The receiver llc may be formed of a single thickness of suitable copper sheet material into a cup shaped configuration havinq a closed small end wall 36c and a peripheral side wall 35c of frusto conical configuration and flaring outwardly or downwardly to the open end 38c Generally flush with the open receiver end 38c, there may extend radially therefrom a flange or wall portion 51 having upstanding sides or lips 52 defining an upwardly facing channel. The channel 51 extends generally radially outwardly from the lower, wider open end of the receiver llc, and receives the lower inner region of the tube or barrel 12c. Further, the tube or barrel 21c is fixedly secured in the channel 51 by suitable means, such as welding or brazing 53. In addition to the effective frictional taper fit of receiver llc over terminal posts 31c, the receiver may be further fastened to the post by a screw fastener 40c extending downwardly through the upper receiver wall 36c and threadedly into a bore or hole 54 opening upwardly from the terminal post. In the embodiments of Figures 3 9, as the internal taper of the cups is of an angle less than the external taper of the battery posts, the contact between each cup and post assumes an angular, circumferential area defining a circular seal closing the lower end of each cup. If desired, an angular, compressible washer or seal may be circumposed about the lower or base region of each battery post, being there compressed between the battery top wall and larger end of the cup, to further protect the cup to post contact area from adverse environmental effects. Referring now more particularly to Figures 10 12, a battery post terminal is there generally designated 110, and may be advantageously fabricated of ductile conductive material, such as copper or the like. The terminal 110 includes a shell, cover or inverted cup 111 which may be drawn or otherwise suitably formed of sheet copper having an internal configuration tapered for snug frcitional engagement with a battery post. In addition, an apertured lug or eye 112 may be circumposed about the cap or cup 111 and prdvided with a radial extension 113 terminating at its outer end in a cable connector or barrel 114. More particularly, the cap or cup 111 may include a generally circular end wall or closure 116, about which extends a circumferential side wall 117 which flares in the direction away from end wall 116. That is, the circumferential or side wall 117 is configured as the frustum of a cone, and terminates at an open, larger end 118. Extending circumferentially about the open, larger end of cup side wall 117 is a radially outstanding circumferential rim, brim or flange 119. As relatively little stress is applied to the cup 111, relatively light gauge material may be employed at a substantial savings in cost, without sacrifice in quality of performance. The lug 112, radial extension 113 and cable connector 114 are advantageously integrally fabricated and of greater thickness than the cup 111 for withstanding the stresses imposed by a cable and any relative movement between the cable and battery post. As in the illustrated embodiment, the integral lug, extension and barrel 112, 113 and 114 may be fabricated of a length of tube stock, but such fabrication is not essential to the invention. In the illustrated embodiment, the integral tube stock is flattened in the region of lug 112 and extension 113 to define a pair of superposed sheets or layers 120 and 121 for effectively resisting torsional, tensional and other stresses imparted in use. The overlying layers 120 and 121 are apertured or punched, as by a hole 123 to define of the lug 112 an eye. The size of hole 123 is such as to snugly receive and engage about the lower region or cup 111. From the outer end of the flattened radial extension 113 as a continuation thereof, extends the generally cylindrical or tubular barrel 114 which may have its outer end open at 124 and there provided with a radially outstanding flange or lip 125. While frictional circumposition of the eye 112 about the cup 111 will service admirably well in many applications, if it is desired to more firmly secure the eye and cup, this may be accomplished by spot welding, or otherwise, if desired. The inverted cup 11 may be manually frictionally engaged over a battery terminal post, the like tapers affording a firm retention, or if desired, a tool may be employed to more forciby engage the cup over a battery post. A desired cable may be secured in the connector or barrel 114, as by crimping, soldering, or the like. In the embodiment shown in Figure 13, there generally designated 110a, an inverted cup or cap llla is provided which may be substantially identical to the cap 111, including an internal taper slightly smaller than the external taper of a battery post, and a flange or brim 118a about the lower, open end of the cup llla. An apertured lug or eye 112a is snugly circumposed about the cup llla, preferably seated on the brim 118a and additionally secured thereto if desired. From the eye 112a there extends a radial extension 113a which is substantially greater in radial extent than the radial extension 113 of the previously described embodiment. From the outer end of the radial extension 113a there continues a cable connector or barrel 114a which may be essentially the same as the connector or barrel 114 of the previously described embodiment. In addition, in the embodiment of Figure 13, there is an auxiliary connector 130, which includes a barrel 131, from which extends a lug 132 secured to the elongate radial extension 113a. That is, the lug 132 of the connector 130 may seat in contacting engagement on the extension 113a, and be suitably secured thereto, as by spot welding, or otherwise. In this embodiment it will be appreciated that a pair of cable connectors or tap offs 114a and 130 may be associated in electrically conductive relation with a single battery post cover or cup llla, as when plural conductor connection is required. A further embodiment is shown in Figure 14, the battery post terminal there being generally designated 110b, and including a cup or cover lllb, eye 112b, extension 113b and barrel 114b, all of which may be essentially identical to the cup 111, eye 112, extension 113 and barrel 114 ofFigures 10 12. However, there is provided an additional eye 112c, radial extension 113c and barrel 114c, which may be essentially identical to the eye 112b, extension 113b and barrel 114b. However, the eye 112c is circumposed about the cup lllb and superposed on the eye 112b, and the radial extension 113c extends at an angle with respect to the radial extension 113b, being an angle of 1800 in the drawing. Of course, additional eyes may be superposed or stacked on the eyes 112b and 112c and in this case it is preferred that the eyes be spot welded to each other and the brim 118b. Thus, a plurality of cables by plural tap offs may be connected to a single battery post by the embodiment of Figure 14 as well as that ofFigure 13.In the latter Figure, the radial extension 113a may be further elongated to provide for additional connector parts similar to part 130 and additional lugs similar to lug 132 may be superposed and welded together, if desired. To assure a desired press fit and intimate contact between the lowermost eye and the cap or cover, as in Figures 10 12, the internal diameter of opening 123 is advantageously slightly less than the maximum external diameter of the side wall 117 at the brim or flange 118. Referring now more particularly to Figure 15, a battery terminal construction is illustrated therein and generally designated 210. The terminal may be substantially completely fabricated of ductile conductive material, such as copper or the like, and may include a connector cap 211 and cable connector or barrel 212 extending from the cap. More specifically, the cap 211 may be an inverted cup, cover or shell, say drawn or otherwise suitably formed of sheet copper and having a brim, lip or flange 215, provided with a radial extension or tab. The cable connector barrel 212 may include a tubular portion 217 receiving and suitably secured, as by crimping, to a cable 218, which extends into one end of the tube 217.The other end of the tube 217 is flattened, as at 200, or otherwise formed into a tab or extension for facing engagement with the cup tab or extension 216. The superposed tabs 216 and 200 may be suitably connected together, as by a rivet 221, to assure electrical continuity, and the rivet may be formed to define a pivotal connection between the cap and cable connector. Considering the cap 211 now more in detail, it may be drawn from flat material to include an outer end wall or closure 225, say of generally circular configuration, from which extends a peripheral side wall or sleeve 226, generally normal to the end wall 225. The sleeve 226 may include an outer sleeve end portion 227 extending directly from and integrally connected to the end wall 225, and being of generally cylindrical configuration. Stated otherwise, the outer end portion 227 of sleeve 226 may have zero taper. The sleeve 226 further includes an inner end portion 228 which extends lonaitudinally from the inner end of the outer end sleeve portion 227, integrally therewith, and diverges or flares in the inward direction, away from the cylindrical outer sleeve end portion 227. Thus, the inner sleeve end portion 28 defines the frustum of a cone, being generally coaxial with the cylindrical outer cap end portion 227. From the larger, inner end of the conical or flaring inner sleeve portion 228, radially thereabout, extends the flange or lip 215, lying generally in a plane normal to the axis of the sleeve. As best seen in Figure 16, the flared inner end portion 228 of the sleeve 226 is in firm, snug frictional engagement with a received battery terminal post 230.This engagement may be effected by manually placing the cap 211 over the post 230 and twisting, as by grasping the barrel 212 and or lip 215 and bearing downwardly while turning. In Figures 17 and 18 are shown, in phantom, battery terminal posts 230a and 230b, respectively which are of slightly different taper, which may be within commercial tolerances. In particular, battery terminal post 230a is of a greater taper and battery terminal post 230b is of a lesser taper. In applying cap 211a to post 230a, there is illustrated contact of the inner sleeve end portion 228a at the lip or flange 215a with the battery terminal post. In the embodiment of Fiqure 18, the cap 211b makes contact with the battery terminal post 230b at the inner end of the outer sleeve end region 226b, where it joins with the outer end of the inner sleeve end region 228b.There is firm mechanical connection and intimate area engagement for electrical contact in both the extreme conditions of Figures 17 and 18, as well as all intermediate post taper conditions. It is advantageous that the overall length of cap 211 approximate the height of a battery terminal post and that the length of cylindrical or pilot, outer end region 226 be approximately 2 3 overall length, while the length of the inner sleeve or flare end region 228 approximate 1 3 the overall length. With a flared or inner end region 228 approximately 1 3 the overall length, the outer end region 11 is of sufficiently small diameter to provide a convenient pilot for assembly through the eyes of tapoff lugs, as will appear presently. Also, with the flared inner end sleeve portion 228 sufficiently short, as noted above, a plurality of stacked tap off lug eyes may be circumposed about the flared sleeve portion without excessive gap for effective securement, also appearing presently. In the embodiment shown in Figure 19, a cap is generally designated 211c and may be substantially similar to the cap 211 of Figures 15 and 16. That is, the cap llc includes a generally circular end wall or closure 225c, and outer sleeve end portion 226c extending integrally from the periphery of end wall 225c, and generally normal to the end wall in the configuration of a cylinder or tube having a taper of zero or less than the taper of a battery terminal post. Extending from the inner end of the outer sleeve end portion 226c is an inner sleeve end portion 28c which flares in the direction away from the outer sleeve end portion 26c, having a taper approximating that of a battery terminal post.Extending circumferentially about the larger end of the flared sleeve portion 228c is a peripheral lip, rim or flange 215c, which may be generally annular and without a tab or extension corresponding to the tab or extension of Figures 15 and 16. The cable connector 212c of Figure 19 may include a tubular barrel 217c having one end region flattened, as at 220c, and centrally apertured, as at 235 to define an open lug or eye 236. As seen in Figure 5, the open lug or eye 236 is of two superposed layers and seated firmly on the annular flange 215c, Further, the internal diameter of the circular aperture 235 of lug 236 may be such as to form a snug or force fit circumposed about the inner sleeve end portion 228c when the lug is seated on the flange 215c. In addition to the snug frictional fit of lug 236 about sleeve portion 228c, or as an alternative thereto, the apertured lug may be otherwise suitably secured to the rim or flange 215c, say by spot welding, as at 237. In the embodiment shown in Figure 20, there is a connector cap 211d essentially similar to the connector cap 211c, including an outer sleeve end portion 226d which may be generally cylindrical or of a taper less than that of a battery terminal post 230d. A flaring inner end sleeve portion 228d extends longitudinally inwardly from the inner end of a sleeve portion 226d and is provided on its inner end with a generally annular circumferential flange 215d, all of which may be the same as the cap 211c of Figure 19. However, the cap 211d may include an outer end wall or closure 225d having a central opening, as at 240 for passing a fastener 241, such as a screw, or other suitable fastener into securing engagement with the post 230d.More specifically, the headed and threaded fastener 241 may engage through the outer end wall opening 240 with its threaded shank 242 entering into threaded engagement in a suitable hole 243 formed in the outer end of the terminal post 230d. With the shank 242 secured in the post 230d, the head 241 may engage the outer surface of the end wall 225d, to secure the cap 211d in a firm electrical contacting circumposition about the post 230d.Also shown in Figure 20 are a plurality of cable connectors having apertured end lugs 220d superposed in aligned relation with each other on the circumferential flange 215d and in snug frictional or forced engagement about the flaring inner end sleeve portion 228d. While a pair of apertured lugs 220d are shown in Figure 20 as frictionally circumposed about the inner sleeve end portion 228d, it is understood that three or more such cable connector lugs may also be frictionally engaged or force fit about the flaring inner sleeve end portion 228d. If desired, the upper or outer face of the outermost lug 200d may be deformed inwardly into forced retaining engagement with the sleeve portion 228d. For example, by ring staking, a bead 245 may be formed on the inner margin of the aperture of the uppermost lug 220d, the bead engaging the sleeve portion 228 to retain the uppermost lug on the sleeve portion, and to retain any other lugs firmly clamped in position about the sleeve portion 228d between the outermost lug and the flange 215d. From the foregoing, it is seen that the present invention provides a uniquely improved battery post terminal connector which is extremely simple in construction, economic in manufacturing steps and materials, durable and reliable throughout a long useful life, and which otherwise fully accomplishes its intended objects. Although the present invention has been described in some detail by way of illustration and example for purposes of clarity of understanding, it is understood that certain changes and modifications may be made within the spirit of the invention.
