# Ink jet printer.

## Abstract
An ink jet printer includes housing means defining an air tunnel and having an entry port 74 connectible to a source of pressurised air, a multinozzle head 10 operable to project streams of ink droplets into the air tunnel, droplet charging electrode means 24 and gutter means 73. The tunnel defined by the housing means has a first section 72 of substantially greater cross sectional area than the remainder of the tunnel and serving as a settling chamber to reduce turbulence in air injected into the tunnel through the entry port, an intermediate section 81 of progressively decreasing cross sectional area to increase the velocity of the air and a fin al section extending from the nozzle head to the gutter means, the fin al section being of sub stantially constant cross section. The arrangement provides a substantially non turbulent air flow of uniform velocity in the fin al section of the air tunnel. Thus, ink droplet streams from the multinozzle head are projected into a lamin ar air flow of uniform velocity.
