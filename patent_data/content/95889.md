# Solid cosmetic compositions and methods of preparing them.

## Abstract
A solid cosmetic composition is provided having improved pay off qualities and resistance to breakage and cracking which is formed by mixing two liquid dispersion slurries, the first slurry being non aqueous or substantially so and comprising calcium sulfate hemihydrate, a hydroxylic liquid and cosmetic oils, fragrances, colorants or fillers, and the second slurry comprising water insoluble inorganic or organic particulate materials, colorants and water the slurries being combined in proportions such that the mixture contains water in excess of that sufficient to totally convert the calcium sulfate hemihydrate to calcium sulfate dihydrate. The mixture solidifies within about 30 minutes to form a smooth, solid cosmetic composition, but the separate slurries have long storage life and can readily be handled.

## Description
SOLID COSMETIC COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS OF PREPARING THEM The present invention is directed to solid cosmetic compositions which provide improved product release while retaining excellent strength and resistance to breakage. There is a need in the art for improved solid cosmetic compositions which exhibit excellent release of colourants and filler materials known as pay off properties in the art and fragrance, yet which exhibit sufficient physical integrity and strength after molding to be usable without breaking or cracking and without partial deterioration into dust when rubbed. There is also a need to solve the problem in the current art that the shade of certain colourants used, such as carmine lakes, often looks different in the cake as compared with the colour when rubbed onto the skin. Methods presently used to form moldable cosmetic compositions call for the use of essentially dry powder compositions which are then mixed with oily or waxy material or binding and are then compressed, usually with a hydraulic or mechanical press, to form solid cosmetics and toiletries. Another method known in the prior art is to form a wet slurry i.e. a liquid dispersion which is either poured into a mould, extruded to form a stick or formed into a shape from a paste, then dried in an oven. These are then used as is, after removal from the mould, or subsequently sanded to the desired shape. Some disadvantages of these methods are the requirements for hydraulic or mechanical presses, extrusion equipment and oven drying equipment.Furthermore, many compositions known in the prior art suffer from the disadvantages of being scratchy or dusty when rubbed against the skin, having poor or little pay off properties, poor skin adhesion or easily breaking or cracking if dropped. Methods of preparation of the solid cosmetic compositions of the prior art may also be inconvenient and difficult since the dry materials and the wet or waxy materials must be kept separate until they are placed in the container which will accommodate the finished product. This requires the movement and grinding of bulk solid materials within the processing plant which is more difficult to handle than liquids or pumpable dispersions. Another disadvantage of known cosmetic compositions using calcium sulfate hemihydrate is that once water is added to a conventional dry blend consisting of the colour, fillers and calcium sulfate it must be used completely within an hour or less depending upon the quantity of accelerators or retarders used because the hydration reaction will occur and the cosmetic will either partially or totally solidify in the mixing or filling equipment.Moreover, the strength of the final cosmetic block may be lessened if pouring is not completed within fifteen minutes after addition of the water. The present invention provides solid moldable cosmetic compositions and methods of preparations thereof which do not suffer from the above disadvantages, and which permit continuous addition of water to a calcium sulfate hemihydrate phase as needed to maintain filling, setting time and consistent strength of the ultimate solid product. The method also prepares solid moldable cosmetic compositions utilizing pumpable slurries which because they are each non solidifying may be prepared and stored until needed. It also allows multi coloured cosmetic blocks to be prepared. The present cosmetic compositions may include platelet minerals and organic polymer resins together with the calcium sulfate hemihydrate which provide good product release, skin adhesion and excellent strength in the presence of pigments. The present invention is directed to moldable solid cosmetic compositions containing calcium sulfate dihydrate gypsum and organic or inorganic particulate material, such as platelet minerals, which produce improved pay off properties and resistance to breakage and to the method of preparing said compositions utilizing at least two pumpable slurries, the first of which Slurry A contains calcium sulfate hemihydrate and optionally cosmetic fragrances and or a low HLB surfactant in a water miscible hydroxylic liquid selected from alkanols containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a glycol containing from 2 to 8 carbon atoms or mixtures thereof and a second pumpable slurry Slurry B wh ich contains water, water insoluble particulate materials and, optionally, pigments and water insoluble organic polymer resins such as ureaformaldehyde polymer powders.The two slurries may be separately prepared and stored indefinitely.Slurry A may optionally contain small amounts of water, emollients, fragrance oils, microencapsulated oils, calcium sulfate dihydrate and other ingredients which either accelerate or retard the subsequent hydration reaction.Water is one of the latter but Slurry A will not contain more than a very little water, say 5 percent maximum. Preferred compositions may be made from these slurries having, when admixed, from 2 to 5 parts of hydroxylic liquid per 10 to 12 parts of calcium sulfate hemihydrate, 40 to 45 parts of water and 15 to 40 parts of particulate filler encapsulated cosmetic ingredients may be included in this figure . The remainder, to 100 parts all parts being by weight will be the cosmetic ingredient s . More preferred compositions are made from 3 to 4 parts of hydroxylic liquid, 11 parts of calcium sulfate hemihydrate, 41 to 43 parts of water and 19 to 38 parts of filler. In preparing the compositions according to the present invention, Slurry A is mixed with Slurry B in proportions such that there is an amount of water present in excess of that sufficient to totally convert the calcium sulfate hemihydrate to calcium sulfate dihydrate, whereby the resultant pourable mixture solidifies within about thirty minutes to form a smooth, solid cosmetic composition.While calcium sulfate has been previously used as a powder base in solid cake cosmetics, these had poor pay off characteristics and were rough and scratchy to use. Also, in preparing such cosmetics the calcium sulfate and other solid components of the cosmetic have heretofore been kept separate from any liquid or waxy component until mixed for filling the final container.See, for example, U. S. Patent 1,968,475 to Beckwith et al. A problem utilizing calcium sulfate is that when it is mixed with.excess water it almost immediately sets up as Plaster of Paris gypsum and gives a rough, scratchy and grainy appearance and feel. If insufficient calcium sulfate is present, then the cosmetic block will crumble or break if dropped. If calcium sulfate hemihydrate is used in quantities sufficient to produce a strong cosmetic block, it will result in a cosmetic with insufficient pay off properties. The present invention obviates these problems by making use of the structural integrity provided by sufficient calcium sulfate hemihydrate in a pumpable slurry which may be stored indefinitely prior to utilization to form the final product.According to the present invention, separate pumpable slurries are dreated, one of which comprises calcium sulfate hemihydrate dispersed in a substantially water free liquid Slurry A . Preferably such liquid may be hydroxylic liquid substantially miscible with water, selected from an alkanol containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a glycol containing from 2 to 6 carbon atoms or mixtures thereof, for example, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, or butylene glycol. This slurry may also contain up to about 20 by weight of various cosmetic materials such as fragrance oils, emollients, microencapsulated oils, surface active agent, emulsifiers, colorants and or fillers. Preferred fillers are inorganic platelet materials such as micronized mica, bismuth oxychloride coated mica or titanium dioxide coated mica.Platey talc may also be used in forming stick compositions. Preferably the slurry may contain approximately 10 parts by weight of the hydroxylic liquid, 70 parts by weight of a mixture of cosmetic fragrances, colorants, or fillers. Suitable slnrry thickening agents such as water and or sorbitan sesquioleate may also be added. While it is necessary that the combination remain substantially water free during storage, the presence of less than 5 , preferably less than 3 and most preferably about 0.5 to 2 by weight, of water is beneficial to control setting time of the final composition.In a second pumpable slurry Slurry B , there will be dispersed in water, various cosmetic colorants, microencapsulated fragrance or cosmetic oils and or fillers, particulate materials such as the platey inorganic materials mica or talc, and or surface active agents, gel retarding or accelerating chemicals.Preferred microencapsulated fragrance or cosmetic oil may be encapsulated in a urea formaldehyde resin shell Aminoplast . Slurry B provides the water required for the hydration reaction which will take place when the pumpable slurries are combined to form the final product. The composition of this aqueous slurry will be selected to prevent hard packing during storage so that a constant composition may be achieved in slurry form upon simple agitation. Preferably the slurry may contain approximately equal parts by weight of water and solid materials comprising encapsulated material, colors and platey inorganic materials. A preferred composition is 55 by weight water, and about 45 by weight water insoluble platey organic or inorganic particulate material minerals such as mica or talc.The encapsulated material may be fragrance or emollient oil microencapsulated in urea formaldehyde resin.The cosmetic fragrances and oils in either of the above described pumpable slurries may be microencapsulated.Each slurry may contain different colorants whereby mixture of the slurries a final uniformly colored or multicolored solid cosmetic composition may be obtained.The above described pumpable slurries may be separately stored for an indefinite period and may be transported through the production areas through pipes and pumps.When it is desired to form the final cosmetic compositions, all that is required is to combine the slurry containing the calcium sulfate hemihydrate hereinafter calledSlurry A and the aqueous. slurry. hereinafter calledSlurry B in proportions in excess of that sufficient to totally convert the calcium sulfate hemihydrate to calcium sulfate dihydrate. .hen the pumpable slurries are formulated in the preferred portions as described above, then it is preferred that 15 parts by weight of Slurry be mixed with 85 parts by weight of Slurry B with sufficient agitation to assure uniformity. The mixture will solidify after combination in less than 30 minutes, usually in about 10 to 20 minutes, to form an improved cosmetic composition.The two pumpable slurry parts may be continuously combined by a proportioning pump that will maintain a constant combined slurry composition.Because the setting time of the combined slurries is not instantaneous, the combined slurry may be handled and processed from about 10 to 30 minutes without solidification of product. This is particularly convenient for the cleaning of equipment such as pumps and lines with water prior to terminating production operations.As set forth above, the presence of a small quantity of water in Part A is not detrimental and has been found to actually be advantageous in terms of controlling the setting time and in maintaining a more easily redispersible form after storage. Less than 3 , preferably about 0.5 to 2 water in Slurry A by weight is preferred.Optionally an equal part of a low HLB surfactant may also be included in Slurry A to further improve redispersability. Preferably less than about 3 by weight of a surfactant having an HLB of 1.8 to 6.0, such as sorbitan sesquioleate, may be used.Exemplary compositions according to the present inventions are set forth below. Example 1In order to test the effect of using various platelet minerals three compositions 1A, 1B and 1C shown below were formulated. The dry ingredients of each were preblended and enough water was added to each to make a pourable slurry. No hydroxylic liquid was used.Each slurry was poured into a separate mold while still fluid, and excess water was allowed to evaporate.It was found that platey talc, micronized mica and titanium dioxide coated mica all produced a gypsum composition having improved pay off characteristics.

The mixture solidified in 10 to 20 minutes after combination. The resulting cosmetic composition exhibited superior pay off properties and resistance to breakage and cracking. There was some compaction on standing of Slurry A. Also thickness of Slurry s caused it to be not easily mixed with A.

In order to study the composition as a fragrance sachet, slurries A and B as shown below were formulated to produce a solid block with good fragrance release but no rub out pay off of powder on skin.

Although there was little or no pay off of product when rubbed on the skin, the composition released fragrance continuously for 2 weeks or more with excellent odor fidelity. The solid block did not interfere with either the release or the fidelity of the perfume oil used. Moreover, when the block was warmed, the intensity of fragrance release was enhanced without distorting the fragrance as it would if warmed by burning in conventional fragrance candle form.In order to study the formulation of a solid dusting powder, slurries A and B shown below were developed to provide for both good pay off on the skin and fragrance release.Example 6 with pay off t by WeightSlurry A Gellant Phase of CompositionEthyl alcohol 20.0 Perfume oil 10.0Deionized water 2.0Surfactant s 2.0Calcium sulfate hemihydrate 66.0 100.0 Slurry BDeionized water 50.0 Microencapsulated perfume oil in AminoplastO resin Shell 30p 49.0Calcium sulfate dihydrate 1.0 100 0 Combination RatioSlurry A 30 parts by weightSlurry B 70 parts by weight After combination the mixture of slurry A and B solidified in about 15 minutes. When completely dry the resulting solid perfumed powder was easily rubbed on skin with a cosmetic puff. The skin deposition had good adhesion and produced a good fidelity fragrance effect on the skin and from the cake. Moreover, when the product on the skin was buffed, the microencapsulated fragrance cells ruptured to release an even greater fragrance intensity with continued fidelity compared to the original perfume oil.The invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments thereof which produced the desired results. Other materials may be substituted for materials disclosed and amounts may be altered at the choosing of the formulator in order to achieve various additional attributes which would be within the skill and knowledge of those of ordinary skill in the art using the teachings of the above specification.
