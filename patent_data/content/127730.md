# OXYGEN BARRIER LAYERS FOR POLYMERIZABLE MATERIALS

## Abstract
The present invention provides a new method of ameliorating oxygen inhibition especially with curable dental material having a polymerizable system including polymeriz able organic compound, and polymerization initiator activat able by actinic radiation. The method involves shaping the dental material into a shaped member having relatively verti cal surface and relatively horizontal surface, preparing a liquid composition, applying the liquid composition to the relatively vertical surface and the relatively horizontal surface of the member, forming a layer from the liquid composition, and applying actinic light to the light curable material through the layer. The method preferably involves including water and organic compound in the liquid composition and providing the layer in an amount of at least about 35 mg dmÂ² on a fully dried weight basis.
