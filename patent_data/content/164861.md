## Description
A TOY This invention relates to a toy. In particular it relates to an educational toy. The invention therefore provides a toy which comprises a spherical shaped base having a plurality of formations thereon and a plurality of curved shaped elements each having a concave surface and a convex surface, each element having a formation on the concave surface thereof and wherein the formation on each of the elements is interengagable with the formations on the base so that the elements may be removably mounted on the base to collectively cover the base, the convex surface of each of the elements being exposed when mounted on the base. The invention will be understood in greater detail from the following description of a preferred embodiment thereof given by way of example only and with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of a spherical shaped base according to the invention Figure 2 is a perspective view of the base of Figure 1 showing elements according to the invention mounted thereon Figure 3 is a perspective view of an element according to the invention for use on the base of Figure 1 Figure 4 is a side elevation of the element of Figure 3 Figure 5 is a perspective view of a second element according to the invention for use on the base of Figure 1 Figure 6 is a side view of the element of Figure 5t Figure. 7 is a perspective view of a second base for use in the invention Figure 8 is an underneath perspective view of a first part of a die for use in the manufacture of the elements used in the invention Figure 9 is a top perspective view of a second part of a die for use in the manufacture of the elements used in the invention and Figure 10 is a cross sectional view of the first part and second part of Figures 8 and 9 in combination taken along the line X X of Figure 8. Referring now to the drawings and in particular toFigures 1 6, there is shown a base 1 of a toy according to the invention which base 1 is in the form of a sphere or globe. On the sphere 1, which may be hollow or solid, is a plurality of formations or holes 2 in spaced apart relationship. In Figures 3 and 4, there is shown an element or piece 3 for mounting on the sphere 1. The piece 3 is slightly curved having a convex side and a concave side, has two pairs of plain edges 5, 6 and has a formation or peg 4 which projects radially from the concave side. The free end of the peg 4 is bulbous being in the form of a knob 4a. A plurality of pieces 3 is used in conjunction with the sphere 1. Each piece 3 may have printed or mounted on the concave side part of an overall pattern which is to be depicted on the sphere 1.In the present example of the invention, the pattern is the outline of the continents of the earth and the user of the toy is required to mount each piece 3 on the sphere l in its correct relative position so that the concave side is exposed and the correct pattern is generated. Each piece 3 is appropriately curved so that when it is mounted in its correct position on the sphere 1, it forms part of a layer or covering which fits flush against the surface of the sphere 1. As seen in Figure 2, when the piece 3 is mounted on the sphere 1, each of the edges 5 represents part of a line of longitude and each of the edges 6 represents a part of a line of latitude. As the peg 4 is located centrally of the piece 3, and as all of the pieces 3 have approximately the same dimensions, it is important that each hole 2 is located equidistant from an adjacent hole 2 on the sphere 1.Reference to Figure 1 will show that each hole 2 is positioned substantially centrally between two adjacent lines of longitude 7 and two adjacent lines of latitude 8 which are shown in dotted outline. To use the toy, initially, the pieces 3 will be separate from the sphere 1 and in a confused assemblage. A piece 3 is selected and placed in position on the sphere 1 by pushing the free end 4a into a hole 2. In order to assist in the correct positioning of the first piece 3, it may be desirable to code the relevant hole 2 and the first piece 3 so that their association can be readily identified.If necessary, further holes and pieces may be coded to assist the user. As mentioned above, it is preferable that the pattern on the pieces 3 when assembled outline the continents of the earth. Clearly, therefore, as more and more pieces are assembled on the sphere 1, the outline becomes more discernable as shown in Figure 2. Eventually, when all the pieces 3 are placed correctly on the sphere 1, the sphere 1 now represents the globe. The purpose of the knob 4a on each peg is to prevent the pieces mounted on the sphere 1 from falling off.Consequently, it is desirable that each of the knobs 4a has a diameter slightly greater than the diameter of any one of said holes 2 and each knob 4a has a certain resilience to permit the knob 4a to enter the hole 2 when the knob 4a is pushed into or pulled from the hole 2. The knob 4a prevents the piece 3 from falling from the sphere 1 under gravity. If desired, each piece 3 may have formations on the edges 5, 6 which are inter engagable. Reference should be made to Figures 5 and 6 which show such a piece 20 having a pair of recesses 21 and a pair of projections 22. It will be apparent that the recesses 21 and the projections 22 are inter engagable with adjacent projections and recesses respectively of a similar piece 20. In this case, each piece is a component of a jig saw puzzle. Instead of providing a single peg 4 on each piece 3, two or more pins may be present on each piece 3. In that event, and with reference to Figure 7, instead of providing a single hole between two lines of latitude 7 and two lines of longitude 8 as in Figure 1, there is provided holes 50 which are positioned in a particular pattern thereon so that only one piece can be placed in the selected position.Thus, for example, the location 51 has two holes in diagonal relationship while the adjacent location 52 has three holes in a different pattern. By appropriately assigning a selected hole pattern to each location and a selected pin pattern to each piece, there will be a specific piece for a specific location on the sphere 1 and the pieces will not fit in any other location. It will be appreciated that any pattern may be depicted on the pieces 3. Furthermore, the pieces 3 may be removed from the sphere 1 to enable the reassembly of the pieces on the sphere. To manufacture each of the pieces 3, a two piece die is used. Reference should be made to Figures 8 10 which show the two piece die which comprises a first part 30 and a second part 31. The first part 30 comprises a hemispherical shell 32 having internal radially projecting elements 33, and a tube 40. The second part 31 comprises a hemisphere 34 having a plurality of holes or dimples 35 therein. The first part 30 is designed to fit over the second part 31. To use the die, the first part 30 is lowered onto the second part 31. The arrangement of each of the dimples 35 is such as to be located in the centre of each of the spaces 38 bordered by part of the elements 33 as best seen inFigure 10. Furthermore, the elements 33 do not contact the surface of the hemisphere 34. The upper part 30 and the lower part 31 are appropriately sealed at 37 and a plastics material is injected between the parts 30, 31 via the tube 40. The plastics material rapidly fills each of the spaces 38, the passage of the plastics material being assisted by virtue of the absence of contact between the elements 33 and the surface of the hemisphere 34.When the plastics material has set, the first part 30 is lifted clear and if required a printing die having the same shape as the first part 30 is pressed onto the surface of the plastics material to print an appropriate pattern thereon such as the outline of the northern hemisphere of the earth. Such printing techniques will be well known to those skilled in the art. Following printing, the plastics material may be removed from the second part 31. Because the plastics material formed under each of the elements 33 is relatively thin, the plastics material may easily be broken up into the pieces 3 of Figures 3 and 4. Furthermore, the dimples 35 provide the pegs 4. It will be appreciated that the pieces of the other hemisphere of the sphere may be made in a manner similar to that described above. Furthermore, it will be appreciated that by providing an appropriate shape to the elements 33, the pieces of Figures 5 and 6 having the recesses 21 and the projections 22 thereon may be made in a similar manner to that described above.
