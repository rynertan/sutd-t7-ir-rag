# Method and apparatus for proven demand air conditioning control.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for proving a demand for air conditioning or heating upon startup of an air conditioning unit before the unit is allowed to effect heat transfer. A separate thermal sensing unit is provided in the return air to prove a demand for cooling prior to the conventional thermostat of the unit being energized to operate the unit in the normal manner. This method and apparatus prevents energy waste and unnecessary cycling at startup and low load conditions.
