# METHOD AND ARRANGEMENT FOR FLUSH FITTING OF WINDOWS

## Abstract
The method of applying a glass flushly to a flanged window aperture comprises the steps of attaching resilient fixing clips 10 , which have means 11 for attachment to the glass 4 and catch means 16 for locating positively on the window aperture flange, at spaced intervals around the periphery of the glass, applying a bead or beads of sealant 8 at least on the outwardly facing surface of the window aperture flange 1 , locating the glass with the fixing clips attached in the window aperture and pressing down on to the sealant bead s , and further pressing the glass home towards the flange until the fixing clips act under the applied pressure and against their resilience so as to deform intermediate sections B thereof sufficiently to permit their catch means to pass through the flange aperture, release of said further pressure permitting the fixing clips, due to their resilience, to restore into their original form and cause the catch means to locate behind said flange and thus positively hold the glass in position within the window aperture and pressed against the sealant. The invention includes within its scope fixing clips suitable for use with the method, and a flush glass system fitted by use of the method and the fixing clips.
