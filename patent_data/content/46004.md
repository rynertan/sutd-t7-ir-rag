# Concentrating zone method in heterogeneous immunoassays.

## Abstract
Method and apparatus are provided for performing immunoassays employing a device comprising a relatively small test zone referred to as an immunosorbing zone 16 , and a relatively large liquid absorbing zone 14,24 in liquid receiving relationship with said immunosorbing zone. The immunosorbing zone includes a member of an immunolo gical pair mip ligand and antiligand bound to a support. A signal producing system is employed in conjunction with said device having as one component a signal label bound to a mip. The signal producing system provides for production of a detectible signal in the immunosorbing zone in relation to the amount of analyte in a sample. The device provides that all fluids employed in the method pass through the immunosorbing zone into the liquid absorbing zone, which acts as a receptacle and driving force for drawing the fluid through the immunosorbing zone.
