## Description
GB A 2 110 689 and GB A 2 113 217 describe herbicidally effective sulfamoyl urea derivatives in which the terminal N of the urea moiety carries a disubstituted triazine group and the terminal N of the sulfamoyl moiety carries a di substituted phenyl group and their herbicidally effective salts. This invention relates to further herbicidally active sulfamoyl urea derivatives, including herbicidal formulations uses thereof to control the growth of noxious plants, i.e., weeds. This invention concerns sulfamoyl urea derivatives represented by the Formula I wherein wherein wherein The Formula I compounds may conveniently be prepared by reacting a suitably substituted amino triazine of the Formula II wherein R¹, R², R³ are as previously defined, with a halosulfonyl isocyanate of the formula OCN SO₂ Hal, wherein Hal is halogen, e.g., chlorine, fluorine or bromine to form the corresponding halosulfonyl urea of the Formula III The Formula III compound is then reacted in the presence of an acid accepting agent with at least a stoichiometric amount of a suitably substituted amine of the Formula IV wherein R⁴ and R⁵ are as previously defined, to form a Formula I compound of the invention. Preferred compounds of the invention are those wherein R³, R⁴ and R⁶ are hydrogen. Preparation of particularly preferred compounds of the invention are illustrated by the following Examples a To a flask was charged 6.0 grams of orthonitroacetophenone, 6.0 grams of trimethylorthoformate 0.25 gram of b To 50 milliliters of methylene chloride maintained at 0 5 C., via an ice bath was added 1.38 grams of 4 methyl 6 methoxy 2 amino 1,3,5 triazine and 1.60 grams of chlorosulfonyl isocyanate. The mixture was stirred at ice temperature for about 3 hours after which a methylene chloride solution containing 1.10 grams of triethylamine and 1.70 grams of the amine prepared in part a of this Example was added. The mixture was permitted to rise to ambient temperature and washed with three portions of ice cold water and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Filtration, followed by evaporation of solvent, afforded a pasty material which was dissolved in 80 milliliters of diethylether. The ether insoluble residue was discarded and the ether was evaporated, affording a resinous solid that was taken up in pentane and filtered. Vacuum drying afforded 1.3 grams of yellow crystalline solid identified by NMR analysis as the desired product, 1 2 1,1 dimethoxyethyl phenylsulfamoyl 3 4 methyl 6 methoxy 1,3,5 triazin 2 yl urea. a To a round bottom flask was charged 10 grams of orthonitroacetophenone, 40 milliliters of ethylene glycol and 0.5 gram of b To 150 milliliters of methylene chloride maintained at 0 5 C. via an ice bath was added 1.41 grams 0.01 mole of 4 methyl 6 methoxy 2 amino 1,3,5 triazine and 1.54 grams of chlorosulfonyl isocyanate. The mixture was stirred at ice temperature until all of the solid had dissolved and for an additional one half hour after which a methylene chloride solution containing 0.01 mole of triethylamine and 0.01 mole of the amine prepared in part a of this Example were added dropwise, the mixture maintained at ice temperature throughout the addition. The mixture was permitted to rise to ambient temperature, recooled in the ice bath and poured into ice cold 2 aqueous hydrochloric acid where it was shaken and rapidly separated. The organic phase was washed with three portions of ice cold water and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Evaporation of solvent afforded a pasty material that crystallized upon addition of a small amount of diethylether. Suction filtration afforded 2.6 grams of material identified by NMR analysis as the desired product, 1 2 1,3 dioxolan 2yl methyl phenylsulfamoyl 3 4 methyl 6 methoxy 1,3,5 triazin 2 yl urea. Although the invention has been illustrated by the foregoing Examples with regard to the preparation of specific compounds within the scope of Formula I, it is to be understood that other compounds within the scope of Formula I may readily be prepared by those skilled in the art simply by varying the choice of starting materials and using the same or similar techniques. Weed control in accordance with this invention is effected by applying to the soil prior to emergence of weeds therefrom or to the plant surfaces subsequent to emergence from the soil, a herbicidally effective amount of a compound of this invention. It is, of course, to be understood that the term a compound of this invention also includes mixtures of such compounds or a formulation containing a compound or mixture of compounds of this invention. The term herbicidally effective amount is amount of a compound of this invention required to so injure or damage weeds such that the weeds are incapable of recovering following application, while not causing any substantial damage to any valuable crop amongst which the weeds might be growing. The quantity of a compound of this invention applied in order to exhibit such satisfactory herbicidal effect may vary over a wide range and depends on a variety of factors, such as, for example, hardiness of a particular weed species, extent of weed infestation, climatic conditions, soil conditions, method of application, and the like. Typically, as little as 113.1 mg m² or less one or less pound per acre of a compound of this invention would be expected to provide satisfactory weed control, although in some instances application rates in excess of 113.1 mg m² one pound per acre e.g., up to 560.4 mg m² or more 5 or more pounds per acre might be required. Of course, the efficacy of a particular compound against a particular weed species may readily be determined by routine laboratory or field testing in a manner well known to the art. It is expected that satisfactory weed control can be had at a rate of application in the range of 1.12 mg m² to 224.2 mg m² 0.01 to 2.0 pounds per acre . Of course, a compound of this invention can be formulated according to routine methods with any of several known and commonly used herbicidal diluents, adjuvants and carriers. The formulations can contain liquid carriers and adjuvants such as organic solvents, as well as emulsifiers, stabilizers, dispersants, suspending agents, spreaders, penetrants, wetting agents and the like. Typical carriers utilized in dry formulations include clay, talc, diatomaceous earth, silica and the like. Preferred formulations are those in the form of wettable powders, flowables, dispersible granulates or aqueous emulsifiable concentrates which can be diluted with water at the site of application. Also, dry formulations such as granules, dusts, and the like, may be used. When desired, a compound of this invention can be applied in combination with other herbicidal agents in an effort to achieve even broader vegetative control. Typical herbicides which can be conveniently combined with Formula I compound include atrazine, hexazinone, metribuzin, ametryn, cyanazine, cyprazine, prometon, prometryn, propazine, simazine, terbutryn, propham, alachlor, acifluorfen, bentazon, metolachlor and N,N dialkyl thiocarbamates such as EPTC, butylate or vernolate. These, as well as other herbicides described, for example, in the The herbicidal formulations contemplated herein can be applied by any of several method known to the art. Generally, the formulation will be surface applied as an aqueous spray. Such application can be carried out by conventional ground equipment, or if desired, the sprays can be aerially applied. Soil incorporation of such surface applied herbicides is accomplished by natural leaching, and is of course facilitated by natural rainfall and melting snow. If desired, however, the herbicides can be incorporated into the soil by conventional tillage means. Compounds of this invention are believed effective for preemergence or postemergence control of a wide variety of broadleaf and grassy weeds. Typical of the various species of vegetative growth that may be controlled, combated, or eliminated are, for example, annuals such as pigweed, lambsquarters, foxtail, crabgrass, wild mustard, field pennycress, ryegrass, goose grass, chickweed, wild oats, velvetleaf, purslane, barnyardgrass, smartweed, knotweed, cocklebur, kochia, medic, ragweed, hemp nettle, spurrey, pondweed, carpetweed, morningglory, ducksalad, cheatgrass, fall panicum, jimsonweed, witchgrass, watergrass, wild turnip, and similar annual grasses and weeds. Biennials that may be controlled include wild barley, campion, burdock, bull thistle, roundleaved mallow, purple star thistle, and the like. Also controlled by the compounds of this invention are perennials such as quackgrass, Johnsongrass, Canada thistle, curly dock, field chickweed, dandelion, Russian knapweed aster, horsetail, ironweed, sesbania, cattail, wintercress, horsenettle, nutsedge, milkweed, sicklepod, and the like. More particularly, by way of example, the compounds prepared in the Examples were each tested for preemergence and postemergence herbicidal activity by spraying a solvent solution of same on a variety of common broadleaf and grassy weed species, under controlled laboratory conditions of light, temperature and humidity. The extent of herbicidal injury was evaluated, periodically after application, and a Numerical Injury Rating NIR assigned on a scale of from 0 no injury to 10 all plants dead . The following Table gives the NIR assigned to each weed specie identified by common name 21 days after preemergence and postemergence application of the compound of Example I at a rate of 56.0 mg m² 0.5 pound per acre The following Table gives the NIR assigned to each weed species identified by common name 22 days after preemergence and postemergence application of the compound of Example II at rates of 56.0 mg m² to 112.1 mg m² 0.5 and 1.0 per acre
