## Description
DESCRIPTION METHOD A 1D APPARATUS GR. UPPLYIitG COATING TO h COTTER The invention relates to a method and apparatus for supplying coating liquid to a paper coater, and zore particularly, to a method and apparatus for supplying excess coating from a remote doctor blade or a coate having a doctor blade to another coater located on the same backing roll. It is already known to to locate two paper coaters on a single backing roll of a papermaking machine, or an off machine coater line. In such an arrangement, each coater has often been provided with separate supply piping connected to a coating supply system comprising, as is conventional, pumps, pump motors, tanks, filters, controls, piping and valving to supply coating liquid to the tso coaters. Any coating not applied to the web by either of the coaters has usually been collected from its respective coater and then returned, via separate piping to the coating supply system for reprocessing and eventual reuse. In such an arrangement, the two coaters were in parallel with respect to the coating supply system.In such parallel arrangement, the coating supply system had to be of sufficient size to meet the cumulative demands of both coaters. It is also known to use a single coater located on a backing roll in conjunction with a remote doctor blade, i.e., a doctor blade located z foot or more behind the coater, om the same backing roll, and to place a one piece, rigid bride no member between the doctor blade and coater to transfer excess coating from the doctor blade directly to resupply the coater. However, such rigid bridge as used in the past could not accommodate movement of the doctor blade to very the angle at which the blade pressed aGainst the backing roll. This shortcoming either limited the operating angle of the doctor blade, or made it necessary to change bridges if blade angle was to be changed.The former adversely affected the paper coating as it is an important parameter in producing good coated paper, and the latter resulted in lost time. One object of the method and apparatus of the present invention is to supply coating to a coater from a doctor blade or another coater with such a blade, while being able to easily adjust the angle of the doctor blade to the backing roll. The method and apparatus of the present invention utilizes apparatus in the form of bridge means which is hinged and adapted to be located between a coater and a remote doctor blade or another coater with such a blade located on the same backing roll. The bridge is positionable between the coater and doctor blade to permit excess coating scraped off by the doctor blade to be collected and transferred or carried over to the coater to be supplied with coating liquid. The use of the hinged bridge permits the relationship of the doctor blade to the backing roll to be varied or adjusted without the need to change or adjust the bridge, the bridge adjus ting automatically to the change of the relative positions of the blade and coater. In the two coater arrangement, with the bridge in use, the two coaters are in series with each other, instead of in parallel so that a substantial reduction in the cost, size and complexity of the coating supply system can be made as it need be large enough only to meet the larger coating demand of the two coaters, instead of the sum of the two demands. For example, if the method and apparatus Orthe present invention were used with two identical coaters, since the coating supply system normally has sufficient excess capacity to provide the amount of coating actually being applied to the web by the two coaters, the coating supply system generally need not be any larger than if it served but a single coater.Whereas if the coaters were as used in the prior art, two coating supply systems or a single system with twice the capacity would have to be provided. If the two coaters are to,be used independently, each coater may be provided with separate coating supply and collecting piping. While this increases the cost and complexity somewhat, the advantage of using a smaller coating supply system is retained, and flexibility of operation is gained. In such installation, the bridge may be positionable in a second position, wherein it will not transfe coating between the coaters and not interfere with the operation of either coater. The invention is described further hereinafter, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a side elevational view of a portion of a papermaking machine backing roll, two different type paper coaters being located on the one roll, and the bridge means of the preSent invention being shown in full lines in a first position, and in dotted lines in a second position Figure 2 is an enlarged cross sectional view of a portion of Figure 1, but with the bridge means shown in dotted lines in the first position and in full lines in the second position Figure 3 is a view similar to Figure 1, but with one of the coaters moved into a position permitting the bridge means to be moved between its first and second positions and Figure 4 is a view similar to Figure 2, but of a second alternative construction for the bridge means. Referring to Figure 1, a backing roll 10 for a papermaking machine is illustrated. It should be understood that the roll 10 could also represent a roll on an off machine paper coater line. As is illustrated, the roll 10 is wrapped at least partially by a paper web 12 which is being coated, the web in this instance moving in the direction of the arrowhead 14.One paper coater 16 is located adjacent the lower right hand quadrant of the roll 10, and another coater 18 is located to the left and downwardly, at the bottom of the roll 10. Of course it is understood that the coaters 16 and 18 could be located elsewhere, and or may be of different types. In this instance, the other coater 18 is of a dip roll type, having a coating pan 20, which contains a rotatably mounted coating application roll 22. The pan has a. front wall not shown and a rear wall 21. The coating pan 20 has baffling in the form of a pair of vertical walls 24 and 26 and an arcuate section 28 which extends from the top of the wall 26 to below the roll 22, and then closes with the bottom 29 of the coating pan. Just to the right of roll. 22 is another internal, vertical wall 30 which forms a rear baffle. The outer walls of the pan extend above the tops of the baffles to contain the coating. If it is desired that the two coaters 16 and 18 be operable separately, a coating supply pipe 32 may be provided to supply coating to the coater 18 from the coating supply system previously described but not shown . The pipe 32 extends through the bottom 29 of the pan 20. Excess coating may be withdrawn from the pan 34 located between baffles 24 and 26 and pipe 36 located behind the baffle wall 30.The pipe 36 has a valve 35 for regulating the rate coating flows from the pan through that pipe. While the coater 18 could be provided with a doctor blade, in this instance, it is not, but when operated alone or with the one coater 16, utilises a doctor blade 37 Figures 1 and 3 carried by the first coater 16, the blade 37 being remote to the coater 18, The coater 16, which is only partially shown, when being utilized, may be supplied with coating from the coating supply system not shown by a piping system not shown to the upper or head portion 38 of the coater.When in operation, of the total coating supplied to the one coater 16, only a small portion, say 10 or less, is actually applied to the web 12, and the greater portion, say 90 or more, ,overflows the front wall 42 of the head portion 38. The head portion 38 of the one coater 16 is pivotally mounted by means not shown to pivot about a point to the right and below the portion as shown in Figure 1, so that it can be moved toward or away from the roll 10 and angularly for among other reasons to vary the angle of the blade 37 to the roll. The one coater 16 is equipped with an overflow pan 44 which has a front wall 46, a rear wall 48 and a bottom wall 50. The pan 44 is of a sweated construction, ioe. the walls 46, 48 and 50 are double walls, so that a fluid, such as cold water, may be circulated between the double walls of the pan to cause condensation of moisture, and prevent coating from accumulating on the same. Likewise, the overflow pan 44 is pivotally mounted by separate means only partially shown to pivot about a point generally to the right of the pan 44 at just below the level of coater portion 38, so it too can pivot toward or away from the roll 10 and also pivot toward or away fron the head portion 38 of the one coater 16, as will be more fully described. N N As shown in Figures 1 to 3, the one coater 16 has been provided with a first embodiment of bridge means 60. The bridge means is shown in a first operating position designated by the letter A full lines inFigure 1 and dotted lines in Figure 2 and in a second stored position, designated by the letter 3 dotted lines in Figure 1 and full lines in Figure 2 . Of course, the bridge means, could instead have been provided or mounted on the other coater 18 or other portions of the papermaking machine. A more detailed view of the bridge means 60 is shown in Figure 2. The bridge means includes a round bar or portion 62 which is engaged by portions of an elongate member 64 and a bracket 66 to pivotally or hingedly mount the. bar 62, and in turn the bridge means 60, to the head 38 of the coater 16. The elongate member 64 is secured to the portion 38 of the coater 16 by conventional means not shown , has a V cut for engaging the round bar 62, and functions to transfer the coating flowing over wall 42 onto the pan portion 68 described below. The bracket 66 is retained by bolts 67 and has a semi circular cutout 69 for engaging the bar 62.The 7 cut 65 and cutout 69 circumscribe greater than 1800, and in this instance approximately 2500, of the bar 62 to retain it in place, but yet not interfere with the desired movement of the bridge. The construction of bridge 60 is such that it can be moved or pivoted on its bar portion 62 between its A and B positions, as will be hereinafter described, but yet prevents leakage of coating material at the joint provided by bar 62, member 64 and bracket 66. The bar 62 at its lower left quadrant is secured, as by welding, to a flat pan or bottom 68 having at its sides turned up edges 70. Like the overflow pan 46, the fiat pan portion 68 is of double wall construction, having a second wall 72 closed by a pair of end walls 74. One of the end walls 74 has an inlet opening 76, while the other not shown has an outlet not shown , to accommodate the flow of cold water for condensing moisture and preventing an accumulation or build up of coating on the bridge. The inlet and outlet are connected by hoses to permit movement of the bridge 60. The wall 72 abuts a projection 77 on the head portion 38 to support the bridge 60 in its stored B position. As shots in Figure 1, the bridge 60 is long enough to extend from Just below the front wall 42 of head portion 38 of the one coater 16 downwardly, beyond and over the upper edge of the rear wall 2 1 of the pan 20 of the other coater 18. Of course, the length and width of the bridge can be varied for the particular installation. Referring to Figure 3, in order to move the bridge 60 between the positions A and 3, the one coater 16 is moved away from the backing roll 10 and the overflow pan 44 of the one coater is also lowered. When moved suffic ient distances, it is possible to then pivot the bridge 60 so that it will clear the upper edge of the rear wall 21 of pan 20 and the upper edge of the front wall 46 of the overflow pan 44. After the bridge 60 is placed in the desired position by means not shown , such as manually, pneumatically, electrically or hydraulically, the head portion 38 and overflow pan 44 of the coater 16 may be returned to their original positions. While not necessary, if desired, the overflow pan 44 can be raised to the position shown in Figure 1, to support the bridge.Also, it is possible to use only the coater 16 with the coater 18 lowered from the backing roll 10. In such configuration, the bridge may be stored inside the overflow pan 44, and the overflow pan 44 raised close to the roll, e.g. 6 mm from the roll . In such configuration, the distance or gap between the top edge of the overflow pan and backing roll can be varied by moving or pivoting the overflow pan toward or away from the roll 10 to control coating flow. Referring to Figure 4, a second bridge embodiment 8C is shown. The portions of bridge 80 which are similar to bridge 60 and portions of the coater 16 and the surrounding environment which are similar, are identified by the same reference numbers as used previously. Bridge 80 is similar to bridge 60, but instead of a pivot pin type hinge connection provided by rod 62, bridge 80 utilizes a flexible hinge 82, One end 84 of the flexible hinge 82 is secured or bonded to an extenson 86 on the one coater, the extension 86 corresponding to the member 64. The other end 88 of the flexible hinge S2 is secured or bonded to the flat pan or bottom 90 of the bridge 80. The material for the flexible hinge should be selected to be compatible with the coatings to be used and for long life. For aqueous clay coating, neoprene or butyal rubber is a suitable material. In all other respects, and in its operation, the bridge 80 is similar to the bridge 60. As the operation of bridge 80 is similar to that for bridge 60, only operation of bridge 60 will be described. then the bridge 60 is in position B, it is stored in the overflow pan 44 of the one coater 16 and does not intefere with the flow of excess coating scraped off the web 12 by the doctor blade 37 into that pan. In the B position, either the one coater 16 or the other coater 18 in conjunction with remote blade 37 can be used independently, the provision of the bridge in no manner interf erring with the operation of the coaters. With the bridge in position A so that it is between the one coater 16 and the other coater 18, coating can flow from the coating supply system to coater 16 and then over the bridge to coater 18. While some of the coating would be applied to the web 12 by the one coater 16, most would overflow the front wall 42 of the one coater. From there it is intercepted by the bridge 60 and is carried downwardly by gravity across the bridge to the other coater 18 to supply the same with coating liquid. Again, some of the coating is applied to the web 12, while the excess coating from the second coater 18 is withdrawn from pan 20, returned to the coating supply system, reprocessed and then may be returned to the one coater 16. Of course, the installation shoam in Figures 1 to 3 permits either coater 16 or 18 to be used independently.In such instances coating need be supplied only to the coater being used. If coater 18 is being used alone, it could be supplied with coating through pipe 32 or the supply for coater 16. In the latter instance, the coating would then flow across the bridge to coater 18. Altern atively, coater 18 could be supplied with coating from both sources. If coater 16 is being used alone, coater 18 can be lowered from. the backing roll 10. The bridge 60 would be stored in the overflow pan 44, and only coater 16 is supplied with coating. Of course, when both coaters are being used, the coating can be supplied directly to coater 16 or 18 or both as desired. Further, as the bridge 60 is pivotably or hingedly connected, it can readily accommodate movement of the head portion 38 to vary the angle the doctor blade 37 makes with the backing roll and web so that this insort ant parameter can be easily varied. Thus, adjustments in blade angle can be readily made without stopping the papermaking machine and or changing bridges. As is apparent, the present invention greatly reduces the size and capacity of the required coating supply system. In fact, in an installation where both coaters are to always be run simultaneously, the overflow pan 44 for the one coater 16 and separate supply piping 32 for the other coater 18 can also be completely eliminated. For purposes of simplicity, the invention has been described only in conjunction with two coaters. However, i t should be understood that it is just as applicable to a single coater and a remote doctor blade located on the same backing roll above the coater. In such installation coating would be supplied to the coater from the coating supply system, applied to the web, the excess scraped off by the remote doctor blade, transferred to the bridge, and by gravity returned to the pan of the coater. Also, the pan could be equipped with some means for withdrawing some of the coating from the pan for reprocessing by the coating supply system and then returned to the pan. The hinged bridge means would have one end fixed, preferably to portions carrying the remote doctor blade. Thus, the remote doctor blades position relative to the backing roll or web could be adjusted, and the hinged bridge means would automatically compensate for the change.
