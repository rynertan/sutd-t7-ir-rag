# Semiconductor device comprising EAROM cells.

## Abstract
A semiconductor device 30 comprising electrically alterable read only memories 20 formed in and on the same silicon substrate 31 is dis closed. A bipolar voltage generator is formed on the same silicon substrate 31 in a block 32 II electrically isolated from the block 32 I containing the read only memories, so that voltages of either polarity may be obtained selec tively to control the gates of the read only memories using only a unipolar external voltage source V via lines L1, L2 . The gate control voltage, supplied along line L3, may be a high voltage for erasing memory, a lower voltage of the same polarity for reading memory, or a high voltage of the opposite polarity for writing memory.
