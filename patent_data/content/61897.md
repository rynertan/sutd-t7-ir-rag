# Method and apparatus for converting the internal energy of a fluid into mechanical energy capable of producing work.

## Abstract
A fluid is liquified at a temperature and pressure below its critical temperature and then introduced into a chamber 4 provided with means 6, 7 for transmitting heat thereto. On transmitting heat to the liquified fluid, its temperature rises above said critical temperature and the fluid is con verted to the gaseous state with consequential expansion. This expansion causes rapid displacement of an elastic diaphragm 5 disposed in the chamber, the diaphragm displacement causing movement of hydraulic fluid capable of displacing a mechanical element coupled thereto such as a plunger in a cylinder, thereby converting the interal energy of the fluid into mechanical work. Carbonic anhydride is a particularly suitable fluid to use. The gaseous fluid is thereafter discharged from the chamber and condensed to return it to its initial state of volume, temperature and pressure ready to be used again. The energy for this discharge and liquification could be provided from a second adjacent apparatus interactively associated with the first apparatus.
