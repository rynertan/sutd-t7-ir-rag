A preferred pH range for 2 1 solution in water is from about 6 to about 11.Physical Characteristics of the Detergent Composition The liquid detergent compositions of the invention contain abrasives as suspended solids and may contain other solid or liquid ingredients that provide desired product stability characteristics and that affect product viscosity. In general, the products of the invention are thixotropic or pseudoplastic and resistant to settling out of the abrasive or other solids yet sufficiently fluid for dispensing with the package of the invention In general, the compositions have a Brookfield viscosity of from about 400 cps to about 2500 cps when measured at 50 rpm and a yield value of from about 5 to about 600 dynes per square centimeter at 25 C The important physical property consideration o the compositions of the invention is their yield value. The consistency of simple or Newtonian liquids is a function of the nature of the material, tcmperature, and pressure only. This consistency is known as the fluid viscosity coefficient. absolute viscosity, or merely viscosity, and is usually measured in centipoises 1 centipoise 0.01 gram centimeter second . With a Newtoian liquid, any force applied to the system produces some defomation, according to the formula du dr r where du dr the rate of shear F the shear stress, or shearing force per unit area and p the viscosity coeeficient. In the case of non Newtonian liquids, on the o er hand, the consistency is a function of the material, pressure, temperature, and also the shear stress applied to the system.Those non Newtonian liquids which are classified as Bingham plastics, or real plastics, are not always deformed when a force is applied to the system Deformation, if any, takes place according to the formula du dr f where the apparent viscosity, or plastic viscosity, at the shear stress F J a characteristic of the liquid called th yield stress, or yield value, measured in units of pressure and du dr and F are as defined above. If te shear stress applied to the system is less than the yield value, the system will not be deformed at all. Hence a Bingham plastic system is capable of supporting indefinitely insoluble particulate material which has a density rjreater than that 0 . the supporting metium so long as the material has such a particle size and density that the sear stress which each particle places on the supporting medium does not exceed the yield value. This is to be contrasted with suspension of heavy insoluble particulate material in Newtonian liquids with high viscosities. In highly viscous Newtonian liquids, insoluble particulate material is suspended only because the rate of flow is slow. In Bingham plastics, insoluble par ticulate material is suspended because the stress imposed by the particles does not exceed the yield value of the liquid, and therefore, there is no flow at all. Of course, if the yield value of the supporting medium should sufficiently decrease for any reason, the particies would not longer be suspended. This could be caused, for example, by a physical or chemical change in the supporting medium. If one of the componennts of the supporting medium is an emulsion which settles into layers upon standing, the yield value can be lost temporarily, but in such a case, the original composition can be reconstituted by mixing. If a chemical reaction either consumes a vital component or produces a damaging one, the loss of yield value can be penrianent. Because it is usually not known whether a system behaves in a truly plastic manner at low shear rates, the measurement of exact yield values is estimated, in dynes per square centimeter, by the following relationship Yield alue Viscosity at 0.5 r.p.m. Viscosity at 1 r.p.m. 100This relationship represents an extrapolation of the sheer curve to G r.p.m. since an absolute shear stress cannot be measured at 0 r.p.m. The yield value of the liquid detergent compositions of this invention ranges from about 5 to about 600 dynes per square centimeter. If the yield value is too lo, the insoluble, particulate material will not be suspended, because the weight of the individual particles, distributed over the area which supports the particles, will exceed the yield value. However, if the yield value is too great, th2 composition will become thick and unmanageable because as the yield value increases, so will the apparent viscosity. A preferred range of yield values to support the insoluble particulate material used in the liquid detergent compositions of this invention is from about 100 to about 1jOO dynes pe square centimeter. The physical characteristics of the compositions can present a dispensing problem because of a slow drain back characteristic that leads to product retention and subsequent clogging in various parts of a dispensing closure.This difficulty is greatly intensified hen the closure is not sealed after use and water and other solvents evaporate from the product retained in the closure.The Clog Resistant Package As discussed hereinbefore the essential package elements are 1 a flexible package container to provide the squeeze dispensing characteristics typical of a variety of consumer products including dishwashing liquids and liquid abrasive cleansers and 2 a clog resistant closure, Typical dishwashing liquid detergents have a viscosity within the range of from 30 cps to 300 cps, contain no suspended solids other than low levels of opacifiers and are not thixotropic or psuedoplastic to any great etent. Closure clogging is not a serious problem and directional control of dispensed product is of no particular concern. As disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patents 3,981,421 and 4,065,037, incorporated herein by reference, the design of closures for abrasive liquid cleaning preparations involve consideration of the thixotropic nature of such products because of product retention in the closure per ture. In the package of the present invention, the closure design is distinguished by elements particularly suited to the dispensing of the product of the invention. The design elements of particular importance are 1 the absence of internal mechanisms or other obstructions to product flow in the closure up to the aperture 2 a domed nozzle portion with a horizontal inner diameter of at least about 0.2 inches 3 an aperture through the domed nozzle portion with a horizontal cross sectional area of from about 0.002 in2 to about 0.025 in2 a minimum diameter of about 0.05 in and a length through the dome wall of no more than about 0.25 in. The domed or hemispherical nozzle design with its absence of acute angles, i.e. comers does not allow any appreciable product buildup and has the beneficial effect of concentrating and focusing any compressive force applied to the flexible container in a manner to keep the nozzle region and aperture clear of product buildup. The release of pressure J rom the container alter dispensing clears the aperture.Brief Description of the Drawinçs Figure 1 is a top plan view of an example of the closure of th2 Invention. Figure 2 is a cross sectional view taken along the line 2 2 of Figure 1. Figure 3 is a partial section, taken along the line 3 3 of Figure 1.Description of Preferred Package.Embodiments Ali example of the dispensing closure of the present invention is illustrated in Figures 1 through 3 wherein like parts are identified by.the 5TC number. The closure is generally indicated at 1 having a body portion 2 and a bail like sealing member 3. The body portion 2 has a downwardly depending annular portion or skirt 4. The inside surface of the annular portion t is provided with threads 5 adapted to mate and engage corresponding threads on the neck or finish of a container not shown .Means other than threading as are well known in the art may be employed to engage the closure 1 with the neck or finish of a container within the scope of the present invention. The outside surface of the annular portion 4 can, if desired, be provided with grooves, ridges or the like both for decorative purposes and to facilitate grasping of the shell for threading it onto the container finish. The interior surface of the top portion of the body portion 2 can have a downwardly depending annual rib 6 to but and form a seal with the top surface of the container finish. A chimney 7 is located centrally of the top portion of the body portion 2. The chimney is generally cylindrical in configuration and is provided with an axial bore 8, open at its lower end to communicate with the interior of the container and is surmounted at its upper end with a domed or hemispherical portion 9 terminating in an aperture 10 for dispensing the product from the container and closure. The diameter of the axial boie 8 also d2fines the interior 3lorizontal diameter of the domed portion which preferably is at least about 0.2 inches.The blil like sealing member 3 has an arcuate conformation and rotatable joints 11, 12 with the top portion of the closure body portion 2. In other embodiments, the joint is located on the outside wall of the chimney by means, for example, of protuberant posts from the chimney engaging sockets on the sealing member. The sealing member 3 has a gripping portion 13 centrally located and a downwardly projecting protrusion 14 adapted to plug the aperture 10 when the sealing member 3 is in an closed position The sealing member may be adapted to provide a more positive seal of the protrusion 14 with the aperture 10 during shipmen, than is desirable during the period of consumer use.By way of example, the posts 15, 16 can be engaged into sockets 17, 18 for shipment and sale. Although the materials used for the dispensing package portion of the invention can be any ri aterials that met the stated qualifications, conventional plastic material are generally satisfactory. The container may be made of such materials as polyethylene, polypropylene or polyvinyl chloride. Particularly suitable are materials capable of formation into containers by blow molding. The parts of the closure can be made from plastic materials such as polyethylene, polystyrene, polycarbonates or polypropylene that can be formed into desired shapes by injection molding. materials resistent to cold flow such as the polycarbonates are particularly suitable for the sealing member The following examples are given to illustrate the detergent compositions of the invention. All amounts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated.

Equivalent results are obtained when C12 alkyldiethanol amide and the reaction product of a C12 15 alcohol and 8 moles of ethylene oxide are substituted for the C12 all monoethanol amide of Composition E. Equivalent results are obtained when sodium C12 13 alkylbenzene sulfonate and C12 15 paraffin sulfonate are substituted for the sodium C12 13 alkyl sulfate of composi tions A, B, C, D and E. Compositions A. and B were stored in packages of the invention with a closure having a circular cross section aperture with a diameter of 0.12 inches. Product was dispensed from 22 fl. oz. containers as packed and after storage of 3, s, 10, 17 and 30 days. When the aperture has covered between uses, there was essentially no evidence of clogging to restrict or misdirect product flow when the container was subjected to a pressure of 6 lbs. applied 4 inches from the base of the container. When the aperture was left open between uses, performance was impaired but generally satisfactory. Control samples utilizing the push pull liquid detergent closure of U.S. Patents 3,227,332 and 3,201,013 and the liquid abrasive cleanser closures of U.S. Patents 3,981,421 and 4,065,037 did not provide dispensing characteristics as satisfactory. Equivalent results are obtained when sodium C12 13 alkyl benzene sulfonate is substituted for the sodium C12 13 alkyl sulfate of con positions A, B, C, D and E.
