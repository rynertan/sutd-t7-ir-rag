# THICKENED, WATER BASED HYDRAULIC FLUID WITH REDUCED DEPENDENCE OF VISCOSITY ON TEMPERATURE

## Abstract
Improved hydraulic fluids or metalworking lubricants, utilizing mixtures of water, metal lubricants, metal corrosion inhibitors, and an associative polyether thickener, have reduced dependence of the viscosity on temperature achieved by the incorporation therein of an ethoxylated polyether surfactant.
