# Electrostatic system analyzer.

## Abstract
An electrostatic system analyser 21 for checking the voltage at various test points in a high voltage eletrostatic spray coating system. The analyser includes an elongated analyser body housing 22 several elongated high voltage resistors making up a high resistance path. One end of the high resistance path is coupled to an ammeter 24 mounted at a proximal end of the analyser body, and the other end of the resistance path is coupled to an electrode 26 mounted on a fitting 27 at the distal end of the analyser body. The fitting 27 is rotatably mounted on the analyser body 22 and is generally L shaped to position the electrode to be laterally offset from the distal end of the analyser body. This positioning of the electrode 26 facilitates viewing the electrode when it is placed at test points in the electrostatic coating system. The ammeter 24 has a meter face 36 which includes a different scale 37, 38, 39 related to each test point, with the scales being offset from one another to compensate for resistance differences between the test points.
