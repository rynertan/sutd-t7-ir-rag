# Sensor for components of a liquid mixture.

## Abstract
A sensor electrode to detect one or more components in a liquid mixture comprises an electrically conductive material hav ing at least at an external surface, the combination of an enzyme catalytic for a reaction of the desired component, and a mediator compound which transfers electrons from the enzyme to the electrode when such catalytic activity takes place. It can be used as an in vivo glucose sensor either with a silver electrode coated with e. g. glucose oxidase and a polyviologen as the mediator, or with a particulate carbon electrode, glucose oxidase and chloranil or fluoranil as mediator. Another system is to use bacterial glucose dehydrogenase or glucose oxidase as the enzyme and or ferrocene or a ferrocene derivative as the mediator compound to give electrodes with improved linearity, speed of response and insensitivity to oxygen.
