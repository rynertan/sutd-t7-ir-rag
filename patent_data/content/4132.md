## Description
Esters of ss Lactam antibiotics, a process for their preparation and their use in pharmaceutical compositions British Patent Application No. 9366 77 32836 77 see also Belgian Patent No. 864570 disclosed inter alia that the compounds of the formula I IV EMI1.1 EMI2.1 and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are useful antibacterial compounds. It has now been found that certain esters of such compounds have favoured antibacterial activity that allows them to be used in the treatment of infections due to gram positive and gramnegative bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus andProteus mirabilis. The present invention provides the compounds of the formulae V X EMI2.2 EMI2.3 EMI3.1 wherein R is a group of the sub formula a , b or c CHR1 O CO R2 a CHRl O Co OR2 b EMI4.1 where R1 is a hydrogen atom or a methyl or ethyl group R2 is a lower alkyl, lower alkylaryl or aryl group and R3 is a CHR4 CHR4 or CR5 CR5 group where R4 is a hydrogen atom or a methyl group and R5 is a hydrogen atom, a methyl group or R4 and R5 together with the carbon atoms to which they are attached form the residue of a phenyl group or of a phenyl group substituted by one or two lower alkyl or lower alkoxyl groups of fluorine, chlorine or bromine atoms and R1 is a lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl or aralkyl group. When used herein the term lower means a group of up to 4 carbon atoms. When used herein the term aryl means phenyl or phenyl substituted by one or two lower alkyl or lower alkoxyl groups or fluorine, chlorine or bromine atoms. When used herein the term aralkyl means a lower alkyl group substituted by a phenyl group or by a phenyl group substituted by a nitro, lower alkyl or lower alkoxyl group or by a fluorine, chlorine or bromine atom. More suitably R1 is a hydrogen atom or a methyl group. Most suitably R3 represents the residue of a phenyl ring. Values of R particularly worthy of mention are acetoxymethyl, pivaloyloxymethyl, a ethoxycarbonyloxyethyl and phthalidyl. A preferred value for R is phthalidyl. Values of R particularly worthy of mention are the benzyl and substituted benzyl groups. Other suitable values for R include the methyl, ethyl, propyl, allyl, propargyl and phenylethyl groups. A preferred value for R is the p nitrobenzyl group. Preferred compounds of this invention are esters of the cis compounds of the formulae I and III . The esters of this invention may be used to treat bacterial infections. Thus in a further aspect this invention provides a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a compound of this invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Most suitably, the compositions of this invention are used to treat infections due to gram positive organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus. The compositions of this invention will generally contain from 50mg to 500mg of a compound of this invention and may be administered once or more times a day so that the total daily dose for a 70kg adult is in the range 200mg to 2000mg. The compositions of this invention may be administered orally or parenterally. The compositions of this invention may also be formulated for intra mammary administration to cattle for the treatment of mastitis. The compositions of this invention may be formulated in conventional manner, for example as for amoxycillin, thienamycin or the like. Those compounds of this invention having these cisconfiguration about the ss lactam are preferred since they tend to possess more potent antibacterial activity than the corresponding trans compound as judged by in vitro methods . The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of a compound of this invention which comprises the reaction of a salt of a compound of the formula I , II , III or IV with a compound of the formula XI , XII , XIII or XIV Y CHRl O CO R2 XI Y CHRl O CO OR2 XII EMI6.1 Y R1 XIV wherein R1, R2 and R3 are as defined in relation to subformulae a , b and c , RÚ is as defined in relation to formulae IX and X and Y is a group readily displaceable by a nucleophile. Most suitably the salt employed is an alkali metal salt such as the sodium salt. Most suitably Y is a chlorine, bromine or iodine atom. The esterification reaction is normally performed in a polar organic solvent such as dimethylformamide or its equivalent. Generally the reaction is performed at a non extreme temperature such as 0 60 C and may conveniently be carried out at ambient temperature. The desired ester may be purified chromatographically if desired. The compounds of this invention are not overtly toxic at the therapeutic dose. The following examples illustrate the invention Example 1Pthalidyl 5R,65 3 E 2 acetamidoethenylthio 6 S 1hydroxy ethyl 7 oxo 1 azabicyclo 3.2.0 hept 2 ene 2 carboxylateEMI7.1 The sodium salt e2 0.312g of material approximately 70 pure was stirred with bromophthalide 0.199g in dimethylformamide 6ml at room temperature for 1.5 hours.
