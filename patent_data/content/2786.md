# Retaining ring.

## Abstract
A retaining ring structure is adapted to be located in a circumferential groove 22 in a first member and to engage a second member to restrain relative axial movement of said members under thrust loading. The retaining ring structure includes a ring 36 portion of L shaped cross section having a leg portion 40 and a foot portion 52 . The free end of the leg portion 40 fits into the groove 22 and the foot portion 52 engages a surface of the member adjacent the groove. A surface of the leg portion is adapted to contact the side wall 26 of the groove 22 and is undercut so as to avoid contact with the edge of the groove. One specific retaining ring structure includes a pair of sector ring portions 36, 38 in nested relation with the outer apex of the L shape of one of the sector ring portions located at the inner apex of the L shape of the other sector ring portion.
