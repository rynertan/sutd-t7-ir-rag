## Description
The present invention relates to a novel composition comprising a penem or carbapenem antibiotic in association with an amino acid derivative. The invention also provides these compounds for treating bacterial infections by administering them to the patient, simultaneously or sequentially. The class of compounds known as penem and carbapenem antibiotics is, of course, very well known and is potentially of great value for the treatment of bacterial infections. Although, as a group, these penem and carbapenem antibiotics exhibit excellent anti bacterial activity and a variety of other properties which render them highly suitable for pharmaceutical use, they do have a number of disadvantages. One of the problems of these antibiotics is that, in general, they exhibit a degree of renal toxicity, and some degree of kidney damage is a frequent side effect of their use accordingly, such penem and carbapenem antibiotics should not be used for the treatment of patients with actual or suspected impaired renal function. As a result, the penem and carbapenem antibiotics cannot be used for many patients for whom otherwise they would be the antibiotic of choice. The problem of renal toxicity is particularly acute when the antibiotics are administered by intravenous or intramuscular injection in a high dose. We have now surprisingly found that the concurrent, or effectively concurrent, administration, with the penem or carbapenem antibiotic, of one or more of a certain limited class of acylated amino acid derivatives significantly reduces this renal toxicity. Accordingly, in one aspect, the present invention provides a composition comprising a an antibiotic which is a penem antibiotic or a carbapenem antibiotic and b a pharmaceutically acceptable In another aspect, the invention provides the use of The invention also provides a two part pharmaceutical preparation comprising, in one part, a and, in the other part, b . There is no particular limitation on the nature of the penem or carbapenem antibiotic to which the present invention can be applied and it is believed that the beneficial effects of the concurrent or effectively concurrent administration of an acylated amino acid derivative will be achieved regardless of the particular antibiotic chosen. However, the antibiotics which are currently of most actual or potential interest may be represented by the general formula I in which The invention may also be applied to pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters of such antibiotics. Specific examples of compounds of general formula I which may be employed in the present invention are those in which R¹ and X are as defined below. The penem and carbapenem compounds are hereinafter, where appropriate, identified by the numbers assigned to them in this list. Of the compounds listed above, we particularly prefer those which have the same configuration as thienamycin, i.e. 5 In the above formulae, Ph represents the phenyl group. R² and R³ are the same or different and each represents a hydrogen atom or a carboxylic acyl group as defined, provided that R² and R³ are not simultaneously hydrogen atoms. R⁴ represents a carboxylic acyl group. Examples of carboxylic acyl groups which may be represented by R², R³ and R⁴ include Of the groups exemplified above, the following are preferred acetyl, benzoyl, cyclohexanecarbonyl, cyclopropanecarbonyl, hexanoyl, isobutyryl, crotonoyl, ethoxycarbonyl, 4 hydroxybenzoyl, anisoyl, 4 aminobenzoyl, naphthoyl, toluoyl, benzyloxycarbonyl and 4 methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl groups, of which the acetyl and benzoyl, particularly benzoyl, groups are most preferred. Specific examples of the amino acid compounds which may be employed in the present invention are given in the following list. It should, of course, be appreciated that these compounds can exist in the Of the amino acid derivatives listed above, the following are particularly preferred Compounds No. 27, 29, 37, 38, 82, 84, 95, 96, 115, 117, 129, 144, 160 and 176. The amino acid derivatives employed in the present invention are acids and, as such, are capable of forming salts any pharmaceutically acceptable salt of these amino acids may be employed. Examples of such salts include alkali metal salts such as the sodium or potassium salts alkaline earth metal salts, such as the calcium salt other metal salts, such as the magnesium, aluminium, iron, zinc, copper, nickel and cobalt salts the ammonium salt and salts with amino sugars, such as glucosamine and galactosamine. The compositions of the invention may be prepared by any suitable method which involves mixing the antibiotic with the amino acid derivative and the invention is not intended to be limited by any particular method of preparation. Since the amino acid derivatives employed in this invention have, in general, very limited solubility in water, it is preferred that they should first be dispersed in water and then converted to a suitable salt by adding an aqueous solution of an appropriate base, for example a metal compound, such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide ammonia or an amino sugar, such as glucosamine or galactosamine. Sufficient of the base is added to adjust the pH of the mixture to a value within the range from 6 to 9. The penem or carbapenem antibiotic is then added to the resulting solution. The mixed solution thus obtained may be employed as such or it may first be lyophilized to give a powdery mixture, which may be subsequently formulated into an appropriate dosage form suitable for the chosen route of administration, either by the manufacturer or prior to use. Although it is convenient to administer the antibiotic and the amino acid derivative simultaneously to a patient in a single composition, it is, of course, clear that the two compounds may be administered separately, provided that they are administered sufficiently closely in time to each other that the amino acid derivative has a suitable concentration in the blood for all or most of the time that the antibiotic is present. Normally, it is anticipated that this will be achieved if the two compounds are administered within one hour of each other. The composition of the invention is particularly suitable for use by intravenous administration. There is no particular restriction on the relative proportions of the amino acid derivative and the penem or carbapenem antibiotic in general, we have found that proportions of amino acid derivative to antibiotic of from 0.1 1 to 4 1 give good results, but equally proportions outside this range may successfully be employed. The invention is further illustrated by the following Examples and Activity Tests. In the following, the penem or carbapenem antibiotics are referred to by the numbers appended to them in the foregoing list and are identified as Penem Cpd No. whilst the amino acid derivatives are also identified by the numbers appended to them in the foregoing list and are referred to as Amino Acid Cpd No. 5 g of Similar procedures to those described in Example 1 were carried out, using the other penem or carbapenem antibiotic substances and the other ornithine, lysine phenylglycine or phenylalanine derivatives shown in the following Table, in the amounts shown in that Table. In this Table, where the amino acid derivatives are not specified as being The preparation obtained by the procedure described in Example 1 was injected into the ear vein of a rabbit about 3 kg body weight in an amount of 3 ml kg that is 150 mg kg of the penem Compound No. 6 150 mg kg of After one week, the kidneys of both rabbits were excised and examined. A change was observed in the renal tissue of the rabbits to which had been administered the preparation without the Similar experiments were carried out on other preparations which were prepared from other penem or carbapenem antibiotic substances and other amino acid derivatives. The Table also shows the results of these experiments. The observed change in the renal tissue of the control rabbits was a degenerative necrosis of the proximal renal tubules in the region of the renal cortex. In the following Table, where the proportion of the total area of this region which exhibited such necrosis was from 0 to 25 , this is shown as . Where the area is less than 50 this is shown as and where it is less than 75 this is shown as . Where different animals within each test group exhibited different responses, this is shown as e.g. or . It should be noted that, whenever penem or carbapenem antibiotic substances which were not combined with amino acid derivatives were administered, a change in the renal tissue was observed.
