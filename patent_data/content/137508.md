# Method of and device for the digital cancellation of the echo generated in connections with time varying characteristics.

## Abstract
The method provides the use, for the determination of the equivalent echo channel pulse response, of digital filter ing techniques of the transversal adaptive type, and the subdivision of the pulse response of the equivalent echo channel into three intervals, the second of which consists of the significant portion of the pulse response and is deter mined by the iterative search for the value and the position of the coefficient of maximum absolute value the first interval corresponds, on the contrary, to a pure delay and the third to the contribution given by the lowest frequencies of the base band. To copy the echo signal there are only considered the pulse response coefficients whose index is comprised in the second interval, and the samples of the signal to be copied, belonging to preceding sampling instants, whose index is also comprised in the second interval. A device designed to implement the method is also described.
