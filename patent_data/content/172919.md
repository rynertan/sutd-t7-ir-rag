The cephalosporin derivative or its salt of ester thereof of this invention can be produced according to various methos Reaction Schemes A to E mentioned below, the details of which are explained in the following.Reaction Scheme AEMI17.1 In Reaction SchemeA,a cephalosporin compound of the formula 2 or its salt is made to react with a compound of the formula 3 or its salt. The reaction product, if required, is then subjected to deprotection, salt forming reaction, esterification, or reduction. In the formula 2 , R1 and R2 are as defined in the formula 1 , Q represents an acyloxy group, a carbamoyloxy group, or a halogen atom, p represents 0 or 1, and R6 represents a hydrogen atom or a protective group. Examples of preferred acyloxy groups include acetyloxy, trifluoroacetyloxy, trichloroacetyloxy, propionyloxy, 3 oxobutyryloxy, 3 carboxypropionyloxy, 2 carboxybenzoyloxy, 4 carboxybutyryloxy, mandelyloxy, 2 carboethoxycarbamoyl benzoyloxy, 2 carboethoxysulfamoyl benzoyloxy and 3 ethoxycarbamoylpropionyloxy. Examples of preferred halogen atoms include iodine, bromine and chlorine. Suitable exmples of the protective group in R6 include lower alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, iso propyl, butyl, pentyl and hexyl alkanoyloxyalkyl such as acetoxymethyl, propionyloxymethyl, butyryloxymethyl, valeryloxymethyl and pivaloyloxymethyl alkoxyalkyl such as methoxymethyl, ethoxymethyl, methoxyethyl and ethoxyethyl aralkyl, which may be substituted, such as benzyl, 4 methoxybenzyl, 4 nitrobenzyl, phenetyl, trityl, diphenylmethyl, bis methoxyphenyl methyl and 3,4 dimethoxybenzyl haloalkyl such as 2 iodoethyl and 2,2,2 trichloroethyl alkenyl such as vinyl and allyl aryl which may be substituted such as phenyl,4 chlorophenyl,tolyl, xylyl and mesityl and trialkylsilyl such as trimethylsilyl, triethylsilyl, tert butyldimethylsilyl and tributylsilyl. Of these, R6 is preferably the trialkylsilyl group. In case where R6 is the trialkylsilyl group, the cephalosporin derivative 1 can be obtained in good yield because the production of A2 isomer of the cephalosporin derivative 1 is inhibited. The cephalosporin compound of the formula 2 may be its salt, and suitable examples of the salt include the same salts that are exemplified in the cephalosporin derivatives of the formula 1 , 1 1 , 1 2 and 1 3 . The cephalosporin compound of the formula 2 is a known compound and can be produced by known methods U.S.Patent No.4,298,606, U.S.Patent No.4,406,899, and U.S.Patent No. 4,399,131. In the formula 3 , R3, R4, R5, Q, m, n and X are as defined in the formula 1 . The compound of the formula 3 may be its salt, and suitable salts may include an acid addition salt such as an inorganic acid salt e.g., hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulfate, phosphate, etc. and an organic acid salt e.g., acetate, maleate, tartrate, benzensulfonate, toluenesulfonate, etc. . The compound of the formula 3 is a known compound and can be produced by known methods J. Org. Chem.46, 1737 1738, 1981 Synthesis, 701, September, 1978 . The reaction of a cephalosporin compound of the formula 2 or its salt with a compound of the formula 3 or its salt is effected by allowing them to come into contact with each other in an inert organic solvent. Examples of the inert organic solvent include halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylenechloride, dichloromethane, chloroform, carbontetrachloride and l,2 dichloroethane ethers such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane and dimethoxyethane hydrocarbons such as hexane, benzene, toluene and xylene acetonitrile dimethylformamide diethylacetoamide dimethylsulfoxide and ethylacetate. It is desirable to maintain the reaction temperature at or lower than room temperature, and it is advisable to carry out the reaction at a temperature ranging from 300 to 500C. The reaction of the cephalosporin compound of the formula 2 or its salt with the compound of the formula 3 or its salt is theoretically accomplished in equimolecular quantities however, in the actual reaction the compound of formula 3 or its salt is usually used 0.7 to 10 times, preferably 1.0 to 10 times the molar quantity of the cephalsporin compound of formula 2 or its salt. The reaction can be carried out by simply stirring them together. The reaction time varies depending upon the reaction solvent and reaction temperature, but usually ranges from 5 minutes to 3 hours. The reaction product can be isolated and purified by known methods such as crystallization, chromatography, etc. In case where a syn isomer of the compound 2 or its salt is used as the material compound in the reaction, a syn isomer of the compound 1 or its salt or ester thereof is obtained. When syn and anti isomers of the compound 2 or salt thereof are used, a mixture of syn and anti isomers of the compound 1 is obtained. The mixture can be separated into the respective isomers according to the usual method such as crystallization and chromatography. The reaction product is, if required, subjected to deprotection, salt forming reaction, esterification or reduction. The deprotection is a known reaction per se and a carboxyl protecting group can be released by the hydrolytic cleavages in the presence of acid or base.An aminoprotecting group can be removed by contact with acid or by catalytic reduction U.S.Patent No.4,152,433 Patent No.4,298,606 . The salt forming reaction is also a known reaction per se and the reaction can be effected, for instance, by treating a compound of formula 1 having a betaine structure with an acid such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, acetic acid, and trifluoroacetic acid or otherwise treating betaine with a salt such as sodium chloride, sodium iodine, and potassium chloride in the presence of an acid. The esterification is a known reaction itself and is carried out by allowing a cephalosporin derivative of the formula 1 or its salt to react with alkylhalide, alkanoyloxyalkylhalide or alkoxyalkylhalide, for instance, in an inert organic solvent such as acetone and dimethylformamide United Kingdom Patent No.2,404,921 . The reduction is also a known reaction itself and is accomplished by treating a cephalosporin derivative of the formula 1 wherein p is 1 with acetylchloride or the like and further by reducing with sodium dithionous acid United Kingdom PatentNo.2,40,921 . The following methods may be cited for obtaining the crystalline cephalosporine derivatives of the present invention. There are a method in which an amorphous powder of cephalosporin derivative of formula 1 is firstly dissolved in water, or an organic solvent such as methanol, ethanol, acetone, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, and acetonitrile, or a mixed solvent thereof and then allowing the solution standing awhile until the crystal is formed and precipitated a method in which said amorphous powder is recrystallized by use of the abovementioned solvents and a method in which said amorphous powder is first dissolved in water and then the aforementioned organic solvent is added to the solution to have the resulting crystal precipitated. On the other hand, there is another method in which an acid addition salt of the cepholosporin derivative 1 is dissolved in water or an organic solvent such as methanol, ethanol and propanol or a mixed solvent thereof and then nautralized with a base such as triethylamine, sodium hydroxide and sodium carbonate to yield crystal. In the abovementioned crystallization or recrystallization effected in water or aqueous solution, a crystalline hydrate is usually obtained.In case where crystallization is carried out in an organic solvent, a crystalline anhydride or solvate is obtained. The solvate can be easily converted into an anhydride. The crystalline anhydride or solvate can be converted into a hydrate by allowing it in a gas which contains water vapor.Reaction Scheme BEMI22.1 EMI23.1 In Reaction Scheme B, the compound of the formula 4 or its salt or reactive derivative thereof is made to react with the compound of the formula 5 or its salt or ester thereof or reactive derivative thereof.
