# PROTECTION OF GRAPHITE ELECTRODES

## Abstract
Apparatus for protection of graphite electrodes of elec tric arc furnaces e.g. for steelmaking to reduce loss of graphite from sides of the electrode by oxidation has at least one gene rally arcuate spray unit 6, 7 with means 8 12 for moving the spray unit towards and away from a side of the electrode. The spray unit has means for spraying protective matter towards the centre of its arc. The apparatus permits protection of the part of an electrode between the electrode clamp and furnace roof without removing the electrode from the roof.
