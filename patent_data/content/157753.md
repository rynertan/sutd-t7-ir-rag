## Description
NEW SOMATOSTATIN COMPOUNDS, PROCESS FOR THEIR SYNTHESIS, PREPARA TION FOR VETERINARY USE CONTAINING SAID COMPOUNDS AND PROCESS FOR THE TREATMENT OF ANIMALS. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION. 1. Field of the Invention. The present invention is related to new somatostatin compounds constituting a synthetic vaccine applicable for the treatment of animals, a synthesis process for the compounds, a preparation for veterinary use containing said new compounds and a process for the treatment of animals. 2. Description of the Prior Art. Some anabolizing hormonal compounds steroids have been used in stock rearing in order to promote the weight gain of cattle. The treatment by means of implanted steroids or analogs has the major drawback that the toxic residues remain in the animal tissues and the administration of these substances has been forbidden in many countries. R. Arnon et al Les antigens et vaccins synth√©tiques. LaRecherche N 142, March 1983, Vol.14 pp.346 357 PARIS,France, describe synthetic vaccines and the use ofN acetylmuramyl L alanyl D isoglutamine or MDP for muramyl dipeptide and homologues thereof in such synthetic vaccines e.g. to increase the antigenic nature of P2 A L to which it is bound in a covalent manner. Said article also describes a synthetic antigenic material resulting from MDP and a synthetic peptide having the sequence of the hormone responsible in the males for the regulation cf the pression of testosterone. The conjugate has been experienced ze marine mice.In the publication EP A 0089290 ANVAR , the same technique has been used to prepare conjugates of MDP and hormone various nature. The publication describes essentially veterinary vaccines allowing an increase of meat production by an immunologic castration obtained by a conjugate of MDP with human chorionic gonadotropine hCG . The present invention aims accordingly to avoid the cited drawbacks of the administration of anabolizing or of castrating compounds and includes accordingly a new approach to the promotion of growth and or milk production of domestic animals. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION.The growth hormone also called somatotropin is the main hormone associated with the post natal growth. It is known that the secretion of this hormone is regulated by two neuropeptides, on the one hand somatostatin which inhibits the release of the growth hormone and on the other hand somatocrinin which stimulates the synthesis and the secretion of the growth hormone.The principle on which the present invention rests, consist in a vaccinal preparation valuable for inhibiting or neutralizing the endogenous somatostatin of the treated animal.The active ingredient of new vaccine of the present invention is a compound resulting from coupling of the N acetylmuramyl L alanyl D isoglutamine or a homologue thereof with somatostatin or a homologue in the natural or oxidized state or in the pro form or its pre proforms.The term homologues is thereafter defined.The process, using said vaccine GPP Growth promoting peptide or any of its derivatives is designed to increase growth and development of domestic animals of various species, among which and more specifically the bovine, for meat production. The first degree of the procedure is to directly immunize Dy the GPP or its derivatives the recipient animal for which it is intended to increase growth and development.The term derivative is thereafter defined.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION.The immunization scheme results in various types of antibodies 1. a first order are potentially directed against epitoces represented by somatostatin or its homologues. The coupling methods of somatostatin or its homologues have indeed been designed to keep intact the greatest number of epitopes expressed by these peptides.2. a second order are antibodies directed by epitopes created by the GPP itself or its homologues and specific to these new types of coupled molecules. These antibodies are nevertheless capable of cross reacting with endogenous material such as or similar to somatostatin or muramyl peptides.3. a third order are antibodies reacting selectively with epitopes created by the muramyl peptides.It is presumed, in view of our experimental data, that these various antibodies are all potentially involved in the observed phenomena, i.e. increased development of the immunized animals. To achieve the effects, the antibodies have to neutralize biological endogenous materials, which are thus less capable or uncapable of directing an effect, the net result being an increase in growth and muscle development.Conversely, the antibodies could interact with substances present in the animal, either as endogenous material or beared by hosts or parasites of the animals. Through the interaction, effects adverse to growth and development are neutralized through humoral or humoral and cellular immunity.The affinity constant Ka of the association reaction between the antibodies and above described antigenic materials have to reach a magnitude ranging from 10 7 L M to 10 13 L M. The process of increasing growth and development of animals can also be achieved by passive immunization. In that case, immunoglobulins of the required characteristics such as listed above, could be elicited in recipient animals and purified from their biological fluids. The necessary antibodies can also be obtained through the cellular fusion techniques, hybridoma selection and culture, harvesting culture medium and ascitic fluids and purification of the monoclonal antibodies possessing the required characteristics.An approach by recombinant DNA technology can also be used to produce the required antibodies by genetic engineering. The vaccine may specifically be the compound resulting from the coupling of an ester, e.g. the C1 C10 alkyl ester ofN acetylmuramyl L alanyl D isoglutaminyl L lysine at the carboxylic group of somatostatin or an ester of somatostatin e.g. the C1 C10 alkylester thereof at the carboxylic end ofMDP in the natural or oxidized state or in the pro formThe preferred compounds of the invention obtained in this manner have the formula I or II hereafterEMI6.1 wherein SRIF represents somatostatin or a homolosue thereof. The compounds of the invention may be administrated in appropriate form e.g. in the form of a preparation for veterinary use in a physiological liquid containing an excipient such as polyethylenglycol in the proportion of 150 mg in 100 ml.The procedures of immunization is based on a single or multiple immunizing injections preferably a parenteral injection containing the GPP or its homologs in an effective quantity which can vary from 10 to 500 ug per dose depending upon the species of the recipient and the type of procedure chosen active or passive immunization . Said parenteral injection may be e.g. an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection possibly followed by one or more boosting injections. However other modes of administration such as oral or a nasal spray administration are also contemplated by the present invention.Similarly, the antibodies which can be passively administrated to the recipient animal would be administered in doses varying from at least 5 mg kg body weight in variable doses, e.g. from 1 to 5 doses at an interval of e.g.several days.It is understood that the growth promoting mechanism could involve anti idiotype antibodies. These could be responsible partially or totally to the observed effect on these intended to be produced.Any suitable excipient which would respect or enhance the immunogenic properties of the vaccine or of the vaccine vehiculated by an immunostimulating complex is part of the invention.The dosage of active ingredient in the compositions of this invention may be varied, however it is necessary that the amount of the active ingredient shall be such that a suitable dosage form is obtained. The selected dosage depends upon the desired therapeutic effect on the route of administration, and on the duration of the treatment. Advantageous pharmaceutical compositions are constituted by injectable solutions or suspensions containing an effective dose of at least one product according to the invention.Preferably, these solutions or suspensions are formed in an isotonic sterilized aqueous phase preferably saline or glucosed. The invention relates more particularly to such suspensions or solutions which are suitable for administration by intradermal, intramuscular or sub cutaneous injection, or again by scarification and notably pharmaceutical composition in the form of liposomes whose constitution ix well known.It relates also to pharmaceutical compositions administrable by other routes, notably by the oral or rectal route, or again in the form of aerosols designed to be applied to the mucous membranes, notably the ocular, nasal, pulmonary or vaginal mucous membranes.In consequence, it relates to pharmaceutical compositions in which one at least of the compounds according to the invention is associated with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, solid or liquid, adapted to the constitution of oral, ocular or nasal forms, or with excipients adapted for the constitution of rectal forms of administration, or again with gelatinous excipients for vaginal administration. It relates also to isotonic liquid compositions containing one at least of the products according to the invention, adapted for administration to the mucous membranes, notably the ocular to nasal mucous membranes. It relates lastly to compositions formed of pharmaceutically acceptables liquified gases of the propellant type, in which the products according to the invention are dissolved or held in suspension, and of which the release causes the dispersions in an aerosol.Preparations according to this invention for parental administrations include sterile aqueous or non aqueous solutions, suspensions or emulsions. Examples of non aqueous solvents or vehicles are propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils, such as olive oil and corn oil, gelatin and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate.Such dosage forms may also contain adjuvant such as preserving, wetting, emulsifying and dispersing agents. They may be sterilized by, for example, filtration through a bacteria retaining filter, by incorporating sterilizing agents into the compositions, by irradiating the compositions, or by heating the compositions. They can also be manufactured in the form of sterile water, or some other sterile injectable medium immediatly before use.Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which may contain, in addition to the active substance, excipients such as cocoa butter or a suppository wax.Composition for nasal or sublingual administration are also prepared with standard excipients well known in the art. The compounds are useful in a process for the treatment of domestic animals in view of stimulating their growth and or the production of milk.The technique has a series of advantages, compared to known techniques, among which one may citeThe increase of weight gain and the weight production results directly from an increased secretion of the endogenic growth hormone.Due to the similarity, i.e. the homology of the structure of somatostatin or its homologues for several domestic animals, the vaccine may be used for a great variety of animals, without structural modification.The technique, compared to other suggested procedures, is easily carried out and requires only a limited number of injections. Furthermore, the treatment by means of the proposed vaccine, produces the same effects regarding weight increase and milk production than the treatments by means of exogenic growth hormone which is expensive and difficult to obtain or to produce and which furthermore causes difficulties for a slow and regular release of the exogenic hormone in the treated animals. It does further not interfere with the HCG system, and causes no immunologic castration. The starting materials for the preparation of the vaccine can be easily obtained and are relatively cheap. The techniques which are used for the synthesis of the vaccine are well defined, reproductible and in the reach of normally equipped laboratories for the synthesis of peptides.The use of the vaccine of the invention allows to avoid the difficult studies which are necessary for the use of implants and the necessity of producing the growth hormone in great quantity, in particular by the techniques of genetic engineering. The proposed technique also avoids the mass production by the genetic way, in particular of the specific growth hormone for each species. It is moreover known that the administration of a growth hormone prepared by means of pituitary bodies collected in slaughter houses is a not commercially profitable treatment.The highly immuno reactive characteristic of the vaccine of the invention allows a limited number of injections.The growth promoting peptide of the invention may thus be regarded as a mean which is easy, efficient, relatively non expensive and safe to reach the wished aim.PREPARATION OF PRODUCTS ACCORDING TO THE INVENTION.The process for coupling N acetylmuramyl L alanyl D isoglutamine or a homologues with somatostatin or a homologues in the natural or oxidized state or in the pro form or its pre proforms may be performed by any of the methods well known in the art.Such methods have for instance been described in PublicationsEP A 0 003833 Ciba Geigy and its counterparts AU A 1248583 and JP A 58208237 which are incorporated herein by reference.In carrying out the process, it appeared that the ratio ofN acetylmuramyl L alanyl D isoglutamine or a homologue thereof to somatostatin or a homologue thereof may be varied in several ratios canprised between 1 1 and 3 1 while exercing effects which are qualitively similar.DEFINITION OF HOMOLOGUES AND DERIVATIVES.On the basis of the original immunogen molecular structure GPP, muramyl di or tripeptide a series of homologues would result from a. Homologues to the somatostatin portion, b. Homologues of muramyl peptide s , c. Compounds resulting from the original portion of the molecule or their homologues but created by different coupling, thereafter called derivatives.These homologues or derivatives could be used to increase growth and meat production with an efficiency which compares at various degrees with that of original GPP s Homologues at the level of the somatostatin portion On the model of the oxydized 14 amino acid polypeptide, substitution of any of those 14 residues could be replaced by a D instead of the initial L form. Typical analogs are a D tryptophanyl residue in position 8, D bromo or fluoro Trp in the same position. A radical change in the nature of all amino acids can be obtained in any position of the chain by a natural or non natural L or D aminoacid taurine or aminobutyric acid for example . DES forms are also usable as well as cyclic forms non reductible cyclic analogs . Pro forms, such as S.S. 28 amino acids form and SS DES 25 proform under their reduced or oxydized forms are usable. Other forms with additional NH2 terminal aminoacid resulting from peptide synthesis or DNA recombinant techniques could be used either as a molecule presenting a portion of the natural presequence or as molecules exhibiting any sort of substitution in any position of this proform.Molecules resulting from the protection of reactive groups on the side chains of the aminoacids are also usable such as for the OH groups acetyl, benzoyl, terbutyl, trityl, tetrahydro pyramyl, benzyl, 2,6 dichlorobenzyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, guanyl, nitroso, tosyl, for E NHv groups paramethoxybenzyl, paramethylbenzyl, acetamidomethyl, tritil and benzyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, adamentyloxy carbonyl, terbutyloxycarbonyl,. for the COOH groups methyl, ethyl, benzyl, dichlorobenzyl or any other esters, up to ten atoms of long aliphatic chain,amnde or azideGlycosylated somatostatin analog could result from the glycosylation of 5 asparagine, 13 serine, 10 and 12threonine or any other position provided that this position is occupied by one of these 3 amino acidsSubstitution of sulfur in cysteine residue by selenium atome would yield a somatostatin homologue in its reduced and oxydized form.Additional derivatisation of the somatostatin portion of anyGPP could result from the use of a polymer of various order of somatostatin itself retaining at least one and preferably multiple immunogenic determinants of somatostatin.Homologues at the level of the muramyl peptide. A serie of homologues would automatically result from the method used for the synthesis of the muramyl peptide by protecting hydroxyl groups, essentially by benzyl and benzylidene. Substitution of hydrogen of l hydroxy group or l hydroxy of the saccharide ring could be performed by alkyl, aryl, alkylaryl, arylalkyl or by amino group. These substitutes would have functional groups such as hydroxy, amine, carboxamide, sulfonamide, ether, thioether.Preferentially 4 carbone would bear hydrogen atom and hydroxyl groups and oxyacyl could be present.2 hydroxyl group of saccharide ring could be substituted by acetamido or glycolyl amido groups.Substitution of hydrogen of 6 hydroxy function or 6 hydroxy of the saccharide ring could be protected by carboxamide, sulfonamide, ether, thioether, ester, thioester or replaced by amine.These groups could possibly bear aryl, phenyl, heterocyclic, alkyl, carbonyl, amino, sulfhydryl, peroxyl groups.A typical substitution of H atom of 6 hydroxy could be achieved by fatty acids to create a 6 0 stearic homologue of muramyl peptides for example. This type of homologue could also be inserted into a liposome to create a particularly active immunogen. In the peptide moiety of the muramyl peptide, the alanyl residue could be substituted by arginyl, asparagyl, aspartyl, glutamyl, glycyl, histidyl, hydroxyprolyl, lsoleucyl, leucyl, lysyl, methionyl, phenylalanyl, prolyl, seryl, threonyl, tryptophanyl, tyrosyl, valyl, aminobutyryl residues. The carboxyl function of the D isoglutaminyl residue coulc also be esterified or substituted by any other amino acid having an other carboxylic function. The lysyl residue of the muramyl tripeptide could be substituted by an amino acid having supplementary to their amino and carboxylic functions, an amino, hydroxyl or acid function. Such amin acid could be aspartic acid, glutamic acid, ornithine, tyrosine.Derivatives resulting from alternative coupling of MDP and homologues with somatostatin or homologues. The procedures to obtain alternative coupling involve functional groups present on one of the reaction partners such as amine, carboxyl, sulfhydryl, alcohol, reactive ester and the complementary reacting group on the other reaction partner. The reaction is made in the presence of an appropriate condensation reagent. Before the reaction, protecting groups could be introduced on all functional groups which would not be involved in the reaction. The coupling reaction could be made with MDP homologues substituted preferentially on positions 1 and 6 of the saccharide portion of the MDP or homologues by groups like phenylisocyanate and diazonium respectively. These reagents would react with the free amine group of somatostatin or homologues. In the case in which the only reacting group possessed by the reaction partner would be free amine groups, coupling reaction would be realized using glutaraldehyde or benzoquinone. Photoactivated coupling can be used to conjugate somatostatin homologues devoid of reacting groups.This can include the substitution on the osidic cycles or on the peptide side chain of the MDP or homologues by nitrene or carbene functions.These photoactivated reactions can lead to insertion in the aliphatic, saturated or non saturated chains present in the somatostatin or its homologues. Coupling can also be made when somatostatin or its homologues and MDP and its homologues possess one free SH group and one maleimide function. An alternate coupling method can result from the reaction between a carboxyl group present in one partner and an amine group in the second partner of the reaction.This will create derivatives possessingN hydroxysuccinimide ester function. The reacting carboxyl group will either present naturally or placed by synthesis either on the saccharidic or peptidic portion of the MDP or its homologues or somatostatin or its homologues. Also usable is the method utilizing mixed anhydrides alkylchloro carbonate in a alkaline medium . This methode creates a bond between a carboxyl group present in one partner with an amine group present in the other partner. This reaction is being carried out preferentially in anhydrous medium. Coupling through √† Schiff base is possible when glycozylated homologues of the peptide portion of MDP or its homologues or of somatostatin or its homologues react with a functional amine group present on the other partner or any of its homologues. Examples and synthesis methods for somatostatin homologues are described in the following publications, which are given for illustration purpose only, said homologues being well known to those specialized in the art.

EXAMPLE 2.TREATMENT OF YOUNG BULLS WITH THE GROWTH PROMOTING PEPTIDES GPP .After a 2 months observation period ajustment to husbandry conditions and base line measurements , thirty young bulls of around 250 kg were observed for 7 months.They were injected four times with 100 ug of GPP or a mixture of equivalent amounts of muramyl di or triptide and SRIF.Samples were solubilized in physiological medium supplemented with 40 W V polyethyleneglycol 6000. Intramuscular injections in the neck of animals were performed with 3 ml of the solution at days 0, 10, 30 and 60 of the 7 months period.During the seventh months treatment period the animals received a concentrate ad libitum. Each month, the animals were weighed and blood samples were taken for further analyses. The results concerning the parameters studied in this zootechnical experiment were summarized in the following.1 Statistical analysis of the life weight gain of control and treated animals. Variance analysis of the body live weight gain has been performed on 27 animals alive on September 27, 1984 16 controls and 11 treated animals . At that time, the difference of life weight gain between the 16 control animals and the 11 treated animals was 31.3 kg per animal, i.e. 11 over controls. This difference is statistically significant at P 0.10. If the performance of the 3 animals accidentally dead during the experiment were being taken into additional consideration, the difference in the life weight gain between control and treated animals would be found to be 34.9kg per animal, in favour of the treated ones. The deviation measured between the life gain of treated animals of batch 5 SRIF,MTP treated and 3 SRIF, MDP treated is low 5.7kg and without any statistical significance. During the experimental period, the food intake of the treated animals was 50kg higher that that of the control one. For a same food intake, the total weight gain of a treated animal is 30 keg higher than that of control animals. The food intake per kg live weight gain decrease from 5.46 controls to 5.06kg treated ones representing 400 g less in favor of the treated animals . Analysis of the graphs shows that the treatment gives moderate results during the first twa months, a steeper increase in weight gain in the following 3 months and an apparent slow down in the remaining period. Carcass analysis, on rib segment and carcass relative composition in muscles, adipo connective tissues and bones was performed. The treated animals exhibited similar proportions in these compartments as compared to the controls. Treatment of animals by GPP.Survey of biological parametersThe following parameters have been studied throughout to experimental blood glucose T4 RIA T3 RIA non difference between treated and control animals. Testosterone RIA Growth hormone RIA has been measured At the third month after the initial GPP injection.No statistical difference between treated and control animals.Anti SRIF antibodiesThe detection of free binding sites for SRIF has been performed at various period after initial treatment using 1251 Tyr SRIF as tracer. A charcoal separation was used for measurement of bound and free radioactivity after a 48h incubation period, at 4 C of the tracers with various dilutions of the serum samples.Specific binding is noted 3 months after the initial GPP injection, and is mainly restricted to the animals treated by the GPP s .Indeed ninty percents of animals treated with GPP exhibited binding sites for 1251 Tyr SRIF Titers never exceed 1 200 final dilutions for GPP treated animals and remain stable during all the experimental period.
