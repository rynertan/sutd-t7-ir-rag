# Transparent electromagnetic shield and method of manufacturing thereof.

## Abstract
A transparent electromagnetic shield 20 adapted for use on an information display device in electronic equipment comprises first and second transparent substrates 21, 22 each having major front and back surfaces are adapted to be mated together with a front surface 21A of one substrate fac ing a back surface 22B of the other. A conductive wire screen 23 is interposed between the first and second substrates in physical contact with one of the mating front and back sur faces thereof and a single layer 24 of polymer laminating ma terial is interposed between the screen and the other of the mating surfaces. The layer of polymer laminating material fills the apertures in the screen and contacts portions of both mat ing surfaces to bond the screen 23 and the two substrates 21, 22 together. An embodiment in which the wire screen 33 is provided in contact with a conductive transparent optical coating on one of the mating surfaces of the substrates is also disclosed. A conductive metal tape is wrapped around the edge of the substrate 31 in contact with the wire screen 23 to serve as a bus bar 25 contact to the screen, enabling use of a screen 23 the same size as the substrate 21 .
