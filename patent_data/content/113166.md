## Description
DATA PROCESSING SYSTEM This invention relates generally to a system wherein information is transferred between a communications controller and a number of work stations, each of which may include a keyboard and a cathode ray tube display. It relates more particularly to a system wherein the information is transferred serially over a single coaxial cable, one end of the coaxial cable being coupled to the communications controller and each of the work stations tapping in to the coaxial cable and also to the logic in the communications controller which receives the information data bit stream from a work station and synchronizes the data bit stream with the communications controller clocking system. any data processing systems include a number of work stations. A work station may include a keyboard which permits an operator entry into the system and a cathode ray tube display which displays the information keyed in by the operator for verification before transferring the information to a central processing unit or displaying information received from the central processing unit. In one known data processing system, a number of work stations are coupled by a multiconductor cable to a display controller which is in turn coupled to a processor through a phone line. In another, a number of work stations are coupled by a multiconductor cable to a multiplexer which is in turn coupled to a central processor unit. These systems require the use of a multiconductor cable, which is costly and also limits the distance the work stations may be from the controller. Also, in past designs the relatively high cost of logic components dictated a design wherein functions were time shared in a central controller rather than duplicated in each work station. This often limited the data transfer rate between the work stations and the central controllers. With regard to the synchronization problem, in one known system, information being transferred from a remote work station to a controller over a single conductor is received as a serial string of data bits. The serial string may be made up of asynchronous characters, that is, having a start bit, a number of data bits, and one or two stop bits. A clocking system operating at 16 times the bit rate locates the center of the start bit and strobes the center of the subsequent data and stop bits. The start and stop bits may be removed and the data bits sent as a synchronous stream to increase the character rate. In communications systems which include modems, the modem generates a separate clock which is received by the controller and samples the data bits. It was desirable, however, to eliminate the separate clock signal and replace it with clocking logic internal to the controller. The clocking logic generated a clocking signal 16 times the data bit rate and a particular clock signal was selected to sample the midpoint of each of the synchronous data bits. Apparatus is known for synchronizing the byte timing signal to the byte. A microprocessor generates a fixed format of binary ONE s and binary ZERO s to determine the number of bits between the byte timing signal and the start of the byte. Apparatus is also known for synchronizing the serial data bits to the communications controller. However, as the demand for communicating with a larger number of work stations grew, the need for a higher data bit rate and an improved means of synchronizing the data to the controller clock was needed to assure that the data was received with a reduced number of errors and thereby reducing the number of retransmission requests. According to one aspect, the present invention provides an interactive data processing system comprising a single conductor coaxial bus having a predetermined length, and a central station and a plurality of work stations, each coupled in common to the bus characterized in that the central station includes a high speed link controller coupled to the bus for trasmitting and receiving information to and from any one of the work stations at a predetermined bit rate. According to another aspect, the invention provides, for an interactive terminal system, synchronization means comprising a cyclic counter characterized in that the means for synchronizing the counter comprise a comparator fed from the counter and with a fi xed count an adder fed from the counter and with a pair of adjustment counts, 0 and 2 and gating circuitry responsive to the output of the comparator when an incoming signal is received to select, if that signal occurs before or after the fixed count, the adjustment count of 2 or 0 respectively at the adder and to load the counter with the output of the adder.

I NTRODUCTOiZY aUN ARY An interactive terminal data processing system includes a number of work stations and a high speed link controller HSLC , all coupled in common to a single conductor coaxial bus for transferring information between one of the work stations and the HSLC. The transfer of information is typically at 750,000 bits per second. The length of the coaxial bus is typically I km. The HSLC includes a microprocessor, a dynamic random access memory RAM , and a communications controller and data recovery logic. The microprocessor receives information from a dynamic random access memory RAM for transfer, a byte at a time, to a communications controller. The communications controller transfers the information serially to the data recovery logic which generates STROBE and POLARITY signals indicative of the information bits for transfer over the coaxial bus. TheSTROBE and POLARITY signals are shaped by analog circuits to minimize the reflections and noise on the coaxial bus which would tend to generate false data signals. The data signals are received by a selected work station. A work station sends information over the coaxial bus which is received by the analog circuits and synchronized to the HSLC clocking system by the data recovery logic.The information is then stored in the communications controller, and transferred to the microprocessor for storage in the RAM. The data recovery logic 75 includes a free running counter 75 16 which generates four binary signals indicating a decimal count of from 0 through 15. During steady state operation, the data bits are received by the data recovery logic when the count is decimal 8 and transferred to the communications controller 72 when the count is decimal 0. Initially the data signals may be received by the data recovery logic at any time, decimal 0 through decimal 15, and the counter output is either incremented or decremented by successive binary ZERO data bits to adjust the data recovery logic to normally clock the data bits when the count is decimal 8. The data recovery logic also includes a comparator 75 18 and an adder 75 14. The comparator generates an A less than B signal when the decimal count is less than decimal 8 and generates an A equals B signal when the decimal count is equal to decimal 8. The adder receives the decimal count from the counter and adds decimal 2 to the decimal count in response to the A less than B signal.The output of the adder, therefore, is either equal to the decimal count from the counter or is equal to the decimal count incremented by decimal 2. A ZERO data bit applied to the LOAD terminal of the counter results in the output of the adder being loaded into the counter except when theA equals B signal is active. Since the counter is loaded at CLOCK time, if the ZERO data bit is received at a decimal count of from decimal 0 through decimal 7, the counter is incremented by decimal 2. As an example, if the ZERO data bit is received at a decimal count of decimal 3, then the next decimal count would have been decimal 4. Instead, the adder output of decimal 5 is loaded into the counter. If the ZERO data bit is received at a decimal count of from decimal 9 through decimal 15, then the decimal count is repeated since the adder loads the same decimal count that is at the output of the counter into the counter. DETAILED DESCRIPTION Figure 1 shows a block diagram of a typical multiapplication interactive terminal system 1. Operators seated at work stations may input information into the system via keyboards and receive requested information from the system via cathode ray tube CRT displays. A work station includes a keyboard and a display, and a printer if required by the application. The typical.system of Figure 1 may have 48 work stations, work station 1 and keyboard 1 16 1 to work station 48 and keyboard 48 16 48. Note that printer 16 1A is included in the work station 16 1. Four work stations are coupled to each device controllers 14 1 to 14 4 for a total of 16 work stations 16 1 to 16 16, and 32 work stations 16 17 to 16 48 are coupled to a high speed link controller HSLC 12. The HSLC 12 is coupled to work stations 16 17 to 16 32 by a bus 12 1 and coupled to work stations 16 33 to 16 48 by a bus 12 2. The maximum length of buses 12 1 and 12 2 is 1 km. An 8 inch floppy disk 18 stores data pertinent to the application for which system 1 is used. As an example, when system 1 is used in a financial application, the floppy disk 18 may store information about customer accounts and recent transactions prior to transmission to the host. Floppy disk 18 is coupled to disk controller 14 5. A host computer 20 may couple system 1 to a communication network for enabling communication with other terminal systems or other host computers in the network. Host computer 20 is coupled to device controller 14 6. Work stations 16 1 to 16 16 share common logic in device controllers 14 1 to 14 4 whereas work stations 16 17 to 16 48 each contain all of the logic necessary to perform the work station function. They do not share common logic. Device controllers 14 1 to 14 6 and HSLC 12 are coupled in common to a system bus 2 as are a central processor CPU 4, a random access memory RAM 8 and a read only memory ROM 10. Note that the interactive terminal system 1 is not limited to these devices. The HSLC 12 controls the transfer of information between one of the work stations 16 17 to 16 48 and a device coupled to system bus 2. Information transfers at 750 kilobits per second. RAM 8 may store the operating system software, processor stack addresses and application programs. ROM 10 may store diagnostic programs for debugging system 1, programs for initializing system 1 during the Power On sequence as well as application programs. CPU 4 controls the operation by generating the system bus 2 timing cycles. The CPU 4 generates direct memory access DMA cycles and CPU cycles. During a DMA cycle, a device such as the HSLC 12 may communicate with RAM 8 by the HSLC 12 sending address signals over system bus 2 to.RAM 8 and receiving during the DMA cycle a data byte which was stored in the RAM 8 address location over system bus 2. The CPU 4 also establishes system bus 2 cycle priorities. The RAM 8 chip refresh cycle has the highest priority. Next in priority is the system bus 2 cycle called a DMA cycle for transferring information betweenRAM 8, ROM 10 or device controllers 14 1 to 14 4 and one of the device controllers 14 5 to 14 6 or HSLC 12. Following in priority is a screen refresh cycle for the CRT s of display 1 16 1 to display 16 16 16. TheCPU 4, which is operative during CPU cycles, has the lowest system bus 2 cycle priority.The CPU 4 is also responsive to instructions received from RAM 8 or ROM 10 for typically controlling the interactive terminal system 1 operation including branching to error routines, processing interrupts, and performing diagnostic routines as well as application programs. Figure 2 showS a block diagram of the HSLC 12 whose primary function is to transfer data byte signals DO through D7 between one of the devices coupled to system bus 2 and the work stations 16 17 to .16 48, one work station at a time, via a data bus 34 of system bus 2. A multiprotocol serial communications controller 72 communicates with work stations 16 17 to 16 32 via analog circuits 76 and data recovery logic 75 and communicates with work stations 16 33 to 16 48 via analog circuits 78 and data recovery logic 75. Data byte signals DO to D7 are transferred between work stations 16 17 to 16 48 and a dynamic random access memory RAM 52, and between dynamic RAM 52 and RAM 8. RAM 52 may receive data byte signals DO through D7 from ROM 10. A microprocessor 30 controls the transfer of data byte signals DO to D7 in the HSLC 12. For transferring the first of a block cf data byte signals DO through D7 stored in dynamic RAM 52 to a selected work station 16 17 to 16 48, the microprocessor 30 transfers address signals ADO to AD7 to an address register 41 and address signals A8 to A15 to an address register 40. Output signals AO to A7 from address register 41 and address signals A8 to A15 from address register 40 are applied to the input terminals of a dynamic RAM controller 50 from address register 42. The dynamic RAM controller 50 multiplexes address signals AO to A7 and A8 to A15 to generate signals DRAMO to DRAM7 which address dynamicRAM 52 on 2 8 bit cycles to effect a 16 bit address. The addressed data byte DO D7 is stored in a register 54 for transfer communications controller 72. Microprocessor 30 applies status signals SO, S1 and S2 to a bus controller 38 to generate an I O W signal which is applied to and results in the communications controller 72 receiving the data byte signals DO to D7 for transfer to work stations 16 17 to 16 48. Microprocessor 30 generates successive addresses to transfer a block of data byte signals DO through D7, the first byte identifying the work station receiving the block of data byte signals DO through D7. The bus controller 38 generates a memory read signal and a memory write signal shown as signals M R W that enable the various memories, PROM 46, static RAM 48 and dynamic RAM 52. Bus controller 38 also generates an I O write signal and an I O read signal shown as signals I OR W to enable the various registers, link ID 64, status 68, system control 70, C D port register 60, NMI register 62 and 15XX flags 66. Data byte signals DO to D7 are transferred from dynamic RAM 52 to RAM 8 under microprocessor 30 control during the DMA cycle. Under microprocessor 30 control, bus controller 38 generates a DMA write request DMAWRTRQ signal on a control bus 36 of system bus 2. CPU 4 is responsive to the DMAWRTRQ signal and generates a DMA acknowledge DMAACK signal giving the HSLC 12 access to system bus 2. Address signals AO to A7 from address register 41 and address signals A8 to A15 from address register 40 generated by microprocessor 30 select data byte signals DO to D7 from dynamic RAM 52 via dynamic RAM controller 50 and are stored in register 54 for transfer to data bus 34 via data drivers 58. Also, microprocessor 30 generates the RAM 8 memory address signals AO to A19 for storage in address registers 40 and 41.The data byte signals DO to D7 are transferred to RAM 8 from data register 54 via data bus 58 over data bus 34 of system bus 2 and the address signals AO through A19 are transferred through address buffer 44 to RAM 8 via address bus 32 of system bus 2. The HSLC 12 receives data bytes from RAM 8 for storage in dynamic RAM 54 under microprocessor 30 control.Status signals SO, S1 and S2 applied to bus controller 38 generates the DMA read request DMARDRQ signal. The CPU 4 is responsive to the DMARDRQ signal to generate the DMA acknowledge signal DMAACK again giving the HSLC 12 access to system bus 2. Microprocessor 30 loads address registers 40 and 41 with the RAM 8 address location of the requested data byte which is sent out on address bus 32 as signals AO to A19. The data byte from RAM 8 is received over data bus 34 and stored in a register 56.Microprocessor 30 loads the address registers 40 and 41 with the dynamic RAM 52 address location into which the data byte stored in register 56 is written. The data byte in register 56 is then stored in dynamic RAM 52 at the address location signals AO through A75 stored in address registers 40 and 41. A programmable read only memory PROM 46 stores a bootstrap routine which is operative during the system initialization operation to store program information into static RAM 48 and dynamic RAM 52. PROM 46 may also store the firmware that operates with the microprocessor 30 and also store diagnostics for testing the HSLC 12. Static RAM 48 stores the interrupt vectors which indicate to the microprocessor which of the possible conditions within the HSLC 12 is interrupting the microprocessor 30. Static RAM 48 also provides firmware workspace during the execution of firmware programs by microprocessor 30. The HSLC 12 contains three types of registers registers that interface to the system bus 2, registers that interface to the HSLC 12 data bus 35, and registers that interface with both the system bus 2 and HSLC 12 data bus 35 and address bus 32. In response to a command from CPU 4 for the HSLC 12 identification code, the HSLC 12 sends the output signalsDO through D7 of a link ID 64 over data bus 34 to CPU 4.This allows CPU 4 to verify the identity of the HSLC 12 during the system initialization operation. A control logic 69 receives address signals AO to A3 from the CPU 4 via address bus 32 to generate a number of signals. Signal NATE causes a nonavailable trap interrupt that is, the HSLC 12 did not respond during a firmware debugging or maintenance operation and tries to reinitialize the HSLC 12. Signal RESET indicates that theHSLC 12 communication with the CPU 4 is not reestablished during the firmware debugging or maintenance operation and reinitializes the HSLC 12. Signal CMD D indicates a command byte or a data byte is stored in a C D port register 60. Signal BUSY indicates that the CPU 4 found the C D port register 60 full, that is, an indication that the HSLC 12 has not yet processed the last command or data byte received from CPU 4. Signal NATE is applied to a NMI register 62 to generate a nonmaskable interrupt NMI signal to microprocessor 30. Signals CMD D and BUSY are transferred to data signal lines D6 and D7 respectively by 15XX flags 66. System control 70 generates an interrupt request signal 15XX IRQ to indicate to CPU 4 that the HSLC 12 is sending information to CPU 4, and generates a LINK STS signal to the 15XX that the HSLC 12 is either waiting for a command or processing a current command. A typical command would be to poll one of the work stations 16 17 to 16 48. Status 68 places the BUSY and LINK STS signals on data signal lines D6 and D7 respectively, indicating the status of the C D port register 60 as empty or full. The RESET signal clears control logic 69, clears any requests the HSLC 12 is making of a DMA system bus 2 cycle, and restarts the microprocessor 30 to the initialization firmware sequence. Parity error detection 53 generates a parity error signal PARERR when sensing parity error in dynamic RAM 52. Signal PARERR is stored in NMI register 62 which generates the NMI signal to interrupt microprocessor 30. The microprocessor may then branch to a firmware routine to continue the HSLC 12 operation. The firmware makes a determination as to whether to continue utilizing the questionable RAM 52. The C D port register 60 is loaded with a data byte or a command byte from the CPU 4. The CPU 4 senses the busy bit of status 68 to assure that the HSLC 12 is responsive to receive the data byte or command byte. The NMI register 62 stores indications of a dynamicRAM 52 parity error, the number of address locations ofPROM 46 and dynamic RAM 52, and a nonavailable trap event NATE signal sent from the CPU 4 to the HSLC 12 indicating that the HSLC 12 is not responding to CPU 4 commands during system initialization or a maintenance operation. The parity error signal and NATE signal generate a nonmaskable interrupt NMI signal to the microprocessor 30 which can immediately branch to a maintenance firmware routine. Data line signal DO from NMI register 62 indicates a parity error, signal D1 indicates a nonavailable trap event NATE , signal D2 indicates a PROM 46 option and signal D3 indicates a dynamic RAM 52 option. Referring to Figure 3, the HSLC 12 uses a bit oriented protocol which utilizes a frame structure for, information interchange between the HSLC 12 and the work stations 16 17 to 16 48. Information transferred from communications controller 72 to the work stations 16 17 to 16 48 is contained in frames, each frame starting and ending with the hexadecimal 7E binary 0111 1110 byte. Hexadecimal 7E is a unique byte code. Since data could contain the hexadecimal 7E pattern, the communications controller 72, after transmitting five consecutive binary ONE s, inserts a binary ZERO. The receiver, one of the work stations 16 17 to 16 48, deletes the first binary ZERO that follows five consecutive binary ONE bits. The communications controller 72 can distinguish between hexadecimal 7E as a flag or as a data character. Following the start of frame character hexadecimal 7E is an 8 bit device address DDDD DDDD. Each of the work stations 16 17 to 16 8 is assigned a unique 8 bit address code to which it responds. Valid addresses are from hexadecimal 01 binary 0000 0001 to hexadecimalFF binary 1111 1111 . Hexadecimal FF is termed the global address, that is, all work stations 14 17 to 14 48 as well as the HSLC 12 will respond to this address.An address of hexadecimal 00 is ignored. All work stations 16 17 to 16 48 in addition to responding to their original addresses respond to the hexadecimal FF address thereby permitting the HSLC 12 to broadcast a common message. The 8 control bits CCCC CCCC appear in all frames to define the type of frame sent between the HSLC 12 and the work stations 16 17 to 16 48. The frame types are an information I frame, a supervisory S frame, and an unnumbered U frame. The information field bytes IIII IIII l to IIII 1111 1024 , a maximum of 1024 bytes, appear only in the I frame. The HSLC 12 does not generate an information field for the S or U frame. The 2 byte frame sequence bits BBBB BBBB and BBBBBBBB provide cyclic check bytes for the frame. Excluded in the calculation for the cyclic check bytes are the binary ZERO s added after each five successive binary ONE bits. The S frame transfers supervisory commands such as Test for work station busy or Acknowledge I frames . The U frame commands are sent by the HSLC 12 to the work stations 16 17 to 16 48. Typical U frame commands result in the addressed work station sending back configuration information to the HSLC 12 in theinformation field. The configuration information includes buffer and memory size. Figure 4 shows the data recovery logic 75 of HSLC 12.Data recovery logic 75 receives data bits from work stations 16 17 to 16 32 via analog circuits 76 as signals UPA and DWNA and from work stations 16 33 to 16 48 via analog circuits 78 as signals UPB and DWNB and generates a receive clock signal RXC and a receive data signal RXD. The communications controller 72 uses the rising edge of the RXC signal to sample the RXD signal to indicate the receiving of a data pulse by data recovery logic 75 from analog circuits 76 or 78. The communications controller 72 assembles the data bits into bytes for transfer onto data bus 35, Figure 2, of signalsDO to D7. The data recovery logic 75 transmits the POLARITY andSTROBE signals to analog circuits 76 and 78 for transfer to an addressed work station 16 17 to 16 48. The data recovery logic 75 generates a transmit clock signalTXC. The communications controller 72 is responsive to signal TXC to generate a request to send signal RTS and a transmit data signal TXD. The TXC signal controls the rate at which data bits represented by the TXD signal are shifted out of the communications controller 72 to the data recovery logic 75 for generating the POLARITY andSTROBE signals. During the receive mode of operation, the data bits are received as signals UPA and DWNA or UPB and DWNB.Data recovery logic 75.adjusts its bit clocking system to synchronize with the stream of bits represented by signalsUPA and DWNA or UPB and DWNB. A counter 75 16 generates repeating binary count signals from output terminals QA,QB, QC and QD representing decimal 0 to decimal 15.During the steady state operation, binary count signals from counter 75 16 receives the UPA and DWNA or UPB andDWNB signals during 8 time and the data signal RXD is clocked into the communications controller 72 by the clock signal RXD at the start of O time . Initially, the UPA and DWNA or UPB and DWNB signals may be received at any time and the binary count signals are adjusted by incrementing the binary count signals by 1 if the firstUPA and DWNA or UPB and DWNB signals are received from 0 time to 7 time and decrementing the binary count signals by 1 if the UPA and DWNA or UPB and DWNB signals are received during 9 time to 15 time . The net effect is to adjust the system to nominally clock the data in at 8 time . Data bits sent from transmitting work stations 16 17 to 16 32 via analog circuits 76 are applied to OR gates 75 2 and 75 4 as signals UPA and DWNA respectively. Data bits sent from transmitting work stations 16 33 through 16 48 via analog circuits 78 are applied to OR gates 75 2 and 75 4 as signals UPB and DWNB respectively.Signal UPA at logical ONE indicates an information bit received by analog circuits 76 from one of the work stations 16 17 to 16 32 had a rising leading edge.Signal DWNA at logical ONE indicates that the information bit received by analog circuits 76 had a falling leading edge. Signals UPB and DWNB operate in a similar manner with analog circuits 78 and work stations 16 33 to 16 48. A multiplexer 75 50 selects the output of OR gates 75 2 and 75 4 for storage in registers R1 75 10 and 75 12 respectively on the rise of the 12 MHz clock output of inverter 75 40. Assuming either signal UPA or DWNA goes to logical ONE, then at the rise of the 12 MHz clock signal from inverter 75 40, the Q output of either register R1 75 10 or register R1 75 12 is forced to logical ONE. The Q outputs of register R2 75 10 and register R2 75 12 remain at logical ONE. Therefore, the output of a NAND gate 75 52 or a NAND gate 75 54 goes to logical ZERO forcing the output signal RCVGATE of a negative OR gate 75 56 to logical ONE. The RCVGATE signal remains at logical ONE until the rise of the next 12 MHz, clock pulse output from inverter 75 40.If register R1 75 10 stores signal UPA at logical ONE, then register R2 75 10 is set forcing the Q output signal to logical ZERO.If register R1 75 12 stores signal DWNA at logical ONE, then register R2 75 12 is set forcing the Q output signal to logical ZERO. In either case, the RCVGATE signal output of negative OR gate 75 56 is forced to logical ZERO indicating a data bit, basically synchronizing the data to the clock. The counter 75 16 counts the 12 MHz clock signals from an inverter 75 40 as long as the enable P ENP , enable T ENT , clear CLR and LOAD input terminals are at logical ONE. A comparator 75 18 receives the binary count signals from counter 75 16 at input terminals AO, Al, A2 and A3 which is compared with the decimal 8 binary 0001 applied to the BO, Bi, B2 and B3 input terminals. When the binary count from counter 75 16 equals decimal 8, the A equals B signal from terminal A B OUT is applied to a NAND gate 75 36 via an inverter 75 38. This forces the counter load signal CTRLD to logical ONE suppressing the load operation. When the binary count from counter 75 16 is equal to decimal 0 to decimal 7, then the A is less than B signal from A B OUT terminal of comparator 75 18 is applied to an A2 input terminal of an adder 75 14 thereby incrementing the binary count applied to input terminalsB1, B2, B3 and B4 of adder 75 14 by decimal 2. When the binary count from counter 75 16 is equal to decimal 9 to decimal 15, then neither the A equals B nor the A is less than B signal from comparator 75 18 is generated. The output signals from terminals St, S2, S3 and S4 represent a binary count which is the input binary count applied to terminals Bi, B2, B3 and B4 from counter 75 16 incremented by decimal 2 when the binary count from terminals QA, QB, QC and QD is from decimal 0 to decimal 7. The output binary count from terminals S1, S2,S3 and S4 of adder 75 14 equals the input binary count to terminals B1, B2, B3 and B4 of adder 75 14 when the binary count from terminals QA, QB, QC and QD is from decimal 8 to decimal 15. The RTS signal applied to NAND gate 75 36 remains at logical ONE for the receive operation. The A equals B signal is at logical ONE at the input terminal of NAND gate 75 36 when the binary count from counter 75 16 is from decimal 0 to decimal 7 and decimal 9 to decimal 15. Therefore, whenever the data bit signalRCVGATE is applied to the input terminal of NAND gate 75 36 and the binary count output of counter 75 16 is from decimal 0 to decimal 7, then signal CTRLD is forced to logical ZERO initiating the load operation of counter 75 16 on the next rise of the 12 MHz clock signal from inverter 75 40. This results in the binary count from decimal 2 to decimal 9 being loaded into counter 75 16. If the binary count stored in counter 75 16 was a decimal 6, then decimal 8 would be loaded into counter 75 16. When the data bit signal RCVGATE is applied to theNAND gate 75 36 and the binary count output of a counter 75 16 is from decimal 9 to decimal 15, then the load operation is again initiated by signal CTRLD. In this case, the output binary count from adder 75 14 which equals the input binary count to adder 75 14 is loaded into counter 75 16. This repeats the binary count output of counter 75 16 for two cycles of the 12 MHz clock from inverter 75 40. When the data bit signal RCVGATE is applied to theNAND gate 75 36 when the binary count output from counter 75 15 is decimal 8, then the A equals B signal from comparator 75 18 suppresses the load operation and the binary count in counter 75 16 proceeds normally. Note that the counter 75 16 will be adjusted to receive RCVGATE signals with a binary count of decimal 8 within eight or fewer successive RCVGATE signals. The data bit signal RCVGATE is applied to the K terminal of a flop 75 34 and to an AND gate 75 58 via an inverter 75 32. The QC output signal of counter 75 16 at logical ZERO enables a decoder multiplexer MUX 75 21.The QA and QB output signals of counter 75 16 are applied to the A and B input terminals of MUX 75 21. The QD output signal from counter 75 16 and a terminal Y1 output signal from MUX 75 21 are applied to the inputs of a NAND gate 75 26. The Y1 output signal from MUX 75 21 is at logical ZERO when the QB and QC output signals from counter 75 16 are at logical ZERO and the QA output signal is at logical ONE indicating a decimal 1 or decimal 9 count from counter 75 16. The OD output signal at logicalZERO applied to NAND gate 75 26 generates an ST1 signal at logical ONE indicating a decimal 1 output from counter 75 16.If the RCVGATE signal is applied to the K input terminal of a flop 75 34 and to an AND gate 75 58 via an inverter 75 32 when the output count of counter 75 16 is decimal 1, then the J input terminal is a logical ONE and the flop 75 34 sets on the fall of the 12 MHz clock signal forcing the receive data signal RXD to logical ONE. If signal RCVGATE is a logical ONE indicating a receive data bit with flop 75 34 set, then terminal K is at logical ONE and terminal J is at logical ZERO causing flop 75 34 to reset which forces the RXD signal to logicalZERO. Note that the RXD signal, once forced to logicalONE, remains at logical ONE during the normal receive mode until a RCVGATE signal at logical ONE is generated indicating a data bit. The QD output signal from counter 75 16 is inverted by an inverter 75 30 which generates the RXC signal. The communications controller 72 receives the RXC and RXD signals. The rising edge of the RXC signal clocks the data signal RXD in the communications controller 72 for sampling O data bits and 1 data bits. As shown in Figure 3B, the analog logic 76 and 78 generate UPA, UPB, DWNA and DWNB signals at logical ONE to generate nO data bits. Signals UPA, UPB, DWNA and DWNB remain at logical ZERO for 1 data bits. This system of coding is called bipolar modulation and insures that there is no direct current component in the pulse train. The forcing of a O bit after 5 successive 1 bits assures a transition and allows the receivers to resynchronize their clocks. The communications controller 72 uses the rise of theRXC clock signal to sample the state of the RXD signal.The RXD signal at logical ZERO indicates a 0 bit and theRXD signal at logical ONE indicates a 1 bit. Figure 3C shows the RCVGATE signals generated in the data recovery logic 75 upon receiving the UPA, UPB, DWNA and DWNB signals from analog circuits 76 and 78. During the transmit mode of operation, the communications controller 72 synchronizes the data stream with the data recovery logic 75 by receiving the transmit clock TXC signal which is generated by the QD output timing signal from counter 75 16. The communications controller 72 generates a request to send the RTS signal at logical ZERO which is applied to a negative AND gate 75 48 as well as NAND gate 75 36 as long as the communications controller has data to transmit. The RTS signal at logical ZERO applied to NAND gate 75 36 disables the counter 75 16 load operation, making it a free running counter. The transmit data bit signal TXD at logical ZERO is applied to the input of a negative AND gate 75 46 and negative AND gate 75 48. The output of negative AND gate 75 48 is applied to the J terminal of a strobe flop 75 44.Since the K terminal is at logical ZERO, strobe flop 75 44 sets on the fall of the RXC signal following the clock cycle in which the clear signal CLR is forced to logicalZERO, and the STROBE output signal at logical ONE is applied to analog circuits 76 and 78 via MUX 75 50. TheY3 terminal of decoder MUX 75 20 generates a state 3 and a state C signal when the binary count signal is at logicalZERO and the binary count signals QA and QB are at logicalONE. The Y3 terminal signal is applied to a NAND gate 75 24. The binary count signal OD at logical ZERO is applied to another input of NAND gate 75 24. The state 3 output signal and the 12 MHz clock signal are applied to respective inputs of a NAND gate 75 28. The output clear signal at logical ZERO assures that the flop 75 44 is reset at 3 time of counter 75 16. A decoder MUX 75 20 is enabled by the binary count QA signal from counter 75 16 at logical ZERO. Binary count signals QB and QC at logical ONE, applied to decoder MUX 75 20 terminals A and B respectively, generate a counter 75 18 state 6 and E signals from output terminal Y3 which is applied to an input of a negative NAND gate 75 22. The binary count QD signal at logical ZERO is applied to the other input of negative NAND gate 75 22. The output ST6 signal at logical ZERO is applied to the other input ofNAND gate 75 46 causing a polarity flop 75 42 to toggle on the fall of the 12 MHz clock signal, since both the J andK inputs are at logical ONE. Flop 75 42 is a logic element which toggles, that is if set, it resets or if reset, it sets on the fall of the 12 MHz clock signal with both the J and K terminals at logical ONE.The POLARITY signal indicates to the analog circuits 76 and 78 to reverse the polarity of this data bit received over theSTROBE signal line from the previous data bit received over the STROBE signal line. Note that only nO bits are toggled n 1 n bits have no effect on the flop 75 42. Figure 5 shows a timing diagram of the receive mode of operation wherein the data is received on time at 8 time , early at 114 time and late at 9 time. Figure 5A shows a bit sequence, binary 0100, received from analog circuits 76 or 78. Analog circuits 76 generate signals UPA and DWNA, and analog circuits 78 generate signals UPB and DWNB. Assuming the data stream is generated by analog circuits 76, then the UPA signal A generates the RCVGATE signal A to indicate the first binary ZERO. The DWNA signal B generates RCVGATE signal B to indicate the second binary ZERO, and the UPA signal C generates RCVGATE signal C to indicate the third binaryZERO. Note that there is no transition in the cycle between the first and second binary ZERO s, indicating a binary ONE. In Figure 5, the data on time mode shows RCVGATE signals A, B and C during the first, second and fourth cycles. There are 16 time slots per cycle, each time slot.having a duration of 83 nanoseconds. Each cycle has a duration of 1.3 microseconds, starts at the beginning of time slot 0 and ends at the end of time slot F. Data bits, therefore, are received at the rate of 750,000 bits per second. The receive clock RXC signal which rises at the start of the 0 time slot and falls at the start of the 8 time slot is applied to the communications controller 72 for synchronization with the data recovery logic 75. TheRCVGATE signal generates the receive data signal RXD which falls at the start of the 9 time slot and rises at the start of the next 2 time slot and which is applied to the communications controller 72 which uses the rising edge of the RXC signal to sample the RXD data signal. Note that the RCVGATE signals A, B and C are received at 8 time . When the data is received early, the data recovery logic 75 advances the time slot in which each successive data binary ZERO bit is received until the data bits are received at 8 time. The RCVGATE signal A is received during the 4 time slot. Since this is received early, the counter 75 16 is incremented by 2 and the 6 time slot follows the 4 time slot. The RCVGATE signal B is received during the 5 time slot. Since this is still early, the counter 75 16 is again incremented by 2 to stop the 6 time slot.The RCVGATE signal C is received during the 6 time slot and the counter 75 16 again is incremented by The fourth RCVGATE signal not shown would be received during the 7 time slot and the fifth RCVGATE signal not shown would be received during the 8 time slot putting the data recovery logic 75 in synchronization with the analog circuits 76 and 78. The receive clock RXC signal as described supra falls at the beginning of the 8 time slot and rises at the beginning of the 0 time slot. The receive data RXD signal falls at the fall of the RCVGATE signal and rises at the start of the following 2 time slot. When the RCVGATE signal is received late, the counter 75 16 is loaded with its output count by adder 75 14.RCVGATE signal A is received during the A time slot. Note that the next time slot is also an A time slot. RCVGATE signal B is received 16 time slots later during time slot 9. Time slot 9 repeats and RCVGATE signal C is received 16 time slots later at time slot 8 synchronizing data recovery logic 75 to the data bit stream from analog circuits 76. The receive clock RXC signal and the receive data signals are timed as described supra. Figure 6 is a timing diagram of the transmit data operation. The request to send RTS signal is forced low by the communications controller 72 indicating that the communications controller is ready to transmit data bits to the data recovery logic. The transmit clock TXC signal from the data recovery logic synchronizes the communications controller 72 to the timing of the data recovery logic 75. The data recovery logic 75 receives the data bit TXD signal which goes low at the start of the 2 time slot and rises at the start of the following B time slot for each binary ZERO bit. The data bit TXD signal stays high for each binary ONE bit. The data bit TXD signal stays high during successive cycles in which the data received is a string of binary ONE bits. The STROBE signal indicating binary ZERO bits A and C when low and a binary ONE bit B when high is applied to the analog circuits 76 and 78 along with the POLARITY signal which indicates whether the binary ZERO bit pulse is a positive voltage pulse or a negative voltage pulse as shown in Figure 6A. The POLARITY pulse, therefore, alternates on binaryZERO pulses, being high for binary ZERO pulse A, low for binary ZERO pulse C, high for binary ZERO pulse D, and so on. There is no change on the POLARITY signal for binaryONE pulses. Note that the POLARITY signal is high for both binary ZERO pulse A and binary ONE pulse B. The receive and transmit logic is tested within the data recovery logic 75 during a WRAP mode of operation in.which the communications controller 72 generates a test pattern of transmit data bit TXD signals which are translated into STROBE and POLARITY signals. The STROBE and POLARITY signals are applied to the B terminals of MUX 75 50 for storage in registers 75 10 and 75 12. TheRCVGATE signal is generated and synchronizes the binary count of counter 75 16 to the data bit stream and also generates the receive data bit RXD output signal from flop 75 34 as described supra. Microprocessor 30 generates status signals SO, S1 and S2 which are applied to the bus controller 38 which generates the IOWC signal. Microprocessor 30 also generates address signals A4, AS, A6 and A7 at logicalZERO. A decoder 75 70 is enabled by address signal A7 at logical ZERO and decodes address signals A4, AS and A6 at logical ZERO to generate signal WRAP 1 from output terminal 0. The microprocessor 30 generates data signal D4 at logical ONE which is applied to the D input of a flop 75 74. Signals IOWC and WRAP 1 at logical ZERO applied to a negative AND gate 75 72 generate a clock signal to set flop 75 74. The output signal WRAP 2 is applied to a select terminal of MUX 75 50 thereby selecting the B input terminals.Signal RTS at logicalZERO conditions the transmit logic in data recovery logic 75 to be responsive todthe transmit data bit TXD signal to set flops 75 42 and 75 44 for generating the STROBE andPOLARITY signals. The UPA and UPB signals are simulated by the POLARITY signal from flop 75 42 and the STROBE signal from flop 75 44 being applied to an AND gate 75 6.The DWNA and DWNB signals are simulated by the POLARITYand STROBE signals applied to an AND gate 75 8. The output of AND gate 75 6 or 75 8 is stored in flop 75 10 or 75 12 which generates the RCVGATE signal via NAND gate 75 52 or 75 54 and negative OR gate 75 56. The operation continues as in the receive mode as described supra. Referring to Figure 7, the firmware routines that control the HSLC 12 operation are stored in PROM 46,Figure 2. Static RAM 48 provides firmware workspace during the execution of firmware programs by microprocessor 30. The communication control 32 operates in a half duplex mode, that is it either transmits a full frame of information to the work stations 16 17 to 16 48, Figure 1, by processing a transmit initialization firmware routine, or receives a full frame of information from the work stations 16 17 to 16 48 by processing a receive initialization routine, Figure 8. Both the transmit and receive initialization routines load assigned address locations in static RAM 48 with interrupt vectors.These interrupt vectors serve as starting address locations of firmware routines which enable microprocessor 32 to process the interrupts. During the transmit mode, the assigned address locations are loaded with interrupt vectors to processor transmit interrupts and during the receive mode the assigned address locations are loaded with interrupt vectors to process receive interrupts. The communications controller 72, Figure 4, includes logic for two identical controller channels, channel A and channel B, each consisting of a transmitter section and a receiver section. Each control channel also includes 8 control and 2 status registers 72 2A and 72 2B which are loaded by the transmit or receive initialization firmware routines with information for controlling the respective transmit or receive operation. In addition, a third status register S2B is associated with control channel B. Control registers OA and OB store frequently used commands and register pointer control information. Control registers C1A and C1B store interrupt control information. Control registers C2A and C2B store microprocessor 30 bus controller 38 control information. Control registers C3A and C3B store receiver control information. Control registers C4A and C4B store mode control information. Control registers C5A and C5B store transmitter control information. Control registers C6A and C6B store sync address character information. Control registers C7A and C7B store sync character information. Status registers SOA and SOB store buffer and external status information including buffer overflow information. Status registers S1A and S1B store received character error and special condition status information. Status register S2B stores interrupt vector information. The transmit initialization routine is started in block 1167 by the microprocessor 30 assigning the interrupt vectors in address locations in static RAM 48.These interrupt vectors are used as starting address locations of firmware routines for microprocessor 32 to process communications controller 72 various receive, operation and transmit operation interrupts. The communications controller 72 generates an INTERRUPT signal via an inverter 72 2 which is applied to microprocessor 30 which sends back an interrupt acknowledge signal INTERRUPTACK via bus controller 38. Block 1171 resets the communications controller 72 by branching to a reset firmware routine which results in the microprocessor 30 sending a control word to control register 0 of channels A and B via data register 42 signals DO to D7 which contains a channel reset command. Address signal A8 applied to communications controller 72 selects channel A or channel B and address signal A7 defines the DO to D7 signals as a data byte or a command byte. Block 1175 1182 configures the interface between bus controller 38 and communications controller 72 by loading control register 2 channel A of communications controller 72 to indicate if channel A or B is used in a direct memory access DMA mode or in a non DMA mode where transfers are performed by CPU 4 in either polled, interrupt or block transfer modes. Also, the relative priorities of the various interrupt and DMA conditions are defined as well as how the communications controller 72 responds to an interrupt acknowledge sequence from microprocessor 30. Block 1186 1189 loads control register 2 of channel B of communications controller 72 with the interrupt vector to which microprocessor 30 will respond if no higher interrupt vector level is received by microprocessor 30. Block 1193 1196 loads control register 4 of channel A with information putting communications controller 72 in a synchronous mode SDLC wherein the clock is set at the data bit rate and no parity bit is transferred. Block 1203 1206 loads control register 1 of channelsA and B with information to indicate to the communications controller 72 under which conditions to issue an interrupt. As an example, an interrupt occurs on transmit buffer empty. This would result in an interrupt for every byte. Block 1227 1235 loads register 5 of channel A with information defining the transmit parameters such as which cyclic redundancy check CRC formulate to use and defining the number of bits per character. Block 1240 1243 loads register 0 of channel A with information to reset the transmit CRC checking logic. The transmit frame operation starts in block 677 877 wherein the address of the first character of the frame is loaded into an AL register of microprocessor 30. The first byte is read from dynamic RAM 52 at the address specified by the contents of register AL and stored in theBL register of microprocessor 30 for transfer to the communications controller 72. Block 694 699 transfers the remaining byte of the frame from dynamic RAM 52 to communications controller 72. Block 708 711 generates an external status change interrupt signifying the frame is sent to the work stations by the communications controller 72 and the CRC bytes generated by the communications controller 72 are sent. Block 713 halts the transmission with the transmit buffer empty interrupt enabled which results in a branch to process the end of the frame interrupt. Block 2183 2196 sets the transmit done flag and returns to the background task. Block 731 returns to the background task and tests for the successful transmission of the frame including theCRC bytes. The transmit done flag at binary ONE indicates that the transmit operation is complete. The receive initialization firmware routine starts in block 1265, Figure 8, by storing the interrupt vectors in the address locations of static RAM 48 thereby replacing the interrupt vectors stored during a previous information frame transfer. Block 1267 resets the communications controller 72 by branching to the reset firmware routine as described supra in block 1171. Block 1272 1277 configures the interface between bus controller 38 and communications controller 72 by loading control register 2 channel A and channel B of communications controller 72 as in block 1175 1182 described supra. In addition, the watchdog timer on channel B is initialized. The watchdog timer is set to initiate an interrupt if this receive operation being processed is not completed within a predetermined time.The microprocessor 30 is responsive to the interrupt to terminate this receive operation. Block 1292 1296 configures the communications controller 72 by loading control register 4 channel A with information putting the communications controller 72 in anSDLC mode wherein the clock is set at the data bit rate and no parity bit is received. Block 1308 1316 sets the interrupt parameters by loading control register 1 of channels A and B. These parameters define the conditions under which the, communications controller 72 will issue an interrupt. Block 7320 1352 defines the receive address character by loading control register 6 channel A with the address location of dynamic RAM 52 into which the first receive byte is stored. Block 1356 1360 loads control register 7 channel A with the start of frame character 01111110 . The communications controller 72 compares all information received with the start of frame character stored in control register 7 channel A. Block 1364 1367 loads control register 3 channel A with information to start the receive operation. The contents of control register 3 channel A defines the character as an 8 bit byte, enables the CRC logic and places the communications controller 72 into the address search mode for transferring the address location stored in control register 7 channel A to dynamic RAM 52 for loading the first device address byte received by the communications controller 72. Block 1372 1375 loads control register 5 channel A with information to select the CRC polynominal used by the communications controller 72 for checking the frame received. Block 891 893 loops on status register 0 channel A for an indication of a byte received by the communications controller 72. When the byte is received, then block 897 stores the byte in the address location of dynamic RAM 52 specified by the contents of control register 7 channel A. Block 916 926 interrupts the microprocessor 30 to indicate that the first byte has been received thereby preventing the microprocessor 30 from interrupting the communications controller 72 during the time required to receive the remainder of the frame. Block 950 953 loops to receive the remaining bytes of the frame until the end of frame character is received.The end of SDLC frame bit in status register 2 channel A indicates that the end of frame character has been received and that the CRC is valid. This results in a branch to block 2113 2127. Block 2113 2127 reads status register 0 channel A in order to capture current status and and resets the external status interrupt and increments a flag indicating that an abort sequence 8 or more 1 s has occurred or a synchronization change has occurred. Block 960 970 is entered if block 950 953 indicates an overflow condition, that is more than one frame of information processed, and branches to an abort firmware routine. Block 988 processes any abort error and returns to the background firmware routine to await the next receive or transmit request. The analog circuit 76 is made up of a transmitter 76 100, Figure 9, and a receiver 76 101, Figure 10.Referring to Figure 9, the analog circuit 76 receives thePOLARITY and STROBE signals representative of the data being transferred from the HSLC 12 to the work stations 16 17 to 16 32, Figure 1, via coaxial bus 12 1 and strobes them in order to reduce the reflections on the coaxial bus 12 1. The reflections would tend to reduce the amplitudes of the signals and also cause spurious signals thereby reducing the reliability of the system. The STROBE signal is received from data recovery logic 75 by the transmitter 76 100 and turns a transistor Q1 76 12 on via an inverter 76 2 and the divider network of resistors R1 76 14 and R2 76 58 normally the base of Q1 76 12 is high via the divider network of resistors R5 76 6, R4 76 4, R2 76 58 and R1 76 14 to 12 volts. TheSTROBE signal when high is inverted by inverter 76 2 and drives the base of Q1 76 12 low, turning on the transistor. Transistor Q1 76 12 is a constant current source which charges up a capacitor C1 76 18 to 6.2 volts. The output of C1 76 18 is clamped to 6.2 volts by a zener diode D1 76 20 and a diode D2 76 22 to ground. When the STROBE signal goes low, Q1 76 12 turns off and a transistor Q2 76 8 turns on, discharging C1 through a resistor R6 76 10 and Q2 76 8. The result is that theSTROBE signal appears as a trapezoidal shaped signal at the base of transistor Q3 76 30 and Q4 76 40. The trapezoidal shaped signal has approximately a 200 nanosecond rise time and a 200 nanosecond fall time. The zener diode D1 76 20 keeps the amplitude precisely at 6.2 V. Note that when the STROBE signal goes low, the output of inverter 76 2 is high and current is fed into the base of Q2 76 8 through R1 76 14 and R2 76 58 and R4 76 4. Resistor R5 76 6 stabilizes the current through Q2 76 8 by shunting the base. The output signals from Q3 76 30 and Q4 76 40 are applied to the opposite terminals of the primary winding of a center tapped transformer 76 46. The POLARITY signal from data recovery logic 75 is applied to the base of Q3 76 30 through an inverter 76 24 and to the base of Q4 76 40 through inverters 76 56, and 76 36. When the POLARITY signal is high, the output of inverter 76 24 shorts the base of Q3 76 30 to ground, turning Q3 76 30 off. When the POLARITY signal is high, the base of Q4 76 40 has a high impedance. This allows the signal through resistor R7 76 28 to be applied to the base of Q4 76 40. If this signal is the positive going triangular shaped waveform, that is it follows the voltage across C1 76 18, then the Q4 76 40 translates the voltage waveform into a current waveform which then flows from pin 4 to pin 3 of transformer 76 46. This signal is inverted across pins 7 and 8 of the secondary winding of transformer 76 46. When the POLARITY signal is low, the base of Q3 76 30 is high and the voltage across C7 76 18 is translated through resistor, R8 76 26 and Q3 76 30 into a current waveform which is applied from pin 1 to pin 2 of the primary winding of transformer 76 46 and across pins 7 and 8 of the secondary winding not inverted. The output signal from transformer 76 46 is applied to coaxial connector 76 48 for transfer down coaxial buses 12 1 and 12 2, Figure 1, to the work stations 16 17 to 16 48.Diodes D3 76 44 and D4 76 42 prevent Q3 76 30 and Q4 76 40 from conducting on negative going signals applied to the collector when the power supply is off. Resistors R26 76 50 and R27 76 52 in parallel with capacitors C10 76 54 provide for an RF signal ground for the coaxial connector 76 48 outer shield and at the same time isolates the DC and power supply frequencies from ground to prevent shock hazard that is, 60 Hz power applied to the shield of the coaxial connector 76 48 will have 300K ohms to ground and any RF signal will be shunted to ground by the .001 microfarad capacitor 76 54 thereby preventing electrical interference. Resistors R9 76 32 and R10 76 38 translate the voltage applied to the base of Q3 76 30 and Q4 76 40 to current levels. Resistor R11 76 34 is a pull up resistor for the output of inverter 76 58 which is an open collector device. The timing diagram of Figure 9A shows the signal on the coaxial buses 12 1 and 12 2 when the STROBE signal generates a positive going pulse and the POLARITY signal is high or low. The ramp rise and fall times are 200 nanoseconds each, the dwell time is 800 nanoseconds, and the bit cell time is 1333 nanoseconds 750,000 bits per second . The receiver 76 101 receives signals from work stations 16 17 to 16 48 of Figure 1, coaxial bus 12 1, coaxial connector 76 48, secondary winding pins 7 and 8 of transformer 76 46,, primary winding pins 1 and 2, and primary winding pins 3 and 4. Referring to Figure 10, the signal from pin 1 of transformer 76 46 is applied to terminal 2 of a comparator 76 35 through a capacitor C2 76 1 and a resistor R12 76 15. The signal from pin 4 of transformer 76 46 is applied to pin 2 of a comparator 76 39 through a capacitorC3 76 3 and a resistor R13 76 65. A threshold voltage is applied to pin 3 of comparators 76 35 and 76 39 through the divider network between 12 volts and ground of resistors R14 76 5, R15 76 7 and R16 76 9 and resistors R17 76 13 and R19 76 19. When the signal applied to pin 2 of comparator 76 35 is greater than the threshold voltage on pin 3, then an output signal appears on pin 7. The output signal is adjusted to a logic level by the divider network from 12 V, and resistor R22 76 43, diodes D5 76 45, D6 76 47,D7 76 49, and resistor R24 76 51 to ground. The output signal UPA is applied to OR gate 75 2, Figure 4. Similarly, when the signal applied to pin 2 of comparator 76 39 is greater than the threshold voltage applied to pin 2, then an output signal appears on pin 7.The output signal is adjusted to a logic level by the divider network from 12 V, and resistor R23 76 53, diodes D8 76 55, D9 76 57, D10 76 59 and resistor R25 76 61 to ground. The output signal DOWNA is applied to OR gate 75 4 of Figure 4. In addition when power is on, transistor Q5 76 37 is turned on and supplies the 12 volts to pins 5, 6 and 8 of comparators 76 35 and 76 37. The internal circuits go to ground through pins 1 and 4 and diode D11 76 41. When power is off, transistor Q5 76 37 is turned off and acts as a diode which with diode D11 76 41 blocks any signal applied to pin 2 of comparators 76 35 and 76 39 from ground, thereby preventing the clamping of any signal over the coaxial bus 12 1. Capacitors C2 76 1 and C3 76 3 block DC voltages from the transmitter. Resistors R12 76 15 and R13 76 65 in conjunction with capacitors C4 76 23 and C5 76 21 eliminate extraneous noise. Resistors R17 76 13 and R18 76 11 create the proper bias levels on input terminal 2 of comparators 76 35 and 76 37. Resistors R19 76 17 and R20 76 19 limit the voltage offset of the comparators 76 35 and 76 37. In addition, capacitors C6 76 25 and C7 76 27 are AC bypass capacitors which in conjunction with resistors R19 76 17 and R20 76 19 keep the threshold voltage stable. Capacitors C8 76 33 and C9 76 31 are speed up capacitors which provide positive feedback to insure fast switching and prevent oscillations of comparators 76 35 and 76 39. Each of the work stations 16 17 to 16 48 includes similar analog circuits for generating trapezoidal data signals for transfer over the coaxial buses 12 1 and 12 2 to the HSLC 12. Figure 11 shows details of coaxial bus 12 1 which couples work stations 16 17 to 16 32 to the HSLC 12.Work stations 16 33 through 16 48 are coupled to the HSLC 12 by coaxial bus 12 2 which is identical to coaxial bus 12 1. Each of the work stations 16 17 to 16 32 is coupled to the coaxial bus 12 1 by a BNC TEE 12 4 and a length of single conductor coaxial bus no greater than 3m in length. A length of greater than 3m will result in a reduced signal due to reflections. The cable length between adjacent BNC TEE s must also be greater than 9m to avoid a reduced signal due to reflections. Both ends of the coaxial bus 12 1 are terminated in a 75 ohm resistor between the shield which is grounded and the conductor to reduce reflections. The loopback firmware shown in Figure 12 controls theHSLC 12 in performing the loopback test, that is, verifying that the HSLC 12 logic shown in Figure 4 is operative. This test is performed independently of the work stations 16 17 to 16 45 of Figure 1. Block 1460 1462 sets the wrap flop 75 74 of Figure 4 by generating address signals All to A7 which are applied to a decoder 75 70. Address signals A4 to A7 at logical ZERO generate signal WRAP 1 which sets flop 7574 through a negative AND gate 75 72 when data signalD4 is at logical ONE and command, signal IOWC W OR from bus controller 38 is at logical ZERO. Output signal WRAP 2 from flop 75 74 selects the B input terminals of MUX 75 50. During the normal transmit operation, the outputs of the STROBE flop 75 44 and the POLARITY flop 75 42, signalsSTROBE and POLARITY , are applied to analog circuits 76 and 78. During the loopback test, the STROBE signal is applied to an input of AND gates 75 6 and 75 8, thePOLARITY signal is applied to an input of AND gate 75 6, and the POLARITY signal is applied to an input of AND gate 75 8. The STROBE signal inputs to analog circuits 76 and 78 are grounded through a B terminal of MUX 75 50. Block 1463 calls the initialization procedure by putting the communications controller 72 into the asynchronous mode. This permits the communications controller 72 to operate in a transmit receive mode a byte at a time, that is, transmitting, receiving and checking the byte. Block 1464 initializes the communications controller 72 in preparation for sending bytes which include a single binary ONE bit shifted one bit position on successive bytes. Block 1498 1500 sets the timeout count and disables the interrupts. The timeout count will indicate a failure in the logic and cause a branch to a process error routine block 1514 1531 . Disabling the interrupts suspends work stations 16 17 to 16 48 operation for the duration of the loopback test. Decision block 1504 1510 tests if the communications controller 72 is ready to accept a character from microprocessor 30 by testing the transmit buffer empty flag bit in an internal status register of the communications controller 72. If the transmit buffer remains full, then block 1511 1513 indicates a timeout condition and block 1511 1513 branches to a process error routine. If the transmit buffer empty flag indicates that the buffer is empty, then in block 1520 1521 the microprocessor 30 transfers a byte D0 D7 to communications controller 72. Decision block 1522 1526 loops on itself through error timeout block 1527 1529 until the receiver portion of the communications controller 72 is ready to receive the test byte. If no byte is received during the timeout period, the firmware branches to the process error routine, block 1514 1541. Block 1535 1542 receives the byte which was transmitted from communications controller 72, flops 75 42 and 75 44, AND gates 75 6 and 75 8, MUX 75 50, registers 75 10 and 75 12, negative OR gate 75 56, and flop 75 34 to communications controller 72 via signal RXD. Also, counter 75 16, adder 75 14, comparator 75 18 and decoderMUX s 75 20 and 75 21 cooperate as described supra to adjust the timing of the logic to the data bytes. The byte is transferred to the microprocessor 30 and verified against the transmitted byte. Block 1541 1542 forms the next test byte in the microprocessor 30. Decision block 1543 checks the number of bytes transmitted and exits in block 1547 1549 when eight bytes were received. If less than eight bytes were received, then the firmware branches to decision block 1504 1510 to test the next byte. Figure 11A shows a section of the single conductor coaxial bus which includes a receiving end, a sending end, a TEE connection , and a 3m stub length. The receiving and sending ends are terminated in nominal impedance R, and the stub is open circuited. Following is a simplified discussion relating to the amplitude of the reflections for step and ramp functions. Assume that a V1 step function signal is applied to the coaxial bus equation a, Figure 11A , that the impedances of the receiving end, the sending end and the stub are equal to R equation b , and that d equals the delay time of the step function signal from the TEE to the end of the stub equation c . Then p, the reflection coefficient, equals 1 3 equation d . Therefore, the value of the reflection V2 at time t equals Od is 1 3 the amplitude of the V1 step function and in the reverse direction equation e . The value of the reflection at time t equals 2d, that is, 2 lengths of the stub is 1 9 the amplitude of the V1 step function equation f . Now assume a ramp of amplitude V1 and duration 8d which may be approximated by two steps of amplitude 1 2 V1 and duration 4d equation g . Then the amplitude of reflection V2 at time t equals Od is 1 6 the amplitude of V1 equation h . Note that this reflection has died out before the end of time equals 4d so there is no effect on the second step of amplitude V 1 2. The amplitude of the reflection at time t equals 2d is 1 18 the amplitude of V1 equation i . As can be seen, the more steps the ramp waveform can be divided into in relation to d, the smaller the amplitude of the reflection since the reflection from one step dies out before the start of the next step. When additional stubs are attached to the coaxial bus, the reflections are reduced by keeping the distance along the coaxial bus between stubs at least 3 stub lengths or 9m apart, the reflections from one stub will die out before the reflections from the next stub can add to it. Figure 13 shows a block diagram of work stations 16 17 to 16 48 of Figure 1. The work station includes a microprocessor 16 68, a programmable read only memory PROM 16 66, a random access memory RAM 16 64, a communications controller 16 62, all coupled in common to an address and data bus. Also included are link I O circuits 16 50 and a CRT controller 16 70. A work station could include a printer controller 16 76 for controlling a printer 16 78. A cathode ray tube CRT display 16 72 and a keyboard 16 74 are coupled to the CRT controller 16 76. The microprocessor 16 68 controls the work station operation by the use of microprograms stored in the PROM 16 66. The microprocessor 16 68 generates address signalsADO to AD7 and A8 to A19 over bus 16 79 to address PROM 16 66 and reads the microinstructions over data signal lines ADO to ADT. Information entered into the work station via the keyboard 16 74 is stored in the RAM 16 64 and displayed on the CRT display 16 72.Information received from the HSLC 12 via the coaxial bus 12 1 or 12 2 is stored in RAM 16 64 via the link I O circuits 16 50 and communications controller 16 62.Serial data signals received by the link I O circuits 16 50 are shifted into a receive shift register 16 56 and then transferred into a first in first out FIFO receive buffer register 16 58 for storage in RAM 16 64. The HSLC 12 polls each work station in turn. The addressed work station responds if it has a block of information stored in RAM 16 64 by putting the block of information out on coaxial bus 12 1 or 12 2. The information is transferred from the RAM 16 64 to the communications controller 16 62 via transmit buffer register 16 52 and loaded into the transmit shift register for serial transfer to the HSLC 12 via the link I O circuits 16 50 and coaxial bus 12 1 or 12 2. The poll signals from the HSLC 12 include a flag character, an address character, a control character indicating a poll request, a cyclic redundancy check character and a closing flag character. The microprocessor 16 68 recognizes this as a poll request since the message received overflows the receive buffer register 16 58.The microprocessor 16 68 tests the communications controller 16 62 status registers described supra for the overflow and branches to a work station transmit microprogram not shown . Information transfers within the work station are controlled by the microprocessor 16 68. All activity within the communications controller 16 62 is under the control of a controller 16 60. Normally the microprocessor is operating in a background mode, performing such operation or querying the keyboard 16 74 via the CRT controller 16 70 and storing keyboard characters in RAM 16 64. Since the information received from the HSLC 12 is at 750,000 bits per second, a prepoll operation is necessary in order to condition the work station to receive a block of information. The HSLC 12 sends a flag character, a work station address, a cyclic redundancy check character and a flag character.This prepoll information gives the microprocessor 16 68 time to drop out of the background mode and branch using an interrupt vector to the microprogram routine in PROM 16 66 to be ready to receive the block of information. Figure 14 shows a flow diagram of the prepoll microprogram stored in the PROM 16 66, Figure 13, of work stations 16 17 to 16 48. The prepoll microprogram conditions the work stations during the power on sequence to initialize the communications controller 16 62 and to set up the interrupt vectors in the microprocessor 16 68 in block 16 80. Then in block 16 81, the microprocessor 16 68 is operative to perform the necessary background tasks such as querying the keyboard 16 74 and updating theCRT display 16 72. Decision block 16 82 tests the communications controller 16 62 to determine if a message having the particular work station address was received from the HSLC 12. If the message received includes a flag byte, the work station address, and the cyclic redundancy check byte followed by a flag byte indicating a prepoll, then the communications controller 16 62 sends an interrupt request over the WAIT line, Figure 13, to the microprocessor 16 68 immediately upon receiving the work station address, the microprocessor 16 68 then verifies that the remainder of the prepoll message was received correctly.The microprocessor 16 68 then branches to the microprogram that will process the message following the prepoll. If the address is not for this work station, then the communications controller 16 62 continues to search for the address that matches the work station address. Decision block 16 83 checks if there was a cyclic redundancy check routine and branches to block 16 84 to process the error. If there is no error, then block 16 85 conditions the communications controller 16 62 to receive information bytes from the HSLC 12. Decision block 16 86 tests the information byte received in the shift register 16 56 and transferred to the first in first out buffer register 16 58. If a byte is in the buffer register, then in block 16 85 microprocessor 16 68 stores the byte in RAM 16 64 and branches to decision block 16 86 to fetch the next byte.If there is no byte in the buffer 16 58, then decision block 16 87 tests if the closing flag was received. If not, the microprogram branches to decision block 16 86 to await the next byte. If the closing flag was received, then an interrupt occurs to get out of the receive character loop of blocks 16 86, 16 87 and 16 88. If the end of frame character was received, then decision block 16 89 performs the cyclic redundancy check and branches to block 16 84 if an error condition is sensed. The complete message received from the HSLC 12 is now stored in RAM 16 64. Decision block 16 90 queries the work station if a request response command is set and if set, the information is ready to send. If information is ready to send, then in block 16 93, under microprocessor 16 68 control, information is read from RAM 16 64 to the HSLC 12 via the transmit buffer register 16 52 to the transmit shift register 16 54 of the communications controller 16 62, the link I O circuits 16 50 and the coaxial bus 12 1 or 12 2. The work station then returns in block 16 94 to running the background microprograms. If decision block 16 90 indicates that the request response command is not set, then block 16 91 tests if there are other commands to be processed. Typical commands are transmit identification and disconnect from loop . When the commands are processed, the work station returns to block 16 94 to run the background programs.
