# Method and apparatus for ejecting droplets of ink.

## Abstract
An apparatus for ejecting droplets of ink comprising a pas sage for ink 2 an orifice 3 disposed at an end of the passage a pressure applying means 1 for applying a pressure wave to the ink within the passage and a signal supplying means for supplying an actuating signal to the pressure applying means. The frequency of the signal is such that the displacement of the ink surface due to the pressure wave at the orifice is max imized.
