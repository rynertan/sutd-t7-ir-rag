# Low voltage cable.

## Abstract
A heat resistant, non fire propagating, low voltage elec tric cable wherein the covering 2 of the conductor 1 is made of a compound, which is cross linked through irradia tion that, prior to this operation, comprises a base polymer, which is not cross linkable through irradiation, and mono mers that are polymerizable through irradiation.
