## Description
The present invention relates to a method and a composition for the determination of compounds having a mercapto group hereinafter referred to as SH compounds . With regard to the determination of SH compounds, the following methods have so far been known 1 titration method using organomercury compound such as p chloromercury benzoic acid, 2 colorimetric method using sodium nitroprusside and 3 colorimetric method using Ellman s reagents such as 5,5 dithio bis 2 nitrobenzoic acid hereinafter referred to as DTNB . These methods have the following disadvantages. Method 1 uses organomercury compound, and is much susceptible to influences of living body components in a sample, when applied to clinical inspections, owing to the measurement in the ultraviolet region. In method 2 , colored reaction solution is unstable to change of temperature, and wavelength for measurement is low. In method 3 , wavelength for measurement is low. Thus, development of a method for the determination of SH compounds with higher accuracy is desired. As a result of studies to this end, it has been found that a pigment formed by reaction of a compound represented by the general formula I , as will be described later, with SH compound has a maximum absorption wavelength of about 600 nm and has distinguished characteristics such as less susceptibility to influences of components in a sample, particularly living body components possible measurement in the visible region good sensitivity possible determination of a small amount of a sample good solubility in water. According to the present invention, SH compounds can be determined by reacting the SH compound with a chromogen represented by the following general formula I hereinafter referred to as compound I wherein Y is hydrogen or hydroxyl R₁, R₂ and R₃ may be the same or different and are groups represented by the following general formula II , III or IV wherein Z all Z s being the same or different is hydroxyl, amino, substituted amino, alkyl, substituted alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, substituted aryl, acyl, halogen atom, nitro, sulfo, carboxyl or alkoxy n is 0, 1, 2, or 3 provided that at least one Z in R₁, R₂, and R₃ is hydroxyl, amino or substituted amino, in the presence of peroxidase, and by determining the pigment thus formed. In the foregoing definitions, the alkyl includes alkyl groups having 1 to 5 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, etc., the alkenyl includes alkenyl groups having 2 to 5 carbon atoms such as vinyl, propylene, butylene, etc., and the alkoxy includes alkoxy groups having 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, butoxy, etc. The aryl is exemplified by phenyl and naphthyl. The acyl includes acyl groups having 2 to 5 carbon atoms, such as acetyl, propionyl, butyryl, etc., and the halogen includes a chlorine atom, a bromine atom and a fluorine atom. The substituent in the substituted amino, substituted alkyl, and substituted aryl is exemplified by alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, alkoxy, hydroxyl, carboxyl, sulfo, sulfonyl, halogen atom, amino, alkoxycarbonylamino, alkoxycarbonyl, aminoalkyl, acyl, nitro, etc. The alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, alkoxy, halogen, acyl, etc. in the substituent have the same meanings as defined above. The SH compound which can be determined according to the present invention includes L cysteine, glutathione, coenzyme A hereinafter referred to as CoA , methanethiol, dihydrolipoamide and thiocholine. In carrying out the present invention, the peroxidase and compound I are generally added to a buffer solution, for example, Good s buffer, phosphate buffer, borate buffer, acetate buffer and Tris buffer to prepare a reagent solution. The reagent solution is added to a sample, and subjected to reaction at a temperature of 30 to 50 C at which the enzyme is not inactivated. Absorption of the reaction solution colored by the pigment thus formed is measured at the maximum absorption wavelength of the pigment in visible ray region on the basis of a reagent blank as a control, and SH compound in the sample is determined from a calibration curve obtained in advance by tests on known amounts of the factor to be determined. The present method can be applied to the determination of amount of a reactant or enzyme activity in a reaction system producing SH compound by the reaction described later. When the factor to be determined is a compound, the reaction is generally carried out for about 5 to 10 minutes before the absorption measurement, and the desired factor can be determined by colorimetrically measuring the absorption of the reaction solution. When the factor is an enzyme activity, a rate of pigment formation at an appropriate time after the start of reaction is generally determined from changes in the absorbance of reaction solution, whereby the activity can be determined. The buffer solution is used at a concentration of 10 mM of 1 M. The peroxidase is used at 1 to 500 U ml. Compound I is used at least in an equimolar amount to that of SH compound which reacts with compound I , and usually at 0.001 to 1 mg ml. In the reaction, the concentration of SH compound in a sample is usally adjusted to 0.001 to 1 mg ml by the reagent solution or distilled water. When the present invention is applied to a reaction system which produces SH compound, a reactant such as a substrate taking part in the reaction and an enzyme, are used generally at 0.0001 to 100 mg ml and 10 to 1000 U ml, respectively, though their amounts often depend on whether they are the objects to be measured or not. A surfactant such as Triton X 100, etc. can also be used, if required, to clear the solution of turbidity. Specific examples of compound I used in the present invention are shown in Tables 1 to 4 together with their maximum absorption wavelength λmax and sensitivity. Symbols in the Tables show the following groups, and in Tables 1 to 3, the number in parenthesis shows the position. Determination of sensitivity is carried out in the following manner Compound I is a compound known as an intermediate for dye synthesis, and the compounds listed in Tables 1 to 3 can be prepared in the following manner 4,4 bis dimethylamino benzhydrol is reacted with an equimolar amount of substituted benzene or substituted naphthalene given below in 2 to 10 fold amount of 60 sulfuric acid on the basis of the total starting compounds. The reaction is carried out at 50 to 100 C with stirring for 2 to 3 hours. Then, 5 to 6 fold amount of cold water of about 5 C is added to the reaction solution, and the mixture is stirred overnight. The reaction product is recovered therefrom by filtration washed with 8 sulfuric acid, and dried in vacuo, whereby the desired compound the group Y of which is hydrogen is obtained. The compound is hydrolized with alkali to obtain the desired compound, the group Y of which is hydroxyl. Well known pigments corresponding to the individual compounds in the following Table are used as starting compounds and dissolved in 80 fold amount of distilled water on the basis of the weight of the starting compounds. 2 fold amount of sodium boron hydride on the basis of the weight of the starting pigment is slowly added to the individual pigment solutions to conduct reduction reaction. After stirring at room temperature for about 2 hours, the reaction solutions are concentrated to dryness in a rotary evaporator. Then, dried residues are dissolved in a minimum necessary amount of distilled water for dissolving the dried residues. The solution is charged on the column packed with 15 to 20 fold volume of resin HP 20 on the basis of the solution. Then, 3 to 4 fold volume of distilled water on the basis of the resin used is passed therethrough to remove the remaining sodium boron hydride. At that time, the desired products remain as adsorbed on HP 20. Then, a developing solvent of methanol distilled water 1 1 is passed therethrough to recover the eluate in appropriate fractions. After the desired compound in the eluate is ascertained by UV monitor or by TLC, the fractions containing the compound are joined together, and concentrated to dryness, to obtain the desired compound, the group Y of which is hydrogen. The compound is hydrolized with alkali to obtain the desired compound, the group Y of which is hydroxyl.
