# Reinforcing structure for elastomeric article and article thereby obtained.

## Abstract
A flat reinforcing structure for elastomeric objects such as conveyer belts comprising a first series of parallel cords 2 covered on one side by a second series of parallel cords 3 which with respect to the first series are transversally disposed and whereby the cords are mutually connected at the intersec tions, whereby the tensile strength of the first series of cords per unit of width of the series amount to at least twice the ten sile strength of the second series of cords per unit of width, while the tensile strength of each cord of the first series amounts to at least once and at most ten times the tensile strength of each cord of the second series. The cords are pref erably steel cords.
