## Description
Apparatus for the realization of a process to remove nitrogen oxides from exhaust gasesThis invention refers to an apparatus for the realization of a process to remove nitrogen oxides from exhaust gases in that the hot exhaust gases are mixed up with gaseous ammonia or sprayable liquid ammonia passes through catalyst lattices, wherein the nitrogen oxides together with the ammonia are reduced to form gaseous nitrogen and water vapor.According to a known process of such type, the hot exhaust gases containing nitrogen oxides are brought up for continued handling of them via heat exchangers or after heaters to a temperature ranging between 250 and 450 C and mixed with the gaseous ammonia or sprayable liquid ammonia in a succeeding mixer to have a volume proportion of 1 1 be come off. This gas mixture is then directed through a metal or ceramic lattice of relatively great cross sectional diameters of passage, the surface of said lattice having been given a coating of stainless steel catalyst. The nitrogen oxides and ammonia react due to this catalyst, and the nitrogen oxides are reduced to form nitrogen and water vapor and blown off under radiation of the possibly existing excess heat, via the entry side heat exchanger.Control of the volume of ammonia fed into the mixer is performed by sensing elements which are to me.. asure either the nitrogen oxide contents of the entering exhaust gas or the contents of residual ammonia of the gas leaving the lattice or both contents altogether and to compare them with the desired constants. Although life of the stainless steel coating of the lattice may, according to the working conditions, last for a period of some months or of one year, manufacturing expenditure, prices of stainless steel and, as the case may be, regeneration of the lattice will surely constitute a considerable factor of cost for the estimation of benefits expected to be taken of this process, which will not fail to handicap its application to a large extent.Moreover, there is a well know process existing which in abandoning the expensive stainless steel coating of the lattices admits that the nitrogen oxides containing exhaust gases are directed through a series of molecular sieves, of which the cross sectional diameters of passage correspond to the critical molecular diameter of the nitrogen oxides.Therefore, the nitrogen oxides are retained in the molecular sieves, i.e. they are adsorbed, whereas the balance of the exhaust gases having been made free from nitrogen oxides may be blown off subsequëntly. Upon reaching the limits of its power of adsorption, the section of molecular sieves is switched off and the exhaust gases are bypassed onto a new section of molecular sieves ready to work. Then the switched off section must be blown off by means of hot water vapor, the resulting azotic acid be accumulated for being carried off for further handling.Irrespective of the fact that in the case of the said process azotic acid is produced instead of water and nitrogen, also prejudice will be caused in that first the limited power of adsorption of the molecular sieve section requires several sections of identical type to be arranged one after another in order to ensure continuous operation, in which case the consecutively arranged sections will additionally be charged to adsorb the nitrogen oxides having passed the preceding section and further, in that this process effectively operates only at relatively low temperatures of approx.40 50.at. Therefore, the exhaust gases will in any case have to be cooled down to the aforesaid temperatures.The thus appearing heat may, of course, be used for the preparation of hot vapor for the purpose of cleaning the sections of molecular sieves, but would as a result build up a very complex system consisting of numerous changeover control and regulating appliances. Additionally, residuals of nitric acid will unavoidably remain in the pores of the molecular sieves so that also these sieves would have to be renewed from time to time due to the fact that regeneration of them would not be feasible.It is the object of the invention to provide an apparatus for realizing the aforesaid principle of the process to have the apparatus be capable of ensuring a very long service life, if uniform removing power and adjustability of the admixture of ammonia without any use of stainless steel catalysts prevail. This task will be solved in that the catalyst lattice has been made to show a ceramic molecular sieve whose crosssectional diameters of passage are of size beneath the critical molecular diameter of ammonia upto above the critical molecular diameter of nitrogen and that the surface of the molecular sieve does not show any catalytic coating.The so designed apparatus causes the nitrogen oxides and ammonia to diffuse into the passing through cross section of the pores of the molecular sieve so that the aforesaid reaction will take place in their stress field causing gaseous nitrogen and water vapor to be generates, which together with the residual gase emerge from the molecular sieve section. An additional and beneficial effect resulting therefrom consists in that the carbon monoxide contained in the exhaust gases oxidizes in the course of the same phase of passage with oxygen to form carbon dioxide and that as a result the carbon monoxide together with nitrogen and water vapor are allowed to be blown off as an innoxious gas.Considering that the surface of the molecular sieves does not have any catalytic coating, there is also immunity of this surface ensured from catalytic poisons such as sulphur dioxide, carbon dioxide and water and there is nothing that may hinder utilization of these elements. in the presence of elevated oxygen concentrations upto 30 Vol. and more.The passing through cross sectional diameters of the molecular sieve may beneficially fluctuate between 2.5 and 4.0 Angström units. Moreover, it will be possible to.provide the surface of the sieve with a coating of noncatalytic material in order to improve the properties of low or to affect sizing of the cross sections of flow.The description hereunder gives more details of the embodiment of the invention as per the drawing attached The exhaust gases containing nitrogen oxides are fed via a fan 1 to the primar circuit 2a of a heat exchanger 2, .... .of which the secondary circuit 2b accomodates the exhaust air conduit 3 leading to the stack K. Behind the heat exchanger there is an after heater 4 located which starts its activity upon demand of the outlet temperature of the exhaust gas coming from the consuming equipment. From the after heater 4 the exhaust gas is supplied to a mixer 5 into which an ammonia supply line is fitted. The gas mixtures leaving the mixer enter the molecular sieve section 7, and the mixture itself consisting of oxygen, nitrogen, water vapor and carbon dioxide, if any, leaving said section is passed through the secondary circuit 2b of the heat exchanger 2 toward the stack K. Proportioning of the ammonia supplied to the mixer is achieved by means of the regulating device 8 which in turn starts working depending on the signals of the sensing element 9 having been arranged ahead of the mixer 5 or of the sensing element 10 arranged behind the molecular sieve section 7 or on the signals emanating from both sensing elements. Object of the sensing element 9 is to evaluate at the same time the share of nitrogen oxides in the exhaust gas, whereas the sensing element 10 evaluates the residual ammonia still existing in the gas mixture which leaves the molecular sieve section 7.
