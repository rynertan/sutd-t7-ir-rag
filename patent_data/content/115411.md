## Description
RIFLE ACTION RECEIVER This invention relates generally to firearms and, more particularly, to a method and apparatus for increasing the rigidity of a rifle action receiver and therefore, the accuracy of the rifle. It is well known that the lack of rigidity in a rifle action e.g., of the Mauser type is a serious limiting factor to ultimate rifle accuracy, and various methods haved been developed to strengthen, stiffen and stabilize the receiver. Unfortunately, each such method has involved the use of a custom receiver which, as a result of their generally larger exterior dimensions, are unduly heavy. This is undesirable since 1 in certain competitions there are limits on the weight of the weapon used and 2 the increased weight is extremely burdensome to hunters and other sportsmen who carry their rifles for long periods of time. It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and apparatus for increasing the rigidity of a pre existing commercial rifle action receiver, and a further object of the present invention is to provide a stabilizing apparatus for use in conjunction with a pre existing, commercially available rifle action receiver which includes a cartridge loading plate. According to a broad aspect of the invention, there is provided an apparatus for increasing the rigidity of a conventional, pre existing rifle action receiver of the type which includes a receiver port, having first and second longitudinal edges and front and rear edges, for receiving a cartridge magazine, an ejection port, a bolt which reciprocates within said receiver so as to engage a cartridge and urge it into a chamber at the rearward end of a barrel which is secured into a threaded opening in a front wall of said receiver, said apparatus comprising a first plate capable of being fixedly coupled along an edge thereof to said receiver proximate said first longitudinal edge and extending downward therefrom and a second plate capable of being fixedly coupled along an edge thereof to said receiver proximate said second longitudinal edge and extending downward therefrom. According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided an improved rifle action receiver of the type which includes a receiver port, having first and second longitudinal edges and front and rear edges, for receiving a cartridge magazine, an ejection port, a bolt which reciprocates within said receiver so as to engage a cartridge and urge it into a chamber at the rearward end of a barrel which is secured into a threaded opening in a front wall of said receiver, the improvement comprising a first plate fixedly coupled along an edge thereof to said receiver proximate said first longitudinal edge and extending downward therefrom a second plate fixedly coupled along an edge thereof to said receiver proximate said second longitudinal edge and extending downward and a third plate transversely coupled to and between said first and second plates. According to a still further aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for increasing the rigidity of a conventional pre existing rifle action receiver of the type which includes a receiver port, having first and second longitudinal edges and front and rear edges, for receiving a cartridge magazine, an ejection port, a bolt which reciprocates within said receiver so as to engage a cartridge and urge it into a chamber at the rearward end of a barrel which is secured into a threaded opening in a front wall of said receiver, comprising coupling a first plate along an edge thereof to said receiver proximate said first longitudinal edge and extending downward therefrom and coupling a second plate along an edge thereof to said receiver proximate said second longitudinal edge and extending downward therefrom. According to yet another aspect of the invention there is provided an improved rifle action receiver of the type which includes a receiver port having first and second longitudinal edges and front and rear edges for receiving a cartridge magazine through an aperture in a single and continous stock, said aperture having first and second side surfaces, and receiver also including an ejection port, and a bolt which reciprocates within said receiver so as to engage a cartridge and urge it into a chamber at the rearward end of a barrel which is secured into a threaded opening in a front wall of said receiver, the improvement comprising first plate fixedly coupled along an edge thereof to said receiver proximate said first longitudinal edge and extending downward therefrom adjacent said first side surface and a second plate fixedly coupled along an edge thereof to said receiver proximate said second longitudinal edge and extending downward therefrom adjacent said second side surface. The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be better understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is an isometric view of a rifle action receiver in according with the invention Figure 2 is a side view of the receiver shown inFigure 1 Figure 3 is a cross sectional view of the rifle action receiver shown in Figures 1 and 2 taken along line 3 3 Figure 4 is a bottom view of the receiver shown inFigure 1 Figure 5 is a cross sectional view of a second embodiment of the rifle action receiver of the invention Figure 6 is an isometric partial view of a rifle of the single and continuous stock variety having therein a receiver in accordance with the invention and Figure 7 is a cross sectional view of the apparatus in Figure 6 taken along line 7 7. Referring to Figures 1 to 4, a rifle action receiver 10 includes an ejection port 12, a magazine port 14 having front and rear edges 16 and 18, respectively, and first and second longitudinal edges 20 and 22, respectively, and a threaded aperture 24 in a front wall 26 for receiving a barrel not shown having a chamber into which a cartridge may be urged by a reciprocally movable bolt not shown . A pair of spaced apart plates 28 and 30 are fixedly coupled to the underside of the receiver proximate edges 20 and 22, respectively, and extend downward therefrom in parallel forming relationship to each other. Plates 28 and 30 may be manufactured from, for example, steel, brass, titanium, aluminium, etc., and may be secured to the receiver by welding, brazing or soldering. Of course the plates may be formed integrally with the receiver during manufacture of the receiver. The plates may be generally trapezoidal in shape and may be formed by casting, forging or machining. It should be noted that with the exception of plates 28 and 30, Figures 1 to 4 illustrate a conventional commercially available receiver. It has been determined that by adding plates 28 and 30 in the manner described above, the vertical rigidity as calculated midway along the loading port may be increased as much as twenty seven times that which exists without the plates. That is, without the plates the rigidity was calculated to be 0.27 x 106. The addition of plates 28 and 30 raised the rigidity to 7.4 x 106. In both cases, calculations were made from the centerline that passes through the centre of the rifle bore. The plates used each weight approximately three ounces. Figure 5 is a cross sectional view of a second embodiment wherein the rigidity is even further increased due to a transverse lateral plate 32 fixedly coupled between vertical plates 28 and 30. Furthermore, by properly positioning plate 32, it serves as a loading platform such that a cartridge placed thereon will be engaged by the bolt and urged into the rifle s firing chamber. One of the distinct advantages of the receiver of the invention is illustrated in Figures 6 and 7. That is, when the inventive receiver is used in conjunction with a weapon having a single and continuous stock 34 and a trigger assembly 36, plates 2 and 30 may be inserted down through stock 34 and hidden thereby. The cartridge magazine 38 is then inserted between plates 28 and 30 as is shown in Figure 7. Thus, rigidity has been increased without detracting from the overall appearance of the weapon. Also seen in Figure 6 is barrel 40 engaged with threaded opening 24 and presenting firing chamber 42 at front wall 26.
