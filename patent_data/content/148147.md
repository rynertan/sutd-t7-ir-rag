# Process for para selective alkylation of aromatic hydrocarbons.

## Abstract
A process for the selective alkylation of monoalkylben zene into dialkylbenzenes wherein the para isomer of the disubstituted product is present in a concentration greater than in a thermodynamic equilibrium is provided. The method comprises passing the monoalkylbenzene and an alkylating agent capable of methylation, ethylation or propylation through a reaction zone containing an unmod ified crystalline silica catalyst of the silicalite type having the monoclinic symmetry.
