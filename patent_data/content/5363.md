## Abstract
Carboxyl containing polymers in the neutralized ionic form, of acrylic, methacrylic or maleic acid anhydrides, usually copolymerized with esters, amides or nitriles, and optionally with cross linking agents, are polymerized in non aqueous systems in solvents for the monomers which are non solvents for the resulting copolymers and the acid containing hydrophilic polymers thus obtained are neutralized to form an ionic salt, as with an alkali base such as NaOH dissolved or suspended in aliphatic alcohols containing less than 5 carbon atoms. By this technique the neutralization is conducted in the polymerization medium without isolating the free acid copolymers and a resulting slurry of uniform fine powder particles which are readily separated is obtained.

## Description
DESCRIPTION LI ETHANOL FOR C CARBOXYL CONTAINING POLYMERS III IN TOXIC WORK IN A DRY STATE. Carboxyl containing polymers containing substantial quantities of of carboxyl groups find utility in many applications. Such materials are described for example inU.S. Patent 2,798,053 directed to carboxylic polymers such as acrylic acid, maleic acid, the anhydrides, and the like, and copolymers with cross linking agents of polyalkenyl polyether of polyhydric alcohols containing more than one acrylic ester grouping per molecule and the alcohol containing at least 4 carbon atoms and at least 3 hydroxyl groups.Such magerials are insoluble in water and organic solvents and in the form of their salts absorb large quantities of water or solvents. Additional carboxyl type comonomers may be included in such copolymers including for example, methyl acrylate, hexylacrylate,and the like. Another useful class of carboxyl containing copolymers are those wherein the car boxylic acid monomers are copolymerized with acrylic esters containing 10 to 30 carbon ators, which in the salt for are efficient water thickeners. These materials are described in U.S. Patent 3,940,351.Another related and improved class of such carboxyl containing copolyluers are those that contain in addition to the carboxylic acid, a mixture of acrylic or methacrylic esters wherein one of the esters has alkyl groups containing 10 to 30 carbon atoms and in the other the alkyl group contains 1 to 8 carbon atoms, optionally with a cross linking agent. These materials are found to rapidly absorb and retain large quantities of water and ionic fluids. These materials are described in U.S.Patent 4,062,817. Other carboxylic polymers and copolymere such as those of acrylic acid, maleic acid, or the anhydrides also may be cross linked to provide useful materials with divinyl benzene, unsaturated diesters and the like and these are disclosed in U. S. Patents 2,340,110 2,340,111 and 2,533,635.These and sLirlilar related carboxyl containing polymers in nlany applications must be in the neutralized ionic form in order to function effectively. This is particularly so oE the acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, maleic acid and anhydried thcreof copolymers containing long chain alkyl acry la es copoiyrtrizc d therewith opLionally with cross lining monomers. The water thickening properties of most of these carboxyl containing polymers preclude neutralization to the neutralized ionic form with aqueous bases, although neutra lizaticn schemes have been suggested using ammonia or organic amines.The resulting products often have heat stability problems and therefore an improved method for preparing carboxyl containing polymers in neutralized ionic form is desired. Carboxyl containing polymers in neutralized ionic form are obtained by neutralizing carboxyl containing polymers in a nonaqueous slurry with an alkali base dissolved or suspended in a lower alcohol. The polymers include acrylic, methacrylic, or maleic acid or anhydride polymers, if in the form of copolymers, present in the amount of greater than 40 weight percent of acid, preferably copolymerized wit i alkyl acrylates containing 1 to 30 carbon atoms, optionally with mixtures of short and long chain alkyl acrylic esters, amides or nitriles and also optionally with cross linking agents. The carboxyl polymer slurry is normally obtained by polymerizing the copolymers in a solvent for the monomers which is substantially a nonsolvent for the resulting copolymers and neutralizing with a base in a lower alcohol.Also, the polymer may be isolated from the polymerization medium and redispersed in nonsolvent and reacted with the base. The improved process of the invention is particularly applicable where it is desirable and or necessary to obtain a dry or water free acid containing polymer in ionic form where isolation of such material from aqueous solutions would be difficult, extremely expensive, or impossible. Such materials normally will be high molecular weight polymers which form viscous masses on contact with water and will normally have weight average molecular weights from about 10,000 to greater than 1,000,000. The molecular weights of cross linking polymers may appear to be higher. The carboxylic monomers useful in the production of the polymers of this invention are the olefinicallyunsaturated carboxylic acids containing at least one activated carbon to carbon olefinic double bond, and at least one carboxyl group, that is, an acid containing an olefinic double bold which readily functions in polymerization because of its presence in the monomer molecule either in the alpha beta position with respect to a carboxyl group thusly, C C COOH, or as a part of a terminal methylene grouping thusly, CH2 C present in the copolymer in amounts from about 40 to 87 weight percent of the copolymer.In the alpha beta acids the close proximity of the strongly polar carboxyl groups to the double bonded carbon atoms has a strong activating influence rendering the substances containing this structure very readily polymerizable. The presence of a terminal methylene grouping in a carboxylic monomer makes this type of compound much more easily polymerizable than if the double bond were intermediate in the carbon structure.Olefinically unsaturated acids of this class include such widely divergent materials as the acrylic acids typified by acrylic acid itself, methacrylic acid, ethacrylic acid, alpha chloroacrylic acid, alpha cyano acrylic acid, beta methyl acrylic acid crotonic acid , alpha phenyl acrylic acid, beta acryloxy propionic acid, sorbic acid, alpha chloro sorbic acid, angelic acid, cinnamic acid, p chloro cinnamic acid, beta styryl acrylic acid 1carboxy 4 phenyl butadiene 1,3 , itaconic acid, citraconic acid, mesaconic acid, glutaconic acid, aconitic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, and tricarboxy ethylene. As used herein, the term carboxylic acid includes the polycarboxylic acids and those acid anhydrides, such as maleic anhydride, wherein the anhydride group is formed by the elimination of one molecule of water from two carboxyl groups located on the same polycarboxylic acid molecule. Maleic anhydride and the other acid anhydrides useful herein have the general structure EMI4.1 wherein R and R are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halogen and cyanogen t C N groups and alkyl, aryl, alkaryl, aralkyl, and cycloalkyl groups such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, octyl, decyl, phenyl, tolyl, xylyl, benzyl, cyclohexyl and the like. The preferred carboxylic monomers for use in this invention used in amounts of 40 to 87 weight percent total of the monomers polymerized are the monoolefinic acrylic acids having the general structureEMI4.2 wherein R is a substitutent selected from the class consisting of hydrogen, halogen, and the cyanogen CrN groups, monovalent alkyl radicals, monovalent aryl radicals, monovalent aralkyl radicals, monovalent alkaryl radicals and monovalent cycloaliphatic radicals. Of this class, acrylic and methacrylic acid are most preferred because of generally lower cost, ready availability, and ability to form superior polymers. Another useful carboxylic monomer is maleic anhydride or the acid. The acrylic ester monomers having long chain aliphatic groups are derivatives of an acrylic acid represented by the formulaEMI4.3 wherein R is an alkyl group having from 10 to 30 carbon atoms, preferably 10 to 20 carbon atoms and R is hydrogen or a methyl or ethyl group present in the copolymer in amount from about 2 to 20 weight percent, more preferably, about 5 to 15 weight percent. Representative higher alkyl acrylic esters are decyl acrylate, isodecyl methacrylate, lauryl acrylate, stearyl acrylate, behenyl acrylate and melissyl acrylate and the corresponding methacrylates.Mixtures of two or three or more long chain acrylic esters may be successfully polymerized with one of the carboxylic monomers to provide useful thickening resins of this invention. Particularly useful are those methacrylates where the alkyl group contains 12 to 21 carbon atoms present in amounts of about 5 to 15 weight percent of the total monomers. Outstanding polymers have been made with 15 5 weight percent isodecylmethacrylate, 10t3 weight percent lauryl methacrylate, 7 3 weight percent stearyl methacrylate. The other useful acrylic esters normally used with the long chain acrylic ester are also derivatives of an acrylic acid used in amounts of about 5 to 30 weight percent represented by the formula EMI5.1 wherein R is an alkyl, alkoxy, haloalkyl, cyanoalkyl, and like groups having from 1 to 9 carbon atoms and R is hydrogen or a methyl or ethyl group. These acrylic esters are present in the copolymer in amount from about 5 to 30 weight percent and more preferably from about 5 to 25 weight percent. Representative acrylates include methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, propyl acrylate, isopropyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, isobutyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, methyl ethacrylate, ethyl methacrylate octyl acrylate, heptyl acrylate, octyl methacrylate, isopropyl methacrylate, 2ethylhexyl acrylate, nonyl acrylate, hexyl acrylate, n hexyl methacrylate, and the like. Acrylic nitriles, a ss olefinically unsaturated nitriles useful in the interpolymers embodied herein may be used instead of or along with the short chain acrylic esters, are preferably the monoolefinically unsaturated nitriles having from 3 to 10 carbon atoms such as acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, ethacrylonitrile, chloroacrylonitrile, and the like. Most preferred are acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile. The amounts used are from about 5 to 30 weight percent of the total monomers copolymerized. Acrylic amides also may be used as the nitriles are and include monoolefinically unsaturated amides which may be incorFDrsted in the interpolymers of this invention having at least one hydrogen on the amide nitrogen and the olefinic unsaturation is a 8 to the carbonyl group. The preferred amides have the structureEMI6.1 Wherein R3 is a member of the group consisting of hydrogen and an alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms and R4 is a member of the group consisting of hydrogen and an alkyl group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Representative amides include acrylamide, methacrylamide, N methyl acrylamide, N t butyl acrylamide, N cyclohexyl acrylamide, Nethyl acrylamide and others.Very much preferred are acrylamide and methacrylamide used in amounts from about 5 to 30 weight percent of the total monomers copolymerized. Other acrylic amides include N alkylol amides of a,B olefinically unsaturated carboxylic acids including those having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms such as N methylol acrylamide, N ethanol acrylamide, N propanol acrylamide, Nmethylol methacrylamide, N ethanol methacrylamide, N methylol maleimide, N methylol maleamide, N methylol maleamic acid,N methylol maleamic acid esters, the N alkylol amides of the vinyl aromatic acids such as N methylol p vinyl benzamide, and the like and others. The preferred monomers of the Nalkylol amide type are the N alkylol amides of a,B monool efinically unsaturated monocarboxylic acids and the most preferred are N methylol acrylamide and N methylol methacrylamide used in amounts of about 5 to 20 weight percent. N alkoxymethyl acrylamides also may be used having the structure EMI7.1 wherein R is ele ted from the group consisting of hydrogen and met jl and R6 is an alkyl group having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms. It is thus intended that where references are made herein regarding the essential N substituted alkoxymethyl amides, the term acrylamide includes methacrylamide within its meaning. The preferred alkoxymethyl acrylamides are those wherein R is an alkyl group containing from 2 to 5 carbon atoms and useful is N butoxymethyl acrylamide. The carboxyl containing copolymers may be crosslinked in several ways.One is to use as comonomers polyalkenyl polyethers that contain more than one alkenyl ether grouping per molecule and those most useful possess alkenyl groups in which an olefinic double bond is present attached to a terminal methylene grouping thusly CH2 C . They are made by the etherification of a polyhydric alcohol containing at least 4 carbon atoms and at least 3 hydroxyl groups. Compounds of this class are readily produced, for example, by aWilliamson type synthesis, in which an alkenyl halide, or a mixture of such halides, such as allyl chloride, allyl bromide, methallyl chioride, methallyl bromide and others, is reacted with a strongly alkaline aqueous solution of one or more of the polyhydric alcohols. The product of such a synthesis usually is a complex mixture of polyethers containing varying numbers of ether groups on each molecule. Analysis of such materials, therefore, reveals only the average number of ether groupings on each molecule. These mixtures, however, if they analyze as containing an average number of ether groups per molecule greater than one, are capable of producing the insoluble carboxylic polymers of this invention. Since the efficiency of the polyether cross linking agent increases with the number of potentially polymerizable groups on the molecule, it is much preferred to utilize polyethers containing an average of two or more alkenyl ether groupings per molecule.The polyvinyl polyethers of the polyhydric alcohols. within the above broad class are produced by reacting acetylene with the polyhydric alcohol or an alcoholate thereof in a Reppe type vinylation snthesi, The polycrotyl ethers of the polyhydric alcohols al are useful although they do not contain a terminal CH2 C grouping. Illustrative polyhydric alcohols of the abovedescribed class that may be utilized in the preparation of the polyalkenyl polyether cross linking agent include the butane triols such as 1,2,3 butane triol, 2,3,4 trihydroxy butyric acid, the aldotetroses such as erythrose and threose, ketotetroses such as erythrulose the aldopentoses such as arabinose, xylose, lyxose, and ribose ketopentoses such as araboketose and xyloketose aldohexoses such as glucose, galactose, mannose, gluose, idose, talose, allose and the like ketohexoses such as fructose or levulose, sorbose and the like other sugars including the mono , di , tri and polysaccharides such as sucrose, maltose, lactose and raffinose the hexosans, pentosans and hexosan pentosans, the galactomannan and glucomannan gums, starch and others reduced forms of the above and other sugars and polysaccharides such as the so called sugar alcohols erythritol, xylitol, mono , di and tri pentaerythritol, arabitol, mannitol, iditol, tolitol, sorbitol, inositol, dulcitol, and others the oxidized derivatives of the sugars in which the oxidation has not been carried to the point where the original monosaccharide carbon chain unit is broken such as the monoand di carboxylic sugar acids including gluconic acid, glucuronic acid, galactonic acid, galacturonic acids, saccharic acid, mucic and pectic acids and other polyhydric alcohols of the class described. A preferred class of polyhydric alcohols for use in the production of the polyalkenyl polyether monomer are known as the oligosaccharides, which are defined as containing from one to four monosaccharide units. In addition to the oligosaccharides themselves, their reduction products such as the alcohols, aldo aicohols and their oxidation products which retain the original saccharide chain such as the sugar acids, the keto acids, the aldo acids and the like can be used. Illustrative saccharides of this class are the monozaccharide H crl as glucose, galactose, fructose, sorbose iiOS, and the like, disaccharides such as sucrose, arabinose, maltose, lactose, and the like, trisaccharides such as raffinose and others.Of these the disaccharide, sucrose, is much preferred because of its ready availability and its ability to produce polyethers of great reactivity with carboxylic monomers. The preferred cross linking monomer for use in preparing the copolymers, if one is employed, is a polyalkenyl polyether having more than one alkenyl ether grouping per molecule. The most useful possess alkenyl groups in which an olefinic double bond is present attached to a terminal methylene grouping, CH2 C . They are made by the etherification of a polyhydric alcohol containing at least 4 carbon atoms and at least 3 hydroxyl groups. It is preferred to utilize polyethers containing an average of two or more alkenyl ether groupings per molecule.Other crosslinking monomers include for example, diallyl esters, dimethallyl ethers, allyl or methallyl acrylates and acryla mides, tetraailyl tin, tetravinyl silane, polyalkenyl methanes, diacrylates and dimethacrylates, divinyl compounds as divinyl benzene, polyallyl phosphate, diallyloxy compounds and phosphite esters and the like. Typical agents are allyl pentaerythritol, allyl sucrose, trimethylolpropane triacrylate 1,6 hexanediol diacrylate, pentaerythritol triacrylate, tetramethylene dimethacrylate, tetramethylene diacrylate, ethylene diacrylate, ethylene dimethacrylate, triethylene glycol dimethacrylate, and the like. Allyl pentaerythritol and allyl sucrose provide excellent polymers in amounts less than 0.5 weight percent.Cross linking of the polymers provides improved ability for the copolymers to swell under a confining pressure. When the optional cross linking agent is present, polymeric mixtures containing about 0 to about 3 by weight of cross linking monomer based on the total of carboxylic acid monomer plus the alkyl acrylate ester monomers, and more preferably, 0.01 to 0.5 to 1.0 weight percent or phm. Other cross linking agents such as divinyl benzene unsatu. rtr diesters such as diallyl maleate or ethylene glycol dimethacrylate diallyl or divinyl ethers and others such as are disclosed in U.S. patents 2,340,110 2,340,111 and 2,533,635 may be used. Another method to obtain the desired cross linking is to use a comonomer which can react to yield cross links during polymerization. Examples are 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate and hydroxypropyl methacrylate, and the like.These units, when copolymerized, cross link by interchain esterification with carboxylic groups. For 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate, about 1 to 7 weight percent of monomers based on the total weight of monomers will provide a desired degree of cross linking. Another method of obtaining cross linked polymers is by reacting small amounts of a polyvalent base with the carboxyl containing polymer. Those materials which yield multivalent cations, for example, include calcium, magnesium, zinc, and aluminum. A mixed salt to be used would be one containing potassium or sodium ions with small amounts of calcium or aluminum ions, for example, to provide the multivalent cation to provide cross linking through polymeric carboxylic groups It will also be understood that small amounts of other x inylidene monomers, that is those copolymerizable monomers containing at least one terminal CH2 C group may also be include as a copolymerizable monomer with the essentia monomers so long as such monomers do not adversely affect the desired balance of water absorption and retention of the polymeric materials. Such materials include vinyl acetate styrene, vinyl pyrrolidone, methyl vinyl ether, ethyl vinyl ether, methyl vinyl ketone and the like in amounts less than about 10 weight percent of the polymer, normally less than 5 weight percent. While these polymers may be made in mass they normally will be prepared in liquid carriers normally organic solvents which do not dissolved or exesively swell the polymer to any appreciable extend.Good solubility of the monomers in such solvents or mixtures thereof is an advantage. Extremely polar solvents such as dimethyl formamide and dimethylsulfoxide have not been found to be preferred. Likewise, solvents which might participate in hydrogen bonding with the polymer such as tetrahydrofuran are not preferred. The most useful solvents have ben found to be aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene and the xylenes aliphatic hydrocarbons preferably having boiling pcints about room temperature, such as hexane, beptane, and the like esters such as ethyl acetate chlorine or halogen containing hydrocarbons and the like.The solvent preferably is less polar than acetone and is nonhydrogen bonding. The polymers of this invention are preferably made by polymerization in an inert diluent having some solubiliz ing action on one or more of he monomeric ingredients but substantially none on the resultant polymer. Polymeri ation in an organic liquid which is a solvent for the monomers but a nonsolvent for the polymer, or in a mixture of such solvents, in the presence of a solvent soluble catalyst is most preferred because the product is usually obtained as a very fine friable and often fluffy precipitate which, after solvent reraoval, seldom requires grinding or other treatment before use.Suitable solvents for the latter method include benzene, xylene, tctralin, hexane, heptane, carbon tetrachlor ide, methylene chloride, ethyl chloride, bromo trichloro ethane, dimethyl carbonate, diethyl carbonate, ethylene dichloride, and mixtures of these and other solvents. The polim.erizations conducted in the presence of a haloethane or halomethane, preferably containing at least four halogen atoms, are readily conducted. Representative materials include for example, chlorofluoromethane, bromofluoroethane, or preferably a chlorofluoroethane or chlorofluoromethane containing at least four halogen atoms including, for example, 1,1,2 trichloro 1,2,2 trifluoroethane, trichlorofluoromethane, l chloro 1,1,2,2,2 pentafluoroethane, dichlorodifluoromethane, 1, 2 ditluoro l,l,2, 2 tetrachloro ethane and the like.The amounts of these materials used may be varied from due amount just sufficient to make a slurry of the reactants up to where there is a substantial excess sf the cnlorofluoroethane, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Preferred diluents are those which are solvents for the monomers but nonsolvents for the polymers. Polymerization in the diluent medium is carried out in the presence of a free radical catalyst in a closed vessel in an inert atmosphere and under autogenous pressure or artificially induced pressure or in an open vessel under reflux at atmospheric pressure. Temperature of the polymerization may be varied from OOC to 1000C, depending to a large degree on the molecular weight desired in the polymer.Polymerization under reflux at 500 to 900C under atmospheric pressure using a free radical catalyst is generally effective in bringing a polymer yield of 75 to 100 in less than 10 hours. Suitable catalysts include peroxygen compounds such as sodium, potassium and ammonium persulfates, caprylyl peroxide, benzoyl peroxide, hydrogen peroxide, pelargonyl peroxide, cumene hydroperoxides, tertiary butyl diperphthalate, tertiary butyl perbenzoate, sodium peracetate, sodium percarbonate, and the like as well as azodiisobutyryl nitrile, hereinafter referred to as azoisobutyronitrile. Other catalysts utilizable are the so called redox type of catalyst and the heavy metal activated catalyst systems. The basic materials normally used to make the ionic form of the carboxyl containing polymers normally in salt form normally have at least some solubility in lower alkanols containing 1 to 5 carbon atoms such as methanol, ethanol, propanol and tertiary butanol optionally in combination with simple glycols such as ethane diol, propane diol and the like. Particularly useful basic materials, for example, are sodium hydroxide, which is soluble to the extent of 1 gram in 4.2 grams of methanol and 1 gram in 7.2 grams of ethanol, and potassium hydroxide which has a solubility for example, of 1.0 grams in 3.0 grams of ethanol. Other typical basic materials include sodium methoxide in methanol, for example, som ethoxide in ethanol, for example, sodium isopropoxicle In isopropanol, potassium methoxide in methanol, potassium ethoxide in ethanol, potassium tert butoxide in tert butanol. Other useful ionic forming materials include ammonium or potassium acetate, lithium acetate, aluminum isopropoxide and the like. Particularly useful alkali metal hydroxides and alkoxides, including preferably sodium hydroxide in methanol, potassium hydroxide in ethanol and sodium ethoxide in ethanol. The basic material used preferably has solubility in the alcohol solvent of greater than 0.1 grams per ml of alcohol. At least 305 of the acid, carboxyl, groups are neutralized to an ionic state, that is, CO2M . Preferably, about 50 to 90 weight percent of the acid groups are neutralized to CO2M. As water absorbent materials these polymers find many uses in powder, lump, film, fiber, fabric form and like form. They are of particular utility in the disposable nonwoven industry where there is need for polymers which will absorb and retain water and ionic physiological fluids. An important feature of these polymers is their enhanced thickening property even in the presence of a salt. Specific applications include disposable diapers, medical surgical supplies and personal care products. Such applications require a polymer which must imbibe the liquid to be absorbed rapidly and be a polymer that will not dissolve. Further, the fluid must be immobilized or congealed in some way to be retained. The materials may also be used as suitable additives to greatly Increase the absorptive power of conventional absorbents such as cotton, wood pulp and other cellulosic absorbents used in applications such as wiping cloths, surgical sponges, catamenial devices, and the like. In a specific application, for example, a disposable diaper, there is an inner layer of a soft absorbent nonwoven material that absorbs and passes urine to an inner layer of fluffy fibrous absorbent mat.nrialr, wherein during the construction of this nonwoven fiber agglomerates or fibers of the polymers of this invention JLli be included and an additional impervious plastic layer, as polyethylene.A film of the copolymers of this invention may be used between the outer plastic layer and the inner fluffy absorbent layer. Use of the polymers of this invention can result in reduction in the bulk size of many disposable nonwovens.
