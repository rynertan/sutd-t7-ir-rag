## Description
PYRIDINYL AND IMIDAZOLYL DERIVATIVES OF BENZOFURANS AND BENZOTHIOPHENES The present invention relates to novel organic compounds which are pyridinyl and imidazolyl derivatives of benzofurans and benzothiophenes. These compounds can have utility as thromboxane A2 inhibitors. Since the discovery that human platelets convert the prostaglandin endoperoxide PGH into a labile pro aggregatory molecule known as thromboxane A2 TXA2 , researchers have sought compounds that could selectively inhibit the biological activity of TXA2. This end may be achieved in two different ways the synthesis of TXA2 can be blocked by inhibiting TXA2 synthetase, or a compound can be used which is a receptor level antagonist of TXA2. As therapeutic agents, TXA2 synthetase inhibitors are more useful see for example, Gorman, Biological and PharmacologicalEvaluation of Thromboxane Synthetase Inhibitors ,Advances in Prostaglandin and Thromboxane Research, 6 417 1980 , and references cited therein. Selective inhibitors of TXA2 synthetase are particularly important. A number of TXA2 5 ynthetase inhibitors are known, including the bi heterocyclic 9,11 trideoxy PGF type compounds disclosed in US Patent Specification No 4,112,224 SQ 80,388, i.e. l 3 phenyl 2 propenyl lH imidazole, dis closed by Harris et al., Advances in Prostaglandin and Thromboxane research 6 437 1980 pyridine and its derivatives, as disclosed by hsiyamoto et al., Advances in Prostaglandin and Thromboxane research, 6 443 1980 and compounds disclosed in British Patent Specification No 2,039,903A.See also Tai et al., Advances in Prostaglandin and Thromboxane Research, 6 447 1980 . Other compounds which have been disclosed as thromboxane synthetase inhibitors include sodium p benzyl 4 l oxo 2 4 chlorobenzyl 3 phenylpropyl phenylphosphate, imidazoles, nordihydroguaiaretic acid and 12L hydroperoxy 5,8,10,14 eicosatetraenoic acid HETE . As noted in the British Patent Specification given above, the inhibitory activity of these latter compounds on thromboxane synthetase is very weak, making them unsatisfactory as medicines. Tetrahydropyridinyl and piperidinyl substituted benzofurans are disclosed in U.S. patent 4,259,338 as psychopharmaceuticals and antidepressants. Similar compounds are disclosed in GermanOffenleggunschrift 2,537,837.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Surprisingly and unexpectedly it has been found that selective thromboxane synthetase inhibition may be achieved by employing a compound of the formula F I wherein Z1 is a 4 pyridinyl, b 3 pyridinyl, c 3 pyridinyl substituted at the 4 position by 1 methyl, 2 OCH3, 3 N CH3 2, or 4 NH2, or 5 at the 2, 4, 5, or 6 position by chlorine d imidazolyl, or e imidazolyl substituted by Cl C alkyl wherein X1 is a CH2 n , b O , c S , d S O , e S O 2 , f CH2 O , g CH2 N R3 , h N R3 CH2 , i CH OH , j C O , or k O CHz with the proviso that when X1 is b , c , d , e , f , g , h , or k , Z1 is a , b , or c , i.e., a pyridinyl substituent wherein Y1 is a O or b S , with the proviso that when Y1 is S , X1 is other than d or e wherein R1 is hydrogen, a pharmacologically acceptable cation, Cl Cl2 alkyl, C3 Cio cycloalkyl, C7 C12 aralkyl, phenyl, phenyl mono , di , or trisubstituted by chloro, Ci C3 or alkyl, or phenyl para substituted by a NHCO R25, b O CO R26, c CO R24, d O CO p Ph R27, or e CH N NH CO NH2, wherein Rz4 is phenyl or acetamidophenyl, R25 is methyl, phenyl, acetamidophenyl, benzamidophenyl, or amino, R26 is methyl, phenyl amino or methoxy and R27 is hydrogen or acetamido, and wherein p Ph is 1,4 phenylene wherein Rz is a hydrogen, b C1 C3 alkyl, c phenyl, or d CO2R1 wherein Rd is a hydrogen, or b methyl wherein R4 is a hydrogen, b Cl C4 alkyl, or c phenyl wherein R7 is a hydrogen, b CH2OH, c COOR1, d CH2N R4 2, e CN f CON R4 a, or g C O R4 wherein R9 and R12 are the same or different and are a hydrogen, b hydroxy, c C1 Ct alkyl, d fluoro, e chloro, f bromo, g OCH3, or, h when taken together and attached to contiguous carbon atoms, O CHa O wherein D represents a single or a double bond and wherein m and n are the same or different and are the integers 0 to 4, inclusive including, pharmacologically acceptable acid addition salts thereof and when D represents a single bond, an enantiomer or a racemic mixture of enantiomers thereof.

The compounds of the present invention may be in the form of pharmacologically acceptable salts. These salts are formed when R1 is a pharmacologically acceptable cation. Such cations include pharmacologically acceptable metal cations, ammonium, amine cations, or quaternary ammonium cations. Especially preferred metal cations are those derived from the alkali metals, e.g., lithium, sodium, and potassium, and from the alkaline earth metals, e.g., magnesium and calcium, although cationic forms of other metals, e.g., aluminum, zinc, and iron are within the scope of this invention. Pharmacologically acceptable amine cations are those derived from primary, secondary, or tertiary amines. Examples of suitable amines are methyl amine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, ethyl amine, dibutylamine, triisopropylamine, N methylhexylamine, decylamine, dodecylamine, allylamine, crotylamine, cyclopentylamine, dicyclohexylamine, benzylamine, dibenzylamine, phenyl ethyl amine, B phenylethylamine, ethylenediamine, diethylenetriamine, and the like aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, araliphatic amines containing up to and including about 18 carbon atoms, as well as heterocyclic amines, e.g., piperidine, morpholine, pyrrolidine, piperazine, and lower alkyl derivatives thereof, e.g., 1 methylpiperidine, 4 ethylmorphol ine, 1 isopropylpyrrol idine, 2 methylpyrrol idine, 1,4 dimethylpiperazine, 2 methylpiperidine, and the like, as well as amines containing water solubilizing or hydrophilic groups, e.g, mono , di , and triethanolamine, ethyldiethanolamine, N butyl ethanol amine, 2 amino 1 butanol, 2 amino 2 ethyl 1,3 propanediol, 2 amino 2 methyl 1 propanol, tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane, N phenylethanolamine, N p tert amylphenyl diethanolamine, gl actamine, N methylglycamine, N methylglucosamine, ephedrine, phenyl ephrine, epinephrine, procaine, and the like.

Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts are formed at the heterocyclic amine moiety and are also useful for administering the compounds of this invention. These salts include hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydrojodide, sulfate, phosphate, acetate, propionate, lactate, maleate, malate, succinate, tartrate, and the like. They are prepared by methods well known in the art, e.g., as depicted inExample 8. The compounds of the present invention will be named herein as benzofurans, using the Chemical Abstracts numbering system see Naming and Indexing of Chemical Substances for Chemical Abstracts during theNinth Collective Period 1972 1976 , a reprint of section IV from theVolume 76 Index Guide. The compounds of the present invention were tested for TXA2 inhibition as follows Rabbit aortic strips were superfused in series with Krebs solution. Thromboxane A2 TXA2 was generated by mixing prostaglandin H2 PGH2 with human platelet microsomes HPM . Potential inhibitors were tested by comparing the response of the rabbit aorta to the amount of TXA2 produced by mixing PGH2 and HPM without the test compound in the reaction medium and then the amount of TXA2 produced when the test compound was added to the HPM 5 minutes before the HPM was mixed with PGH2. By this means compounds which selectively inhibit TXA2 synthetase are found. For a discussion ofTXA2 synthetase inhibition testing see, e.g., R. Gorman, supra. Using this test system, two compounds, ethyl 5 3 pyridinyl methyl benzofuran 2 carboxylic acid, sodium salt Example A 2 , and 5 3 pyridinylmethyl benzoCbathiophene Z carboxylic acid Example B 7 , have been shown to be the most effective in inhibiting TXAz formation.The former compound has an approximate ED50 in this system of 10 ng ml, and the latter has an approximate ED50 Of 1 ng ml. The novel compounds of this invention have thus been shown to be highly active as selective inhibitors of the thromboxane synthetase enzyme system. Accordingly, these novel compounds are useful for administration to mammals, including humans, whenever it is desirable medically to inhibit this enzyme system. For a discussion of the utility of TXA2 inhibitors, see, e.g., Derwent Farmdoc Nos. 18399B 72896B 72897B 63409B 03755C 03768C and 50111C. Thus, for example, these novel compounds are useful as anti inflammatory agents in mammals and especially humans, and for this purpose, are administered systemically and preferably orally. For oral administration, a dose range of 0.05 to 50 mg per kg of human body weight is used to give relief from pain associated with inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. They are also administered intravenously in aggravated cases of inflammation, preferably in a dose range 0.01 to 100 9 per kg per minute until relief from pain is attained. When used for these purposes, these novel compounds cause fewer and lesser undesirable side effects than do the known synthetase inhibitors used to treat inflammation, for example, aspirin and indomethacin.When these novel compounds are administered orally, they are formulated as tablets, capsules, or as liquid preparations, with the usual pharmaceutical carriers, binders, and the like. For intravenous use, sterile isotonic solutions are preferred. These compounds are useful whenever it is desired to inhibit platelet aggregation, reduce the adhesive character of platelets, and remove or prevent the formation of thrombi in mammals, including man, rabbits, dogs, and rats. For example, these compounds are useful in the treatment and prevention of myocardial infarcts, to treat and prevent post operative thrombosis, to promote patency of vascular grafts following surgery, and to treat conditions such as atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, blood clotting defects due to lipemia, and other clinical conditions in which the underlying etiology is associated with lipid imbalance or hyperlipidemia. For these purposes, these compounds are administered systemically, e.g., intravenously, subcutanesusly, intramuscularly, and in the form of sterile implants for prolonged action.For rapid response especially in emergency situations, the intravenous route of administration is preferred. Doses in the range about 0.005 to about 20 mg per kg of body weight per day are used, the exact dose depending on the age, weight, and condition of the patient or animal, and on the frequency and route of administration. These compounds are further useful as additives to blood, blood products, blood substitutes, or other fluids which are used in artificial extracorporeal circulation or perfusion of isolated body portions, e.g., limbs and organs, whether attached to the original body, detached and being preserved or prepared for transplant, or attached to a new body. During these circulations and perfusions, aggregated platelets tend to block the blood vessels and portions of the circulation apparatus. This blocking is avoided by the presence of these compounds.For this purpose, the compound is added gradually or in single or multiple portions to the circulating blood, to the blood of the donor animal, to the perfused body portion, attached or detached, to the recipient, or to two or all of these at a total steady state dose of about 0.001 to 10 mg per liter of circulating fluid. It is especially useful to use these compounds in laboratory animals, e.g., cats, dogs, rabbits, monkeys, and rats, for these purposes in order to develop new methods and techniques for organ and limb transplants. The compounds of the present invention are useful in mammals, including humans and certain useful animals, e.g., dogs and pigs, to reduce or avoid gastrointestinal ulcer formation, and accelerate the healing of such ulcers already present in the gastrointestinal tract.For this purpose, these compounds are injected or infused intravenously, subcutaneously, or intramuscularly in an infusion dose range about 0.1 ug to about 500 uglkg of body weight per minute, or in a total daily dose by injection or infusion in the range about 0.1 to about 20 mg kg of body weight per day, the exact dose depending on the age, weight, and condition of the patient or animal, and on the frequency and route of administration. The novel compounds are used for the purposes described above in the free acid form, in ester form, and in the pharmacologically acceptable salt form. When the ester form is used, the ester is any of those within the above definition of R1. However, it is preferred that the ester be alkyl of one to 12 carbon atoms, inclusive. Of the alkyl esters, methyl and ethyl are especially preferred for optimum absorption of the compound by the body or experimental animal system and straight chain octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, and dodecyl are especially preferred for prolonged activity in the body or experimental animal. Thromboxane synthetase converts PGH2 prostaglandin endoperoxide into TXA2. PGH2 is also converted to prostacyclin, PGDz, and other compounds by other enzymes. Thus, because the compounds of this invention inhibit thromboxane A2 synthetase, they increase the PGH2 substrat and thus increase the amount of endogenous prostacyclin. Therefore, they are a also useful for many of the pharmacological purposes for which prostacyclin is employed. Prostacyclin and a thromboxane synthetase inhibitor have both been shown to be effective in controlling tumor cell metastasis, see, e.g., K. Honn, et al., Thromboxane Synthetase Inhibitors andProstacyclin Can Control Tumor Cell Metastasis, an Abstract of theTwentieth Annual Meeting of the American Society for Cell Biology, in the Journal of Cell Biology, 87 64 1980 . Similarly, prostacyclin has been shown to be an effective antihypertensive agent. The compounds of the present invention are also used for this purpose. See, e.g., British patent specification 2,039,903A . For a general discussion of the utility of TXA2 synthetase inhibitors which increase endogenous prostacyclin, see, Aiken, et al.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 219 299 1981 . The compounds of the present invention are prepared by the methods depicted in Chart Thus, the compounds of the present invention wherein m is zero and R2 is hydrogen are prepared by the method of Chart A. In Chart A, R10 is all substituents within the scope of R1 excluding the pharmacologically acceptable cations. All other variables in Chart A are defined as above. A hydroxybenzaldehyde of the Formula X is cyclized into the compounds of the present invention by methods known in the art. See, e.g., S.Tanaka, J. Am. Chem.
