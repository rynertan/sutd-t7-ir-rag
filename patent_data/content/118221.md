# Nonwoven fibrous backing for vinyl wallcover.

## Abstract
A wallcover backing for strippable vinyl wallcovering comprises a dimensionally stable unitary multistratum non woven fibrous web material that can be coated with or laminated to a vinyl layer. The backing material has a fibrous top phase adapted for secure nondelaminating engagement with the vinyl layer superimposed thereon and a fibrous base stratum integrated with the top phase and adapted for strippable adhering engagement with a wall or the like. The top phase constitutes at least 5 percent by weight of the web and has a smooth exposed surface for direction adhesion to the vinyl layer. The web includes about 15 to 45 percent by weight of a hydrophobic latex binder and contains an adhesive penetration inhibitor adapted to inhibit the migra tion of a wallcover adhesive into the fibrous web material and to promote uniform and full strippability of the web from the wall to which it is adhered.
