# A method and apparatus for measuring radon in the ground.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method of measuring the concentration of radon and radon daughters in the ground, particularly at great depth and or below the ground water level. In accordance with the invention a detector 11 is freely suspended from a wire 12 and placed in a container 10 intended for collecting gas rising up from the ground. The container 10 is buried at a desired depth beneath the surface of the ground and the detector 11 is exposed to the gas in the container over a given period of time. Subsequent to this exposure period, the detector 11 is drawn up by means of the wire 12 , together with a sleeve 14 , protecting the detector from contact with surrounding ground, th rough the roof of the container and up through the ground, to a location so selected that the registered contents of radon and radon daughters can then be determined on the basis of the data registered on the detector. The invention also relates to preferred apparatus for carrying out the method.
