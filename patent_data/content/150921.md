# Method of making a void free non cellulose electrical winding.

## Abstract
Methods of constructing a void free, cellulose free electri cal winding insulated with a solid resinous insulation, by form ing a plurality of conductor turns on a substrate, with each con ductor turn being immersed in liquid resinous insulation as it is formed, to provide a void free intermediate structure. The void free aspect includes the final step by building solid insulation, thin layer upon thin layer, from the liquid resinous insulation, while the conductor turns are being formed, with the solid insu lation.
