# Automatic read system for peripheral controller.

## Abstract
A peripheral controller is used to manage data transfers between peripheral units of the magnetic tape type. A pro gram sequencer in the peripheral contoller can signal an automatic read write selection logic and control unit to oper ate in the automatic read mode whereby an automatic read logic unit will transfer data out of the magnetic tape peripheral unit into a buffer memory of the peripheral controller on a continuous basis without further instructions being required from the program sequencer.
