# Method and apparatus for cryogenic grinding.

## Abstract
The production rate of a conventional cryogenic grind ing system incorporating an impact mill 24 may be increased by a providing means 27 to allow at least 70 of the embrittled material entering the mill 24 to leave the mill 24 before it passes the inlet 31 and b providing means 37 to restrict the flow of the cold gas through the impact mill. The product leaving the impact mill 24 is screened 29 and any oversize is preferably recycled 30 to the impact mill.
