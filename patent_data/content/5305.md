# Internally heatable nozzle having a divisible housing and a divisible core.

## Abstract
An internally heatable nozzle provided with a divisible housing 1, 2 having a cylindrical bore 4 being narrowed at one end towards the mouth opening 5 of the nozzle, in said bore 4 a cylindrical and at one end conical core 10, 11 being connected at one end in the housing, said core being provided with an internal heating element with connecting leads passed laterally through the housing and being divisible in transverse direction, between which core and which housing an annular channel being found in which a feeding channel going through the housing debouches at the side 6 remote from the mouth opening the parts 10, 11 of the core being provided with directly adjacent flanges 12, 13 said flanges being provided with throughgoing channels 14 arranged in axial direction in the extension of the annular channel between the core and the housing and the flanges being clamped between inner shoulders 7, 8 on the parts of the housing being tensioned together by tensile elements 3 .
