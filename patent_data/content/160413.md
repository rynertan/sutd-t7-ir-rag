# CATALYST AND METHOD OF PREPARATION AND USE THEREOF FOR POLYMERIZING ALPHA OLEFINS

## Abstract
A catalyst composition for polymerizing alpha olefins is prepared by treating a carrier containing OH groups with an organomagnesium composition and contacting the thus formed magnesium containing carrier with a solution of a titanium IV alkoxide and a brominating and or chlorinating agent. The adjustment of the molar ratio of the brominating and or chlorinating agent to the titanium alkoxide yields catalysts which produce polymers of varying molecular weight distribution, as measured by the melt flow ratio MFR values.
