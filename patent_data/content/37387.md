# A sheet assembly and method of manufacturing same.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a sheet assembly with a permeability at least to gaseous media, as well as a method for manufacturing same. The object of the present invention is to produce a sheet assembly which may be used as a forming fabric, press fabric and or drying fabric, including as a press felt or drying felt. This object is achieved in that a sheet assembly according to the present invention is characterised by a foil 1 of a substantially liquid impermeable material which is coordi nated with a reinforcement structure 3 which is disposed wholly or partially within the foil 1 and is permeable to gas and possibly also to liquid, as least the foil 1 displaying substantially vertical through channels 2 .
