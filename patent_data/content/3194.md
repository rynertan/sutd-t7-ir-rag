# Hot melt, pressure sensitive adhesives.

## Abstract
This invention relates to blends of plasticizing oils and compatible tackifying resins with substantially amorphous or semicrystalline olefin copolymers containing a C₃ to C₅ linear α olefin and 15 to 60 mole percent of a C₆ to C₁₀ linear α olefin which are useful as hot melt, pressure sensitive adhesives. The unmodified copolymer base resins have melt viscosities in the range of 5,000 cp up to 1,000,000 cp at 190 C. The addition of the plasticizing oils and compatible tackifying resins to the copolymer base resin causes an unexpected increase in the shear adhesion failure time in addition to improved coatability as well as substantial increases in probe tack and peel adhesion values of the copolymers.
