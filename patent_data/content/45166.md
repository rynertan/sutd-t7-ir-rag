# A sleeve bearing half shell, a journalled bearing assembly comprising such half shell and a method of forming the assembly.

## Abstract
A sleeve bearing half shell 18 , a journalied bearing as sembly including two such half shells and a method of forming the assembly, wherein the half shell has an outer surface 20 and an inner bearing surface 22 with the surtaces extending axially between laterally spaced opposite end 24 and circum ferentially between oppositeiy disposed parting faces 26 with the bearing surface 22 being concave and the outer surface 20 being convex axially between the ends while in the free state. In use external forces are applied to the half shells to force the concave and convex surfaces 20,22 into a straight configuration axially between the ends 24 thereof so that the stresses in the half shells are greater along the circumferential centre line than along the circumferential ends 24 .
