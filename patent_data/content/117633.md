# Vertical single filer conveyor system.

## Abstract
Air operated material handling equipment moves objects such as upright cylindrical containers 14 from a mass in a bulk storage zone A , over a transport surface 18 having a prear ranged pattern of flotation air jet openings 32 in the surface slanted in a downstream direction. The transport surface 18 is divided into a plurality of zones including a bulk storage zone A and a single file zone E with one or more intermediate transport zones B, C, D therebetween. The intermediate transfer zones B, C, D have converging sides such as 88, 90 , to move the containers 14 from the bulk storage area A into single file. Jets of air are delivered by the angularly disposed flotation air jet openings to lift, support and to move the articles forward. Additional acceleration jets 129, 131 , of larger size accelerate the leading containers to separate them from the mass of containers in the intermediate transport zones B, C, D to move them into single file.
