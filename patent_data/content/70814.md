## Description
. Description of the invention entitled . COMPENSATOR DEVICE FOR THE BOBBIN WINDING CARRIAGE INTEXTILE MACHINES This invention concerns a compensator device for the car . riage that winds bobbins in textile machines with one or more . bobbins, said device being suitable for enabling the sliver leaving a drawing frame or derived machine to be taken up. The main object of the invention is to provide a compen . sator device able to convey, and maintain a constant length of the sliver between the exit of the drawing frame or derived machine and the intake of the sliver itself by the re volving funnel of the traversing carriage that winds bobbins. It is known that the movement of the sliver from the cal . ender of the drawing frame to the bobbin has to take place with the fibres kept as condensed as possible so that self . . regulation between the fibres does not permit false drafting.to occur in the tract of sliver which runs in the compen sator, for said tract of sliver has of necessity to undergo the take up tension necessary for the formation of a compact. yarn package. It is also known that as the position of the delivery of the sliver from the drawing group stays unmoved and c9rre sponds to about the centre line of the spindle, the path of the sliver between said delivery position and the spindle will vary continuously in length, unless suitable devices are present, and the sliver will therefore undergo repeated stretching when it coindices with the ends of the bobbin, and repeated slackening when it coincides with the middle of the bobbin. Such repeated actions are enhanced by the fact that due to the constructional requirements of the machine the length.of the path followed by the sliver between the delivery cal .enders and the take up spindle tends to be kept as short as possible. The repeated slackening and stretching are very harmful for the sliver owing to its low strength and consistancy. Devices have been made to eliminate said unwanted stretching and slackening and to guide the sliver along an oblige. tory path of an always constant length. Said known devices obtain this result with articulated joint elements, pulley elements or other like elements. Our invention fulfils its purpose of guiding the sliver along an obligatory path of an always constant length with a compensator device of flexible nature which is of simpler and more solid construction than the known devices and which also enables the length of the path between the delivery point and the take up spindle to be kept as short as possible. The present invention thereof proposes compensator device.characterized by consisting of a sliver flexible support ar ranged in a bow shape and flexibly anchored at one end to the exit of the drawing frame delivery calender and at its other end to the bobbin winding carriage trasversing along the yarn bobbin being formed along which flexible support the sliver is constrained to run at a constant arc length. According to a first embodiment of the invention the com pensator device consists of at least one flexible element which has a constant length and is arranged in a bow shaped position between the delivery calender and the bobbin winding carriage moving backwards and forwards along the bobbin being wound, and which is anchored at its free end by means.of a support to said carriage and fixed end to a support located near said delivery calender, and which has a curvature varying with the variation in distance between its two ends and able to compensate for the variation in distance between the delivery point of the sliver from the calender and the point where said sliver is caused to be deposited on the bobbin owing to the movement of the carriage. According to the first embodiment of the invention the compensator device includes at least two articuled joints each of which is placed between one end of said flexible bow shaped element and the relative support, both said joints being able to prevent the torsional stressing of said flexible element during the movement of the carriage, and a series of substantially tubular sliver guide elements installed elastically on said flexible element and able to guide the path of the sliver, whereby said elements have their end portions flared where the sliver enters and leaves them, so as to prevent said sliver scraping against the end surfaces of said tubular elements. According to another embodiment the compensator device of.the invention consists essentially of a spring steel wire wound in coils with a spiral having its diameter and coil pitch differentiated in at least three different tracts, whereby the compensator is anchored at one end to the exit of the drawing frame calender and at its other end to the bobbin winding carriage trasversing along the yarn package being formed and whereby the sliver runs insides said coils. According to one aspect of the second embodiment the spirals of the first and last tracts have greater coil pitch.and smaller diameter as compared to the middle tract and have the task of guiding the sliver and the additional task of imparting a false twist to it at the same time. According to yet another aspect of the second embodiment one of the spirals or both the spirals of the first and last.tracts impart to the sliver a false twist which runs in the reverse direction in respect of the feed of the sliver itself. As it consists of steel wire, the compensator device of this embodiment has the low inertia needed to resist the fat.igue stress generated by its alternating movement in winding.the yarn package. An advantage provided by the compensator device of the latter embodiment lies in the fact that its low inertia facilitates the rapid alternating movement of the bobbin wind ing carriage. According to the second embodiment the inlet of the compensator device is secured to the drawing frame or like machine with appendages which are clamped downstream from the calender and the outlet of the compensator device is secured.to the bobbin winding carriage with an appendage of the sliver exit guide. To be more exact, the inlet of the second embodiment consists of two closed coils which have the task of giving necessary elasticity for the alternating movement of the com pensator device, which swings and pivots on said coils in the vertical and horizontal planes. In both embodiments the actual length of the compensator device does not vary with the variation of the position of the bobbin winding carriage and therefore the length of the sliver running within the compensator device remains stricly constant, thus leading to perfect compensation. Hereinafter we shall describe two preferential embodiments of the invention as a non restrictive examples with the help of the drawings wherein fig. 1 gives an overall view of the delivery of the drawing frame with a bobbin and with the compensator device according to a first embodiment of the invention fig. 2 shows a section through a guide element of the com pensator of the embodiment of fig. 1 fig. 3 fives a front view of a textile machine comprising the compensator device according to a second embodi ment fig. 4 gives a side view of the machine shown in fig. 3 fig. 5 shows the compensator device according to the second embodiment fig. Sa shows the inlet head of the compensator device of fig. 5 and the relative anchorage means of the inven . tion fig. Sb shows the outlet end of the compensator device of fig. 5 and the relative anchorage means of the second. embodiment fig. 6 gives a three dimensional view of the application of the device of the invention to a bobbin winding car riage feeding two bobbins. In the figures the same parts or parts having the same functions bear the same reference numbers. Figures 1 and 2 show the compensator device 10 of the in . vent ion according to a first embodiment and the sliver 112 of fibres leaving the delivery calender 14 of the drawing frame 12 and being wound onto the bobbin 15 upheld by the spindle 16 of the take up group. The bobbin winding carriage 18 running on a guide element.19 is also shown. Flexible bow shaped sliver support 20, which may consist of a couple of harmonic wires, flexible rods or like elements is arranged between said delivery calender 14 and said carriage 18 and have their free ends 13 with supports 22 anchored to said carriage 18 and their fixed ends 11 to a support 23 located near said delivery calender 14. Articulated joints 24 are located between each 11, 13 end of said flexible elements 20 and the relative support 22. The flexible support 20 have fixed thereon tubular sliver guide elements 26 which have their end portions suitably flared, where the sliver enters and leaves them, so as to prevent said sliver scraping against the end surface 28 of said tubular elements 26. Let us now look at the method of working of this embodiment after been processed on the combing head, the sliver 112 leaves the calender 14, and is made to pass within the sliver guide elements 26 and carriage 18 and is wound around the bobbin 15 on spindle 16 of the take up group the path followed by the sliver 112 from the calender 14 to the car . riage 18 is kept to a constant length owing to the action of the flexible support 20, which, by varying their curvature during the to and fro movement of the carriage 18, com .pensate for the variation in distance between the delivery point of the sliver 112 from the calender 14 and the point where the sliver is caused to be deposited on the bobbin 15 by said movement of the slider 18. It is to be appreciated that the flexible bow shaped el ements 20 can also consist of foils of various materials or other flexible bodies and that the sliver guide elements 26 can be conformed and fitted differently without departing thereby from the scope of this embodiment. Figs. 3 to 6, refer to a second embodiment of the compen sator device 110 consisting of a sliver flexible support 120 which has an inlet head 11 secured with a support 122 to the machine or drawing frame 12 substantially at the exit of the calender 14, and an outlet end 13 secured to the inlet of a revolving funnel 17 borne by the bobbin winding car.riage 18 moving with an alternating movement on the guide 19 located along the bobbin 15 fed with the sliver 112 coming from the drawing frame or machine 12. The sliver flexible support 120 of this embodiment consists preferably of spring wire wound in coils with a plurality of tracts of spirals having differentiated diameters and coil pitches. In this specific example the flexible support 120 con sists essentially of spring steel wire wound in coils and stretching from the drawing frame 12 to the bobbin winding carriage 18 said wire has a first tract 210 with coils spaced widely apart, a middle tract 310 acting as an elbow and having coils close together and with a larger diameter than the first tract 210, and a last tract 410 with coils spaced widely apart and a smaller diameter than the middle tract 310. Anchorage means 30 and 31 respectively are envisaged at each end of the coiled wire and have the task of securing the inlet head 11 to the support 122 of the drawing frame 12 and the outlet end 113 to the bobbin winding carriage 18. Said anchorage means 30, 31 are solidly fixed to the rela tive end portions 11, 13 of the coiled wire, and said end portions 11, 13 respectively consist advantageously of a num ber of coils acting as an articulated joint and as a sliver guide at the inlet and outlet of the wire. To be more exact, the end portion at the inlet 11 consists of two closed coils side by side 201 which have the task of providing the necessary elasticity for the alternating movement of the compensator device 110, which swings and pivots on the end coils 201 in the vertical and horizontal planes, whereby said two closed coils 201 are provided with appendages 130 that constitute the anchorage means 30 of fig. 5a clamped to the support 122 of the drawing frame 12.The outlet end portion 13 consists likewise of a closed coil 211 having an appendage 131 which constitutes the anchor age means and cooperates with a joint 132 mounted on ball bearings located on the bobbin winding carriage 18. According to this embodiment the coils of the first tract. 210 and or last tract 410 can advantageously but not necess . arily be wound in opposite directions such as to impart to the sliver in the first tract a false twist that runs in the reverse direction in respect of the feed of the sliver it self and to take away same in the last tract 410. Fig. 6 shows a machine to which are fitted two compen sator devices 110, according to the second embodiment, each of which serves a winding station located at the side of the. machine. The mode of operation of this embodiment is basically similar to the first embodiment described herein before. We have described here a second preferential embodiment of the invention but other variants of this embodiment are possible the wire may consist of another suitable metal . it is possible to conform and fit the anchorage elements 30 and 31 differently without departing thereby from the scope of the invention. 1
