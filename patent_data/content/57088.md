## Description
The present invention relates to granular detergent compositions comprising detergent additive composition having improved storage stability. It is widely recognized that the function of a detergent additive material can be significantly impaired in a detergent composition by interaction between the additive material and other component of the composition. For example, enzymes, perfumes and bleach activator can be deleteriously effected by interaction with peroxy bleaches cationic fabric conditioners can be deleteriously effected by interaction with anionic surfactants and fluorescers can be deleteriously effected by interaction with peroxy bleaches or cationic surfactans. Moreover, the consumer acceptability of a product can also be significantly reduced as the result of physical interaction between a detergent additive and other components of a detergent composition. For instance, a speckle detergent containing a water soluble dye can lose its aesthetic appeal as a result of migration of the dye into the detergent base powder, an effect which can be significantly enhanced by the present in the detergent composition of a nonionic surfactant component. Physical segregation problems in the case of abnormally sized additive materials can also contribute to reduce aesthetic apeal and effectiveness of a detergent composition. The Applicants have now discovered that certain multifunctional photoactivator dye detergent additive material having improved storage stability in a detergen composition, can be provided by releasably enclosing the additive material within a glassy matrix of amorphous phosphate material. The idea of coating, agglomerating or encapsulating sensitive ingredients to provide improved storage stability is well known, of course. thus, EP A 2293 discloses a detergent tablet coated with a hydrated salt applied to the tablet in the form of a melt. Conventionally, organic material have found the greatest favour as coating agents because such materials readily form the substantially continuous barrier necessary for effective stabilitation of the additive material. GB A 1,204,123, GB A 1,441,416 and GB A 1,395,006 are representative of this general approach. However, organic coating materials suffer the disadvantage that, to be efficaceous, the coating material must be so water impervious i.e., hydrophobic and also possibly so high melting as to considerably inhibit the rate of release of the additive material into a detergent wash liquor. By contrast, the coating materials of the present invention provide a matrix which effectively encloses and protects the detergent additive material, yet which is readily water soluble and provides for rapid release of the additive material into a bulk detergent liquor. According to the invention, there is provided a granular detergent composition comprising all percentages being by weight of the granular detergent composition characterized in that the detergent additive composition comprises an intimate mixture of the photoactivator dye with a hydratable water soluble. crystalline salt, the intimate mixture being releasably enclosed within a substantially continuous glassy matrix of amorphous phosphate material having the general formula I wherein M is hydrogen, alkali metal, ammonium or a substituted ammonium groups, y has a value in the range from 2 to 50, and the ratio x y is from 0.7 1 to 1.7 1. Highly preferred photoactivators are the zinc phthalocyanine tri and tetrasulphonates and mixtures thereof. These material are discussed in detail in EP A 3861. Regarding the amorphous phosphate, this preferably has a y value in the range from 3 to 30 and an x y ratio in the range from 0.85 top 1.5. In highly preferred embodiments, the amorphous phosphate has a y value in the range from 6 to 15 with an x y ratio in the range from 1 to 1.3. Suitably, the amorphous phosphate has a dissolution rate in distilled water at 25 C such that the time for 90 dissolution of the phosphate is in the range from 5 minutes to 2 hours, preferably from 8 minutes to 20 minutes. Dissolution rate is measured on 1.5 samples of phosphate in the form of particles of seive size thru 20 on 30 mesh 841 495 µm , the phosphate being added to 15 ml of water in 20 ml vials, stirring being effected by rotation of a wheel to the circumference of which the vials are attached radially. The amorphous phosphate is present in the detergent additive compositions in relatively minor levels. Generally, the phosphate comprises from 1 to 15 by weight of the particles of the detergent additive composition, preferably from 3 to 10 and more preferably from 5 to 8 by weight thereof. The detergent additive composition itself suitably has an average particle size of from 250 µm to 3000 µm, preferably from 500 µm to 2000 µm. The detergent additive composition comprises the storage sensitive detergent additive material in the form of an intimate mixture with a hydratable water soluble crystalline salt. The mixture of additive material and crystalline salt is then releasably enclosed within a substantially continuous glassy matrix of amorphous phosphate material. Although the crystalline salt is hydratable, it is preferably present in a least partially hydrated form in the intimate mixture, for instance, hydrated to an extent of 40 to 70 , more preferably from 50 to 70 of its theoretical maximum hydration capacity. A highly preferred crystalline salt is pentasodium tripolyphosphate hydrated to an extend of 55 to 65 of its maximum hydration capacity. The invention is of advantage in formulating speckles comprising the photoactivator dye of formula II as additive compositions having reduced tendency to bleed when added to a detergent composition comprising a nonionic surfactant. Preferably, bleeding is reduced to an extend such that when the particulate detergent additive composition is added to a mixed solvent containing the nonionic surfactant and water in a 100 6 ratio at 40 C, the rate of bleed is reduced by a factor of at least 3 compared with the rate for a corresponding additive composition free of the amorphous phosphate material. A method for making the detergent additive compositions includes the step of enrobing the storage sensitive additive material with a continuous glassy matrix of the amorphous phosphate. A preferred method comprises spraying an aqueous solution comprising the amorphous phosphate onto moving granules of a mixture of the photoactivator dye of formula II and a hydratable water soluble salt, thereby enrobing the additive material with a continuous glassy matrix of the amorphous phosphate. The individual components of the invention will now be discussed in detail. The detergent additive material is a photoactivator of the porphine type. Material of this general class were originally disclosed for use in detergent compositions in GB A 1,372,035 and GB A 1,408,144. The photoactivators can provide fabric bleaching effect in built detergent compositions in the presence of visible light and atmospheric oxygen and can also synergistically enhance the bleaching effect of conventional bleaching agents such as sodium perborate. The porphine bleach is preferably used in an amount such that the level of porphine in final detergent composition is in the range from 0.001 to 0.5 , more preferably from 0.002 to 0.02 , especially from 0.003 to 0.01 by weight. The porphines useful in the present invention are species of various substituted porphines. One form of substitution involves substituting 1, 2, 3 or 4 aza groups N for the methine group CH in porphine. Substitution at hydrogen atoms of the pyrrole ring can also be undertaken, for instance by aliphatic or aromatic groups, or by ortho fused polycyclic substituents. An example of the latter is phthalocyanine viz tetrabenzotetraazaporphine . So called meso substitution of the methine hydrogen atoms is also possible, as well as metallation by a heavy metal atom in a chelation structure, and substitution of the porphine by solubilizing groups such as carboxylate, sulphate, phosphate and sulphonate, polyethoxylates and onium salts.
