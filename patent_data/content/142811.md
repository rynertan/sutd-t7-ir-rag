# METHOD OF PREPARING 1,2,4 TRIAZOLO Ã›1,5 A PYRIMIDINE 2 SULFONYL CHLORIDES

## Abstract
1,2,4 Triazolo 1,5 a pyrimidine 2 sulfonyl chloride compounds are prepared by reacting a 1,2,4 triazolo 1,5 a pyrimidine 2 mercapto or arylmethylthio compound with an effective amount of a hypochlorite solution in a two phase solvent system comprising a aqueous acidic phase and an organic phase under conditions sufficient to cause formation of the desired sulfonyl chloride compounds.
