# FERROFLUID MAGNETIC SEAL APPARATUS AND METHOD OF FORMING SUCH A SEAL

## Abstract
A single stage, ferrofluid magnetic seal apparatus compri ses an annular, permanent magnet ring element 12 adapted to surround a shaft 18 to be sealed, which shaft extends be tween first low pressure and second high pressure first and second pole pieces 14, 16 in a magnetic flux relationship with the permanent magnet, and having one and the other ends, the other end extending into a close, noncontacting rela tionship with the surface of the shaft, to define a radial gap therebetween a plurality of stages 24 formed in the radial gap under the other end of the second pole piece 16 , which pole piece is placed toward the high pressure side of the envi ronment, and the radial gap 26 under the first pole piece 14 , placed toward the low pressure side of the environment, being shallow and generally less than about 2 mils 0.05 mm and ferrofluid 20 in the radial gap under the other end of the second pole piece to form a plurality of separate O ring ferro fluid seals of defined pressure capacity, thereby providing a single stage, ferrofluid magnetic seal apparatus which has a re duced tendency to permit unpredictable air bursts, when in stalled about the rotary shaft between first and second pres sure environments.
