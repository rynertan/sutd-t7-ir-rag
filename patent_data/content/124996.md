# RYE FLAVORING

## Abstract
A lump free rye flavoring comprising approximately 40 90 by weight of rye flour, 4 15 liquid acid flavorings and 8 45 of dry flavourings by weight to yield 100 of the rye flour is made by premixing some or all the rye flour and dry flavorings preblending the liquid acid flavorings spraying the blended liquid acid flavorings into the dry components to form an aggregate and optionally coarse grinding the aggre gate through a 1 8 inch screen while simultaneously dusting the ground aggregate with the remaining rye flour. The aggregate or ground aggregate is then permitted to set until a non rubbery consistency results and grinding the resultant composition into a powder and mixing the resultant composi tion to achieve uniform lump free rye flavoring. Use of the rye flavoring in a bread mix is also disclosed.
