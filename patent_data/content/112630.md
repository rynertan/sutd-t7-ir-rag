# Hand tool for terminating wires in a connector.

## Abstract
A wire inserting ram 3 is reciprocably mounted in a tool frame 1 which defines a guideway for a connector 7 extending transversely of the ram path. Spring biased wire grippers 20 are mounted above a wire pusher 27, 28 at a forward end of the ram 7 to support a wire 22 against dis placement on trimming between a pusher part 29 and a shear plate 18 on the frame, on forward movement of the ram 7 . A bore 36 in the frame allows passage of trimmed wire. Cam means 26 on the frame 1 is arranged to en gage the wire grippers 20 on withdrawal of the ram 7 to urge them against the spring bias to an open condition.
