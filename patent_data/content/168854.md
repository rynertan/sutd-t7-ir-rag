# Process for the manufacture of a polyamide.

## Abstract
Process for preparing polyamide by anionically poly merizing lactam in the presence of an alkaline metal cata lyst, an activator and at least one low molecular weight ester compound. The polymerization process is rapid and yields polyamides having good impact strengths. The pro cess significantly reduces moulding time in reaction injec tion moulding.
