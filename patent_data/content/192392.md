# INSULIN RECEPTOR, ITS PURIFICATION, ITS PRODUCTION IN RECOMBINANT CELLS, DNA THEREFOR, ANTIBODIES TO INSULIN RECEPTOR AND THEIR PREPARATION, AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM

## Description
This relates to the mammalian insulin receptor. In particular it relates to the synthesis of the insulin receptor by recombinant cells and to the manufacture and use of certain novel products enabled by the identification and cloning of DNA encoding the insulin receptor. The rapid metabolic effects of insulin as well as its long term growth promoting actions are initiated by the interaction of the hormone with specific, high affinity cell surface receptors¹ ³. The insulin receptor apparent M The α and β subunits of the heterotetrameric insulin receptor derive from a single, glycosylated, polypeptide precursor of approximately 190,000 daltons²⁹ ³¹. Disulfide bridges linking the α and β subunit regions probably begin to form as the protein folds. After being transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus, the precursor is further glycosylated and is then cleaved, followed by its transport to the plasma membrane²⁷. Although similar in purported structure to the IGF 1 receptor²⁸, the insulin receptor differs from the EGF receptor, which functions in the plasma membrane as a single polypeptide chain. The amino acid sequence of the human EGF receptor was recently reported By a novel final purification step we have obtained the human placental insulin receptor in sequenceable grade. Thereafter we determined the nucleotide and imputed complete amino acid sequence of the insulin receptor also abbreviated herein as IR or HIR in the case of human insulin receptor . DNA encoding IR or its mutants is expressed in recombinant cells, thereby enabling the synthesis of a IR compositions having the amino acid sequence of the natural insulin receptor which are entirely free of other proteins of the species of origin and b novel mutant insulin receptors. This DNA or its fragments are useful in the hybridization diagnosis of defective IR DNA or mRNA and for obtaining DNA encoding IR from natural sources. IR and its mutants are therapeutically useful in the treatment of insulin overdose induced hypoglycemia and in the study of the mechanisms of insulin dependent cell metabolism. Known polypeptide fragments of IR are useful for generating antibodies in animals which are capable of binding IR in predetermined domains. These antibodies are useful, for example, as therapeutic agents and as components in diagnostic assays for IR and its mutants. The DNA species provided herein are novel. cDNA which encodes IR is obtained by reverse transcription of mRNA from cells. Accordingly, it contains no introns and is free of any flanking regions encoding other proteins of the organism from which the mRNA originated. Chromosomal DNA encoding IR is obtained by probing genomic DNA libraries with the IR cDNA or its fragments. Chromosomal DNA encoding IR in its entirety is excised free of the normal chromosomal flanking regions encoding other proteins, but it may contain introns. The isolated IR DNA is readily modified by substitution, deletion or insertion of nucleotides, thereby resulting in novel DNA sequences encoding IR or its derivatives. These modified sequences are used to produce mutant IR or to enhance the expression of IR species. In processes for the synthesis of IR, DNA which encodes IR is ligated into a replicable reproducible vector, the vector used to transform host cells, the host cells cultured and IR recovered from the culture. The IR species which are capable of synthesis herein include mature amino terminal IR, preIR and IR derivatives including a fusion proteins wherein IR or any fragment thereof including mature IR is linked to other proteins or polypeptides by a peptide bond at the amino and or carboxyl terminal amino acids of IR or its fragments, b IR fragments, including mature IR or fragments of preIR in which any preprotein amino acid is the amino terminal amino acid of the fragment, c mutants of IR or its fragments wherein one or more amino acid residues are substituted, inserted or deleted, and or d methionyl or modified methionyl such as formyl methionyl or other blocked methionyl species amino terminal addition derivatives of the foregoing proteins, fragments or mutants. Ordinarily, mammalian cells are transformed with a vector containing the sequence of mature IR or its fragments or mutants linked at its 5 end to the IR presequence or other secretory leader recognized by eukaryotic cells, the cell cultured, and mature IR, fragments or mutants are recovered from the culture. IR is secreted by expression of an IR mutant in mammalian cells where the transmembrane sequence has been deleted or substituted by a hydrophilic domain. Also within the scope of this invention are derivatives of IR other than variations in amino acid sequence or glycosylation. Such derivatives are characterized by covalent or aggregative association with chemical moieties. The derivatives generally fall into three classes Salts, side chain and terminal residue covalent modifications, and adsorption complexes, e.g. with cell membranes. Antibodies against predetermined fragments of IR are raised by immunization of animals with conjugates of the fragments with immunogenic proteins. Monoclonal antibodies are prepared from cells secreting desired antibody. These antibodies are screened for insulin like activity on normal or defective receptors. Recombinant IR or IR antibodies are purified and then combined for therapeutic use with physiologically innocuous stabilizers and excipients, sterile filtered and placed into dosage form as by lyophilization in dosage vials or storage in stabilized aqueous preparations. Within the scope herein are derivatives of antibodies which are not complement binding. IR compositions are administered to animals in therapeutically effective doses to neutralize excessive circulating insulin, as for example in overdose emergencies. Suitable dosages will be apparent to the artisan in the therapeutic context. Similarly, anti IR compositions having insulin like activity are administered as required to induce metabolism of blood glucose. Fig. 1a is a schematic diagram of a cDNA clone λHIR P12 encoding HIR. Indicated are the single internal Fig. 1b depicts the nucleotide sequence of the HIR precursor cDNA and its deduced amino acid sequence. Amino acids numbered starting at His 1 of the proreceptor sequence are preceded by a 27 residue signal sequence. The experimentally determined amino terminal sequences of the insulin receptor α and β subunits are underlined. Emphasized are the putative transmembrane sequence black bar , consensus sequences for N linked glycosylation open bars , cysteine residues shaded and the precursor processing site boxed . Fig. 2a depicts the Northern hybridization analysis of placental mRNA by Northern blot analysis. Fig. 2b depicts a Southern blot analysis of placental genomic DNA. Fig. 3 shows the results of hydropathy analysis of the 1370 amino acid long pre insulin receptor sequence. Landmarks within the sequence are indicated schematically signal sequence a , cysteine rich region b , precursor processing site c , transmembrane sequence d and tyrosine kinase domain e . Fig. 4 is a schematic comparison of the insulin and EGF receptors. Regions of high Cys residue concentration are shown as hatched boxes, transmembrane domains as black boxes, and single cysteine residues, that are possibly involved in formation of the α2 β2 insulin receptor complex, as black circles. Fig. 5 is a comparison of oncogene and human EGF receptor sequences with that of HIR in the cytoplasmic domain of the insulin receptor beta subunit. For the purposes herein, IR is defined as a protein or polypeptide which is substantially homologous with the amino acid sequence depicted in Fig. 1b or a fragment thereof, excluding any protein or polypeptide which exhibits substantially the same or lesser homology to the selected Fig. 1b sequence than does the insulin like growth factor receptor IGFR , epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR or the oncogenes v abel, v svc, v fes, v fms, v ros or v erb B. Ordinarily insulin receptor polypeptides will be about from 40 to 100 percent homologous to the Fig. 1b sequence, preferably 80 to 90 percent homologous, and they will exhibit at least some biological activity in common with the insulin receptor of Fig. 1b. Biological activity shall include, but is not limited to, insulin binding, ATP binding, protein phosphorylation activity and cross reactivity with anti IR antibodies raised against IR from natural i.e., nonrecombinant sources. Homology is determined by optimizing residue matches by introducing gaps as required but without considering conservative substitutions as matches. This definition is intended to include natural allelic variations in IR sequence. IR includes the insulin receptors of animals other than humans, PreIR is a species of IR included within the foregoing definition. It is characterized by the presence in the molecule of a signal or leader polypeptide which serves to post translationally direct the protein to a site inside or outside of the cell. Generally, the signal polypeptide which will not have IR activity in its own right is proteolytically cleaved from a residual protein having IR activity as part of the secretory process in which the protein is transported into the host cell periplasm or culture medium. The signal peptide may be microbial or mammalian including the native, 27 residue presequence , but it preferably is mammalian. Derivatives of IR included herein are amino acid sequence mutants, glycosylation variants and covalent or aggregative conjugates with other chemical moieties. Covalent derivatives are prepared by linkage of functionalities to groups which are found in the IR amino acid side chains or at the N or C termini, by means known in the art. These derivatives may, for example, include aliphatic esters or amides of the carboxyl terminus or residues containing carboxyl side chains, O acyl derivatives of hydroxyl group containing residues, and N acyl derivatives of the amino terminal amino acid or amino group containing residues, e.g. lysine or arginine. Acyl groups are selected from the group of alkyl moieties including C3 to C18 normal alkyl , thereby forming alkanoyl aroyl species. A major group of derivatives are covalent conjugates of IR or its fragments with other proteins or polypeptides. These derivatives are synthesized in recombinant culture as N or C terminal fusions or by the use of difunctional agents known Covalent or aggregative derivatives are useful as immunogens, reagents in immunoassay or for affinity purification procedures of insulin or other binding ligands. For example, IR is insolubilized by covalent bonding to cyanogen bromide activated Sepharose by methods known Mutant IR derivatives include the predetermined, i.e. site specific, mutations of IR or its fragments. Mutant IR is defined as a polypeptide otherwise falling within the homology definition for IR as set forth herein but which has an amino acid sequence different from that of IR as found in nature, whether by way of deletion, substitution or insertion. For example, the Arg Lys Arg sequence at residues 720 723, inclusive, may be mutated by deletion in order to produce a single chain receptor or by substitution with another proteolysis recognition sequence more compatible with a recombinant host cell. Similarly, the transmembrane sequence, believed to span residues 918 940, inclusive, is deleted or substituted with hydrophilic residues such as serine to facilitate secretion of the receptor into cell culture medium. While the mutation sites are predetermined, it is unnecessary that the mutation IR mutagenesis is conducted by making amino acid insertions, usually on the order of about from 1 to 10 amino acid residues, or deletions of about from 1 to 30 residues. Substitutions, deletions, insertions or any subcombination may be combined to arrive at a final construct. Insertions include amino or carboxyl terminal fusions. Obviously, the mutations in the DNA must not place coding sequences out of reading frame and preferably will not create complementary regions that could hybridize to produce secondary mRNA structure such as loops or hairpins. Not all mutations in the DNA which encode IR will be expressed in the final product. For example, a major class of DNA substitution mutations are those in which a different secretory leader or signal has been substituted for the native human secretory leader, either by deletions within the leader sequence or by substitutions, wherein most or all of the native leader is exchanged for a leader more likely to be recognized by the intended host. However, the human secretory leader will be recognized by hosts other than human cell lines, most likely in cell culture of higher eukaryotic cells. When the secretory leader is recognized by the host, the fusion protein consisting of IR and the leader ordinarily is cleaved at the leader mature IR peptide bond in the events that lead to secretion of IR or its insertion into the cell membrane. Thus, even though a mutant preIR is synthesized as an intermediate, the resulting IR will be mature. Another major class of DNA mutants that are not expressed as IR derivatives are nucleotide substitutions made to enhance expression, primarily to avoid amino terminal loops in the transcribed mRNA see EP 75,444A, incorporated by reference or to provide codons that are more readily transcribed by the selected host, e.g. the well known Compositions comprising IR may include such substances as the stabilizers and excipients described below, predetermined amounts of proteins from the cell or organism that served as the source of DNA encoding the IR, proteins from other than the IR source cells or organisms, and synthetic polypeptides such as poly L lysine. Recombinant IR which is expressed in allogeneic hosts of course will be expressed completely free of gene source proteins. For example, the expression of human IR in CHO or other higher mammalian cells results in a composition where the receptor is not only free of human proteins but the IR in the culture is not denatured, unlike the partially purified HIR preparations reported in the literature. DNA which encodes IR is obtained by chemical synthesis, by screening reverse transcripts of mRNA from placental cells or cell line cultures, or by screening genomic libraries from any cell. This DNA is covalently labelled with a detectable substance such as a fluorescent group, a radioactive atom or a chemiluminescent group by methods known IR is synthesized in host cells transformed with vectors containing DNA encoding IR. A vector is a replicable DNA construct. Vectors are used herein either to amplify DNA encoding IR and or to express DNA which encodes IR. An expression vector is a replicable DNA construct in which a DNA sequence encoding IR is operably linked to suitable control sequences capable of effecting the expression of IR in a suitable host. The need for such control sequences will vary depending upon the host selected and the transformation method chosen. Generally, control sequences include a transcriptional promoter, an optional operator sequence to control transcription, a sequence encoding suitable mRNA ribosomal binding sites, and sequences which control the termination of transcription and translation. Amplification vectors do not require expression control domains. All that is needed is the ability to replicate in a host, usually conferred by an origin of replication, and a selection gene to facilitate recognition of transformants. Vectors comprise plasmids, viruses including phage , and integratable DNA fragments i.e., fragments integratable into the host genome by recombination . The vector replicates and functions independently of the host genome, or may, in some instances, integrate into the genome itself. In the present specification, vector is generic to plasmid , but plasmids are the most commonly used form of vector at present. However, all other forms of vectors which serve an equivalent function and which are, or become, known in the art are suitable for use herein. Suitable vectors will contain replicon and control sequences which are derived from species compatible with the intended expression host. Transformed host cells are cells which have been transformed or transfected with IR vectors constructed using recombinant DNA techniques. Transformed host cells ordinarily express IR, but host cells transformed for purposes of cloning or amplifying IR DNA do not need to express IR. Expressed IR will be deposited in the cell membrane or secreted into the culture supernatant, depending upon the IR DNA selected. DNA regions are operably linked when they are functionally related to each other. For example, DNA for a presequence or secretory leader is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein which participates in the secretion of the polypeptide a promoter is operably linked to a coding sequence if it controls the transcription of the sequence or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to permit translation. Generally, operably linked means contiguous and, in the case of secretory leaders, contiguous and in reading phase. Suitable host cells are prokaryotes, yeast or higher eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotes include gram negative or gram positive organisms, for example Prokaryotic host vector systems are preferred for the expression of IR fragments that do not require extensive proteolytic and disulfide processing. A plethora of suitable microbial vectors are available. Generally, a microbial vector will contain an origin of replication recognized by the intended host, a promoter which will function in the host and a phenotypic selection gene, for example a gene encoding proteins conferring antibiotic resistance or supplying an autotrophic requirement. Similar constructs will be manufactured for other hosts. Expression vectors should contain a promoter which is recognized by the host organism. This generally means a promoter obtained from the intended host. Promoters most commonly used in recombinant microbial expression vectors include the β lactamase penicillinase and lactose promoter systems Chang Eukaryotic microbes such as yeast cultures may be transformed with IR encoding vectors. Suitable promoting sequences in yeast vectors include the promoters for metallothionein, 3 phosphoglycerate kinase Hitzeman Other promoters, which have the additional advantage of transcription controlled by growth conditions, are the promoter regions for alcohol dehydrogenase 2, isocytochrome C, acid phosphatase, degradative enzymes associated with nitrogen metabolism, and the aforementioned metallothionein and glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase, as well as enzymes responsible for maltose and galactose utilization. In constructing suitable expression plasmids, the termination sequences associated with these genes are also ligated into the expression vector 3 of the IR coding sequences to provide polyadenylation and termination of the mRNA. Cultures of cells derived from multicellular organisms are the preferred hosts for recombinant IR synthesis. This is particularly so for mature IR or the IR α or β chains as extensive host cell processing is required. In principal, any higher eukaryotic cell culture is workable, whether from vertebrate or invertebrate culture. However, mammalian cells are preferred. Propagation of such cells in cell culture has become a routine procedure in recent years The transcriptional and translational control sequences in expression vectors to be used in transforming vertebrate cells are often provided by viral sources. For example, commonly used promoters are derived from polyoma, Adenovirus 2, and most preferably Simian Virus 40 SV40 . The early and late promoters are particularly useful because both are obtained easily from the virus as a fragment which also contains the SV40 viral origin of replication Fiers An origin of replication may be provided either by construction of the vector to include an exogenous origin, such as may be derived from SV40 or other viral e.g. Polyoma, Adenovirus, VSV, or BPV source, or may be provided by the host cell chromosomal replication mechanism. If the vector is integrated into the host cell chromosome, the latter is often sufficient. Rather than using vectors which contain viral origins of replication, one can transform mammalian cells by the method of cotransformation with a selectable marker and the IR DNA. An example of a suitable selectable marker is dihydrofolate reductase DHFR or thymadine kinase. Such markers are proteins, generally enzymes that enable the identification of transformant cells, i.e., cells which were competent to take up exogenous DNA. Generally, identification is by survival of transformants in culture medium that is toxic or from which the cells cannot obtain critical nutrition without having taken up the marker protein. In selecting a preferred host mammalian cell for transfection by vectors which comprise DNA sequences encoding both IR and DHFR, it is appropriate to select the host according to the type of DHFR protein employed. If wild type DHFR protein is employed, it is preferable to select a host cell which is deficient in DHFR thus permitting the use of the DHFR coding sequence as a marker for successful transfection in selective medium which lacks hypoxanthine, glycine, and thymidine, critical nutrients that are not available without DHFR. An appropriate host cell in this case is the Chinese hamster ovary CHO cell line deficient in DHFR activity, prepared and propagated as described by Urlaub and Chasin, 1980, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA Note that if DNA encoding DHFR protein with low binding affinity for methotrexate MTX is used as the controlling sequence, it is not necessary to use DHFR resistant cells. Because the mutant DHFR is resistant to MTX, MTX containing media can be used as a means of selection provided that the host cells are themselves MTX sensitive. Most eukaryotic cells which are capable of absorbing MTX appear to be methotrexate sensitive. One such useful cell line is a CHO line, CHO K1 ATCC No. CCL 61 . Other methods suitable for adaptation to the synthesis of IR in recombinant vertebrate cell culture include those described in M J. Gething HIR synthesized in recombinant culture is characterized by the presence of non human cell components, including proteins, in amounts and of a character which depend upon the purification steps taken to recover HIR from the culture. These components ordinarily will be of yeast, procaryotic or non human higher eukaryotic origin and and preferably are present in innocuous contaminant quantities, on the order of less than about 1 percent by weight. Further, recombinant cell culture enables the production of IR absolutely free of homologous proteins. Homologous proteins are those which are normally associated with the IR as it is found in nature in its species of origin, e.g. in cells, cell exudates or body fluids. For example, a homologous protein for HIR is human serum albumin. Heterologous proteins are the converse, i.e. they are not naturally associated or found in combination with the IR in question. IR or anti IR is prepared for administration by mixing IR or anti IR having the desired degree of purity with physiologically acceptable carriers. Such carriers will be nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed. Ordinarily, the preparation of such compositions entails combining the IR with buffers, antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, low molecular weight less than about 10 residues polypeptides, proteins, amino acids, carbohydrates including glucose or dextrins, chelating agents such as EDTA, glutathione and other stabilizers and excipients. IR compositions are administered to counteract insulin overdose or to adsorb autoimmune anti IR antibodies. The route of administration is intravenous and dose is measured by amelioration of hypoglycemia, i.e., increases in blood sugar or, in the case of anti IR antibody therapy, by insulin efficacy. IR compositions used in the emergency therapy for insulin induced hypoglycemia desirably are combined with conventional agents such as i.v. dextrose used to treat insulin overdose. IR produced by recombinant techniques also is useful in preparing receptor affinity columns for the purification of insulin. In order to simplify the Examples certain frequently occurring methods may be referenced by shorthand phrases. Plasmids are designated by a low case p preceded and or followed by capital letters and or numbers. The starting plasmids herein are commercially available, are publically available on an unrestricted basis, or can be constructed from such available plasmids in accord with published procedures. In addition, other equivalent plasmids are known in the art and will be apparent to the ordinary artisan. Digestion of DNA refers to catalytic cleavage of the DNA with an enzyme that acts only at certain locations in the DNA. Such enzymes are called restriction enzymes, and the sites for which each is specific is called a restriction site. Partial digestion refers to incomplete digestion by a restriction enzyme, i.e., conditions are chosen that result in cleavage of some but not all of the sites for a given restriction endonuclease in a DNA substrate. The various restriction enzymes used herein are commercially available and their reaction conditions, cofactors and other requirements as established by the enzyme suppliers were used. Restriction enzymes commonly are designated by abbreviations composed of a capital letter followed by other letters and then, generally, a number representing the microorganism from which each restriction enzyme originally was obtained. In general, and unless otherwise provided, about 1 µg of plasmid or DNA fragment is used with about 1 unit of enzyme in about 20 µl of buffer solution. Appropriate buffers and substrate amounts for particular restriction enzymes are specified by the manufacturer. Incubation times of about 1 hour at 37 C are ordinarily used, but may vary in accordance with the supplier s instructions. After incubation, protein is removed by extraction with phenol and chloroform, and the digested nucleic acid is recovered from the aqueous fraction by precipitation with ethanol. Digestion with a restriction enzyme infrequently is followed with bacterial alkaline phosphatase hydrolysis of the terminal 5 phosphates to prevent the two restriction cleaved ends of a DNA fragment from circularizing or forming a closed loop that would impede insertion of another DNA fragment at the restriction site. Unless otherwise stated, digestion of plasmids is not followed by 5 terminal dephosphorylation. Procedures and reagents for dephosphorylation are conventional T. Maniatis Recovery or isolation of a given fragment of DNA from a restriction digest means separation of the digest on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, identification of the fragment of interest by comparison of its mobility versus that of marker DNA fragments of known molecular weight, removal of the gel section containing the desired fragment, and separation of the gel from DNA. This procedure is known generally. For example, see R. Lawn Southern Analysis is a method by which the presence of DNA sequences in a digest or DNA containing composition is confirmed by hybridization to a known, labelled oligonucleotide or DNA fragment. For the purposes herein, unless otherwise provided, Southern analysis shall mean separation of digests on 1 percent agarose, denaturation and transfer to nitrocellulose by the method of E. Southern, 1975, J. Mol. Biol. Transformation means introducing DNA into an organism so that the DNA is replicable, either as an extrachromosomal element or chromosomal integrant. Unless otherwise provided, the method used herein for transformation of Ligation refers to the process of forming phosphodiester bonds between two double stranded nucleic acid fragments T. Maniatis Preparation of DNA from transformants means isolating plasmid DNA from microbial culture. Unless otherwise provided, the alkaline SDS method of Maniatis Oligonucleotides are short length single or double stranded polydeoxynucleotides which are chemically synthesized by known methods and then purified on polyacrylamide gels. All literature citations are expressly incorporated by reference. The insulin receptor was purified from human placental membrane preparations by chromatography on wheat germ agglutinin agarose and insulin agarose as described previously²³, except that phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride PMSF was used to inhibit proteolysis elution from wheat germ agglutinin was performed at 4 C and the protein was eluted from the insulin column with 0.5 percent SDS. Chromatography on hydroxylapatite in SDS⁴³ was used to concentrate the partially purified receptor as follows. The insulin agarose eluate was diluted to less than 0.2 percent SDS and made 0.01 M in sodium phosphate, pH 6.4, and 1 mM in dithiothreitol and passed over a three ml column of hydroxylapatite at 37 C bound protein was eluted with 0.6 M sodium phosphate, pH 6.4, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 percent SDS. Purification of the subunits was obtained by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after dialysis against 0.1 percent SDS. Samples were electrophoresed on seven percent gels with 1 mM sodium thioglycolate in the upper reservoir buffer, and bands were excised from the Coomassie blue stained gel and electroeluted as described⁴⁴. Quantitation of the alpha and beta subunits was based on a determination of the staining intensity of individual bands with Coomassie blue after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Staining was determined by laser densitometry Model 2202 Ultroscan, LKB and the receptor bands were compared with known amounts of standard proteins myosin, beta galactosidase, and phosphorylase B run on the same gel. However, particularly in the case of the beta subunit the protein sequence analysis results suggest that our estimate of the amount of receptor is low. Purified protein was applied to the vapor phase protein sequencer Model 470A, Applied Biosystems described by Hewick The double stranded hybridization probes were prepared using an automatic DNA synthesizer Biosearch . Short overlapping oligonucleotides were synthesized and purified by acrylamide gel electrophoresis. Approximately 10 pmol of each oligonucleotide were phosphorylated in separate reactions using three fold excess of τ³²P ATP Amersham and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Full length probes were prepared by combining the 5 end labeled oligonucleotides and ligation with 2 units of T4 DNA ligase at 20 C for 2 hrs. Analytical examination of the ligation result demonstrated that about 69 80 percent of the DNA had been ligated to probe monomer size. The entire ligation mixture was boiled to separate DNA strands and used for hybridization as described³⁷. Total polyA containing RNA was isolated from frozen term placenta. A clone library 1.5x10⁶ pfu with cDNA 500bp and the λgt10 vector system was prepared as described Initial screening with the α subunit probe detected 15 hybridization positive recombinant phage. Characterization of purified phage DNAs by Nucleotide sequence analysis confirmed that the 1 kb Comparison of final cDNA derived nucleotide sequences with our synthetic probes revealed that the α subunit N terminal probe contained 9 mismatches 86 percent match with the longest stretch of perfect match being 11 bp, and the 57 bp, β subunit N terminal probe contained 12 mismatches 79 percent match and a 12 bp maximum uninterrupted match. No false positives were identified. Based on our cDNA sequence we calculated molecular weights of 155,000 for the pre insulin receptor precursor and 152,000 for the mature precursor. A tetrapeptide ArgLysArgArg at position 720 of the insulin receptor precursor sequence directly precedes the β subunit N terminal sequence Fig. 1b and is believed to represent the cleavage site for the receptor precursor processing enzyme. Omitting this peptidase recognition sequence, the final unmodified subunit molecular weights are predicted to be 82,400 α and 69,700 β . Hydropathy analysis was conducted by scanning the 1370 amino acid long pre insulin receptor precursor sequence using the computer program of Kyte and Doolittle⁴⁶. Landmarks within the sequence are indicated schematically signal sequence a , cysteine rich region b , precursor processing site c , transmembrane sequence d and tyrosine kinase domain e . Hydrophobicity results in positive and hydrophilicity in negative values see Kyte and Doolittle⁴⁶ . The results are shown in Fig. 3. The 719 residue long α subunit sequence Fig. 1b is largely hydrophilic Fig. 3 with a few short hydrophobic stretches, none of which are long enough to qualify as potential membrane anchor sequences. Fifteen consensus sequences for asparagine linked glycosylation Asn x Ser Thr are evenly distributed over the 719 residue long α subunit region, which is also characterized by an unusually large number 37 of cysteine residues. Twenty six of the cysteines are concentrated between residues 155 and 312 Fig. 1b and are contained within a rather hydrophilic domain Fig. 3 . Although in most cases there is no direct evidence as to which of the potential asparagine linked carbohydrate attachment sites are in fact glycosylated, our failure to detect the asparagines at positions 16 and 7 of the alpha and beta subunits, respectively, during protein sequencing strongly suggests that these two sites are glycosylated. The 620 amino acid long β subunit sequence contains only nine cysteine residues 1.5 percent and can be divided into 3 domains. The amino terminal 194 residue long domain contains 4 potential asparagine linked glycosylation sites and four cysteine residues. An adjacent stretch of 23 26 highly hydrophobic amino acids 915 or 918 940 is believed to represent the single transmembrane domain that anchors the insulin receptor in the membrane. The transmembrane sequence is flanked at its C terminal end by three basic amino acids ArgLysArg Fig. 1b , which are part of the 403 residue long carboxy terminal domain that contains two potential N linked glycosylation sites as well as a typical number of cysteine residues. Northern blot analysis³⁸ was undertaken for polyA RNA 5 µg isonated from mouse 3T3 LI fibroblasts before a and after differentiation into adipocytes⁴⁰ b and human term placenta tissue c after separation on a formaldehyde containing one percent agarose gel and transfer to nitrocellulose. Rat ribosomal RNA was used as a size marker. The filter was hybridized with radiolabelled insulin receptor cDNA fragments⁴⁷ 1010 bp and 4169 bp Northern blot hybridization³⁸ analysis using polyA RNA from term placenta, as well as fetal placenta 20 week and a human lymphoblast cell line IM 9 , yielded a complex pattern of five common hybridization bands, 8.2 kb, 7.3 kb, 6.5 kb, 5.5 kb and 4.6 kb in length Fig. 2A . A faint, 2.9 kb band was also detected, but was present only in term placenta and IM 9 RNAs. The hybridization signal intensities for the bands was different for each band, indicating that either variable amounts of different length mRNAs are synthesized from the same gene, or that different but related genes are transcribed to yield multiply sized mRNAs. To further investigate the identity of mRNAs from placenta and IM 9 cells which hybridize with our 5.2 kb insulin receptor cDNA probe, we used a variety of cDNA probe fragments as hybridization probes in Northern blot hybridization experiments. In all cases, at least all of the four largest transcripts 8.2, 7.3, 6.5 and 5.5 kb were detected. After treatment with dexamethasone and isobutyl methylxanthine, mouse 3T3 LI fibroblasts differentiate into adipocytes, in a process which leads to a ten to twenty fold increase in the number of insulin receptor molecules on their surfaces. To determine the number of insulin receptor genes present in the human genome, Southern blot analyses³⁵ were carried out using an 857 bp A gel purified This example describes the method generally usable for deletional mutagenesis of IR. The following embodiment describes the deletion of the transmembrane region TMR of HIR. The gel purified The synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides 5 GCTGCCTCTTTCTTTTTGCAATATTTG 3 Δ complementary to the HIR coding regions immediately proximal and distal to the TMR , 5 GAAGTCACAACACTAACCTTC3 loop complementary to a portion of the TMR , 5 AGAAGCGTAAAGCGGTCC3 a sequencing primer complementary to the region encloding HIR amino acid residues 950 955 and 5 GTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC3 LAC , regularly used as a sequencing primer on recombinant phage M13 DNA were prepared by the method of Crea The oligonucleotides were phosphorylated as described in Adelman Phosphorylated Δ and LAC are annealed to pSalHIR and primer extended as described in Adelman Other deletional, substitution and insertional mutations e.g. mutations of residues 720 723, are prepared in similar fashion and or by the use of synthetic oligonucleotide inserts using the methods of U.S. patent application 614,617 U.K. patent application 2,130,219A R. Wallace In this contemplated example, the peptides described in the following Table I are synthesized by the Merrifield solid phase synthesis technique 68 and conjugated to the proteins scheduled in Table I using the indicated bifunctional agents in accord with conventional practice. Other bifunctional cross linking agents are known and useable in the preparation of immunogenic conjugates. Examples include glutaraldehyde, succinic anhydride, SOCl₂, and R N C NR. Other proteins than those enumerated above are useful. They preferably will be heterologous to the species to be immunized, otherwise the immune response likely will be of low titer if at all. Preferably, the IR polypeptide fragments chosen are selected from the α subunit, although fragments from the ATP binding, protein phosphokinase and autophosphorylation regions of the receptor are included within the scope hereof. Animals are immunized against the immunogenic conjugates by combining 1 mg or 1 µg of conjugate for rabbits or mice, respectively with 3 volumes of Freund s complete adjuvant and injecting the solution intradermally at multiple sites. One month later animals are boosted with 1 5 to 1 10 the original amount of conjugate in Freund s complete adjuvant by subcutaneous injection at multiple sites. 7 to 14 days later animals are bled and the serum assayed for anti HIR titer. Animals are boosted until the titer plateaus. Preferably, the animal is boosted with the conjugate of the same IR polypeptide, but conjugated to a different protein and or through a different crosslinking agent. Monoclonal antibodies are prepared by recovering spleen cells from immunized animals and immortilizing the cells in conventional fashion, e.g. by fusion with myeloma cells or by EB virus transformation and screening for clones expressing the desired antibody. Antibodies which are capable of binding to or in the steric vicinity of the IR insulin binding site are identified by immobilizing rabbit anti IR β subunit on goat anti rabbit IgG coated microtiter wells, adding dilutions of test sample in ¹²⁵I insulin containing PBS to the coated wells, incubating overnight, aspirating the test sample from the wells, washing with PBS, and determining the radioactivity remaining in the wells by gamma counting. Test samples containing desired antibodies are indicated by increases in insulin displacement at higher sample concentrations. Similar assays are conducted to identify antibodies which bind to the ATP binding, protein phosphokinase active site, and autophosphorylation domains of IR. Diabetes is believed to be primarily a function of inadequate insulin levels or defective or insufficient insulin receptors. For example, an insulin receptor may be defective because of an inability to bind insulin in a fashion that will activate the tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor. This may result, for example, from dominant point mutations in the insulin receptor binding region of IR. Knowledge of the amino acid sequence for IR has now made possible the generation of antibodies against selected regions of the receptor which can be methodically screened for insulin like or insulin agonist activity. Such antibodies or their derivatives are useful as insulin substitutes for the therapeutic treatment of diabetes stemming from defective receptor binding of insulin. While anti insulin receptor antibodies are known that induce glucose uptake by test cells⁵⁰, the method herein makes it possible to raise such antibodies against predetermined sites on the IR molecule, thereby avoiding the generation of contaminant antibodies having undesirable side effects Suitable candidate antibodies such as those prepared above, are screened by preparing IR in conventional fashion from a tissue sample obtained from a diabetic patient found partly or wholly refractory to insulin. It is unnecessary to purify the IR to the sequenceable grade described elsewhere herein. It is satisfactory to purify the IR by known methods up to insulin affinity adsorption which in any case probably would be ineffective where the defective receptor is incapable of binding insulin . The IR preparation is combined in aqueous solution with a 0.1 5 mg ml of a protein tyrosine kinase substrate such as Glu Ala Tyr n⁴⁹ or histone H2B, b gamma ³²P ATP and c aliquots of test sample and varying dilutions of the test sample candidate antibody in control antibody solution so as to prepare a curve in which essentially the same antibody concentration is present for each data point. The assay is conducted generally as described previously⁴⁹, except that the IR need not be immobilized. Normal antibody from the animal species in which the candidate antibody was raised was prepared in the same way as the candidate antibody to serve as a negative control. After incubation the proteins in the solution are precipitated and washed free of labelled ATP, or otherwise separated from labelled ATP as for example by gel electrophoresis. The radioactivity found in the protein fractions from the varying antibody dilutions and negative control is compared. Candidate antibody which induces or stimulates incorporation of ³²P into protein is suitable for therapeutic use as an insulin substitute. Altenatively, a less direct assay will be the measurement of cellular glucose uptake rates in the presence of dilutions of the candidate antibody. It is prefered to use the Fab fragments of the selected antibody because such fragments, even though divalent, will not bind complement and therefore will not participate in potentially toxic autoimmune responses. Such fragments are obtained by enzymatic digestion of the antibody using conventional methods.
