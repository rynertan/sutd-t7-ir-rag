# METHOD AND COMPOSITIONS FOR ACIDIZING AND FRACTURING WELLS

## Abstract
Gelled acid compositions suitable for matrix acidizing or fracture acidizing of subterranean formations and meth ods of using the composition in these operations are provided wherein the compositions comprise water, water dispersible acrylamide derived polymer, an acid and an aldehyde precursor which hydrolyzes in aqueous acid media to produce aldehydes which in turn react with the polymer and gels the resulting mixture.
