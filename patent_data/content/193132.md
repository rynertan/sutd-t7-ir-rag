The present invention comprehends all optical isomers and reacemic forms of the compounds of the present invention where such compounds have chiral centers in addition to those of the labdane nucleus. The novel labdanes of the present invention are synthesized by the processes illustrated in Reaction Scheme A and B. To prepare a basic labdane 3 wherein R7 is alkanoyl and R19 and R2 are as hereinbeforedescribed, a , dihydroxylabdane 2 wherein R7 is alkanoyl is condensed with a formamide dialkylacetal of formula 16 EMI5.1 wherein R21 is alkyl and R19 and R2 are as hereinbeforedescribed to provide a basic labdane 3. The condensation is preferably performed in the absence of an added solvent, excess formamide dialkylacetal serving both as the reactant and solvent. A dipolar aprotic solvent such as dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, hexamethylphosphoramide or dimethylsulfoxide may be employed, however, as the reaction medium. The temperature at which the condensation is conducted is not critical. A condensation temperature within the range of about 250 to about 1BBOC is generally employed to assure a reasonable rate of reaction. A temperature of about 450 to about 65 0C is preferred. To prepare a labdane of formula 4 wherein R19 and R2g are as before and R6 is alkanoyl, a alkanoyloxy 6 hydroxy labdane 3 is rearranged to a alkanoyloxy hydroxylabdane 4. The rearrangement Is conveniently performed in an aqueous alkanol containing an alkali metal hydroxide. Among alkanols there may be mentioned methanol, ethanol, 1 and 2 propanol and t butanol.Methanol is preferred. Among alkali metal hydroxides there may be included lithium, sodium and potassium hydroxide. Sodium hydroxide is preferred. While the rearrangement is preferably performed at about ambient temperature, it may be conducted at a reduced temperature within the range of about 0 to about 25 C, or at an elevated temperature of about 250 to 350C. The rearrangement may preferably be effected, for example, by treating 3 with lithium 1,1,1,3,3,3 hexamethyldisilazide in an ethereal solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, 1,2 dimethoxyethane or bis 2 methoxyethyl ether at a reduced temperature of about BOC. To furnish a basic labdane formula 5 wherein R19 and R2 are as above, a 6 alkanoyloxy hydroxylabdane 4 is hydrolyzed to the 6 , g dihydroxylabdane 5. The hydrolysis is carried out in an aqueous alkanol such as aqueous methanol, ethanol, 1 or 2 propanol or t butanol, aqueous methanol being preferred, containing an alkali carbonate such as lithium, sodium or potassium carbonate, potassium carbonate being prefered, at a hydrolysis temperature within the range of about 10 to about 75 C, a hydrolysis temperature of about 250C being preferred. A 6 dihydroxylabdane of formula 5 may also be prepared by hydrolysis of a g alkanoyloxy hydroxylabdane of formula 3 by means of the hereinbeforedescribed processes for the conversion of 4 to 5. To introduce a , sulfita or f carbonate function into the basic labdane nucleus, i.e., to prepare a compound of formula Z wherein X is SO or CO, respectively, a dihydroxylabdane of formula 5 is treated with a compound of formula 11. HalZHal 11 wherein Hal is bromo or chloro, preferably chloro, and Z isSO or CO in the presence of an organic base such as trimethyl or triethylamine, pyridine, lutidine or collidine at a reduced temperature within the range of about 250 to about 25 0C. The preferred organic base is pyridine and the preferred reaction temperature is about BOC. To elaborate, a basic labdane characterized by the presence of aminoacyloxy and aminoacetal moieties, a hydroxylabdane 5 is esterified with an aminoacid of formula 12. R11R12NCHR1 3CO2H 12 wherein R11, R12 and R13 are as hereinbeforedescribed. The esterification is conveniently effected in a halocarbon such as dichloromethane or tirchioromethane in the presence of a carbodiimide such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and a catalyst such as 4 N,N dimethylamino pyridine at a reaction temperature within the range of about 80 to about 580C. Dichloromethane and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide are the preferred halocarbon and carbodiimide, respectively. A reaction temperature of about 250C is also preferred. A hydrohalide of the aminoacid, for example, an aminoacid hydrochloride, may be employed in the process for the esterification of a hydroxylabdane. To construct a basic labdane characterized by an aminoacyloxy function at the 3 position and a free hydroxy group at the position of the labdane nucleus, i.e., to synthesize a compound of formula 9 wherein R11, R12 and R13 are as hereinbeforedefined, alkanoyloxylabdane 2 is hydrolyzed under conventional conditions utilizing an alkali metal carbonate such as sodium carbonate in an aqueous alkanol such as methanol at a reaction temperature of about 250C to the known 1 alpha ,6ss,2ss,9 alpha tetrahydroxy labdane 8 which is estetified with a compound of the formula 12. R11R12NCHR13CO2H 12 wherein R11, R12 and R13 are as hereinbeforedefined under reaction conditions substantially similar to those employed for the conversion of 5 to 6 described above. Alternatively, basic labdanes of formula 2 may be prepared by hydrolysis of the amincacetal moiety of labdanes of formula 6.The hydrolysis may be accomplished by treating an aminoacetal of formula 6 with an alkanoic acid such as acetic or propanoic acid, preferably acetic acid, in an aqueous alkanol such as methanol, ethanol or 1 or 2 propanol, preferably aqueous methanol, at a temperature within the range of about 9 to 50 C, preferably at a temperature of about 25 0C. Basic labdanes of formula q are also prepared by desilylation of a compound of formula 15. The rempval of the silyl group is achieved by, for example treating the 1 alpha sily oxylabdane S with aqueous hydrogen fluoride in acetonitrile at a temperature of about 25 0C. To gain entry into the labdane system h aving a basic moiety at the 2ss position and a silyloxy group at the 1 alpha position, i.e., to provide basic labdanes of formula 15 wherein B3, R4, R5, R11,R12, and R13 are as above, a 2ss alkanoyloxy 2 alpha hydroxylabdane 2 is silylated to a 2ss alkanoyloxy 1 alpha silyloxylabdane 13 which is hydrolyzed to a 1ss hydroxy 1 alpha silyloxylabdane 14 and converted to a basic labdane 15. To effect the silylation, one treats a 1 alpha hydroxylabdane 2 with a N trialkylsilyl N alkyltrifloroacetamide of formula 16 R3R4R5S,i NR23COCCZ3 16 wherein R3, R4 and R5 are as above and Rz3 is alkyl, preferably a trifluoroacetamide wherein R23 is alkyl1 most preferablyN t butoxydimethylsilyl N methyltrifluoroacetamide, in a dipolar aprotic solvent such as dinethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, hexamethylphosphoramide or dimethylsulfoxide, preferably dimethylformamide, at a temperature within the range of about 0 to 75 C, preferably at a reaction temperature of about 250C, to afford a compound of formula 13. The hydrolysis is accomplished by treating a alkanoyloxy 1 alpha trialkylsilyloxylabdane 13 with an alkali metal carbonate in an aqueous alkanol. Included among alkali metal carbonates are lithium, sodium and potassium carbonate. Included among alkanols are methanol, ethanol, 1 and 2 propanol and t butanol. Potassium carbonate and methanol are the preferred alkali metal carbonate and alkanol. While the reaction temperature is not narrowly critical, it is preferable to perform the hydrolysis at an elevated temperature within the range of about 60 to about 100 C. A hydrolysis temperature of about 8BOC is most preferred. The introduction of the basic moiety at the 2ss position of the labdane nucleus, i.e., the conversion of a 2ss hydroxylabdane 14 to a i aminoalkylcarbonyloxylabdane 15 is achieved by processes substantially similar to those employed for the conversion of g hydroxylabdane 5 to i aminoalkylcarbonyloxylabdane 6. For example, one treats a ahydroxylabdane 14 with an aminoacid 12, free or as the hydrohalide salt, in a halocarbon solvent such as dichloromethane in the presence of a catalyst such as 4 dimethylaminopyridine and a carbodiimide such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide at about ambient temperature ca.250C to provide a compound of formula 15. To synthesize a labdane having a 6 ffi sulfite or carbonate function and a 1 alpha hydroxy group, i.e., a compound of formula 17 wherein X is SO or CO, a g silyloxylabdane of formula 14 is converted to a 1 alpha silyloxylabdane 6ss,1ss sulfite or carbonate of formula 16 by processes substantially similar to those employed for the conversion of a compound of formula 5 to a compound of formula 7 followed by desilylation by the process described above for the transformation of a 1 alpha silyloxylabdane 15 to a 4 hydroxylabdane 9. The labdane starting materials for the processes of the present invention, i.e., labdanes of formula 3 wherein R7 is hydrogen or a group of the formula R8Ct wherein R8 is as herein beforedescribed, are described in U.S. patent 4,134,986, issuedJanuary 16, 1979 to B.
