# Improved heat shield element for a brake.

## Abstract
The present invention comprises a heat shield element 60 having a central opening 62 for receiving the reduced diameter portion 40 of a piston 16 of a disc brake 10 . The heat shield element 60 is disposed between a metallic retainer ring heat shield 50 and the convolutions of a flexible boot seal 30 . The retainer ring heat shield 50 maintains the axial position of the heat shield element 60 and a bead 36 of the boot seal 30 , such that the heat shield element 60 , which extends radially outwardly of the retainer 50 , provides effective shielding of the boot 30 .
