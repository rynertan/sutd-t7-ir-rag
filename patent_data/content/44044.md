# Scaffolding device.

## Abstract
The invention is concerned with a clamping device for clamping together a scaffolding pole 19 and the flange 20 of a construction member. The device comprises a body part 10 having an arcuate seat 25 , and a body part 11 having an arcuate seat 11a , the two body parts being connected together at one end thereof for relative pivotal movement, and the device comprising clamping means 14, 15, 18 to secure the body parts in clamping engagement with the scaffolding pole. The arcuate seats 11a and 25 are spaced apart in the axial direction, and the body part 10 comprises an integral extension portion 28 , which extends generally parallel to the longitudinal axis, such that the arcuate seat 11a lies in the axial direction between the arcuate seat 25 and a flange engaging surface 29 of the extension portion 28 . In this manner by tightening a single nut 18 the clamping means may be operated to secure the clamping device to the scaffolding pole, and simultaneously clamp the flange 20 between the extension portion 28 and the scaffolding pole.
