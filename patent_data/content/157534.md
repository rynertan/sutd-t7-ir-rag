# Driving circuit for radio frequency dryer.

## Abstract
A driving circuit for supplying a radio frequency electrical signal to the applicator section of a radio frequency dryer 12 includes a voltage controlled oscillator 14 , supplying a signal to an amplifier circuit 20 . The amplifier circuit supplies an amplified signal to the applicator section of the dryer 12 via an impedance match circuit 42 . The signal supplied to the ap plicator section is compared in phase with the output of the voltage controlled oscillator 14 and phase deviations are uti lized to produce a signal which controls the frequency of the voltage controlled oscillator output, such that the applicator section of the dryer 12 is driven at its resonant frequency.
