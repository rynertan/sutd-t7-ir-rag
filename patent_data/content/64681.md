NOVEL RECOMBINANT DNA Background of The InventionThe present invention relates generally to a novel recombinant DNA and more specifically to a recombinant DNA containing a promoter of the tufB gene coding for protein elongation factor Tu of Escherichia coli, a novel recombinant DNA containing the promoter and a gene coding for the biosynthesis of a eukaryotic protein, and a process for producing the eukaryotic protein using the recombinant DNA.For the industrial use of microorganisms, extensive studies and development have heretofore been made on mass production of a eukaryotic protein by introducing a gene coding for the biosynthesis of the protein into a microorganism. In gene recombination technology, the promoter is an important factor and, there is a need for the development of suitable promoters. To this end, it has now been found that the promoter in the tufB gene ofEscherichia coli is an excellent promoter which can promote the synthesis of eukaryotic proteins. Heretofore, there have been no reports of a tufB promoter being recovered from the tufB gene and combined with a gene coding for the synthesis of a eukaryotic protein for the production of the eukaryotic protein by the recatibinant DNA.Summary of the InventionIn accordance with the present invention novel recombinantDNAs are produced using a promoter derived from the tufB gene of Escherichia coli hereinafter referred to as tufB promoter . According to one aspect of the invention, a process for producing eukaryotic protein comprises culturing a microorganism carrying a plasmid containing the tufB promoter of Escherichia coli and a gene coding for said eukaryotic protein and which is capable of producing said eukaryotic protein, in a nutrient medium until recoverable quantities of said protein are accumulated in the culture liquor and thereafter recovering said protein therefrom.The composition of matter aspects of the invention includes recombinant DNAs containing the tufB promoter ofEscherichia coli, including recombinants with a plasmidDNA, recombinants wherein a gene coding for the biosynthesis of eukaryotic protein is combined downstream of the promoter, and recombinants containing a gene coding for the biosynthesis of eukaryotic protein wherein a cleavage site for the restriction endonuclease Cla I is constructed upstream from the gene.Brief Description of the DrawingsFig. 1 is a flow chart for preparing plasmid pTuBlP 5 of the present invent ion, wherein the arrow refers to cleavage sites with restriction endonuclease.

The tufB gene is described in detail in Bacteriol. Rev. Vol. 40, pp.116 167 1976 . Moreover, the tufB gene cloned in plasmid pTUBl of Escherichia coli is described in Miyajima et al., FEBS Letters Vol. 102, No. 2, pp. 207 210 1979 .The tufB promoter is recovered from the tufB gene as follows. Plasmid pTUBl DNA of Escherichia coli which contains the tufB gene Miyajima et al., FEBS Letters Vol.102, No. 2, pp. 207 210 1979 1 is cleaved with Bgl II A G , a restriction endonuclease recognizing AGATCT and described in Nucleic Acids Res., 3, 1747 1976 , and the resulting cohesive end is treated with a DNA polymerase td make a blunt end. The product is then cleaved with Cla I T C , a restriction endonuclease recognizing ATCGAT produced by Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, and a tufB promoter fragment of about 1 kilobase kb is isolated by a known method, for example, the method described in Tabak andFlavell, Nucleic Acids Res., Vol. 5 pp. 2321 2332 1978 .Separately, plasmid pBR 322 DNA gene, 2, 95 1977 is cleaved with Eco RI G A , a restriction endonuclease recognizing GAATTC Methods Mol. Biol., 7, 87 1974 , and the resulting cohesive end is treated with a DNA polymerase to make a blunt end. The product is then cleaved again with Cla I. The resulting fragment and the promoter fragment described above are ligated with T4 DNA ligase by the method described in Weiss et al., J. Biol.Chem. 243, p. 4543 1968 . Thus, plasmid pTuBlP 5 containing the tufB promoter is obtained. Plasmid pTuBlP 5 is illustrated in Fig. 1. Escherichia coli HB101 containing pTuBlP 5 has been deposited with the AmericanType Culture Collection, U.S.A. under accession numberATCC 31878. Since pTuBlP 5 has only one cleavage site forCla I, an objective gene can be conveniently constructed downstream from the tufB promoter.The tufB promoter of the present invention can be used for the production of eukaryotic proteins by combination with a gene coding for the synthesis of eukaryotic proteins.As suitable eukaryotic proteins, any protein may be applied so long as the productivity of the protein is increased when a gene coding for the synthesis of the protein is recombined with upstream tufB promoter and a.microorganism containing the recombinant DNA is cultured.Preferably, genes coding for human interferon, insulin, somatostatin and the like are used.For the production of new recombinant DNAs of the present invention, a vector DNA is required. As the vector DNA, plasmid DNAs or phages derived from Escherichia coli may be used. Preferably, pBR 322, pMB 9, pCR 1 and the like are used. In the present invention, pBR 322 is most preferably used.An example of the process for the production of the novel recombinant DNA of the present invention containing the tufB promoter and a gene coding for the synthesis of eukaryotic protein is described below using as a gene coding for human interferon B1 and as a vector DNA plasmid pBR 322. Initially, a process for the production of plasmid pIFNss 4 which may be conveniently used to combine with the tufB promoter and which contains human interferon ssl is described.Plasmid pTR 56 containing a partially deleted human inteferon 61 gene Taniguchi et al., Proc. Natl. Acad.Sci. USA, Vol. 77, No. 9, pp. 5230 5233 1980 is cleaved with Hind III A A which is a restriction endonuclease recognizing AAGCTT J. Mol Biol., 92, 331 1975 . Separately, 89 nucleotides upstream of the human interferon 61 gene Taniguchi et al., Gene, Vol. 10, pp.11 15 1980 is removed using exonuclease Bal 31 Nucleic Acids Research 5, 1445. 1463 1978 1, and a HindIII linker and a Bam HI linker are combined thereto. The product is combined downstream from a lac portable promoter which is a promoter fragment of ss galactosidase of Escherichia coli and has 105 base pairs References 1 Taniguchi et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, Vol. 77,No. 9, pp. 5230 5233 1980 , 2 Roberts Lauer,Methods in Enzymology, Vol. 68, pp. 473 481 1979 followed by insertion into the plasmid. The thus obtained plasmid is named PIE 208 LR2 refer to Fig. 2 . The PIE 208 LR2 plasmid lacks a part of the interferon gene downstream of the Hinf I cleavage site which is close downstream to the sole Pst I cleavage site present in the gene Taniguchi et al., Proc. Natl. Acad Sci., USA, Vol.77, No. 9, pp. 5230 5233 1980 . The lacking interferon gene is, therefore, supplied by the following step.PIE 208 LR2 is cleaved with Pst I A G which is a restriction endonuclease recognizing CTGCAG Nucleic AcidsRes., 3, 343 1976 . Separately TpIF319 13 DNA Taniguchi et al., Gene, Vol. 10, pp. 11 15 1980 is cleaved with Pst I. Both plasmids are ligated with T4 DNA ligase. The thus obtained recombinant plasmid is named pIFNss 4 refer to Fig. 2 .The interferon gene in pIFNss 4 lacks the DNA coding for 6 amino acids upstream from the DNA necessary for coding mature human interferon ssl. Herein, mature means that intact interferon protein is included in the gene. In order to construct the gene coding for a mature interferon protein, the DNA coding for the 6 amino acids is prepared by a conventional chemical synthetic method, for example, the method described in 1 Tetrahedron Let. Vol. 28, pp.2449 2452 1978 or 2 Nucleic Acids Research, Vol. 8, pp. 5473 5489 1980 . The sequence of the synthesizedDNA is as follows 1 2 3 4 5 6 Met Ser Tyr Asn Leu Leu pCG. ATG AGC TAC AAC TTG CT Is, ill .155 ii TAC TCG ATG TTG AAC GAGCpA plasmid coding for the production of mature human interferon ss1 is constructed using the synthetic DNA, pTuBlP 5 and pIFN 4. In order to combine the interferon gene downstream from the tufB promoter, pTuBlP 5 is cleaved with Cla I and HindIII. Then, pIFNss 4 is cleaved with Hpa II C C which is a restriction endonuclease recognizing CCGG Biochemistry 12, 3055 1973 1 or Hap II C C which is a restriction 6 endonuclease recognizing CCGG Methods Mol. Biol., 7, 113 1974 and Hind III followed by isolating a DNA fragment of about 700 base pairs. The DNA fragment codes for from the 7th to the final amino acids of mature human interferon ssl protein and has a downstream Hind III cleavage site derived from pBR322. A gene coding for whole protein of mature human interferon is is constructed by ligating the Hap II cleavage site of the DNA fragment and the downstream end of the synthetic DNA mentioned above with T4 DNA ligase as illustrated in Fig. 3. The upstream end of the syntheticDNA and the Cla I cleavage site of pTuBlP 5 which is cleaved with Cla I and Hind III above are ligated with T4DNA ligase. Thus, the interferon gene is connected with the tufB promoter. The Hind III cleavage site of pTuBlP 5 is ligated to the Hind III cleavage site of the above mentioned 700 base pair IFN DNA. The constructed plasmid is illustrated in Fig. 3 and named pTuIFNss 5. The thus obtained pTuIFNss 5 plasmid has genes coding for the tufB promoter and whole protein of mature human interferon E as well as genes coding for resistance to ampicillin and tetracycline.The base sequence of the combining sites of the tufB promoter, synthetic DNA and downstream part of interferon gene is illustrated in Fig. 4. For effective initiation of protein synthesis by the ribosome of Escherichia coli, the presence of a Shine Dalgarno SD sequence rich in purine bases upstream of the ATG codon is necessary and the distance between the SD sequence and ATG codon is important. As illustrated in Fig. 4, the sequence between the SD sequence and ATG codon which codes for the first amino acid of interferon gene in pTuIFNss 5 is exactly the same as that in the original tufB gene.The codon used for the 6th amino acid in the human interferon ssl 1 gene is CTT and in the case of the interferon ssl gene constructed with the synthetic DNA, the codon is CTC. Since both codons code for leucine, the amino acid sequence of the mature interferon ssl protein synthesized using pTuIFN 5 should be the same as that of natural human protein. A strain of Escherichia coli is transformed with pTuIFN S5 by the method described in Mandel, M. Higa, A., J. Mol.Biol., 53, 159 162 1970 . The thus obtained transformant is cultured using a conventional method for Escherichia coli to determine the productivity of interferon. The productivity is improved in comparison to a transformant containing plasmid pLG117 previously constructed by the present inventors Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, Vol. 77,No. 9, 5230 5233 1980 . As pTuIFN gives an intact interferon gene by cleaving just before the ATG codon with Cla I and the gene can be readily combined with another promoter, pTuIFN is very useful. Moreover, it is possible to promote the expression of interferon gene by in vitro modification such as deletion of the tufB promoter in pTuIFN beta 5.Certain specific embodiments of the invention are illustrated by the following representative examples reflecting actual experimental data.Example 1Preparation of plasmid pTuBlP 5 In this Example, 260 pg of plasmid pTUBl DNA Miyajima et al., FEBS Letters, Vol. 102, No. 2, pp. 207 210 1979 is incubated at 370C overnight in 500 p1 of a solution consisting of 10 mM Tris ECl pH 7.5 , 6 mM MgC12, 10 mMNaCl, 6mM mercaptoethanol and 100 units of Bgl II product of Bethesda Research Laboratories BRL , USA .

Gen. Virol., Vol. 5, pp. 419 425 1969 . For the measurement, as human cells, GM 258 available from Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository,Camden, N.J., U.S.A., and as challenge virus, encephalomyocardits EMC virus available from the NIH,USA, are used. Interferon activity of the extract of Escherichia coli cells are determined using interferon ss available from the NIH as a control. The average of three measurements is as follows 1 pTuIFNss 5 HB101 1,700 units ml 2 pLG117R HB101 400 units mlIn the case of 1 , 1.0 x 108 cells have a total interferon activity of about 3,000 units and in the case of 2 , 2.5 x 108 cells have a total interferon activity of about 700 units. Therefore, it will be appreciated that the HB101 strain carrying pTuIFNB 5 produces about 10 times more interferon B than that of pLG117R.
