# Catalytic decomposition of hypochlorite using substituted cobalt oxide spinels.

## Abstract
Hypochlorite ions in aqueous solution are catalytically decomposed by the action of a poly metal spinel of cobalt preferably coated on an inert, stable support. The spinel catalyst may contain dispersed therein, optionally, other modifier metal oxides which contribute better adherence of the spinel to the substrate and improve the toughness of the spinel coating. The substituted cobalt spinel conforms generally to the empirical formula M
