# Means and method for removal of seat rings in ball valves.

## Abstract
A ball valve structure has a removable upper cover plate 16 to permit the ball 34 to be removed from the valve body. A separate cam tool 90, Figs. 8 10 after remo val of the cover plate is positioned within the bore of the ball which has been partially rotated from the full open position, and upon a return rotation of the ball with the cam tool therein to a full open position an adjacent spring urged seat ring 58 is cammed away from the ball to a re tracted position. A seat ring retainer 82 is then actuated to hold the seat ring in the retracted position. The cam tool is then utilized in a similar manner to cam the other oppo site seat ring in retracted position. The ball may then be removed with the seat rings for replacement or repair as desired. The seat rings and seals 70 thereon may be re moved and replaced in such a manner without removal of the valve from the flowline in which the valve is posi tioned.
