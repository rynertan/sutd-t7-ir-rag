# Magnetic bubble memory device.

## Abstract
A magnetic bubble memory device consisting of major minor loops comprises at least one boot loop 50 and minor loops 61 . Control of the read out of data stored in the boot loop 50 in bubble form is independent of the minor loops. Header data 53 are stored in the boot loop. Faulty loop data 54 of the minor loops is stored in the minor loops with a certain positional relationship to the header data in the boot loop. This results in allowing the device to be applied to a memory having a larger capacity, and allows a higher produc tion yield, and a high speed detection time for faulty loop data.
