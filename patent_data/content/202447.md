Said subject data stored are then compared with said programmed data for quality acceptance judgement. In the prior art, the base data and program preparations require not only a long period of time but skilled engineers, resulting in large expenses and possible delay in the manufacturing schedule. Another drawback of the prior art is that there are cases that the subject PC board whose quality has been accepted at the simulation test does not function accepted in an actual device. It necesitates not only reworking of itself but correction of the program, which results in further delay in the manufacturing schedule and additional expenses. The cost of the function tester of the prior art comes out very expensive as it requires a large capacity computer and a large sized probing device, and its use also comes out expensive because of the reason described above.Summary of the Invention In accordance with this invention, the function testing system and its use is provided to carry out the function test without the program to simulate the actual operation using the dummy, resulting in elimination of the work by the skilled engineers and requirement of no large capacity computer and bulky detecting device, thus lowering the cost of the system. It is, accordingly, an object of this invention to provice a system, wherein the base signal previously obtained from the PC board base PC board connected to the device in acutal operation, and a signal of the subject PC board connected to the active device in operation are compared in aCPU Central Processing Unit for judgement of quality acceptability of said subject PC board.

In said system 10, a keyboard 11 with a plurality of keys lla is connected to a CPU Central Processing Unit 12, and measuring conditions, setting and operating commands entered through said keyboard lia. Coordinate signal detecting means 13, which comprises a coordinate board 13a of matrix sensor and cursor 13b, is connected to said CPU 12. A bear board 14 with the test points indicated or a test point instruction sheet is set in advance in position on said coordinate board 13a.A plurality of the test points on the bear board is plotted by the cursor 13b to determine coordinates and sequence number, which are then stored in a magnetic hard disk or a floppy disk 15 in said CPU 12. Said cursor 13b has a transparent plate with an aim point 13c at its center and coils surrounding it. A switch 13d is turned on to release magnetic beam along the center axis of the aim point 13c when it is correctly aligned with a test point, through which the beam hits a point on the bear board 14, where the coordinates of the test point are determined.The correct X Y coordinates are automatically calculated and stored together with the plotting sequence numbers by said CPU 12 when two basic points of the bear board 14, X Y zero point at the left bottom corner 14a and the other point at the right bottom corner of the bear board 14, are initially defined, so that positioning alignment of the bear board 14 is not much critical. The coordinates stored by said CPU 12 can be transferred to a floppy disk or monitored on CRT 16. The coordinate signal stored by said CPU 12 is fed to a waveform detecting means 18 which is connected to said CPU 12 through extention bus unit 17. The wave for detecting means is driven successively, test point after test point, by commanding input from the CPU by entry through keys Ila. Said waveform detecting means comprises X Y Z drivers l8a, and a X Y Z table 18b. A normally functioning PC board basePC board 20 is set in a positioning frame 18d in a top plate 18c of the X Y Z table 18b, and is connected to an active device in operation 19. Said X Y Z table 18b in the shape of a. housing has at its bottom guide plates 18e, on which an axis beam 18f is arranged in orientation of Y axis and is driven along X axis by X axis driving motor l8g. A sliding member driven slong said axis beam 18f by Y axis driving motor 18h mounts a probe 18i which is allowed to move vertically in Z axis direction . Said probe 18i is raised through linkage mechanism 18k by driving means like a solenoid or a driving motor 18j, thus three dimensional tracking mechanism is formed. Said base PC board is moved from the normally functioning device 19, is placed on the X Y Z table 18b and is connected with said device 19 by cable l9a with connectors l9b and 19e at its both ends. The base board 10 is put into normal operation by said device 19 while the X Y Z drivers 18a are activated by output signal of coordinates from the CPU commanded through the keyboard and the probe is guided to a coordinate point corresponding to the test point indicated in the bear board by the X and Y driving motors 18g and 18h, and the probe is then raised by the Y axis driving motor 18j. The probe keeps tracking the test points of the PC board according to the indications in the bear board 14 until the normally functioning analogue signal is obtained at all the predetermined test points. The aforementioned mechanical structure to drive the probe 18i by the coordinate signal on the X Y Z table 18i is well known art, and its specific mechanism is not limited to the aforementioned embodiment. Said waveform pick up means is connected to waveform converting and memorizing means 23 which comprises a preconditioner 21 and a transient memory 22, which is a brand name of a device manufactured by Kawasaki Electronica and which is, as is used in this description and in the appended claim, a generally called digital memory. Said pre conditioner 21 is for processing input analogue signal so as for the transient memory 22 preferable to process before CPU processing. The pre conditioner 21 and the transient memory 22 can be constructed in one unit. Said pre conditioner 21 comprises an AC DC selector 21b, an attenuator 21c, and an amplifier 21dl all of which are connected in the order described, which is shown in Fig. 2 and connected to theCPU 12 through a control circuit 21a, and receive waveform processing instruction signal by operation of the keys lla.Analogue signal received by said waveform detecting means 18 goes through the waveform converting and memorizing means to CRT 16 to be first displayed, so that AC DC selection, adjustment of the attenuator 21c for voltage level and compensation of offset level by the amplifier 21d are made by observing the display. The processed analogue signal delivered from said amplifier 21d is fed to an A D Analogue to Digital converter of the transient memory 22, and at the same time is sent through a branch line to a trigger pluse generator 22e.Said trigger pulse generator 22e is connected with a sampling clock circuit 22g, which is linked with both said A D converter 22a and IC memory are connected each other. Meanwhile, said sampling clock circuit 22g and the rigger pulse generator 22e are connected through a control circuit 22d to CPU 12. When analogue signal is fed to said A D converter 22a, condition commanding signal with coordinate address numbers assigned is delivered to the trigger generator 22e from CPU by commanding through the keys lla. The instructions from the trigger generator 22e regarding triggering position and timing for said analogue waveform are given to the A D converter by way of the sampling clock circuit. The triggering instructions include trigger level, triggering time, and selection of triggering slope, rising slope or falling slope .The analogue waveform is digitized from the triggered point and the digitized signal is stored by IC memory 22b. Sampling time set for the A D converter 22a is entered through the keys Ila to CPU, and is executed through said sampling clock circuit 22g to instruct said A D converter. The sample ing time is a duration of time for digital memory, and the sampling time of this embodiment is a range of from BOnsec. through 50sec., duration adjustable within the range. The memory is started from the time of trigger pulse generated by the trigger pulse generator for a period of time set in advance, and the digital signal is stored in IC memory 22b.Both the A D converter and the IC memory are synchronized with the same sampling clock circuit 22g for correctly timed memory. Said IC memory 22b works as a buffer to store said digitized signal, and it transfers its memory contents toRAM 1 of CPU 12 through the extension bus unit 17 when predetermined amount of memory is filled the memory is saidRAM 1 is also transferred if necessary to a magnetic hard disk or a floppy disk 15a. A D A Digital to Analogue converter 22f is connected to the outlet of said IC memory 22b. The base data in the form of analogue waveform converted by said D A converter 22f is delivered through CPU to CRT 16 for monitor display. Án operator visually refers to the monitored display to enter through keys lla condition of command signals for said waveform converting and memorizing means 23. The condition of command is AC DC selection, voltage level adjustment, offset compensation, trigger starting timing, and sampling time, which are selectively set by the operator. When the base data in the RAM 1 of CPU 12 is read out to be entered to a comparator in the CPU, limits of a quality acceptance level range, extent of which depend on the function represented at the test point of the base PC board, are given by command through keys lla. The upper and lower limits forming the level range of said PC board are written into the magnetic hard disk as the test base data. The test base data can be stored in a floppy disk, and can be displayed on CRT 16 in analogue waveform through the D A converter connected to the comparator. In aforementioned description of the elements of this invention, accompanied description of procedures of measurement, recording and display are for a single test point. N times of the procesures, therefore, have to be repeated to measure and record n pieces of the test points according to the sequence address numbers of the coordinate signal. Composing for detection, treatment of the detected data, and its display of performance function of a subject PC board 20a are described below The base PC board 20 is removed and in its place the subject PC board 20a is positioned to be connected by the cable 19a with the active device 19. The test base data is transferred to the RAM 1 of CPU from the magnetic hard disk or a floppy disk, and then an address number of coded coordinate signal for a test point usually the first test point is entered through keys gila. The probe 18i is driven to the corresponding test point indicated by said address number by the keyed in command, and analogue waveform is obtained in the same manner as the case of the base data. The analogue signal from the waveform detecting means 18 goes through the waveform converting and memorizing means 23 and is transformed into digital signal, which is supplied to RAM 2 of the CPU 12 for storage as a subject data. The RAM 1 and the RAM 2 are connected to the comparator of said CPU 12, and the subject data is compared with the test base data in the comparator. The results of the comparison are printed out by a printer 24 in the character and the real number. Visual comparison between both the data is also possible by the display on CRT 16, which is connected to the comparator by way of the D A converter.An example of the visual comparison is shown in Fig. 3, in which both the base data and the subject data are in sine wave. In Fig. 3, Y asix stands for voltage level and X for time, the respective dotted lines 25 and 26 are the upper and lower limits added to the base data, and the solid line 27 is the subject data. In case of this example, the subject PC board is rejected as its waveform is not within the quality acceptance range. The preferred embodiment of this invention is illustrated in Flowcharts 4 and 5 in which 1 Step 1 of Fig. 4 The bear board 14 is positioned on the coordinate plate 13a of said digitizer 13. Initially the cardinal points of X Y coordinates at both the lower end corners of the bear board 14 are defined by locating the cursor 13b on them and pressing the switch No. 1, and then the coordinates Xi, Yi of each test point ill, 2, 3, ...n are determined pressing the switch No. 2 at each point. Step 2 of Fig. 4 The coordinates are coded in the sequential order of the address number and stored in the magnetic hard disk of the CPU or in the floppy disk. 2 Step 3 of Fig. 4 Then the base PC board 20 is placed in position on the X Y Z table 18b of the waveform detecting means 18, and is connected to the device 19 in operation for actual functioning. And then the commanding signal of the first address number of the coded coordinates from the floppy disk l5a is fed to the waveform detecting means 18 through the CPU 12 to move the probe 18i for contacting with the test point N1. Step 4 of Fig. 4 Then analogue signal is obtained from the test point N1 by the contact of the probe 18i. Step 5 of Fig. 4 The signal is sent to the transient memory 22 through the preconditioner 21, and is transformed into digital signal which is branched and led to the D A converter 22f for display monitoring on CRT 16. As information on the shape and characteristics of the waveform is provided by the display, selection of AC DC in the preconditioner 21 and offset level compensation are carried out by command through keys lia. Step 6 of Fig. 4 A part of the digital signal in the transient memory 22 is temporarily stored in the IC memory 22 by the triggering and sampling time instructions commanded through the keys lla. Step 7 of Fig, 4 The processed and stored signal at the step 6 is then transferred to the RAM 1 of CPU 12 for storage as the base data, and then the quality acceptance level range having upper and lower limits is added to it to be made into a test base data and is stored in the magnetic hard disk or a floppy disk 15. 3 Step 8 of Fig. 4 When all the procedures as described, above are finished for the test point N1, the same steps from 4 through 7 are takeh for the second test point N2, and go on to repeat the same procedures for all the remaining test points from N3 to Nn. Step 9 of Fig. 4 If all the test points are not measured, NO warning appears on the CRT display demanding to resume from the step 4, When all the test points have been checked, nYES n display comes on CRT, and model number of the base PC board, its manufacturing number, coded address numbers of test points Ni, test base data upper and lower level limits , and test condition settings voltage level of analogue waveform AC DC selector position, and sampling time are automatically written in the floppy disk. 4 Measuring operation of the subject PC board 20a is described below Step 10 of Fig. 5 The test base data is read out of the floppy disk and is moved to the RAM 1. Step 11 of Fig. 5 Then the subject PC board is positioned on the X Y Z table 18b and connected to the device 19 in operation for actual functioning. Step 12 of Fig. 5 Then command is keyed in through the keys ila so that instructions from the CPU move the probe to the coordinate point of the test point N1, which is the identical location with the first test point of said subjectPC board, and the probe is contacted with the test point. Step 13 of Fig. 6 At the same time, the preconditioner 21 and the transient memory 22 receive from the CPU the same instructions as those applied for the base PC board.Then the waveform detecting means 18 obtain analogue signal at the first test point. Step 14 of Fig. 5 The analogue signal obtained goes through the preconditioner to the transient memory 22, and then to the IC memory for storage as a digital subject data. Step 15 of Fig. 5 The subject data is then coded and stored in the RAM 2 of the CPU 12. Steps 16, 17 of Fig. 5 When the test operation at the test point NI of said subject PC board is finished, the same test procedures are taken for the next test point N2, then the same precedures are repeated for all the remaining test points Ni if3, 4, 5, ...n . Step 18 of Fig. 5 The test base data and the subject data are read out of the RAM 1 and RAM 2 respectively by the commanding operation of the keys lla entering the code number of the coordinate signal, and are applied to the comparator of the CPU. Then the subject data of a test point is checked in the comparator if it is within the range of the test base data of the corresponding test point. Step 19 of Fig. 5 Then the quality acceptance of the subject PC board is decided by the comparison results. Step 20 of Fig, 5 The test results of acceptance or rejection for the subject PC board are printed out by the printer 24 connected to the comparator. The e printout indicates type of the subject PC board,PC board number, coded test point number, upper and lower limits of the test base data range at each test point, data in real number of the subject PC board at each test point, and judgement of acceptance or rejection in character.Analogue waveform of any test point marked Rejection can be displayed on CRT 16 together with the analogue test base data. This visual observation of the defected point helps give specific comments when sending back the PC board for repair or reworking. The CRT display of the waveform comparison can also be utilized for immediate correction or adjustment by adjusting potentiometers on the PC board.
