# Method for making isolation trenches.

## Abstract
A method for making recessed oxide isolation trenches extending with different depth or width into a silicon semiconductor substrate. The substrate is reactively ion etched through mask apertures defining the deep trench areas and at least the perimeters of the shallow trench areas fig. 1 . The etched trenches 18, 19, 20 are oxidized and partially filled with chemical vapor deposited CVD oxide 21 . The filling of the trenches is completed with polycrystalline silicon 27 in fig. 2 . The excess polycrystalline silicon covering substrate areas other than the deep trench areas is removed down to the underlying CVD oxide. The shallow trench areas e.g. at 22, 23 in fig. 4 are etched next, some of the shallow trench areas connecting with the upper regions of the deep trench areas. The monocrystalline and polycrystalline silicon in the respective shallow trench areas are removed and the remaining silicon is thermally oxidized.
