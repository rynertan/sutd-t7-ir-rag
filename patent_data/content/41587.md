## Description
Title Catalyst compositions, production thereof, and use in production of oxygenated organic compounds. This invention relates to new catalyst compositions, to the production thereof and their use in the production of oxygenated organic compounds. There are several known methods for producing oxygenated organic compounds. The acid catalyzed H2S04, HBF4 etc. synthesis of carboxylic acids or esters by the reaction of an olefinic substrate with CO and water or alcohol has been known since 1931. J. Falbe, carbon Monoxide in OrganicSynthesis , Springer Verlag, New York 1970 .Although this process was used on a commercial scale it does have serious limitations due to the reaction conditions and the isomeric composition of the products. A more commercially important synthesis of carboxylic acid esters is the direct carbonylat ion of olefinic substrates with CO and water alcohol conducted in the presence of transition metals. In general, this carbonylation reaction, discovered by Repp in 1940 I. Wender and P. Pino, Organic Synthesis Via Metal Carbonyls , Volume 2,John Wiley, New York 1977 , involves the addition of carbon monoxide, carboxyl alkyl or amide group Y H where Y equals OR or NHR and R is an alkyl , and an olefin. However, when an unsymmetrical olefin is used as the substrate at least two isomeric products are obtained. No general method has been developed for the control of the isomeric product composition. The present invention overcomes some of these problems present in the prior art.For example, the invention process results in higher conversions, higher yields and faster reaction rates than those disclosed in the prior art. Furthermore, the instant process allows one to obtain a high yield of a particular isomeric product composition.Thus, extremely high selectivities of particular oxygenated organic compounds can be obtained. by the process of the invention. Finally, the prior art carbonylation reactions operate under extreme conditions of temperature. and pressure. In general, temperatures in the range of 1600C to 30000 and pressures in the range of 1,500 to 5,000 psi 105 350 kg cm2 are required. On the other hand, the process according to the invention may be carried out under relatively mild conditionslaof temperature and pressure. This further advantage can result in substantial cost sayings in the production of oxy genated organic compounds. It has now been discovered that oxygenated organic compounds canbe produced by contacting an olefinically unsaturated compound with carbon monoxide and a compound containing a replaceable hydrogen atom in the presence of a new catalyst comprising cobalt and or ruthenium carbonyl and a promotor ligand selected from the group consisting of heterocyclic nitrogen compounds and phosphorus or sulphur oxides. In particular, the process of the invention results in high yields of oxygenated organic compounds when operating at much lower temperatures and pressures than disclosed in the prior art. In addition, the product distribution can be varied significantly by changing the 00 112 ratio, pressure, ligand, solvent, reaction time and other process variables. Thus, the present invention provides a new catalyst which comprises a promoter ligand and at least one of cobalt and ruthenium carbonyl. In addition the invention provides a novel process for the production of an oxygenated organic compound comprising contacting an olefinically unsaturated compound with carbon monoxide and a compound containing a replaceable hydrogen atom in the presence of the new catalyst. The present invention also provides a novel process for the production of an oxygenated organic compound comprising contacting an olefinically unsaturated compound containing an alcohol moiety with carbon monoxide in the presence of the new catalyst. In a specific example of the invention the carbonylation reaction ot acrylonitrile, carbon monoxide, hydrogen gas, and methanol to yield methyl ss cyanopro pionate proceeds smoothly using a catalyst comprising cobalt carbonyl and a hLeterocyclic nitrogen oxide promoter ligand. According to the present invention, improved yields and selectivities otf oxygenated organic compounds are obtained by contacting an olefinically unsaturated compound with carbon monoxide and a compound containing a replaceable hydrogen atom over a catalyst comprising cobalt and or ruthenium carbonyl and a promoter ligand selected from heterocyclit nitrogen compounds and phosphorus or sulphur pxides. The overall reaction taking place in this process is represented by the followingEMI4.1 R1, R2 and Y are defined below.Reactants Olefinically unsaturated compounds which can be employed as reactants in the process of the invention have the following structur,e R11CH CHR12 wherein R11 and R12 are each independently selected from 1 hydrogen either R11 or R12 but not both 2 91 30 alkyl 3 CH2 p CN, wherein p is 0 3 and 4 CH2 q OR13, wherein q is 1 30 and R13 is hydrogen or methyl. Preferably, the olefinically unsaturated compounds comprise compounds wherein R11 and R12 are each independently 1 hydrogen. either R11 or R12 but not both 2 C1 10 alkyl 3 ch2 p CN, wherein.pis 0 2 and 4 CH2 q OH, wherein q is 1 10. Most preferably, the olefinically unsaturated compounds comprise compounds wherein R1 and R2 are. each independently selected from hydrogen either R1 or R2 but not both , methyl and CH2 p CN, wherein p is 0 1. The second component in the inventive reaction system is a compound containing a replaceable hydrogen atom. This compound can be represented by the following formula H Y wherein Y is selected from 1 OR14 wherein R14 is a C1 30 alkyl EMI5.1 wherein R15 and R16 are each independently selected from C1 10 alkyls and 3 H.Preferably Y is selected from 1 OR14 wherein R14 is a C1 10 alkyl 2 wherein R15 and R16 are each indepenEMI5.2 dently selected from C1 3 H.More preferably Y is selected from. 1 OR wherein 1114 is a C1 4 alkyl and 2 H.The second component is most preferably either methanol or hydrogen. In the embodiment of the invention in which H Y is an alcohol or amine, it is preferred to add hydrogen gas to the reaction system. Preferably the amount of hydrogen gas so added comprises less than 10 by volume of the total amount of the hydrogen gas and carbon monoxide gas in the reaction system. More preferably the hydrogen gas comprises 0.5 to 7.5k by volume of the hydrogen and carbon monoxide gas. The addition of hydrogen gas can increase both the yield and selectivity to desired products in this mode of the invention. When H2 is the compound containing a replaceable hydrogen atom then the reaction system will preferably contain 10 to 60 by volume hydrogen gas based on the total volume of the carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas. More preferably the reaction system will contain about 50 hydrogen gas. One way to supply carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas into the reaction system is in the form of synthesis gas. The amount of hydrogen in the synthesis gas can be easily adjusted prior to insertion into the reactor. The amount of carbon monoxide in the reaction system is not critical. Preferably the carbon monoxide is present in at least stoichiometric amounts and most preferably the carbon monoxide is present in amounts greatly in excess of stoichiometric amounts. If desired, a carrier gas which is inert to the reactants, products and catalyst can be included inthe reaction system. The molar ratio of the compound containing a replaceable hydrogen atom to the olefinically unsaturated compound can be 0.5 100 1 with a ratio of 1 10 1 being preferred. This ratio does not include the hydrogen gas which may be added to the reaction system when H Y is an alcohol or amino. In the embodiment of the invention in which the olefin reactant is an alcohol i.e. wherein R1 or R2 is cH2 OH , it has been found that the terminal hydrogen atom on the alcohol group will itself serveas a replaceable hydrogen atom. As a result, the alcohol moiety of the olefin will react with the olefinic double bond of the olefin thereby producing a lactone. In this reaction system no H Y component need by included since the olefin itself acts both as the olefin and the H Y component. The reaction in this particular system its shown by the following equation EMI7.1 Lactone wherein at least one of R1 and R2 is an alochol .Process Conditions Generally, in carrying out the process of the invention, the olefinically unsaturated compound, carbon monoxide and the compound containing a replaceable hydrogen atom are contacted with one another in the liquid phase in the presence of the catalyst deschibed below. The reaction can be accomplished in the batch mode or continuously. The reaction temperature is normally maintained between 500C to 1500C. and most preferably at about 1000C. The reaction pressure is normally maintained at 7 to 175 kg cm2 100 to 2500 psi preferably at 49 to 70 kg cm2 700 to 1000 psi . When the reaction is carried out in a batch mode, the reactants and catalyst are contacted with one another for a period of ten minutes through six hours, and preferably one half hour to four hours.A reaction time of less than ten minutes or more than six hours can be used. if desired although better results will be obtained if the reaction time is maintained within this range. When the process is carried out on a continuous basis, the reaction catalyst contact time is normally 10 seconds to 10 minutes, preferably l0.0 seconds to 5 minutes. Both the rate of reaction and product distribution can be varied significantly by changing the process parameters. For example, normally an increase in pressure increases.1the rate of reaction. However, at very high pressures the reaction rate may decrease due to catalyst decomposition. Furthermore, the selectivity to a particular product may be affected by pressure changes, e.g.in the carbonylation of acrylonitrile there is an increase in the selectivity to the n cyanoester 3CE as the pressure decreases. A balance exists between temperatures and pressure with respect to catalyst decomposition. Generally, as the temperature increases the rate of reaction increases. However, an anomolous effect may occur due to partial catalyst decomposition. Thus, the tempera ture and pressure must bye carefully adjusted. Similarly, residence time has a large effect on homogeneous process. For example, in the process for the carbonylation of acrylonitrile, the selectivity to methyl 0 cyanopropionate is much higher at short reaction times. Applicants surmise that the reduction in selectivity as a function of reaction time is caused by the reduction of the ligand, e.g. 4 picoline N oxide is reduced to 4 picoline.. In view of the above discussion, it is clear that a particular reaction rate and product.distribution can be obtained by a careful adjustment of the process variables.Catalysts The catalyst employed in the inventive process can be generally described as one of two types. Both types comprise cobalt and or ruthenium carbonyl and a promoter ligand in an organic solvent. The promoter ligand is either a heterocyclic nitrogen compound or a phosphorus or sulphur oxide. The nitrogen heterocyclic promoter ligand has the following structure EMI9.1 wherein X is one of N and NO and wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5 are each independently selected from 1 H 2 Cl l0 alkyls 3 CH2 qOH wherein q is 0 10 EMI9.2 wherein s is 0 10 and 5 O CH2 tCH3 wherein t is 0 10 wherein R1 and R2 may comprise a five to eight membered carbocyclic fused ring optionally substituted with C1 10 alktyls. Preferably, X is NO, and R,, R2, Rx, R, and R5 are selected from H, C14 alkyls, CH2OH, OH,EMI9.3 and OCH3. Most preferably, R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 are selected from H, CH3, and OCH3. The phosphorus or sulphur oxide promoter ligands having the following formulae EMI10.1 wherein 116, RV R8, R9, and R10 are each independently selected from 1 C1 10 alkyls 2 polynuclear aryls containing up to 12 carbon atoms, optionally substituted with C1 10 alkyls and 3 o CH2 tCH3, wherein t is 0 10 and wherein n is 0 or 1. Preferably, RÃ§, R7, R8, H9, and RIO are each independently selected from C1 4 alkyls and most preferably R6, R7, R8, R9, and R10 are CH3. Th e catalyst according to the invention can be prepared by mixing the cobalt and or ruthenium carbonyl with at least one promoter ligand in a solvent. The cobalt and or ruthenium carbonyl and the promoter ligand may be added simultaneously or separately to. the solvent. The exact relationship in the solvent between the cobalt and or ruthenium carbonyl and the promoter ligand is not known. Any solvent in which the catalyst is soluble may be used in the present invention. Preferably the solvent is an alcohol, aromatic, ester, nitrile and or dinitrile. The solvent is most preferably an alcohol or ester. In fact, the alcohol can be both a compound containing a replaceable hydrogen atom described above and the solvent. The preferred catalyst concentration in the solvent is normally between 0.1 to 5 by weight. The cobalt and or ruthenium carbonyl can be added to the solvent in any form from which cobalt andXor ruthenium carbonyl could be formed. For example, it is well known in the art that carbonyls can be formed from naphthalates, salts and nitrates and thus suitable naphthalates, salts and nitrates can be added to the solvent to form a carbonyl compound in situ. Preferably, the catalyst contains cobalt carbonyl. In general, the promoter ligand to cobalt and or ruthenium carbonyl molar ratio is 0.1 50 1, preferably about 0.5 4, and most preferably about 2 1. This ratio will vary depending on the promoter ligand chosen. At high ligand to carbonyl ratios i.e. 4 1 the rate of reaction substantially decreases even though selectivity to the desired product may be increased. Thus, in the.carbonylation of acrylonitrile, at high ligand carbonyl ratios the reaction rate decreases but the selectivity to methyl ss cyanopropionate increases. The catalyst of this invention is dissolved in the reaction medium as a homogeneous catalyst. These homogeneous catalysts are prepared by known techniques.Specific preparations of these catalysts are shown in the working examples of this specification. Broadly, however, the catalysts of this invention can be prepared by any of the techniques known in the art.Recovery The reaction product obtained upon completion of the reaction is normally in the form of a liquid and composed primarily of unreacted reactants, catalyst and oxygenated organic compounds. This reaction product can be subjected to suitable known separation techniques, ie. solvent extraction and fra.ctional distillation, to yield the desired end products. A particularly good method for separating the catalyst from the products obtained in the present process is by the use of conjugate phase extraction.In this separation scheme, the reaction effluent is 12 treated with a C5 to C8 hydrocarbon which is miscible with the reaction solvent but which is a very poor solvent for the catalyst. Examples of such hydrocarbons are pentane, hexane and octane. Enough of this hydrocarbon is added to the reactor effluent to separate almost all of the catalyst into one phase and a significant amount of products into the other phase.Generally, this is between 1 to 4 volumes of hydrocarbon per volume of reactor effluent. It is desirable to exclude oxygen from this separation system so. thatcatalyst decomposition will not occur. It is also desirable to minimize the amounts of unreacted substrates in the reactor effluent prior to treatment with theihydrocarbon. This can be accomplished by simpletdistillation or vacuum stripping.Finally,it is desirable to separate the products and reactants as quickly as possible to reduce the possibility of unwanted side reactions, e.g. methyl s cyanopripionate reacts with acrylonitrile to produce a dicyano ester. The catalyst containing hydrocarbon phase can be diluted and recycled back to the reactor. The product phase is then subjected to known separation techniques such as distillation or extraction. The oxygenated organic compounds produced by this process are useful. as precursors to polymers. The esters are also useful in perfumes, flavourings and pharmaceuticals. Thesaldehydes are useful as plasticizers and as intermediates for alcohols. In order more thoroughly to illustrate the present invention, the following examples are given.In these examples, the following definitions are used moles carbon in reactant ffi Conv converted to produced X 100 moles carbon in reactant fed moles carbon of olefinically unsatu Y eld rated compound converted to product X 100 moles moles carbon of olefinically unsatu rated compound fedThe results have allbeen adjusted to a 100 carbon balance.

Next, cobalt carbonyl, Co2 CO 8,is added and the autoclave sealed. The autoclave is flushed twice with synthesis gas and then charged with the synthesis gas to the desired pressure. The temperature is .then increased and the reaction proceeds for 1 to 4 hours. Occasionally, samples are withdrawn during the course of the reaction through the vent tube antd subjected to gas chromatography analysis.
