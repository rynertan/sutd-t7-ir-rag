# COATING COMPOSITION CAPABLE OF FORMING CERAMIC LIKE COATING AND METHOD OF PREPARING SUCH COATING COMPOSITION

## Abstract
The particular coating composition containing a cement, an ingredient A and an ingredient B which contains a rubber latex is disclosed. Ingredient A contains several ingredients which include 1 an aggregate forming powder, 2 a water soluble cellulose derivative, and 3 a metal salt of a higher fatty acid. When applied to a substrate, the coating composition provides a durable surface which has improved water proof properties, increased resistance to scratching or surface marring, and color fading. A method for preparing the above described coating composition is also disclosed. The coating composition of the invention may be applied to a substrate, such as by spraying to form a coating which, when set or hardened, provides a durable, ceramic like surface.
