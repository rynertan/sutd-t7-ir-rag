# Single inlet outlet tank U shaped tube heat exchanger.

## Abstract
A single inlet outlet tank U shaped tube heat exchanger is disclosed comprising a tank 10 having a header plate 22 and a plurality of U shaped tubes 14 whose legs 18A, 18B extend through and terminate with an open end 24A, 24B at one side of the header plate. A first group 26 of the tubes is arranged so that the two open ends of each of these tubes are located in one and the other of the two outboard rows 28, 30 extending longitudinally of the header plate. A second group 32 of the tubes with a smaller radius return bend 16 is arranged in staggered pairs intermediate those in the first group and with their return bends parallel to each other and angled to those in the first group so that one open leg end of each of the tubes in the second group is located in one and the other of the outboard rows and the remaining open leg of each of these tubes is located in a third and inboard row 34 extending between the two outboard rows. A partition 36 in the tank cooperates with the header plate to define an inlet chamber and an outlet chamber 44,46 in the tank open respectively to the open tube ends in one and the other of the two outboard rows and also to alternate ones of the open tube ends in the inboard row whereby each of the tubes is connected to effect two pass flow between said chambers.
