# Apparatus for applying a coating to a moving surface.

## Abstract
Apparatus for applying a coating to a surface of a moving workpiece comprises a coating dispenser 34 having at least one coating outlet 35 spaced apart from the workpiece surface for dispensing a stream of coating. A dispenser control unit 30 is operatively coupled with the dispenser 34 for initiating and terminating the dispensing of the stream of coating as predetermined parts of the workpiece surface come into alignment with the coating outlet. The invention provides an anti tailing device 43 coating with the stream of coating intermediate the outlet and the workpiece surface for substantially preventing tailing of the stream of coating following termination of dispensing thereof. The anti tailing structure 43 comprises an air nozzle 44 having an output 45 positioned for directing an air jet upon the stream of coating in a direction generally normal thereto. The air jet is provided for a short period on each termination of dispensing of the coating.
