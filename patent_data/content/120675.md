## Description
Nickel iron welding alloy The present invention relates to a nickel iron welding alloy for use as a welding wire in welding cast irons and other metal alloys, in particular nickel iron alloys. Manufacturers of welding products have for many years tried to develop a welding wire specifically intended for welding cast iron. By welding wire as used herein is meant an alloy in wire or strip form which may be used as a core for coated electrodes, a strip from which a sheath for cored electrodes is produced, strip for submerged arc welding SAW or wire for gas metal arc welding GMAW or MIG or for gas tungsten arc welding GNAW or TIG . Such wires may be for use in single or multipass welding techniques.In the welding of cast iron, the welding wire must have good mechanical properties, must tolerate dilution, be applicable to GTAIV TIG , GMAW MIG pulsed arc welding, spray welding and SAW processes, be crack resistant and exhibit good wetting characteristics.It must also lend itself to the production of electrodes for semi automatic and fully automatic robotics. Amongst many earlier attempts to develop welding alloys and welding products for welding cast iron and nickel iron based alloys the following are of note UK patent 995 069 relating to a nickel iron welding material having a low coefficient of expansion UK patent 1 154 269 relating to a nickel iron welding alloy having a flux coating intended for welding austenitic ductile iron US patent 3 644 144 relating to a coated nickel iron welding electrode and UK patents 1 397 685 and 1 494 489 relating to flux cored welding electrodes for welding cast iron. The latter patents cover electrodes which have become commercially available asNI ROD 55 NI ROD is a Trade Mark of the Inco group of companies and use as the sheath material a 55 45 nickel iron alloy.This material however is crack sensitive and cannot be used in situations where strength is critical. The present invention is based on the development of a nickel iron alloy for use as welding wire, as hereinbefore defined, which gives sound weld deposits when used in the welding of cast iron and nickel iron alloys. According to the present invention there is provided a welding wire for use in welding cast iron or nickel iron alloys consisting of up to 0.38 carbon, 4.9 to 15 manganese, 36 to 60 nickel, up to 1 silicon, up to 4 copper, the balance apart from impurities being iron in the range 36 to 60 . Preferably the welding wire has a composition in the range 0.1 to 0.3 carbon, 7 to 12 manganese, up to 0.2 silicon, 41 to 44 nickel, the balance apart from impurities being iron.A particularly useful welding wire has the nominal composition 0.3 carbon, 11.4 manganese, 0.118 silicon, 41.2 nickel balance iron.

Firstly the surfaces of ductile iron plates were ground. Beads were made on the ductile iron plate using the GMAW process. It was noted that beads made with the wires of the invention exhibited less surface oxide and flowed better than those made from the Ni Fe alloy A.In a second series of tests carbon dioxide and argon were used to evaluate the butt welding of ductile iron. The resulting welds were compared to those from alloys A and B. Using liquid penetrant techniques it was determined that alloy A cracked and alloy B exhibited a few cracks.Alloys of the invention displayed good cracking resistance. Results are given in Tables II. Welding tests were also carried out to compare performance in butt welding ductile iron to itself and to a steel.Results are given in Table III.

A series of welded joints were made using the above wires as welding material using a ductile iron workpiece in the shape of a plate. Using liquid penetrated techniques it was discovered that welding wire 7, the only wire falling within the invention, having the highest manganese content had very little cracking in the weld material whereas the other welds had significant cracks. Welding wires of the present invention will be seen from Example l to give good welding results with a minimum of cracking. The wires of the invention have economic advantages over prior art welding wires for use in the welding of ductile iron, for example they contain far less nickel.
