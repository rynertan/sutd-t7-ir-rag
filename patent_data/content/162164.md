# MAGNET STRUCTURE

## Abstract
Permanent magnets 12 are used to perform useful work. The field of a first permanent magnet 12 is diverted by electromagnetic coils 22, 24 to such a low value that another opposing permanent magnet 20, 26, 52 can ap proach the first magnet 12 without the application of undue force. The field in the first magnet 12 is restored to act on the second magnet so as to repel it. The force which results may be harnessed to effect reciprocal or rotary motion.
