For example, the compounds of formula I wherein Q is a radical of formula a , said compounds being represented by the formula I a , can be prepared by cyclizing an appropriate 2 amino benzamide or 2 aminobenzenethioamide of formula IV a with urea or thiourea. The compounds of formula I a can also be prepared by cyclizing an appropriate intermediate of formula IV b with an amine of formula V or by cyclizing an isocyanate or isothiocyanate of formula IV c with a primary amine of formula V . The said cyclization reactions are conveniently conducted by stirring and, if desired, heating the reactants together, optionally in a suitable reaction inert solvent having a relatively high boiling point such as aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g. petroleum ether, dimethylbenzene.

For example, the compounds of formula I a wherein R³ is amino, may be derived from the corresponding nitro substituted quinazolines following art known nitro to amine reduction procedures. A suitable nitro to amine reducing procedure is, for example, catalytic hydrogenation in a relatively polar solvent such as, for example, an alcohol, e.g. methanol or ethanol, in the presence of an appropriate catalyst, e.g. platinum on charcoal. In some cases it may be useful to add an appropriate catalyst poison, e.g. thiophene. The compounds of formula I a wherein R³ is phenylmethoxy may be converted into compounds of formula I a wherein R³ is hydroxy following art known catalytic hydrogenolysis procedures the compounds of formula I a wherein R³ is amino or hydroxy may be converted into compounds of formula I a wherein R³ is C₁ ₁₀ alkylcarbonyl amino or C₁ ₁₀ alkylcarbonyl oxy respectively by reacting the former compounds with a suitable acylating agent, e.g. an acylhalide or an acid anhydride the compounds of formula I a wherein R³ is an amino group may be converted into compounds of formula I a wherein R³ is an azido group by converting the amino group into a diazonium group with nitrous acid or an appropriate alkali metal or earth alkaline metal thereof and subsequently converting the said diazonium group into an azide group with sodium azide or any other suitable alkali metal or earth alkaline metal azide. The compounds of formula I have basic properties and, consequently, they may be converted to their therapeutically active non toxic acid addition salt forms by treatment with appropriate acids, such as, for example, inorganic acids, such as hydrohalic acid, e.g. hydrochloric, hydrobromic and the like, and sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid and the like or organic acids, such as, for example, acetic, propanoic, hydroxyacetic, 2 hydroxypropanoic, 2 oxopropanoic, ethanedioic, propanedioic, butanedioic, Z 2 butenedioic, E 2 butenedioic, 2 hydroxybutanedioic, 2,3 dihydroxybutanedioic, 2 hydroxy 1,2,3 propanetricarboxylic, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, 4 methylbenzenesulfonic, cyclohexanesulfamic, 2 hydroxybenzoic, 4 amino 2 hydroxybenzoic. Conversely the salt form can be converted by treatment with alkali into the free base form. A number of intermediates and starting materials in the foregoing preparations are known compounds which may be prepared according to art known methodologies of preparing said or similar compounds. For example, the intermediates of formula II and their preparations are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,335,127 4,342,870 4,443,451 and 4,485,107.

The compounds of formula I and the pharmaceutical acceptable acid addition salts thereof are potent antagonists of a series of neurotransmittors and as a result they have useful pharmacological properties. For example, the compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts possess strong psychotic activity and antiserotonine activity. Due to their pharmacological activities the compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts can be used in the treatment of psychotic diseases and in the treatment of a variety of complaints in which serotonin release is of predominant importance such as, for example, in the blocking of serotonin induced contractions of bronchial tissues and of blood vessels, arteries as well as veins. The subject compounds have also useful properties as sedating , anxiolytic , anti agressive , anti stress , muscular protectant and cardiovascular protectant agents and, consequently, they are useful to protect warm blooded animals, for example, in stress situations, e.g., during transport periods. Additionally, the subject compounds are useful as protectors of endotoxine shocks and as antidiarrhoeals. In view of their useful pharmacological properties, the subject compounds may be formulated into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, an effective amount of the particular compound, in base or acid addition salt form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirably in unitary dosage form suitable, preferably, for administration orally, rectally, percutaneously, or by parenteral injection. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs and solutions or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents in the case of powders, pills, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, to aid solubility, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents may be employed. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and or a suitable wettable agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not introduce a significant deletorious effect on the skin. Said additives may facilitate the administration to the skin and or may be helpful for preparing the desired compositions. These compositions may be administered in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch, as a spot on, as an ointment. Acid addition salts of I due to their increased water solubility over the corresponding base form, are obviously more suitable in the preparation of aqueous compositions. It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used in the specification and claims herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such dosage unit forms are tablets including scored or coated tablets , capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, injectable solutions or suspensions, teaspoonfuls, tablespoon fuls, and segregated multiples thereof.
