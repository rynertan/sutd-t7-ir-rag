# Water separator for a gas analyser.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a water separator 1 for a gas analyser with a water separation chamber formed in a housing 2 , a supply 9 and a discharge 10 for the gas to be analysed being connected with said chamber and a collection reservoir 17 for the separated water being positioned below said water separation chamber. The water separation chamber consists of a conical and annular space 8 having a diameter that decreases towards the collection reservoir and wherein the supply 9 and the discharge 10 debouch in that part of the an nular space having substantially the greatest diameter. This results in a very effective separation of the water and the gas. A water lock 5 can be provided between the annular space 8 and the collection reservoir 17 , said water lock limiting the dead space. The water separator can further be improved by cooling at least one wall of the annular space.
