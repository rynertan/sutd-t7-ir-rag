# APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR EXTRUDING POLYMER MELTS

## Abstract
This invention relates to an apparatus and a method for extruding polymer melts, especially to produce blown films of reduced surface damage caused by melt fracture. The apparatus is an extrusion die which has a means for heating the die lips provided on or embedded into the face thereof. The extrusion die of this invention may be used for extrusion of melts of polyolefins, polyesters, polystyrene, polyamides, polyvinyl chloride and polyvinylidene chloride.
