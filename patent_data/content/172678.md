# Method for producing a liquid silicone rubber base.

## Abstract
Filled silicone rubber bases can be prepared without plasticizer by passing all of the filler together with from 30 to 100 percent of the total weight of the polyorganosiloxane ingredient of the base through the first kneading section of a compounding extruder and adding any remaining polyorga nosiloxane before passing the composition through a second kneading section of the compounding extruder. The two kneading sections are maintained at temperatures of from 200 to 300 C.
