## Description
SOLDERING TOOL BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates generally to soldering tools and particularly relates to such a temperature controlled tool which is widely adaptable to different purposes. One of the problems with prior art soldering tools featuring an electronic temperature control is that the heating element frequently generates heat which radiates or which is conducted back through the handle which must be held by the operator. This is particularly troublesome when the instrument is utilized for long production runs, so that it becomes hard for the operator to hold the hot handle Another problem with prior art temperaturecontrolled soldering instruments is that they usually require a copper soldering tip and shank. Copper has a great advantage in that it readily conducts heat and thus transfers heat from the heating element rapidly to the tip. The disadvantage of a copper tip is that it wears out fast and it may corrode due to the solder and the flux. Hence, it would be desirable to be able to utilize iron for the tip.Such a tip is long lasting.On the other hand, it produces little heat transfer between the heater and the iron tip. In order to be able to use an iron tip, the heater must be able to attain higher temperatures, so as to retain the tip at a desired temperature lower than that of the heater element.Hence, a combination of copper for good heat conductivity and an iron cladding or sleeve would be best to obtain a long lasting tip which has excellent heat transfer between the heating element and the tip. Furthermore, it will be apparent that good heat insulation between the handle and the heating element is essential for this type of operation. In addition, it may be necessary to plate a copper core with stainless steel, because this will prevent the flux from creeping up the shank of the tip. It is, accordingly, an object of the present invention to provide what may be called a general purpose soldering tool. A further object of the present invention is to provide such a temperature controlled tool which has very little heat transfer between the heating element and the handle. Another object of the present invention is to provide a tip which may be made out of copper or of iron and which may be clad, in the latter case, with various selected materials, while providing a copper core.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is a soldering tool comprising a generally cylindrical housing serving as a handle and having an electric cord receiving end of reduced diameter, a pair of internal, opposite projections disposed inside said housing for guiding a circuit board bearing an electronic temperature control circuit, a retainer sleeve, a heating element assembly in the form of a hollow tube disposed in said sleeve, a soldering tip having a shank, a threaded collar extending over said retainer sleeve and including means for removably securing it to said housing, and means on said soldering tip and shank, on the one hand, and on said retainer sleeve on the other hand, for retaining said soldering tip and shank in thermal contact with said heating element assembly. The connection between the housing forming the handle and the heater element which, in turn, heats the soldering tip, is preferably provided primarily by plastic materials which have a low heat transfer. This will maintain the handle at a temperature which feels cool to the hand of the operator. There may also be provided a strain relief element through which the electric cord is threaded to substantially prevent pulling of the cord through the instrument. The strain relief element furthermore may have two flat sides so that the element bears against the walls of the handle, thereby to index the circuit board. In embodiments of the invention, the other end of the circuit board bears against the heating element assembly, which prevents longitudinal movement thereof. The soldering tip and its shank may be secured in various ways. It may, for example, be held by a retainer sleeve which, in turn, is held in place by a threaded collar. Alternatively, the soldering tip and shank may be held in an adjustable position by a split collet. Various other ways are shown for holding or retaining the soldering tip and shank, such, for example, as a shoulder on the shank. Furthermore, the soldering tip and shank may consist of a copper core having a rearwardly extending stainless steel sleeve and a cladding of the tip proper consisting of low carbon iron. In case a collet is used for retaining the soldering tip and shank, it will permit adjustment of the distance between the heating element and the soldering tip, which, in turn, can be used to control the temperature. Additionally, it is feasible to redress the soldering tip, which may be of copper, by simply extending the shank further outwardly. Finally, it is possible with such a construction to provide a soldering tip and shank which is provided with a tip on both ends, so that by simply reversing the soldering tip it can be used for different purposes.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Embodiments of the present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is an

THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Referring now to the drawings and particularly to Figs. 1 to 9, there is illustrated a preferred embodiment of the general purpose soldering tool of the present invention. As shown particularly in Fig. 1, the tool includes a soldering tip 35 followed by a shank 36 which is preferably made integral to the tip 35. The soldering tip 35 is followed by a heating element assembly 37 which, in turn, is followed by a threaded collar 40 which has a circular rim 41 facing the tip 35. The threaded collar 40 has internal threads 42, as clearly shown in Fig. 3, which mesh with the external threads 43 of the handle or housing 44. The housing 44 is provided with a circular opening 45 which is normally covered by the threaded collar 40. However, as clearly shown in Fig. 2, the collar 40 with its outer rim 41 may be screwed toward the soldering tip 35, thereby to uncover the opening 45.Disposed within the opening 45 and on the circuit board 46 is a potentiometer 47 with a cross shaped depression 48 so that a screwdriver may be inserted into the depression 48 to adjust the temperature of the heating element forming part of the heating assembly. The housing or handle 44 extends rearwardly and forms a cord bushing 50 of reduced diameter. The electric cord 51 extends rearwardly of the bushing 50. It should be noted, for example from Fig. 3, that the circuit board is provided with various circuit components including amplifiers, etc. The rear portion of the circuit board 46 bears an anti twist pull cord bushing 53, the purpose of which is to prevent the cord being pulled out of the handle 44. As clearly shown inFigs. 4 and 5, the bushing is provided with two large circular openings 54 through which the cord 51 is threaded, as shown in Figs. 7 and 8. The cord bushing 53 is provided with opposite straight edges 55 which bear against the inner wall of the housing 44. This is particularly shown in Fig. 9. This, in turn, will prevent the cordbushing from rotating, and hence serves to index the circuit board 46. The circuit board, in turn, rests on two opposite projections or ledges 56.These two opposite projections 56 are clearly shown inFigs. 28 to 30. The cord bushing 53 may be provided with pegs 57, as clearly shown in Fig. 5, for securing it to appropriate apertures in the circuit board. Alternatively, it is feasible to mould the cord bushing 53 integral with the circuit board 46, as shown in Fig. 6. It should be noted that the heater assembly 37 may be provided with a heater bushing 58 provided with external threads 60 which may mesh, for example, with a retainer sleeve, to be discussed in connection with Figs.10 and 11. An alternate construction of the soldering tool of the present invention is illustrated in Figs. 10 and 11, to which reference is now made. The tool of Fig. 10 additionally features a retainer sleeve 62 having a reduced front portion 63, a ring 64, such as an O ring, a retainer bushing 65, the remaining parts being the same as described before. The assembled instrument is shown in Fig. 11. It will be noted that the soldering tip is provided with an enlarged external collar 69 which, in turn, is retained by the reduced front portion 63 of the retainer sleeve 62. The beating element assembly 37 is enclosed by the retainer sleeve 62. The retainer bushing 65, in turn, holds the external rearward collar 66 of the retainer sleeve 62, while the ring 64 bears against the internal shoulder 67 of the retainer bushing 65. Finally, the threaded collar 40 fits over the retainer bushing 65 and, again, has an external outwardly extending projection or rim 41. It will be noted that in the embodiment of Figs. 10 and 11 there is no need for any threaded connections between the retainer sleeve 62 and the retainer bushing 65, but only for the threaded collar 40 which screws on to the threads 43 of the housing 44 Fig. 3 . In some cases it may be desirable to increase the heat conduction between the heating assembly and the soldering tip. This may be accomplished, for example, by a heat accumulator disposed between the heating element and the shank of the soldering tip. Such an inner heat accumulator is shown in Figs. 12 and 13, which will now be discussed. As clearly shown in Figs. 12 and 13, the shank 36 of the heavy duty soldering tip 35 is hollow, as shown at 68. The front portion of the shank 36 is provided with an internal thread 70. This thread meshes with the external thread 71 of the inner heat accumulator 72. Otherwise, the construction is the same as that shown in Figs. 10 and 11. It will be evident that the inner heat accumulator 72 provides an additional path for the heat, and hence there is a better heat conduction between the heater and the soldering tip. Instead of utilizing an inner heat accumulator, it is also feasible to provide what may be called an outer heat accumulator which simultaneously serves as a tip retainer. Such a tip retainer is shown at 74 inFigs. 14 and 15. The accumulator tip retainer 74 is provided at its rearward end with an external collar 75 which, in turn, is held by a somewhat shorter retainer sleeve 62. The retainer sleeve 62 has an inwardly reduced portion 77 which engages the collar 75 and retains it. The remainder of the construction is the same as that previously described. In accordance with the present invention, it is feasible to utilize soldering tips and shanks consisting either of copper or of iron, or of a combination of the two. The advantages and disadvantages of copper and iron have already been pointed out. Basically, however, copper is a far better heat conductor but is subject to corrosion by the soldering flux and the heat.On the other hand, iron will withstand flux and other corrosive materials, as well as the high temperatures of the soldering process. However, the heat conduction of iron is very poor compared to that of copper. Referring now to Fig. 16, there is illustrated a soldering tip 35 and shank 36 of constant diameter.However, the shank 36 can be fixed in any desirable position by a slotted collet 80. Such a collet 80 is shown most clearly in Fig. 19 and Fig. 20, which is a front elevational view. This clearly shows that one side of the collet is cut through, as at 81, while the opposite side is partially cut, as shown at 82. The collet is retained by a retainer sleeve 62 which has a conical front end 83 making a tight fit with the collet 80. The retainer sleeve 62 may also be provided with an insert 84 having internal threads 85 and a retainer bushing 86.Therefore, by pulling the assembly rearwardly, the soldering tip 35 and shank 36 may be retained in any desired position. The length of the soldering tip and shank 36 and its distance from the heating element assembly determine the temperature that the soldering tip 35 attains. Also, if the soldering tip and shank are made of copper, they could be reworked if the tip is worn out, and the entire tip may be pushed forward and retained in its new position by the collet 80. Fig. 17 shows a different construction where the soldering tip 35 and shank 36 are fixed by a collar 69 which, in turn, is retained by the forward conical end 83 of the retainer sleeve 62. Another construction of the soldering tip is shown in Fig. 18. Here the tip consists of a copper core 86 which is surrounded by a stainless steel sleeve 87 which extends under the outer collar 88 of an iron shank 90 with a soldering tip 91. It will be noted that the inner core 89 is step wise reduced in diameter, as shown at 92 and 93, to correspond to the tapered outer end of the tip 91. It will be noted that the stainless steel sleeve 87 has a purpose to prevent corrosion of the copper core 89 and the solder or flux from running or wetting upwardly on the soldering shank. The construction of Fig. 18 has the advantage that it combines the high conductivity of copper with the high resistivity of iron to corrosion by flux and the like. On the other hand, this construction does not allow the possibility of reworking the tip. Hence, when the tip is worn out, the entire tip assembly must be discarded. Fig. 19 illustrates an exploded view of the construction of Fig. 16. It will be noted that the collet 80 is retained by the conical end 83 of the retainer sleeve 62, while its rearward shoulder 66 is held by the retainer bushing 86 which is capable of withstanding high temperatures. Fig. 21 again shows an inner heat accumulator like that of Fig. 12, but with a slightly modified construction. The inner heat accumulator 72 is again provided with external threads 71 to fit interior threads of the soldering tip 35 and its shank 68. This assembly is retained by the retainer sleeve 96 having a retainer bushing 97 internally threaded to fit on exterior threads 60 see Fig. 3 of the heater bushing 58. Fig. 22 shows a construction of soldering tip 35 and shank 36 and provided with a collar 69 so that it is not necessary to provide a collet. The assembly is again retained by the retainer sleeve 62 and the retainer bushing 65. It is also feasible to provide a soldering tip which can be reversed and hence has two working tips such as 35 and 100, as shown in Fig. 24. The shank 36 and tip 35 may be made of copper, while the tip 100 may consist of a high iron alloy having a press fit with the copper shank. Such a low carbon steel is called ingot iron and typically has the following analysis carbon .04x, manganese ,05X, phosphorus .007X, sulphur .020X, and a trace of silicon, the remainder being iron. Fig. 23 illustrates the tip of Fig. 24 in reverse posit ion. In this case a collet 80 may be utilized to retain the two tips 35 and 100 in their proper positions. Referring now to Figs. 25 to 30, there are illustrated two different ways for removing fumes which are created during the soldering process and to exhaust them away from the operator. Fig. 25 illustrates an air deflector baffle 101, shown more clearly in Fig. 27, which is substantially rectangular with a circular opening for the shank 36 and the soldering tip and which fits the retainer sleeve 62 in such a manner that openings such as 102 are left free.The fumes are then conducted through the interior of the retainer sleeve 62 and a tube 103 extending from the sleeve 62 and a flexible tube 104 through a filter 105 and a vacuum or pressure pump 106. When the pump 106 is operated as a vacuum pump, it will suck out the fumes adjacent to their point of origin that is, adjacent to the point where the flux and solder are heated, and they may be exhausted from the vacuum pump some distance away from the operator. In some cases it may be desirable to conduct the fumes through a special tube or hose which extends through the housing toward the rear of the instrument.Such a construction is shown in Fig. 26. Here again there is a baffle 101. From there the fumes are again guided through the inner surface of the retainer sleeve 62 and thence through a hose connection 107 which passes through housing 44 and out toward the rear of the housing.Again, the hose 107 may be suitably connected with a filter 105 and a pump 106. It should be noted that in the embodiment ofFig. 25 the pump 106 may also create an air pressure which forces the air through the retainer sleeve 62 and along the heating assembly 37 and past the baffle 101 toward the point where the soldering operation normally takes place. This hot air stream may be utilized for preheating circuit boards, drying and trouble shooting of live electronic circuit boards. Figs. 28 to 30 illustrate how the projections 56 on the inner surface of the housing 44 may be utilized to suspend one or two circuit boards or to create extra space for the hose 107, for example. Thus, in Fig. 28 there is a single circuit board 46 below projection 56 upon which various components may be maintained, as shown. Fig. 29 illustrates that it is also feasible to maintain two circuit boards 46 and 110 above and below projections 56, each of which may be provided with electronic components. This makes it possible to utilize a more sophisticated temperature control circuit, which usually requires more components. Alternatively, it is possible to maintain two separate circuits, each on one of the circuit boards 46, 110. Further, Fig. 30 illustrates a circuit board 46 maintained above the projections 56 to provide extra space for the hose 107 which is used in Fig. 26 to evacuate fumes. Finally, Fig. 31 shows how the soldering tool of the invention can readily be changed into a desoldering instrument. To this end, a special attachment may be used, such as a tube 113 and a hose 114 extending therefrom. These extend from the retainer sleeve 62, which at its rearward end has an internally threaded collar 115 which meshes with the exterior thread 43 forming part of the heating element assembly 37. The instrument is also provided with an internal heat accumulator 72 which extends through a hollow desoldering shank 117, and the exterior thread 71 of the accumulator 72 meshes with the corresponding interior thread of the desoldering shank 117 which is provided with a desoldering tip 118. Thus, the soldering tool of the invention may readily be converted into a desoldering tool, as shown in Fig. 31. It should be noted that an iron tip may be used with the soldering tool of the present invention, because it is feasible to utilize a heater element which can be used for extended periods of time at a much higher temperature than was hitherto possible. The instrument features a ceramic heater which is available as type FM 95 from Kyocera Corporation, a company of Kyoto, Japan. The heater may be utilized with 24v AC, 120v AC or 220v AC.Basically, the resistance material is applied to the ceramic and is subsequently heated and covered with a ceramic insulating material. The heater is of the PTC type that is, of the positive temperature coefficient type. The plastic materials which connect the soldering tip to the handle, such as the threaded collar 40, the retainer sleeve 62, the retainer bushing 65, etc., are preferably made of a plastic material, or of a metal, which has very poor heat conduction. Among these materials are polyphenylene sulfide PPS , acetal, and stainless steel. This construction, in turn, makes it possible to run the heater at a higher temperature than that of the soldering tip that is, at a temperature in excess of that required for soldering. It may also be noted that normally the threaded collar 40 may be sealed to cover the opening 45 so that the buyer or customer cannot change the set temperature of the heater. In other words, this adjustment is done at the factory and should usually not be changed by the customer. There has thus been disclosed a general purpose soldering tool adaptable for many purposes and capable of being used all day without damage. The heat transfer between the heating element assembly and the tip may be increased by a heat accumulator disposed either within or without the tip assembly. The fumes which usually are generated during soldering, particularly by the flux, may be removed either outside the retainer sleeve or directly from the handle by a pump. The instrument may be used either with copper or iron tips, either of which has special advantages and disadvantages. This is made possible by a heater capable of attaining higher temperatures and better heat insulation between the heating assembly and the handle. A special strain relief element has been shown which prevents the electric cord from being pulled out of the tool and at the same time indexes the circuit board. The circuit board, in turn, can assume several positions, and it is even feasible to provide two circuit boards, each with its own electronic components. By the provision of a collet it is feasible to adjust the position of the soldering tip, which in turn controls the temperature of the tip. Also, a longer tip permits to work between closely adjacent electronic components. If the tip consists of copper, it can be reworked and its distance from the retainer sleeve can be readjusted by the collet.
