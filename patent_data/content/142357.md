# AUTOMATIC DIMENSION ANALYZER

## Abstract
An automatic dimension analyzer is disclosed which comprises a power driven table 11 on which an object being measured is placed, the table being movable in orthogonal directions, and an optical system 13 for forming an optical image of the object in a sample point field. The sample point field is electronically scanned in a rectangular raster format to produce sample point data bits each representing a sample point having a predetermined optical level. A cursor generator 28 is synchronized with the raster to generate cursor in the sample point field. A coincidence detector 29, 23 is provided to detect a coincidence between a sample point data bit and the cursor. Measurement instructions are stored in sequentially addressible locations of a memory through a data entry means. A microprocessor 24 addresses the memory locations to retrieve the instruc tions to cause one of the table and the cursor to move relative to the other so that sample points derived from the object move toward the cursor and detect the position of the table or cursor relative to a reference upon the detection of a coincidence by the coincidence detector.
