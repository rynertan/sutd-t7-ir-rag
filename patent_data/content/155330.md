# An improved fluorometric assay.

## Abstract
A method is provided to fluorometrically determine a ligand in an assay solution containing the ligand, reagent system and a fluorescer wherein the intensity of the fluorescer emitted by the assay solution is related to the change in the transmittive properties of the assay solution produced by the interaction of the ligand to be determined and a reagent system capable of producing a change in the transmittive properties of the assay solution in the presence of the ligand. In addition, novel reagent compositions are provided which may be utilized to either spectrophotometric ally or fluorometrically determine the concentration of a ligand in an assay solution.
