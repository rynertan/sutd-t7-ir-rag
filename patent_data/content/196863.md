# Cooling system for electronic circuit components.

## Abstract
A cooling system for electronic circuit components 2 mounted on a printed circuit board 1 includes a cooling plate 20 having a coolant passage 21 therein, thermal contacts 26 arranged on the cooling plate to be in resilient contact with the surfaces of the electronic components, which are cooled, via the thermal contacts, by liquid coolant flowing through the coolant passage. The cooling plate has one or more bypass passages 25 therein, the cross sectional area of which is smaller than that of the coolant passage, to interconnect predetermined portions of the coolant passage. The liquid coolant can be discharged from the cooling plate via the bypass passages, so that the cooling plate can be completely emptied when so desired.
