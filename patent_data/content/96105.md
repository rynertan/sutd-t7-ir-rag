# INSTANT START SOLID STATE BALLAST FOR FLUORESCENT AND GAS DIS CHARGE LAMPS

## Abstract
The standart Ballasts and starters used for the fluores cent lamps are based on the voltage kicks of a dying magnetic field in iron core. This is a somewhat artificial way of obtaining the voltage gradient necessary to establish an arc in the long vacuum tube. To facilitate this arc a cathode heating has been added for electron emission and arc starting. In the new design 1 Instead of a weak voltage increase a dependable high voltage level is created by the sound autotransformer principle. 2 Instead of having the fully rated voltage primary coil, a much shorter one is subjected to the rated voltage for a few seconds and also protected from damage by a carefully chosen PTC Positif Temperature Coefficient Thermistor to separate the primary from the rated voltage circuit. 3 Therefore, with the aid of the PTC, from a 1 2 ratio autotransforme a voltage of 3 x V rated is obtained instantly. 4 This very short durated voltage is enough to strike an arc even for a very low 140 V network and light a lamp without a starter. 5 This high voltage is harmless since it has the secondary coil in series as a ballast in the lamp circuit.
