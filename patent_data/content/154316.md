## Description
Chemically Modified Lymphokine and Production Thereof Lymphokines such as interferons hereinafter sometimes abbreviated as IFNs and interleukin 2 hereinafter sometimes abbreviated as IL 2 have been considered to be of clinical value for the treatment of viral infections and malignancies and recent technological advances in genetic engineering have made it in principle possible to produce such lymphokines on large scales. However, it is known that the clearance of lymphokines administered to the living body is in general very short. In the case of lymphokines derived from heterologous animals, it is anticipated that antibodies may be produced in some instances and cause severe reaction such as anaphylaxis.Therefore, technology development is desired which leads to delayed clearance of lymphokines used as drugs, with their activity retained, and further to decrease in their antigenicity. To achieve this object, chemical modification of lymphokines is a very effective means. Such chemical modification is expected to result in delayed clearance in the living body, decreased antigenicity and, further, increased physiological activiy. From the practical viewpoint, the significance of chemical modification of lymphokines is thus very great. Generally, in chemically modified physiologically active proteins, a method is required by which said proteins can be chemically modified while retaining their physiological activity. Polyethylene glycol methyl ether is considered to have no antigenicity and therefore is used in chemical modification of proteins. The introduction of said substance into proteins is generally performed by way of the intermediary of cyanuric chloride. However, cyanuric chloride is toxic per se and the possible toxicity of its degradation products in vivo remains open to question. Therefore, cyanuric chloride should be used with caution. Furthermore, the reaction involved requires a pH on the alkaline side and therefore the above mentioned method of modification has a drawback in that it cannot be applied to proteins liable to inactivation under alkaline conditions. U. S. Patent No. 4,002,531 discloses a method of producing monoalkylpolyethylene glycol derivatives of enzymes. However, the method disclosed therein, which uses sodium borohydride at pH 8.5, when applied to lymphokines, may possibly destroy the physiological activity of lymphokines and therefore cannot serve as an effective method of production. Furthermore, said patent specification does not any suggestion as to the effect of delaying the in vivo clearance of the enzyme derivatives. Such effect is therefore unknown. There is also known a method of introducing a low molecular aldehyde such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, benzaldehyde or pyridoxal into physiologically active proteins in the presence of a boron containing reducing agent Methods inEnzymology, 47, 469 478 1977 Japanese Patent UnexaminedPublication No. 154,596 83 . However, application of said method to lymphokines fails to achieve effective delay in clearance. A substantial decrease in antigenicity cannot be expected but rather it is possible that the low molecular aldehyde introduced may serve as a hapten to thereby provide said lymphokines with immunogenicity. The present inventors studied intensively to overcome the above difficulties and have now completed the present invention. This invention provides chemically modified lymphokines having polyethylene glycol of the formula RO CH2 CH2 z I wherein R is a protective group for the terminal oxygen atom and n is an optional positive integer, bonded directly to at least one primary amino group of the lymphokine moiety and a method of producing the same. In the present specification, the term lymphokine includes soluble factors released from lymphocytes and involved in cellular immunity and substances equivalent thereto in physiological activity. Thus, the lymphokines may be genetically engineered products, products derived from various animals including humans and further include substances similar in structure and in physiological activity to these. For instance, there may be mentioned various interferons interferon a IFN a , interferon 6 IFN ss , interferonY IFN y ,J, IL 2, macrophage differentiating factor MDF , macrophage activating factor MAF , tissue plasminogen activator, and substances similar in structure and in physiological activity to these. Examples of said substances similar in structure and in physiological activity are substances having the structure of IFN y except for the lack of 2 to 4 amino acids at theN terminal thereof PCT JP84 00292, filed June 6, 1984 , various IFN y fragments lacking in the C terminal portion of IFN gamma e.g. 15K species EPC Patent Application No.Q Ill 3 .9 , substances having the structure of IL 2 except for the lack of the N terminal amino acid thereof EPC laid open 91539 or the lack of 4 amino acids from the N terminal Japanese Patent Application 58 235638, filed December 13, 1983 and substances having the structure of IL 2 except for the lack of one or more constituent amino acids with or without one or more substitute amino acids in place of said missing one or ones, for example the IL2 analog containing serine in lieu of the 125th amino acid cysteine EPC laid open 104798 . Preferred among such lymphokines are IFN a. IFN y consisting of 146 amino acids EPC laid open 0089676 ,IFN y lacking in two N terminal amino acids IFN y d2 ,IFN y lacking in three N terminal amino acids IFN y d3 , and IL 2. The lymphokines to be used in the practice of the invention preferably have a molecular weight of 5,000 to 50,000, more preferably 10,000 to 30,000. The primary amino group of lymphokines includes theN terminal a amino group and the amino group of the lysine residue. Referring to the group represented by the above formula I , the terminal oxygen protecting group R is, for example, an alkyl or alkanoyl group. The alkyl group is preferably an alkyl of 1 to 18 carbon atoms, more preferably a lower C1 4 alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, i propyl, butyl, i butyl, sec butyl or t butyl. The alkanoyl group is preferably an alkanoyl of 1 to 8 carbon atoms, more preferably a lower C1 6 alkanoyl, such as formyl, acetyl, propionyl, butyryl, i butyryl or caproyl. The positive integer n is preferably not more than 500, more preferably 7 to 120. The group of formula I preferably has a molecular weight of not more than 25,000, more preferably 350 to 6,000.From the viewpoints of physiological activity retention and clearance delaying effect, the group of formula I preferably has a molecular weight corresponding to 1 to 10 , more preferably 2 to 5 of the molecular weight of the lymphokine to be modified. The chemically modified lymphokines according to the invention have the group of formula I directly bonded to at least one of the primary group of the corresponding lymphokines. When the N terminal amino group is the only primary amino group in the lymphokine to be modified, the modified lymphokine has the group of formula I directly bonded to said amino group. When the lymphokine to be modified has one or more lysine residues in its molecule, the modified lymphokine has the group of formula I directly bonded to some percentage, preferably 15 to 80 on the average , of said amino groups. In this case, the N terminal amino group may have or may not have the group of formula I directly bonded thereto. The chemically modified lymphokines according to the invention can be produced, for example, by reacting a lymphokine with the the aldehyde of the formula RtO CH,CH,, O CH2CHO II wherein R and n are as defined above, in the presence of a reducing agent. As the boron containing reducing agent to be used as conducting the reaction, there may be mentioned sodium borohydride and sodium cyanoborohydride. Among them, more preferred is sodium cyanoborohydride from the viewpoint of selectivity of reaction or possibility of carrying out the reaction in the neighborhood of neutrality. In carrying out the reaction, the aldehdye II is used in an amount of about 1 to 10,000 moles per mole of the lymphokine, and the boron containing reducing agent is used in an amount of about 1 to 100 moles per mole of the lymphokine. The degree of modification can be selected as desired by varying the mole ratio between lymphokine and aldehyde II . The solvent to be used in carrying out the invention may be any solvent which does not disturb the reaction and is, for example, a buffer such as a phosphate or borate buffer. An organic solvent which does not inactivate lymphokines or disturb the reaction, such as lower alkanol e.g.methanol, ethanol, i propanol or acetonitrile, may be added.The reaction may be conducted within a broad pH range of 3 to 14 but is preferably perfomred in the vicinity of neutrality pH 6.5 7.5 . The reaction temperature may be selected within a broad range of 0 to 800C, preferably 0 to 50 C, so as not to cause denaturation of lymphokines. A period of 0.5 to 100 hours, generally 10 to 80 hours, will be sufficient for the reaction. The desired, chemically modified lymphokines can be obtained by purifying the reaction mixture by dialysis, salting out, ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration, high perfonxnce Liquid chranatography, electrophoresis, or the like ordinary method of purifying proteins.The degree of modification of the amino group or groups can be calculated by acid degradation followed by amino acid analysis, for instance. The above mentioned aldehyde II can be produced from an ethylene glycol derivative of the formula R FO CH2CH2 t QH III wherein R and n are as defined above, for instance. The following is a method of producing the same which is advantageous in that the production of the corresponding byproduct carboxylic acid is little. Thus, the compound III is oxidized with pyridinium chlorochromate in a haloalkane solvent such as methylene chloride or chloroform. In this case, pyridinium chlorochromate is used in an amount of 1 to 3 moles per mole of compound III and the reaction is carried out at 10 to 5qOC, preferably at room temperature, for 1 to 30 hours. Treatment of compound III n l with potassium butoxide in t butanol followed by reaction with a bromoacetal and treatment with an acid such as an organic acid e.g. trifluoroacetic acid or an inorganic acid e.g. hydrochloric or sulfuric acid can also give the corresponding aldehyde II which is longer in chain length by O CH2CH2 than compound III . In this case, 10 to 30 moles, per mole of compound III , of potassium t butoxide is added to the above compound and, after dissolution, 3 to 15 moles, per mole of compound III , of a bromoacetal is added, followed by reaction at 10 to 80 C for 0.5 to 5 hours. After treatment of the reaction mixture in the conventional manner, the product is dissolved in a dilute aqueous solution of the above mentioned acid, followed by heating for 5 minutes to 2 hours. In each case, the reaction mixture can be subjected to purification process conventional in the field of chemistry, such as extraction, concentration, recrystallization, reprecipitation, chromatography and or distillation. The chemically modified lymphokines according to the invention have useful physiological activities similar to those of the corresponding known, unmodified lymphokines and are useful as drugs, among others. The chemically modified lymphokines according to the invention exhibit delay in clearance in vivo as compared with the corresponding known, unmodified lymphokines and are low in toxicity and antigenicity and can be used safely for the same purposes and in the same manner as in the case of known lymphokines. The chemically modified lymphokines according to the invention can usually be administered to mammals monkey, dog, pig, rabbit, mouse, human either orally or parenterally in the form of aspropriate pharmaceutical compositions prepared by using carriers, diluents, etc., which are known in themselves. Thus, for instance, chemically modified IFN a according to the invention, when used as an antiviral agent, is recommendably administered to human adults once a day by intravenous injection in a dose of 1 x 104 to 1 x 9 international units. In the present specification, the amino acids, when referred to by abbreviations, are abbreviated according toIUPAC IUB Commision of Biological Nomenclature .

The eluate was collected in 5 ml portions. Eluate fractions 100 150 ml containing the contemplated product were combined.Assaying by the Lowly method using bovine serum albumin as a standard revealed that the protein content in the combined fractions was 84 ug ml. Amino acid ratios in acid hydrolysate 6 N hydrochloric acid, 1100C, 24 hours were as follows Asp, 12.2 12 Thr, 10.4 10 Ser, 16.0 14 Glu, 24.8 26 Pro, 6.0 5 Gly, 6.3 5 Ala, 8.6 8 Val, 6.5 7 Met, 4.0 5 Ile, 7.6 8 Leu, 21.0 21 Tyr, 5.2 5 Phe, 9.9 10 Lys, 6.5 His, 3.8 3 Arg, 9.1 9 Cys, Trp, decomposed.In view of the fact that rIFR oA contains 11 Lys residues, the above results led to a conclusion that about 41 of Lys residues in interferon a had been modified at the amino group with the polyethylene glycol methyl ether. average molecular weight 1,900 . The potency of this product as determined by the enzyme immunoassay method Methods in Enzymology, 79, 589595 1981 1 was 1.51x 107 international units mg and the antiviral activity as determined by the method described in Journal of Virology, 37, 755 758 1981 was 0.57 x 107 international units mg. This product IFA 3 was submitted to a clearance test in rats as mentioned later herein. ii Using 100 mg of the polyethylene glycol methyl ether aldehyde obtained in Reference Example 1 and having an average molecular weight of 750 and 100 mg of sodium cyanoborohydride, rIFN alpha A was treated in the same manner as i to give 30 ml of a solution of polyethylene glycol methyl ether modif ed IFN alpha with a protein content of 130 g ml.Amino acid ratios in acid hydrolysate 6 N hydrochloric acid 1100C, 24 hours were as follows Asp. 12.1 12 Thr, 10.1 10 Ser, 13.6 14 Glu, 26.7 26 Pro, 5.5 5 Gly, 5.6 5 Ala, 8.4 8 Val, 6.7 7 Met, 5.5 5 Ile, 7.4 8 Leu, 21.0 21 Tyr, 5.1 5 Phe, 9.6 10 Lys, 4.7 His, 3.5 3 Arg, 9.1 9 Trp, 1.8 2 Cys, decomposed. The above data indicate that about 57 of Lys residues had been modified at the amino group. Enzyme immunoassay performed in the 6.same manner as i gave the result 5 x 10 international units mg, and the antiviral activity of the product was 0.14 x 108 international units mg. iii The procedure of i was followed using 27 mg of the polyethylene glycol methyl ether aldehyde and 27 mg of sodium cyanoborohydride and there was obtained 50 ml of a polyethylene glycol methyl ether modified IFN a solution with a protein content of 45 iig ml. Amino acid ratios in acid hydrolysate 6 N hydrochloric acid, 1100C, 24 hours gave the following results Asp, 13.6 12 Thr, 10.4 10 Ser, 14.9 14 Glu, 26.6 26 Pro, 5.5 5 Gly, 6.1 5 Ala, 8.3 8 Val, 6.6 7 Met, 5.2 5 Ile, 7.4 8 Leu, 21.0 21 Tyr, 5.3 5 Phe, 10.2 10 Lys, 9.0 His, 3.6 t3 Arg, 9.1 9 Trp, 2.3 2 Cys, decomposed.The above data indicate that about 18 of Lys residues had been modified at the amino group. Enzyme immunoassay performed in the same manner as i gave the result 1.09 x 108 international units mg and the antiviral activity of this product was 1.53 x 108 international units g. iv The chemically modified IFN alpha IFA 3 of the inven tion as obtained above in i was administered to a group of three 7 week old female SD rats by injection into the femoral muscle in a dose of 1.274 x 106 units per capita. After a prescribed period, blood was sampled from the caudal vein and the IFE a potency in plasma was determined by the enzyme immunoassay method and antiviral activity method described in Example 1 i . A distinct delay in clearance was observed as compared with a group administered unmodified interferon alpha rIFN alpha A in a dose of 1.259 x 106 units per capita. The above results are depicted in Fig. 1. Examnle 2 To 5 ml of the solution of chemically modified IFN a IFA 3 of the invention as obtained in Example I i , there is added 250 mg of human serum albumin. The resulting solution is filtered through a membrane filter pore size 0.2 Wm and distributed into 5 vials, followed by lyophili zation and storage. The contents of each vial are dissolved in 1 ml of distilled water for injection just prior to use.Example 3 Production of polyethylene glycol methyl ether modified IFN a and alkanoyl polyethylene glycol modified IFN a i The title compounds were synthesized by using the polyethylene glycol methyl ether aldehyde and alkanoylpolyethylene glycol aldehyde obtained in Reference Example 1 and Reference Example 2, respectively, and following the procedure of Example 1. Various data for each derivative synthesized are shown in Table 1 and amino acid analysis data therefor in Table 2. ii The chemically modified IFN a species obtained in i above compounds No. 2 and No. 8 were administered to 7week old female SD rats in groups of 3 by intramuscular injection into the femur in doses of 3.12 x 106 units and 2.66 x 106 units, respectively.

The resulting precipitate was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was concentrated to 10 ml using a Diaflow membrane Amicon .The concentrate was applied to a Sephadex G 75 column 3.0 x 43.0 cm and developed with 25 mM ammonium acetate buffer pH 6.0 0.15 M sodium chloride 10 mM glutathione. The eluate was fractionated in 5 ml portions. Fractions Nos.17 24 containing the desired product were combined. The protein content in the combined fractions as determined by the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin as a standard was 7.73 Vg ml. The acid hydrolysate 6 N hydrochloric acid, llO C, 24 hours gave the following amino acid analysis values Asp, 19.6 20 Thr, 4.7 5 Ser, 8.3 11 ,Glu, 18.5 18 Pro, 2.1 2 Gly, 5.4 5 Ala, 7.5 8 Val, 8.4 8 Met, 3.7 4 Ile, 7.1 7 Leu, 9.7 10 , Tyr, 5.3 5 Phe, 9.7 10 Lys, 17.6 His, 2.0 2 Arg, 5.0 8 Cys, Trp, decomposed. Since rIFN y contains 20Lys residues, the above results indicate that about 12 of theLys Amino groups in rIFN y had been modified by polyethylene glycol methyl ether average molecular weight 750 .The product had an antiviral activity of 1.3 x 106 international units mg. Administration of the product to rats resulted in obvious delay in clearance in blood. On the other hand, the precipitate was dissolved in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and dialyzed against 25 mM ammonium acetate pH 6.0 0.15 M sodium chloride 10 mM glutathione at 40C overnight, followed by Sephadex G 75 gel filtration in the same manner as above.The thus purified fraction 25 ml had a protein content of 126 ug ml and amino acid analysis of the acid hydrolysate 6 N hydrochloric acid, 1100C, 24 hours gave the following values Asp, 20.0 20 Thr, 5.2 5 Ser, 9.5 11 Glu, 27.8 18 Pro, 2.7 2 Gly, 14.6 5 Ala, 8.1 8 Val, 8.5 8 Met, 4.3 4 Ile, 7.2 7 Leu, 10.2 10 Tyr, 5.8 5 Phe, 10.1 10 Lys, 14.7 His, 2.0 2 Arg, 7.3 8 Thr, 0.7 1 Cys, decomposed.The higher values for Glu and Gly than the theoretical are presumably due to contamination by glutathione.
