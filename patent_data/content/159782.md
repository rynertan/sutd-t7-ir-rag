# High efficiency air filter.

## Abstract
A high efficiency particulate air filter 16 is disclosed which has a channel formed in the front peripheral surface thereof, with the channel being substantially filled with a seal ant 30 which comprises an essentially non volatile and non hardening gum like material. The physical properties of the sealant render the sealant able to effect sealing engagement with a mating flange 45 mounted in the filter housing, and also permit the flange to be withdrawn from the sealant with out an appreciable amount of the sealant adhering to the flange, to thereby avoid the build up of potentially contami nated sealant on the flange when the filter is changed. A meth od of fabricating the filter is also disclosed, which results in the sealant forming a substantially uniform and continuous closed strip which is characterized by the absence of a butt end joint.
