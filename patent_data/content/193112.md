## Description
flMA ENCIODTNG MAMMALIAN INSULIN LIKE GROWTH FACTOR II Ba√ßkaround of the InventionThis invention was made in part with Government support by a grant from the National Institute of Health, Department of Health and Human Services. The Government has certain rights in this invention.Throughout this application various publications are referenced by numbers within parentheses. Full citations for these publications may be found at the end of the specification immediately preceding the claims.The disclosures of these publications in their entireties are hereby incorporated by reference into this application in order to more fully describe the state of the art to which this invention pertains.The somatomedins SMs or insulin like growth factors IGFs , which have a structural resemblance to proinsulin, are mitogenic polypeptides that were thought to mediate the effects of the growth hormone somatotropin on skeletal tissue see ref. 1 4 for reviews . Though this may be true for one of the two known SMs IGF I , the other IGF II , which is presumably involved in fetal development, seems to be under the influence of placental lactogen, but not of growth hormone 5,6 .The structures of human IGF I hIGF I or SM C and IGFII hIGF II or SM A have been determined 7 9 . A rat basic SM, isolated from serum, has been partially sequenced 10 , and it seems that it corresponds to hIGFI. A second rat SM previously designated multiplication stimulating activity MSA , purified from serum free medium conditioned by the Buffalo rat liver cell line BRL 3A 11 , was shown by sequencing 12 to be the rat equivalent of hIGF II rIGF II .Peptide alignments with proinsulin B chain C peptide A chain , show that the following regions can be defined in the sequences of the IGFs Domains B, C and A. TheIGFs also contain a fourth domain, D, which is not present in proinsulin 13 . The limited amino acid sequence homology between the two types of molecules is res tr ict ed to the B and A domains. In contrast to insulin, which is generated from proinsulin by elimination or the middle C peptide, the C domain of the SMs remains in the active form of the molecules.The structural similarities between proinsulin and IGFs suggested common ancestry of the corresponding genes 1 . Thus, to expand our previous studies on the evo lution 14 16 and expression 17 of insulin genes to other putative members of the insulin like gene family, we cloned rIGF II cDNA. This invention concerns the characterization of the mRNA species which encodes the protein precursor of rIGF II. The invention also concerns transcripts that partially overlap the sequence of this message. We show that the family of these transcripts exhibits developmental and tissue specificity.After completion of the experimental part of this work, two reports appeared describing the characterization of cDNA clones of the same sequence 18, 19 . However, there are discrepancies between these reports and our data. The discrepancies concern the nucleotide sequence of various regions of the molecule and will be discussed in detail below. Summary of the InventionA cDNA molecule encoding mammalian insulin like growth factor II has been discovered. A specific embodiment of the invention concerns a cDNA molecules encoding pre pro rat insulin like growth factor II. The nucleotide sequence of one such cDNA molecule encoding prepro rIGF II is shown in Fig. 1 b. These molecules or restriction fragments of these DNA molecules may be inserted into recombinant cloning vehicles and then introduced into host cells.The host cells containing the recombinant cloning vehicle with an inserted DNA sequence encoding mammalianIGF II may be cultured or grown under suitable conditions permitting the expression of the DNA encoding mammalian IGF II. The mammalian IGF II so produced can then be recovered using techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The invention also concerns mammalian insulin like growth factor polypeptides produced according to the methods of this invention.cDNA molecules which correspond to different mRNA transcripts encoding mammalian insulin like growth factor II polypeptides may also be produced. It has been discovered that some of these mRNA transcripts are predominantly expressed in specific tissues.These mRNA transcript molecules may exist as components of a heterologous population of a plurality mRNA molecules isolated from mammalian cells. cDNA molecules can be made corresponding to each of these mRNA transcripts. The cDNA of these transcripts can be inserted into a recombinant cloning vehicles and then into host cells. The host cells containing the recombinant cloning vehicles can be used according to the methods of this invention to produce tissue specific mammalian insulin like growth factor II polypeptides.The invention also concerns a synthetic single strandedDNA molecule encoding the first 13 amino acid residues of the A domain of rat insulin like growth factor II. Single stranded DNA molecules complementary to theseDNA molecules along with restriction fragments of DNA molecules encoding pre pro rIGF II may be labeled with detectable markers and used in methods for isolating cDNA molecules encoding other mammalian insulin like growth factors lis. These methods of obtaining cDNA molecules encoding a mammalian insulin like growth factor II comprise isolating poly A mRNA from mammalian cells and using the RNA so isolated as a template for the synthesis of cDNA. The cDNA is cloned in a suitable recombinant cloning vehicle and in a suitable host cell in order to obtain a cDNA library. The cDNA library is then screened using one of the DNA molecules labeled with a detectable marker as a hybridization probe. The cDNA molecules that hybridize to the probe and therefore encode a growth factor II are identified and isolated.

Detailed Description of the InventionA cDNA molecule encoding a mammalian insulin like growth factor II polypeptide have been obtained. cDNA molecules can be synthesized which correspond to any of the mRNA transcript molecules which encode mammalian insulin like growth factor II polypeptides. Reterogeneous populations of mRNA transcripts which encode a mammalian insulin like growth factor II polypeptide have been discovered. cDNA molecules may been synthesized from these mRNA transcripts, e.g. with reverse transcriptase. In certain embodiments of the invention the heterologous mRNA population consists of a plurality of mRNA molecules e.g. at least three mRNA transcripts. From these mRNA molecules a heterologous population of cDNA molecules encoding a mammalian insulin like growth factor II can be produced.For example in one embodiment of the invention a heterogeneous plurality of mRNA transcripts encoding rat insulin like growth factor II polypeptides has been isolated. This population consists of at least three mRNA transcript molecules, three of which are about 3.4 kb, 1.75 kb and 1.6 kb in length each. Heterologous populations of cDNA molecules may be synthesized which correspond to these mRNA transcript molecules. It has also been discovered that these different mRNA transcripts may be predominantly expressed in specific tissues, e.g. the 1.6 kb and 1.75 kb rat IGF II mRNA transcripts in brain and lung tissue, and the 3.4 kb rat IGF II mRNA transcript in neonatal tissue and muscle tissue. cDNA molecules encoding these different transcripts can be produced and inserted into recombinant cloning vehicles. The recombinant cloning vehicles containing these cDNAs could then be introduced into host cells in order to produce different tissue specific rIGF II polypeptide molecules.Other mammalian cells e.g. bovine, procine, ovine, caprine human etc , may also contain such heterologous populations of a plurality of mRNA transcripts. The individual mRNA transcripts in these populations may also be predominantly expressed in specific tissues.cDNAs could then be made of the different mRNA transcripts and inserted into recombinant cloning vehicles.The recombinant cloning vehicles containing the different cDNA molecules could be introduced into host cells so that the cDNA could be expressed and different tissue specific mammalian insulin like growth factor II polypeptides could be produced and isolated. These tissue specific mammalian growth factor II polypeptides could be useful in methods affecting the growth of mammals.A cDNA molecule encoding pre pro rat insulin like growth factor II has been obtained. This cDNA molecule has been restriction mapped and sequenced and these maps and sequences are depicted in Figure 1.The cDNA molecules and restriction fragments of this invention may be inserted into recombinant cloning vehicles e.g. plasmids, cosmids or X phage using methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The recombinant cloning vehicles can than be introduced into host cells, such as bacteria e.g. E. coli or eucaryotic cells, e.g. CHO cells, or yeast, using re combinant, transformation or other methods known to those skilled in the art.These host cells containing the recombinant cloning vehicles with cDNA inserts encoding mammalian IGF II can be used in methods of producing mammalian IGF II polypeptidesf e.g. rIGF II, pre pro rIGF II. The methods comprise culturing or growing the host cells under suitable conditions known to those skilled in the art, which permit the expression of the DNA encoding the mEDalian IGF II. The mammalian IGF II is then recovered from the cells or the surrounding medium using suitable methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art.The invention also concerns the synthesis of a singlestranded DNA molecule encoding the first 13 amino acid residues of the A domain of rat insulin like growth factor II. The synthesis of this molecule is described below and the molecule itself is depicted in Figure lb.A single stranded DNA molecule complementary to this cDNA molecule has also been produced by using the cDNA molecule as a template for reverse transcriptase.The cDNA molecule encoding the first 13 amino acids of the A domain of rIGF II, its complementary DNA molecule and DNA molecules which are restriction fragments of the cDNA molecule encoding pre pro rIGF IT may all be used as hybridization probes for cDNAs encoding other mammalian insulin like growth factor II molecules e.g bovine, porcine, or ovine insulin like growth factor IT, These mammalian insulin like growth factors may be useful in methods of controlling growth in mammals. To be used as probes these DNA molecules must be labeled with a detectable marker, e.g. radioactive, fluorescent and enzymatic markers. Methods of labeling DNA molecules are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.The methods of the invention for obtaining cDNA encoding a mammalian insulin like growth factor II comprise isolating poly A mRNA from mammalian cells using the standard procedures known to those of ordinary skill in the art. These mRNA molecules are then used as a template for the synthesis of cDNA, e.g. by reverse transcriptase. The cDNA is then cloned in a suitable cloning vehicle and in a suitable host cell in order to obtain a cDNA library, using standard recombinant DNA techniques such as those described below. The cDNA library so produced is then screened by using one of the DNA molecules labeled with a detectable marker and described above as a hybridization probe. The cDNA molecules that encode the mammalian insulin like growth factor II and hybridize to the probe are then identified and isolated using the techniques described below. MATERIALS AND METHODSMaterialsRestriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs orBethesda Research Laboratories. T4 DNA ligase and EcoRI linkers were from New England Biolabs. SI nuclease and T4 polynucleotide kinase were from Bethesda Research Laboratories. T4 DNA polymerase was from F LBiochemicals. Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polynierase was from Boehringer Mannheim. Reverse transcriptase was from Life Sciences. Placental ribonuclease inhibitor RNasin was from Promeca Biotec. Bacterial alkaline phosphatase was from Worthington. Nylon membranes Gene Screen Plus , a 32P dNTPs 800 Ci mmole andy 32P ATP 3000 Ci mmole were from New England Nuclear.DNA oligonucleotides were chemically synthesized using the Applied Bio systems 380A DNA Synthesizer. Bacteriophage vector X gel and plasmid vector pUC9 were provided by T.Buynh and 3. Messing, respectively. The BRL 3A cell line is widely available and can be obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, 12301 Parklawn Drive,Rockville, Md., 20852, where it is deposited under accession number ATCC CRL 1442.RNA PurificationCytoplasmic RNA was extracted as described 23 and further purified by oligo dT cellulose chromatography.Total RNA was prepared by the guanidinium isothiocynate Cscl procedure 24 . Recomkinant DNk Procedures Double stranded cDNA was synthesized as described 23 using as a primer oligo dT and as a template cytoplasmic poly A RNA from BRL 3A cells. The ends of the double stranded cDNAs were made flush by treatment withT4 DNA polymerase, and the molecules were cloned as described 23 into the vector X gtlO, following attachment of Eco RI linkers. Screening of the library was performed as described 25 .The radioactive probe to isolate rIGF II cDNA was made as follows We first synthesized a message like DNA 39mer, corresponding to the first 13 amino acid residues of the A domain of rIGF II see Fig. lb . For the third position of the two fold degenerate codons in the middle of the oligonucleotide we used both of the alternative bases, while for the rest of the codons the base of the third position was selected either at random or by giving advantage to possible G U base pairing. We then synthesized a lOmer, complementary to the 3 terminal region of the 39mer. Following annealing of the two oligonucleotides, the lOmer was extended with labeled triphosphates using the Klenow enzyme. It is our experience that this strategy is superior to the use of a mixture of shorter oligonucleotides containing all possible combinations.The success of this approach is due to the higher specific activity of the probe that can be obtained in contrast to end labeled oligonucleotides . Moreover, nucleation events in the middle of the probe where an exact complement in relatively high representation is encountered minimize the disadvantages of possible mismatches at the two ends.A chromosomal DNA clone was isolated by screening with cloned cDNAs 6x105 plaques of a genomic rat DNA library provided by T. Sargent . This library had been constructed by partial digestion of rat chromosomal DNA with Hae III, and the attachment of Eco RI linkers to the resulting fragments prior to ligation to X Charon 4A arms.RNA and DNA AnalysesFor Northern analysis, RNA was electrophoresed on formaldehyde agarose gels and then transferred onto nylon membranes. Prehybridization and hybridization were as described 26 , except when oligonucleotide probes were used hybridization at 370c, in 258 formamide . As probes we used labeled oligonucleotides see above nick translated cloned restriction fragments or uni formly labeled single strands synthesized on M13 templates by a modification of a published procedure 27 .The inserts of the isolated cDNA clones were sub clone into M13mp9, M3mplO, or pUC9 for DNA sequencing, which was performed by the enzymatic method 28 , using reverse transcriptase, or, in certain cases, by the chemical method 29 , for verification. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION TgoA ation and Characterization of rIGF tI cDNA ClonesFor the isolation of rIGF II cDNA clones we first examined whether a radioactive antimessage probe, synthesized from a synthetic DNA template corresponding to the first 13 amino acid residues of the A domain of rIGF II see Materials and Methods and Fig. lb , could hybridize to cytoplasmic poly A RNA from the BRL 3A cell line. Northern analysis shows that an RNA species approximately 3.4 kb in length gave a strong hybridization signal.Northern analysis of cytoplasmic poly A RNA from BRL3A cells was carried out as follows The RNA 10 11 g per lane was electrophoresed on a 1 agarose formaldehyde gel and then transferred onto a nylon membrane.The following probes were used the labeled antimessage oligonucleotide corresponding to the beginning of the A domain , synthesized on a syntheticDNA template see Fig. la and b . A uniformly labeled single stranded probe synthesized from a clone Ilc Fig. la template, in Ml3. Because of the low concentration of the a 32P dNTPs during this reaction which was not followed by chase , the synthesis was limited and the probe represented primarily 3 noncoding region see Fig. la . Sequential hybridization analysis was also performed. The following probes were used for sequential hybridization on the same membrane.A probe generated by nick translation of the Eco RI Eco RII fragment of clone 27 see Fig. la . A uniformly labeled single stranded probe sequence in Fig. 2 to position 274 . The faint hybridization of the 3.4 kb of clone l9f homologous to this message see Fig. 2 .Labeled Hinf fragments of pBR322 were used as size markers. The slowest migrating band was determined to be a partial digestion product.We then constructed a cDNA library of 1.5x106 recombinants from the BRL 3A RNA into the vector X gtlO.Following library amplification, we screened 4.5x105 plaques with the same probe and identified 32 positive plaques, 25 of which were also positive upon rescreening. Sequencing of the insert of one of these clones clone 14, Fig. la identified a region of homology to the synthetic probe and a reading frame corresponding to the known amino acid sequence 12 of the A and D domains of rIGF II. Cross hybridization of a clone 14 probe to the other 24 positive clones indicated that 11 of them carried rIGFIT sequence, while the rest were fortuitous hybridizers. Selected. overlapping clones of the positive group Fig. la were also sequenced. Northern analysis of BRL 3A RNA using a 3 non coding region probe from clone llc showed that the same 3.4 kb RNA species hybridizing to the synthetic probe also hybridized to rIGF II cDNA sequence.A composite of our sequencing data is presented in Fig. ib. Since the total length of the DNA sequence that we have established is 1016 nt, we are missing approximately 2.4 kb of the sequence of the 3.4 kb mRNA. A primer extension experiment suggested that the 5 end of the sequence is probably close to the 5 end of the 3.4 kb tRNA. As a primer for this extension we used a 536 nt long single stranded antimessage DNA fragment Fig. la , with a 3 end mapping at a Pvu II site position 222 of the sequence . The longest abundant transcript we detected was approximately 1 kb in length. Assuming that this product does not correspond to a strong stop for reverse transcriptase, we calcu late that the extended sequence 1000 536 464 nt is only slightly longer than the distance between the PvuII site and the 5 end of the sequence 444 nt .We note, however, that at least two other very faint bands of extension products, that can be seen only on the original autoradiogram, were longer than 1 kb. Their appearance might be due to rIGF II related sequences see below . Thus, we tentatively conclude that most of the unknown sequence of the 3.4 kb mRNA corresponds to 3 noncoding region.By identifying the rIGF II residues in the sequence ofFig. lb, and extending the translation frame upstream, we assigned the Met at amino acid position 24 as the initiator We believe that this interpretation is correct because no other ATG triplets are present in the sequence between the 24 Met and the first upstream terminator TGA at position 144 in the same reading frame. Moreover, the first 23 amino acid residues of this precursor, which presumably serve as a signal peptide for the secretory rIGF II, contain a hydrophobic core, characteristic of all known preregions 30 .Thus, the putative pre pro rIGF II 179 residues consists of a signal peptide 23 residues , the previously recognized 12 rIGF II sequence 67 residues B domain 32 residues, C domain 8residues, A domain 21 residues, D domain 6 residues , and a trailer polypeptide 89 residues , until the first terminator is encountered. This structure is the same at that of pre prohIGF II 18, 22 , and analogous to that of pre prohIGF I 21 , despite the dissimilarities between the two human factors in the sequences of their preregions and trailer polypeptides. Since the significance of the trailer sequence if any is unknown, it cannot be argued for the moment that the pre pro IGFs are yet another example of polyproteins 31 with more than one functional part.The translated rIGF II sequence is in agreement with the published protein sequence 12 , except that the first residue of the C domain is a Ser AGC , instead of a Gly GGX . The assignment of a Gly in this position seems unequivocal from the protein sequencing data, while the fact that the nucleotide sequence isAGC instead of GGC has been firmly demonstrated by sequencing four independent clones. We. feel that this excludes the possibility of reverse transcriptase errors. Thus, we do not know how to explain this difference, which is certainly not due to polymorphism, since the source of both the protein and the RNA was the same. We note that the residue in this position of the hIGF II sequence 8, 18, 22 is also a Ser.The calculated MW of the putative precursor is 19,968 daltons preregion 2,330, rIGF II 7,512, trailer 10, 126 . This size is consistent with a MW of 21 1 K reported from the results of in vitro translation of fractionated BRL 3A RNA 32 , which was designated as the 22 K precursor. However, there is a significant discrepancy between the size of the 3.4 kb mRNA we detect and the reported size 12 S of the translated fraction 32 . Moreover, not all of the expected sizes of the processing products of pre pro rIGF II, inferred from our sequencing data, correlate with the molecular species that have been observed in BRL 3A cells in vivo 33 .From the translated DNA sequence, one would simply predict that the signal peptide is eliminated first, yielding a pro protein of 17.6 K, which would then be processed to mature rIGF II by clipping of the trailer polypeptide. However, the 22 K in vitro precursor was not observed in vivo 33 , even after a brief 10 min 35 S Met pulse, while a 19 20 K species thought to represent the pro protein was the first detectable product. Also, an intermediate species of 16 K, and two smaller forms of 8.7 and 7.1 K, were detected in vivo. The latter two species were also present in the culture media Since the 7.1 K species is presumably the 7.5 K mature rIGF II, a possible interpretation of these observations is that the trailer polypeptide is not separated from the body of rIGFII in one step.This possibility is not unlikely because the trailer sequence contains one Lys Arg and twoArg Arg pairs, which are candidates for processing sites. If this scheme turns out to be correct, it would be of interest to examine the possible biological function of the small peptides that can be generated from the trailer. An alternative interpretation of these results 33 would be that the polyclonal antibody used in these studies recognizes also rIGF II related peptides.The DNA sequencing data we present are only in partial agreement with the data by Dull et al. 18 andWhitfield et al. 19 , who have also sequenced rIGF II cDNA clones derived from the same mRNA source. Our data for the coding region of pre pro IGF II are in complete agreement with the sequence of Dull et al. 18 , including the first codon of the C domain Ser instead of Gly . Thus, the accuracy of the sequence byWhitfield et al. 19 , which has differences in six codons, should be re examined. These authors presented the sequence of a partial cDNA clone, beginning with the last three codons of the C domain. They then extended this sequence upstream for another 35 codons by sequencing a primer extended cDNA. Thus, their total sequence begins with the third residue of the B domain, and differs from ours in the third position of codons 3, 10, 22, 32 and 45, and in the first position of codon 33 first codon of the C domain , which encodesGly instead of Ser.Our partial sequence of the 3 noncoding region covers 250 nt, and is in complete agreement with the longer sequence 392 nt by Whitfield et al 19 . The sequence by Dull et al. 18 is shorter in this region 134 nt . The last 16 nt of their sequence do not match our data, while the nucleotide at the fifth position upstream from this point is a T instead of a C probably due to a misreading of the chemical sequencing ladder because of the presence of an Eco RII site . The major discrepancy between our data and the sequence by Dull et al. 18 concerns the 5 noncoding region.With the exception of 9 nt upstream from the ATG initiator where these authors position an intron in the corresponding sequence o the hIGF II chromosomal gene , our sequence differs completely from theirs.The 5 noncoding region they present, derived from only one clone pMSA 52H9 , is 1055 nt long, which is incon slstent with the interpretation of our primer extension data Moreover, an analogous primer extension experiment by Whitfield et al. 19 yielded a size estimate for this region, which is much closer to ours.We believe that our sequence for the 5 noncoding region of the pre pro rIGF II mRNA is correct for the following reasons a Northern analysis indicates that this sequence is present in the 3.4 kb mRNA. b The sequence reported by Bell et al. 22 as the 5 noncoding region of hIGF II cDNA cannot be found in the hIGF II gene sequence presented by Dull et al. 18 , even though it can be aligned to our rIGF II 5 noncoding region sequence Fig. lc , despite the expected considerable degree of divergence.Transcripts Related to Pre Pro rIGF IISince our sequence for the 5 noncoding region of the pre pro rIGF II mRNA was derived exclusively from clone 27 Fig la , it was important to show that it did not correspond to a cloning artifact, but to a region of the 3.4 kb species. For this reason, we used as a probe a nick translated DNA fragment from clone 27, extending from the extreme 5 end of the available sequence Eco RI linker used for cloning to an Eco RII site at position 79 145 nt representing exclusively 5 noncoding region, Fig. Ia . Northern analysis ofBRL 3A RNA showed that this sequence is indeed part of the 3.4 kb mRNA. Surprisingly, however, a second 1.6 kb RNA species was hybridized.Thinking, after this result, that we might be dealing with a case of differential splicing, we rescreened the BRL 3A cDNA library with a 250 nt Eco RI Bam probe Fig. la , which contains the entire available 5 non coding region, and identified approximately 100 positive clones. Fifteen of these clones, selected at random, were first established as true positives by rescreening with the same probe they were then analyze by Southern blotting, using as probe clone 14 DNA, which carries rIGF II coding region Fig. la . Two of the clones 19f and 19b which did not hybridized to the clone 14 probe, were sequenced Fig. 2 .Clone 19f a partial cDNA has an insert of 400 nt, of which the last 51 nt are absolutely homologous to nucleotides 11 to 61 of our pre pro rIGF II sequence, while the sequence upstream from position 61 is totally different. The insert of clone l9b is shorter approximately 230 nt . It is also partial sequence beginning only one nucleotide upstream from the breaking point of clones 19f and 27. This nucleotide is a G as in the clone l9f sequence, but this does not. allow us to conclude that l9f and I9b are overlapping clones. The sequence of clone l9b is completely homologous to the pre pro rIGF II sequence between 61 to 53 which includes the first 18 codons of the preregion .The rest of the available sequence 73 nt extending in the 3 direction diverges from the sequence of pre pro rIGF II. To examine whether the sequence of clone l9f was part of the 1.6 kb RNA, we made a probe from this clone that excluded the 19f 27 overlap, and analyzed by Northern blotting BRL 3A RNA. The result was unexpected, because instead of the 1.6 kb RNA, another RNA species of 1.75 kb was hybridized. However, when the 250 nt EcoRI Bam probe from clone 27 was used as a probe, which includes the overlap of clones l9f, 19b and 27, not only the previously identified three RNA species 3.4, 1.75 and 1.6 kb were hybridized, but also a fourth species of 1.1 kb gave a positive signal.Hybridization to the Eco Ril Bam fragment of clone 27 shows that only three of the RNAs 3.4, 1.75 and 1.1 kb share this sequence, because the 1.6 kb species did not hybridize. Of the four related RNAs we detected, three 3.4, 1.75 and 1.6 kb are polyadenylated species. Thus, in addition to the 3.4 kb pre pro rIGF II mRNA, the 1.75 and 1.6 kb RNAs almost certainly also encode polypeptides. This cannot be claimed for the moment for the 1.1 kb species, because though its presence was detected in total cell RNA, we have not yet probed poly A RNA for this transcript.Northern analysis was performed on gel blots of totalRNA 50 ug per lane extracted from neonatal rat tissues of brain, heart, liver, lung, and muscle, or from adult c tissues adult liver, and adult muscle or from BRL 3A cells. The probe was uniformly labeled antimessage single stranded DNA corresponding to theEco RI Bam fragment of clone 27 see Fig. la .Two aliquots 50 1 g each of total BRL 3A cell RNA were electrophoresed in parallel and hybridized after transfer either to a uniformly labeled probe corresponding to the Eco Ril Bam fragment of clone 27 Fig. la or to a nick translated probe of the entire chromosomal clone hybridizing to rIGF II sequences see Materials and Methods and text . Another experiment concerned the electrophoresis and hybridization to 8 V g of poly A RNA from BRL cells and 50 ug each of total RNA from mouse fetal liver or adult liver. The probe was derived from clone 27 by limited synthesis and represented primarily trailer polypeptide sequence.In order to verify that the four related RNA species are not present exclusively in the transformed BRL 3A cell line, and in order to examine their possible developmental and tissue specificity, we hybridized totalRNA from rat neonatal day 2 rat tissues to the EcoRI Bam probe of clone 27. All of the neonatal day 2 rat tissues that were examined brain, heart, liver, lung and muscle contain all four transcripts, but in different amounts. The neonatal muscle contains in addition a hybridizing band of 1.85 kb that appears unique to this tissue . In contrast, the adult liver and muscle tissues contain only RNA in the region of the 1.75 1.6 kb doublet the two RNAs did not resolve well in this experiment .The developmental specificity of the 3.4 kb mRNA seems to be the same in the mouse, because d cross hybridizing 3.4 kb transcript is present in fetal, but not in adult, mouse liver RNA.The absence of the 3.4 kb mRNA from the adult tissues is consistent with previous data supporting the notion that IGF II is a fetal somatomedin see ref. 6 and other ref. therein . The differential expression of these transcripts in neonatal tissues is intriguing. Obviously muscle is the tissue with the highest concentration of the 3.4 kb and 1.1 kb species, while the 1.75 kb and 1.6 kb RNAs are under represented. The latter two species, however, predominate in brain and lung. It is interesting that the cardiac muscle has a profile distinct from that of skeletal muscle. It is also interesting that the hepatic BRL 3A cell line retains the profile of the four species as it appears in liver tissue.What is the source of these related RNA species The available data do not allow us to discriminate between expression of different genes sharing exons and differential splicing. However, differential polyadenyla tion seems to be excluded from the data . PreliminarySouthern analysis of rat chromosomal DNA yielded results compatible with the presence of a unique gene, when coding region of rIGF II was used as a probe.However, hybridization to the 250 nt Eco Rl Bam probe of clone 27 complicated the picture, because of the appearance of additional bands, which cannot be accounted for. Nevertheless, the identity of the overlapping sequence between clones 27 and 19f or 27 and l9b cannot be easily explained by the presence of two different genes, because at least some minor degree of divergence should have been evident. This issue more than one gene vs. differential splicing, or both will be resolved from the characterization of a corresponding chromosomal gene that we have isolated.Though it is still unknown whether the representation of the 3.4 kb mRNA on this clone is partial or complete, we note that a probe of the entire chromosomal clone about 13.2 kb insert, consisting of two Eco RI fragments of 10 and 3.2 kb hybridizes to all of the RNA species, with the exception of the 1.6 kb transcript, and in addition to a 3.0 kb RNA. This newly detected transcript might belong to the family or to a coordinately expressed, linked gene.The detection of a family of related transcripts suggests that our data and the data by Dull et al. 18 might eventually be reconciled. In this regard we note that a probe from clone 27, which primarily represents trailer polypeptide sequence, hybridizes not only to the 3.4 kb mRNA, but also to a 4.3 kb transcript.However, despite the suggestive size of this transcript, we have no data indicating homology to the 51 noncoding region of Dull et al. 18 . Nevertheless, we feel that differential splicing is the most likely explanation for the surprising and unprecedented observation by these authors that more then 1 kb of sequence, considered as 5 noncoding region, is 80 homologous between the human and rat IGF II clones.We note that both of these sequences contain long open reading frames, which have the potential to encode proline rich peptides with some striking, but limited, homologies to retroviral gag proteins . In addition, differential splicing is consistent with the presence of an open reading frame in the available 3 noncoding region of the pre pro rIGF II sequence. Alternatively, the 3.4 kb species might simply belong to a category of mRNAs with exceedingly long 3 noncoding regions, like, for example, the message encoding acetylcholine receptor 34 .Considering the questions generated from these data, we feel that it is premature to derive conclusions about the possible relationship between the IGF, insulin and relaxin genes, though the structure of the coding regions and the position of introns in the three gene types are not inconsistent with the postulated divergent rather than convergent mode of evolution 1, 18 . However, the most exciting prospect for the immedi ate future is the study of the developmental and tissue specific expression of the structurally related transcripts we observe, especially if they are also functionally related, and the response of the corresponding gene s to hormonal stimuli. In addition, it will be interesting to eventually examine whether the genes encoding IGFs or their receptors, or both, correspond to oncogenes, by analogy to the PDGF c sis andEGF receptor v erb relationships 35 37 .
