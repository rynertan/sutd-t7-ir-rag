DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT The mechanical equipment 10 of the screw compressorexpander cryogenic system is generally indicated in FIGS.1, 2 and 3. In FIG. 1 it is shown in association with the external gas flow equipment 12 which completes the cryogenic system and in FIG. 2 it is shown in association with the lubrication plumbing 14 which is external to the machinery 10. The machinery 10 comprises drive motor 16 which is usually an electric motor and is positioned within motor housing 18. Motor housing 18 is divided by wall 20 so that the motor bearings 2 2 and 24 in bearing bosses 26 and 28 are in separate lubrication compartments. End wall 30 serves as the end wall for compressor chamber 32 as well as a mounting boss for the compressor drive end bearings 34 and 36. Wall 38 through motor housing 18 separates the compressor drive end bearings 34 and 36 from motor drive end bearing 24 to provide separate compartments for these bearings. The other end of compressor chamber 32 is closed by end wall 38 which carries back end compressor bearings 40 and 42. Magnetic coupling compartment 44 is separated from magnetic coupling compartment 46 by thin magnetic wall 48. Magnetic coupling disc 50 is mounted on the end of the compressor shaft to rotate therewith. As it is seen in FIG. 3, the compressor shaft is coupled to the motor shaft so that the whole structure is driven by the motor. Magnetic coupling disc 52 faces disc 50 from compartment 46 so that magnetic coupling between the discs takes place through wall 48.Each of the discs is a multiple magnet arranged so that the magnets can couple together to transmit torque. Disc 52 is mounted on expander shaft 54 which extends out of expander compartment 56 on low thermal loss hollow shafts. The companion expander shaft 58 carries the mating expander rotor. The expander shafts are carried on bearings 60 and 62 in compartment 48 while the bearings 64 and 66 carry the other ends of the expander shafts in compartment 68, Each of the bearings is provided with a seal between the bearing and the adjacent compressor or expander chamber. The rotors are designed such that the gas dynamics in the space between the rotors holds them apart so that no timing gears are necessary to prevent mechanical contact between the rotors. By appropriate rotor design, an expander 70 expanding air from one atmosphere to 0.5 atmosphere while running at 10,000 rpm can operate without contact. In a test of that nature, the rotors were inspected after a one hour test and showed no contact or wear. As seen in FIG. 1, compressor 72 receives refrigerant gas at its right end through suction line 74 and compresses it within chamber 32 to deliver it in pressure line 76. As indicated above, suitable pressures are respectively G 5 atmospheres in the suction line 74 and one atmosphere in the pressure line 76. Suitable refrigerant gases depend on the desired temperature, but include nitrogen, argon, carbon dioxide, neon, helium and hydrogen. The gas selected and the line pressures depend on the desired end temperature. Jacket 78 carries a coolant which carries off some of the heat of compression while after cooler 80 brings the refrigerant fluid in the pressure line 76 almost down to the temperature of the coolant in coolant line 82. Counterflow heat exchanger 84 further cools the gas flowing in pressure line 76.From heat exchanger 84, the gas in pressure line 76 goes into the expander chamber 56 at the left end which is the high pressure end of expander 70.Rotation of the rotors in the expander chamber expand the gas into cold line 86 which is at the pressure of suction line 74. Heat load 88 adds heat to the gas while the heat load 88 is cooled. From the heat load 88 the gas passes through counter flow heat exchanger 84 and back to the suction line 74 of compressor 72. One of the specific improvements is the fact that there is a wall 48 between the compressor and expander, with power transferred between the compressor and expander through the magnetic coupling. Because of the partition wall and the magnetic coupling there is no flow of gas between the compressor housing and the expander housing and thus the pressure in the adjacent bearing compartment is equal to the adjacent gas pressure in the chamber in the housing. In other words, there is no pressure drop which would drive lubricant from the bearing into the compressor or expander chamber or which would drive refrigerant gas into the bearings to drive lubricant out of the bearings. In order to aid in bearing lubrication oil mist lubrication is provided. Radial blower 90, see FIG. 2 draws gas from compartment 68 together with the oil suspended in the gas and discharges it out line 92 where it is passed to compartment 44, see FIG. 3. From the top of compartment 44, line 94, carries the oil mist suspended in refrigerant gas back through compartment 68 to blower 90. When there is an oil mist of 1 to 5 per volume of bearing lubrication oil to refrigerant gas, the blower 90 maintains the oil in mist suspension as it passes through the lines and bearing compartments so that the bearings are continuously lubricated. The bearings 40, 42, 64 and 66 are lubricated by this circuit. From FIG. 1, it can be seen that the ends of the corresponding compressor and expander chambers adj cent these bearings are at the same pressure, the pressure of low pressure line 74 so that there is no pressure cnrop between the bearing compartment and the chambers so that the oil is not driven one way or another. Lubricant blower 96 is driven by the idler rotor in compressor 72. It draws refrigerant gas and suspended oil mist from the compartment of bearings 34 and 36 and delivers it through line 97 to compartment 46 where it, serves to lubricate bearings 60 and 62. From that compartment, the mist is conveyed through line 98 to lubricate the bearing 22 and thence through line 100 to lubricate the other motor bearing 24. From thence, line 102 conveys the mist back to the compartment adjacent bearings 34 and 36 from whence it is drawn back into the blower 96 to continue its continuous closed cycle.The continuous closed cycle from blower 96 distributes lubricant through bearing compartments which are the same pressure as the adjacent gas of in this case 1 atmosphere so there is no differential pressure across the bearings from adjacent compartments, This reduces load on the bearing seals. Another preferred embodiment of the screw compressor expander cryogenic system of this invention is generally indicated at 104 in FIG. 4. It comprises a motor 106 which drives compressor 108 which has rotors 110 and 112 of the type previously described.The rotor 110 is driven directly by motor 106 and rotor 112 is preferably driven by gas film between the lobes and recesses on the rotors so that no mechanical contact takes place. The bearings of the motor, compressor and the expanders may be lubricated by a circulating mist as described above. Magnetic coupling plates 114 and 116 operate through thin wall 118 so that power is interchanged between compressor 108 and expander 120.Expander 120 has rotors 122 and 124 which are preferably separated by the hydrodynamic gas film. Expander 120 is coupled to expander 126 by means of magnetic coupling plates 128 and 130 which operate through wall 132.Expander rotors 134 and 136 expand gas in the chambers defined by the lobes and recesses on the rotors and again the rotor 136 is preferably separated from rotor 134 by a hydrodynamic gas film so that no mechanical connection is necesssary. All bearings are preferably lubricated by mist lubrication in ordea to provide a long life, and the mist lubrication circuits are defined in such a manner that bearings at the same pressure are connected together on the same mist lobrication circuit and the bearings at different pressure are on separate mist lubrication circuits. The cryogenic system could be arranged with the compressor 108 and expanders 120 and 126 to provide two temperature levels of refrigeration by employing suitable counterflow heat exchanges between the various flow streams. However, the screw compressor expander cryogenic refrigeration system illustrated in FIG. 4 is equipped with valves to permit its use with regenerator systems. Valve structure 140 is illustrative of valve structures 142 and 144 which are of similar design, with the details of valve structure 140 illustrated inFIGS. 5 and 6. Valve disc 146 is rotated by shaft 148 which is the shaft of rotor 124. Openings 150 and 152 are formed through disc 146 and are illustrated as being approximately half circular. They are positioned to cover and uncover valve ports 154 and 156 respectively.When cryogenic gas under pressure is provided in chamber 158 then the gas is alternately ported to the lines connected to valve ports 154 and 156. The configuration of openings 150 and 152 depends on the gas, the rotative speed and the pressure, and the ports may be overlapped or underlapped depending on particular conditions. As illustrated in FIG. 6, they are slightly underlapped. The ports 154 and 156 with their corresponding openings are in effect separate valves which open at approximately opposite times. For convenience in the schematic diagram of FIG. 7 wherein the system incorporating regenerators as generally indicated at 160, for the convenience of schematic showing, the valving is separately shown. Similar valve ports 162 and 164 are shown in connection with compressor 108 and valve ports 166 and 168 are shown in connection with expander 126. As the compressor and expanders rotate the valves open and close to reverse flow in much of the system 160. In FIG. 7 flow arrows are shown in connection with one position of the valving, and it is understood that with a half turn of the valve discs, some of the flows are reversed. The direction of flow and the reversing flow will be discussed in connection with the following description of the schematic of FIG. 7 of the system 160.In considering the system, the flow arrows shown in FIG. 7 are for one portion of the flow cycle, In accordance with the usual regenerator practice, the valves are alternately operable so that flow direction through the regenerators reverses from time to time. At the time illustrated, compressor 108 takes suction of refrigerant gas, compresses the gas and delivers it through heat exchanger 170 where heat is rejected to the ambient. Gas flow passes through open valve 162 and downward into the top of regenerator 172 which is about 300 K. The down flowing gas is cooled by the previously cooled regenerator packing. Part of the downward flow is taken out through line 174 where it enters expander 120 and is expanded therein.The expanded gas passes out through open valve 156 and is in surface heat exchange with the body of regenerator 176 at heat exchanger 178. This heat exchange is to stabilize the temperature.From heat exchanger 178, the fluid flow passes through heat exchanger 180 which provides refrigeration load at about 800K. From the heat exchanger load, the fluid passes into regenerator 176 to rise therein. Another portion of the downflowing cryogenic refrigerator gas stream in regenerator 172 is taken out of the regenerator at line 182 where it passes into the high pressure end of the second stage expander 126. After it is expanded therein it passes out through valve 168 and then through load heat exchanger 184 which is at about 400K. From load heat exchanger the cryogenic refrigerant gas is delivered to the bottom of regenerator 176 and it is moved upwardly therethrough joining the stream from load heat exchanger 180 to absorb heat from the regenerator packing. At the top of the regenerator the cryogenic fluid passes through line 186 and back to the suction of compressor 108. At the next portion of the cycle, the valves 162, 156 and 168 close while the valves 164, 154 and 166 open to reverse the flow through the regenerators.By using a regenerator system, rather than a counterflow heat exchanger system, greater refrigeration efficiencies can be achieved.
