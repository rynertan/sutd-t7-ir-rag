# Television camera.

## Abstract
A television camera for colour television comprises several pick up tubes T1, T2, T3 which are arranged substantially horizontally or vertically in the camera. The pick up tubes T each have a mu metal shield mu1 against magnetism. Each substantially vertically arranged pick up tube T2, T3 has an additional second mu metal shield mu2, mu2 , which is absent for the horizontally arranged tube. The second shield may be in the form of a single plate mu2 overlapping the pick up tube or two plates mu2, mu2 arranged on both sides of the pick up tube and overlapping the tube. Deflection errors, especially in the corners of the television pictures caused by magnetic fields, are reduced to acceptable values.
