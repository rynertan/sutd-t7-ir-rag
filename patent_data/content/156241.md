## Description
The present invention relates to a solid state electrolytic battery composed of an activated solid state cathode material, a solid state electrolytic material, and an activated solid state anode material. As a result of the recent development of semiconductor element processing technology and the associated application technology, a variety of electronic apparatuses have helped to gradually decrease power consumption. At the same time, reflecting the tendency towards decreased power consumption, there is a growing demand to realize still smaller and thinner battery configurations for use in modern electronic apparatuses. There is also a strong demand to increase battery reliability. Solid state electrolytic batteries show the promise of satisfying these requirements. Basically, the solid state electrolytic battery uses a solid state electrolyte containing an ionized conductive material. Thus, the electrolyte never leaks from the battery, so that even highly automated semiconductor element processing technology can also be applied. This is a great advantage in realizing the mass production of solid state electrolytic batteries. In fact, solid state electrolytic batteries incorporating either an ionized silver conductive element, an ionized copper conductive element, or an ionized lithium conductive element have already been developed. Of these, the batteries using either an ionized silver conductive element or an ionized copper conductive element offer a relatively strong ionic conductivity in the solid state electrolyte. Thus, a large amount of current can be discharged. Conversely, solid state electrolytic batteries using an ionized lithium conductive element provide high density energy storage and allow a high voltage output. Nevertheless, since the solid state electrolyte available for the ionized lithium conductive element is not sufficiently conductive, such batteries cannot discharge a large amount of current. In addition, since lithium itself absorbs a large amount of moisture, an extremely skilled technique is required to properly seal such batteries. This involves a complex production process while the battery itself requires a large volume as well. These disadvantages ultimately make it difficult to realize a smaller, thinner design which should be one of the advantageous features of solid state electrolytic batteries. Solid state electrolytic batteries containing either ionized silver, ionized copper, or ionized lithium electrolyte cause the conductive materials to precipitate themselves in branches as the charge is reduced. This adversely affects the services life and restricts the durable discharge. As a result, such obviously defective solid state electrolytic batteries have not yet been marketed. DE A 2 755 797 discloses a hydrogen cation conducting composition preferably for the use as a separator for electrical devices for example in batteries and electrochromic cells. The battery system therein described is of a solid state system comprising a Cu PdH In light of the circumstances thus described, the present invention aims to realize a highly reliable and durable solid state electrolytic battery incorporating a hydrogen storing alloy. This battery should be capable of discharging a large amount of current and maintaining a very satisfactory charge discharge cycle. The invention relates to a solid state electrolytic battery comprising a cathode made of an activated hydrogen storing alloy, a solid state electrolyte made of hydrogen ion conductive elements and an anode containing hydrogen ions as guest material, which is characterized in that It is well known that hydrogen in vapor form can be stored in a hydrogen storing alloy at a specific temperature and pressure so as to co exist with the alloy. The hydrogen storing alloy storing the hydrogen in the hydrogenated metal can discharge hydrogen in vapor form by varying the temperature and pressure at specific levels. In addition, it has also been proposed to electrochemically apply the hydrogen storing alloy to the cathode of an alkali battery having an alkaline solution as the electrolyte. The present invention provides an entirely new solid state electrolytic battery incorporating a hydrogen storing alloy as the cathode, a solid state electrolyte activating protons as the conductive ion, and an anode comprised of a material containing hydrogen as a guest element. When the anode is composed of such a material that can reverse feed hydrogen as guest material, the solid state electrolytic battery embodied by the present invention can be repeatedly charged and discharged as required. Since the activated hydrogen storing alloy is used in the cathode, the electrode causes the diffused hydrogen to take part in the reaction, thus effectively preventing the precipitation of the reduced conductive material in branches otherwise caused by repeated charge discharge cycles when using conventional precipitation type electrodes that apply a metallic ion for the conductive elements. Thus an extremely durable charge discharge life results. The solid state electrolytic battery of the present invention features the following advantages. Neither the hydrogen storing alloy of the cathode nor the solid state electrolyte nor the activated materials of the anode absorbs moisture, thus stabilizing the battery s atmosphere. Since all battery constituents are in solid state, the battery can easily be sealed. Yet such solid state electrolytes can be used to build extremely thin units or to create multiple layers, thus eventually providing a greater industrial potential than any conventional battery. The hydrogen storing alloy for use as the cathode is comprised of hydrogenated alloys of LaNi₅, CaNi₅, TiFe, TiNi and TiNiMn. Amorphous and or crystalline material is used as the solid state in terms of phosphotungstate hydrate P₂O₅ 24WO₃ 29H₂O , stannic oxide SnO₂ nH₂O , antimonypentaoxide Sb₂O₅ nH₂O , uranyl phosphate HUO₂PO₄ 4H₂O , zirconium oxide ZrO₂ nH₂O or aluminosilicate. In addition, to these, the following materials that accept hydrogen being suitable as anode materials may be used TiS₂, NbS₂, TiS₃ NbS₃, WO₃, Cr₃O₈, MnO₂, MoO₂, VS₂, CrO₂. By adequately combining the variety of conditions needed for the cathode, electrolyte, and the anode, both the output voltage and the current can be controlled. Figure 1 shows a simplified diagram of the solid state electrolytic battery incorporating the preferred embodiment of the present invention. In Figure 1, reference number 1 indicates the cathode comprised of the hydrogen storing material, 2 indicates the solid state electrolyte provided with hydrogen ionic conductivity and 3 indicates the anode comprised of a material capable of internally accommodating hydrogen as a guest material. The cathode 1 and the opposite anode 3 are connected through the conductive material 4 , thus causing the hydrogen stored in the hydrogen storing material to start reacting in the manner indicated by the following formula so that hydrogen ions are released into the solid state electrolyte. The hydrogen ions released according to formula 1 proceed in the direction of the anode via the solid state electrolyte. On arrival at the anode, the hydrogen ions cause the following reaction to occur, thus absoring hydrogen. However, the present invention does not define whether such water hydrating said hydrogen ions is comprised of crystal water in the solid state electrolyte or of free water contained in the solid state electrolyte. The present invention also does not define whether such hydrogen absorbed as a guest material is perfectly topo chemical, or whether it is accompanied by a structural variation of the host material or a state close to that of the compound. Even when the discharge reactions take place according to formulae 1 and 2 or 1 and 2 , the battery s over all reaction during discharge is as shown in the formula below Note that the reverse reaction takes place during charge. A typical procedure for manufacturing the hydrogen storing alloy is described below. First, titanium having a purity of at least 99.5 and nickel having a purity of at least 99.5 are blended in an atomic ratio of 1 1. Then, this blend is inserted into an arc furnace wherein a vacuum of 1.3 10 ⁴ to 1.3 10 ⁵ mbar 10 ⁴ or 10 ⁵ Torr is created. Then an argon gas atmosphere is produced whereafter the blend is molten in the arc furnace to dissolve the components. The blend is agitated several times to obtain a homogenous blend. The dissolution is repeated several times to make up the alloy. After completing the dissolution the specimen is extracted and crushed to pieces having a diameter of several millimeters. These pieces are introduced into a high pressure stainless steel container and the air is extracted to create a vacuum of 1.3 10 ² mbar 10 ² Torr . Then hydrogen gas is introduced into the container to raise the pressure up to 30 bars, whereafter the contents is heated up to 250 C. Then, the material is left for about 2 hours before cooling it to room temperature. The hydrogen gas is released and the container is again evacuated. Again hydrogen gas is fed into the container up to a pressure of 30 bar, thereby to cause the TiNi alloy to absorb hydrogen. This completes the hydrogenation of the TiNi alloy. If the test result is unsatisfactory, the entire procedure described above is repeated. Next, using an agate mortar, the hydrogenated TiNi alloy is crushed in a glove box comprising an argon gas atmosphere to obtain crushed powder particles having a diameter of less than 44 microns. To 0.1 gram of said particles, 0.01 gram of conductive carbon are added. Finally, pellets are formed using a pelletizer. Next, 99.99 pure antimony pentaoxide is mixed with pure water and stirred well. The mixture is dried at room temperature. 0.1 gram of the dried powder is formed to pellets using the pelletizer. If the mixture of antimony pentaoxide and water still does not provide proton conductivity, antimony pentachloride is introduced into pure water to generate a white precipitate, which is rinsed, dried and used. Next, manganese dioxide is prepared in the conventional manner and crushed to obtain a powder. 0.01 gram of the conductive carbon powder is then added to 0.1 gram of the crushed powder obtained. Finally, pellets are formed using the pelletizer. To provide the solid state electrolytic battery a cathode composed of TiNiH Figure 3 shows the first charge discharge cycle characteristics, whereas figure 4 shows the 50th charge discharge cycle characteristics. By these tests, it is confirmed that the solid state electrolytic battery according to the present invention can be repeatedly charged and discharged. Likewise, when using as the activated anode materials WO₃ or TiS₂, the same satisfactory results as above were obtained. When such unique solid state electrolytic batteries are completed, they are provided with a specific range of open potentials according to the amount of moisture stored in the activated anode material as the structural content, the blended amount of the conductive materials, and the hydrogen content stored in the activated cathode materials. For example, after testing a number of these solid state electrolytic batteries composed of TiNiH According to a still further preferred embodiment of the present invention, special batteries are manufactured which contain anodes made of MnO₂, cathodes made of TiNiMn As is clear from the above description, the unique solid state electrolytic battery embodied by the present invention effectively uses an activated hydrogen storing alloy for the cathode, a solid state hydrogen ion conductive electrolyte, and anode materials, that absorb hydrogen as a guest. This battery has proven to be significantly useful in providing great potential advantages for all industries today.
