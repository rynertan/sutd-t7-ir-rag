# Oscillator circuit.

## Abstract
An oscillator circuit in a semiconductor substrate 7 for an integrated circuit includes a gain correction circuit 4 connected between the output terminal of a feedback circuit 2 and the input end of an amplifier circuit 1 composed of MOS transistors 11, 12 . The gain correction circuit 4 suppresses the excessive amplitude of the output signal of the feedback circuit 2 so that the characteristic of the waveform of the output signal of the oscillator device is improved.
