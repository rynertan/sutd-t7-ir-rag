# SOOTBLOWING OPERATION WITH IDENTIFICATION OF MODEL PARAMETERS

## Abstract
A method of identifying a parameter of a model for a rate of loss of boiler efficiency due to a sootblowing operation, in a boiler having a plurality of heat traps, comprises measur ing a time since a last sootblowing operation in the heat trap in question, measuring an overall boiler efficiency at the beginning of sootblowing for the heat trap in question, measuring a change in efficiency due to the sootblowing operation and calculating the parameter using an equation. According to the equation, the ratio of efficiency change over overall boiler efficiency equals the time factor since the last sootblowing operation times the parameter minus a summa tion of factors for each of the other heat traps and their associated sootblowing operations. The technique is extend able to individual sootblowers within a heat trap by using fouling rate index rather than overall boiler efficiency.
