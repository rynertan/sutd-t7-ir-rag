# Phase locked loop, particularly for use in a directly mixing synchronous AM receiver.

## Abstract
A phase locked loop comprising a controllable oscillator TO which is phase coupled through a phase detection ar rangement M1, M2, M3 and a low pass filter LP to an input carrier applied to a signal input of the phase detection arrange ment. In order to increase the phase synchronization between a carrier locally generated in the loop and an input carrier, the unwanted DC offset, which is caused during phase detection is reduced. To this end the phase detection arrangement of the loop is provided with first M1 , second M2 and third M3 mixer stages which are mutually coupled in succession, whilst an auxiliary mixing signal is applied from a signal generator SS to the first and third mixer stages, an input of one of the first and second mixer stages being coupled to the signal input of the phase detection arrangement and an input of the other of the two last mentioned stages being coupled to an output of the controllable oscillator, said low pass filter having a cut off fre quency which is lower than the fundamental frequency of the said auxiliary mixing signal, said fundamental frequency being lower than the frequency of the input carrier. To increase the dynamic range of a directly mixing syn chronous AM receiver, this phase locked loop is used therein for generating a synchronous RF carrier. To this end the signal input of the phase locked loop is connected to the RF input of the directly mixing synchronous AM receiver, and the controll able oscillator functions as a tuning oscillator and is coupled to the said carrier input of the synchronous AM detector, the fun damental frequency of the auxiliary mixing signal being lower than the highest modulation frequency in the RF AM receiver signal.
