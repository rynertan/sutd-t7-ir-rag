# Electrical devices including electrode bearing amorphous solid material.

## Abstract
Amorphous niobates and tantalates of the alkali metals lithium, potassium, and sodium which may be off stoichiometric with regard to the related octahedrally coordinated crystalline compositions manifest high values of dielectric constant and ionic conductivity. Electrode bearing devices may be utilized, inter alia, as capacitors, electrolytic cells, and bolometers.
