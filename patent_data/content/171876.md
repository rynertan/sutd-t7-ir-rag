# Torsional axial extensiometer with additional restraint to limit unnecessary movements.

## Abstract
An extensometer assembly measures axial strain, tor sional strain, and various combinations of these strains in a specimen 13 on which the extensometer is mounted, through the use of two extensometers 11, 12 on opposite sides of the specimen coupled by a cross beam 14, 15 . Connecting assemblies 16,17 are used to eliminate flexibil ity in unneeded axes to thereby minimize the opportunities for unwanted signals to occur. The mounting frame 15 is stiff in all axes which are not necessary for measurements. The frame is soft in necessary axes for operation.
