# ANGULAR RATE SENSOR

## Abstract
An improved system for operating an angular rate sensor is disclosed which reduces substantially the lock in rate value of the sensor and at the same time improves random drift error. This may be achieved by using a tiltable mirror 410 in the optical closed loop path of the sensor and by controlling the tilt angle due to a signal derived from the behaviour of one or both of the sensor s counter propagating waves
