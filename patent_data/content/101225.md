# DATA IDENTIFICATION METHOD FOR ELASTOMERIC PRODUCTS

## Abstract
An elastomeric product is provided with at least one local magnetizeable area formed by incorporating therein a powdery magnetizeable material during the manufacture of the product. Identification data is magnetically recorded in the magnetizeable area or areas thus produced. The powdery magnetizeable material may be incorpo rated in the elastomeric product either by blending it with the other components from which the elastomeric product is manufactured or by incorporating it in a rubber sheet which is formed into an integral part of the elastomeric product during the manufacture thereof.
