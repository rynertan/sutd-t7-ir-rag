# Video camera apparatus.

## Abstract
A video camera apparatus of the present invention has a special switch circuit which, when an electronic view finder with a stereo microphone is mounted on a video camera main body in a reverse posture, electrically reverses the top bot tom portions of picture information of a video signal supplied to the electronic view finder and also exchanges the L and R information of stereophonic signals supplied to a stereo reco rding apparatus. The signal selection of stereophonic signals from the stereo microphone and that of top bottom reversed and top bottom nonreversed video signals from a video camera main body are respectively changed in accordance with the mounting posture of the electronic view finder. Ther efore, a proper stereophonic recording can be effected both in the normal and reverse posture photographing.
