# HEAD ARM AND CONTROL SYSTEM THEREFOR

## Abstract
A head arm 25 includes a pick up head 18 at one end 22 and a pivot 24 for mounting the arm to a base 12 at a pivot position remote from the one end and spaced from an opposite end 28 with a drive 26 coupled to the arm in the area between the pivot and the opposite end for pivoting the arm to position the pick up head with respect to a data disk 15 . Preferably, the drive is a linear motor having a stator coil 70 embedded in the pick up arm and field producing magnets 71, 73, 76, 78 mounted to the base. Preferably, also, there is a velocity pick up coil 72 positioned to detect arm movement and provide, in connection with signals applied to the linear motor, synthesized linear velocity control signals employed for the controlling of the arm position. The arm preferably comprises upper 30 and lower 32 apertured members connected along their outer edges 31 by bridge members 35 .
