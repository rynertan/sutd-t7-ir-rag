# Improvements in or relating to the processing of radiation sensitive devices.

## Abstract
Changes occurring in the electrical conductivity of liquids used to process image wise exposed radiation sensitive devi ces are used as a measure of the deterioration in effectiveness of the liquids. This deterioration is compensated for by varying the processing conditions, such as temperature, time, scrub bing action and processing liquid composition, in accordance with the change in conductivity.
