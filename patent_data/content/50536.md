# Fluid pressure braking system for an articulated vehicle.

## Abstract
A fluid pressure braking system for an articulated vehi cle having a towed unit and a towing unit includes a source of fluid pressure carried on the towing unit and a supply line 58 and a service line 62 which communicate the braking system on the towing unit with the braking system on the towed unit. A first proportioning valve 76 controls com munication to the relay valve 84 which controls communi cation of braking pressure to the rear wheel service brakes on the towing unit. The proportioning valve 76 is control led by an inversion valve 90 which is responsive to the pressure leval in the supply line 58 . When the pressure level in the supply line 58 is below a predetermined level indicating that the towing unit has been disconnected from the towed unit, the inversion valve 90 causes the propor tioning valve 76 to proportion communication to the relay valve 84 . A second proportioning valve 28 controls com munication to the front wheel brakes of the towing unit and is responsive to the signal from the inversion valve 90 to proportion communication to the front wheel brakes when the towing unit is connected to the towed unit but which permits an uninhibited communication to the front wheel brakes when the towed unit is disconnected from the towing unit. A third proportioning valve 24 controls communica tion through the service line 62 and is responsive to an operator actuated control valve 68 to provide proportioned brake applications on the trailer service brakes when the trailer is lightly loaded. A synchronizing valve 40 is respon sive to the magnitude of the brake application to reset the operator actuator valve 68 when higher pressures are generated, indicating that the towed and towing units have been recoupled.
