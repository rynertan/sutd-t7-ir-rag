# APPARATUS FOR BILLET SURFACE INSPECTION

## Abstract
The invention concerns apparatus for inspecting the flat surfaces of a metal billet and includes a carriage mounted scanning head having a high frequency eddy current probe 21 mounted on the periphery of a disc 18 rotatable above the billet surface about an axis perpendicular to said surface. The carriage 1 is located in abroad of the rotating scanning head. The eddy current probe is connected to transmit electri cal signals representative of the condition of the billet surface under inspection to signal processing equipment remote from the apparatus.
