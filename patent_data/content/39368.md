# REDUCTION GEAR SHIFTING DEVICE.

## Abstract
This reduction gear shifting device is employed in shifting the working speed of an agricultural tractor and is adapted to shift, in a simple manner, between a certain set rotational speed and reduced rotational speed slightly lower than the set speed. According to this device, the sun gear 30b of a planetary gear mechanism is either coupled to an output shaft 12 or rendered stationary via a clutch 41 and a brake 42 provided at the axial side of an inter nal gear 7a . A supporting frame 17 for journaling the shaft 12 internally accommodates the clutch 41 and the brake 42 together with the internal gear 7a to thereby install them at the front transmission case 3 . The clutch 41 and the brake 42 are of a frictional multi disk type in which at least one frictional plate 33 in one member is connected to at least one in the other member so as to move in the same direction. The brake 42 is so adapted that the supporting frame 17 serves as a statio nary side member. The piston 40 for operating the clutch 41 and the brake 42 is movably fitted over a collar 36 fitted over the outside of a center boss 30c of a housing 30 incorporating the sun gear 30b .

## Description
SPECIFICATIONSTitle of InventionDecelerating changeover equipmentTechnical fieldThis invention is concerned with the decelerating changeover equipment for easier performance of mutual changeover of transmission on the decelerating rotation speed for the speed already established, for instance, it is concenred with the decelerating changeover equipment suitable for use in the running transmission mechanism or power taken out transmission mechanism in transmissioncase of the tractor for agricultural uses. Beckground technologyIn agricultural tractors, for example, when cultivation is done in the use of rotary, the cultivating resistance is changed by the quality of the cultivating ground, that is, coking degree, granularity, etc. Such alterations of cultivating resistance during cultivation will give some pulsating or shocking loads to the tractor and rotaries on those parts, thus reducing the durability and operative performances.It is, therefore, desirable to control the cultivating speed, such as tracting running speed of the agricultural tractor or cultivating rotation speed of the rotary, without changing the cultivating depth. As the countermeasure, it is desirable to control the cultivating speed wit i out changing the cultivating depth, e.g., traction runnrng speed of agricultural tractor or cultivating raising rotation speed of the rotary.A well known structure is that for changeover of transmissiongear in the gear line for prompt and easy changeover.However, such a changeover of the clutch by sliding of transmission gear needs the structure necessary for temporary intermission of the rotation poser by the clutch or complicated gear mechanism by sirnuitaneous clutch, thus there is either problem of complicated changeover operation or that of the complicated structure.Such a transmission changeover equipment can be easily mounted on the agricultural tractors in accordance with the specifications by the size and types, and the confirmation of the operation can be easily done in its structures as desirable with the smaller size. Thus the transmission cbange over equipment of this invention is fulfilling these requirements.DISCLOSURE OF the INVENTION In this invention, the internal toothed gear driven for the rotation by the motor, the polfer asial part mounted pivotally in its free rotation for the planetary gear clutched with the said internal toothed gear, solar gear clutched with the said planetary gear on the same axis, and the output axial part mounted on the lateral side of the axial direction of the said internal toothed gear, are unified in one body with the said solar gear. Otherwise, it is composed of the clutch part detachable from the solar gear and the brake part being able to stop or rotatable of the said solar gear, and also, the output axial part with the connecting state of clutch part is unified with the solar gear, while the brake part is maintained rotatable of the solar gear, thereby, the internal toothed gear and the output axial part are unified.in one body, and rotationpower of the internal gear is transmitted to the outputaxial part under the directly coupled state without speedchange, thus the agricultural tractor runs for cultivating operation at the desired set speed by the major transmitting gear line and sub transmitting gear line mounted each on the front and rear position of this decelerating changeoverequipment.On the other hand, some deceleration of the rotation speed of the output axial part is obtained against the said set speed by stopping the solar gear by the operation of the brake part after detaching the solar gear from the outputaxial part by setting the clutch part off state. That is, the speed ratio is Number of teeth in the internal gear N N Number of teeth of solar gear Accordingly, by setting the number of teeth of the internal toothed gear more numerously than that of the solar gear, a little decelerated rotation speed against that of the internal toothed gear can be obtained from the output axial part.Then, for instance, when the cultivating resistance during the operation for cultivation by the set speed as in the above is felt, the clutch part is put to OFF for changingover to the operating state, the running cultivation speed of the agricultural tractor is a little reduced, and it is possible to correspond to the increase of cultivating resistanoe promptly, also, there is no necessity to make troublesome operation of ON and OFF of the transmission gear in the above changeover operation.In this invention, these clutch part and brake part are both equipped at the side of the axial direction of the internal toothed gear, thus the external shape of the clutch part and brake j,art can be formed into nearly the equal cylindrical type of the same diameter. The decelerating equipment c nsisting of these parts can be equipped in smaller size within the small hollow cylindrical supporting frame of the surrounding external shape.The equipment of this invention supports the output axial part axially, and this supporting frame is internally equipped with the above internal gears clutch part and brake part, moreover, this supporting frame is composed to act as the member of resting side of the brake part, thus on the occasion of assembling work of the equipment of this invention, by mounting the supporting frame equipped previously with the internal gears, it is possible to operate the equipment of this invention by transmitting the pressure fluid to the clutch part or brake part from the changeover valve and liquid transmitting tube mounted on the side of front mission side, thereby, before the assembling o peration of rear mission case, the equipment of this invention can be trially operated for confirmation and test on the directly connected driving or decelerating rotation.Furthermore, this supporting frame is formed to be able to mount or dismount the front transmission case to the wall part, thus before mounting to this front transmission case, by incorporating the output axial part, clutch part and brake part in the frame of the support, thereby, this supporting frame can be mounted on the front transmission case. Thereby, the previously assembled operation makes the centering action easier. Moreover, the clutch part and brake part of this invention is constructed with multiplates system pushing the plural friction plates to make the pushing pistion by the load of pressure liquid movable towards the same axial line, and these frictional plates are mutually connected to the connecting pin to be able to move each friction plate of the clutch part and brake part pushed direction by each piston as one body, thereby, when the clutch part is in the connecting state, the friction plate of the brake part separates one another surely, thus no brake acts on the solar gears, then the internal gears show the directly connected state with the output axial part exactly. Reversely, when the brake part is in the state of brake operation, friction plates at clutch part separate each other certainly, thus the solar gear is changed over to the fixed state, the the decele rating operation at the output axial part is surely performed. Moreover, in this invention, the solar gears are mounted on the cylindrical axial part of the housing equipped with the fluid transporting route towards each piston. While these pistons are externally set for free axial movement towards the collar set to the central boss part of the cylindrical axial part, Thereby, the external diameter of the central boss part in the housing becomes smaller by the thickness of the diameter direction of the collar, thus as illustrated in Fig. 5, on the drilling occasion of fluid transporting route 30h 3Oi towards the central boos part 30c in the manufacturing process of the housing, there is no hindrance for the drilling on the side of the axial direction of the surrounding cylinder part 30e . For the reference, Fig. 6 shows the drilling state of the fluidtransporting routes 47a 47b in the case of the housing without using the collar as in this invention.In this housing 47 , the diameter of the central boes part 47c became larger by the amount of the thickness of the diameterdirection of the above mentioned collar, thereby, the axial directional side of the surrounding cylinder 47d of the housing 47 becomes a hindrance, and the drill 48 cannot be used.Brief explanation of invention with drawings Fig. 1 shows the diagram of the power transmitting route of the agricultural tractor applicable for this invention.Fig. 2 shows the sectional view of the favorable decelerating change over equipment concerned with this invention.Fig. 3 shows the enlarged diagram of the main part of Fig. 2. Fig. 4 b c shows the perspective view of the friction plate used at the clutch part and brake part.Fig. 5 shows the hole opening state of the fluid transporting port of the housing in Fig. 4 a .Fig. 6 shows each sectional view of the hole opened state of the fluid transporting port of the housing without using the collar.Best state for PerfoTmine this invention For detailed explanation of this invention, favorable embodiments adapted for this agricultural tranctor will be explained in the attached drawings.Fig. 1 shows the power transmitting routes of the transmissin case of the agricultural tractor adapting the decelerating change over equipment in a favorable state concerned with this invention.The rotation of the crank shaft 2 due to the motor 1 is transmitted to the input asis 4 supported axially to the front transmission case through the main clutch 5 , and also, it is composed to be able to obtain the desired rotation speed from the major change gear shaft 7 by the major change gear line 8 mounted each on the major change gear shaft 7 and PTO shaft 6 supported to the front transmission case 3 . Accordingly, the decelerating changeover equipment 9 concerned with this invention is mounted in the rear transmission case 11 supported axially with the rear wheeel 10 of the agricultural tractor, and the rotation power transmitted to the output axial portion 9 from the major change gear shaft 7 is output under the directly connected state to this decelerating chanDeover equipment 9 , or it is mounted to make output on the output axial portion 12 at a little reduced speed for the rotation against the rotation speed at the directly connected transmission.With the subchange gear line 1 mounted each on FTP axis 6 and sub change gear shaft 14 supported axially to the rear transmission case 11 to rotate and drive the rear wheel driving gear portion 13 of the agricultural tractor, the rotation power from the output shaft protion 12 is transmitted to the subchange gear shaft 14 with chan e ear. The major part of the above power transmitting routes is shorn in Fig. 2 as a longitudinal section diagram.Fig. 5 illustrates the detailed longitudinal section diagram of the change gear equipment of this invention in detail.The follolfing is the detailed explanation on this mechanism. That is, the internal toothed gear 7a is equipped to the rear part of the major change gear axis 7 supported axially to the front transmission case 3 at the bearing 16 , and the terminal lid 18 is fixed with the bolt 19 to one end of the supporting frame 17 of the hollow cylinder opened on both ends. then this supporting frame 17 is mounted with bolt 20 to the wall part 3a of the front transmission case 3 , and the front end of the output axial part 1o equipped with the teeth part 12a at the rear part is supported axially to the rear part of the major change gear axis 7 through the bearing 21 mounted to the end lid 18 . Flange part 23b equipped with the space 23a and the carrier 23 equipped with the spliced boss like convex strip 3c e3c .... around the hollow cylinder are fit in to the spline 24 at the front of the output axial part 12 , and in the manner penetrating this space 23a , the pin 25 inserted to the flange part 23o is fixed with the tap plate 25 and bolt 27 , and the planetary gears 29 29 ... fit in freely rotatably to each pin 25 within the space 23a rotatably freely through the bearing 28 are interlocked within the internal toothed gear 7a . Fig. 4 a shows the perspective view, and Fig. 6 illustrates the longitudinal section, in which, solar gear 30b is equipped at the front of the cylindrical axial part 30a of the hollow cylinder, and a thick central boss part 30c is formed around the center of this cylindrical axial part 30a , also the disklike compartment 30d is projected surroundingly from the central boss part 30c , and the surrounding cylindrical part 30e is extendedly mounted in front and in rear towards the cylindrical center from the surrounding if this compartment 30d , while the housing 30 is formed by taking the parallel grooves 30f 30f and and 30g 39g in the cylindrical length at the front and the rear of the cylindrical longitudinal direction of the surrounding cylindrical part 30e . The cylinder axial part 30a is rotatably and freely fit outside to the output axial part 12 through the bearing 31 , and the solar gear 30b is interlocked with the planetary gears 29 29 thereby, the carrier is inserted into the supporting frame 17 , and also, the convex strip 23c ... of the carrier 23 is formed to be positioned inside of the internal surrounding, and the grooves 30g 30g .... are formed to be positioned outside of the surrounding of the hollow cylindrical part of the end lid 18 . The internal hole 33b of the friction plate 33 mounted at the teeth part 33a on the outside as shown in Fig. 4 c is freely fit to the surrounding of the convex strip 23c of the carrier 23 and the convex strip 18a of the end lid 183, while the teeth part 33a is engaged in each groove 30f 30f of the housing 30 , thereby, the incorporated friction plates 33 33 are interposed with the friction plate 343 as shown in Fig. 4 b , and the teeth part 34a fixed at the internal hole of the friction plate 34 is made slidable along the grooves 30f 30g only towards the cylindrical center against the housing 30 , also the friction plate 34 is made slidable along the convex strip 23c 18a only towards the cylindrical center against the carrier 23 and the end lid 18 , thereby, the stoppage of the movement of the friction plates 33 33 at both ends of the front and rear is made at the retaining rings 35 35 fit to the carrier 23 .The round ring shaped collars 36 36 are fit to each central boss part 30c in the front and rear part of the compartment 30d , thus the front and rear rooms 37 38 as formed at the collar 36 , compartment 30d and surrounding cylindrical part 30e are fit with each pistqn 39 40 of the round ring shape, and brake part 42 is each formed on the side of the room 38 . Moreover, the liquid transporting routes 18b 18c opened at the end lid 18 are interconnected with the liquid transporting route 12b of the output axial part 12 , and this route 12b 12c is equipped to connect with the concave holes 39a ova on the back of the pistons 39 40 connected to the liquid transporting route 36a of the collar 36 36 through the liquid transporting routes 30h 30i of the central boss part 30c , thus the pressureliquid of the pump,outside the drawing, driven by the motor 1 is transported to the change over valve 43 mounted on the fronttransmission case 3 , and it is transported from the wall part spa mounted to this changeover valve 43 into the liquid transporting pipe 44 or 45 arranged in the rear transmission case 11 , from which, being transported and supplied to the liquid transporting route 18b or 18c of the end lid 18 , also, being transported to rooms 37 38 from the concave hole 9a or 40a of the piston 39 or 40 being supplied, or it is formed in the manner that the pressureliquid of this room 37 38 is drained into the tank without drawing, by way of the above mentioned changeover valve 43 . Accordingly, when the pressure liquid pushes the piston 39 towards the direction of arrow mark A in Fig. 3, the friction plates 33 and 34 are connected integrally, then the housing 30 and the carrier 73 are unified by interconnection between the frictionplates 33 34 , thus the output axial part 12 is rotated in one body with directly connected major change gear axis 7 . Whereas when the piston 40 is pushed to the direction of the arrow mark B of the Fig. 3, the friction plate 33 engaged in the housing 0 is engaged in the end lid 18 , being connected tol.alwayd resting friction plate 34 , thus the solar gear 30b stands still, and it is formed that the rotation of the major change gear shaft 7 is transmitted to the output axial part 12 unified with the carrier 23 with deceleration by the self rotating planetary gear 29 being engaged with the internal gear 7a while making revolution around the solar gear 30b with the rotation of the major change gear shaft 7 .In other words, this decelerating ratio can be calculated by the following formula and the calculating table of synthetic rotation as listed in the Table 1. That is, the ratio of rotation speed is EMI14.1 Where, Z7 Number of teeth of internal gears 7a N7 Number of rotation of the above gear Z29 Number of teeth of planetary gear 29 N29 Number of rotation of the above gear Z30 Number of teeth of solar gear SOb N Number of rotaion of the above gear N27 Number of rotation of the carrier 27 N12 Number of rotation of output asial part united with the carrier Table 1 Calculating table for synthetic rotationsEMI15.1 SEP tb SEP Solar SEP gear SEP Planetary SEP Internal SEP Carrier SEP 23 tb SEP orb SEP gear 29 SEP teeth gear SEP Output SEP axial tb SEP 7a SEP Major SEP part l2 tb SEP change ear tb SEP shaft SEP t7 tb SEP .

Thereby, the remained pressure liquid in the concave hole 40a is pushed back towards the liquid transporting route 36b , and simultaneously, the pressure contact between each friction plate 33 and 54 of the brake part 42 can be released forcedly, and thus, the so called clutching sharyness can be obtained.Even in the case of pushing the piston 40 of the brake part 42 towards the direction of the arrow line B , the above 11sharpness can be obtained betlfeeen the friction plates 35 and 34 of the clutch part 42 by the operation of the connecting pin 46 as in the above.
