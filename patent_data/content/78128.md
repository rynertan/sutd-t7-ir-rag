# A drive bearing device for a fluid displacement apparatus.

## Abstract
A fluid displacement apparatus is disclosed which includes a housing having a front end plate 11 , a fixed fluid displacement member 25 and an orbiting fluid displace ment member 26 . The fixed and orbiting members interfit to make a plurality of line contacts to define sealed off fluid pockets. A driving mechanism, including a drive shaft 13 , is disposed within the housing and is connected to the orbiting member to effect orbital motion of the orbiting member upon rotation of the drive shaft. The drive shaft is rotatably supported by the front end plate through an angular bearing 33 disposed within the front end plate. The pressure cone apex of the angular bearing coincides with the driving point of the orbiting member. A thrust race 35 is disposed on one axial end surface of the angular bearing, and a ring plate 34 is disposed within the front end plate facing the thrust race at a predetermined axial distance. A thrust bearing 36 is placed in the axial gap between the thrust race and the ring plate to carry the thrust force from the angular bearing.
