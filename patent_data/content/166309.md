# MEMORY CHIP FOR A HIERARCHICAL MEMORY SYSTEM MEMORY CHIP FOR A HIERARCHICAL MEMORY SYSTEM

## Abstract
A dual ported memory chip 20 for a hierarchical mem ory, comprising an addressable memory array 28 for multi bit words, and a multi bit register 30 . Data is transferred a word at a time between the memory array 28 and a multi bit bus 22 to a higher level 24 in the memory system and between the memory array 28 and the register 30 . Data is transferred a bit at a time between the register 30 and a single serial line 26 . Concurrent operations are possible for transfers between the memory array 28 and the parallel bus 22 and between the register 30 and the serial line 26 .
