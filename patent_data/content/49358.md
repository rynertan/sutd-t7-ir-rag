## Description
STRONTIUM AND BARIUM CONTAINING ALKOXYLATION SYSTEMS FOR UNSATURATED ALCOHOLS This invention relates to the production of alkoxylated unsaturated alcohols by reacting said compounds in the presence of barium containing and strontium containing catalysts. More particularly, this invention relates to the production of alkoxylated unsaturated alcohols by reacting said compounds in the presence of these catalysts with adducting materials such as ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. The general reaction of a variety of organic materials together with an adducting material such as ethylene oxide or propylene oxide to form alkoxylated materials is known in the art. For example, U.S. Patent 2,683,087 discloses that water adsorption by paper articles is improved by the use of amine adducts of ethylene oxide. Another pulp and paper use is disclosed in Etho Chemicals by Armour and Company which discloses that ethoxylated resin fatty acid or ethoxylated stearic acid are incorporated in formulations used for deinking wastepaper. Redeposition of the ink particles is reduced by the use of these surfactants and stabilizers. British Patent 847,714 teaches the processing of pre hydrolyzed sulfate wood pulp into viscose by incorporating a propylene oxide ethylene oxide adduct of ethylene diamine.French Patent 1,122,729 discloses the use of an acylarylpolyglycol adduct to the viscose pulp or slurry. U.S. Patent 2,392,103 shows the use of alkyl thioether adducts to viscose pulp. BritishPatent 815,508 discloses the addition to viscose pulp of an adduct containing at least 7 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of an aliphatic acid, amide, or aldehyde. U.S. 2,875,078 describes the use of an oleyl adduct of ethylene oxide in the preparation of a compound having the general formula alkyl C12 C20 O C2H4O 630 3 6 2 which is used as a modifier in the viscose process to improve tensile strength and other properties of yarn. Belgium Patent 555,529 discloses an anti static agent for synthetic fibers which is produced by esterifying one mole of lauric acid with one mole of an ethoxylated glycerol. British Patent 763,215 suggests ethoxylated organic sulfamides as anti static agents for textiles. BritishPatent 779,491 discloses anti static treatment of textiles with an ether, amine, or thioether adduct having a mole weight of at least 2000 plus a sulfated fatty acid salt or its ester. British Patent 774,035 discloses that dyeing of wool with metal complex dyes is improved in the presence of an anionic surfactant and an alkylene oxide adduct such as 60 etho stearic acid amide. British Patent 738,379 discloses that textiles are impregnated against soiling with a solution of a stearic acid adduct of about 6000 molecular weight. British Patent 705,117 discloses an emulsifier combination for pesticides comprising a mixture which includes a tall oil or dodecyl mercaptan adduct. British Patent 858,687 teaches emulsifiable concentrates of pentachlorophenol which includes 1 to 5 of 3 etho alkyl propylene diamines.U.S. Patent 2,552,187 shows emulsifiable concentrates comprising a biologically active agent, an alkyl mercaptan abduct, and other materials. Polyol ethoxylates find uses in foods and feeds.As an example, U.S. Patent 2,674,534 discloses the use of sorbitol laurate and sorbitol oleate adducts in the coating of ice cream bars. The use of ethoxylated fatty acids such as 8 etho coco fatty acid has been recognized as a feed additive to accelerate animal growth. Alkylene oxide adducts are also used in the leather industry in formulations for tanning, dyeing, and lubricating leathers. U.S. Patent 2,893,811 shows the use of 12 to 18 carbon atom etho fatty amines for dyeing of vegetable tanned leathers. U.S. 2,946,649 shows that adducts of higher molecular weight sulfonamides are effective tanning agents. Adducts of these materials also have a variety of uses in metal working industries. Ester, ether, and amine adducts are the products used most frequently. Cleaning of metal via degreasing using alkali is practiced extensively.Because of the low foaming characteristics, adducts of esters, ethers, and amines are preferred over many other agents when metals are sprayed by alkaline media. Efficiency of a degreasing bath is improved by the addition of a lauric acid adduct. Ethylene oxide adducts such as sorbitan monostearate adducts have been found useful in pharmaceutical and cosmetic preparations and are used to provide activities such as drug carriers, emulsifiers, and solublizers. Some adducts have their own pharmacological actions. Oleic acid adducts plus other substances impart mechanical and chemical stability to latex rubber. U.S. Patent 3,088,796 discloses a formulation which imparts protection to metal surfaces against corrosion by a flowing stream, one component of such formulations being an ethoxylated alkylamine. U.S. Patent 3,060,132 discloses that a Ziegler catalyst can be modified to prevent the loss of activity on storage by the addition of ethododecyl mercaptan. German 1,142,465 discloses that polyglycol esters derived from reacting ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide with aliphatic or aromatic carboxylic acids prevents carburetor icing when added to gasoline. Other uses for alkylene oxide and propylene oxide adducts are given in Schonfeldt, SurfaceActive Ethylene Oxide Adducts, Pergammon Press, OxfordEngland, 1969 pages 386 through 631. These reactions are normally carried out using alkaline catalysts, which invariably produce a distribution of various adducts. In surfactant applications, an adduct containing too few adducting molecules is not effective because of poor solubility, while one with too many adducting molecules is undesirable because surface tension reduction per unit mass decreases drastically as the molecular weight increases. Therefore, most desirable adducts deal with as sharp a distribution in the desired mole adduct range as possible. Normally, an acid catalyzed reaction will produce such alkoxylates, but such catalysts also produce higher levels of harmful side products which must be separated and removed prior to use. Therefore, great benefit would be provided by a catalyst system which provides low by product levels while retaining the desired mole adduct distribution of acid catalysts. Such catalysts could promote the narrowing of the product distribution curve which could contribute significantly to the intrinsic value of the adducts produced. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a catalyst and method for obtaining alkoxylated adducts of unsaturated alcohols using strontium containing and or barium containing catalysts. Other objects will become apparent to those skilled in this art as the descriptior proceeds. It has now been discovered according to the present invention that unsaturated alcohols can be alkoxylated by contacting these materials with an alkoxylating agent in the presence of a catalyst selected from the group consisting of strontium metal, barium metal, strontium oxide, barium oxide, strontium hydroxide, hydrated strontium hydroxide, barium hydroxide, hydrated barium hydroxide, strontium hydride, barium hydride, or mixtures of these wherein the alkoxylation is carried out at temperatures of from about 90 C to about 260 C. The process of the instant invention can be carried out at ambient pressure. However, pressures up to about 100 pounds per square inch gauge, psig can also be used.Pressures below about 60 psig are preferred. Pressures below ambient can also be used but are not preferred. It is clear that while pressure or lack of pressure is not a detriment to the process of the present invention, it is simply more convenient to carry out the reaction in the pressure range of from about atmospheric to about 100 psig. The instant invention is normally carried out at temperatures of from about 1200C to about 2500C. However, for practical purposes commercial operations will normally be carried out in a temperature range of from about 1500C to about 2000C. Temperatures in the range of from about 1600C to about 1900C are most preferred. Reactions can be carried out in the presence of any alkoxylating agent which produces a mole adduct of the sort desired. Normally such agents are alpha or beta alkylene oxides. In most commercial operations either ethylene oxide, propylene oxide or mixtures of these will be used to produce an adduct. Of these products, ethylene oxide is most preferred. Reaction products can have any desired content of alkoxylating agents such as ethylene oxide, but will normally range from about 30 to about 85 content of ethoxylating agent based on weight. For most purposes, the content of alkoxylating agent will range from about 40 to about 80 by weight. The amount of such materials present in the reaction is not critical other than the minimum amount necessary to provide sufficient units to reach the mole adduct level desired for the material being reacted. The strontium containing and barium containing catalysts of the present invention are basic catalysts which provide the benefits of such catalysts while greatly reducing the amount of unreacted materials and undesirable by products normally found in sharp distribution reactions. In addition, the instant invention provides that effective amounts of promoters can be added to the strontium containing and barium containing catalysts. These promoters are selected from the group consisting of phenols, acids, amines, amides, aldehydes, polyols, ketones, or alcohols in order to further reduce by product reactions and to reduce or eliminate any induction periods necessary for alkoxylation to begin. Representative examples of strontium containing materials are strontium metal, strontium hydride, strontium oxide, strontium hydroxide, and strontium hydroxide.XH2O where X represents the number of water molecules present. Representative examples of barium containing materials are barium metal, barium hydride, barium oxide, barium hydroxide, and barium hydroxide.XH2O where X represents the number of water molecules present. Many of the strontium and barium compounds alone are active in the process of the present invention and are extremely active when used with an effective amount of a cocatalyst or a promoter. Mixtures of these catalysts can be used. When used, these catalyst mixtures can be used in any desire effective quantity. However, the larger the quantity used, the more quickly the reaction goes to completionLarger quantities do not appear to significantly alter the distribution obtained. For practical purposes, normally at least about 0.1 strontium or barium catalyst, based on the weight of the material to be reacted is present in the reaction, but up to about 5 weight percent is commonly used.Most commercial reactions will use from about 0.1 to about 2.0 weight percent based on the weight of the material to be reacted. The amount of promoter or co catalyst which should be present with a strontium or barium containing catalyst is generally an effective amount. The effect of the co catalyst or promoter becomes significant at somewhat above 0.1 by weight based on the weight of the material to be reacted.It is logical to expect an upper limit after which any promote present produces no additional benefits. Normally, these materials are added to the strontium or barium catalysts in amounts ranging from about 0.1 to about 2 by weight based upon the weight of the material to be reacted. It is very apparent that these limits can be varied substantially. The instant invention is generally effective with all classes of unsaturated alcohols. Representative examples of such alcohols are acetylenic alcohols These alcohols include hexynols such as l hexyn 3 ol, ethyloctynols such as 4 ethyl l octyn 3 ol, methylbutynols such as 2 methyl 3butyn 2 ol and methylpentynols such as 3 methyl l pentyn 3 ol. Other alcohols include cis 9 octadecen l ol, 2,5dimethyl 3 hexyne 2,5 diol, 2,6 dimethyl 4 octyne 3,6 diol and 2,4,7,9 tetramethyl 5 decyne 4,7 diol. It has also been discovered that the present invention can be carried out even more efficiently and rapidly in the presence of a catalyst promoter. The catalyst promoter can be one or more of a number of materials which are added to an alkoxylation system together with the catalyst or catalysts of choice. Representative examples of catalyst promoters useful in the process of the present invention are polyols, aldehydes, ketones, amides, amines, acids, phenols, mercaptans, and alcohols, wherein the alkoxyation is carried out at a temperature of from about 900C to about 2600C. Useful promoters for the strontium containing and barium containing catalysts of the present invention are a polyols having boiling points above 100 C, a total of 2 to 30 carbon atoms and having 2 or more adjacent or non adjacent hydroxyl containing moieties of the general formulaEMI7.1 wherein R1, R2, and R3 are, independently, linear or branched acyclic groups, alicyclic groups, aryl groups, cyclic groups, or hydrogen, and wherein the R designated groups canin addition contain one or more functional groups selected from the group consisting of ether, amine, carboxyl, halogen, nitro, carbonyl, and amide b aldehydes and ketones having boiling points above 100 C, a total of from 2 to 30 carbon atoms and having one or more adjacent or non adjacent carbonyl containing moieties of the general formulaEMI7.2 wherein R1, R2 are independently, hydrogen, linear or branched acyclic groups, alicyclic groups, cyclic groups, or aryl groups, and wherein the R designated groups can in addition contain one or more functionalities selected from the group consisting of carboxyl, hydroxyl, ether, halogen, nitro, amine, or amide c primary, secondary, or tertiary amides having boiling points above 1000C, a total of from 1 to 30 carbon atoms and containing 1 or more amide containing moieties of the general formulaEMI8.1 wherein R1, R2, and R3 are, independently, hydrogen, linear or branched acyclic groups, alicyclic groups, cyclic groups, or aryl groups and wherein the R designated groups can in addition contain one or more other functionalities selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl, ether, carboxyl, carbonyl, amine, nitro, or halogen d primary, secondary, or tertiary amines having boiling points above 1000C, a total of 1 to 30 carbon atoms and containing 1 or more amine containing moieties of the general formulaEMI8.2 wherein R1, R2, and R3 are, independently, hydrogen, linear or branched acyclic groups, alicyclic groups, cyclic groups, or aryl groups, and wherein the R designated groups can in addition contain one or more functionalities selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl1 ether, carbonyl, halogen, carboxyl, nitro, or amide and e organic acids having boiling points above 1000C, a total of 1 to 30 carbon atoms and having 1 or more adjacent or non adjacent carboxylic acid containing moieties of the general formulaEMI9.1 wherein R1 is hydrogen, a linear or branched acyclic group, alicyclic group, cyclic group, or aryl group, and wherein the R group can in addition contain one or more functionalities selected from the group consisting of carbonyl, hydroxyl, halogen, ether, nitro, amine, or amid f phenols having boiling points of above 1000C, a total of from 6 to 30 carbon atoms and having 1 or more functionalities of the general formulaEMI9.2 wherein R11 R2, R3, R4, and R5 are, independently, hydrogen, halogen, hydroxyl, nitro, ether, or carbonyl, linear or branched acyclic groups, alicyclic groups, cyclic groups, aryl groups, or substituted aryl groups, and wherein in addition the R designated groups can contain one or more functionalities selected from the group consisting of halogen, ether, nitro, carboxyl, carbonyl, amine, amide, or hydroxyl, primary and secondary, linear and branched and g mercaptans of the general formulaEMI9.3 wherein R1, R2 and R3 are, independently, hydrogen, linear or branched acyclic groups, alicyclic groups, cyclic groups, or aryl groups, and wherein the R designated groups can in addition contain one or more functionalities selected from the group consisting of carboxyl, hydroxyl, ether, halogen, nitro, amine, or amide In some cases it is advantageous to preform or prereact the catalyst promoter with the catalyst prior to addition to the alkoxylation system. When this is carried out, the desired amount of catalyst is reacted with an effective amount of promoter for a period of time ranging up to about 4 hours up to about 2000C. Normally however, such preforming or prereaction will be carried out at temperatures of from about 25oC to about 1600C for periods of time ranging from about 0.5 to about 2.5 hours. Such preformed catalysts can be isolated and recovered or in the preferred embodiment simply added as a reaction mixture to the major alkoxylation reaction.Many of the materials susceptible to alkoxylation reactions using the catalyst of the present invention are also effective promoters, both with each other and with other groups of materials.

alcohols can also act as promoters for ethoxylation of organic material using strontium containing or barium containing catalysts. Such alcohols are more acidic than normal alcohols such that the association constant is greater or the pKa is lower than normal alcohols.Thus, these alcohol promoters would have a pKa less than 17. These alcohols are those containing a hydroxyl group and having the formula EMI19.1 wherein R1, R2, and R3 are, independently, hydrogen, linear or branched acyclic groups, alicyclic groups, aryl groups, or cyclic groups, and wherein the R designated groups can in addition contain functional groups selected from the group consisting of halogen, nitro, carboxyl, amine, carbonyl, ether, and amide. The molecule can contain a total of from 2 to 30 carbon atoms. Representative examples of these effective alcohol promoters are triphenylmethanol trichloroethanol trifluoroethanol 2 nitroethanol 2 chloroethanol 2,2 dichloroethanol 2 methoxyethanol 2 chlorocyclohexanol ortho chlorobenzyl alcohol The invention is more concretely described with reference to the examples below wherein all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified. The examples are provided to illustrate the instant invention and not to limit it. Example 1 A 600 cubic centimeter cc stainless steel reactor was charged with 120 grams oleyl alcohol, 0.2 gramBa OH 2.H2O catalyst and 0.2 gram nonyl phenol co catalyst.After purging with nitrogen at 250cc per minute for one hour at 1500C, the reactor was evacuated and the temperature raised to about 1750C. Ethylene oxide EO was then introduced to a total pressure of about 40 psig, and EO uptake of 97.6 grams was completed in 280 minutes at this pressure. The catalyst was then neutralized. Example 2 An experiment was carried out as in 1 except 1.6 grams Sr OH 2. 8H2O catalyst and 2.59 grams nonylphenol co catalyst were used. EO uptake was completed in 60 minutes after which the catalyst was neutralized. Example 3 An experiment is carried out as described in example 2 except propylene oxide is used as the alkoxylating agent. The propylene oxide requires more time to react to a comparable adduct level than a similar preparation usingEO. The propylene oxide adduct is narrow and peaked. The level of unreacted alcohol is much lower than a comparable adduct made by using alkali metal catalysts. Example 4 A stainless steel reactor 600cc is charged with 150 grams of cis 9 octadecene 1 ol and 0.8 gram preformed strontium hydroxide phenol catalyst. The catalyst was preformed in a small round bottom flask that was charged with 10 grams Sr OH 2.8E2O and 10.6 grams phenol. The flask was attached to a rotary evaporator and the contents heated to 1500C for 1 hour under vacuum. A weight of 9v55 grams of preformed catalyst was recovered. After purging with nitrogen at 250cc per minute for 1 hour at a temperature of 1500C the reactor is evacuated and the temperature raised to about 1750C, Ethylene oxide is then introduced to a total pressure of about 40 pounds per square inch gauge psig and an EO uptake of 150 grams is allowed to proceed at this pressure.After ethoxylation the catalyst is neutralized. The ethylene oxide adduct is narrow and peaked and has a lower level of unreacted alcohol than a comparable adduct prepared using alkali metal catalysts. Example 5 An experiment is carried out as described in example 1 except 0.8 gram Sr OH 2.8H2O and 0.4 gram ethylene glycol are used as co catalysts. EO adduct distribution is peaked and the level of unreacted alcohol is low. Example 6 An experiment is carried out as described in example 2 except 1.6 grams Sr OH 2.8H2O and 1.6 grams benzamide are used. Example 7 An experiment is carried out as described in example 2 except 2.2 grams lauryl aldehyde is used as a catalyst promoter. EO adduct distribution is peaked and unreacted alcohol level is low. Example 8 An experiment is carried out as described in example 2 except 0.8 gram Sr OH 2.8H2O and 1.6 grams hexadecylamine are used as co catalyst. Example 9 An experiment is carried out as described in example 1 except 0.5 gram Ba OH 2.H2O and 1.1 grams l dodecanethiol are used as co catalyst. Example 10 A stainless steel reactor 600cc is charged with 180 grams oleyl alcohol and 0.5 grams barium hydride catalyst. After purging the reactor with nitrogen at the rate of 500 cc s per hour for 30 minutes at 1500C the reactor is evacuated and the temperature raised to 1750C. Ethylene oxide EO is introduced to a total pressure of 40 pounds per square inch gauge psig and EO uptake of 120 grams is allowed to proceed at this pressure. After ethoxylation the catalyst is neutralized. EO adduct distribution is narrow and peaked relative to a comparable reaction product made using conventional caustic catalysts such as NaOH. Thus the instant invention provides a method for obtaining high mole adduct alkoxylates of unsaturated alcohols by contacting such materials with barium containing and strontium containing catalysts. Products obtained contain low amounts of by products and unreacted organic materials. Although exemplified as batch reactions, the catalyst and promoters of the present invention are extremely well suited to continuous reaction methods. The reaction products are of extremely high quality and quantity. While certain embodiments and details have been shown for the purpose of iliustrating this invention it will be apparent to those skilled in this art that various changes and modifications may be made herein without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention.
