# MEMBRANE KEYBOARD ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
The assembly includes a flexible insulating film 12 with indicia 21 visible on the upper surface and conductive contacts 14, 16, 18 on the lower surface. The top film may be comprised of two separate films 20, 12 for ease of applying the indicia and the contacts. The other contact of each SPST switch is a ground or reference contact formed by a chassis 10 or other relatively large and rigid conductive surface. A resilient spacer 22 is retained between the upper and lower switch contact surfaces and contains an aperture in registration with each upper switch contact.
