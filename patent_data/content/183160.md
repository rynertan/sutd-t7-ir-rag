# Preparation process of indole.

## Abstract
A process for producing an indole which comprises reacting an aniline and a diol in the presence of a catalyst to produce a reaction mixture containing the indole, unreacted aniline and by products, condensing the reaction mixture to obtain a liquid reaction product, recovering the unreacted aniline from the liquid reaction product, reducing the contents of specified by products in the recovered aniline below specified levels and reutilizing the resulting recovered aniline. To reduce the contents of the specified by products in the recovered aniline below specified levels, it is preferred to subject the liquid reaction product or an aniline fraction separated therefrom to a heat treatment and then to distilla tion. In the above manner, the recovered aniline can be reutilized in the reaction without causing the activity of the catalyst to deteriorate.
