## Description
ELECTROCRAPHIC METHOD OF FORMING CONDUCTIVE CIRCUIT PATTERNS AND CIRCUIT BOARDS FORMED THEREBY This invention relates to a method of foraing an electrically conductive circuit pattern on a substrate and to circuit boards formed by the method. Circuit boards are employed in various electrical apparatus as readily replaceable ele ments. The boards contain electrical components such as resistors, capacitors and the like. A typical board comprises an electrically insulating substrate and a circuit pattern of conductive material usually a metal such as copper formed on the substrate. In many instances, circuit patterns appear on both sides of the substrate, with electrical continuity provided between the patterns via conductive material deposited on the walls of boles in the substrate which are referred to in the art as throughholes . The conductive circuit pattern can be established by a number of conventional techniques.One involves precoating the entire substrate with copper, printing an etching resist corresponding to the circuit pattern desired on the copper, removing copper by etching in those areas not protected by etching resist and, finally, removing the etching resist to expose the circuit pattern. This process is referred to as subtractive and is considered by many to be economically unattractive. In a second technique, a conductive circuit pattern is formed by electroless plating in the circuit regions only, thus avoiding having to etch away noncircuit copper. This method is referred to as additive and constitutes the environment for the present invention. U.S. Patents 3,391,455 issued July 9, 1968, to H. Hirohata et al and 3,259,559 issuedJuly 5, 1966, to F. W. Schneble, Jr. et al describe electroless plating in the formation of printed circuit boards. Both patents describe printing or painting an adhesive pattern on a circuit board substrate, the adhesive in the pattern containing finely divided catalyst particles which are catalytic to electrolessly deposited copper. The adhesive is then cured and the board contacted with a plating solution to establish the electrically conductive circuit. Electroless plating of circuit boards by the prior art, hdwever, poses several difficulties.In particular, the catalytic adhesive compositions which are painted or printed on the substrate are often liquidbaset and thus require careful viral cosity control to avoid unwanted application in non circuit areas and to provide uniform application in circuit areas. These compositions, moreover, cannot be coated on the walls of through holes with the same facility as they are printed on the substrate surface.Thus, special steps are taken, such as the application of vacuum or vibration to draw the composition through the through holes, When such fabrication techniques are employed, the adhesive composition so applied is neither of uniform thickness in the through holes nor coatable on the walls of through holes having relatively small diameters for example, diameters of 3 millimeters or less , the adhesive compositions often plugging the through holes. Accordingly, it would be desirable to prepare circuit patterns by electroless plating wherein adhesive and catalyst particles are applied to the circuit pattern in a minimum number of steps. Futthermore, it would be desirable to apply adhesive to the substrate surface and the walls of through holes simultaneously. In accordance with the present invention, a pattern of adhesive is formed on a substrate electrographically, followed by adhering electroless plating catalyst particles to the adhesive. The method is clean and simple, and provides, as desired, uniform application of adhesive simultaneously to the surface of the substrate and to the walls of through holes, without requiring the use of vacuum or vibration for satisfactory application of adhesive in the through holes. The adhesive in the method of the invention is an electrographic polymeric toner which is electrostatically attracted to the charge pattern. The method, therefore, comprises a forming an electrostatic charge pattern on a sub strate, b developing the charge pattern with the electro graphic polymeric toner, c causing particles of an electroless plating catalyst to adhere to the toner, and d contacting the catalyst containing toner with an electroless plating bath to form thereon a con ductive pattern corresponding to the developed charge pattern. In a preferred embodiment, the electrostatic charge pattern extends to the opposite surface of the substrate via through holes. Development with the electrographic toner in this embodiment thus provides simultaneous application of toner to the substrate surface and the throughholes. The toner is uniformly distributed on the board surface and on the walls of the throughholes. No additional steps are necessary to ensure that toner does not plug the through holes. Thus, by practice of the present invention, printed circuit boards are provided in A minimum number of steps which avoid the difficulties associated with liquid based adhesives for adhering plating catalyst. The invention also includes a novel circuit board which can be made by the method of the invention. The circuit board, which comprises a substrate carrying a pattern of conductive material electrolessly deposited on particles of catalyst in a polymer layer, further contains at least one through hole in the pattern. The wails of the through hole comprise, in sequence a layer of catalyst free polymer, particles of catalyst embedded in and partially exposed from the polymer layer, and a layer of conductive material electrolessly deposited on the exposed portions of the catalyst particles. Figure 1 of the drawings is a plan view of a circuit board bearing a conductive circuit pattern in accordance with the present invention. Figure 2 is a sectional view of the circuit board in Figure 1 taken along the line Ak . Electrographic methods of forming toner images are well known, as shown, for example, inChapters XV XVl, pages 405 450, of Dessauer andClark, Xerography and Related Processes Focal Press, 1965 . These methods, which are useful in connection with the present invention, entail formation of an eleçtrostatic charge pattern on a curb strate and contacting the pattern with an electrostatically attractable toner to form a toner image of the pattern. In the present method, the circuit board serves as substrate. An electrostatic charge pattern is formed, for example, by exposing the gub strate to a corona charging device through a mask bearing a desired circuit pattern.As the mask transmits charge only in circuit regions, an electrostatic charge pattern of the desired circuit is formed on the substrate. Because of the nature of the electrical field, the pattern extends onto the walls of any through holes present in the area of the circuit pattern. Alternatively, an electrostatic charge pattern is formed on the substrate by means of stylus recording, or by sequentially charging the entire substrate and selectively dissipating the charge until only the desired circuit pattern remains. The magnitude and polarity of the charge pattern is varied in accordance with the magnitude and polarity of charge on the toner employed, as well as the insulating characteristics of the gub strate upon which the charge pattern is established. The charge pattern on the substrate, is developed with an electrographic polymeric toner, forming thereby a toner pattern corresponding to the charge pattern of the desired circuit. Such toners are well known to the art of electrography and are provided by liquid or dry developers. Dry developers are preferably employed and comprise electroscopic toner particles alone or in combination with discrete carrier particles. Developera having carriers are referred to as twocomponent dry developers, while developers composed solely of toner particles are referred to as single component dry developers. The carrier particle, whep employed, are often magnetically attractable to facilitate formation of so called magnetic brushes . During use, the toner particles separate from the mixture and attach to the charge pattern. Liquid developers, on the other hand, are dispersions of toner particles in an electrically insulating carrier liquid. The use of liquid developers, in this regard, is to be distinguished from the coating of circuit boards with liquid based adhesives as described in the prior art. In liquid electrographic development, the substrate, although coated with a liquid composition, retains only the toner component of the developer, the toner component electrostatically migrating from the liquid and adhering to the substrate only in areas of the charge pattern. The toner particles comprise polymeric materials which triboelectrically acquire a charge of such magnitude and polarity as to adhere to an electrostatic charge pattern.For use in the present invention, toner polymers are selected on the further basis of their capability of being rendered adhesive to electroless plating catalyst particles.Thus, thermoplastic polymers which become tacky above their glass transition temperatures and solvent softenable polymers, as well as heat soft enable, thermosetting polymers, are each employable. As a practical matter, circuit boards prepared in the manner set forth herein are often further subjected to solder baths to establish connection of circuit components inserted in through holes or applied to the circuit pattern.The temperature of such baths is typically in excess of 2400C. Accordingly, the conductive metal plated on the catalyst containing toner should remain intact under soldering conditions. This is achieved by the selection of toner polymers whose adhesion to plating catalyst is not significantly diminished at soldering temperatures. For example, in the case of thermoplastic polymers, those materials with Tg s approximately equal to or above the soldering temperature are preferred. Thermosetting polymers, on the other hand, are resistant to soldering temperatures after they have been thermoset. It will be appreciated, of course, that the time of residence of the circuit in a soldering bath is a factor in the selection of heat resistant toners.Thus, if the residence time is small in comparison with the time required for the toner polymer to become adversely affected under soldering conditions, lesser heat resistance can be tolerated. These factors are considered in selecting a suitable toner polymer for the particular soldering conditions anticipated. Thermoplastic polymers which are useful in the defined toners include those polymers employed in conventional electrographic development. Preferred thermoplastic polymers include those withTg s above 2000C so as to provide resistance to the effects of soldering when the latter is employed. Thermosetting polymers are preferred as toners. Prior to thermosetting these polymers, they are heat softened so as to permit fixing them to the circuit board after developing the electrostatic charge pattern. while the toner is still soft, catalyst particles are brought into contact with the softened toner and partially embedded therein, followed by heating to a higher temperature to initiate thermosetting cure of the toner. Typical thermosetting polymers include phenolic type resins, such as copolymers of phenol, resorcinol, a cresol, or a xylenol with an aldehyde or with furfural. Cross linked polyesters can also be used. Epoxy resins are particularly useful, such as the reaction product of epichlorohydrin 1chloro 2,3 epoxy propane with bisphenol A 2,2 di p hydroxyphenyl propane . Although epichlorohydrin is the most common organic epoxide employed in the formation of epoxy resins, other epoxides such as, for example, 1,2,3,4 diepoxy butane can also be used. Similarly, epoxy resins derived from phenols other than bisphe nol A are suitable for use. Such resins include, for example, the reaction product of epichlorohydrin with resorcinol, with phenols derived from cashew nut oils, with hydroquinonec, with 1,5 dihydroxy naphthalene or 2,2,5,5 tetrabis 4 hydroxy phenyl hexane. Phenolic intermediates of the resol type, hydrazines and sulfonamides, such as, for example, 2,4 toluene disulfonamide, are also useful for reaction with an organic epoxide to produce epoxy resins suitable for use.Aliphatic epoxy resins are also suitable. Such resins are, for example, the reaction product of epichlorohydrin with glycerol, with ethylene glycol or with pentaerythritol. Phenolic type thermosetting resins which are employed as the toner include, for example, copolymers of formaldehyde with p cresol, ethyl phenol, g tert butyl phenol, tert amyl phenol, p tert octyl phenol, di isobutyl phenol, or a bisphe nol , such as 4,4 isopropylidene diphenol or 2,2bis E hydroxy phenyl propane. Suitable thermosetting polymers includeVedox VP180 trade mark toner a polyurethane polymer marketed by Ferro Corp., Cleveland, Ohio Veaox KA237 trade mark for a polyester thermosetting polymer marketed by Ferro Corp. and Corvel ECA 1555 PC trade mark for an epoxy polymer from Polymer Corp., Reading, Pennsylvania Before the step of electroless plating, particles of electroless plating catalyst are caused to adhere to the surface of the toner pattern. These particles serve gs catalytic sites to facilitate the chemical reduction of metal salts by reducing agents in electroless plating baths, as discussed below.When reduced, the metals from the salts deposit on the plating catalyst to form the conductive circuit. In the case of copper as the electrolessly plated metal, the catalyst comprises finely divided particles of metal or metal oxides, such as titanium, aluminum, copper, iron, steel, cobalt, zinc, titanium oxide, copper oxide and mixtures or alloys of such metals andlor metal oxides. The catalyst particles are caused to adhere to the toner pattern to provide a firm bond during subsequent electroless plating. Preferably, the catalyst is partially embedded in the toner and partially exposed therefrom, a configuration which provides a strong bond while permitting deposition of the conductive material. The partial embedding catalyst in an adhesive layer on a circuit board is disclosed inU.S. Patent 3,391,455. The size of the catalyst particles and the size of the toner particles are interrelated insofar as smaller catalyst particles generally adhere to small toner particles better than do large catalyst particles. The size of toner particles, moreover, is governed in part by the degree of image resolution desired and smallest dimension of the circuit pattern contemplated. Complex networks of closely spaced circuit lines, on the one hand, may call for small diameter toners while simpler patterns may permit the use of larger toners. Useful results are achieved with toner particles having a mean diameter from 5 to 40 micrometers, preferably from 10 to 20 micrometers.Toners in these particlecsize ranges are employed with catalyst particles having a mean diameter from about 5 to about 80 micrometers, preferably from about 30 to about 60 micrometers. When the catalyst particles are adhered to the toner, electroless plating can proceed. If the toner polymer is thermosetting, further heating is employed to thermoset the polymer before plating, thereby establishing a stronger bond between catalyst and toner, and ultimately between conductive metal plate and toner. It is often the practice to treat the catalyst to expose fresh, dirt free catalyst surface and thereby facilitate the catalysis of subsequent electroless plating. This can be accomplished by treatment with aqueous acids such as aqueous sulfuric acid or aqueous hydrochloric acid prior to plating.Alternatively, the catalyst can be lightly abraded with steel wool, sand paper or other abrasive material. Generally, such treatment, if employed, is carried out after catalyst is adhered to toner. The electroless plating step practiced in accordance with the present invention comprises contacting the catalyst containing toner pattern with an electroless plating bath to deposit thereon a conductive material. Electroless plating is also known as autocstalytic plating and has sometimes been called chemical plating. Plating baths are based on the process of catalytic reduction of metal salts. The chemical reducers commonly employed are sodium hypophosphite, formaldehyde, sodium borohydride and aminoboranes. The electroless baths are so formulated that the metal salt and the reducer will react only in the presence of a catalyst. Representative electroless plating baths for arsenic, chromium, cobalt, cobalt nickel, copper, gold, iron, nickel or palladium are disclosed in Metal Finishing, 1977, pp. 474 484. Electroless plating baths for depositing copper or other metals such as nickel are also disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,259,559 issued July 5, 1966, to F.W. Schneble,Jr., et al, and 3,391,455, mentioned above. Preferred plating baths for the present invention are copper baths. A representative copper plating bath comprises copper nitrate, sodium bicarbonate, Rochelle salt, sodium hydroxide and formaldehyde at a pH of about 11.5. The baths disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,259,559 comprise a soluble copper salt e.g., copper sulfate, cupric chloride, cupric nitrate, copper gluconate, or cupric acetate a complexing agent for the cupric ions e.g.,Rochelle salts ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid and its sodium salt nitrolotriacetic acid and salts thereof N hydroxyethylenediamine triacetate triethanolamine sugar, including sucrose, dextrose, lactose, levulose or maltose mannitol sorbitol, or gluconic acid an alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide, such as sodium or potassium hydroxide an active reducing agent such as formaldehyde and a small amount of a complexing agent for cuprous ion, such as cyanide salts, e.g., sodium and potassium cyaninlde, acrylonitrilet lactonitrile, glyconi true, thiourea, allyl alcohol and ethylene. Preferred for use as the complexing agent for cuproug ion are the cyanide salt, such as sodium and potassium cyanide, crylonitrile, lactonitrile, and glyconitrile. Suitable commercially available copper electroless plating baths include Metex ElectrolessCopper Baths 9027 and 9048 and Meter PTH Electroless Copper Bath 9072 etex is a trade mark from acDermid Incorporated, Waterbury, Conneotic t and Enpiate trade mark Cu4OO from thone orpw orated, New Haven, Connecticut. The elertrolesgly plated circuit board ts readily soldered by dipping in a hot solder bath whereby solder is deposited on the conductive circuit pattern. Advantageously, the present invention facilitates application of auniformly thick conduc tive circuit pattern on the walls of through holes on substrates. Such through holes most preferably have diameters of 3 millimeters or smaller, preferably diameters of from about 1 to 2 millimeters. The electrographic method described herein is further employed to form circuit patterns on one side or two sides of a circuit board, with or without through holes. Formation of a conductive pattern on two sides of a substrate, referred to as duplexing , is practiced by the procedure set forth above on one side of the board, and thereafter repeating the procedure for the second side. Alternative methods of duplexing are also contemplated in which the sequence of steps associated with the formation of the pattern on one side of the substrate is interrupted at any point or points by one or more of the steps associated with the opposite side pattern as desired. Advantageously, one can also duplex by simultaneously establishing an electrostatic charge pattern on both sides of the board, the charge pattern extending through any through holes as noted above. The steps of charge development, catalystadhering, curing and electroless plating are then practiced in sequence as set forth above. Thus, a two ided circuit board is produced by the same num ber of steps required to produce a single sided board. Circult bourd substrates upon which the described circuit patterns of electrolessly plated conductive patterns are formed are, of necessity, electrically insulating on those surfaces intended for carrying the circuit patterns. Useful sub strates include synthetic resins, metals, synthetics such as wallboard, masonite board and the like, all as described in U.S. Patent 3,259,559, column 13. In the case of metal blanks, insulating coatings such as an epoxy resin coating can be applied to the surface upon which the circuit patterns will be established. A conductive circuit pattern formed on a substrate and extending onto through hole walls in accordance with the present invention is illustrated in Figures 1 and 2. Fig. 1 depicts a finished circuit board 1 comprising a substrate 2 carrying a pattern of conductive material 3 including through holes 4 within the pattern. Referring toFig. 2, showing a cross section of one of these through holes taken along a line AA , conductive material 3 is deposited indirectly on the walls of through hole 4 . In particular, conductive material 3 within the through hole is electrolessly deposited on exposed portions of catalyst particles 6 partially embedded within polymeric adhesive layer 5 .Polymeric adhesive layer S preferably is electrographically formed and fixed directly onto the through hole walls in accordance with the method of the present invention. Adhesive layer 5 , aside from containing catalyst particles 6 embedded in its surface, is otherwise substantially free from catalyst particles throughout the bulk of its thickness in that portion of the adhesive layer 5 deposited on the throughhole walls. Preferably, catalyst free adhesive layer 5 extends uniformly and continuously from one surface of substrate 2 to the opposite surface via through hole 4 , forming thereby a duplexed circuit board. In the duplexed mode, moreover, conductive material layer 3 is substantially free from irregularities, such that cross sections of plated through hole 4 taken along its cylindrical axis 7 are substantially the same at all points, particularly at the entrances to the through hole. The following examples are included to aid in understanding the present invention. In each of the examples, an epoxy coated aluminum substrate was employed. This substrate was prepared from dte punched aluminum sheeting which had been deburred, chemically cleaned and coated with 3M 5230 trade mark epoxy powder in a fluidized bed to a thickness of about 6 mils 150 micrometers . The epoxy powder was cured at 2009for 5 minutes. Example 1 This example illustrates electrographic forming of a printed circuit board using a commercially available two component, electrographic developer. An epoxy coated aluminum plate was charged with a corona charger to 500V through a negative image metal mask and the resultant electrostatic charge pattern was developed with a dry developer containing a toner comprising a carbon blackpigmented cross linked styrene acrylic thermoplastic resin. The toner image was fixed on a hot plate at 1100C for 2 3 minutes followed by a dusting thereof with cuprous oxide powder. The toner in turn was fixed again by placing the element on a hot plate at 1100C for 2 3 minutes and all loose metal powder removed. The image bearing board was then dipped in an acid bath to activate the metal surface, rinsed with water and immersed in a Metex trade mark Electroless Copper Bath 9027 for about 1 hour followed by a water rinse. Copper plating resulted on the pattern of fixed toner.Example 2 This example illustrates the use of a toner containing a thermoplastic polymer having a higherTg than the toner polymer of Example 1. A toner polymer having a Tg of 2140C was coarse ground and then finely ground with a fluid energy mill. The final toner was used with an iron carrier to form a developer at a toner concentration of 3.5 , by weight, with respect to the developer, and its charge was measured to be 50.0 coul g. A charge pattern was established on the metal base plate of Example 1, toned with the above developer with a magnetic brush, and the tonerbearing image fixed at 2800C for 5 minutes. Copper powder having an average particle size of 15 20 micrometers was dusted onto the toner while heating continued for about 1 minute. The board was cooled to room temperature and the copper powder activated by a l minute dip treatment in an acid bath lZ HCl solution followed by l hour immersion in a NETEX trade mark Electroless Copper Bath 9027. Treatment of the circuit board for 2 10 seconds in a 2400C float solder bath did not affect the adhesion of the toner to the substrate or the copper plate to the toner. A 900 bent copper wire was hand soldered to a 3 mm diameter dot of plated circuit. The soldered connection withstood up to 1 pound of force applied to the unsoldered end of the copper wire herein after referred tt as the pull force test Example 3 This example illustrates the formation of a circuit board using a thermosettable polymer toner. Epoxy coated aluminum supports were coronacharged through a metal mask and toned with Vedox trade mark thermosetting resin, EA 237 a polyester and VP 180 a polyurethane , each available from Ferro Corporation, Cleveland,Ohio. Both resins charged negatively againstHoeganes EH trade mark iron ear rier. With respect to each toner employed, the toned image was softened to a tacky state at IQOOC for 2 minutes. The board was then placed on a 1509C hot plate and dusted with steel powder.Curing or the toned image was completed at 2009C for 20 m n utes and the surface of the steel powder was actiw vated by an acid bath dip s 30 seconds in 20Z ECS solution followed by an electroless copper treatment for 16 hours in Metex 9017 Electroless CopperBath . The adhesion of plate to toner and toner to circuit board in a hot, flow solder bath was good. Each plate withstood a pull force of about S 10 pounds.Example 4 This example illustrates the production of a two sided circuit board with through the hole copper additive plating. The procedure of Example 3 above was used except for the following modifications a the metal imaging mask thickness was reduced from 250 to 125 micrometers 0.010 to 0.005 to improve mask to board contact and better resolution b the epoxy clad boards contained 3 mm through holes and were imaged using Ferro Corp VP 180 trade mark toner fixed at 1000C for 2 minutes and c the second side of the board was imaged, and the toner image fixed at EOOOC for 2 minutes. The duplexed board was then immersed in steel powder average particle size of 50p at 150 C, cured at 2000C for 20 minutes, activated for 30 seconds in 20Z HC1 solution, and copper plated in a METEX 9027 trade mark plating bath for 16 hours. The duplexed board was treated successfully in a 2400C float solder bath for 2 10 seconds.Straight copper wires were soldered to the throughhole walls and subjected to a pull force test. The soldered wire connections withstood up to 20 26 pounds of applied force.
