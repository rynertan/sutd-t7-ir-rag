# Method of and device for fabricating optical fibre preforms.

## Abstract
The diameter of the supporting tube of the preform TQ can be kept constant by this method, notwithstanding the tube tendency to collapse owing to the high temperature necessary to reactant synthesis reaction and raw material deposition. The diameter is controlled by generating between the in ternal and the external tube surface a pressure difference var iable in a way inversely proportional to the diameter of the tube itself and to the total gas flow at the input. The device GP allows the generation of the required pressure loss at the output and the separation of raw material solid particles from residual gases.
