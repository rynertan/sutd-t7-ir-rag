# EXPLOSIVELY ACTIVATED ASSEMBLY FOR REPAIRING HEAT EXCHANGE TUBES

## Abstract
The invention relates to the repair of heat exchange tubes and is directed at an explosive activated assembly having a sleeve 14 which is inserted into an end of the tube 12 to be repaired and has a plurality of projections 18 extending from the outer surface thereof. A force transmitting member 20 extends within a bore 22 formed in the sleeve 14 and contains an explosive member 24 so that, upon detonation of the explosive member 24 , the force transmitting member 20 and the sleeve 14 are expanded radially outwardly to drive the projections 18 against the tube 12 .
