# Heat retaining moisture transmissible water resistant fabric.

## Abstract
A heat retaining moisture transmissible water resistant fabric which comprises i a fibrous substrate, ii a discon tinuous polymer layer or a polymer layer having a multiplic ity of interconnecting fine pores layer A , formed on at least one surface of the substrate, and iii a polymer layer layer B formed on layer A, layer B contains 15 to 70 wt. , based on the polymer of the layer B, of heat ray reflecting fine metal pieces and has a multiplicity of interconnecting fine pores communicating from the surface to the interior and also has on the surface thereof fine pores, most of which have a size not larger than 5 µm. The fabric may comprise, in lieu of layer B, iv a microporous polymer film layer layer C , formed on layer A and having a multiplicity of intercon necting fine pores communicating in all the direction in the interior of layer C, most of which have a size of at least 1 µm, and v a polymer layer layer D containing 10 70 wt. based on the polymer of the layer D, of a heat ray reflecting fine metal pieces and having on the surface thereof fine pores having a size smaller than 0.5 µm and also having fine pores communicating with said fine surface pores, most of which have a size not larger than 1 µm.
