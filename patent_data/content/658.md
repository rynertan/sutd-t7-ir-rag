# Process for preparing ethylenically unsaturated isocyanurates.

## Abstract
Process for the preparation of ethylenically unsaturated isocyanurates comprising reacting polyisocyanate with a monohydric alcohol containing a vinylidene group in the presence of a copper salt to form an isocyanate containing urethane and then trimerizing the isocyanate containing urethane to form an ethylenically unsaturated isocyanaurate. The ethylenically unsaturated isocyanurate may be homopolymerized or copolymerized with ethylenically unsaturated monomers to form high molecular weight polymers having excellent physical properties.
