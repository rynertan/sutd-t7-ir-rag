## Description
This invention relates to a novel recombinant DNA and its use. More specifically, this invention relates to a recombinant DNA having a human Cu Zn superoxide dismutase structural gene downstream of a regulatory gene, and its use. Superoxide dismutase SOD for short is an enzyme having the action of scavenging superoxide 2 in accordance with the following disproportionation reaction.EMI1.1 SOD can be classified into three types, copperzinc type Cu,Zn SOD , manganese type Mn SOD and iron type Fe SOD according to the metals contained in the molecule. Cu,Zn SOD exists mainly in the cytoplasms of eukaryotes such as humans or animals, and Mn SOD exists in mitochondria. Procaryotes such as bacteria, on the other hand, have both Mn SOD and Fe SOD within the cells. It is McCord Science, 185, 529 531, 1974 who first discovered that SOD has an anti inflammatory action.He used SOD purified from bovine erythrocytes in his work.The anti inflammatory action of SOD derived from bacteria is also known Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No.16685 1983 . These SODs are heterogenous proteins for humans, and involve a danger of causing undesirable immune responses. It is preferred to use human SOD as a medicine for humans. Much information has already been available on the method of preparing human SOD from human cells or tissues see, for example, Japanese Laid Open PatentPublications Nos. 141288 1982, 155991 1982, and 91881 1984 . The prior methods, however, have not proved to be entirely suitable for industrial production because the raw material is difficult to obtain in large quantities, and the human placenta which is a relatively easily available raw material has a low SOD content. A process utilizing recombinant DNA permits mass production and is industrially suitable. To have the human SOD gene express within a microorganism and produce human SOD protein, the selection of a regulatory gene is important. Heretofore, regulatory genes called trp promoter, lac W5 promoter, PL promoter, tac promoter, etc. have frequently been used. These regulatory genes undergo negative regulation, and as a regulation of gene expression in a microorganism, the existence of positive regulation is known. Furthermore, genes which undergo both negative regulation and positive regulation are known, and examples include lactose operon lac , galactose operon gal and colicin El gene. In the regulatory genes of these genes, a region participating in the positive regulation exists upstream of a region participating in the negative regulation. In the negative regulation, usually a repressor binds to the operator region to repress expression.When the repression is released by an inducer, transcription by RNA polymerase bound to the promoter is started and expression takes place. It is known that the expression strikingly increases by the binding of a complex of cAMP and CRP cAMP receptor protein to a specific site to be referred to as the positive regulation site existing in the positive control region. No example, however, has been known in which such a regulatory gene having both positive and negative control regions was used in the expression of a human SOD gene. Among these, the regulatory gene of colicin El gene is especially unique. The lac and gal genes undergo catabolite repression by glucose, and the expression in a medium containing glucose decreases. In contrast, colicin El gene shows a high expression in the presence of glucose A. Nakazawa Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 46, 1004 1010, 1972 . It is known that two binding sites exist for the cAMP CRP complex which participates in the positive control K. Shirabe et al. Nucleic Acids Res., 13, 4687 4698, 1985 . The regulatory gene of colicin El gene is considered as suitable for mass production of proteins. With the foregoing background, the present inventors extensively worked on the production of human SOD by the recombinant DNA technology, and have consequently found that a human Cu,Zn SOD gene can be efficiently expressed in a host by utilizing a regulatory gene having a positive regulation site. It is an object of this invention to provide a recombinant DNA having a human Cu Zn superoxide dismutase structural gene. Another object of this invention is to provide a recombinant DNA having a human Cu Zn superoxide dismutase structural gene downstream of a regulatory gene having a positive regulation site. Still another object of this invention is to provide a recombinant DNA which has a great ability to synthesize proteins even without imparting the function of increasing the protein synthesizing ability to a linker portion between the aforesaid structural gene and the regulatory gene. A further object of this invention is to proovide a process for producing the recombinant DNA of the inventon. A still further object of this invention is to provide a microorganism transformed with the recombinantDNA of the invention. Additional objects and advantages of this invention will become apparent from the following description. These objects and advantages of this invention are firstly achieved in accordance with this invention by a recombinant DNA comprising a regulatory gene having a positive regulation site and joined downstream thereof, a human Cu Zn superoxide dismutase structural gene. Figure 1 shows the base sequence of the regulatory gene region of colicin El gene. PB reprensents the RNA polymerase binding site and RS, the RNA polymerase recognition site. ThebO id arrow shows the transcription initiation point and the transcription direction. The broken underline shows the ribosome binding site. Met shows the position of the translation initiation codon.The two solid underlines show regions which participate in positive control. The restriction endonuclease DraI site is also shown. Figure 2 shows the base sequence of a human Cu ZnSOD cDNA structural gene region obtained from mRNA of the placenta, and the amino acid sequence determined from the base sequence. The two underlined portions are regions with which two synthetic DNA probes used in colony hydbridization hybridize. Figure 3 shows the base sequence of a syntheticDNA fragment, and the base sequences of chemically synthesized oligonucleotides. In the synthetic DNA fragment obtained by ligating oligonucleotides, the 5 terminus is the DraI cleavage terminus, and the 3 terminus is the TaqI cleavage terminus. The two asterisks show parts changed in base sequence from the base sequence shown in Figure 2, but the amino acid sequence remains unchanged. Figure 4 shows the outline of the process for preparing the recombinant DNA pUBE2 of this invention. Figure 5 shows an elution curve in SOD activity in column chromatography on ion exchange cellulose DE52.In Figure 5, the SOD activity is plotted in terms of percent inhibition of nitro blue tetrazolium NBT reduction.The straight line shows the concentration gradient of NaCl. In the present invention, mRNA used as a template for synthesis of a human Cu,Zn SOD cDNA is isolated from normal human tissues liver, placenta, kidneys, etc. .Separation of RNA from the tissues may be effected by utilizing known methods such as the phenol chloroform method, the guanidinium hot phenol method and the guanidinium cesium chloride method T. Naniatis. et al.,Molecular Cloning, 187 198, 1982, Cold Spring HarborLaboratory . Then, by using oligo dT cellulose, poly U Sepharose, etc., mRNA having a poly A tail is separated. The mRNA so obtained is an mRNA mixture containing human Cu,Zn SOD mRNA which may be directly used in the synthesis of cDNA. First, a single stranded cDNA is synthesized by using mRNA as a template and reverse transcriptase, and then a double stranded cDNA is synthesized by using reverse transcriptase or DNA polymerase. cDNA is obtained in a form inserted into a suitable vector. For this purpose, the dG dC or dA dT homopolymer joining method T. S. Nelson, Methods in Enzymology, 68, 41, 1979,Academic Press Inc. or the Okayama Berg method H. Okayama and P. Berg., Mol. Cell. Biol., 2, 161, 1082 can be utilized. When the amount of the desired mRNA is small in the mRNA mixture as in the present invention, the Okayama Berg method which has a high efficiency is preferred. DNAs and host organisms required for this method can be obtained from Pharmacia P. L.Biochemicals, Inc. under Catalog No 27 4750 01. The recombinant DNA so obtained is introduced, for instance, into E. coli x 1776 or DH 1 strain B. Low,Proc. Natl. Aca. Sci., , 160, 1968 M. Meselson and R.Yuan, Nature, 217, 1110, 1968 D Hanahan, J. Mol. Biol., 166, 557, 1983 to transform the host organism. Transformation may be carried out by a known method K.Shigesada, Cell Engineering, Vol. 2, No. 3, 616, 1983 or a method similar to it. The transformants are screened by drug resistance such as ampicillin resistance. An oligo nucleotide having a base sequence considered to correspond to the human Cu,Zn SOD gene is chemically synthesized and labelled with 32p. By using the labelled oligonucleotide as a probe, those transformants which show a positive signal are selected by a known colony hybridization method D. Hanahan, et. al., Methods in Enzyiology, 100, 333, 1983 . A plasmid DNAlis isolated by a conventional method from th eBétransformants. The basesequence of the cDNA portion is determined by the Maxam Gilbert method A. H.Maxam and W. Gilbert, Proc. Natl. Acad. SCi., 74, 560, 1977 or the dideoxy method J. Messing et al., NucleicAcids Res., 9, 309, 1981 , and the presence of the humanCu,Zn SOD cDNA is confirmed. For the purpose of confirmation, the amino acid sequence of Cu,Zn SOD isolated from human erythrocytes J. R. Jabusch, Biochemistry, 19, 2310, 1980 or the base sequence of cDNA obtained from nRNA which is isolated from an established cell line derived from patients with Down s syndrome L. Sherman et al., Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci., 80, 5465, 1983 may be referred to. The resulting human Cu,Zn SOD cDNA is joined to the downstream of a suitable regulatory gene. It should be noted however that an enzyme requiring O2 is known to exist in a living organism Yoshihiko Oyagi, Superoxide andMedicine, 58, 1981, Kyoritsu Shuppan K. K. . Accordingly, there is every possibility that the excessive production ofSOD having the action of scavenging O2 will cause a physiological trouble in the host organism. For the purpose of avoiding this possibility, it is preferred to grow the host cells in a condition where the expression of the gene is repressed, and thereafter to derepress and allow the gene to express in the host cells and produce large amounts ofSOD. The colicin El gene present on the plasinid Col El separated from E. coli is a gene which codes for the synthesis of colicin El protein, and in a normal condition, its expression is repressd by the binding of a represser protein to the operator. But when the colicin El gene is subjected to a treatment which damages DNA, such as ultraviolet irradiation, mitomycin C treatment or Nalidixic acid treatment, this repression is released, and the induction of the gene takes place whereby colicin El protein is produced in a large amount. This is generally called negative regulation. In addition, the colicin El gene has positive regulation K. Shirabe et al., Biochemistry, Vol. 56, No. 8, 1082, 1984 . Thus, the colicin El gene has a unique regulation of gene expression, and at the time of induction, colicin El protein is produced in very large amounts by the effect of the positive regulation as well.Furthermore, the colicin El protein has an antimicrobial function against E. coli, and can be regarded as a protein which is not required for the normal growth of the E. coli cells. In view of its nature, the expression of the colicin El gene during a normal period is strictly repressed. Hence, the utilization of the regulatory gene of the colicin El gene is very advantageous to the present invention. Col El DNA can be obtained, for example, fromPharmacia P. L. Biochemicals, Inc. under Catalog No.27 4914 01. The base sequence of the regulatory gene of the colicin El gene consisting of a region participating in positive regulation, a promoter operator region, and a ribosome binding region has alreay ben reported Y. Ebina,Gene, 15, 119, 1981 . The regulatory gene of the colicinEl gene in the present invention contains the base sequence from No. 140 to No. 78 in Figure 1 as an essential segment. In joining the human Cu,Zn SOD cDNA to the downstream side of the regulatory gene of the colicin El gene, ligation in such a way as to produce so called fused proteins can be relatively easily carried out by utilizing cleavage sites of restriction endonucleases. However, when a portion derived from the colicin El protein has a length larger than a certain limit, it is very probable that when administered to a human, the fused proteins will exhibit iamunogenicity antigenicity . Desirably, therefore, theN terminus amino acid codon of the human Cu,Zn SOD is joined immediately after the translation initiation codon ATG of the colicin El gene. However, neither of these genes has a suitable cleavage site of a restriction endonuclease which meets this desire.It is possible therefore to cut out both DNA fragments in a form having the required portion deleted by restriction endonucleases, and substitute a synthetic DNA fragment for the deleted portion. The synthetic DNA fragment can be obtained by chemically synthesizing oligonucleotides by, for example, the solid phase triester method. K. Miyoshi et al., Nucl.Acids Res., 8, 5507, 1980 and ligating them with, for example, T4 DNA ligase. The synthetic DNAfragment does not necessarily have to reproduce the base sequence of the original deleted portion. It is well known that degeneracy exists in amino acid codons, and the frequency of codon usage differs from species to species of living organisms. Hence, so long as the amino acid sequence remain unchanged, any desired codons can be selected in the preparation of synthetic DNA fragments. If, however, codons having a high frequency of use in the host organism are selected, an increase in the expression of the gene can be expected.With regard to the regulatory gene region of the colicin El gene, it is preferred to reproduce the original base sequence in the synthetic DNA fragment, but a change in base sequence which will lead to an increase in the expression of the gene may be made. The desired recombinant DNA can be obtained by correctly inserting a DNA fragment containing the regulatory gene of colicin El gene, a synthetic DNA fragment and a human Cu,Zn SOD structural gene fragment into a vector capable of being autonomously replicated. These DNA fragments can be ligated, for example, by T4 DNA ligase.There is no restriction on the order of ligation of the DNA fragments so long as the structure of the finally obtained recombinant DNA is the desired one. Any vectors can be used which can be replicated in host microorganisms. When the host is E. coli, pBR322 is frequently used as the vector. The resulting recombinant DNA is introduced into a host micoorganism for the vector to transform the host.In the present invention. E. coli is used as the host microorgfanism, but other microorganisms such as Bacillus sustitlis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae may also be used so long as the regulatory gene, particularly the regulatory gene of colicin El gene, can function. For example, W3110, 20S0 and C6OOS strains of E. coli may be used. W3110 strain is especially preferred. W3110 strain is a X , F strain derived from a wild strain X , F of E. coli K12 and is the same as the wild strain in auxotrophy, etc. B. J. Bachmann, Bacteriological Reviews, 36, 525, 1972 . Transformants are selected by, for example, tetracycline resistance, and in a customary manner, the plasmid DNA is separated. By analyzing the restriction map, the transformants are secondarily screened. The desired transformants are selected by determining the ability to produce human Cu,Zn SOD during induction. SOD activity may be measured, for example, by utilizing a method involving using cytochrome C xanthine xanthine oxidase J. M. McCord and I. Fridovich, J. Biol.Chem., 244, 6049 , and a method involving using nitro blue tetrazolium NBT rivoflavin C. Beauchamp and I. Fridovich,Anal. Biochem., 10, 44, 276, 1971 . The NBT rivoflavin method is simple and convenient because it can also be utilized in staining protein activities after electrophoresis. When E. coli is the host, human Cu,Zn SOD produced from the recombinant DNA and Mn SOD and Fe SOD produced by the host chromosomes exist as a mixture in the transformants. The enzyntatic actions of these SODs are the same but they can be distinguished from each other in that the activity of Cu,Zn SOD is inhibited by 1 2 mM CN ions whereas the activities of Mn SOD and Fe SOD are not inhibited under the same conditions.These three kinds ofSOD differ from each other in molecular weight or isoelectic point, and therefore can be separated by electrophoresis, or ion exchange or gel filtration column chromatography. The resulting microorganism transformed with the recombinant DNA having the human Cu,Zn SOD structural gene downstream of the regulatory gene, particularly the regulatory gene of colicin El gene is grown for a predetermined period of time under conditions suitable for the growth of the host organism and then by induction, large quantities of human Cu,Zn SOD are produced. E. coli transformants may be grown in a known culture medium such as L medium or M9 medium containing glucose and Casamino acid. The cultivation is carried out usually at a temperature of 15 to 43 0C for a period of 2 to 24 hours, as required with aeration and agitation. Induction is carried out by adding an inducer, for example a drug such as mitomycin C or Nalidixic acid to the culture during the logarithmic growth period or applying ultraviolet irradiation to it. After the induction, the cells are harvested and ruptured by known methods, and proteins having humanCu,Zn SOD activity are purified from the cells by methods that are usually known. As a result, human Cu, Zn SOD can be obtained. The purification can be carried out by, for example, heat treatment, salting out, concentration, dialysis, ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, chromatofocusing, electrophoresis, high performance liquid chromatography and affinity chromatography in suitable combinations. The following Examples illustrate the present invention more specifically. Needless to say, the scope of the present invention is in no way limited to these Examples. EXAMPLE 1 Isolation of mRNA from human placenta The human placenta obtained by normal parturition was minced, and rapidly frozen by liquid nitrogen. The frozen placenta was homogenized in the presence of liquid nitrogen to obtain a powdery placental tissue sample. Five milliliters, per gram of the tissue sample, of a guanidinium solution 6M guanidinium thiocyanate, 5mM sodium citrate, 0.5 sodium N lauroylsarcosinate, 0.1M 2 mercaptoethanol was added to the tissue sample, and the mixture was quickly homogenized by means of a disperser.The homogenate was passed three times through a 22G xl 14 syringe to shear the DNA. 5.7M CsCl containing 0.lM EDTA, pH 7.5 was put in a centrifugal polyaromer tube and two times its volume of the homogenate was overlaid on it. The homogenate was centrifuged in a rotor Hitach RPS40T at 25 0C and 32,000 rpm for 17 hours. After the centrifugation, the supernatant was carefully removed, and the RNA precipitated at the bottom was washed with a small amount of ethanol to remove CsCl, and then dissolved in 1 ml of water. NaC1 was added to the solution to a concentration of 0 2M, and the solution was again precipitated with ethanol. The RNA was dissolved in 0.5 ml of lOmM Tris HCl pH 7.5 1 mM EDTA to be refered to as TE , and mRNA was isolated by oligo dT cellulose Type 3, Catalog No. 20003 Collaborative Research, Inc. .

Then, 0.5 ml of 1M NaCl was added and the solution was applied to an oligo dT cellulose column bed volume 1.5 ml column inside diameter 7 mm equilibrated with TE 0.5M NaCl. The column was washed with TE 0.SM NaCl, and mRNA was eluted with TE.Fractions having an ultraviolet absorption at 254 nm were recovered, and NaCl was added to 0.2M. mRNA was then precipitated with 2.5 volumes of ethanol. The precipitate was washed with 75 ethanol, and then lyophilized. From 5 g of the placental tissue sample, 50 micrograms of mRNA was obtained.

The cells were suspended in 140 ml of a TfbI solution 30mM KOCOCH3, mM RbCl, 1OmM CaCl2, 50mM MnC12, 15 glycerol adjusted to pH 5.8 with 0.2M acetic acid .The suspension was left to stand at 0 0C for 5 minutes and then centrifuged to collect the cells. The cells were suspended in 32 ml of aTfbII solution l0mM MOPS, 75mM CaC12, l0mM RbCl, 15 glycerol adjusted to pH 6.5 with KOH . The suspension was divided into 200 microliter portions and instantaneously frozen in a dry ice ethanol bath. The frozen products were stored at 800C. The frozen cell suspension was left to stand at room temperature, and when it was melted, left to stand at 0 C for 15 minutes. Twenty microliters of the DNA solution prepared ln Example 12 was added and the mixture was left to stand at 0 C for 30 minutes. Thermal shock was applied to the mixture by heating it at 42 0C for 90 seconds. The mixture was then placed on an ice bath for 2 minutes, and 800 microliters of the SOB medium was added. The mixture was gently shaken at 37OC for 1 hour. The cells were then subjected to colony hybridization. EXAMPLE 4 Synthesis of synthetic DNA probes As probes in colony hybridization, two oligonucleotides having the following sequences 5 TTCGTCGCCAT3 undecamer 5 TTATTGGGCGATCCCAATT3 nonadecamer were synthesized. They had sequences complementary to the base sequences the underlined portions in Figure 2 corresponding to the N terminus and C terminus of humanCu,Zn SOD. The synthesis was carried out by the solid phase triester method. The undecamer probe was synthesized by successively coupling protected nucleotide dimer blocksCA, GC, TC, OG and TT all products of Bachem Inc. with 10 mg of a polystyrene support a product of Wako PureChemicals, Cho., Ltd. Catalog No. 160 11681 .A reaction of removing the 5 terminus protective group was carried out by using a 1M solution of ZnBr2 in dichloromethaneisopropanol 85 15 . The coupling reaction was carried outr at 45 0C for 15 minutes in 0.15 ml of a pyridine solution containing 0.1M dimer block and mesitylene sulfonyl 3nitrotriazole in an amount of 3 equivalents to the dimer block. The unreacted reactive groups were blocked with acetic anhydride, and the next coupling reaction was carried out. When the final coupling reaction was terminated, the mixture was reacted at 40 C for 20 hours in 3000 microliters of 0.5M tetramethyl guanidium 2 pyridine aldoximate to cause the oligonucleotide to leave the polystyrene support. Protective groups other than the 5 terminus protective group were removed by using 28 aqueous ammonium. Then, the product was subjected to high performance liquid chromatography using an reverse phase column a proudct ofToyo Soda Industry Co., Ltd. ODS 120A, 4.6 mm in diameter x 25 cm using 0.5 ammonium formate buffer by the acetonitrile concentration gradient elution method. An oligonucleotide peak eluted at an acetonitrile concentration of about 30 was recovered, and reacted at 25 0C for 30 minutes in 80 acetic acid to remove the 5 terminus protective group. The product was again purified on a reverse phase column, and a peak eluted at an acetonitrile concentration of 17 was recovered and used as a probe for colony hybridization. The nonadecamer probe was synthesized in the same manner as described above. The yield of the undecamer probe was 41 , and the yield of the nonadecamer probe was 6 . EXAMPLE 5 Selection of the recombinant DNA by colony hybridization A sterilized nitrocellulose filer was placed on an L agar plate containing 100 micrograms ml of ampicillin, and the cells obtained in Example 3 was spread on the filter and grown at 37 0C. When the diameter of the colonies became about 0.1 mm, the colonies were transferred on two separate nitrocellulose filter. The filters were placed on an L agar plate containing 250 micrograms ml of chloramphenicol, and incubated at 37 0C for 24 hours. The colonies on the filters were lysed with 0.5M NaOH and neutralized, and then heated at 65 C under reduced pressure for 2 hours to fix the DNA on the filters. The filters were immersed in 500 ml of 5X Denhardt s solution having 0.5 SDS and l0mM EDTA, and slowly shaken at 680C for 6 hours. The filters were then immersed in a solution consisting of 5X SET, 5X Denhardt s solution, 0.1 SDS, 250 micrograms ml of denatured E. coli DNA, and 10 micrograms ml of 32p labelled synthetic DNA probe to perform hybridization for 48 hours at 28 0C for the undecamer probe and 400C for the nonadecamer probe.The 32p labelled probes were found by using T4 polynucleotide kinase a product ofTakara Shuzo Co., Ltd. Catalog No. 2020A to have a species 9 fic activity of 1.1 x 10 cpmJmicrogra and 9.4 x 109 cpm microgram, respectively, The SET was composed of 0.15S NaCl, 30mM Tris HCl pH8 and lmM EDTA, and the Denhardt s solution as composed of 0.02 Ficoll, 0.028 polyvinyl pyrrolidone and 0.02 BSA. The filters wre washed, and autoradiographed. Colonies which gave positive signals to both of the probes were selected, and cultivated.The plasmid DNA was isolated and the base sequence of cDNA was examined by the Maxam Gilbert method and the dideoxy method. As a result, only one colony harboring plasmid pSOD2 having the whole region of the human Cu,Zn SQD strucutural gene was obtained from more than 300 thousand colonies. Figure 2 shows the base sequence of the humanCu,Zn SOD structural gene and its amino acid sequence determined on the basis of the base sequence. When the human Cu,Zn SOD so obtained was compared with the human Cu,Zn SOD which Sherman et al. supra isolated from an established cell line derived from patients with Down s syndrome, it was found that the codon for the 54th threonine is not ACG but ACA. But the amino acid sequence was the same for both of these humanCu, Zn SOD genes. Jabush et al. supra reported the amino acid sequence of Cu, Zn SOD derived from human erythrocytes.A comparison of the human Cu,Zn SOD obtained in this example showed that the 17th amino acid is not SER but ILE, and the 98th amino acid is not VA1 but SER. Elsewhere, the 26th amino acid is not ASP but ASN the 49th amino acid is not GLN but GLU the 52nd amino acid is not ASN but ASP and the 53rd amino acid is not ASP but ASN. These four additional amino acids are difficult to identify because of the technical problems in amino acid analysis, and may considered as substantially indentical for the two humanCu,Zn SOD genes. It was therefore confirmed from the foregoing that the human Cu,Zn SOD structural gene existed on plasmid pSOD2. EXAMPLE 6 Construction of recombinant DNA 1 Isolation of the regulatory gene fragment of of colicin El gene and its insertion into a vector Ten micrograms of Col El DNA was digested with 8 units of DraI a product of Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd. CatalogNo. 1037 at 37 C for 12 hours in 50 microliters of a buffer consisting of l0mM Tris HCl pH 7.5 , 7mM Mac12, 60mM NaCl, and 7mM 2 mercaptoethanol. DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation, and then digested with 10 units ofStul a product of Nippon Gene Co., Ltd. at 370C for 12 hours in 50 microliters of a buffer consisting of 100mM NaCl, l0mM Tris HCl pH 7.5 , l0mM MgC12 and 6mM 2 mercaptoethanol.The digestion product was subjected to 5 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and a 340 bp StuI DraI fragment was recovered by the electrophoretic elution method. Separately, 10 micrograms of pBR322 DNA was digested with 13 units of DraI at 37 0C for 12 hours under the same conditions as used in the digestion of Col El DNA.The digestion product was subjected to 1.2 agarose gel electrophoresis, and a DNA fragment having a size of 3651 bp was recovered in the same way as above. This fragment was reacted with 0.2 unit of alkaline phosphatase a product of Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd. CAtalog NO. 2120A at 250C for 2 hours to remove the phosphate group at the 5 terminus. DNA was recovered by phenol treatment, ether extraction and ethanol precipitation. The 34Q bp Col El. fragment 0.1 microgram and 2 micrograms of the alkaline phosphatase treated 3651 bp pBR322 fragment were ligated with 1 unit of T4 DNA ligase at 150 for 12 hours using a ligation buffer consiting of 66MM Tris HCl pH7.6 , 6.6 mM MgCl2, 10mM DTT, 0.4mM adenosine triphosphate ATP . The resulting DNA was introduced into E. coli DHl strain in the same way as in Example 3. Tetracycline resistance transformants were selected, and the plasmid DNA was isolated. A plasmid pAOK 1 having the 340 bp Col El Stul Dral fragment inserted into the 3651 bp DraI bp fraglent of pBR322 was obtained as a result of analysis of the restriction endonuclease cleavage map see Figure 4 . In the pAOK 1, transcription from the regulatory gene of colicin El gene was in a direction reverse to the transcription direction of the tetracycline resistance gene. 2 Isolation of the SOD structural gene fragment Ten micrograms of pSOD 2 DNA was digested with units of AluI a product of Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd. CatalogNo. 1004A at 37 C for 12 hours in 50 microliters of a buffer consisting of 10mM Tris HCl pB 7.5 , 7mM MgCl2, 20mM NaCl and 7mM 2 mercaptoethanol. DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation, and digested with 3 units of TaqI a product of Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd. Catalog No. 1092B at 65 C for 12 hours in 50 ml of a buffer consisting of 10mM Tris ECl pH 7.5 , 10mM MgCl, 100mM NaCl and 10mM 2 mercaptoethanol. The digestion product was subjected to 5 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and a 440 bp fragment was recovered in the same way as in 1 above. The Taqi cleavage site existed in a codon corresonding to the 20th amino acid of SOD, i.e. phenylalanine, and the AluI cleavage site existed in a 3 non translational region. 3 Preparation of a synthetic DNA fragment The required portion having a size of 84 bp which was deleted in the 340 bp Col El fragment and SOD structural gene fragment was divided into 12 oligonucleotides as shown in Figure 3, and synthesized by the method shown inExample 4. The oligonucleotides were each labelled with 2132p using gamma 32 p ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The oligonucleotides 1 to 6 were mixed, and the oligonucleotides 7 to 12 were also mixed. They were ligated by T4 DNA liagase. Specifically, the oligonucleotides were mixed each in an amount of 40 pmoles. The mixture in the form of an aqueous solution was heated at 90 0C for 3 minutes, and then rapidly cooled.The mixture was left to stand at 19 0C for 8 hours after adding a buffer having the same composition as in the ligation shown in 1 above. Then, T4 DNA ligase was added, and the mixture was reacted at 19 0C for 24 hours. The reaction product was subjected to 15 polyacrylamige gel electrophoresis and then autoradiographed to detect DNA bands. A gel was sliced from the band having a size corresponding to the desired size. The gel slice was crushed, and 0.3 ml of TE buffer was added. The mixture was left to stand at 37 0C for 12 hours to extract DNA from the gel. The DNA solution was centrifuged. The supernatant was recovered, precipitated with ethanol, and then dried under reduced pressure. The two DNA fragments so obtained were dissolved in 15 microliters of water, and mixed. The mixture was heated at 45 0C, then left to stand at 19 0C for 2 hours, and ligated with T4 DNA ligase. The ligation product was worked up in the same way as above except that electrophoresis was carried out using 10 polyacrylamide gel. As a result, a synthetic DNA fragment having a size of 84 bp was obtained. In the synthetic DNA fragment shown in Figure 3, a codon corresponding to the 12th amino acid, glycine, is changed from GGC used in the original cDNA to GGT, and the codon for the 15th glutamine is changed from CAG to CAA.The codons GGT and CAA are used in a host organism more frequently than the codons GGC and CAG. 4 Construction of recombinant DNA pAOK 1 DNA was cleaved with Dral, and then treated with alkaline phosphatase. 0.38 pmole of this fragment, 0.56 pmole of the synthetic DNA fragment and 0.56 pmole of the SOD structural gene fragment were mixed, and ligated with 1 unit of T4 DNA ligase at 40C for 2 hours and then at 15 0C for 12 hours. Transformants were selected for tetracycline resistance, and cultured. The recombinantDNA was isolated. The resulting recombinant DNA was digested with TaqI, and then subjected to 5 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The desired recombinant DNA was cleaved with TaqI into 8 fragments having a size of 1307, 1115, 498, 475, 368, 315, 312 and 141 bp.Two hundred transformants were examined, and recombinant DNAs pUBEl, pUBE2, pUBE3 and pUBE4 having the same electrophoretic pattern as the desired redombinant DNA were obtained. EXAMPLE 7 Induction of SOD synthesis The four transformants harboring the recombinantDNAs obtained in Example 6 and a transform ant harboring pAOK 1 was induced with mitomycin C, and their ability to produce human Cu,Zn SOD was measured. The transformant harboring pAOK 1 was selected for tetracycline resistance after introduction of pAOK 1 DNA into W3110 in the same way as in Example 3, and used herein as a comparison to deterline the amount of Mn SOD and Fe SOD prodded from genes on the host chromosomes. The transformants were each inoculated in 20 ml of M9 medium containing 0.3 Casamino acid a product ofDifco Laboratories , 0.4 glucose and 10 micrograms ml of tetracycline, and grown with shaking at 37 0C until the OD660 of the culture reached 0.4. The culture was centrifuged at 4 0C and 8,000 rpm for 10 minutes to harvest the cells. The cells were then suspended in 20 ml of a freshly prepared medium of the aforesaid composition, and mitomycinC a product of Kyowa Fermentation Co., Ltd. was added in a concentration of 2 micrograms ml. The mixture was incubated at 379e for 2 hours to induce synthesis of SOD. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 4 0C and 8,000 rpm for 10 minutes, washed with 10 ml of physiological saline, and suspended in 3 ml of physiological saline. The suspension was sonicated to rupture the cells, and centrifuged at 4 0C and 12,000 rpm for 15 minutes. The supernantant crude extract was recovered, and its SOD activity was measured by the method of Beauchamp et al. supra . Specifically, 10 microliters of the crude extract was added to 3 ml of a solution consisting of 5.6x10 5M NBT a product of Wako Pure Chemicals, Co. Catalog No. 148 01991 , lx10 2M M methionine, 5.85xl0 6 M rivoflavin and 50mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.8 . The mixture was irradiated with light from a 18W fluorescent lamp for 2 minutes, and the absorbance OD at 560 nm of the mixture was measured. At the same time, the absorbance at 560 nm of a sample containing 10 microliters of water in place of the crude extract was also measured, and the ratio of inhibition of NBT reduction based on the degree of NBT reduction of this sample was measured. The ratio of inhibition of NBT reduction has a positive correlation with the SOD activity, and the higher the inhibition ratio, the higher the SOD activity.Furthermore, the above measurement was repeated except that 2mM of KCN was further added.The effect of CN ions was examined. The results are shown in Table 1.

The relative activity value is a value obtained by correcting the effect of the amount of protein. The transformants harboring the recombinant DNAs showed 1.4 to 2 times as high SOD activity as W3ll0 pAOK 1 . The increased activity was due to human Cu,Zn SOD.This is clearly seen from the fact that in the presence ofCN ions, they showed nearly the same level of activity.The presence of CN increased OD560, but this effect can be ignored by comparing the inhibition ratios. E. coli W3110 pUBE 2 which showed the highest activity in this example was deposited in Fermentation Research Institute, Tsukuba,Japan under deposit number FERM BP 634 on October 12, 1984. EXAMPLE 8 The results of Example 7 demonstrate the production of human Cu,Zn SOD, but a confirmatory test was further carried out. As a standard sample for comparison,Cu,Zn SOD a product of Sigma Chemical Co. Catalog No.S7006 prepared from human erythrocytes was used. This standard sample had a specific activity of 3,000 units mg of protein. A crude extract of W3110 pUBE2 was subjected to electrophoresis by the gel disc electrophoretic method Methods of Basic Experiments in Proteins and Enzymes , edited by Horio and Yamashita, 282, 1981, published byNankodo , and the gel after electrophoresis was stained.The acrylamide concentration was 15 for a separated gel and 4.36 for a concentrated gel, and the gels were prepared by chemical polymerization using N,N,N ,N tetramethyl ethylenediamine TEMPED A Tris glycine pH 8.3 buffer was used for the electrophoresis. The gel after the electrophoresis was immersed for 20 minutes in a 2.45x10 3 M NBT solution in a light shielded condition, and then immersed for 15 minutes in a solution consisting of 0.028M TEMED, 2.8x105M rivoflavin and O.036M potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.8 . Then, light was irradiated onto the gel for 8 minutes using a 18W fluorescent lamp.By the light irradiation, the gel turned from transparent yellow to semi transparent dark bluish violet, but a band of SOD protein remains uncolored and looked transparent. 0.38 microgram of SOD of Sigma ChemicalCo. and the same amount of the crude extract of W3ll0 pUBE 2 containing human Cu,Zn SOD the total amount of proteins was 131 micrograms showed protein bands having the same mobility and the same transparency with no color change, and it could be confirmed that both are substantially the same. 164 micrograms of the crude extract of W3110 pAOK 1 was also subjected to electrophoresis. But no band havingSOD activity was detected and it was found that under these conditions, no detectable amounts of Mn SOD and FeO SOD were produced. Next, activity inhibition by an anti humanCu,Zn SOD antibody to be referred to simply as tEhe antibody hereinafter was examined. 1.5 mg of human Cu,Zn SOD a product of Sigma Chemical Co. was subcutaneouly injected to rabbits together with Freund s complete adjuvant.The same injection was given 16 days and 18 days later.Six days after the final immunization, the blood was drawn from the animals, and the antisera were separated. After heat treatment at 56 C for 30 minutes, IgG was isolated by chromatography on a column of protein A Sepharose C1 4B Pharmacia P. L. Biochemicals, Inc. Catalog No. 170780 01 . The bed volume was 2 ml, and the column was eluted with lM acetic acid. The eluate was assayed by theOuchterlony method. As a result, the isolated IgG formed precipitation arcs with human Cu, Zn SOD Sigma ChemicalCo. , but showed no precipitation arcs with Cu,Zn SOD a product of Sigma Chemical Co. Catalog No. 58254 derived from bovine erythrocytes and the crude extract of W3110. It was determined therefore that the isolated IgG was an antibody specific to human Cu,Zn SOD. Fifty microliters of the antibody was added to 10 microliters each of the crude extracts of W3110 pUBE 2 andW3110 pAOK 1 , and reacted at 40C for 4 hours. The same reaction was carriedTout except that 50 microliters of physiological saline was added instead of the antibody.After the reaction, the activity was measured in the same way as in Example 7. The results are shown in Table 2.

This because only the effect of inhibiting NBT reduction by human Cu,Zn SOD was cancelled by the addition of the antibody. The foregoing results led to the confirmation that the transformant W3l10 pUBE 2 harboring recombinantDNA pUBE 2 produced human Cu,Zn SOD. In the next example, human Cu,Zn SOD was produced by using these transformants. EXAMPLE 9 Production of human Cu,Zn SOD W3110 pUBE 2 was inoculated in 5 liters of M9 medium containing 0.3 Casamino acid, 0.4 glucose and 10 micrograms ml tetracycline, and grown with shaking at 37 C until the OD660 of the culture reached 0.4. Then, in the same was as in Example 7, induction was carried out at 37 C for 2 hours. Centrifugation gave 20 g of wet cells. The cells were washed with physiological saline and then suspended in 5mM Tris HCl pH 7.5 . The suspension was sonicated and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4 C to give 155 ml of a crude extract. The crude extract was heat treated at 60 C for 3 minutes. The resulting precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 ppm for 15 minutes at 4 C to obtain 142 ml of the supernatant. Streptolycin sulfate was added to the supernatant to a concentration of 2.5 W V . The resulting precipitate was centrifuged in the same manner as above to obtain 140 ml of the supernatant. The supernatant was precipitated with ammonium sulfate. Fractions precipitated with 50 90 saturated ammonium sulfate were collected, dialyzed and chromatographed on an ion exchange cellulose DE52 a product of Whatman Ltd. column bed volume 43.3 ml inside column diameter 2.1 cm . The column was eluted with NaCl having a concentration gradient from 0 to 0.2M. The elution pattern of the SOD activity is shown in Figure 5. three SOD activity peaks were detected, and the second peak fraction whose activity disappeared in the presence of 2mM KCN was recovered. The activity measurement shown in Figure 5 was fot the purpose of detecting the peak fractions. Hence, a considerably large amount of SOD was added, and the accuracy of quantification is low. It is to be noted therefore that the ratio of the SOD peak areas in Figure 5 does not exactly represent the ratio of the total activities of the three SODs. The second peak fraction was concentrated by ultrafiltration, and chromatographed on a column ofSephacryl S 200 a product of Pharmacia Fine Chemicals,Co. Catalog No. 17 0871 01 bed volume 315 ml inside column diameter 2.1 cm to recover an active fraction of human Cu,Zn SOD. This fraction was lyophilized.

EXAMPLE 10 Production in a jar fermentor One hundred liters of the same culture medium as in Example 9 was charged into a 200 liter jar fermentor equipped with stirring vanes. W3110 pUBE 2 was inoculated in the medium, and grown at 37OC and 200 rpm with aeration and agitation until the OD660 of the culture reached 0.4.Then, 2 liters of an aqueous solution containing 30 Na2HPO4, 15 KH2PO4, 2.5 NaCl and 5 NH4Cl, 1 liter of a 40 aqueous solution of glucose and 500 ml of a 0ffi94 aqueous solution of mitomycin C were added to the culture for induction, and the cells were further incubated at 37 0C for 2 hours. The culture was centrifuged at 20,000 for 3 hours in a sharpless type centrifuge to harvest 344 g of wet cells. The cells were suspended in 3 liters of 10mM triethanolamine buffer pH 7.0 and the cells were ruptured by a Dyno mill, fDliowed by centrifugation at 9,000 rpm for 60 minutes. The supernatant was recovered, and a part of it was subjected to 12.58 SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein bands were stained with CoomassieBrilliant Blue. The density of each of the protein bands was measured by a densitometer. It was found that the proportion of human Cu,Zn SOD in the entire proteins was 12 . For identification of the band of the human Cu,Zn SOD protein, the purified SOD obtained in Example 9 was used.
