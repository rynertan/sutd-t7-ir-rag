# Computerized tomographic scanner with shaped radiation filter.

## Abstract
The invention comprises a shaped filter D and a fil ter correction circuitry G for computerized tomographic scanners. The shaped filter D is a generally U shaped block 200 of filter material which is adapted to be mount ed between the source B of radiation and the scan circle 10 . The U shaped block 200 has a parabolic recess 204 . The filter material may be berryllium, aluminum, sul phur, calcium, titanium, erbium, copper, and compounds including oxides and alloys thereof. The filter correction circuit G comprises a first filter correction profile adding circuit 50 for adding a first scaler valve to each in tensity valve in a data line. The data line is operated on by a beam hardness correction polynominal. After the beam hardness polynomial correction operation F , a second fil ter correction circuit 80 adds a second filter correction profile consisting of a table of scalor values, one corres ponding to each intensity reading in the data line.
