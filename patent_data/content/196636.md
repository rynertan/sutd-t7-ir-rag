The components may also be directly plugged into female sockets on a jack panel for performing experiments for training. The connection between the components or the modules in such known apparatus are made by switchboard wires plugged in as needed , short circuit plugs and rigid connectors. Such connections can be made permanent by soldering and made changable by plugging in and out the connections. Examples of this state of art are US patent 4,112,593, German disclosure letter 23 27 323, German disclosure letter 21 44 688, German disclosure letter 29 39 083, Japanese publication letter 58174985, USSR invention No. su 875446 and the US experimental apparatus consisting of Model ET 2100A Breadboard.However, none of the above mentioned apparatus simultaneously show the required simplicity of construction, convenience of operation and possibility to compose electrical circuits by intuition.In view of the above, the object of the invention is to provide a teaching and demonstrating apparatus for electrical circuits having with respect to the state of art a simplified construction, more convenience in operation and allowing the composition of electrical circuits by intuition. This object is solved according to the invention as claimed in claim 1.A preferred embodiment of the invention is comprised of a common jack panel, a set of plug socket units and a set of circuit cards, where the jack panel comprises a printed board having various conductive paths, each of the circuitcards having printed thereon an experimental circuit, and all elements and components shown in the circuit cards are accompanied with apertures which are in alignment with the Aper tures of the jack panel which in turn are provided for holding the prongs of the plugged in elements and or components whereby electrical connections between the prongs of the plugged in units and the conductive paths of said printed boards are formed.The complete electrical circuit including the connections between the elements and components can be accomplished by simply laying an appropriate circuit card on the jack panel and plugging in all the required plug socket units into the appropriate apertures shown on the circuitcard. Thereby, experiments with such circuit can be started promptly. No soldering, wiring or switching is needed.Further embodiments and advantages of the invention can be taken from the following description of the embodiments when read in connection with the drawings. In the drawings Fig. la shows an exploded view of the apparatus with plug socket units, circuit card and jack panel Fig. ib shows the assembled jack panel Figs. 2 7 show examples of electrical circuits as printed on circuit cards Fig. 8 shows an example of a printed board with the con ductive paths printed thereon Fig. 9 shows a female socket before and after its assem bly with the jack panel Fig. 10a shows a plug unit having two prongs, the unit be ing shown in side elevation and partly in section Fig. 1Ob shows a top plan view on the unit of Fig. 1Oa as plugged into the jack panel Fig. 11a shows a plastic body as a part of a unit Fig. 11b shows a section of Fig. ila along the line V V Fig. 11c shows a plan view from the bottom of the plastic body of Fig ila including a plastic snap piece Fig. 12a shows a side elevation of a prong used in the plastic body of Fig. lia Fig. 12b shows another side elevation of the prong of Fig. 12a Fig. 13a shows a side elevation of the plastic snap piece Fig. 13b shows an end elevation of the snap piece of Fig. 13a Fig. 13c shows a bottom elevation of the snap piece of Fig. 13a Fig. 14a shows a plug unit having three prongs, the unit being shown in sied elevation and partly in sec tion andFig. 14b shows a plan view on the unit of Fig. 14a.The teaching and demonstrating apparatus for electrical circuits is composed of a jack panel 1, a set of plug socket units 2 and a set of circuit cards 3, the jack panel 1 being common to a plurality of circuit cards. The jack panel 1 is composed of a printed board 4r a face board 5 and a base plate 6. The printed board 4 and the face board 5 are fixed to the base plate 6 for example by means of screws. The face board 5 consists of insulating material and is provided with apertures which are in alignment with the respective female sockets 7 Fig. 9 on the printed board 4. The printed board 4 as used in the jack panel 1 is shown inFig. 8. In order to make the printed board 4 to be adapted for the common use for various circuits as printed on the circuit cards 3, and in order to eliminate the possibility of interference of the experimental circuits with each other, and, furthermore, to ensure the mutual independence as well as the possibility to understand the circuit diagrams clearly and to design the circuit diagrams with intuition, the arrangement of the apertures of the printed board 4 must be designed in a systematical step by step way instead of a matrix array design. By designing the conductive paths on the printed board 4 in the above way, a larger number of components may be accomodated on the jack panel 1 while the space needed by the experimental circuits is kept at a minimum.The system of designing the conductive paths on the printed board is now explained by way of example with reference to Figs. 2, 3 and 7. In these figures, Fig. 2 shows a circuit with the emitter grounded directly, Fig. 3 a circuit with the emitter grounded through a resistor Rel, Re2, and Fig. 7 an emitter follower with the collector connective to the positive terminal of the power supply. The apertures in the jack panel 1 for the prongs of the transistor units have to be at different positions for the three circuits. In this way no short circuit plugs are needed in the experiments, and each of the abovementioned circuits may be accomplished on the common jack panel 1. Some of the apertures in the jack panel may be used in common for building up different circuits in order to reduce the space taken up by the printed board.Therefore, it is possible to conduct various experiments on one and the same common jack panel with electrical circuits containing different components. In particular, different fundamental circuits as preamplifiers, power amplifiers, LC and DC sinuidal and non sinuidal oscillators, rectification circuits and filter circuits as well as power supply circuits may be embodied. Also a variety of biasing circuits for the active components of the above mentioned circuits, any kinds of couplings between various stages of the above mentioned circuits as well as components of the same kind having different values may be used or exchanged in order to find out about the influence of such changes on the function of the experimental circuit. All the various circuits and modifications can be built up by means of plug socket units which are stored in a box. The components, e.g. resistors, capacitors, diodes and the like are marked with a conventional colour code.Figs. 2 7 show different circuit cards on which individual transistor circuits are printed. The components of the circuits are marked as resistors R, capacitors C, transistorsT, diodes D and the like as usual in the design of electronic circuits. In these figures, also the positions of the apertures in the face board 5 and the printed board 4 of the jack panel 1 are marked. The apertures are provided with numbers which correspond to the numbers shown in Fig. 8 pertaining to the positions where the conductive paths of the printed board 4 are contacted. If, for example, the transistor T Fig. 2 is plugged into the jack panel t in the positiion indicated in Fig. 2, the prongs of this unit make contact with the point 161, 158 and 159 of the printed board d as indicated in Fig. 8.The resistors, capacitors and diodes are contained in plug socket units having two prongs, and the transistors, FETs and solid state potentiometers are contained in plugfsocket units having three prongs. The plug socket units can also have a larger number of prongs in case integrated circuits or the like are built into the units. For example, a plug socket unit containing an operational amplifier would have an elongated or cylindrical form and contain eight prongs for making the necessary connection to the operational amplifier.In the following specification the details of the plug socket units are explained. As can be seen in Fig. 9, the female sockets 7 are riveted on the printed board 4 with copper ri vets Furthermore, the female sockets 7 are connected to the conductive circuit paths of the printed board 4 by soldering.To ensure a sufficient mechanical strength of the female sockets 7 and a good contact between the prongs 11 Fig. 12a of the plug socket units and the sockets 7, the sockets 7 have a shoulder 7 which rests in the assembled state on the printed board 4.Fig. 10a shows an embodiment of a plugZsocket unit 2A comprising a plastic body 10, a pair of hollow prongs 11 as well as an electrical component 15 resistor which is contained in a recess 16 of the plastic body 10. Since the recess 16 is open to the top of the plastic body 10, the component 15 may be readily seen from the outside so that the nature of the plug socket unit may be readily identified. The prongs 11 are seated in a throughhole 19 of the plastic body 10. The upper end as seen in Fig. 1Oa of the hollow prong 11 forms a concentric socket 18 for receiving further plugs for making parallel connections, extensions or are serving as testing points.Figs. 11 to 13 show the parts of the plug socket unit of Fig.10. Fig. 11a shows a section of the plastic body 10. Prongs 11 as shown in Figs. 12a and 12b may be inserted into the throughhole 19 of the plastic body 10 of Fig. lia. The hollow prongs 11 are formed by a pressing process out of sheet material having an appropriate rigidity, for example bronze sheet material. The sheet material is bent to form a cylindrical body of the prong 11, the seam of the sheet material having a zig zag form Fig. 12a . A tongue 17 is punched and bent outward from the wall of the hollow prong 11, which tongue serves for making a soldering connection with the lead to the component as seen in Fig. 10a.In the plug socket unit Fig. gila a snap piece 12 is secured to the plastic body 10 by means of locking tabs 14 engaging corresponding locking holes 13 of the plastic body10, as the snap piece 12 is snap fitted into the plastic body 10. In order to facilitate the insertion of the prongs 11 into the holes of the jack panel and also to hold the prongs 11 in place in the inserted position, the upper end of the holes 19 in the plastic body 10 have a somewhat larger diameter than the outer diameter of the prongs 11 so that the prongs 11 have a loose fitting in the upper portion of the holes 19.The point where the leads to the component 15 are soldered to the tongues 17 of the prongs 17 may have a slightly longer distance than shown in Fig. 10a. Then, an elastic force is created which, together with the action of the close fitted lower end of the throughholes 19 and the plastic snap piece 12, presses against the prong 11. In this way the prongs 11 are easily to be inserted or detached to the jack panel, and the prongs 11 also are held securely in the plug socket units.
