# METHOD OF PRODUCING PREFORMED SOLDER MATERIAL FOR USE IN SOLDERING ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS

## Abstract
The production of preformed solder material in the shape of, for example, rings or washers is effected in a more convenient and less costly manner by feeding a thickened fluxed solder paste on to a sheet carrier material, preferably a flexible carrier material, so as to deposit on the carrier material a plurality of the desired preformed shapes and then heating the preformed shapes on the carrier material so as to harden them and cause them to releasably adhere to the sheet of carrier material. The fluxed solder paste is fed on to the sheet of carrier material by a screen printing technique or by means of a stencil. When required for use, the preformed shapes of fluxed solder material can be peeled off the carrier sheet or, if the carrier material is a heat shrinkable plastics film, they can be positioned whilst still on the carrier material to which heat is then applied to cause the plastics film to shrink wrap the soldering site.
