# 3 Demethoxyistamycin B and its 2 N formimidoyl derivative.

## Abstract
As new compounds are provided 3 demethoxyistamycin B and 3 demethoxy 2 N formimidoylistamycin B which each is useful as antibacterial agent because of its high antibacterical activity against a wide variety of gram positive and gram negative bacteria including mycobacteria. These new compounds may be produced by removal of the 3 hydroxyl group of an N,O protected, 3 O demethyl istamycin Bâ‚€, followed by glycylation of the liberated 4 methylamino group and, further, if necessary, followed by formimidoylation of the 2 amino group of an intermediate N protected 3 demethoxyistamycin B derivative.
