# Method of drawing a silicon rod.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method of drawing a monocrystalline silicon rod 1 from a silicon melt 2 contained in a quartz crucible 3. In a method according to the invention the quartz crucible 3 has an internal cross section which decreases gradually downwards. Such rods have an oxygen content which is constant throughout their length. Upon further processing, the oxygen forms oxygen precipitates which have a get tering effect.
