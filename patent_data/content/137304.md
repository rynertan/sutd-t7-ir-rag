# Burst signal generator.

## Abstract
A set value of a frequency setting register 11 is accumulated upon each occurrence of a clock signal, and a waveform memory 14 is read out by using the accumulated value as an address. In the waveform memory, amplitude data of one cycle of the waveform of a burst signal to be generated are stored at fixed phase intervals. The output read out of the waveform memory is converted into an analog signal. A wave number counter 21 counts the number of times the amplitude data of one cycle is read out of the waveform memory and, when having counted by preset number of waves, yields a wave number counting end signal. After the occurrence of the wave number counting end signal a phase counter 31 counts clock signals, and when the count value of the phase counter reaches a value corresponding to a preset end phase, the generation of the burst signal is stopped.
