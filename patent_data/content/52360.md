# Air aspiration device of aircraft mounted gas turbine engine.

## Abstract
A triangular airfoil plate 4 is fixedly supported forward of and below the air intake duct 1 of an aircraft mounted gas turbine engine, and a small airfoil member 9 is fixedly supported below the airfoil plate 4 . An inductive action of leading edge separation vortices 5, 10 generated from the leading edges of the airfoil plate 4 and the small airfoil member 9 is utilized to curve the direction of air flowing into the air intake duct 1 and thereby to prevent turbulence in the intake airflow and resulting defective operation or failure of the engine during flight of the aircraft at large angles Î± of attack.
