# Magnetic bubble memory module.

## Abstract
In the magnetic bubble memory module which is designed to dispose a magnetic bubble memory chip at the center of means for generating a revolving magnetic field, said means being composed of a picture frame core and a coil, and to confine the chip by means of a case for confining a a revolving magnetic field, said chip is made to be loaded on a flexible substrate and signal lines and driving lines of the chip drawn out of the four corners of the case through lead wires on the flexible substrate.
