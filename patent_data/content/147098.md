# ELECTRO OPTIC SWITCHING SYSTEM USING CIRCULARLY POLARIZED LIGHT

## Abstract
A method and an apparatus provide an optical switching system 100 which maintains essentially constant transmis sivity at its maximum value and develops independent of viewing angle two system optical transmission states of substantially contaminant free light. The system includes first and second light gates 102 and 104 of which each has associated therewith contaminant light intensity patterns 48 and 66 with points of local maxima 54, 56, 58, 60, 68, and 70 and local minima 62 and 72 in two system optical transmission states. Quarter wave plates 134 and 136 are positioned between the light gates to develop circular polarization of light propagating between them. The pre sence of circularly polarized light maintains the system transmissivity at its maximum value while the relative orientation of the light gates is changed to align their contaminant light intensity patterns to block the transmis sion of contaminant light, and thereby improve the viewing angle performance.
