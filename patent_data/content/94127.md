# Article having a layer of a nickel phosphorous alloy and coated with a protective layer.

## Abstract
An article which covered with a nickel phosphorus alloy and which is covered on its outer surface with a protective layer which comprises CrPO₄, Cr OH ₃ and may also com prise Cr₂ SO₄ ₃ and in which no nickel is present. The layer provides an excellent corrosion protection. In a particular embodiment the layer is black, scratch resistant in normal use, cannot be wiped off and is not sensitive to finger prints and is extremely suitable for decorative applications. The layers can be obtained electrolytically in a bath which com prises chromic acid and optionally reserved current in a gi ven frequency range, a given range of current densities and a given range of ratios of cathodic to anodic pulse dura tions. In order to obtain the black layers the cathodic time duration is only a fraction of black layers the anodic time duration.
