## Description
PROCESS FOR INTRODUCING PHOSPHINOYL GROUPS INTOAMINO GROUPS This invention relates to a process for introducing phosphinoyl groups into amino groups of amino acids or peptides, or esters of amino acids or peptides, to produce N phosphinoyl derivatives of the amino acid or peptides. These N phosphinoyl derivatives are expected to be useful as drugs, for example as anti hypertensive drugs see JP A 58126896, JP A 553P,382 and EP A 0085488 . The introduction of a dibenzyloxyphosphinoyl group into an amino croup of an amino acid or peptide can be performed by utilizing the so called SchottenBaumann reaction, in which debenzyloxyphosphinoyl chloride hereinafter abbreviated to DBPCl is added to an aqueous solution of amino acid or peptide in the presence of an alkali, resulting in a condensation reaction with the elimination of HCl. With regard to the production of DBPC1, there are known the method wherein dibenzylphosphite hereinafter abbreviated to DBPH is treated with chlorine J. Chem. Soc., 381 1945 l and the method whereinDBPH is treated with SO2Cl2 3. Chem. Soc., 1106 1948 .However, these methods are defective in that poisonous gases such as Cl2 and SO2 are formed as by products. Conversely, DBPCl can be produced bysthreating a dialkylphosphite with a tertiary amine such Ã…as triethylamine in carbon tetrachloride J. Org. Chem, 15, 637 1950 . In this method, no poisonous gas is produced. However, this method is defective in thatDBPCl decomposes during its production or storage, since it is a highly reactive substance. Therefore, more than one mol of DBPCl is needed per mol of amino acid or peptide. Also, the deconosition product may contaminate the desired N dibenzyloxyphosphinoyl amino acid or N dibenzyloxyphosphinoyl peptide. There are known methods which do not isolateDBPCl as an intermediate product. Thus, it is known to add d para substituted benzylphosphite in CC14 to cyclohexylamine or aqueous ammonia to introduce a N di para substituted benzyloxyphosphinoyl group, thereby producing di para substituted benzylcyclohexyl 2mwn0phospXlo te or di para substituted benzylaminophosphonate J. Am. Chem. Soc., 77, 3522 1955 . However, in these methods, the HCl produced reacts with the unreacted amino compound to form the amine hydrochloride which does not participate in the reaction. Therefore, more than two equivalents of amino compound are needed per equivalent of di para substituted benzylphosphite.As an example of a method in which the introduction of a N dibenzyloxyphosphinoyl group is performed by using equivalent amounts DBPH and amino compound, it is known Synthesis, 1975, 509 that a phase transfer catalyst such as benzyltriethylammonium chloride can be used however, the amino used is soluble inCCl4, which is considered as a substitute for the tertiary amines such as trimethylamine given in the above mentioned document see J. Org. Chem., 15, 637 1950 . It is the object of the present invention to provide a novel and a simple process for producing an N phosphinoyl derivative of an amino acid or peptide, or of an ester of an amino acid or peptide, by introducing a phosphinoyl group into an amino group of the amino acid or peptide or ester thereof, which is not soluble in carbon tetrachloride but soluble in water, with high yield. We have found, after detailed investigation, that the introduction of a phosphinoyl group into an amino group proceeds when phosphites namely phosphorous acid diesters are made to react with an casino acid or peptide, or an ester thereof, in a solvent containing water and carbon tetrachloride and consisting of two phases, in the presence of an alkali. Thus, the present invention relates to a process for introducing a phosphinoyl group into an amino group of an amino acid or petide or an ester thereof, characterized in that the amino acid or peptide, or the ester thereof, and a phosphorous acid diester such as a dialkylphosphite, a diarylphosphite or a diaralkylphosphite are subjected to a condensation reaction in one step in a solvent containing water and carbon tetrachloride and consisting of two phases, in the presence of an alkali. The phosphorous acid diester has the formula EMI3.1 wherein R is a hydrocarbon group, preferably an alkyl, aryl or aralkyl group. As the solvent, any solvent containing water and carbon tetrachloride and consisting of two phases can be used. Other components can also be present in the solvent. Examples of the alkali are NaOH,KOH, Na2CO3 and NaHCO3. As the amino acid or peptide, or ester thereof, used in this invention, those which are insoluble in carbon tetrachloride but soluble in water can be used. When the amino acid or peptide, or the ester thereof, has functional groups besides the amino group into which the phosphinoyl group is to be introduced, all or some of the functional groups can be protected with a protective group commonly used however, the amino acid or peptide, or the ester thereof, should be insoluble in carbon tetrachloride and soluble in water. Examples of amino acids which can be used in this invention are neutral amino acids such as alanine and proline, acidic amino acids such as glutamic acid and aspartic acid, and basic amino acids such as lysine and ornithine. Examples of peptides which can be used in this invention are alanyl proline, alanyl prolyl proline, a aspartyl phenylalanine, glutamyl prolyl proline, lysyl prolyl proline, methionylprolyl proline, and alginyl prolyl proline and examples of peptide esters which can be used in this invention are the foregoing peptides in which the carboxylic group is esterified by a lower alkyl group. Examples of the reagents for introducing the phosphinoyl group are dialkylphosphitff whose alkyl groups contain from 1 to 12 carbon atoms such as dimethyl phosphite and diethyl phosphite diaryl phosphites whose aryl groups contain from 6 to 11 carbon atoms such as diphenyl phosphite and di alkylsubstituted phenyl phosphite and diaralkyl phosphites whose aralkyl groups contain from 7 to 12 carbon atoms such as dibenzyl phosphite and di alkyl substituted benzyl phosphite . Since the reaction is performed in a two phase system of water and CCl4, according to this invention, the yield can be raised by improving the agitation efficiency. The yield can also be improved by using a medium which is soluble in both the water and CCl4 used as the solvent. Examples of such media are ethers such as dioxane and tetrahydrofuran , ketones such as acetone , and lower alcohols such as methanol and ethanol . When those media are used, there is no limit upon the amounts used, but it is preferable to use from 1 to 4 volumes thereof for 1 volume of the alkaline solution of amino acid or peptide or ester thereof.These media are usually added to the aqueous solution of amino acid or peptide,or ester thereof, before the addition of the phosphite such as DBPH , but can also be added to the solution of the phosphite such as DBPH in CCl4. The reaction system is preferably kept alkaline, at pH of more than 8. However, when a peptide is used, the pH is preferably kept above 10, and, if the pH is maintained above 13, the production of by products can be restrained. When a peptide ester is used, a pH of from 8 to 10 is preferable, in order to prevent saponification of the ester. The concentration of the aqueous solution of amino acid or peptide, or ester thereof, does not affect the reaction yield, but the concentration generally used is from 0.1 to 2 mol litre. The molar ratio of phosphite such as DBPH to amino acid or petide, or ester thereof, is preferably from 0.8 1 to 2 1, more preferably from 1.0 1 to 1.3 1. The molaration of CCl4 to the phosphite such as DBPH is preferably more than 1 1, more preferably from 1 1 to 13 1. When the time over which the phosphite such as DBPH is added to the CCl4 solution is reduced, side reactions occur easier, but no problem occurs when the phosphite is added over a period of more than 30 minutes. It is usually added over a period of 1 to 2 hours. The reaction is usually completed within 30 minutes to 1 hour after the addition of the phosphite such as DBPH. When the temperature of the reaction system is high, side reactions occur easier therefore the reaction is usually performed at a temperature of from 0 C to 400C. During the reaction, HCl is produced and accordingly the pH of the reaction liquid becomes lower therefore, a base is used as mentioned above in order to maintain the pH value within the alkaline range. By acidifying the aqueous phase of the reaction liquid thus obtained, the required product, for example an N dibenzyloxyphosphinoyl derivative of an amino acid or peptide, or ester thereof, can be produced.When a water soluble peptide ester, such as L alanyl Lprolyl L proline methyl ester, is used as raw material, N ibenzyloxyphosphinoyl L alanyl L prolyl L proline DBPAPP can be produced by, for example, the following procedure. By adding strong base such as NaOU, to the solution in which the reaction was perfmedwithin the pH range of 8 to 10, the ester is saponified, and then after separating the CCl4 phase, the aqueous phase is acidified and thus DBpApp is obtained. As is evident from the above description, DBPH, for instance, and an amino acid or peptide, or an ester of an amino acid or peptide, can be subjected to a condensation reaction in one step without isolating the highly reactive intermediate such as DBPCl, and therefore this invention is very useful industrially. The present invention will now be illustrated by the following Examples. EXAMPLE 1 5.66g 20 mmol of L alanyl L prolyl L proline was dissolved in 12.2 ml of water, 15.0 ml of acetone were added to this solution, the pH of the solution was adjusted to 14.0 with 2N aqueous NaOH solution, and the solution was vigorously stirred while being cooled with ice.

To the slurry produced, 6N HC1 was added and the pH was adjusted to 3.0, and then the slurry was agitated for another 2 hours.
