# TAKE UP DEVICE FOR MAINTAINING CONSTANT WIRE TENSION IN MACHINES FOR FORMING ELECTRIC MOTOR WINDINGS

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a take up device for main taining constant wire tension in machines for forming electric motor windings comprising a support element rotating about a central axis and carrying a plurality of idle deviator members for wire guiding purposes distributed radially and circumferentially on the support, and fixed deviator members lateral to the sup port and aligned diametrically with respect thereto.
