# Bismuth containing steel.

## Abstract
A free machining cast steel shape containing bismuth which functions as a liquid metal embrittler. The ability of the bismuth to function as a liquid metal embrittler is enhanced by restricting the total amount of ingredients which lower the wetting ability of the bismuth to less than the bismuth content and by controlling the amount of strengthening elements added to the steel.
