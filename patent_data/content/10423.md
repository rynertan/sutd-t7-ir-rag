# Improvements in or relating to hand tools.

## Abstract
A hand tool for use in dark or inconvenient locations comprises its own source of illumination for illuminating a workpiece at the point of application of the tool. The hand tool, for example a screwdriver, carries one or more optical fibres 7 generally in such manner that light can only be seen at an end thereof at or in the vicinity of the working part of the tool. The tool includes at or adjacent the other end of the fibre 7 a source of illumination 12 generally housed within a housing part 1 of the tool, but possibly located externally of the tool but operatively associated therewith.
