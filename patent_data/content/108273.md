# A GATE CONTROLLED SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE

## Abstract
A gate controlled semiconductor device comprises a semiconductor element 1 of a wafer of semiconductor material having four layers P₁, N₁, P₂, N₂ of alternate conductivity types defining three series arranged junctions, a cathode electrode divided into a plurality of cathode elec trode assemblies K including a metallic layer 11 deposited on a cathode emitter layer 5 , formed on a surface of said semiconductor element 1 , an anode electrode assembly A , at least one gate electrode assembly G₁, G₂ for supplying an OFF signal to said semiconductor element 1 and impedance adjusting means for changing the turn off time of the main current of said semiconductor element 1 and for equalizing the impedance of current paths between at least one drain 9, 18 of said gate assembly G₁, G₂ and said cathode emitter layer 5 .
