## Description
Device for transforming a uniform circular motion into a variable circular motion, of the same time span with the capacity for regulating the value of the instantaneous angular velocity at a certain Point.The instant application for industrial patent has for its object a device able to transform a uniform circular motion into a variable circular motion having the same value as the average angular velocity and also allowing the setting of the instantaneous angular velocity at a certain point of the trajectory of the variable circular motion.The device in accordance with the instant invention arises from a unique adaption of a common stroke variator, it is therefore opportune in the interests of explaining the aim of the invention more clearly, t fi c to briefly describe the functioning principles of said stroke variator which suitably integrated according to this invention allows for the tvpe of transformation and regulation detailed above.The strike variator which is referred to here comprises a rectangular box containing four gears arranged at the four corners and a central slide, vertically mobile, supporting a pair of sprockets lying side bv side, which hold under tension a transmission chain. This chain is wound externally round the four aforesaid gears and internally round the couple of aforesaid sprockets.Out of the four gears,one is the drive wheel, the other is the driven one,whilst the other two are idle.The pair of sprockets, lying side by side, as already stated, are mounted on a mobile cage or carriage which may be lowered or raised by means of a small wheel which sets in rotation a threaded bar screwed onto the frame of the aforesaid carriage.It is clear, therefore, that by moving the mobile slide in the appropriate direction and in a long enough stroke, it is possible to obtain each time the desired displacement between the gear, and therefore the drive shaft, and the gear, and therefore the driven shaft.By using this stroke variator the invention aims at obtaining, always assuming the angular velocity of the drive gear remains uniform, a va riable angular velocity of the driven gear which nevertheless has an average angular velocity equal to the constant angular velocity of the drive gear, there also being the capacity for setting the value which the angular velocity of the driven gear must have at a certain point during its rotation.This object is achieved,ac cording to this invention,by giving this mobile slide an alternate motion by means of a connecting rod crank device capable of varying the crank arm which obviously results in a variation in the stroke of the slide.In the device according to this invention the mobile slide, therefore, is not moved only when a displacement is wanted between the drive shaft and the driven shaft.but has a constant alternate motion obtained by means of a thrusting crank gear.Therefore, at the entry point of this kinematic chain there is a feed shaft with a constant angular velocity whilst at the exit point there is a driven shaft with a variable angular velocity, having, however, the same time span.In fact, during a stroke of the slide, the guide shaft is displaced in relation to the drive shaft which is then completely and precisely recovered in the successive return stroke of the slide itself the angular velocity of the guide gear, therefore, is decelerated by a half turn of the crank and accelerated by completing the turn.Assuming that the time span of the guide shaft is fixed, its acceleration or deceleration values and therefore its instantaneous angular velocity depend on the instantaneous velocity values of translation of the slide, which are clearly a function, assuming that the span of the crank is fixed, of its stroke which is equal to twice the throw of the crank,By adjusting, therefore, the throw of the crank it is possible to get various instantaneous angular velocity values of the driven shaft, but it should be clear that once the crank arm is set, the angular velocity may vary from time to time but will periodically reassume the same value.These and other objects of this invention will appear hereinafter and, for purposes of illustration but not of limitation, fig. 1 schematically shows the kinematic chain in accordance with the invention.With reference to the aforesaid figure the device in question comprises four gears 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 arranged atihe four corners of an imaginary rectangle and linked by a transmission chain 5 which is wound externally round them and internally round a couple of sprockets 6 which hold said chain under tension. These sprockets 6 are idle and mounted onto a central slide 7 . They are set in alternate motion by a thrusting crank gear including a connecting rod 8 and a crank 9 , made up of a pulley characterized by a diametrical slit 9a along which the big end of the connecting rod 8a slides and stops.The drive gear 1 and the crank 9 are both set in rotation by the same driving wheel 10 . It is clear that the gears 2 and 4 are idle whilst the gear 3 is the driven entry point, the angular velocity of which will be variable.As already stated, by varying the fixing point of the big end of the connecting rod 8a along the slit 9a of the crank 9 it will be possible to vary the stroke of the slide 7 and therefore influence the rate of the acceleration or deceleration of the driven gear 3 , assuming that its span is fixed.It should be noted at this stage since the slit 9a is deli rately extended diametrically across the pulley 9 , it is also possible to invert the deceleration phase with the acceleration phase by simply moving the stopping point of the big end to the diametrically opposed point along the slit 9 ,For the purposes of illustration we shall now describe a machine to which the device in accordance with the instant invention may be applied,For example, an automatic packing machine fitted with a device for stamping the date on each packet on the packing line,In this case it is usual to employ a cliché on a roller with a constant angular velocity and a circumference equal to the length of one packet.It is obvious that the tangential velocity of the roller must be equal to the linear velocity of the forward moving line, so that at the contact point between the click and the line there is no sliding on either part with resulting friction which would not only ruin the quality of the stamping but might even tear the packet itself. By keying the roller carrying the cliché onto the driven shaft of the device in accordance with the herein described invention, it will be easy and quick to vary the tangential velocity of the click at the point of contact with the packet, to make it always equal to the forward moving velocity of the stamping line.This variation is necessary each time the length of the packet changes and involves the replacement of the click carrving roller with one of a different size having a circumference equal to the length of the new packet.
