# Gas insulated switchgear.

## Abstract
Gas insulated switchgear comprises at least one inter rupter 12, 14, 16 disposed at an end of the region to be protected, at least one arc detector 30 disposed for detecting an arc within a vessel 32 in which an electrically insulating gas is filled, the vessel being within the region to be protected, and a fault detector 50 for detecting a fault. A control device 10 actuates the interrupter only when the fault detector detects the fault and also the arc detector detects the arc. The vessel 32 is preferably a housing of a said interrupter.
