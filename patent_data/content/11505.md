# Multi cylinder internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
An internal combustion engine is disclosed which includes a plurality of cylinders split into first and second groups, and an intake passage 12 provided with a throttle valve 16 and bifurcated downstream, of the throttle valve 16 into two branches 12a, b one communicated with the first group of cylinders 1 3 and the other communicated through a stop valve 20 with the second group of cylinders 4 6 . The second group of cylinders 4 6 are bypassed by an EGR passage 22 provided therein with an EGR valve 24 . Control means is provided for causing the air valve 20 to open a predetermined time after the EGR valve 24 closes when the engine operation is shifted from its low load condi tion to a high load condition.
