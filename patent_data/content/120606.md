# Self bonding enameled wire and hermetic compressor motor using the same.

## Abstract
The self bonding enameled wire has an electric insulation layer coated thereon and a bonding layer coated over the insulation layer. The bonding layer is prepared with a mixture including a 100 parts by weight of a phenoxy resin and or an epoxy resin, both the resins containing not larger than 5 ppm of sodium chloride and having a limiting viscosity of not less than 0.440 as measured in tetrahydrofuran solvent at 25 C and b 20 to 100 weight parts of a n butylated melamine resin. In place of this n butylated melamine resin, there is, according to another aspect of the present invention, used 20 to 50 parts by weight of a mixture of a stabilized polyiso cyanate and one of a n butylated melamine resin and a benzoguanamine resin is used. These self bonding enameled wire are excellent in refrigerant resistance and may be suit ably used for windings of a stator coil in hermetic compressor motors.
