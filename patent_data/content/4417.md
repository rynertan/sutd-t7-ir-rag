# Gas phase olefin polymerisation system and process for operating it.

## Abstract
A gas phase olefin polymerisation system is provided with means for sensing a potentially dangerous condition such as a rapidly increasing temperature and or pressure, and means for introducing carbon dioxide into the system to at least reduce the rate of polymerisation. The system may be a stirred bed system provided with means for automatically introducing carbon dioxide into the system in response to failure of the stirrer motor.
