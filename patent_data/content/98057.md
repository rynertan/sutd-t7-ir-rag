# IMPROVED VALVE DEVICE FOR INCREASING THE FUEL ECONOMY AND REDUCING THE EMISSIONS FROM AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE

## Abstract
Valve device includes a valve chamber 7 containing three spherical members 8, 9, 10 in stacked relation which produce a limited pulsating air flow that is metered in precise amounts at any given time into the fuel air path of a gasoline powered internal combustion engine. The valve chamber has a main entry orifice 16 and one or more supplemental entry orifices 17 , the size and number of which may be varied to obtain the desired range or spread of frequencies for a particular engine over its entire operating range.
