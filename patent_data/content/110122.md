## Description
Pick up for transforming mechanical quantities into electrical quantitiesThe present invention concerns a pick up or transducer for transforming mechanical into electrical quantities, in particular a pick up intended for observation of the position of a movable member in a tractor or equivalent, said pick up transforming the position of the movable member into an electric signal, and said pickup being based on an application of the Hall effect.The conversion of various mechanical quantities into electrical values is problematic because heretofore no such pick up has been in use which contains no components susceptible to damage, which does not display temperature creep nor need of adjustment.The main object of the invention is therefore to provide a pick up meeting the aims mentioned. It is an additional object of the invention to provide a pickup of simple structure and reliable in its operation for position sensing. A need to sense various machine elements occurs e.g. in connection with tractors and other traction and work machines. In these practical applications there is particularly evident the need of reliable position indication with a pick up having no components susceptible to damage, and tolerating impurities, and which is not sensitive to ambient temperature variations.The position sensing applications in tractors include the position observation of force measuring flexure bars, of angle measuring cams, of various levers and linkage or other rods, or of various components in the steering gear, towards purposes of control or safety.The need of pick ups constituting the object of the invention is particularly acute in tractor control systems, where is needed e.g.continuous observing of the lifting means or of force measuring flexure bars. Since the control systems in question are predominantly electrical, there is also a need to obtain from the pick up a signal of high enough voltage or current level and which is dependent on the position of the member that is being observed.In prior art are known so called proximity switches by which one obtains ON OFF information concerning a closely positioned object.Furthermore known in the art are the so called linear output Hall effect transducers, as an example the PK 8764 3 by Micro Switch.These pickups, and others of which we are aware, have however not been able to solve all the problems mentioned, particularly not when such pickups would be needed in adverse operating conditions, as is the case for instance in a tractor.An additional object of the present invention is observation of movement or position without having to interfere with the metallic body itself of which the position is observed, and the object of the invention is therefore to provide a pick up which does not require a permanent magnet to be fixed on the member that is being observed.The starting point for the present invention was to apply the so called Hall element. The operation of these elements is based on the fact that in an electrical conductor in a magnetic field is produced an electric field perpendicular against the current and proportional to the current and to the magnetic field. The path of the current carrying charged particles, electrons for instance, becomes curved, implying the generation of an electric field at right angles against the original direction of current. If the conductor is a thin strip, it becomes possible directly to measure the potential difference between its sides, the so called Hall voltage, which is inversely proportional to the thickness of the strip.Since the strength of the Hall phenomenon is dependent on the properties of the charge carriers in the respective material, it has been used especially in the case of semiconductors to investigate into the quality, number and mobility of charge carriers. Since the strength of the Hall effect is proportional to the flux density of the magnetic field, it has also been used in measuring magnetic field strengths, as is well known.In order to attain the aims mentioned above, and others which will become apparent later on, the invention is mainly characterized in that a Hall element has been disposed in conjunction with a permanent magnet, the pick up comprises an electronic unit fixedly accommodated within the protective structure of the pick up adjacent to the saidHall element, and said electronic unit is used to amplify the voltage supplied by theHall element to a pick up output voltage of sufficient level and which is substantially linearly dependent on the distance between the object of ferromagnetic material that is being observed and theHall element of the pick up. It is thus understood that the invention is based on using a Hall element which is advantageous as regards price, temperature characteristics and repeatability, applied in a manner more closely specified in the invention. It is not necessary in the invention to attach any electromagent or permanent magnet to the metallic part that is being measured in the invention, to wit, an object of material with good magnetic conductivity.To advantage, the non processible signal derived from the Hall element applied as taught by the invention is amplified in conjunction with the pick up itself, preferably by means of a differential amplifier set up.In the following, the invention is described in detail with reference being made to an embodiment example of the invention, presented in the figures of the attached drawing, to the details o whirs the invention is in no way narrowly confined. Fig. 1 presents, partly sectioned, a pick up according to the invention.Fig. 2 presents the electric circuit diagram of the pickup of the invention.Fig. 3 illustrates schematically the placement of the pick up of the invention in conjunction with the object that is being measured.Fig. 4 shows the output voltage obtained with a pick up according to the invention, plotted over the distance of the body that is being observed.Fig. 5 displays separately the Hall element amployed in the invention.As shown in Fig. 1, the pick up of the invention consists of a permanent magnet 11, which is a cylindrical body. The permanent magnet 11 is like a bar magnet, so that its S and N poles can be imagined to be located at the planar ends of the cylinder. In conjunction with a permanent magnet of this kind is formed a closed magnetic field, known in itself, between the poles S and N. The permanent magnet 11 has been inserted in a protective socket 13 of non magnetic material, e.g. aluminium or hard plastic, with a view to achieving sufficient mechanical strength. Within the socket 13 has been placed e.g. embedded in silicone compound 16, an electronic circuit board 20, from which departs a cable 17. Through the cable 17 an appopriate operating voltage e.g. 5 volts is supplied to the pick up. Furthermore, the output voltage V of the pick up out is obtained through the cable 17.On the planar outer end face 11 of the permanent magnet 11, upon a thin insulating disk 15, has been placed a Hall element 10, from which depart the connecting leads a, b1 c and d. As will be evident from Fig. 5, the Hall element 10 is a button like, flat element having four connecting leads a d. These leads a d are conducted, electrically insulated from the permanent magnet 11, in grooves 12. provided in the permanent magnet, to the circuit board 20.In the foregoing, the mechanical design of the pick up of the invention has been described in its main features. In the following shall be described, referring to Fig. 2, an advantageous electrical embodiment example of the invention. As is well known, the Hall element 10 is current con8using, and it is supplied with the current I through the leade from the 5 V pole. The current I is o o on the order of 5 IA. The other pole c of the current source is connected to ground.From the poles b and d of the Hall element the voltage V is obtained, which is only on the order of 10 mV. It is in thus obvious that the voltage V must be considerably amplified in in order to be usable to the purposes envisioned in the invention.Fig. 2 shows an advantageous amplifying circuit in which are used two operational amplifiers 21 and 22 connected in cascade, the first of the two being differentially connected. The second operational amplifier 22 is non inverting. The gain V V of the out in circuit is on the order of 30 to 45.At the poles f and g, the output voltage V of the pick up is out obtained, this voltage being 2 5 volts, as can be seen in Fig. 4.Since the input voltage V from the Hall element 10 has compara in tively low level, the invention teaches to place the electronic board 20 in immediate conjunction with the pick up, within its protective socket 13. It is hereby possible to avoid external interference to a sufficient degree.As shown in Fig. 4, the output voltage V of the pick up of the out invention is e.g.linearly dependent on the distance d of the object 14 that is being observed, in the manner shown by the characteristic graph G. Within the range d on the distance scale d, the char 0 acteristic graph g is sufficiently linear with a view to needs occurring in practice. Thus, from the pick up of the invention an output voltage V t is obtained which is on the order of 5 2 V. outThis is a voltage level which can be carried, without interference, with the cable 17 over considerable distances long enough for practical purposes, for instance to the control unit of a tractor.In Fig. 3 is illustrated the arrangement in relation to each other of the pick up and the body 14 that is being observed. The body 14 to be observed is for instance a cylindrical body rotating about the axis A A, in other words an eccentric cam unit, its distance d from the end face 11 of the pick up varying as a function of the rotational angle of the body 14 in its rotation about the axis A A.The body 14 consists of material having good magnetic conductivity, i.e., a ferromagnetic material. Therefore, the body 14 concentrates the magnetic field in conjunction with the Hall element 10, the stronger the smaller the distance d. As a result, a characteristic graph like the graph G in Fig. 4 is obtained.The pick up of the present invention is intended to be applied above all in tractors, although other applications are equally possible within the scope of the invention. In tractors, the pick up of the invention is particularly appropriate for indicating the position of a flexural bar, the position of an eccentric cam, e.g. indication of the angle of rotation of a shaft, for sensing the position of a steering stick, indication of the neutral position of steering, observing the state of an injection pump and or application in connection with engine overload protection. The pick up of the invention may also be used in likeness with anON OFF component. In the following are stated the claims, various details of the invention being allowed to vary within the inventive idea thereby defined and to deviate from that which has been presented in the foregoing by way of example only.
