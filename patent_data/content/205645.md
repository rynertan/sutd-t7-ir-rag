# Suspension control system.

## Abstract
A microphone 5 which is provided in the vicinity of a front seat of a vehicle either inside or outside the vehicle, detects a vibration developed during run of the vehicle as a vibration sound. Output of the microphone is applied to a bandpass filter 6 having a bandwidth of frequency from 1 Hz to 15 Hz, the vibration of which frequency renders a driver or passengers most uncomfortable. A vibration level of components in the above mentioned bandwidth among the detected vibration is compared with a reference level. When the vibration level of those components exceeds the reference level, the damping force of shock absorbers 4 mounted on wheel axles of the vehicle is reduced.

## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTION SUSPENSION CONTROL SYSTEMBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention The present invention relates to a suspension control system for a vehicle which controls a suspension, by changing the damping force of shock absorbers which are mounted between a chassis and wheel axles of the vehicle.Description of the Related Art Hitherto, a suspension control system for a vehicle is known which automatically controls a damping force of hydraulic shock absorbers provided on wheel axles in order to prevent a nose diving of a vehicle when brakes are applied suddenly, a rolling upon sharp cornering, and a squating when the vehile is started rapidly. In such a known control system, the attitude of the vehicle is predictively controlled on the basis of the driver S will or judgement, tor example, the degree of rapid acceleration required by the driver is detected by sensing the opening of a throttle valve, and the degree of squating is predicted in advance, based upon the detected degree of acceleration. Then, the damping force of the shock absorbers is increased in accordance with the predicted degree of squating. Similarly, in a case of the nose diving or the rolling, the degree of deceleration or turning is detected from the movement of a brake pedal or the amount of a steering angle, respectively. In this manner, the adjustment of the damping force of the shock absorbers is made based upon only the driver s will or judgement. No consideration has been given to the condition of a road surface, so that it was difficult to achieve the safe drive in every condition of the road surface. For instance, when the vehicle runs onto a rough road from a smooth road, not only the driving comfortability is suddenly reduced, but also, in serious cases, it becomes difficult to maintain the safty of driving.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a suspension control system that is able to realize the comfortable driving on every condition of the road surface. A feature of the present invention is in that a vibration caused by runrl i. ng of the vehicle is detected and, when a vibration level of components of a particular frequency band among the detected vibration is larger than a predetermined reference level, the damping force of the shock absorber is adjusted to decrease.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig.l is a schematic diagram showing a basic construction of a suspention control system according to an embodiment of the present invention and Fig.2 shows a detailed circuit of the embodiment shown in Fig.l. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Referring to Figs.l and 2, the description will be made hereinafter of a suspension control system according to an embodiment of the present invention. Fig.l is a schematic diagram showing a basic construction of the suspention control system In the figure, a reference numeral 1 shows a vehicle body, which is supported by wheels 2 through a suspension mechanism composed of springs 3 and shock absorbers 4. In the shock absorber 4 used for the present invention, the damping force thereof can be adjusted by changing the opening of an orifice through which the fluid within the shock absorber flows. Such a type of the shock absorber is already known. For example, a rotary valve can be available for the orifice with the variable opening and an appropriate actuator such as a solenoid coil changes the opening of the rotary volve in response to a signal applied thereto. Therefore, it should be understood that the shock absorber 4 shown inFig.l comprises such an actuator. During the vehicle runs, the vibration is developed in various parts of the vehicle in accordance with the condition of the road surface. In this embodiment, the developed vibration is sensed as a sound by a sound collector 5 such as a microphone. It is of course that the vibration itself can be detected directly by a known vibration meter, e.g. an acceleration sensor, a vibration pickup and so on. Only from a matter of cost, the sound collector is used in this embodiment. Further, with respect to the location where the sound collector 5 is installed, both the outside and the inside of the vehicle can be chosen arbitrarily. According to the object and concept of the present invention, it is most suitable to provide the sound collector 5 on the floor under front seats or, outside the vehicle, in the vicinity thereof. The output of the sound collector 5 is sent to a filter 6 which has the function as a bandpass filter. As is well known, such a filter can pass only a signal in a particular band of frequencies. The signal which has passed through the filter 6 is led to a controller 7.The controller 7, after a predetermined signal processing described in detail later, furnishes a control signal, which is applied to the actuator of the shock absorber 4. By the way, the frequency of vibration which a human feels to be uncomfortable is already known. According to one example of experimental data cf. Journal of theSociety of Automotive Engineers of Japan Vol.36, No.12, 1982. Page 1231 ff Effects of Vibration and Noise onHuman Body by M. Oshima , a human is most discomforted by the vibration of frequency between several hertz and about 1OHz, On the other hand, a passenger car is said to generally have resonance frequencleq of about 1.5Hz and 12 to 13fez in a part over the spring and in a part under the spring, respectively.In view of these condition. it is effective to establish the bandwidth of the filter 6 from about lH to about 15Hz. Here, it is to be understood that the resonance frequency is different in accordance with the type or sort of the vehicles so that there can be more or less variance in a low and an upper frequency of the bandwidth of the filter 6. Fig.2 shows a detailed circuit construction of the whole system of the embodiment shown in Fig. 1. In both figures, like parts are identified by the same reference numeral. With this arrangement when an ignition switch 12 is turned on, the voltage of a battery 10 is supplied to a regulator 14 through a diode D2. The diode D2 is for the purpose of avoiding a trouble if the battery 10 was carelessly connected in the reverse polarity. The regulator 14 furnishes a constant voltage Vc to the filter 6 and the controller 7 as a source voltage for the operation thereof. Under this condition, the vibration sound developed by a vehicle body is monitored by the sound collector 5. The output of the sound collector 5 is led to the filter 6 which is constisuted with resistors Rl to R5, condensers Cl and C2, and an operational amplifier A1.The filter 6 is formed as a bandpass active filter with a gain of the operational amplifier A1. The bandwidth of the filter 4 is established by the values of the resistors R1 to R3 and the condensers C1 and C2. In this embodiment, the bandwidth of frequency from 1Hz to 15fez is set up from the point of view, as described above.The resistors R and R5 provide a bias voltage for the operational amplifier Al. Usually, two source voltage of different polarity from each other are necessary for the operation of an operational amplifier. By means of the bias voltage provided by the resistors R4 and R5, however, the operational amplifier A1 can operate even in a single source voltage circuit as shown in the figure. Then, the vibration sound signal output from the filter 6, which includes only components of the particular friquencies, is given to a detection and smoothing section 71 of the controller 7. In this section 71, the vibration sound signal is rectified by a diode D1 and smoothed by a resistor R6 and a condenser C. A voltage Vg appearing. across the condenser C3 is proportional to the level of the vibration which is. in the frequency range that gives .uncomfortable feeling to the driver and or passengers.The voltage V0 is applied to a comparing section 72 within the controller 7 which is formed by resistors R7 to R10 and an amplifier A2 In the comparing section 72, the voltage Vg is compared with the reference voltage, which is provided by dividing the constant source voltage Vcc in accordance with the resistance value of the resistors R8 and Rg. I the voltage Vg becomes larger than the reference voltage, the comparing section 72 produces an output signal. This output signal is led to a driving section 73 of the controller 7 which is constructed with resistors R11 and R12 and a transistor T1 The transistor T1 is turned on by the output signal from the comparing section72, so that solenoid coils of an actuator 40 are excited by the voltage of the battery 10.Upon excitation of the actuator 40, the opening of the orifice of the shock absorber 4 becomes large, whereby the damping force of the shock absorber 4 is reduced. If, as reduction of the damping force, the vibration level goes down, the voltage V0 is also decreased. When the voltage Vg becomes lower than the reference voltage, the output of the comparing section 72 disappears so that the transistor T1 turns off and the excitation of the actuator 40 is stopped. As a result, the orifice returns to the condition of the small opening, and the damping force becomes large again. In case the vibration level does not decrease in spite of the reduction Of the damping force, the shock absorber 4 is kept at the low damping force, .In this embodiment, the damping force is controlled at two steps. However, it is possible to provide more steps of control. For that purpose, the reference voltage must be provided correspondingly to the number of the control steps, and the opening of the orifice of the schock absorber has to be controlled accordingly. These technical measures, i,e, providing a comparing circuit with two or more reference voltages and controlling the diameter of the orifice at two or more steps, are obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art. Having thus described the various modifications within the knowledge of person in the art may be realized within the scope of the appended claims without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.
