# Temperature control system thermally responsive electrovacuum relay therefor.

## Abstract
An electro vacuum relay 10 is disclosed comprising a thermally responsive actuator 18 mounted in the lower end of a housing 14, 16 which defines a vent chamber 66. Upper and lower fluid ports 38, 40 are integrally molded into the housing and communicate with vent chamber 66. A pair of electrical terminals 22 and 24 include tab portions 30, 32 which extend through housing cover 16 and into the vent chamber. A carrier member 68 is movable in the vent chamber and has reacting against its upper end a compression biasing spring 88 and against its lower end an output member 64 of thermal actuator 18. A rectangularly shaped elastomeric valve member 72 is mounted in an opening 74 in the carrier and has an upwardly extending double beaded sealing surface 76 around its periphery that engages with a valve surface formed by an inner wall portion 42 of main housing 14. An electrical contact member 80 is received in another opening formed in carrier 68 and is spring biased outwardly toward tab portions 30, 32 by a spring 82 which also functions to seat the valve member against inner wall portion 42.
