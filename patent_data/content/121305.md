# A multicolor liquid crystal display.

## Abstract
A multicolor display 300 which comprises a high con trast liquid crystal device 320 , light source 314 and a luminance balanced color mask 318 . The liquid crystal device is the transmissive, twisted nematic type having high extinction ratio polarizers on the input and output sides and functions as a light shutter for the display. The liquid crystal material has a dichroic dye admixed therein to prevent build up of the contrast limiting orthogonal mode electric vector of polarized light. The color mask contains different colored patches with gray surrounds, and the colored patches are luminance balanced in order that the different colored data displays are of substantially equal brightness. During the off state there is no light bleed through so that the display pres ents a uniformly dark state or dead front.
