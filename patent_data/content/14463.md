## Description
DESCRIPTION of an invention having for a title SELF EXTINGUISHING POLYOLEFIN COMPOSITIONS HAVING .9N IMPROVED RESISTANCE TO HEAT AND TO THERMO OXIDATION . The present invention concerns self extinguishing polymeric compositions based on oleo in homo or copolymers such as polypropylene, polyethylene or ethylene propylene copolymers. The Prior Art knows several different processes for making the polymers incombustible. the leas recent ones of such processes are in general based on the use of metal com pounds, especially of antimony, in combination with thermally unstable halogenated compounds, suh as for instance chlorinated paraffin waxes. The Combinations metal compound halogenated compound give results that are satisfactory as far as the self extinguishing properties they confer to the polymers are concerned, but they show serious drawbacks corrosion phtnomenz in the equipment in which is carried out the processing of the materials, and a heavy emission of toxic smokes and ga ses in case of a fire. Moreover, there are attained acceptable levels of self extinguishing properties only by using high concentrations of such combinations. More recently, research was directed to the use of o binations comprising an ammonium or an amine phosphate, or another phosphorus compound, and one or more nitrogen contain ing organic compounds, such as for instance melamine, dicyan diamine or aminopiast resins. Such combinations do not show the above described drawbacks, but the polymeric compositions that contain them in ge neral have poor heat and thermo oxidation resistance. The Applicant has now surprisingly found particular phosphorus and nitrogen containing anti flame additives which, besides conferring high levels of self extinguishing proper ties to the polyolefins to which they are added, do not have the disadvantage of a poor resistance to heat and to thermo oxidation. The compositions object of the present invention, for 1o0 parts of composition, contain t from 5 to 30 parts of an ammonium phosphate and 2 from 3 to 20 parts of one or more nitrogen containing compounds selected from a benzyl guanamine b reac tion products of guanamines of formula EMI3.1 wherein R phenyl, benzyl, with aldehydes c reaction products of al dehydes with two nitrogen containing compounds one having formulaEMI3.2 wherein R H, NH2, phenyl, benzyl, and the other one being a compound con taining the functions C O and or S and inserted in a cyclic structure the molar ratio between the two nitrogen containing compounds present in c ran ging from 4 1 to 1 4. Amongst the various usable phosphates, there are preferred the ammonium polyphosphates which fall under the general formula NH4 n 2PnO3n 1 wherein n represents an integer equal to or greater than 2 the molecular weight of the polyphospates should be preferably sufficiently high to ensure a low solubility in water. The composition of the polyphosphates of the above indi cated formula, in which n is a number sufficiently great, is practically the one corresponding to the formula of the metaphosphates NH4PO3 . An example of such polyphosphates is that known under the commercial name of Exolit 263 produced and sold byBenckiser Knapsack SmbH and having the composition NH4PO3 n in which n is greater than 50 another example is the product known under the trade mark Phos Check P 30 produced by Mon santo Chemical Co. and having the same composition. Representative examples of the compounds cited in 2 , containing the functions C 0 and or sCtS and NH inserted in a cyclic structure, are ethylene urea, ethylene thlourea, hydantoin, hexahydropyrimi dine 2 one, piperazine 3,6 dione, barbituric acid and uric acid. The preferred aldehyde is formaldehyde which may be used according to any ratio nitrogen containing compound CH20 capable of yielding cross linked products. Amongst the reaction products c cited in 2 , very interesting for their facility of preparation and anti flame effectiveness, proved to be the products that are obtained When reacting a methylol derivative of melamine with the com pounds containing the functions C O and or z S and inserted in a cyclic structure. In such methylol derivatives of melamine the molar ratio melamine CH20 may range from 1 1 to 1 6 they are prepared by condensation of formaldehyde in an aqueous solution with melamine at 80 100 and at a pH com prised between S and 10. An example of a methylol derivative of melamine ie the product known under the commercial name of Lamelite C produced and sold by Montedison S.p.A. . To prepare Lamelite C a 368 by weight volume aqueous solution of formaldehyde is introduced into an autoclave, and brought to a pH 6f about 9 with an aqueous solution of NaOH at 30 by weight the solution is then heated to 7O0C, added with melamine in such a quantity as to bring the molar ratio formaldehyde melamine to the value of 2.5 1 and the condensation is carried out at 900C and at a pH comprised between 9.4 and 9.9 until attaining a compatibility with water, at 20 C, corresponding to a ratio by volume water resin of about 1.25 1. Thereupon the autoclave is cooled down and there are added an aqueous solution of NaOH at 30 concentration until bringing the pli to a value comprised between 9.8 and 10.2, and deionized water in such a quantity as to bring the content of dry solid product to about 50 .The syrup thus obtained is filtered, cooled down to about 20 C and at ieast spray dried. To prepare the reaction products b , cited in 2 , it is operated in the following way 1 mole of phenyl guanamine benzoguanamine or of benzyl guanamine phenylaceto guanamine is dissolved under heat in an aqueous solution of formaldehyde at 15 by weight yolume 4 moles , and the solution thus obtained is brought to a pii of 9 10 with an aqueous solution of NaOH and thereafter slowly dripped into water acidificd with H2SO4 pH 1 maintained at 70 80 C under vigtirous stirring a finely subdivided white product precipitates. It is neutralized with an aqueous solution of NaHCO3, filtered, dried, ground, repeatedly washed with water and then again dried. The preparation of the reaction products c , cited in 2 , is achieved in an analogous way. For instance A 1 mole of phenyl guanamine and 2 moles of ethvlene urea are dissolved in a solution of formaldehyde at 15 by weight volume 4moles . The solution thus obtained is brought to a pH comprised between 9 and 10 with an a queous solution of NaOH, heated to 700 800C undcr stirring and made to slowly drip into water acidified with H SO pH l maintained at 24 70 80 C under vigorous stirring there precipitates a finely subdivided white product.The whole i then al lowed to cool down, still under stirring, it is neutra lized with an aqueous solution of NaHCO3, filtered, dried, ground, repeatedly washed with water and then again dried.B 1 niol of phenyl guanamine and 2 mols of ethylene urea are dissolved, at 80 90 C and under stirring, in an a queous solution of formaldehyde at 37 by weight volume 4 moles . The solution thus obtained is maintained at 80O 9ooC until the precipitation of the pre condensation product begins. Thereupon, by decanting, the excess of liquid is separated, thefreaction product is dried for 4 hours at 1700 1800C, ground, washed with water and again dried.C 1 part by weight of ethylene urea and 2 parts of Lamelite C are dry mixed together in a conventional powder mixer, and the obtained mixture is kept i an oven, in the absen of air andEMI8.1 in a slight current of nitrogen for 2 hours at 160 C a condensation product is formed, with elimina tion of water and formaldehyde, which is ground to the de sired fineness. The compositions according to this invention can be ob tamed according to known methods for instance, by mixing together the polyolefin and the anti flame additives,in a blade XXXer of the Banbury type at the plastification temperature of the polyolefine.The blend obtained is then extruded in a DOLCI type extruder screw diameter w 20 mm length diameter ratio of the screw equal to 23 screw speed 20 rpm at the temperature most suited for obtaining a granular product. For an evaluation of the self extinguishing properties of the polyolefine compositions, object of this invention, in general it is proceeded in the following way with the granular product thin plates of 3 mm thickness are pressure formed on a small CARVER type press, operating for 7 minutes at a pressure of 40 kg sq.cm and at a suitable temperature. On the plates thus prepared the level of the seif extin yuishing properties either is determined by measuring according to ASTM D 2863 standard the Oxygen Index which expresses the minimum percentage of O2 in a O2 N2 mixture necessary for the sam ple to burn in a continuous way, or by applying the UL 94 rules edited by the Underwriters Laboratories USA which supply an evaluation of the degree of self ex tinguishing capacity of plastic materials. The UL 94 rules foresee various testing conditions that are more or less severe and allow to classify the sample at different selfextinguishing capacity levels. In the tests reported on the table, there has been adopted the Vertical Burning Test which allows to classify the materials at decreasing levels 94 V O, 94 V i, 94 V 2. Each test is carried out on a set of 5 test pieces which may have a thickness of .1 4, 1 8 or 1 6 . , , .of an inch, The test piece, maintained in a vertical position by a suitable support, is primed with a flame at its lower end and there are carried out two ignition trials, each of a duration of 10 seconds, The three levels of self extinguishing capacity mentioned above may briefly be defined as follows 94 v o No test piece burns for more than 10 seconds after each application of the flame or drops lit up articles. Mo reover, the total combustion time doe not exceed 50 seconds in the 10 tri2lE undertaken on the set of 5 test pieces.94 V l There are admitted combustion times of up to 30 sec. per each single test piece, and up to 250 seconds for the trials carried out on the set of 5 test pieces. Al so at this level no test piece drops lit up particles.94 V 2 The admitted combustion times are the same as those of level 94 V 1 except that there is admitted the drop of lit up particles. On the following table there have been recorded the results of some tests carried out with polypropylene containing various anti flame additives according to this invention. Example 6 is a comparative example it shows that the com positions comprising the nitrogen containing compounds of the invention show a resistance to heat and to thermo oxidation greater than that of the compositions comprising as a nitrogen containing compound a reaction product of formaldehyde with ethylene urea or with a similar nitrogen containing cyclic compound.
