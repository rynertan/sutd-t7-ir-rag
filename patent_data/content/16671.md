# Method for the addition of a reactive metal to a molten metal bath.

## Abstract
A method for the addition of a reactive metal to a molten metal bath 10 wherein the vapor pressure of the reactive metal at the bath temperature exceeds the total ambient pressure above the surface 120 of the bath by establishing a gaseous atmosphere containing a nonreactive gas and a small quantity of SFâ‚† above the surface of the bath so as to increase the recovery of the reactive metal addition in the bath.
