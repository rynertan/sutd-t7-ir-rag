# Electrodeposition of chromium and its alloys.

## Abstract
A chromium electroplating electrolyte containing a source of trivalent chromium ions, a complexant, a buffer agent and a sulphur species having S O or S S bonds for promoting chromium deposition, the complexant being selected so that the stability constant K₁ of the chromium complex as defined herein is in the range 10⁶ K₁ 10¹² M ¹ and the sulphur species being selected from thiosul phates, thionates, polythionates and sulfoxylates. Complex ants within this range include aspartic acid, iminodiacetic acid, nitrilotriacetic acid, 5 sulphosalicylic acid or citric acid.
