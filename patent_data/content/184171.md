# DEVICE HAVING IMPROVED CONTACT METALLIZATION

## Abstract
The present invention solves the problem of contact surface roughening by providing contact metallization hav ing physical barriers within the metallization which prevent significant movement of metal particles during temperature cycling of the metallization. In general, the contact metalliza tion includes a conductive constituent and a barrier consti tuent. Preferably, layers of the conductive constituent are interspersed with layers of the barrier constituent. The resulting contact metallization is free from significant contact surface roughening thereby minimizing the problem of shorts in the device.
