# HEAT COOKING OVEN.

## Abstract
A heat cooking oven for heating the atmosphere in a heating chamber 5 by an electric heater to a high temperature for cooking food. The electric heater has a heating element 1 in a container 3 and the lead part 11 of a lead wire 2 as sealed at the container in such a manner that the lead part 11 is disposed within the chamber 5 and is projected out of the chamber 5 . Since the element 1 is sealed in the container 3 , it can be prevented from oxidizing and can heat at high temperature, thereby accelerating the cooking speed. Since the sealed lead part 11 is cooled by the outer atmosphere and retained at a low temperature, this invention can prevent damage to the lead wire due to the difference of thermal expansion coefficients between the container 3 and the lead wire 2 and can prolong its lifetime.

## Description
SPECIFICATIONTITLE Cooking ApplianceTECHNICAL FIELD This invention relateS to a cooking appliance having a heating chamber adapted to have its atmosphere heated to high temperature for cooking food therein and mor.e particularly it relates to a cooking appliance characterized by high cooking speed, energy saving and long heater life.BACKGROUND ART A conventional cooking appliance having a heating chamber adapted to have its atmosphere heated by an electric heater to high temperatures for.cooking food therein uses as said electric heater a sheathed heater or a heater having a heater coil enclosed in a heat resistant insulating mate rial, such as quartz tubes, or the so called 6uartz tube heater.Both or said heaters,. however, have their heatgenerating sections exposed to the air, so that if heated to very high temperatures, they would bye damaged by oxida tion it has heretofore been impossible to heat the heat generating sections to temperatures above l,0000C . Therefare, it takes much time for the atmosphere in the heating chamber to reach a high temperature, lowering the cooking speed, and the energy loss involved has been very large. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, this invention.provides a cooking appliance characterized by high cooking speed, energy saving and long heater life.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is a frount view of a cooking appliance, showing an embodiment of the present invention Fig. 2 is a front view, in section , of said cooking appliance Fig. 3 is a sectional view of the principal portion of said cooking appliance Fig. 4 is a sectional view of the principal portion of Åa cooking appliance according to another embodiment.of the invention and Fiq. 5 is a perspective view of the principal portion of Fig 1. BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION In Figs. 1 through 5 , a filament 1 made of a high melting point material, such as tungsten, used as a heater has lead out wires 2 , such as molybdenum wires, fixed to the opposite ends thereof, said filament I and lead out wires 2 being housed in an elongated container 3 made of a heat resistant. insulating material, such as quartz and crystallized glass. One end of each of said lead out wires 2 is led out of each end ot said container 3, and the container 3 is constricted as shown at a lead out portion 11 to provide a seal construction. In addition, the lead out wires 2 led out of the container 3 each have a lead wire 4 connected thereto.The container 3 has an inert gas, such as argon, enclosed therein after evacuation, sso as to prevent oxidation of said filament 1. A heating chamber 5 is divided by a partition net 5 into a main heating chamber 7 for receiving a food 6 and an auxiliary heating chamber 8 for receiving said container 3, and the partition net 51 has a number of openings of such a size that the net allows passage of infrared rays but blocks high frequency electromagnetic waves.The partition net 5 is disposed close to the container 3 and heavily irradiated with the radiant heat from the fila ment 1, so that it thermally expands to Åa large extent.Particularly, repetitive energization and deenergization of the filament 1 subjects the net to local deformation, particularly in prolonged operation, causing the net to rent or tear. If the partition net 5 tears, the high frequency electromagnetic waves fed from a magnetron 9, used as an example of a high frequency oscillator, to the main heating chamber 7 enter the auxiliary heating. chamber 8, causing not only spark breakage to the filament 1 but also leakage of high frequency electromagnetic waves into the outside of the heating chamber 5, which is a serious problem. Accordingly, in this embodiment of the invention, the opening defining edges 5A of the partition net 5 extending along the container 3 are bent into wave form, as shown in Eig. 5. Thus, since the partition net 5 is subjected to thermal expansion due to the heat from the filament 1 and since it is fixed at both ends thereof to the walls of the main heating chamber 5, bending stress is produced in the partition net 5 , but this stress.is distributed among the many bends or curves, so that the deformation.of each bend can be minimized. As a result, the danger of the partition net 5 being torn or otherwise damaged is eliminated, and so is the danger of leakage of high frequency electromagnetic waves.Further, the opposite walls of the auxiliary heating chamber 8 are each provided with a hole 8R for the opposite ends of said container 3 to extend therethrough. The leadout portions 11 of the lead out wires 2 at both ends of the container 3. project outside the heating chamber 5 through said holes 8A. The diameter of the holes 8A is larger than the outer diameter of said container 3 to give a generous allowance. In addition, said magnetron 9 and main heating chamber 7 are connected together by a wave guide 10. With the cooking appliance arranged in the manner described above, a food 6 put in the main heating chamber 7 is first dielectrically heated in the interior by the high frequency electromagnetic waves arom the magnetron and then it can be done to a beautiful brown in. a. short time by the radiant heat from the filament 1, which can be heated to a high temperature as soon as it is energized through the lead wires 4 and lead out wires 2. Since the filament 1 is heated to as high a temperature as 1,5000C or above, the temperature of the container 3 rises to about. 9000C or above and the upper surface of the auxiliary heating chamber 8 and the partition net 5 rise in temperature to 5000C or above. This brings about a big problem that the difference in thermal expansion coefficient between the container 3 and the lead out wires 2 causes damage to the lead out portions 11 at which said container 3 and lead out wires 2 contact each other, resulting in the outside air entering the container 3 to cause oxidation of the filament 1.However, according to the present embodiment, since the lead out portions 11 project outside the auxiliary heating chamber 8, they are cooled by the outside air and thereby maintained at low temperature, thus prolonging the service life of the filament 1. Also, since the lead out wires 2 do not generate heat, the temperature therearound is low and, although it is rather difficult to provide a sufficient insulating distance between the same and the wall of the auxiliary heating chamber 8, the temPerature is such that the insulating requirement for the container 3 is met. Quarlz or crystallized glass, which is a material of which the container 3 is made, rarely develops thermal ex passion even at a temperature as h igh as about l,0 000C, but the stainless steel or other metal plates, generally used for the walls of the auxiliary heating chamber 8 develop l.a.re thermal expansion even at a temperature of as low as about 5000C. Therefore, in the present embodiment, with considera tion given to such properties, opposite walls of the auxiliary heating chamber 8 are formed with holes 8A for receiving the container 3 therein, as previously described, so that even if the width of said auxiliary heating chamber 8 changes owing to heat, there is no danger of excess.ive.force acting on the container 3 to damage the latter. Opposite end portions of the container 3, as shown inFig. 3, extend through a double wall structure comprising a first heat insulating plate 12 of metal and a second heat insulating plate 13 of metal, with a heat insulating elastic body 14 beingtprovided therebetween for holding the container 3. Further, the distance.between said first and second heat insulating plates 12 and 13 is about 1 4 of the wave length Ag of the high frequency electromagnetic waves in the heat ing chamber 5, thus forming a portion of high impedce to high frequency electromagnetic waves.More particularly, even if said partition net 5 fails to block electromagnetic waves and the latter enter the auxiliary heating chamber 8, the . heat insulating plates 12 and 13 spaced a distance of AgXa apart selectively block them, preventing them from escaping outside the auxiliary heaving chamber 8, thus provided ing increased safety. The two heat insulating plates 12 and 13, together vJith theeelas.tic body 14, also serves to prevent the hot air in the auxiliary heating chamber 7 and main heat ing chamber 7 from escaping outside the heating chamber 5, thereby increasing the efficiency cf heating the food 6, making speedy cooking possible. They also prevent oil smoke and other gases from the food 6 from entering the machine chamber.in which the magnetron 9 and the like are installed.As a result, possibilities of insulation failure are precluded In addition, if metal pipes 12A are provided between the insulating plates 12 and 13 to extend along the container 3, as shown in F,ig a, a perfect Xg 4 choke construction is formed, heightening the high frequency electromagnetic wave leakage preventing effect. In addition, the front opening in the heating chamber 5 is adapted to be opened and closed by the door 15 and the heating chamber 15 is contained in a body case 16.INDUSTRIAL APPLICAB ILIT As described hereinbefore, according to the present invention, since the heater is sealed in the container, there is no possibility of said heater being oxidized and hence the heater can be heated to a very high temperature so as to quickly elevate the temperature of the atmosphere in the heating chamber and cooking can be accelerated with the intense radiant heat, achieving the corresponding amount of energy saving. Further, since the portions of the lead out wires which are led out of the container extend outside the heating chabr, there is no danger of said lead cut portions being damaged to allow entry of air into the container and hence there is ne possibility of the heater being oxidized. As a result, the service life of the heater is very long.
