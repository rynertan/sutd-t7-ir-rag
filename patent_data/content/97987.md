# Drive tensioning apparatus.

## Abstract
A tensioning apparatus 40 for a power transfer mechanism 19 utilizing an endless flexible member 30 having a normally slack run 36 and a normally taut run 34 is disclosed wherein the tensioning apparatus 40 is oper able to take up the slack in the endless member 30 under both normal operating conditions and reverse power condi tions during which the normally slack run 36 becomes taut and vice versa. The tensioning apparatus 40 varies the amount of tensioning force applied to each run 34,36 of the endless member 30 in response to the amount of tension within the respective run 34,36 . A constant biasing force is applied to a pair of tensioning idlers 41, 45 through an elongated rod 52 which positionally changes relative to the tensioning idler pivots 43,47 to vary the amount of tensioning force applied by the tensioning idlers 41,45 .
