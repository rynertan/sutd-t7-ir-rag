## Description
This invention relates to a carrycase for use with an infant. In particular, it relates to a carrycase which is suitable for carrying articles associated with an infant and is additionally adaptable to form a changing pad or a cot. When one is travelling with an infant, it is necessary to carry articles pertaining to the requirements of the infant. The amount of paraphernalia required when travelling with an infant can be considerable. It is an object of the present invention to provide a carrycase which is suitable for carrying the infant s paraphernalia and which is also convertible to a changing pad or a cot. The invention therefore provides a self supporting carrycase comprising six substantially rigid rectangular elements defining a base, a lid and four walls, the lid being hinged to one wall, characterised in that said one wall is hinged to the base and is detachably attachable to the two adjacent walls enabling said lid and said one wall to be unfolded into the plane of the base and placed, together with the base, on a supporting surface to form a working pad. It is preferred that at least the interior face of the lid, of said one wall and of the base are padded and waterproofed to render the working pad suitable for placement thereon of an infant requiring attention. In a preferred embodiment, the carrycase, opened out to form a working pad as set out above, includes provision for further conversion of the carrycase into a carry cot. Thus three further substantially rigid rectangular wall elements are provided and are adapted to form a continuous upstanding enclosure which embraces the exposed periphery of the working pad, and to form a stiffening support for said pad by detachable attachment thereto and to said two adjacent walls, which effects the desired conversion. The middle one of said three wall elements desirably comprises a flap hinged to the lid. The outer two of said elements may be hinged to respective opposite edges of the flap. Preferably however said outer two wall elements are discrete. When not in use as walls they may be stored in a pocket or two pockets provided in the carrycase. A preferred location for the pocket or pockets is in at least one of the lid and said one wall, either or both of which may comprise two adjacent layers defining the pocket or pockets between them. The means for detachable attachment of any one element to another preferably comprise a hinged flap projecting from the one and adapted to lie along an edge of the other element. The flap normally bears at least one press fastener element or toggle fastener element, and the edge bears a cooperating press or toggle fastener element respectively. Other types of openable fastener means may of course be used as alternatives. The carrycase desirably has a plurality of storage pockets on the internal faces of some at least of the wall elements, other than the one wall element which can form a part of the working pad. The pocket openings are preferably directed perpendicularly away from the working pad when said pad is extended and when the wall elements supporting the pockets are in use as wall elements. A conventional shoulder strap or the like is normally provided for carrying the carrycase in its capacity as such. A second strap may be provided for attachment parallel to the first strap to enable the carrycase to be lifted when it is serving as a carry cot. A hood may be provided, and, when not in use may be stored in one of the various pockets. The invention will be appreciated in greater detail from the following description of a specific and preferred embodiment given by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a carrycase Fig. 2 is a plan view of the carrycase of Fig. 1 in a partially unfolded condition Fig. 3 is a perspective view of the case of Fig. 2 further unfolded and unpacked Fig. 4 shows the case of Fig. 3 erected to form a cot and Fig. 5 is another perspective view of the cot of Fig. 4. Referring now to the drawings, a carrycase 1 comprises a base 2, side walls 3, a front wall 4, a rear wall 5, a lid 6 and a flap 7. A handle 8 which can be adjusted for length through a buckle 81 is attached to the side walls 3 by conventional means. Upwardly opening pockets 32 and 41 are attached to the inner faces of the side walls 3 and front wall 4 respectively. Flaps 51 and 61 extend from either end of the rear wall 5 and lid 6 respectively. Fastening means namely toggle fasteners 100 and snap fasteners 200 are located on the flaps 51 and 61, lid 6, sides 3 and front wall 4. In the closed condition of the carrycase 1, the compartment formed by the base 2, side walls 3, front wall 4 and rear wall 5 may be used to contain an infant s clothes. In addition, pockets 32 and 41 may contain the infant s bottles and other accessories. To open the carrycase, fasteners 100 located on the front wall 4 are released and the flap 7 is lifted and brought towards the rear of the case enabling the lid 6 to pivot along a hinge 300. In order to partially collapse the carrycase to form a flat changing pad, fasteners 100 and 200 on the flaps 51 and the sides 3 are released and further backward pulling on the flap 7 enables the rear wall 5 to pivot along a hinge 400. The base 2, rear wall 5, lid 6 and flap 7 now form a flat working or changing pad. To close the carrycase, the above recited procedure is carried out in reverse. The working pad can have a variety of uses.For example, when it is necessary to change the infant s clothes the infant may be placed on sections 2, 5 and 7 of the working pad with its head resting on the base 2. The infant lies on the pad with its legs extending towards the rear of the pad. Referring now to Figs. 3, 4 and 5, two supplementary wall elements 9, having toggle fasteners 100 and snap fasteners 200 and a hinged flap 91 at one end are attached to the four flaps 51 and. 61, the side walls 3 and the flap 7 to form an open topped rectangular cot 10. A second handle 82, which can be adjusted for length through a buckle 83, is secured to the lid 6 by conventional means. An open ended pocket 62, shown in dotted outline in the lid 6, may be used to store the handle 82 and one of the wall elements 9 when these are not required. A similar pocket 52, shown in dotted outline in the rear wall 5, may be used to store the other wall element 9.
