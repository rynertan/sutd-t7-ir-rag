# Labels for containers.

## Abstract
A method of continuously producing a series of tubular labeling sleeves 24 , characterised in that the method comprises the steps of a printing on each of the upper and lower outer faces 8, 14 of a flat tube 2 of resilient material a sequence of desired images, the image on the upper face 8 of the flat tube 2 being printed in register with the image on the lower face 14 of the flat tube 2 b removing the longitudinal edge portions of the flat tube from each of the two sides of the tube c forming at regular intervals a seal across the width of the resilient material so as to seal together the upper and lower sides of the tube, steps b and c being performed in either order and d severing the tube across its width along the resultant seal thereby to form a tubular sleeve 24 .
