# Pulley mechanism for fluid displacement apparatus.

## Abstract
A fluid displacement apparatus is disclosed. The apparatus includes a housing having a front end plate, a fixed member and an orbiting piston member. The fixed and orbiting piston members interfit to make a plurality of line contacts to define a sealed off fluid pocket. A driving mechanism, including a drive shaft, is disposed within the housing and is operatively connected to the orbiting piston member to effect the orbital motion of the orbital piston member by the rotation of the drive shaft. The drive shaft is rotatably supported by the front end plate through a bear ing. An annular sleeve projecting axially from a front end surface of the front end plate surrounds the drive shaft. A pulley member is fixed on an axial end of the drive shaft which extends from the sleeve and is rotatably supported by the sleeve through a bearing on the outer surface of the sleeve. The drive shaft is thus rotatably supported by the front end plate through two bearings, one within the front end plate and the other on the outer surface of the sleeve.
