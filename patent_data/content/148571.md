# LINE SPOOLING DEVICE

## Abstract
A line spooling device for spooling a line 30 on to a storage spool 11 in a build 31 in which each successive turn 32 of the line 30 on the spool 11 is laid adjacent the preceding turn in a traverse of the spool 11 first in one direction to form a first layer on the spool 11 and then in a traverse of the spool 11 in the opposite direction to form a superposed second layer on the spool 11 comprises a traversing guide pulley 29 for guiding the line 30 on to the spool 11 and a drive mechanism 21, 22, 25, 28 for driving the guide pulley 29 in a traverse of the spool 11 in one direction and then in a traverse in the opposite direction to present the line 30 to the spool 11 at winding on positions corresponding to those for the build 31 thereon of a line of predetermined gauge. The drive mechanism 21, 22, 25, 28 is made responsive to side loading of the guide pulley 29 by the line 30 resulting from a misalignment of the position of the guide pulley 29 with the position at which the line 30 is being wound on the spool 11 to cause a variation in the drive transmitted to the guide pulley 29 in a sense to reduce the misalignment.
