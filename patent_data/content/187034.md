# PROCESS FOR PRODUCING POLY 1 BUTENE

## Abstract
A process for producing poly 1 butene which comprises polymerizing 1 butene in the presence of a lower hydrocarbon at a temperature in the range of from 20 to 45 C by using a polymerization catalyst composed of A a solid catalyst component containing as essential constituents a metal oxide, magnesium, halogen, and titanium B an organic compound of a metal belonging to Groups I to III of the Periodic Table and C an electron donor compound.
