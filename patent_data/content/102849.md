# Yarn winding apparatus.

## Abstract
In winding a yarn Y onto a bobbin 7 , a more uniform package can be obtained by the alternate steps of a repeatedly traversing the yarn Y over a full traverse stroke Wo and b repeatedly traversing the yarn Y over a narrower traverse stroke W. During step b the yarn Y is released from the traverse guide means 10 20 25 at the end of the stroke, whereupon it tends to traverse naturally towards a mid position until picked up by the traverse guide means 10 20 25 on its return stroke. The release is effected by yarn release guides 16a, 16b 27a, 27b which can be moved to a position where the yarn Y is deflected to a path where it is out of contact with the traverse guide means 16a, 16b 27a, 27b at a position corresponding to the ends of the narrower traverse stroke W.
