## Description
TELEPHONE SE FOR PUBLIC USE HAVING AN INTEGRAL MANAGEMENT MICROPROCRSSOR This invention relates to a telephone set for public use which can be enabled by means of tokens and different value coins and has a single slot to receive said different value coins as well as conventional telephone tokens, it being adapted to cash or return them on a cash optimization basis, as described in the European Patent Application N84lI56O5.2 of December 17, 1984 by the same Applicant. Current telephone sets for public use are provided with many devices independent of one another, each intended for performing a specific function. Thus, as an example, the numbers are dialed either on a dialing disk or storage type keyboard which are enabled by the hook contacts and a dedicated device sensing the presence of coins or tokens in the respective storage channels the coin collect or return function is effected by an electromechanical member activated by exchange pulses and the hook contacts the supply of tower to the set is ensured by the biasing exchange voltage and a local battery. The net result is a complicated structure, hardly suited to meet current requirements of automated management with which also telephony tends to conform. The aim of this invention is that of simplifying the structure of the public telephone set, changing it from tun aggregate of discrete selfcontained devices into an intelligent terminal, i,ev one provided with an own control logic unit which can process all the signals to and from the set in order to optimize and simplify its control. Within the above general aim, this invention is directed to achieve the following important particular objects allowing for connection of the set to the central exchange through the telephone loop alone, eliminating the need for an operating loop indifferently allowing the set to be interfaced on the telephone line with the output of reverse polarity billing pulses, or on the line with the output of off band frequency 12 16kEs billing pulses making the set suitable for receiving several coins or tokens with different face values through a single inlet slot providing the set with self diagnosis abilities, with automatic warning to the central exchange, for malfunctions or special situations, through automatic dialing of a telephone number programmed within the set itself providing the set with the ability to perform communications on special services through dialing of free of charge numbers programmed within the set and acknowledged thereby providing the set with the ability to recover the telephone line for a new call with related new dialing without the need to hang up ensuring the sets operation with a small absorption of current from the line, e.g. an absorption not exceeding 15 mA and allowing programming of basic parameters as charge of each time unlit, free of charge numbers, the automatic call number for malfunctions, both directly inside the set and by intervention from the central exchange. For the achievement of these important objects, as well as of others appearing from the detailed description that follows, this invention has for its subject a telephone set for public use, characterized in that it comprises a microprocessor type local logic unit operatively linked to, and directly controlling the following peripheral units a dailing keyboard connected directly to the microprocessor, which confirms the actuated keys and effects the selection of the dailled number on the telephone line a coin sorter having an electronic sorting section which supplies the microprocessor with a coin introduction acknowledge signal and a coin value signal a coin receiving device interposed between the sorter and a storage channel and being activated directly by the microprocessor to either block each coin or admit it into said storage channel sensor means responsive to the presence of at least one coin or token in the storage channel, to the coins moving through the collect channel, and to the residual capacity of the collecting box, said sensor means being connected to the microprocessor to output corresponding signals to the latter a cash or return device located at the outlet end of the storage channel and controlled by the microprocessor to either cash or return each stored coin a billing pulse detector anon hook simulator member, activated by the microprocessor for a set time period on opening the hook contacts, for re connection to the line on hanging up and for receiving from said line the actuating power for the stored coin cash and return members at least one main power supply for the microprocessor and the other means, members and devices as mentioned above, energized through one of the hook contacts a microprocessor reset member, activated by the microprocessor at the end of the operations to ensure that the supply voltage drops below a set value. A preferred embodiment of the invention will be now described, given herein by way of non limitative example in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, where Figure 1 is a perspective view of a telephone set according to a preferred embodiment of the invention Figure 2 is a block diagram of the telephone set of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a diagram of the circuits interfacing the microprocessor of Figure 2 with the telephone loop and Figures 4,5,6,7 and 8 are flow diagrams clarifYing the operation of the inventive telephone set, With reference to Figure 1, a telephone set according, to this invention comprises a case 10 housing electronic and electromechanical members to be described hereinafter a handset 12 linked via a small 7exible cable 14 with the setts internal circuits and normally hanging from a hook 16 operative to activate the internal members, as described hereinafter a single coin or telephone token introduction slot 18 a liquid crystal alphanumeric display 20 and a numerical keyboard 22, both mounted on the case front and a line recovery key RL located beside the keyboard or incorporated to it. Housed in the case 10 there also is a coin return box 26.The set is connected to a conventional telephone loop as schematically indicated at 28. With reference now to Figure 2, the electronic and electromechanical members inside the case 10 will be described These members are all controlled by a microprocessor 30, preferably of the CMOS, 8 bit word type, with a timer, and a RAM integrated with theCPU, such as the Model 6805 manufactured by aIotorola. The timer supplies by µ interrupt1 all the time periods required for the set to operate, as explained hereinafter, The microprocessor 30 is provided with I O lines addressable from the C. A preferably externally located or 32, containing the operative program, is connected to the microprocessor via a data blis 31 and address bus 33. The oaee 10 further houses a main power apply 34 which supplies the operating voltage to the micro processor and the various members through appropriate oonventional oonnections not shown for clarity, and is in turn powered from the loop 28 through a rectifying diode bridge 35, a line opening relay RAL, which is normally closed, a bistable switch SG for on hook simulation, a conventional speech circuit 39, and a normally open hook contact G1, the state of which ie sensed by microprocessor 30 through line 49. The RAL is driven by the microprocessor through a wire lead 36.In its working position, the on hook simulatorSG causes the hook contact G1 to be bypassed from the circuit for reasons which will be explained herein, after0 The bridge 35 has the purpose of supplying at all times the appropriate polarity to the power supply 34, even if the two wires of the loop are exchanged, thus rendering the set linking independent of any manipulations performed at the central exchange. Upstream of the hook contact G1, there is also connected a second auxiliary power supply 38 which powers the display 20 through circuits not shown for clarity. The auxiliary power supply 38 is arranged to be coupled in parallel relationship to the main power supply 34, via a second hook contact G2 to be described hereinafter with reference to Figure 3, with the handset 12 removed from the hook, thereby contributing toward stepping up the power supplied to meet the high, short duration, power requirements of some electromechanical members. Also lIiA ed to the speech circuit 39 is an acoustic signal generator 44 driven by the microprocesser 30 A billing pulse detector 40, in the worm of a reverse polaritJr sensor, as obvious for those skilled in the art, is connected directly to the 1 QP 28 and supplies the microprocessor 30, through a wire lead 42, with a signals when the loop changes its polarity. Where the billing pulses are passed to the central exchange, rather than by reversal of the polarity, by means of a 12 or 16Ez carrier, a separate known detector 40 would be provided, which is interchangeable without any further alterations of the circuits. The microprocessor has an octal output connected to the input of a scaling integrated circuit 52, which parallely drives the display 20 in a manner known per se Another input output group of eight wires is connected to the keyboard 22 with a matrix link with a wire lead reserved for the line recovery key RL. A coin sorting device 56, of a type known per se, is coordinated with the slot 18 to receive the coins and tokens introduced, aolinowledging their validity and value. The sorter is connected to the interrupt lineIST of the icroprooessor 30, to actuate it on acknow lodging a valid coin, and is also connected to a multiple ine line of the microprocessor to provide a coded indication of the coin value. Provided at the output of the sorter 56 is a coin accepting mechanism 58, comprising a solenoid driven by the microprocessor 30 and normally not supplied to allow the coin to drop into the return box 26 through a passageway not shown for clarity, it being adapted to be energized to lift a door 59 and guide the coin to a coin storage or collecting channel 60. The latter is constructed such that coins being introduced arrange themselves in a row therealong, while remaining taFgen tial to each other. The channel 60 is provided with an upper or head sensor 62 and a lower or end sensor 64, adapted to detect the presence of a coin respectively at the head or upper extremity and end or lower extremity of the channel 60.The sensors 62 and 64 are preferably cooperating pairs of LEDtsand phototransistors whose light beam crosses the coin path in the channel. The outlet of the channel 60 is normally closed by a bidirectional cash unit 68 adapted to be controlled by the microprocessor to open the outlet of the channel 60, to direct the leading coin to a cash channel 70 or a return channel 72, according to the command, for discharging the coin respectively into a collecting box 74 or the return box 26, as already mentioned with reference to Figure 1. The passage of the coin through the collecting channel 70 is detected by a cash check sensor 76 eg. of the same te as the sensors 62 and 64 , close to the channel bottom, for fraud prevening purposes.Another sensor 78, such as a strain gage, senses the weight of the collecting box 74 for determining whether it is full. In Figure 3, there is shown in further detail the circuitry of a portion of the diagram of Figure 2, concerning interfacing of the microprocessor 30 with the telephone loop 28. Each of the power supplies 34,38 comprises on its output a respective voltage stabilizing 2enter Z12 Z2 or functionally equivalent circuit and a respective smoothing capacitor C1,C2, so as to be able on the one hand to supply the operating voltage to the microprocessor 30 over short periods even while removed from the loopw and on the other hand to supply momentary current peaks for actuating the electromechanical members without excessively loading the telephone line. With the handset unhooked, the hook contacts G1,G2 supply line voltage to the auxiliary power supply 38, while the connection is opened with the main power supply 34 inoperative. In that condition, the diode 50 uncouples from the auxiliary power supply that portion of the circuit including inter alia the microprocessor 30 which is unrelated to the display 20. In parallel with diode 50 is a second normally open contact of the relayRAL, for the purpose of keeping the microprocessor fed during the periods lasting about 1 second when the RAL is opened to disconnect the set from the central exchange. The auxiliary power supply 38 is also connected to the line through a resistor 88 designed to admit a very low current, e.g. up to 60 pAt adequate to keep the capacitor C2 charged to supply the reduced current required to operate the display. In a more sophisticated embodiment, the resistor 88 could comprise a dipole constructed according to conventional techniques to have an increasing resistance as the potential difference across it decreases, thereby providing a stronger current when the capacitor C2 is discharged, and reducing the current down to neglibile values when the capacitor C2 is charged and the auxiliary power supply is no longer subjected to a high current absorption from the load. Furthermore, on lifting the handset, when the two power supplies are paralleled through the hook contacts G1,G2, capacitor C2 having a higher capacitance than the capacitor C1 is discharged to the latter to quickly bring the main power supply voltage to a sufficient value to operate the microprocessor. Serially connected between the hook contact G1 and the main power supply is also a reset RR contact, the coil REB whereof is controlled by the microprocessor 30 through a transistor 80 to close the smoothing capacitor C1 to the coil itself while disconnecting at the same time the power supply 34 from the telephone line , for quickly discharging the voltage of the latter capacitor when no longer in use, for reasons to be explained. The switching of the hook on and off is detected by the microprocessor as a change of voltage across a resistor 86. The actuator 82 of the bistable on hook simulatorSG is controlled by the microprocessor through a pair of complementary transistors 84, through a dedicated line. The operations performed by the microprocessor 30 while the telephone set is in operation will be next described, said operations corresponding to instructions stored into the ROM 32. When the telephone set is inoperative, i.e. with the handset hung up, the hook contact G1 is open and the main power supply 34 off. Therefore, the microprocessor 30 will be inactive, as Will all of the members controlled by it, except for the display 20 and associated IC 52, which are powered by the auxiliary power supply 38 which is p,ermanently connected to the telephone loop , to display the date loaded by the microprocessor into the circuit 52 before going off at the end of the last previous operation. On lifting the handset 12, the hook contact G1 will establish the connection of the main power supply 34 to the microprocessor 30 and other telephone members, while resetting the CP to start the program stored in the ROX 32, the main flow diagram whereof is shorn inFigure 4. The microprocessor 30 will first carry out an initializing routine INIT, shown in the diagram ofFigure 5. It comprises a diagnostic step, for checking that the collecting box is not full via sensor 78 , that there are no coins in the channel via sensor 62 , and that the cash checking sensor 76 is de actuated.If one of these conditions is detected, the microprocessor 30 selects a predetermined central exchange number, sets an Out of order flag S and indicates that state to the user on the display 20. The routine INIT comprises further an initialization step proper whereby the memories are cleared, the loop rest polarity is stored, and the ready condition is displayed on the display 20. At any time daring the telephone use i.e. with the handset lifted , the microprocessor may receive an interrupt from the sorter 56 to receive coins and keep a count of the coins introduced. For improved versatility, the microprocessor, additionally to storing a map of the coins introduced, in the form of a FIFO stack, and the total C of the ramiing credit, also calculates each time the physical length of the row of coins in the channel, summing the coin diameters for which the program contains the values according to any face values accepted by the set.Thus, the number of the coins that may be contained into the channel may vary according to the face value. On receiving the interrupt the microprocessor will carry out a coin accepting routine SEL, shown in Figure 6. It compares the length LO of the channel to the actual length L of the row of coins calculated as the sum of the diameters of the previously accepted coins , as increased by the value smax the largest receivable coin diameter. If the resulting length of the row of coins exceeds the space available in the channel, the microprocessot will return tonin Es and remain inactive, while the coin not guided to the channel will fall down and be returned to the box 26.Otherwise, the microprocessor would energize the accepting solenoid for a sufficient time to allow the passage of a single coin, check that the end sensor 64 of the ohannel ie obscured and disabled just for thetime required for a coin to move past, and then update itz accounting, loading into the PIFO map the value of the accepted coin, increasing the credit total C by the same amount, and increasing the actual length L of the row of coins in the channel by the value D of the diameter of the accepted coin. On completion of the routine INIT, athe microprocessor will execute a routine DIGIT of acquisition and seldetion of the digits of the telephone number dialled by the user, the flow diagram wherefor is shown in Figure 7. This consists of a keyboard read routine TAST, which is anti bouncing and anti repetition in conformity with knows techniques in the art which will be omitted from this description. The routine TAST is repeated until a key is sensed. For each digit acknowledged, a check is made on its belonging to at least one in a table of freeof charge numbers, by activating a routine iS to send to the line dia L2Ag pulses corresponding to the digit sensed. Such pulses are generated by opening and closing the relay RAL for predetermined time periods shorter than the opening time required to disconnect the set from the central exchange . This routine will not be described in detail, it being obvious to those akilled in the art. If the number is not free ofcharge, and if the flag FS is set, the routine goes back to the block TASK, because no other operations are admitted in the Out oi orderw state. Otherwise, the routine DIGIT lastly will check if at least one coin is present in the channel, prior to giving its consent for the output of the dialling pulses. After dialling each digit, return is made to the routine DIGIT until a Datum Ready is sensed. With reference now to the main diagram of Figure 4, the program now reads the billing pulse detector 40, and if a pulse has been received, it cries out the credit checking rbutine CC Figure 8 increasing the billing total T and calculating the new leftover credit R as the difference between the total available credit C determined in a manner to be explained and the billing total T. biter checking that the coin has not been deceiptively withdrawn from the channel, the routineCO will display the actual running credit R.If no coin is present in the channel, the routine CC sets the Out of order flag, displays this state, and opens the relay RAL for approximately 1 second in order to dis connect the set from the central exchange. Referring back to the diagram of Figure 4, the program checks now whether the channel is full, by comparing the actual length L of the row of coins to the rated or nominal length LC of the channel, d in that case, should the value M1 of the leading coin be smaller than the leftover credit, it will collect that coin, by driving the cash magnet 68, removing M1 from the FIFO stack in RAM, decreasing both T and C by the value Mi, and decreasing the actual length L of the row of coins by the value D1 of the diameter of the collected coin.Thus, in this way the microprocessor will be able to accept the next coin introduced through the slot 18, to permit calls to arbitrary amounts independent of the maximum credit materially containable in the channel. The program checks now whether the leftover credit R is nil, opening in that case the RAL otherwise it checks whether the leftover credit is less than 2 billing units, activating in that case the leftover credit blinking on the display and momentarily energizing the acoustic signal generator 44 to warn the user. Otherwise, the program checks if the line recovery key RS has been pressed.In that case it will open the RAL for about 1 second to disconnect the set from the central exchange and revert to the routine DIGIT to receive another number for a new talk. If the key RL has not been pressed, the program checks whether the handset has been hung up. In the negative case, it returns to the block IT otherwise, since the use of the set has been terminated, the microprocessor energizes, if the call made was not addressed to a free of charge number, the on hook simulator SG, reconnecting to the loop to carry out the cash routineINC. The cash routine is optimized to collect the lowest credit value which is greater than or equal to the billing total. The cash criteria are described in the European Patent Application N0 84115605.2 ofDeoember T7, 1984 by this same Applicant and reference is made to it for a better understandiDg of the invention, while omitting here a detailed description thereof. After the cash routine the microprocessor 30 will open the RAL for the time required to disconnect the set from the central exchange about 1. second , and then let the RAL fall back to the closed position, and will finally energize the reset relay RIL which shorts out the capacitor C1 of the main power supply Figure 3 to cause the supply voltage to quickly drop below the wicertainty threshold and to drive the microprocessor to rest, tbus avoiding unforeseeable behaviors of the microprocessor. It will be appreciated that the invention achieves its objects, avoiding in particular the need for a local battery, thanks to the use of a low absorption auxiliary power supply for operating the display only avoiding the need for an operating loop, thanks to. the elimination of interferences between the set and the central exchange, obtained by employing the on hook simulator which allows the connection with the central exchange to be continued after the utilization has terminated. A preferred embodiment of the invention has been described, but of course, it will be susceptible to many modifications and changes bg the replacement with equivalent technical means within the purview of the inventive idea. For example, the BOM 32 containing the program could be integrated to the microprocessor instead v being external, as could be integrated other functional blocks, such as the acoustic indicator 44 or the pulse detector 40. Also the display 20, together with its drive circuit 52, could be embodied differently, e.g. as an electrochromic display Some of the parts described could be omitted for instance, in some situations, the auxiliary power supply could be dispensed with,f6r example, in the instance where the display is in fact of the electrochromic type.Likewise, the acoustic generator 44 could be omitted, or one or more of the sensors 62,64,76,78 if one or more of them is not required for anti fraud purposes, such as where the sorter 56 or some other coin handling member is provided to perform that function. Changes and modifications may also be made in the functions performed by the microprocessor, also in relation to the requirements of the telephone agency of the country to which the telephone is to be supplied. For example, if no free of charge numbers are provided, the dialling routine DIGI is corresponding simplified, or such numbers, instead of being pre loaded into the ROM could be received each time from the central exchange and loaded into the RRM, in which case the initialization routine INFIX should be suitably modified. Again, the Out of ordert condition could completely disable the set, instead of still allowing free of charge number diaLing as envisaged in the preferred embodiment. All these and other variations are to be regarded as encompassed by the inventive idea as defined in the appended claims.
