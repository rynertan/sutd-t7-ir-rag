## Description
BackgroundThis invention relates to lithographic printing plates with visible images and to a process for making such plates.Lithographic printing techniques, using, for example, anodized and silicated aluminum base plates such as described in Fromson patent No. 3,181,461 issuedMay 4,1965, have come into widespread use in the printing industry and especially in offset printing and direct lithographic printing by newspapers using converted letterpress printing presses.A conventional negative working lithographic printing plate of this type has a coating of a light sensitive substance that is adherent to the aluminum base sheet for exposure. If the light sensitive coating is applied to the base sheet by the manufacturer, the sheet is referred to as a presensitized plate . If the light sensitive substance is applied to the base by the lithographer or trade plate maker, the plate is referred to as a wipe on plate . Depending on the nature of the photosensitive coating employed, a coated plate may be utilized to reproduce directly the image to which it is exposed, in which case it is termed a positive acting plate, or to produce an image complementary to the one to which it is exposed, in which case it is termed a negative acting plate. In either case, the image area of the developed plate is oleophilic and the non image area is hydrophilic.In the case of negative working plate, the surface is coated with an aqueous solution of a conventional diazo resin. The plate is dried and exposed through a negative.The exposed image areas become water insoluble and the unexposed non image areas remain water soluble.The plate is conventionally developed with a lithographic lacquer which consists of a two phase system, one phase containing an oleophilic resin in a solvent and the other phase a hydrophilic gum.Upon application, the oleophilic resin adheres to and makes visible the exposed insoluble areas, while the hydrophilic phase dissolves away the unexposed soluble non image or background areas. In this way, the visible image is made oleophilic or ink receptive and the background is made hydrophilic or ink repellent.In our companion application, Serial No. 064,322 filed August 6, 1979, we describe the simultaneous chemical amplification of diazo sensitized plates using an anionic material in an ionizing reaction medium.This provides a water developable plate and eliminates the use of conventional solvent resin containing lacquers. In the present invention we provide a lithographic substrate and plate that produces a visible image upon development without relying on a component of the developer to become adhered to the image area. SUMMARYThe present invention provides an aluminum lithographic substrate which has been treated to render the surface hydrophilic and negatively charged and thereafter ionically colored with a cationic dye.The invention further provides an aluminum printing plate the surface of which has been treated to render it hydrophilic and negatively charged and then coated simultaneously or sequentially with a light sensitive, cationic, positively charged diazonium material and a cationic dye. The coated surface is capable of having its solubility altered upon exposure to actinic light and thereafter developed to produce a visible, dyed image and a hydrophilic background free of the diazonium material and dye.This invention further provides a dyed anodized aluminum article. Normally, anodized aluminum is dyed using anionic and non ionic dyes. Up to now, cationic dyes could not be used because the surface of anodized aluminum is either neutral or acid.It has now been discovered that anodized aluminum can be effectively dyed or colored with a cationic dye by first tnBting the anodized aluminum to render the surface thereof anionic. This makes it now possible to color code products and provide a visible image on a lithographic plate without interfering with the developing process or altering the lithographic properties of a plate.It has been proposed to use an anionic dye on an anodized aluminum substrate for lithographic purposes U.S. Patent Number 3 280 734 . However, this was not commercially successful because the dye remained in the background after developing which caused scumming and toning during printing.The present invention employs a cationic dye for anodized aluminum which is ionically removed from the background during development of the plate, while the color remains permanently in the image area after exposure and development, without undergoing any change during either process. This results in a visible image, with the substrate ionically colored in the image area, and a suitable lithographic background hydrophylic and oleophobic which has been ionically cleared of the cationic dye. DESCRIPTIONCationic dyes used in the invention can be applied to the negatively charged substrate or incorporated in the light sensitive material to provide a visible image on the plate. Suitable dyes include basic cationic dyes such as Victoria Green, Rhodamine B, Rhodamine 5GLD, crystal violet, extra pure APN, Paper Blue R and the like.Cationic light sensitive materials that can be used in the invention are diazonium materials having reactive sites capable of being chemically altered by light or chemically reacted with an anionic material.For example, 4 diazo diphenylamine condensed with a carbonyl compound such as formaldehyde has the needed multiplicity of reactive sites each having the desired dual functionality. Preferred are water soluble diazonium compounds but water insoluble compounds can also be used. Suitable diazonium compounds are described in U.S. 3,849,392 to Steppan and U.S. 3,311,065 toSteppan. Suitable anionic materials are water soluble and include the alkali metal salts of alkylaryl sulfonates having 1 to 20 carbon atoms in the alkyl portion and 6 to 14 carbon atoms in the aryl portion, alkali metal salts of alkyl sulfonates having 12 to 20 carbon atoms and ammonium and alkali metal salts of sulfated higher fatty alcohols having 10 to 20 carbon atoms.Anionic materials are dissolved in an ionizing reaction medium usually water and the concentration of the anionic material is sufficient to couple with the light sensitive material and to dissolve the coupled reaction product from the unexposed areas.Specific examples of anionic surfactants are given herein together with a test to determine suitability.The aluminum substrate is treated to render the surface hydrophilic and anionically charged. The preferred lithographic substrate is anodized aluminum which may be pretreated before anodizing to roughen or grain the surface, for example using mechanical, chemical or electrochemical techniques as are well known in the art and it may be post treated after anodizing.It is preferred to impart hydrophilicity and a negative charge by silicating as described in Fromson patentNo. 3,181,461.After treatment with the anionic material, the image can be reinforced with an oleophilic W curable material which can be coated on and then cured. This is described in copending application Serial No. 972,567, filed December 22, 1978, which is incoporated herein by way of reference.Suitable UV curable materials are commercially available from a number of sources in the form of W curable inks, coatings,oligomers and monomers. Such commercially available materials can be obtained from the following companies Inmont Corporation, Sinclair Valentine, CelaneseChemical Company, 3 M Company, Desoto Chemical Company,Paulimer Industries, Shell Chemical, Mobile Chemical,W.R.Grace, Design Coat Company and Ware ChemicalCorporation.UV curable materails including monomers and oligomers are described in the following patents U.S. 3,297,745 1967 U.S. 3,380,381 1968 U.S. 3,673,140 1972 U.S. 3,770,643 1972 U.S. 3,712,871 1973 U.S. 3,804,736 1974There are also materials that will cure upon exposure to other sources of radiation, for example an electron beam. These curable materials can be used in special applications in place of the UV material and are commercially available. Electron beam curable compositions are described in U.S. patents 3,586,526 30, 1971.Producing a visible image by chemical amplification after exposure to actinic radiation makes it possible to substantially reduce exposure times normally required with diazonium compounds. This can be expressed empirically as simply the amount of actinic light necessary to produce an image capable of running on a lithographic press. Chemical amplification makes it possible to reduce the amount of light needed to attain this by a factor of from 2 to 10 or more. This means that a diazo sensitized plate that normally required 1 or 2 minutes to image can be imaged in a matter of seconds. The amount of diazo on the plate can also be reduced.The amount of light necessary to produce an image capable of running on a lithographic press can also be expressed in terms of millijoules per square centimeter.The amount of actinic light can be from less than about 100 to as little as 5 millijoules cm2 at W wave lengths of 300 400 nanometers. This means that plates can be exposed with low power lasers such as are marketed by EOCOM Inc. and developed to produce a visible image.After treatment with the preferred anionic material, the developed amplified image can be blanket exposed to actinic light to photo react any remaining light sensitive sites in the image area. This includes coupled diazonium and anionic materials which remain light sensitive after coupling.A test to determine whether a particular anionic material is suitable is as follows A 5 aqueous solution of the anionic material is pared. An aluminum lithographic plate grained, anodized, and silicated is coated with a 1 solution of a light sensitive diazo condensation product such as Fairmont s Chemical Diazo 4 . The coated plate is exposed to a Stouffer Graphic Arts Guide for a relatively short period of time 5 to 10 seconds.The exposed plate is immersed in the 5 solution of anionic material for 10 seconds. The plate is then rinsed and lacquered with a standard lithographic lacquer such as Fairmont s Black Lacquer . Another plate, identically prepared and exposed, is treated with theBlack Lacquer only. This is the control. The two plates are compared. If the anionic material is effective, the post treated plate will show significant difference in light sensitivity versus the control. The effectiveness of certain anionic materials can be enhanced by either a pH adjustment and or the use of a co solvent. The optimum pH for most anionic materials useful in this invention is in the range of pH 2 10. Suitable co solvents are alcohols such as ethanol, butanol and the like and glycols.Many different salts of anionic materials are suitable these include sodium, lithium, ammonium, or triethanol amine salts and the like.

EXAMPLE 1 control A 1 solution of the formaldehyde condensation product of a diphenylamine 4 diazonium zinc chloride double salt Fairmont Diazo Resin 4 is prepared in water.The solution is placed in a two roll coating machine.A brushed grained, anodized and silicated plate, 10 x 16 x 0,12 Ano Coil Delta Plate is coated face down through the machine. The coated plate is dried and placed in a Nu Arc Plate Maker exposure unit, 24 inches from the source 4 kw lamp . A StoufferGraphic Arts Step scale is step exposed on the plate for the following times 1 second, 5 seconds,10 seconds, 15 seconds, 30 seconds and 60 seconds. The exposed plate is then developed with Fairmont s black lacquer for wipe on plates. After development, rinsing, and drying the solid step exposure level is read for each exposure time 1 second no image, 5 seconds no image, 10 seconds a ghost image, 15 seconds a solid 1, 30 seconds a solid 3, and 60 seconds a solid 5 normal for this type of plate system. EXAMPLE 2A brush grained, anodized silicated aluminum plate Alloy 1100 is immersed in a dye bath of a 1 solution of a basic cationic dye such as DuPont sVictoria Green Liquid, Rhodamine B Liquid, Rhodamine 5 GLD, crystal violet extra pure APN or Paper BlueR Liquid. The dyed plate is then coated as in Example 1.The coated plate is then exposed in a 4 kw Nu Arc flip top exposure unit for 5 seconds to a newspaper page negative. The exposed, dyed plate is immersed in a 5 solution of sodium lauryl sulfate. Immediately upon removal from the bath a strong visible image is seen on the plate. EXAMPLE 3A brushed grained, silicated, and anodized plate Ano Coil s Delta Plate is coated with a 1 diazo coating Fairmont Resin 24 containing 1 2 Victoria Green Liquid dye DuPont . The plate is dryed and exposed for 5 seconds on a Nu Arc as inExample 7. The plate is developed in a 5 solution of ammonium lauryl sulfate. Upon application of the developer with a sponge, a visible image becomes immediately apparent. EXAMPLE 4A lithographic plate Ano Coil s Delta plate is dyed in a 1 solution of Victoria Green Liquid. The plate is coated with a 1 8 solution of Fairmont diazo resin 4 exposed to a newspaper negative for 10 seconds and immersed in a 5 solution of sodium lauryl sulfate.Immediately an image becomes visible. The plate is rinsed in tap water and dryed. The plate is placed on a Goss Metro Press and 50,000 good images are obtained. EXAMPLE 5A plate is prepared as in Example 2 but after development it is rubbed with a W curable emulsion Example 6 rinsed, dryed, and re exposed through a PPG W processor at 25 ft. minute. The plate is placed on aGoss Metro newspaper press and 250,000 impressions are obtained. EXAMPLE 6A brush grained, anodized, silicated, aluminum plate is coated with a 1 solution of water soluble polyfunctional diazo resin Fairmont s diazo resin µ4 containing 1 2 Victoria Green liquid dye as inExample 2 and dryed. The sensitized plate is then placed in an Eocom Laserite Platemaker and scanned with an ion argon laser. A scanning time of 1 minute is necessary to scan a plate approximately 23 x 14.The approximate laser power at the plate surface is 8 mj cm2. After scanning, the plate is developed with a 5 solution of sodium lauryl sulfate as inExample 2 to prduce a strong quality visible image. EXAMPLE 7A plate was coated, laser exposed and developed 2 as in Example 5 using 10 mj cm laser ppwer. This time after development, the plate was rubbed with the following W curable emulsion A 30 grms Inmont W Blue Ink 12,5 cc Span 80 I.C.I. 120 mls Cellosolve Acetate B 250 mils So Be Gum Arabic 12,5 grms Pluronic F38 BASF Mix by adding B to A while stirring. The emulsion can be applied with sponge, cloth,or brush. After treatment with the W emulsion the plate is re exposed in a high intensity W processor such as a PPGIndustries, Model PC2502A at 25ft minute. A tough and abrasion resistant visible image is produced. EXAMPLE 8A plate as described in Example 5 was dyed with a cationic water soluble dye, 1 Victoria Green DuPont . The plate was coated with a 1 solution of diazo resin and dryed. This plate was laser exposed as in 2Example 5 with laser power of 4 mj cm2, After exposure to the laser, the plate is developed by hand with sodium lauryl sulfate 5 solution .The thus treated plate is then lacquered with a black lacquer from Western Litho Company Jet Black .A dense black image results. EXAMPLE 9An aluminum sheet Alloy 1100 is degreased using a commercially formulated degreasing compound such asAlded Wyandotte Chemical Company . The plate is degreased at 180 to 1850 F for 30 seconds at a concentration of 6 to 8 ounces gallon. Next the plate is rinsed and anodized for 50 AMP minutes using sulfuric acid 280 grams liter at 900 F , rinsed and silicated with sodium silicate 3 , rinsed and finally dyed with a cationic dye such as Rodamine 5GLD Dupont at 4 grams liter. The dyed sheet is rinsed in tap water for several minutes and then dryed. A brightly colored aluminum sheet results.The dye can be easily discharged using an anionic surfactant 5 such as sodium lauryl sulfate. EXAMPLE 10An aluminum sheet is degreased, rinsed, and silicated as in Example 9 but not anodized. The anionically charged surface is then dyed with a cationic dye such as Dupont s Paper Blue R Liquid 5 cc liter at room temperature for one minute. A blue sheet results. The dye is resistant to rinse water but is easily discharged by immersion in a 5 solution of sodium lauryl sulfate. EXAMPLE 11A sheet of aluminum is degreased and anodized asIn Example 9 but not silicated and a second sheet is degreased, anodized, and silicated as in Example 9.Both sheets are then immersed for 30 seconds in a 1 solution of copper BF, an anionic dye, Sanddz at 1600 F and a pH of 5.5. The first sheet which is not silicated and therefore cationically charged takes the dye readily. The second sheet which is silicated will not dye. The first sheet is immersed in 5 anionic surfactant to see if the dye can be removed. It will not discharge with this treatment.
