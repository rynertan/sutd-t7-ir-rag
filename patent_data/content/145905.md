# Shaped beam antenna.

## Abstract
A shaped beam antenna of the type comprising a main reflector 30 and a feed horn 20 for irradiating an electro magnetic wave upon said main reflector 30 , the main reflector 30 including, in sectional planes inclusive of a Y Z plane and planes parallel thereto, a central section and horizontal side end sections adjoining the central section, where Cartesian coordinates are assumed having an origin near the feed horn 20 , a Z axis extending in a direction of the horizontal center axis of the feed horn 20 , and X and Y axes extending in planes perpendicular to the Z axis. The central section has a plurality of torus reflector segments 34, 37, 38 and each of the side end sections has a plurality of parabolic reflector segments 35 1, 36 1, 39 1, 35 2, 36 2, 39 2 ,and the torus and parabolic reflector segments are grouped into first and second portions, the first portion having the reflector segments 34, 35 1, 35 2 which are symmetrical with respect to the Y Z plane, the second por tion having first and second sub portions, the reflector seg ments 37, 36 1, 35 2, 38, 39 1, 39 2 of the first and second sub portions being asymmetrical with respect to the Y Z plane, whereby the maximum radiation direction of the beam reflected from the first portion lies in the Y Z plane, and the maximum radiation direction of the beam reflected from the second portion lies in planes other than the Y Z in plane.
