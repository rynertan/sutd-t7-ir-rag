# Blood diluent.

## Abstract
An improved multi purpose blood diluent is provided which is isotonic, with a neutral pH for avoiding cell volume change. The diluent of the invention provides balance between the effects on cell volume of a preservative for the solution, and the effects of a surfactant. The diluent of the invention is particularly useful as a carrier for blood samples in instruments which automatically provide medical di agnostic determinations of blood samples. The diluent herein includes conventional sodium and potassium chlor ides as electrolytes, pH buffers, such as monobasic and dibasic phosphate, and ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid to control and chelate the divalent cations. The balanced preservative surfactant combination may include, for exam ple, 2 phenoxyethanol with certain ethylene oxide polypropylene glycol condensation products.
