# Device for performing a heat sensitive recording, heat sensitive recording sheet, and a method for performing a heat sensitive recording.

## Abstract
A heat sensitive recording sheet is proposed which has a heat sensitive recording layer 1b laminated on the sur face of a support body 1a and containing a diazosulfonate a coupling agent and a thermoplastic resin having a glass transition point of 70 150 C or a photocuring resin. A method for fixing a heat sensitive recording is disclosed in which light of 400 550 nm in wavelenght is irradiated on said heat sensitive recording layer 1b for opticaily activat ing it, a thermal head is used for heat sensitive recording, and light of 300 450 nm in wavelength is irradiated on the recording layer 1b for photofixing the recorded informa tion. A divice for effecting such heat sensitive recording is also proposed.
