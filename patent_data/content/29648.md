# Ball game apparatus.

## Abstract
A game in which each opposing player utilizes a racquet, a paddle 16 , or a hand to propel a ball 19 on to a game board 15 having three playing surfaces 40,42,44 . These playing surfaces 40,42,44 are related to one another at angles which are within a specified range. The playing surface 40 is vertically disposed on a first planar member 30 . A second planar member 32 is angularly disposed relative to the first planar member 30 and has its playing surface 42 upwardly and outwardly disposed with respect to the vertical playing surface 40 . A third planar member 34 is angularly disposed relative to the first planar member 30 and has its playing surface 44 downwardly and outwardly disposed with respect to the vertical playing surface 40 . The second 32 and third 34 planar members can be pivoted relative to the first planar member 30 to enable the angles between the respective playing surfaces 40,42,44 to be varied within the specified range. The rules of the game require that the ball 19 comes into contact with the surfaces 40,42,44 in a specified order both while serving and during play. The game board 15 may be incorporated into furniture, may be wall mounted, or may be on a free standing base.
