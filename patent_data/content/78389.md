# Bus contention resolution in data processing apparatus having multiple independant users.

## Abstract
A multiple user shared bus contention resolution facil ity permits processing elements PE s to communicate with other PE s entirely under the control of each PE without a separate bus controller. Each PE has means for broadcast ing its priority code on a contention portion of the bus and for sampling the bus after a delay in which it has received the codes from other PE s. Each PE holds its priority code on the bus for a further delay during which other PE s can sample the priority code. The PE s resolve contention for access to the information portion of the bus in a multi stage contention sequence. System usage, made possible by peer to peer distribution of bus access control, includes dynamic driven priority schemes, a variety of operating modes and hence flexible multiplexing of message traffic.
