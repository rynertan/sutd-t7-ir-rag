## Description
Numerous manual safety arrangements have been proposed for semi automatic pistols which function to reduce the possibility that the gun will be discharged during carrying and handling except when the trigger is intentionally pulled. An example of a manually operated safety arrangement is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,633,303. This reference discloses a structure having a pivotal safety shaft which is operated by a safety lever disposed on one side of a firearm. The safety lever is movable between a release position where the hammer of the firearm may strike the firing pin and a lock position where the shaft prevents the hammer striking the firing pin. With the shaft in the lock position, the safety arrangement also prevents the trigger rotating the hammer back and prevents the sear engaging the hammer. The safety arrangement is not an ambidextrous mechanism. Ambidextrous safety mechanisms have also been proposed but none has provided the protection of the scope of the present invention. A semi automatic pistol in accordance with the present invention comprises a trigger, a trigger bar, a hammer, a firing pin having both a blocking surface and a lateral projection, a rotatable sear, a slide, a rotatable firing pin blocking piece normally blocking the firing pin through engagement with such blocking surface except when acted on by the trigger bar. All of these components of the semi automatic pistol are also disclosed in co pending European Patent Application EP A 0186703. However, the semi automatic pistol in accordance with the present invention further comprises a manual safety lever arrangement differing from that of US A 3,633,303 in that, in its active position, it additionnally 1 blocks forward movement of the firing pin through engagement with a firing pin lateral projection and 2 holds the trigger bar down to prevent movement of the bar from rotating the rotatable firing pin blocking piece to unblock the firing pin, and in that it is operable from either side of the gun. Said manual safety lever arrangement includes slide openings in such slide adjacent the firing pin a safety lever body portion rotatably mounted in the slide bearing openings straddling the firing pin, said body portion including a right hand body section projecting from the right hand of the slide and a left hand body section projecting from the left hand side of the slide said body portion being rotatable to a first inactive position and to a second active position first hammer means on one of the body sections for permitting the hammer to engage the firing pin in the first position second hammer means on one of the body sections for preventing the hammer from engaging the firing pin when the lever is in the second position firing pin blocking means on one of the sections for blocking the firing pin in the second position sear engaging means on one of the body sections for rotating the sear so it cannot engage the hammer in said second safety lever position and trigger bar engaging means for engaging the trigger bar to prevent the bar, in its forward movement, from rotating the firing pin blocking means to unblock the firing pin. It is also a feature that the safety is operable from either side of the gun and is readily disassembled.

In FIG. 1, semi automatic pistol 10 includes barrel 11, frame 12, grip 13, trigger guard 14, trigger 16, hammer 17, manual safety lever 18, magazine 19, magazine release lever 22 and front and rear sights 23 and 24, respectively. Also shown is slide 26 and slide lock lever 27. Turning to FIGS. 2 and 3, barrel 11 carries a cartridge 28 including primer 29, slide 26 with a firing pin housing cavity 32 and a firing pin 33 positioned therein. Firing pin 33 is normally urged to the rear by firing pin spring 34 which rearward movement of the firing pin 33 is limited by a firing pin surface 33a of firing pin head portion 37 see FIG. 28 . Firing pin head portion 37 has formed thereon an angled stop surface 41 which engages projection finger 42 of pivotable firing pin blocking piece 43 to block firing pin 33. Also shown are trigger bar 38 and pivotable sear 39. Firing pin blocking piece 43 includes center body 44 carrying upstanding blocking finger 42 depending ejector engageable leg 46 and spaced apart depending support piece 47 which carries blocking piece stud 48. Nested within the opening between the ejector leg 46 and support piece 47 of blocking piece 43 is pivotable sear 39. Sear 39 includes spaced apart frame members 51, 52, sear notch 53 and sear manual latch projection 50. Trigger 16 includes two 2 trigger pivot cams 57, 58. One cam 57 is on one side of trigger 16 and the other pivot cam with extension arm 58 is on the other side. Cam 58 includes opening 59 which carries trigger bar pivot stud 60 attached to or forming a part of trigger bar 38. Trigger 16 with its attached cams 57, 58 rotates in configured frame opening 61 and is restrained in part by latch axle 40 of latch 27. Trigger bar 38 has upper configured cam surface 62 which rides against a lower interior surface 25 of slide 26 FIG. 2 . Interior slide surface 25 includes a straight portion 25a and a recessed portion 25b. Trigger bar 38 also includes trigger bar opening 63 which opening 63 includes a larger upper portion 63a and a smaller lower portion 63b. Trigger bar 38 is urged counterclockwise FIG. 2 about pivot stud 60 by trigger bar plunger 64 urged by plunger spring 65. The travel and position of the trigger bar 38 during operation and handling of the pistol is determined by the position of trigger 16 and the position of reciprocal slide 26. The varying positions of these parts during pistol operation will be further described with reference to subsequent figures. Hammer 17 is pivotable about hammer pivot 66. Hammer 17 includes side projection notch 67, sear notch 68 and hammer strut opening 71. Hammer strut 72 together with hammer strut spring 73 urge hammer 17 to its down position as shown in FIG. 2. Cartridge ejector 74 includes cartridge engaging lip 76 and blocking piece engageable wing 77. Ejector 74 is pivotable about ejector pivot pin 78. Also shown in FIG. 3 is slide lock lever 27 which includes slide lock axle 40, slide body portion 82 and catch 83. In addition sear return spring 87 blocking piece return spring 88 and manual safety sections 89 and 91 are shown. Trigger bar side extension 92 for engaging hammer projection 67 in double action operation is also shown. Turning now to FIGS. 4 and 5, the hammer 17 is shown down in its rest position with both firing pin blocking piece 43 and sear 39 rotated fully counterclockwise under urging of, and limited by, their return springs 87 and 88 see FIG. 3 . In this state, firing pin blocking piece 43 is in its blocking position with firing pin 33 constrained from being driven forward any substantial distance as its surface 41 will engage blocking piece projection finger 42 to block pin 33 from striking the primer 29 of cartridge 28. Turning now to FIGS. 5 13, the following positions of the firing mechanism are shown In the sequence of operations described above, the firing pin blocking piece 43 is in its blocking position at all times except just before firing and during firing. For example, immediately after firing with trigger 16 back, pistol slide 26 moves the trigger bar 38 down as it automatically moves back placing firing pin blocking piece stud 48 in the upper portion 63a of opening 63 FIG. 10 . In this trigger bar position, the firing pin blocking piece 43 moves to its normal blocking position. As the slide 26 in its normal cycle again goes forward, the trigger bar 38 will not rotate the blocking piece 43 to unblock the firing pin 33 even if the trigger 16 has held back. With the trigger 16 held back, stud 48 will remain in opening 63a as the slide goes forward. Thus, where the trigger is held back during cycling of the slide, firing pin blocking piece 43 will remain in its blocking position. To fire the pistol from this trigger back position, the user must first move trigger 16 forward to allow the trigger bar 38 to move under detent spring pressure up against and into recess 25a of closed slide 26. The trigger bar 38 being now positioned with the stud 48 in the lower portion 63b of the opening 63 is ready to be fired by a subsequent trigger pull. Turning finally to FIG. 17, hammer 17 is shown manually pulled back against frame stop surface 95. In this position, the firing pin blocking piece 43 remains in its blocking position with finger projection 42 in front of surface 41 of pin 33. The trigger bar 38, not being connected to hammer 17 and the hammer 17 and bar 38 being configured so as not to engage one another in this hammer position, trigger bar 38 remains stationary. Since only trigger bar movement can lead to the unblocking of firing pin, firing pin 33 remains blocked. If hammer 17 is released in this fully back position, hammer 17 will move forward under the force of strut 72 until the hammer notch 68 engages the sear notch 53. Upon expenditure of all rounds in magazine 19, a new magazine is loaded and the initial firing can, as described above, be first by single or double action. Thereafter sequential semi automatic firing may proceed from the reset position. The manual safety arrangement and alternative safety mechanism embodiments are shown in FIGS. 18 through 36. With particular reference to FIGS. 18 20, pistol 10 includes frame 12, slide 26, barrel 11, trigger 16, trigger guard 14, handle grip 13 and slide 26 and safety mechanism 18. Turning in particular to FIGS. 20, 28 and 33, it is seen that manual safety lever mechanism 18 includes right and left body sections 89, 91 mounted for rotation in round slide openings 89a and 91a, respectively. Sections 89, 91 straddle firing pin 33 and are joined together by connecting pin 95 so that when one section is rotated in its slide opening the other section also rotates. This arrangement permits ambidextrous operation of the safety lever mechanism 18 by operation of right and left thumbpieces 91b and 89b. Left section 91 is held in position in slide opening 91a by retaining pin 97 mounted in slide 26 which pin 97 has a longitudinal projection key 98 projecting down into slot 99 FIGS. 20, 28 . Connecting pin 95 is secured to the left hand section 91 by welding or brazing passes through firing pin opening 33a and has its other end connected to the right safety section 89. Turning to FIGS. 21 22, 28 and 33, it is seen that the manual safety lever 18 in the off position does not block the firing pin 33 since firing pin side projection 35 is free to pass through projection opening 101 of left section 91. Left section 91 includes a flat hammer bearing surface 102 against which hammer 17 rests in its down position FIGS. 21, 28 . In the hammer down position, hammer 17 is urged toward the rear slide surface 26a FIG. 33 with sufficient force to move firing pin 33 forward somewhat overcoming the resistance of firing pin spring 34. In its off mode the safety lever mechanism 18 performs none of its safety functions however, the firing pin blocking finger 42 of firing pin blocking piece 43 automatically blocks firing pin 33 from moving fully forward in the hammer down position as described Turning to FIGS 23, 24, 25, 26 and 28, the manual safety mechanism 18 is seen in its second position its on and operative position . In this mode the following conditions are met With attention to FIGS. 27 and 28, a spring loaded detent 106 is positioned in left section 91 for entry into slide detent recess 107 in the safety s first off position and in slide detent recess 108 in the safety s second on position. FIG. 30 depicts the left hand section 91 in section showing connector pin 95, slot 102, thumbpiece 91b and firing pin lateral projection slot 101. FIG. 29 shows an alternative embodiment of the safety mechanism 18 in which the sections 89, 91 are connected with a square wire key 109. Key 109 is snapped into left section 91 and secured to right section 89. FIG. 31 shows an alternative embodiment of left section 91 including thumbpiece 91b, key 109 and thumbpiece lug 104. FIG. 32 shows a section of the first embodiment of the safety see also FIG. 18 including connecting pin 95, firing pin 33, safety lever sections 89, 91 and thumbpieces 89b, 91b, slot 102 and left thumbpiece lug 104. Turning finally to FIGS. 33 36, a readily disassembly arrangement for holding right section 89 in slide opening 89a is shown. A right section detent recess 111 in slide 26 carries detent 112 urged by its spring 113 into right section first depression 114. Detent 112 is held in place by removable spring piece 116 positioned in slide slot 117. Spring piece 116 when assembled into slide slot 117 has its rearward end 117a inserted into right section second depression 118. After spring piece end 117a is inserted into second depression 118, spring piece 116 is flexed so that its protrusion 117b can be engaged in slide slot recess 119.
