# Hemostatic clip applicator.

## Abstract
A hemostatic clip applicator 2 , useful in the rapid and automatic application of hemostatic clips 37 , for the strangulation of tubular members is disclosed. The applicator consists of a main body 20 , a clip magazine 102 externally attached to the main body, clip deforming jaws 32, 34 attached to one end of the main body, clip feed means 18 located within the clip magazine, and actuating means 5, 7 attached to the feed means and deforming jaws. In operation, one of many hemostatic clips stored in the clip magazine is fed into the deforming jaws by the interaction of the actuating means and the feed means. When the clip is properly located about a tubular member, further actuation of the actuating means results in the deformation of the clip about the tubular member. Upon further activation of the actuating means, the sequential process of feeding a clip from the magazine and deforming the clip about other tubular members may be rapidly repeated until the supply of clips in the magazine is depleted.
