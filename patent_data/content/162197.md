# DISK PLOW

## Abstract
A plurality of plowing blade bodies are attached to a gang shaft which in turn is disposed at an angle with respect to the direction of travel, and are spaced apart from each other by a suitable distance in the axial direction of the gang bolt. Each plowing blade body comprises a plurality of segment like blades and a plurality of cutaway or notched blade por tions equiangularly spaced apart from each other. Therefore the top view of each plowing blade body looks like a flower. Furthermore, each plowing blade body is in the form of a saucer. The plowing blade bodies are attached to the gang bolt such that the cutaway or notched blade portions of the adjacent plowing blade bodies are out of phase with respect to each other.
