## Description
STERILIZABLE PACKAGES AND PROCESSES This invention relates to plastic packages and containers that can be heat sealed and sterilized and to the use of certain films in the production of sucd articles. There is a need for packages and containers that have aderuate physical properties and yet can be closed by heat sealing and withstand sterilization by all of the conventional methods including ethylene oxide, steam and gamma radiation. It can also be advantageous to form such packages and containers fran thermoplastic resin materials that are in the form of films that can be made on processing equipment that is set up to form easily processed conventional low density polyethylene resins. The articles of this invention are heat sealable and sterilizable packages and containers that are made from selected triblend resin compositions a blend of a first member selected from polypropylene resins, a second member selected from ethylene propylene elastomers and a third member selected from ethylene resins. The resins may be homopolymers or copolymers as hereafter discussed.The proportions are selected to give a balance of physical properties and good heat stability. These compositions can be formed into shapes for making packaging, e.g., films of up to about 10 mils thickness, sheets of about 10 to 100 mils in thickness. The package material can be formed using equipment commonly used to form polyolefin film of conventional polyethylene types. Preparation of film is performed at temperatures higher than those used in the conventional polyethylene types. Thermoforming is accomplished in a similar manner. Packages and containers are fabricated from the films or powders or pellet form of the resin composition. One construction has a composite article which employs the resin composition as an inner wrap for the sterilizable contents of the package other constructions utilize the compositions as the principal material. With regard to the accompanying drawings, Figure 1 is an illustration of a sterilizable package having a heat sealed claazre which is fonEd according to this invention. Figure II is an illustration of a sterilizable thermoformed package according to this invention. The packages and containers of this invention and the fabrication, heat sealing and sterilization thereof are achieved by making use of a selected triblend resin composition. The components of the triblend thermoplastic resin film are a first member selected from polypropylene resin, a second member selected from ethylene propylene elastomers and a third member selected from polyethylene resins. The The f itter is preferably a thermoplastic crystalline usually isotactic polypropylene resin that has a chemical composition of essentially monomeric propylene units or propylene units together with a relatively small proportion of co monomer such as ethylene or butene.The copolymers are known as reactor copolymers, random or block. These materials are stereoregular configurations with a melt flow range preferably 0.5 to 20, particularly about 7.5. Their densities are preferably 0.S to 0.91 g cc and and they may have crystalline melting points in the region of 1200 150 C. These materials are an article of commerce and are available as powders, pellets and the like. The second member is an ethylene propylene elastomer which is either a copolymer of ethylene and propylene or a terpolymer of ethylene and propylene with a small proportion of tersonomer such as ethylidene norborene or 1,4 hexadiene 6r dicyclopentadiene. It preferably has a Mooney viscosity in the range of 15 to 70 at 260 F. ML 1 8 and like polypropylene is an article of commerce. The third member is a polyethylene resin. Its chemical composition may be a homopolymer of ethylene or a copolymer of ethylene and a comonomer of the acetate or acrylate family. The ethylene content is preferably in the range of 70 to 100 by total weight of resin. The co monomer is present in amounts preferably up to 30 mole . The polyethylene resins may be the traditional high pressure variety polymer, having a density in the range of about .91 to .94 g cc and a melt flow index of about 0.2 to 20. It may also be a linear low pressure variety having a density in the range of about .92 to .94 and a melt flow index of about 0.2 to 20. It may also be a high density variety having a density in the range of about .94 to .965 and a melt flow index in the range of .05 to 20. The crystalline melting points for these resins are preferably from 800 to 1200 C. All of these resins are articles of commerce. The proportions of the members are by weight at least 20 by weight of the first member, 10 to 60 by weight of the second member and 10 to 60 by weight of the third member. Especially preferred compositions have proportions in the range of about 30 to 70 weight for the first member, 20 to 50 weight for the second member, and 10 to 50 weight for the third member. The resin composition is prepared by blending the members together under high shear to form a molten mixture which is then cooled to form a powder or pellet. In morphological terms, the blend has the first member as a continuous phase with the second member providing compatibility to the third member which allows the blend to have desirable physical properties and good processability for forming packages and articles. This morphological structure also contributes to the steam sterilizability and gamma radiation resistance of the material. At lesser proportions of polypropylene, gamma resistance is retained but steam sterilizabilituy and high temperature dimensional stability are sacrificed. The triblend resin can then be converted into films for preparation of package components. It is readily formed into films by using conventional low pressure polyethylene film blowing equipment. This process is one where triblend resin compositions are melted in an ex truder and then blown into a bubble to form a film which is cooled, slit and rolled onto a spool. It is remarkable that with such large proportions of polypropylene present, the film can be made in this manner. It is noteworthy that the resin composition, during melting and shaping exhibits a trait known as melt strength . By this, both film and sheet can readily be produced in thicknesses ranging from about 0.25 mils to about 35 mils. Moreover, this property lends itself to other plastic shaping techniques to form packages and containers, such as blow moldinq, injection moldinq, casting and thermoforming. The films are characterized by having a combination of physical properties that satisfies a balance of enA use objectives These are tensile strength, elongation at break, stiffness. tear strength and puncture impact strength. In addition, the films are readily heat able and can be subjected to sterilization by heat, ethy lene oxide or gamma cobalt radiation. In packaging, the film can itself be used as the wrap to enclose an article, it can also be one of several wrappings as is usual in sterilized medical packages. The film can be laminated to other bases to yield a composite packaging material. In terms of structure, the container or package can have at least one major element made from the triblend resin compositions. In blow molded injection molded bottles or pouches, the entire article can be formed from the resin material because it is adapted to both blow molding and injection moldinq. The resin compositions are especially useful for the elements of the container that are adjacent to the contents in these cases the heat sealability and sterilizability of the composition is used to maximum advantage. Baqs can be made by slitting the film and then heat sealing the edges to form pouches. These are filled, closed by heat sealing and sterilized by steam or radiation. This filled package can then be inserted into an outer container such as cardboard for shipping. Where ethylene oxide is the sterilization media, the container or package will need a paper lid or section that is permeable to the ethylene oxide. Because film is a basic packaging material, processability of the resin compositions into film is a useful advantage of this invention. Moreover, the film can be heat sealed to other materials to make package windows or package walls. Vicat softening points for the resin composition can be controlled by the proportion of ingredients. These can be varied from about 620C to about 1300C by increasing the proportion of the first member. The ability to achieve low softening points indicates ease of controlling heat sealability for fabrication of articles according to this invention. The range of practical temperatures for heat sealibility is of importance because the films and sheets of this invention can achieve good seal strengths over a wide range of temperatures to accomodate equipment variations.The polypropylene first member links good mechanical properties to the material while the ethylene propylene rubber second member and polyethylene third member give the low temperature sealing capability. As a whole, the material resists thinning during heat sealing. To illustrate the invention, film samples are prepared by blending components as described above and then processing molten resin compositions on film blowing equipment.The equipment comprises an extruder, a die, a film blowing unit, and a nip roller. The triblend resin composition has 50 by weight of the first member, 30 by weiqht of the second member and 20 by weight of the third member.In this example, the first member is polypropylene homopolymer of 0.904 g cc density the second member is an ethylene propylene elastomer having a viscosity of ML 1 8 at 250 OF of 45 and the third member is a low density polyethylene resin of 0.902 g cc density.

A particular application of the invention is directed towards packaging where the advantageous heat sealing and sterilizability of the films can be seen to advantage.Figure 1 illustrates an arrangement for such packaging.In Figure 1, a cross sectional illustration of a package construction is given. There is a package 1 which is the container 2 and its contents 6 . The container illustrated is a pouch having a first edge 3 and a second edge 4 formed by heat sealing together the film of the container. In the filled closed container, the remainder of the edges would be sealed. Preferably, at least one edge is an opening which after filling is itself heat sealed. In a preferred construction, there is also an overwrap 5 . This is desirably an outer covering for the inner package. The contents can have a liquid or solid portion 6 and or a vapor portion 7 . Especially, the contents may be materials which require sterilization for use in medical applications. The sterilization in this example can be accomplished by heat or radiation. Where radiation is used, the dosage may be up to 5.0 megarads in strength. Radiation is more common for sterilization of solids, e.g., syringes, sutures and gauze. For liquids, steam sterilization is preferred so that adverse chemical side reactions of the contents can be avoided. Packages formed from sheets are illustrated in Figure 2. In this illustration, the package 200 is made from a tub 201 and a lid 220 . The tub is prepared by deep draw thermoforming of a sheet of the resin material described in this invention. It has a continuous crosssection. There are edge lips 202 , 203 , which join sidewalls 204 and 205 that connect to a bottom 206 .The draw ratio is relatively high, i.e., the ratio of depth to width is high. The contents are a solid and shown as 210 . Two features of the invention apply to constructions illustrated in Figure 2. The container is sterilizable and the wall thickness is relatively uniform so that thin sections in wails or corners are avoided. The lid may be opaque paper that is heat sealed to the tub. The contents are sterilized by gamma radiation.It may also be advantageous to overwrap the package as was explained in reference to Figure 1. The packages and containers of this invention can also be used for hot fill materials1. In this procedure, the fill material is at a temperature sufficient to sterilize or maintain the film in a wholesome condition. It is packaged while hot and then stored. Because of the thermal stability of the containers made from the resin compositions of this invention, the container will retain its physical dimensions while the heated contents cool.Foodstuffs are principal examples, especially brine packed foods. A series of film samples are prepared to illustrate the application of the invention to structures such as shown in Figures 1 and 2. Packaging for medical applications presents a very demanding set of objectives with minimum tradeoffs available between contrasting objectives. The following examples also illustrate other methods for preparing containers according to this invention and the several preferred species for practice of the invention. Resin formulations are prepared by blending together the first member, the second member and the third member in a Banbury mixer. After becoming molten, the mixture is shaped into pellets. The pellets are re melted and can be extruded into a film by casting or blowing. Sheet can be formed by calendering. The film is then formed into a pouch by heat sealing edge portions, filling and heat sealing the opening. It is covered with an overwrap and then it is sterilized at about 115 to 1250C with steam for about 25 45 minutes. Table II illustrates the change in haze from autoclaving when a film sample of approximately 7 mils is sterilized. The ratio of resin components are 50 weight first member, 30 weight second member, 20 weight third member. The films are generally autoclave stable.

The polyethylene types are low density polyethylene resin X l , ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer 5 VA X 2 ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer 18 VA X 3 ethylene methyl acrylate copolymer 20 by wt., MA X 4 . The second member is an ethylene propylen elastomer. Type 1 has an ML 1 8 of 50 Type 2 has an ML l 8 of 22. The additives are for processing, stability and haze control. In addition, these affect stiffness. For optimum resistance to haze increase, it is preferred to use low molecular weight polyethylene wax as an additive. Antioxidants also tend to reduce haze increase. In the forming of the film by casting, it is also desirable to minimize melt temperature for optimizing haze. A film sample is prepared from 45 pts first member polypropylene resin reactor copolymer 15 pts second member ethylene propylene elastomer 40 pts third member polyethylene resin, and 0.3 pts hydrolysis control agent 0.2 pts slip agent. The above composition is preferred for film that is made into sterilizable bags for solutions as described TABLE III 1 2 A B C D E F G H I J K L 3 Pirat Member 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 40 4 Third Member 5 X 1 25 5 X 2 25 30 7 X 3 25 20 30 30 30 8 X 4 25 9 Second Member 10 Type I 35 35 35 35 35 25 25 15 25 25 11 Type II 35 60 12 Primol 355 25 25 15 5 5 5 13 Irganox D225 0.15 0.15 0.15 0.15 0.15 0.15 0.15 0.15 0.15 0.15 0.15 0.15 14 VISTANEX L 120 10 15 AC 9 PE 5 16 Secant Flex Modulus, 17 psi 56,400 56,300 53,800 54,700 26,100 37,000 31,000 38,000 36,900 48,800 43,000 18 Greasy Greasy Greasy Sl.Greasy 19 Gauge, mils 8.2 8.2 8.0 7.8 7.3 7.6 8.3 8.6 8.4 8.7 6.6 8.7 20 Haze , 21 Before Autoclave 30 35 34 28 28 49 56 38 34.5 43.8 30 40 22 Aftar 56 51 42 41 54 63 61 47 44 47 32 46.6 23 26 16 8 13 26 14 5 9 9.5 3.2 2 6.6 24 Colorimeter Readings 25 Yellowness Before 2.5 3.86 2.28 2.34 2.80 3.12 2.97 2.36 2.28 2.37 1.98 2.67 26 Index Aftar 5.5 4.86 3.14 3.02 3.35 5.20 6.40 4.47 4.54 3.89 3.47 5.28 27 3.0 1.0 0.8 0.7 2.6 2.1 3.4 2.1 2.2 1.5 1.5 2.6 28 L Before 95.7 92.91 95.29 95.4 94.87 93.26 93.96 95.49 94.98 94.71 95.27 95.0 29 After 91.0 93.45 94.56 94.09 92.84 89.5 92.13 91.95 91.86 93.34 93.15 93.53 30 b Before 1.28 1.96 1.15 1.22 1.51 1.44 1.48 1.22 1.15 1.15 0.99 1.39 31 After 2.79 2.52 1.64 1.57 2.80 2.41 3.18 2.18 2.20 1.64 1.72 2.66 32 1.5 0.5 0.4 0.4 1.3 1.0 1.7 1.0 1.0 0.4 0.7 1.3 above.The wax additives can be AC 9 polyethylene wax orAC 316 oxidized polyethylene wax. The hydrolysis control agent can be Ethyl Antioxidant 330, see U.S.P. 4,140,162.The slip agent can be Armoslip 0 slip agent. Articles can also be fabricated by thermoforming the triblend resin compositions into trays, tubs and the like. These articles may be subjected to sterilization by radiation at dosages of 2.5 and 5.0 megarads, or alternatively by steam at 1250C for about thirty minutes.The physical properties of these sterilized articles will be about 70 of the values for the non sterilized articles.It is noted that in respect to the second member, the resistance to change in physical properties increases as the ethylene content is increased. Especially, in that polypropylene is known to show severe post irradiation embrittlement, it is surprising that an article with the significant levels of polypropylene resin disclosed herein has retained significant physical properties so that the article is still useful as a package or container. The following examples of packages made by thermoforming exemplify the versatility of sterilizability, good processing and retention of physical properties which are features of this invention. Sheets are made from resin compositions having A 65 by weight of the first member, 21 by weight of the second member and 14 by weight of the third member and B 61 by weight of the first member, 25 by weight of the second member and 14 by weight of the third member.Antioxidants and stabilizers are included. The resin mixture is cast into sheets and this is thermoformed into rectangular tubs of about 4 x 4 x 11 4 depth. The wall thickness is in the range of 20 25 mils. The samples are subjected to steam autoclaving of 30 minutes at 2500 F. Other samples are sterilized with gamma radiation at 2.5 and 5.0 megarads. Physical properties as measured by accelerated aging test, 1200F in hot air, illustrate the physical properties of the samples TABLE IV SAMPLE A AUTOCLAVE STERILIZATION AGED, WEEKS 0 2 4 8Tensile Strength psi commat Yield 3760 2980 3085 3245 commat Break 3110 2450 2580 2635Elongation e Yield 19 16 16 15 commat Break 505 420 760 405Puncture Impact in lbs mil 0.8 1.6 1.5 2.0 b Gardner Color 7.4 7.5 7.1 9.6 TABLE V SAMPLE B AUTOCLAVE STERILIZATION AGED, WEEKS 0 2 4 8Tensile Strength psi commat Yield 3420 3155 3215 3220 e Break 3295 2750 2995 2780Elongation e Yield 12 19 19 18 commat Break 960 1115 1025 1000Puncture Impact in Ibs mil 1.0 1.5 1.5 1.6 b Gardner Color 10.0 11.7 9.3 13.1 TABLE VI IRRADIATION SAMPLE A 2.5 M Rads AGED, WEEKS 0 2 4 8Tensile Strength psi commat Yield 2890 2660 2880 2830 commat Break 3360 2990 3675 3505Elongation, commat Yield 13 12 13 15 commat Break 1215 1210 1635 1450Puncture Impact, in lbs mil 2.5 2.2 1.7 2.3 b Gardner Color 11.2 12.7 13.1 14.6 SAMPLE A 5 M Rads AGED, WEEKS 0 2 4 8Tensile Strength psi commat Yield 2930 2960 2775 3065 commat Break 3790 2670 3090 2960Elongation, commat Yield 10 14 15 15 commat Break 1590 1280 1300 1180Puncture Impact in lbs mil 1.4 2.5 1.6 2.0 b Gardner Color 12.4 13.5 14.4 16.4 TABLE VII IRRADIATION SAMPLE B 2.5 M Rads AGED, WEEKS 0 2 4 8Tensile Strength psi commat Yield 3090 2910 3035 3000 commat Break 3790 3815 3700 3615Elongation, commat Yield 12 15 16 15 commat Break 1430 1315 1565 1445Puncture Impact in lbsfmil 1.3 1.7 1.7 1.7 b Gardner Color 13.7 14.7 18.9 16.1 SAMPLE B 5 M Rads AGED, WEEKS 0 2 4 8Tensile Strength psi commat Yield 3940 2990 2940 2330 commat Break 2470 2315 2310 2445Elongation, commat Yield 12 14 15 16 commat Break 1520 780 780 1080Puncture Impact in lbs mil 1.0 1.5 1.4 1.5 b Gardner Color 12.8 13.2 13.4 17.1 Samples on 6 month shelf life tests exhibit the same physical property relationships. From the foregoing it can be seen that this invention provides substantially improved film components that have combinations of stiffness, heat sealability and resistance to puncture and haze development that are needed for sterilizable medicinal packaging. Also, the advantages of such packaging are related to the interaction of the resin components as well as the preferred additives discussed above. While the invention has been described to illustrate preferred embodiments, it is equally within the scope of this invention to practice embodiments common to the art such as interchanging contents of the packages where instruments are substituted for medical solutions, or where film is prepared in multi ply or laminate form rather than single ply form. The above physical properties were measured in accordance with the following industrial standards.
