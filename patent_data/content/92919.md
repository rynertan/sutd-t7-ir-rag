# DEVICE FOR ISOLATING ONE CIRCUIT IN A DOUBLE HYDRAULIC CIRCUIT FOR SHIP STEERING SYSTEMS

## Abstract
Apparatus for automatically or remotely dividing a two pump unit hydraulic steering system, upon detection of dangerous loss of fluid, into two independent steering systems in order to maintain steering capacity utilises an isolation valve 10 for blocking interconnecting piping 11, 12 in conjunction with by pass valves 15, 16 for relieving resistance by one ram group 24 to motion of another 25 . The valves 15, 16 and the pump units 13, 14 are regulated automatically or remotely by a control unit 21 in response to detection of fluid loss to achieve steering by the ram group on the loss free side.
