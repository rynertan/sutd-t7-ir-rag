## Description
This invention relates to a novel process for the recovery of a crystalline form of alpha amylase produced by Enzymes behave as biocatalysts, regulating many of the chemical reactions that naturally occur in living organisms. When isolated, enzymes also have many industrial, as well as medical uses. For instance, enzymes are used in the tanning, food and detergent industries. Much research has been conducted on methods to precipitate enzymes. For instance, Chiang, Alter, and Sternberg, Purification and Characterization of a Thermostable Alpha Amylase from Dixon et al, Enzymes , Academic Press, 3rd edition, pages 1 40, 1979 discuss ammonium sulfate crystallization of enzymes and a variation of this method involving extracting a small amount of the precipitated enzyme with cold, dilute ammonium sulfate solution. Yokoyama et al, Production and Crystallization of Acid Carboxypeptidase of Uwajima et al, Production, Purification and Crystallization of Creatinine Deiminase of Uwajima et al, Production, Purification and Crystallization of III Alpha Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase of McCary in U.S. Patent No. 3,642,582 discloses a process to obtain alpha amylase involving first removing polyvalent anions from alpha amylase preparations, and then contacting the preparation with fibrous alumina. The present invention provides for a method for the recovery of an enzyme from a solution thereof obtained from an enzyme producing micro organism, said method comprising The present invention refers to the recovery of alpha amylase in a crystal form. The invention is a simplification over known methods to obtain enzyme crystals in that the enzyme containing solution prior to the induction of crystallization is not required to be pure, i.e. free of essentially all soluble solids. Also, in the prior art, salts or organic solvents are introduced to induce crystallization of enzymes, which may be done but is unnecessary in the present invention. When salts and or organic solvents are employed in the prior art methods to induce an enzyme complex to precipitate, often the precipitate is not used as the end product but only as a step in an overall process that results in a liquid end product. Thus, the supersaturation techniques of the present invention eliminate many problems associated with the typical industrial enzyme containing liquid products, such as product stability, microbial contamination, low potency, large volume, and high transportation costs. The object of the present invention is a method for the recovery of alpha amylase secreted during the controlled fermentation of a bacterium of the species The drawing is a graphic depiction of an embodiment of the invention where the enzyme is alpha amylase TAKA THERM . In the graph, the Brix value and percent crystallization are compared to the fold concentration. The present invention begins with an alpha amylase containing solution. The solution containing the enzyme obtained from The enzyme is a fermentation product. Known methods such as centrifugation may be used to remove the biomass, providing a solution that is a cell free filtrate containing the enzyme. Thus, in the preferred method, the enzyme containing solution is a cell free filtrate obtained from the controlled fermentation of an enzyme secreting bacteria. Next, the process of the present invention contemplates supersaturation techniques in concentrating the enzyme containing solution. Optionally, the enzyme containing solution may be first diluted with water, and the dilution followed by supersaturation techniques in concentrating the solution. A supersaturated solution is one which has a greater amount of solute than is normally possible for the saturated solution at that temperature, and such supersaturated solutions are unstable. A sudden shock, dust particles, or a scratch on the inner surface of the solution s container can act as a center on which crystallization may begin. Thus, care must be taken to maintain the supersaturated condition until it is desired to have crystallization begin. See, Pierce, Sawyer, and Haenisch, Quantitative Analysis , 4th Edition, page 349 Jan. 1961 . Desirably, supersaturation is achieved by ultrafiltration UF , followed by evaporation. UF is conducted at 5 C to 15 C until the volume is about 10 to 50 of the volume of the original enzyme containing solution. It is desirable to conduct the evaporation under a vacuum at a temperature between 25 C and 39 C until the concentrate is supersaturated. In the preferred method, the evaporation under a vacuum is conducted at 32 C, at a pressure differential of approximately 500 to 760 mm 20 to 30 inches of mercury. The evaporation under vacuum should be continued until the volume of the concentrate is approximately 10 to 20 of its volume after ultrafiltration. The concentration creates a supersaturated state in the solution, in which the Brix value reading should be approximately 8 to 60 , preferably between about 30 and 40 , at 22 c. The Brix value indicates the amount of soluble solids in solution in relation to sucrose as a standard. In a preferred embodiment, concentration is begun by UF to about 25 50 of the volume of the original enzyme containing solution, and then continued by evaporation. The pH must be at a level near the isoelectric point of the enzyme. The pH should be in a range from about 2.5 pH units below the isoelectric point up to about 2.5 pH units above the isoelectric point. Preferably, the pH is in a range 1.5 units from the isoelectric point. In the preferred embodiments, in which the enzyme is obtained from the fermentation of enzyme secreting bacteria, the pH adjustment during the fermentation process may have been sufficient. Accordingly, prior to concentrating to supersaturation, the pH of the original enzyme containing solution may already be in the desired range near the isoelectric point of the enzyme. Thus, further pH adjustment may be unnecessary. On the other hand, if the pH is not already in the desired range near the isoelectric point of the enzyme, then sometime during or after concentration, the pH must be adjusted to a point within the desired range. Also, even though the pH may already be in the desired range, it may be adjusted either nearer or even farther from the isoelectric point, as long as it is at a point within the desired range. The pH should be between 6.8 and 8.1,. The isoelectric point of alpha amylase is approximately 7.2. Typically, ammonia or KOH is used for pH adjustment. After concentration, crystallization is induced. Sometimes the movement during UF and evaporation is enough to cause crystallization to begin spontaneously when concentrating is terminated. Usually, however, induction of crystallization is achieved by means such as seeding, sound, stirring, or scratching the inner surface of the container. Typically, the concentrate is stirred with a propellor type agitator for a period of time sufficient to cause crystallization of the enzyme at the prevailing temperature. Stirring as used here is intended to include all means of giving movement to the solution, and includes, but is not limited to, slow stirring, agitation rapid stirring , and shaking, as well as the flowing movement of the solution during UF and or evaporation. Usually, stirring is conducted with a propellor type blade spinning at 50 to 400 RPM revolutions per minute for 24 to 120 hours at a temperature of 5 C to 60 C. Preferably, the stirring is done above room temperature. A typical temperature is 23 C 32 C. A temperature around 25 C and a time around 72 hours is most desired for alpha amylase. The crystals precipitate and may be recovered by any known liquid solid separatory technique such as centrifugation with decantation or filtration. Heat stable alpha amylase was obtained as follows A nutrient medium suitable for fermentation of alpha amylase can be prepared by adding the following ingredients to a 1,000 liter fermentor The medium was inoculated with viable cells of Concentration by ultrafiltration of the TAKA THERM alpha amylase cell free filtrate having 50,000 MWU ml activity was carried out in a Romicon HF 4 filter apparatus with a 10,000 molecular weight cut off membrane at 10 C to obtain a concentrate with a volume of 300 liters having an activity of 150,000 MWU ml. Concentration was continued by evaporation under vacuum in a flash evaporator Buffalo single stage forced circulation vacuum evaporator with the pressure differential adjusted to 500 to 760 mm 20 to 30 inches of Hg at 32 C until the volume of the concentrate was down to 50 liters with an activity of 900,000 MWU ml. This resulted in a supersaturated concentrate. The concentrate was adjusted to pH 7.6 using 20 KOH, and then stirred at 300 RPM with a propellor type agitator for 72 hours at 25 C resulting in the formation of enzyme crystals. The resulting enzyme crystals were recovered by centrifugation, and the excess liquid decanted. Enzyme yield in the crystals was 92 of the evaporate concentrate s total activity. The dry crystals from this example had an activity of 8,000,000 MWU gm of dry material and 12,000,000 MWU gm of protein. A 1000 liter TAKA THERM filtrate was obtained from a fermentation similar to that used in Example I for the production of alpha amylase crystals from the fermentation of The 20 ml volumes sampled, recited in column 2, are included because they were used as the basis in determining the percent recovery, i.e. these initial values were designated as 100 . The volumes in column 4 are the volumes remaining of the supernatant after the enzyme crystals were removed. Thus, the enzyme activity in column 5 is the MWU ml activity remaining in the supernatant after the crystals were removed, from which was calculated the percent enzyme activity recovery in the supernatant in column 6. The volumes in column 7 are the total volumes used after dissolving the enzyme crystals in H₂O, thus yielding the MWU ml of enzyme activity of the crystals in column 8. Then the percent recovery of the crystals in column 9 is calculated in the usual method with the formula described at the bottom of the Table. Also, at an average initial concentrate activity of 600,000 MWU ml, results are summarized graphically in the Figure. From this graph it can be seen that an average activity of 600,000 MWU ml with 6.7 fold ultrafiltration resulted in approximately 85 86 of the enzyme being in crystallized form. Further ultrafiltration above 6.7 fold did not increase crystal formation, but rather crystallization falls off drastically as the Brix at 22 C decreases. At 2 fold UF concentration with 600,000 MWU ml, about 52 53 of the enzyme was in crystalline form. The Brix value indicates the amount of soluble solids present in solution in relation to sucrose as a standard. Therefore, the graph illustrates that ultrafiltration removes soluble solids that interfere with crystallization. If enough of the soluble solids are not removed, then TAKA THERM cannot be evaporated to a high enough concentration for crystallization to occur. Rather, the solution will become so viscous that further evaporation cannot be conducted. The Brix values in the graph indicate the point at which enough soluble solids are removed so that evaporation may be continued far enough to obtain supersaturation for crystallization as used in the example.
