The interior of the sleeve 1 comprises a guide portion 9 of a diameter ess entially corresponding to the diameter of the rod 6 , and a widened portion 12 arranged inside of the guide portion 9 . The end portion of the rod 6 is formed with a portion 7 of reduced diameter and a portion 8 widened therefrom tow ards the end of the rod. A plurality of locking bodies in the form of spheres 21 are disposed in the annular space 23 formed between the widened portion 12 of the sleeve body 1 and the rod portion 7 of reduced diameter, and in alock ing position these spheres bear against the inner wall of the sleeve and the outer wall of the rod 6 , these spheres being kept in place by a hardened binding agent 22 filling said annular space 23 .
