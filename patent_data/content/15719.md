# Improvements in or relating to bandstop filters.

## Abstract
A filter network that exhibits a bandstop response com prises a network of basically low pass or high pass structure. The network is developed by choosing a bandstop transfer function, a fourth order elliptic is disclosed, which is converted to a low pass function. This function describes a passive low pass LC ladder network including a negative impendance ele ment. A Bruton transformation is applied to the passive LC network to give an active version including an ungrounded negative resistance network 24 in a series arm and frequen cy dependent negative resistances 36 and 38 in shunt arms without requiring inductance coils for its implementation.
