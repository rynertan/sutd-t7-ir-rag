# RADIATION IMAGE FORMING METHOD AND APPARATUS

## Abstract
In a radiation image forming system, an object is two dimensionally scanned by a linear radiation beam by moving the linear radiation beam with respect to the object in a direction intersecting the longitudinal direction of the linear radiation beam. The radiation passing through the object is recorded on a plane radiation sensitive material having a size for receiving the radiation passing through the object during two dimensional scanning of the object. The image thus recorded is detected and converted into a digital image signal.
