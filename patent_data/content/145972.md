# Coherent optical communication system with FSK heterodyne or homodyne detection and little influence by distortion of a modulated optical signal.

## Abstract
A laser 21 is frequency modulated by an electrical modulating signal of a bit rate into a modulated signal of a first and a second modulated frequency. A combination of an optical mixer 27 and an optical detector 31 carries out optical heterodyne or homodyne detection on the modulated optical signal to produce a detected signal having a first and a second frequency component. A component separator 32 is for selecting only one of the components from the detect ed signal. A detector 33 detects the selected component to produce a demodulated electrical signal representative of the modulating signal. The laser is preferably a semicon ductor laser. More preferably, the semiconductor laser is frequency modulated after the modulating signal is convert ed to a current of an mBnB code sequence. When the bit rate is below and above about 10 Mbit second, either the modulating signal or the mBnB code sequence current is preferably used in frequency modulating the semiconductor laser after caused to pass through a high pass and a low pass filter, respectively.
