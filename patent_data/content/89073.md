# Single point mooring system.

## Abstract
A single point mooring system 1 is provided with pressure relief means 17 for opening a passage between a flow line 8 for transferring liquids and a liquid collecting reservoir 16 when the liquid pressure in the flow line 8 reaches a predetermined critical value. A signal transmitter 19 is present for transmitting a signal to a signal receiver 21, 22 in response to detection by a detector 18 of the occurrence of said critical value. Furthermore flow control means 23, 24 are arranged in the flow line 8 for controlling liquid flow through the flow line 8 in response to the signal received by the signal receiver 21, 22 .
