## Abstract
One form of apparatus for treatment of elastomers and polymers has an innertube 10 of rectangular section in an out er tubular shell 11. A treatment medium, for example a liquid mixture of eutectic salts, is circulated by a pump 14 from a reservoir 13 to a manifold 19 and thence to the tube 10 to fill the tube apart from its ends. The medium issues from the ends of the tube 10 into the shell 11 from which it drains to the reservoir 13. Conveyors 30, 31 are arranged to feed an elon gate article through the tube 10. A hot, gaseous wipe is pro vided by device 40. The interior of shell 11 is filled with gas un der pressure through inlet 43. A pressurised water cooling sys tem 50 is included. A similar arrangement not under gaseous pressure is also described.
