## Description
The present invention relates to the oxidation of alkanes and other saturated hydrocarbons, alkenes, dienes, vinyl aromatic compounds and secondary alcohols through the action of oxygen and microbial cells of microorganisms, or enzyme preparations derived therefrom, which utilize C2 C6 alkanes as the major carbon and energy source. This invention also relates to oxidation of secondary alcohols via action of oxygen and microbial cells of microorganisms, or enzyme preparations derived therefrom, which utilize C2 C6 alkyl radical donating compounds such as C2 C6 linear primary alcohols andC2 C6 alkylamines. Methane is not the only hydrocarbon substrate on which microorganisms can be grown. Depending on the particular bacterial strain employed, gaseous and liquid hydrocarbons have been known to be effective as growth substrates. The genera of microorganisms known to utilize hydrocarbons other than methane as carbon and energy source broadly include, e.g., Achromobacter,Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Nocardia, Bacillus, Mycobac terium, Corynebacterium, Brevibacterium, Candida,Arthrobacter, Streptomycetes, Flavobacterium, and various filamentous fungi. It is often difficult, however, to predict, for any given combination of microorganism strain and hydrocarbon growth substrate, the precise behavior of the strain in a culture medium. U.S. Patent 3,344,037 discloses a method for enzymatically oxidizing an oxidized hydrocarbon such as an alcohol or aldehyde to an oxidation product with the same number of carbon atoms using a microorganism grown on a hydrocarbon corresponding substantially to the oxidizable hydrocarbon in number of carbon atoms. Preferably, the microorganism is chosen from the genera of Achromobacter, Pseudomonas, Nocardia, Bacillus andMycobacterium, most preferably Achromobacter grown on decane. J. W. Foster, Ant. v. Leeu., J. Microbiol. BR Ser., 28, 241 1962 provides a review of organisms grown on hydrocarbons, and more recently, l. J. Perry,Microbiol. Rev., 43, 59 1979 reviews studies of cooxidation of substrates using microorganisms grown on hydrocarbons. In cooxidations, the non growth substrates are oxidized when present as co substrates in a growth medium containing the growth substrate. Cooxidation is thus not applicable to oxidations using resting cells. A.S. Kester, PhD Diss., Univ. of Texas 1961 tested twenty three microorganisms, representing the genera Nocardia, Brevibacterium, Pseudomonas, Alkaligenes or Achromobacter, Corynebacterium, Mycobacterium,Streptomyces and Fusarium, for their capacity to grow on Cl Clg hydrocarbons, the capacities varying with the particular microorganism tested. A process is herein disclosed for oxidizing a substrate selected from alkanes, saturated alicyclic or aromatic hydrocarbons, alkenes, dienes, vinyl aromatic compounds or secondary alcohols to the corresponding oxidation product or products comprising contacting the substrate in a reaction medium under aerobic conditions with microbial cells derived from a microorganism, a genetically engineered derivative or natural mutant of the microorganism or an enzyme preparation prepared from the cells wherein the microorganism strains are selected from those strains described hereinafter , which microorganism, derivative, mutant or preparation exhibits oxygenase or dehydrogenase enzyme activity, until the corresponding product is produced in at least isolatable amounts, wherein the microorganism has been previously grown under aerobic conditions in a nutrient medium containing a compound which is a C2 C6 alkane or, if the substrate is an alcohol, the compound may additionally be a C2 C6 alkyl radical donating compound. In a preferred embodiment the substrate is aC2 C6 alkane, cyclohexane, benzene, a C2 C7 alkene, butadiene, styrene or a C3 C6 secondary alcohol for alkane grown microorganisms and a C3 C5 secondary alcohol for microorganisms grown on alkyl radical donating compounds. Most preferably, the substrate is propane, n butane, cyclohexane, benzene, ethylene, propylene, 2 propanol or 2 butanol. The C2 C6 alkane on which the microorganisms may be grown is preferably aC2 C4 alkane, e.g., ethane, propane or butane, and the C2 C6 alkyl radical donating compound is a C2 C4 compound, e.g., ethanol, propanol, butanol, ethylamine, propylamine or butylamine. In another preferred embodiment the microbial cells are resting cells, and more preferably are in the form of a resting cell suspension. In yet another preferred embodiment the enzyme preparation prepared from the cells is a cell free soluble fraction. The term microorganism is used herein in its broadest sense to include all of the microorganism strains identified below, which are generally bacterial strains. The expression genetically engineered derivatives of a microorganism is used herein in the sense recognized by those skilled in the art, and includes artificial mutants and recombinant DNA produced microorganisms. The term enzyme preparation is used to refer to any composition of matter that exhibits the desired dehydrogenase enzymatic activity. The term is used to refer, for example, to live whole cells, dried cells, cell free particulate and soluble fractions, cell extracts, and refined and concentrated preparations derived from the cells. Enzyme preparations may be either in dry or liquid form. The term also includes the immobilized form of the enzyme, e.g., the whole cells of the C2 C6 alkane or alkyl radical donating compound grown microorganisms or enzyme extracts which are immobilized or bound to an insoluble matrix by covalent chemical linkages, absorption and entrapment of the enzyme within a gel lattice having pores sufficiently large to allow the molecules of the substrate and the product to pass freely, but sufficiently small to retain the enzyme.The term enzyme preparation1 also includes enzymes retained within hollow fiber membranes, e.g., as disclosed by Rony, Biotechnology andBioengineering 1971 . The term C2 C6 alkyl radical donating compound refers to a C2 C6 alkyl compound which will donate ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl or hexyl radicals, such as ethanol, propanol, butanol, pentanol, hexanol, ethylamine, propylamine, butylamine, ethyl formate, butyl carbonate, etc. Such compounds can also be characterized as growth substrates which are capable of inducing dehydrogenase enzyme activity in the microorganism strains described below. The term resting cells refers to cells which are not maintained in a growth or nutrient medium i.e., containing a carbon and nitrogen source so that they are not being cultured where they can actively grow and multiply while the oxidation is being carried out.Typically, resting cells are prepared by harvesting the cultured cells, washing them with buffer and suspending them in the buffer so as to obtain a resting cell suspension for use in the oxidation. Thus, the nutrient growth medium is not present during the conversion.However, various materials which assist the enzymatic conversion such as, e.g., cofactors, salts, water, promoters, etc. may be present during the conversion.

It will be understood that genetically engineered derivatives of these microorganisms may also be used in producing microbial cells and enzyme preparations derived from these cells. The maintenance of the cultures of these strains should be carefully controlled. The preferred means for maintaining the cultures is described below. MAINTENANCE OF CULTURES The organisms are preferably subcultured every two weeks on mineral salts agar plates which contain medium described in Example 1. These plates should be incubated in glass dessicators which have lids with an airtight seal and external sleeves with a tooled hose connection. Dessicators are to be evacuated and filled typically with a gas mixture of C2 C4 alkane and air 1 1 v v . Incubation should be at 300C. Cultures will survive in these dessicators for three months at 40C. However, frequent transfer of cultures is preferred. In commercial processes for the propagation of microorganisms, it is generally necessary to proceed by stages. These stages may be few or many, depending on the nature of the process and the characteristics of the microorganisms. Ordinarily, propagation is started by inoculating cells from a slant of a culture into a presterilized nutrient medium usually contained in a flask. In the flask, growth of the microorganisms is encouraged by various means, e.g., shaking for thorough aeration, and maintenance of suitable temperature. This step or stage is repeated one or more times in flasks or vessels containing the same or larger volumes of nutrient medium. These stages may be conveniently referred to as culture development stages.The microorganisms with or without accompanying culture medium, from the last development stage, are introduced or inoculated into a large scale fermentor to produce commercial quantities of the microorganisms or enzymes derived therefrom. Reasons for growing the microorganisms in stages are manifold, but are primarily dependent upon the conditions necessary for the growth of the microorganisms and or the production of enzymes therefrom.These include stability of the microorganisms, proper nutrients, pH, osmotic relationships, degree of aeration, temperature and the maintenance of pure culture conditions during fermentation. For instance, to obtain maximum yields of the microbial cells, the conditions of fermentation in the final stage may have to be changed somewhat from those practised to obtain growth of the microorganisms in the culture development stages.Maintaining the purity of the medium, also, is an extremely important consideration, especially where the fermentation is performed under aerobic conditions as in the case of the C2 C6 alkyl compound utilizing microorganisms of this invention. If the fermentation is initially started in a large fermentor, a relatively long period of time will be needed to achieve an appreciable yield of microorganisms and or oxygenase or dehydrogenase enzymes therefrom This, of course, enhances the possibility of contatination of the medium and mutation of the microorganisms. The culture media used for growing the microorganisms and inducing the oxidative enzyme system will be comprised of inorganic salts of phosphate, sulfates and nitrates as well as oxygen and a source of C2 C6 alkyl compounds. The fermentation will generally be conducted at temperatures ranging from 5 to about 500C, preferably at temperatures ranging from about 250 to about 450C. The pH of the culture medium should be controlled at a pH ranging from about 4 to 9 and preferably from about 5.5 to 8.5 and more preferably from 6.0 to 7.5. The fermentation may be conducted at atmospheric pressures, although higher pressures up to about 5 atmospheres and higher may be employed. Typically, to grow the microorganisms and to induce the oxygenase and dehydrogenase enzyme activity, the microorganisms are inoculated into the medium which contains the enzyme inducing growth and energy substrate e.g., ethane, butane, propane, ethanol, propanol, butanol. ethylamine, propylamine, butylamine, etc. and oxygen. For continuous flow culture the microorganisms may be grown in any suitably adapted fermentation vessel, for example, a stirred baffled fermentor or sparged tower fermentor, which is provided either with internal cooling or an external recycle cooling loop.Fresh medium may be continuously pumped into the culture at rates equivalent to 0.02 to 1 culture volume per hour and the culture may be removed at a rate such that the volume of culture remains constant. The inducergrowth substrate oxygen mixture and possibly carbon dioxide or other gases is contacted with the medium preferably by bubbling continuously through a sparger at the base of the vessel. The source of oxygen for the culture may be air, oxygen or oxygen enriched air. Spent gas may be removed from the head of the vessel.The spent gas may be recycled either through an external loop or internally by means of a gas inducer impeller.The gas flows and recycle should be arranged to give maximum growth of microorganism and maximum utilization of the inducing growth substrate. The microbial cells may be harvested from the growth medium by any of the standard techniques commonly used, for example, flocculation, sedimentation and or precipitation, followed by centrifugation and or filtration. The biomass may also be dried, e.g., by freeze or spray drying and may be used in this form for further use in the oxidative conversion process. In the case of the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme system one may conveniently use the enzyme in the form of the soluble extract which may be optionally immobilized onto an inert carrier . To put the invention to practice, the oxygenase and alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme system is obtained, such as, for example, in the manner described above wherein the microbial cells are derived from theC2 C6 alkyl compound utilizing microorganisms which have been aerobically grown in a nutrient medium containing the inducing growth substrate or enzyme preparations derived therefrom. The nutrient medium in which the microorganisms are induced and grown may be the culture medium described by Foster and Davis, J. Bacteriol., 91, 1924 1966 .Once the microorganisms have been induced and grown, the microbial cells are preferably harvested, washed and the resulting resting microbial cells or the resulting enzyme preparation may then be used as such to convert the substrates to the corresponding product s under aerobic conditions in the presence of oxygen in a buffered solution The mixture of the substrate material and induced microbial cells or enzyme preparation in the buffered solution is incubated until the desired degree of conversion has been obtained.Thereafter, the product is recovered by conventional means, e.g., distillation, etc. To facilitate the necessary effective contact of oxygen and the enzyme system whether it be an enzyme preparation as such or microbial cells derived from theC2 C6 alkyl compound induced microorganisms , it is preferred, for best results, to employ a strong, finely divided air stream into a vigorously stirred dispersion of the substrate in the oxidation medium, which generally contains water and a buffer, and in which the enzyme preparation or induced microbial cell system is suspended. The enzyme preparation or induced microbial cell system may then be separated from the liquid medium, preferably by filtration or centrifugation.The resulting product may then generally be obtained The process of the invention may be carried out batchwise, semicontinuously, continuously, concurrently or countercurrently. Optionally, the suspension containing the enzyme preparation or cells of microorganisms and buffer solution is passed downwardly with vigorous stirring countercurrently to an air stream rising in a tube reactor. The top layer is removed from the downflowing suspension, while culture and remaining buffer solution constituents are recycled, at least partly, with more oxidative substrate and addition of fresh enzyme preparation or induced microbial cell system, as required. The growth of the microorganisms and the oxidation process may be conveniently coupled by conducting them simultaneously, but separately and using much higher aeration in the oxidation process e.g., an air excess of at least twice that required for growth, preferably at least five times as much aeration . Both the growth process and the oxidative process may be conducted in the same reactor in sequential or simultaneous operations by alternate use of normal and strong aeration. The invention is illustrated further by the following examples which, however, are not to be taken as limiting in any respect. All parts and percentages, unless expressly stated otherwise, are by weight.EXAMPLE 1 A nutrient medium as described by Foster and Davis, J. Bacteriol., 91, 1924 1966 , supra, having the following composition per liter of water was prepared Na2HPo4 0.21 g NaH2Po4 0.09 g NaNO3 2.0 g MgsO4 7H20 0.2 g KC1 0.04 g Caul2 0.015 g FeSO4 7H2O 1 mg CuSO4 5H2O 0.01 mg H3B04 0.02 mg MnSO4 5H2O 0.02 mg ZnSO4 0.14 mg MoO3 0.02 mgThe pH of the nutrient medium was adjusted to 7.0 by the addition of acid or base, and 700 ml samples of the nutrient medium were charged into a plurality of 2.8 liter shake flasks.The shake flasks were inoculated with an inoculating loop of cells from an agar plate containing homogeneous colonies of the microorganisms on the plate the purity of the isolates was confirmed by microscopic examination . The isolates had been maintained on agar plates under an atmosphere of ethane, propane, or butane and air having a 1 1 V V gas ratio which had been transferred every two weeks. The gaseous phase of the inoculated flasks was replaced with a gas mixture comprised of ethane, propane or butane and air having a ratio of 1 1 on a V V basis. The inoculated flasks were sealed air tight and were incubated on a rotary shaker at 250 rpm and at 300C for two days until turbidity in the medium had developed. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 x g at 40C for 30 minutes.The cell pellet was washed twice with a 0.05 M phosphate buffer at a pH of 7.0 containing 0.005 M MgCl2 . The washed cells were then suspended in a 0.05 M phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 to obtain an optical density at 660 nm of 0.5. A 0.5 ml sample of each washed cell suspension 2 mg cells was put into separate 10 ml vials at 40C which were sealed with a rubber cap. The gaseous phase of the vials was removed with vacuum and then was replaced with a gas mixture of the substrate reactant i.e., alkane or hydrocarbon and oxygen at a 1 1 V V ratio. In the case of a liquid substrate, e.g., hexane, benzene and toluene, 10 ul of the substrate was put in the 10 ml vials . The vials were then incubated at 300C on a rotary shaker at 300 rpm. Samples of product 1 3 ul were withdrawn periodically with a microsyringe and the products were analyzed by gas chromatography ionization flame detector column at a column temperature of 1000C or 1200C and at a carrier gas flow rate of 30 or 35 ml min of helium. The various products were identified by retention time comparisons and co chromatography with authentic standards. The amount of product formed was determined from the peak area using a standard graph which had been constructed with an authentic standard. Protein in the cell suspensions was determined by the method described by 0. H.Lowry et al., J. Biol. Chem., 193, 265 1951 .EXAMPLE 2Microbiological Conversion of Linear Alkanes to MethylKetones Using Propane Grown Microorganism Strains The procedure of Example 1 was followed to grow a plurality of microorganism strains identified inTable I under aerobic conditions in a nutrient medium containing propane as the growth substrate. The cells were harvested and washed as described in Example 1.The resting microbial cells thus obtained were then contacted with C3 C6 n alkanes in a buffered solution by the procedure of Example 1. The results of this series of experiments are shown in Table I.EXAMPLE 3Microbiological Conversion of Linear Alkanes to MethylKetones Using Ethane and Butane Grown Microorganism Strains The procedure of Example 1 was followed for growth of three microorganism strains identified inTable II under aerobic conditions in a nutrient medium containing either ethane or butane as the growth substrate. The cells were harvested, washed and then contacted with C3 C6 n alkanes in a buffered solution by the procedure of Example 1. The results of these oxidative conversions are given in Table II.EXAMPLE 4Microbiological Conversion of Linear Alkanes to SecondaryAlcohols Using C2 C4 Alkane Grown Microorganism Strains Three of the microorganism strains fromExample 2 identified in Table III, which were grown under aerobic conditions in a nutrient medium containing ethane, propane or butane, and harvested, washed and then contacted with the C3 C6 n alkanes in a buffered solution by the procedure of Example 1, were analyzed for evidence of secondary alcohols as well as methyl ketones.

The results of these oxidative conversions are shown in Table IV.EXAMPLE 6Optimal Conditions for Alkane Oxidation The following summarizes tests conducted on the optimal conditions for the production of methyl ketones from alkanes. It will be understood that these were the optimal conditions found and that the invention is not to be bound thereby. Conversion can still be obtained by deviating from the optimum values indicated below, but with lower yields and conversions.

Therefore, the production of methyl ketone was measured within one hour of incubation whenever the effedct of a variable was tested. pH The effect of pH on the production of acetone or 2 butanone from propane or n butane, respectively, using cell suspensions of propane grown Rhodococcus rhodochrous Nocardia paraffinica ATCC 21198 was studied, wherein a 0.05M phosphate buffer was used for pH values from 5.5 to 8.0 and a 0.05M tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane HCl buffer for pH values from 8.0 to 10.0. The optimum pH for the production of acetone and 2 butanone was about 7.5. Temperature The optimum temperature for the production of acetone or 2 butanone from propane or n butane, respectively, using cell suspensions of propane grownRhodococcus rhodochrous Nocardia paraffinica ATCC 21198 was about 350C. Substrate Specificity From Tables I, II and III it can be seen that methyl ketones and secondary alcohols were produced from n alkanes. Among the n alkanes, n propane and n butane were oxidized at the highest rate. From Table IV it is seen that alcohols were produced from cyclohexane, benzene and toluene for at least one strain tested. Product and Enzyme Analysis All of the strains tested exhibited the ability to catalyze formation of methyl ketones. Some cultures, such as Rhodococcus rhodochrous Nocardia paraffinica ATCC 21198 and Brevibacterium fuscum ATCC 15993, showed greater activity for methyl ketone formation. Al kane grown cells of at least three microorganism oxidized C3 to C6 alkanes to their corresponding 2 alcohols and methyl ketones. In propane grown cells, propane is metabolized through either terminal or subterminal oxidation. J. R.Vestal et al., J. Bacteriol., 99, 216 1969 , usingBrevibacterium sp. JOB5, and E. R. Leadbetter et al.,Arch. Mikrobiol., 35, 92 1960 , using M. smegmatis 422, suggested that propane was metabolized via subterminal oxidation. From the majority of propane grown strains tested in the experiments herein 2 propanol and acetone were obtained from propane but not l propanol. To test if the propane monooxygenase system is a specific enzyme for subterminal oxidation or a nonspecific enzyme catalyzing both terminal and subterminal oxidation, so that l propanol was produced but could not be detected, the following experiment was performed. l Propanol, 2 propanol, or acetone in amounts of 0.3 to 0.4 Umoles ml cell suspension was incubated with cell suspensions of both viable and heat killed cells of propane grown Rhodococcus rhodochrous Nocardia paraffinica ATCC 21198. The rates of disappearance of substrates were followed by gas liquid chromatography.Suspensions of the heat killed cells did not oxidize any of these substrates however, with viable cells all of the l propanol added had disappeared oxidized within 6 min. of incubation. When the reaction mixture using 1 propanol as substrate was acidified, extracted with benzene and then methylated with BF3 methanol, the presence of the methyl ester of propionic acid was confirmed by gas liquid chromatography. 2 Propanol was also oxidized by the viable cell suspensions during the 90 min. incubation period. The 2 propanol is further oxidized to acetone, which accumulates, and the l pro panol is further oxidized at a much faster rate to acid through aldehyde.EXAMPLE 7Cell Free Soluble Fraction alkane monooxygenase The Oxidation of Alkanes, Cyclic and Aromatic Compounds The microorganism Pseudomonas fluorescens NRRLB 1244 was grown on propane 7 propane and 93 air at 300C in a batch culture on a mineral salt medium as described in Example 1 in a 30 liter fermentor NewBrunswick Scientific Co., Edison, N.J. . The fermentor was inoculated with 2 liters of a culture grown in flasks. The cells thus grown were washed twice with 25 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.0 and suspended in the same buffer solution containing 5mM MgC12 and deoxyribonuclease 0.05 mg ml . Cell suspensions at 40C were disintegrated by a single passage through aFrench pressure cell American Instruments Co., SilverSpring, Md. at 60 mPa. Disintegrated cell suspensions were centrifuged at 15,000 x g for 15 min. to remove unbroken cells. The supernatant solution was then centrifuged at 40,000 x g for 60 minutes and the supernatant solution therefrom was again centrifuged at 80,000 x g for 60 minutes, yielding the soluble fraction. Several 3 ml vials at 40C were charged with 0.2 ml of a reaction mixture consisting of 10 U moles potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.0, 4 p moles NADH2, and the soluble enzyme fraction obtained above. The gaseous phase of the vials was evacuated by vacuum and replaced with a gas mixture of gaseous oxidation substrate and oxygen 1 1 v v in the case of a liquid oxidation substrate, 2 p1 of substrate was added. The vials were incubated at 350C on a reciprocating water bath shaker at 50 oscillations per minute. The rate of epoxidation of alkenes and styrene was measured by injecting 1 2 p1 samples of the reaction mixture into a gas chromatograph immediately after addition of substrate zero time and after 5 and 10 min.of incubation. Specific activities were expressed as moles of product formed per 10 min. per mg of protein.With each substrate, control experiments were conducted in the absence of NADH2, in the absence of oxygen, and using boiled extracts. The results obtained are shown in Table V.

Conversions can still be obtained by deviating from the optimum values indicated below, but with lower yields and conversions. Time Course The production of propylene oxide from propylene reached a maximum after 2 to 3 hours of incubation in batch experiments for all the microorganism strains tested. The amount of propylene oxide did not decline after 20 hours of incubation. The rate of propylene oxide production was linear for. the first 60 minutes. Therefore, the production of propylene oxide was measured within one hour of incubation whenever the effect of a variable was tested. pH The effect of pH on the production of propylene oxide was studied using 0.05 M sodium phosphate buffer for pH values from 5.5 to 8.0 and using 0.05 M tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane HCl buffer for pH values of 8.0 to 10.0. The optimum pH for the production of propylene oxide was found to be in the range from 6.0 to 7.0 for all resting cell suspensions of the strains tested. Temperature The optimum temperature for the propylene oxide production by cell suspensions was about 350C for all strains tested. Product and Conversion Analysis n Propanol grown cells showed no activity for epoxidation of propylene. Propane grown cells in the form of resting cell suspensions yielded propylene oxide, which accumulated extracellularly. Control experiments with heat killed cells indicated that the epoxide was produced enzymatically. No product peak other than propylene oxide was detected. Although S.W.May et al, J. Biol. Chem., 248, 1725 1973 reported epoxide accumulation from l octene by Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells was accompanied by metabolism of a large amount of l octene via methyl group oxidation, the epoxidation of propylene by cell suspensions of propanegrown bacterial cells herein yielded no production of 3 hydroxy l propene. Substrate Specificity From Table I it can be seen that epoxides were produced from both gaseous l alkenes and liquid alkenes as well as butadiene. The highest production of epoxides was found using ethylene or propylene as substrate for all propane grown strains tested. Substrate specificity for epoxidation of l alkenes and butadiene by various ethane and butanegrown bacterial cells was also studied see Table VII .Both strains tested oxidized l alkenes and butadiene to their corresponding 1,2 epoxides, with the preferred substrate being propylene. EXAMPLE 11Cell Free Soluble Fraction alkane monooxygenase The Epoxidation of Alkenes and Styrene The microorganism Pseudomonas fluorescens NRRLB 1244 was grown on propane 7 propane and 93 air at 300C in a batch culture on a mineral salt medium as described in Example 1 in a 30 liter fermentor NewBrunswick Scientific Co., Edison, N.J. .

When the cofactor is depleted, it can be regenerated by the addition of compounds which are substrates for dehydrogenases or oxidases such as alcohol primary and or secondary dehydrogenase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, formate dehydrogenase, steroid dehydrogenase , etc. in either cell free or whole cell systems.The overall catalyst system is stabilized by coupling this cofactor regeneration system to the epoxidation reaction process. A schematic explanation of the coupling cycle for the regeneration of cofactor is shown below EMI47.1 wherein E1 is the monooxygenase enzyme, E2 is the dehydrogenase enzyme and S is the substrate for cofactor regeneration.Cofactor regeneration through ethanol dehydrogenase Two microorganism strains indicated in TableIX were grown on propane and used to epoxidize propylene to propylene oxide as described in Example 1, except that varying amounts of ethanol were added to the reaction mixtures in separate experiments, ethanol being a cofactor regeneration substrate. Ethanol was converted to acetaldehyde acetyl Cob A in vivo by primary alcohol dehydrogenase, yielding 1 mole of NADB, with subsequent oxidation of the intermediate acetyl Cho A to carbon dioxide, yielding 3 additional moles of NADH. The results, indicated in Table IX, show that the epoxidation rate was improved on addition of 5 U mole ethanol.Some inhibition was observed at higher ethanol concentration 25 pmoles within the first two hours of reaction.

It will be understood that these were the optimal conditions found and that the invention is not to be bound thereby. Conversions can still be obtained by deviating from the optimum values indicated below, but with lower yields and conversions. Time Course The rate of production of methyl ketones from secondary alcohols by cell suspension of various C2 C4 alkane grown microorganism strains was linear for the first three hours of incubation. Therefore, the production of methyl ketone was measured within three hours of incubation whenever the effect of a variable was tested. The effect of pH on the production of acetone or 2 butanone from 2 propanol or 2 butanol, respectively, using cell suspensions of propane grown Rhodococcus rhodochrous Nocardia paraffinica ATCC 21198 was studied, wherein a 0.05 M phosphate buffer was used for pH values from 5.5 to 8.0 and a 0.05 M tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane HCl buffer for pH values from 8.0 to 10.0. The optimum pH for the production of acetone and 2 butanone was in the range of about 8.0 to 9.0. Temperature The optimum temperature for the production of acetone or 2 butanone from 2 propanol or 2 butanol, respectively, using cell suspensions of propane grownRhodococcus rhodochrous Nocardia paraffinica ATCC 21198 was about 350C. Substrate Specificity From Table X it can be seen that methyl ketones were produced from secondary alcohols using alkane grown cells. From Table XI it can be seen that methyl ketones were produced from secondary alcohols using alcohol or alkylamine grown cells. Among the secondary alcohols, 2 propanol and 2 butanol were oxidized at the highest rate. Some cultures, such asRhodococcus rhodochrous Nocardia paraffinica ATCC 21198 and Brevibacterium fuscum ATCC 15993, showed greater activity for methyl ketone formation. Enzyme Analysis It was reported by C. T. Hou et al., App.Environ. Microbiol., 38, 135 1979 that a secondary alcohol specific dehydrogenase SADH catalyzed the oxidation of 2 alcohols to their corresponding methyl ketones using methylotrophic bacteria and methanol grown yeast. In the present invention, SADH activity was found in the propane grown and l propanol grown cells of the microorganisms. In summary, the present invention is seen to provide a process for oxidation of several hydrocarbons by contacting them under aerobic conditions with cells derived from selected microorganisms or enzyme preparations thereof which were previously grown aerobically in the presence of a C2 C6 alkane or, if the hydrocarbon is a secondary alcohol, also a C2 C6 alkyl radical donating compound such as an alcohol or alkylamine.
