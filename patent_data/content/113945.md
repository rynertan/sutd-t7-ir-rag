## Description
AMINE SALTS The present invention concerns novel salts of certain benzimidazole compounds, which salts are useful for the control of insects. The novel salts are of the formulaEMI1.1 wherein RÚ is bromo, chloro, CF3, CF2Br, or CF2Cl Rê is perfluoroalkyl of C1 C3 alkyl or CF2 CF2R wherein R is hydrogen or C1 C6 alkyl R4 is a substituted ammonium cation derived A from an organic amine and n is the valence of R , the said salts having a Kow 150 in the system octanol water. The present salts ar prepared by conventional procedures. The benzimidazole salts of formula T are prepared by reacting a compound of the formulaEMI1.2 wherein R1 and R2 are defined as before 1 with an organic amine, R4, which is defined as before, in the presence of an aprotic solvent or 2 with an alkali metal hydroxide or an alkali metal carbonate , followed by reacting the alkali metal salt with an appropriate salt of the R4 organic amine, in the presence of a protic solvent or A 3 with an organic amine, R4, which is defined as before, or with an appropriate salt of theR4 organic amine, in the, presence of a protic solvent and step 2 or 3 above is further followed by drying the resulting benzimidazoline salt of the formulaEMI2.1 wherein R1, R2, R4 and n are defined as before, and R is hydrogen or C1 C alkyl. Also contemplated by the present Invention is an ectoparasiticidal formulation comprising as active ingredient a benzimidazole salt of formula I, associated with one or more acceptable carriers or diluents therefore. In this formulation the amount of active ingredient of formula I preferably present is from 1 to 98 by weight. The substituted ammonium cation derived from an organic amine, R4, is generated by protonation of a primary, secondary or tertiary organic amine or is a quarternary radical. The methods used to prepare this cation are conventional. The identity of the substituted ammonium cation is not critical so lonq as it confers substantial lipophilicity on the salt. The salt should have a partition coefficient in the system of n octanol and water of Kow 150. The alkali metal hydroxide or alkali metal carbonates that are used in preparing the salts of formula I are preferably, sodium or potassium hydroxide and sodium or potassium carbonate, and more preferably sodium hydroxide. The reaction is carried out in a suitable solvent, preferably aprotic solvents such as the ethers, e.g. diethyl ether, and halogenated hydrocarbons, preferably methylene chloride. Protic solvents such as water and the C1 C4 alkanols can be employed however, their use favors the conversion of the intended product into the corresponding benzimidazoline salt of formula III above. The two salts of formula I and III can be distinguished as set forth in U. S. Patent No.4,265,901. The temperature at which the reaction is, conducted is not critical the reaction goes forward over a wide range of temperatures, such as from 0 to 1000 C., but generally room temperature or a slight elevation over room temperature is entirely adequate.If the corresponding benzimidazoline salt of formulaIII is obtained it can be converted back to the desired benzimidazole salt of formula I by drying, under reduced pressure or by azeotropic distillation.Otherwise, workup of the reaction mixture to isolate the intended product is carried out in routine manner. The following examples illustrate the preparation of representative salts of formula I and will enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention.EXAMPLE 1 2 1,1,2,2 TETRAFLUOROETHYL 4 NITRO 6 TRIFLUOROMETHYL BENZIMIDAZOLE, TETRA n BUTYLAMMONIUMSALT 2 1,1,2,2 Tetrafluoroethyl 4 nitro 6 trifluoromethyl benzimidazole 33.1 grams was dissolved in about 200 ml. of methylene chloride and excess tetra n butylammonium hydroxide was added The resulting reaction mixture was stirred for half an hour, then washed with two 50 ml. portions cf water, dried over magnesium sulfate, and evaporated, yielding 50 grams of a viscous oil.

The salts of formula I exhibit insecticidal action and can be employed for the control of insects in a wide variety of settings. For example, the salts can be employed for the control of insects which attack plants as well as insects which are pests to animals and humans. The salts are particularly useful for the control of colonial insects, household insects, and those insects which attack domestic anirials, such as flies, lice, mites, ticks, and fleas. Colonial insects are generally members of the order Hvmenoptera, familyFormicidae ants and the order Isontera, familyTermitidae termites . The present salts are especially of interest for the control of fire ants, including Solenopsis aeminata, Solenopsis richteri,Solenopsis invicta, and Solenopsis xyloni.For the control of ants, the present salt is formulated in an edible bait which is positioned near the colony to be controlled, or, in the case of infested cropland, the edible bait can be distributed uniformly across the infested land. The amount of a present salt to be employed will vary with such factors as the identity of the ant, the size and number of colonies, the ode of application, and the like. Cenerally, good results are obtained by application of from 1 to 100 grams acre, preferably 1 to 10 grams acre. Baits containing a present salt of formula I are prepared in manners conventional for the species to be controlled. For many ant species, including fire ants, the present salt is dissolved in an oil or fat which is then distributed on a carrier to constitute the edible bait. The salts of formula I have been evaluated as toxicants for the control of imported fire ant Solenopsis richteri . The evaluation was conducted as follows. The candidate compound of formula I was formulated by dissolving it in soybean oil, with heat if necessary. If not soluble upon heating, acetone was added and later removed by evaporation. The resulting solution was placed on defattedopregelled corn grits as carrier, 30 solution and 70 carrier, to constitute a bait suitable for ingestion by ants. Three baits were prepared for each compound, at concentrations of 0.01, 0.1 and 1.0 in the bait. Imported fire ants were collected from the field, acclimated to laboratory conditions for a week, and then employed in the test. A group of about 40 ants was exposed to the respective bait for 24 hours, then the ants were supplied witO an untreated bait of soybean oil on defatted pregelled corn grits carrier for the remainder of the two week test period.Throughout, the ants were maintained in an environment of controlled temperature and humidity. Dead ants were removed and counted daily cumulative percent kill and control were calculated at days 1, 4, 7 and 14 of the test period. Results were as reported in the following table. Each line represents a single test, with individual figures being an average of three replicates. Multiple tests were conducted with the compounds.

For this purpose, the salt can be applied topically or the salt can be administered orally or by injection. The salts are preferably formulated for this use with conventional adjuvants.The amount of salt to be used is not critical and will vary with the identity of the host and the insect parasite, the severity and duration of attack and other factors. In general, good results are achieved at rates of from 1 to about 50 mg. kg. The present salts are advantageous in that when administered to warm blooded animals, they are only slowly taken up by the bloodstream the present salts therefore provide ectoparasiticidal effect over a period of time. The same delay in being taken up by the bloodstream has the effect of minimizing any toxic action the anion might otherwise exhibit to the host. Various of the salts of formula I were evaluated for ectoparasiticidal activity. In these tests, the candidate was formulated for administration to cattle, then administered and blood saiples thereafter withdrawn daily for a period of time varying from several weeks to several months. From the blood samples, the serum was isolated and blowfly larvae and adult houseflies were fed on the serum. For the blowfly assay, 10 ml. of serum were placed in a test tube with a wick onto which 50 blowfly larvae were placed. The covered test tube was incubated at 270 C. for 24 hours, at which time efficacy of the candidate compound was determined as the percent mortality of the blowfly larvae, adjusted by normal mortality in a control, and reported according to the following rating scale Rating Mortality 0 none dead I 50 dead 2 51 75 dead 3 76 902 dead 4 91 998 dead 5 100 dead For the adult housefly test, 10 ml. of serum were employed to saturate a wick which was placed in a petri dish. Tenty five chilled houseflies were placed in the dish which was then incubated for 24 hours at 270 C. and 50 relative humidity. After the end of the twenty four hours, the efficacy of the candidate compound of formula I was determined as the percent mortality of housefly, adjusted as for blowfly by normal mortality in a control and reported according to the same scale as above. In addition to the blowfly larvae assay and the adult housefly assays, the blood was analyzed for the concentration of the test compound, as the corresponding 2 hydroxy 2 1,1,2,2 tetrafluoroethyl 4 nitro 6 trifluoromethyl benzimidazoline anion of formula III. The results of these evaluations are set forth in the following tables. Each set of data represents a single animal. Compounds were formulated for injection in either 1 tr iacetin saturated with water or 2 benzyl alcohol, at a concentration of 200 mg. ml. or 250 mg. ml., respectively in either instance the indicated amount was as the corresponding 2 hydroxy 2 1,1,2,2 tetrafluoroethyl 4 nitro 6 trifluoromethyl benzimidazoline anion. In each evaluation, 5 mg. as the latter anion was supplied per kg. of animal body weight.
