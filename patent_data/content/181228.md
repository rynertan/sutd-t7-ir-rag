## Description
The present invention relates to color sensors, and more particularly, to sensors for measuring the reflective and fluorescent properties of various objects such as paper. In industry, it is often important to accurately measure the color of an object as it is being manufactured. For instance, purchasers of paper frequently require the paper color to accurately match the color of previous purchases. Thus, paper manufacturers need to measure and control the color of paper to a previously determined value. In the absence of fluorescence, the whiteness or color of an object is in general determined by the way the object absorbs and reflects light across the visible spectrum which when defined in terms of wavelength, is approximately 380 to 780 nanometers nm . For example, white objects reflect light evenly across the spectrum while colored objects absorb some wavelengths or color and reflect others. Color sensors typically illuminate the object and measure the intensity of the reflected light at each of a number of wavelengths. Each measured intensity of reflected light can be related to a previously measured intensity of light which has been reflected from a white standard to provide a reflectance co efficient at each wavelength. The set of reflectance co efficients is often referred to as the color spectrum of the object. Because paper naturally has a somewhat offwhite or straw color, fluorescent whitening agents FWA in the form of dyes are often added to the paper pulp to give the finished paper product a whiter appearance. Fluorescence is the phenomenon in which energy is absorbed over a range of wavelengths the excitation band and then reemitted in a lower energy longer wavelength bond referred to as the emission band. Fluorescent whitening agents typically absorb the violet and ultraviolet energies and remit this energy in the blue range to give the paper a whiter appearance. The degree to which the object or paper illuminated by a particular source is made to appear bluer or whiter by the FWA depends upon the proportion of the energy emitted by the source in the violet and ultraviolet regions as compared to the blue and other lower energy spectra, and also upon the effective concentration level of the fluorescent agent. Thus, if the excitation emission spectrum of the source changes, the amount of fluorescence and hence the color of the object will change. The emission spectra of various standard sources have been defined by the Commission Internationale de L Eclairage CIE but attempts to build standard sources which exactly duplicate the defined spectra have been largely unsuccessful. As a result, the emission spectra of the sources used in color sensors usually varies from sensor to sensor so that measured color spectra for a given fluorescent object also varies, although they may agree quite satisfactorily on non fluorescent objects. The effective FWA concentration level in an object has been measured using highly sophisticated techniques. In one such technique, a standard object having a known FWA concentration is first illuminated by a source and the intensity of the light received from the object is measured. The object is then reilluminated after a filter which eliminates the light in the excitation band is placed over the source, and a second measurement is taken. The difference in these two measurements is directly related to the effective FWA concentration in the standard. The process is repeated for a sample of unknown FWA concentration and the two difference measurements are compared to determine the effective FWA concentration in the sample. This technique is typically very cumbersome since it involves the mechanical movement of a filter in front of the source and is therefore relatively slow. Consequently, it is difficult to rapidly measure the FWA concentration which makes the technique less practical for many on line applications such as measuring the FWA concentration in paper as it emerges from the paper making process. Also since the paper has moved substantially between the two intervals of measurement, it cannot be assumed that the difference is solely a function of the FWA concentration. Any variation in a number of other attributes of the paper, such as opacity or whiteness, at the two points of measurement, could also affect the results. In EP A 181 155, a system is described for measuring the color of a sample material such as a sheet of paper. The system includes means for illuminating the sample and a sensor to measure light from the sample. Sample backing means are provided to receive light transmitted by the sample and reflect this light back to the sample. The illuminating means include a light source producing light in the visible range, and a light source producing ultraviolet light. The intensities of light reflected by the sample at various frequencies are detected, giving a measurement of the color of the sample. GB A 822 447 describes a method and apparatus for the measurement and evaluation of fluorescent substances, for example, optical bleaches in a sample such as paper or a textile material. Ultraviolet light obtained by passing light from a suitable source through a U.V. filter is directed at the sample containing the fluorescent substance. The reflected light is then passed through color filters placed one at a time in the path of the reflected light. The light transmitted through the color filter is detected by a photocell. From the measurement made the fluorescent properties can be evaluated. It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved method and apparatus of determining the fluorescent properties of a sample. It is a further object of the present invention to provide an improved method and apparatus for determining the color spectrum for a sample which contains fluorescent agents if illuminated by a defined source. According to the present invention there is provided a color sensor for detecting fluorescence of a fluorescent sample, the sensor comprising a first source of light positioned to illuminate the sample, and at least one light detector for detecting light reflected or emitted by the sample when illuminated by said first source, characterised in that the sensor additionally comprises a second source of light positioned to illuminate the sample, at least a portion of the light emitted by the second source being in the excitation band of the fluorescent sample, means for modulating the intensity of the second source independently of the first, and means for measuring the energy received from the sample in phase synchronism with the modulation of the second source. According to the present invention there is further provided a method of determining the fluorescent property of a sample containing a fluorescent agent FA , comprising the steps of illuminating said sample with a first light source with light of a first spectrum simultaneously to illuminating said sample with a second light source with light of a second spectrum, which second spectrum overlaps the excitation spectral range of said fluorescent agents to a greater degree than said first spectrum simultaneously to modulating the intensity of said illumination by the second light source relative to to the intensity of said illumination by the first light source simultaneously to detecting the intensity emitted from said sample from both of said illuminations respectively, with a detector and calculating the fluorescent property of said sample from the difference between the two intensity detections. In an embodiment of the apparatus of the present invention a color sensor is provided which has two light sources for illuminating an object or sample. One light source, such as an ultraviolet source, emits light primarily in the excitation range of the fluorescent agent in the object. Data is taken in two interleaved phases. In phase 1, both sources are on and in phase 2, the source emitting energy primarily in the excitation range is turned off while the other source remains on. In an embodiment of the apparatus of the present invention, a single measurement operation comprises accumulation of data in a relatively large number 10 of each of the two phases. This is advantageous since the accumulated data in each phase accurately represents the average product during the total measurement interval. The sensor may be standardized by illuminating a standard of known fluorescent efficiency and known true reflectance i.e., reflectance measured in the absence of fluorescent exciting radiation , to determine both the excitation energy of the ultraviolet source as well as the second source. Then, a sample of unknown FWA concentration may be illuminated by the sources and by comparing the data accumulated in each of the two phases during the measurement, the FWA concentration level can be determined. Furthermore, in another aspect of the present invention, the color spectrum of the sample if illuminated by an ideal CIE source or other defined source can be calculated. The invention will be further described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 shows two color spectra, indicated at 10 and 12, which show the distribution of light received from an object here a sample of white paper as a function of wavelength when illuminated by different types of sources. The first color spectrum 10 depicts the intensity or brightness of the light received from the sample for a range of wavelengths where fluorescence is absent or suppressed. The energy at each wavelength is expressed in terms of a reflectance co efficient where 100 represents the reflection of a perfectly white object. As shown in Figure 1, the color spectrum 10 drops off at the shorter wavelengths or higher energies which are at the blue violet end of the spectrum. Because the yellow red end of the spectrum is brighter, that is, more energy in the longer wavelengths is reflected by the sample than in the shorter wavelengths, the sample will appear beige or straw colored. In order to give the paper a whiter appearance, a fluorescent whitening agent FWA can be added to the paper during the paper making process to boost the blue wavelength energy received from the sample as represented by the color spectrum 12. Since the color spectrum 12 is relatively flat throughout the visible spectrum, the sample will have a white appearance. As previously mentioned, the fluorescent whitening agents absorb light from the source which is in their excitation band and re emit the light in a lower energy longer wavelength emission band. As shown in Figure 2, the excitation band for a typical fluorescent whitening agent is in the violet and ultraviolet range and the emission band is primarily in the blue range. Consequently, the degree to which a paper is made to appear bluer and therefore whiter by the FWA depends upon the balance of energy in the violet and ultraviolet regions less than 430 nm of the source as compared to the blue regions, as well as the effective FWA concentration. The distribution of energy in terms of wavelength for two different CIE defined sources is illustrated in Figure 3. The distribution indicated at 18 is for the CIE standard source designated C . The second distribution 20, for the CIE source D65 , indicates that the D65 source is brighter in the 300 400 nanometer range whereas the source C is brighter in the 400 to 500 nanometer range. Consequently, a paper sample with FWA is likely to appear bluer if illuminated by the source D65 as compared to the source C. However, the sources D65 and C as defined in Figure 3 like most sources are extremely difficult to accurately duplicate. Thus, even if two color sensors both utlize D65 sources, the sensors are likely to yield somewhat different color spectra for a single sample containing FWA. Referring now to Figure 4, a color sensor in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention is indicated generally at 22. The color sensor 22 has a first source 24 of light which is used to illuminate the object to be tested, which in the illustrated embodiment is a sheet 26 of paper. The source 24 has a heat filter 28 to block infrared radiation and a color correcting filter 30 to redistribute the wavelengths at which the light is emitted. The light source 24 is, in the illustrated embodiment, an incandescent tungsten lamp modified by the color correcting filter so that its emission spectrum roughly approximates CIE illuminate C which therefore emits a significant amount of light in the ultraviolet or excitation range of fluorescent whitening agents. Accordingly, the paper 26 both reflects light from the source 24 and re emits light absorbed from the source 24 in the emission range of the FWA. The light reflected and emitted by the paper 26 is focused by a lens 34 through on aperture or slit 36 onto a folding mirror 40 of a wavelength dispersing assembly 42. The folding mirror 40 reflects the energy from the lens 34 onto a holographic grating 44 which disperses the energy by wavelength into a spectrum much like a rainbow and reflects the light back to the folding mirror 40A. The spectrum is reflected by the folding mirror 40A onto an array 46 of 32 diodes, each of which generates an electrical signal proportional to the total energy in the range of wavelengths which is directed to that particular diode. The electrical output of each diode of the diode array 46 is sensed by a preamplifier and read by a computer 48 as shown in the illustrated embodiment . The computer 48 includes a central processing unit or CPU 50, a memory 52, input output I O 54 and preamplifiers and multiplexers 56 for reading and processing the data from the diode array 46. The above described elements 24 56 are well known to those skilled in the art and need not be described in greater detail. In accordance with the present invention, the color sensor 22 has a second source 60 which emits light primarily in the excitation band of the fluorescent whitening agent. The second source 60 is an ultraviolet lamp in the illustrated embodiment, has a band pass filter 64, which transmits energy substantially in the excitation band of the FWA only. The second source 60 is rapidly turned on and off while the first source 24 remains on. As will be more fully discussed below, data is obtained while the second source 60 is on and also while the second source 60 is off. Differences in the two sets of data are used to compute the fluorescent whitening agent efficiency, or effective FWA concentration. Furthermore, a corrected color spectrum can be determined which would be obtained if the sample were illuminated by a defined source. To calibrate the diodes of the diode array 46, the color sensor 22 has a plurality of standards 80 which are carried on a wheel 82. The standards include a very white sample which is moved in position by a stepper motor 84 to calibrate the sensor. Sensor calibration techniques are well known in the art. After the sensor 22 has been calibrated, it is used to read a fluorescent standard sample with known fluorescent properties in order to determine the excitation energy in the ultraviolet source 60 as well as in the incandescent source 24. Figure 5 shows an example of two color spectra which were obtained by the color sensor 22 when reading a sample with a high effective FWA concentration. One diode of the diode array 46 is positioned to measure the energy of the light received from the sample at the 390 nanometer wavelength and another diode is positioned to measure the energy at the 700 nanometer wavelength, with the remaining 30 diodes being positioned to measure the energy at the wavelengths inbetween at 10 nanometer increments. The sensor produces the first spectrum A using both the UV source 60 and the incandescent source 24. In the illustrated embodiment, the outputs from the diode array 46 are read several times by the computer 48 to obtain an accumulated set of 32 data points during phase 1 in which both sources remain on. In phase 2, the UV source 60 is turned off while the incandescent source 24 remains on , and the output of the diode array 46 is again road several times to produce an accumulated phase 2 spectrum. As previously mentioned, the UV source 60 is cyclicly turned on and off, with the results of each cycle added to the previous accumulation. After a preset measurement interval, the computer stops data acquisition. An average intensity for each diode in phase 1 is then computed and stored in the computer as spectrum A for the fluorescent standard sample over the 390 700 nanometer range. Similarly, the intensity measurements from each diode of the diode array 46 while the UV source was off phase 2 are averaged and stored by the computer producing the second spectrum B representing the energy of the light received from the standard sample when only the incandescent source 24 is on. As shown in Figure 5, the light from the standard sample is brighter at the bluish end of the spectra when the UV source 60 is on. The scaled difference between the two color spectra A and B plotted in Figure 6 is stored in the computer. The increased brightness of the A spectrum is a result of the additional blue light emitted by the fluorescent whitening agent. The difference between the two color spectra A and B can be represented below as where X represents the efficiency of the FWA standard to produce fluorescent emission at wavelength λ when illuminated by a standard, fluorescence exciting source. Since the shape of the spectrum is fixed by the FWA dye emission curve, e.g., Fig. 2, it is sufficient to re write equation 1 at a single wavelength where we define and the wavelength is chosen to be the peak wavelength, λ As previously mentioned, the fluorescent coefficient F whereby the excitation energy X Equation 1 may also be rewritten as where brackets denote an average of the quantity within over the wavelength range λmin to λmax. This average may reduce to measurement at a single wavelength λ An additional quantity which is important to be determined is the excitation energy X where the color spectrum C is the distribution of light which would be received from the standard sample if fluorescence was completely suppressed. In other words, the C spectrum shows the reflectance properties only of a sample, and is obtained for the standard sample using known laboratory techniques and equipment. The C spectrum for the standard sample is stored in the computer and is utilized after the B spectrum has been obtained to compute the excitation energy X After the color sensor 22 has been standardized as described above, the color sensor 22 is ready to measure a sample of unknown fluorescent coefficient FWA concentration . Figure 4 shows a sheet 26 of paper positioned to be read by the color sensor 22. The color sensor 22 may be used in a paper mill for example to measure the fluorescent properties and the color of paper as it is produced. Of course, the color sensor 22 is also suitable for color measurements of other objects and other fluorescent agents FA . To read the sample 26, the incandescent source 24 again remains on while the UV source 60 is cyclicly modulated on and off. The intensities measured by the color sensor 22 at the 32 wavelength increments yield two color spectra designated A and B as shown in Figure 7. As before, the color spectrum B represents the measured relative intensities of the light received from the sample 26 when only the incandescent source 24 is on and the A spectrum represents the measured relative intensities when the light from the UV source 60 is added to that of the incandescent source 24 to illuminate the sample 26. Since the excitation energy X Having determined the fluorescent efficiency of the sample 26, the color spectrum C which would be obtained for the sample 26 if fluorescence was totally suppressed can be calculated by rearranging equation 4 as where the excitation energy X In the illustrated embodiment, the source excitation energies X Having determined the fluorescent efficiency spectrum F λ and the suppressed fluorescence color spectrum C λ of the sample 26, a color spectrum D which would be produced by the sample 26 if illuminated by an ideal CIE source can now be calculated where the excitation energy X It is seen that the spectrum D λ is fully corrected to a true standard defined source. The D λ spectrum can therefore be used for all subsequent calculations of color coordinates and whiteness or brightness for comparison purposes. Figure 8 shows a lamp driver circuit 100 for the UV source 60 of Figure 4. The driver circuit 100 includes an oscillator 102 which outputs a 35 kilohertz clock signal to a pulse generator 104. The computer 48 of Figure 4 outputs,a 20 hertz on off signal depicted at A in Figure 9 to the pulse generator 104, to control the on off modulation of the source 60 at a 20 hertz rate as depicted at B in Figure 9. Thus, the source 60 is on for 25 millisecond ms and off for 25 ms of each cycle. During the 25 ms on period, the source 60 is actually pulsed in the illustrated embodiment to increase lamp life. Accordingly, during the 25 ms on period of the source 60, the pulse generator 104 generates two drive signals, X and Y, which are coupled to the gates of two FET transistor switches 106 and 108, respectively. The drive signals X and Y are depicted at A and B in Figure 10 and each have a 30 microsecond period with a 3 microsecond pulse width which is set by an input 110 of the pulse generator 104. As shown in Figure 10, the drive signals X and Y are 180 out of phase, and thus the switches 106 and 108 are closed 180 out of phase. A transformer 112 having a primary coil 114 coupled to the switches 106 and 108 is energized by the alternate closing of the switches 106 and 108 by the drive signals X and Y, respectively. A secondary coil 116 of the transformer 112 produces an oscillating output voltage represented at C in Figure 10, which is applied across the UV source 60 through a ballast resistor 118. The oscillating voltage across the source causes the source 60 to pulse once every 15 microseconds as indicated at D in Figure 10. This rapid pulsing of the uv source 60 during the 25ms on period of the source 60 is represented by the vertical lines of the waveform at B in Figure 9. Because the preamplifiers 56 coupled to the outputs of the diode array 46 have a time constant of approximately 2 1 2 milliseconds, the UV source 60 is effectively on constantly with respect to the array 46 during the 25 millisecond on period. After the UV source 60 is turned on at the start of each 25 millisecond on period, the computer 48 waits approximately 10 milliseconds before reading the 32 diodes to allow sufficient time for the preamplifiers to respond to the new lighting condition. The 32 diodes are read 3 or 4 times at 5 millisecond intervals to obtain 3 or 4 sets of data for the 32 diodes while both the UV source 60 and the incandescent source 24 are on. During the 25 millisecond off period, the sequence is repeated, waiting 10 milliseconds before taking 3 or 4 sets of data while only the incandescent source 24 is on. This cycle of taking data while the UV source 60 is off for 25ms and then while the UV source 60 is on for 25ms is repeated for approximately a second to define a data measurement interval or segment. Data from each diode while the UV source 60 was off is averaged over the whole data segment to produce the data points plotted in the B spectrum previously described. Similarly, the data for each diode taken while the UV source 60 was on is averaged over the whole data segment to produce the A spectrum. The rapid interleaving of data reads under the two lighting conditions reduces the effect of noise in the electronics and substantially eliminates the effect that slow drifts in electronics or optical efficiency or variation in the measured paper would otherwise have on the difference spectrum and hence the measurement of the fluorescent coefficient. It is seen from the above that the present invention provides an improved color sensor which can calculate the fluorescent coefficient, related to the effective FWA concentration of a sample without the use of moving filters and the like. Moreover, the color sensor can generate a spectrum which is corrected to show the spectrum of the sample as it would be if illuminated by a defined source such as a CIE source, or other lighting sources in which the excitation energy is known. Consequently, the color of a particular sample can be predicted for a variety of lighting conditions. It will, of course, be understood that modifications of the present invention, in its various aspects, will be apparent to those skilled in the art, some being apparent only after study, others being merely matters of routine electronic and mechanical design. For example, light detectors other than diodes may be utilized and other types of light sources may also be used. Other embodiments are also possible, with their specific designs dependent upon the particular application. As such, the scope of the invention should not be limited by the particular embodiment herein described, but should be defined only by the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
