## Description
SYNTHESIS OF BETA LACTAMS FIELD OF TUBE INVENTION This invention relates to a novel method of generating a wide spectrum of ss lactams particularly for medical uses. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION As a result of the eonstant need for new and more efficacious antibiotics, partly due to the appearance of strains of bacteria that are genetically resistant to many commonly used antibiotics, eonsiderable chemical research effort has been, and continues to be expended towards identifying novel naturally occurring antibiotics or developing synthetic methods of modifying them with the aim of creating drugs with enhanced antibiotic properties.Perhaps the class of antibiotics that has received the most attention in recent years is the 2 azetidinones, or as they are better known, ss lactams. B lactams are cyclic amides of B amindacids, and hence are essentially nitrogen analogs of cyclic lactones. No doubt the search for new B lactams is due to the fact that they are tolerated extremely well by humans, and that their molecular mechanism of action is known. ss lactams include penicillin, cephalosporin, and other widely used clinical antibiotics. The antibiotic activity of B lactams is due to their ability to inhibit the synthesis of bacterial cell walls.Knowledge of the molecular biology of this event has enabled investigators to devise rational chemical synthetic schemes aimed z at obtaining new f3 ss lactams, and over the years a number of synthetic schemes have yielded useful 8 lactams as described in Chemistry and Biology af B ss Lactam Antibiotics. Editors R. Morin and M. Gorman Academic Press, New York, 1982 . Recently considerable effort has focused on two subclasses of B ss lactams, specifically those that are unsubstituted at the 4 position of the 2 azetidinone s heterocyclic ring. These are the nocardicins and monobactams. The former exhibit p hydroxyphenylglycine and oxime functions, while the latter are 3 acylamino 2oxoazetidine l sulfonic acids. Both classes exhibit broad spectrum antibiotic activity.Moreover, the nocardicins are unique in that they are especially active againstEscherichia coli, Pseudomonas, and Proteus, while monobactams have the desirable feature of being resistant to ss lactamase, the bacterial enzyme responsible for hydrolyzing, and hence inactivating f3 lactams. The heretofor unsuspected broad therapeutic uses of 4 unsubstituted B ss lactams have generated research aimed at devising novel techniques for synthesizing 4 unsubstituted 6 lactams, in addition to the nocardicins and monobactams.But there has not heretofore existed a broadly general, practical method of synthesizing a wide variety of 4unsubstituted B lactams in medicinally useful quantities. Although there are a number of synthetic schemes for generating substituted B lactams, they are not applicable to synthesizing 4 unsubstituted ss lactams. Generally used methods of synthesizing substituted ss lactams are a the condensation of ketenes and imines b cyclization of amino acid derivatives via base catalysis c reaction of imines with acid chlorides in the presence of base and, d a Reformatsky type reaction with imines, essentially a reaction of ester enolates with imines.Part of the reason for the unavailability of a general method to make 4unsubstituted B lactams has been the unavailability of monomeric formaldehyde imines with the formulaEMI3.1 While monomeric formaldehyde imines are known to exist in the gas phase, in solution they rapidly trimerize to hexahydro 1,3,5 triazines with the formulaEMI3.2 Thus, the use of imines in ss lactam synthesis has been restricted to using stable aldimines with the formulaEMI3.3 as described by Gilman and Specter in the Journal the American Chemical Society, 1943, Vol. 65, p. 2255, and Gluchowski et al in the Journal af Organic Chemistry, 1980, Vol. 45, p. 3413.These reagents owe their stability to the presence of the Rl group which prevents trimerization, but at the same time bars unsubstitution at the 4 position of the B ss lactam ring since it is incorporated at that position. Because of the unavailability of techniques to generate monomeric formaldehyde imines, few 4 unsubstituted ss lactams are produced synthetically. Those that have been are generated either by tedious and complex chemical reactions which require removal of a group at the 4 position after formation of the 8 lactam, or by an acid catalyzed reaction that involves the use of hexahydrotriazines, that is, the trimerized product of formaldehyde imines. The latter method, as described by Kamiya et al in TetrahedronLetters, 1978, p. 5119, and more recently by Akeda et al, in the Chemistry Pharmacoloqy Bulletin, 1981, Vol. 29, p. 1747, is useful for generating nocardicins, but has not been used as a general means of generating other types of 4unsubstituted B lactams. It is clear in light of the need for novel antibiotics, and the fact that there currently does not exist a synthetic scheme for generating a wide variety of 4 unsubstituted lactams, that a method for producing these antibiotics would be a valuable tool of the medicinal chemist.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to this invention a simple one step method is provided which permits the synthesis of a diverse array of medically useful 4 unsubstituted 2 azetidinones premised on the An situ formation of monomeric formaldehyde imines from secondary N cyanomethyl or N aminomethyl amines, and reacting the formaldehyde imines with metal ester enolates to form the 4 unsubstituted 2 azetidinones. The method allows for the efficient production of both known and previously difficult to make antibiotics, and hithertofore unknown optically active 2 azetidinones.BRIEF DBSCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Table I.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF TEE INVENTION This invention was made with Government support underContract Grant No. GM 30859 awarded by the NationalInstitute of Health and Grant No. CHE 8203336 awarded by theNational Science Foundation. The Government has certain rights in this invention. General Procedure The general method of synthesizing 4 unsubstituted ss lactams is illustrated as follows. Two equivalents of a starting ester are allowed to react with any base capable of forming the metal ester enolate, particularly lithium hexamethyldisilazide LHMDS or lithium diisopropylamine LDA . The reaction is performed between 800C and OOC, the preferred temperature being 700C, and in an organic solvent particularly tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, dioxane, or dimethoxyethane. Next, a secondary N cyanomethyl amine orN aminomethyl amine, formed from primary amines by the commonly used methods of either Baker et al, as described in the Journal of the Chemical Society, 1949, p.307, or Okawara and Harada as described in the Journal Qf Organic Chemistry,Vol. 37, p. 3286, 1972, is added, at a temperature between 800C and 250C, the preferred temperature being 600C. This step results in the in aite generation of the corresponding formaldehyde imine as described by Overman and Burk in Tetrahedron Letters, Vol. 25, p. 1635, 1984, and the subsequent trapping of this intermediate by the metal ester enolate. The reaction mixture is then allowed to warm to 200C and room temperature and after several hours is extracted with an organic solvent, washed, dried and concentrated.Chromatography yields the 2 azetidinone. Using the reaction conditions described above, 3 aminosubstituted 4 unsubstituted ss lactams having a hydrogen substituent at C 3 of the ss lactam ring can be made from a metal ester enolate of a silyl protected glycine ester. The latter is formed by Djuric s method as described inTetrahedron Letters, 1981, Vol. 22, p. 1787, wherein the disilyl reagent 1, 1, 4, 4 tetramethyl 1,4dichlorodisilethylene is reacted with a glycine ester in dichloromethane in the presence of triethylamine.Chromatographic purification on silica gel results in cleavage of the silyl protecting group to give directly the 3 amino 2 azetidinone product. 3 N acylamino 4 unsubstituted lactams can be prepared similarly by employing metal dianions of N acyl alpha amino esters. Although a number of bases, as described by Bartlett and Barstow in the Journal nE OrganicChemistry, Vol. 47, p. 3933, 1982, can be employed for dianion generation, the preferred base is lithium hexamethyldisilazide. Nonracemic 4 unsubstituted ss lactams can be generated from N cyanomethyl amines derived from enantiomerically pure primary amines, and using the general reaction conditions described above. Reaction of a R cyanoamine with about 2 equivalents of a metal ester enolate yields the R , R ss lactam in better than 50 yields and high diastereoselectivity. ss lactams with the natural 3S configuration can be prepared similarly from S cyanoamines. The following examples, while exemplary of the present invention, should not be construed as specifically limiting the invention, and such variations which would be within the purview of one skilled in this art are to be considered to fall within the scope of this invention.
