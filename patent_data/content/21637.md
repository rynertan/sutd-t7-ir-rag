## Description
AMTflQTIITOL DERIVATIVES The present invention relates to novel amidothiol derivatives which are useful intermediates in the preparation of pharmaceutically active compounds, for example antibiotics, and have herbicidal and or antibacterial activity. The invention also relates to a novel process for the production of amidothiol derivatives by an electrochemical reaction of a disulphide and nitrile with an alkene. A number of known pharmaceutical active compounds, for example penicillin ie benzylpenicillin sodium and related antibiotics, contain a 1,3 thiazolidine ring or otherwise have nitrogen and sulphur in a vicinal relationship. The production or synthesis of such compounds would be facilitated by the ready availability of vicinal aminothiols. Moreover, the availability of such aminothiols would facilitate the production of new compounds having vicinal nitrogen and sulphur which would be expected to be pharmaceutically useful. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method of preparing aminothiols in a commercially viable manner It is also an object of the invention to provide compounds having herbicidal and or anti bacterial activity. According to a first aspect of the present invention, there are provided novel amidothiol derivatives of the following general Formula IEMI2.1 Formula I wherein R represents an alkyl, alk 2 to 6 enyl, phenylalkyl, phenyl or heterocyclic group optionally substituted by one or more functional groups inert to electrochemical oxidation R1, R2, R3 and R4 independently represent hydrogen or substituent groups of an alkene of the following general Formula IIEMI2.2 Formula II andR5 represents alkyl, phenylalkyl or phenyl. The alkene of Formula II from which the hydrogen or substituent groups R1, R2, R3 and R4 are derived can contain more than one double bond and in particular can be a diene or terpene.

The alkenyl groups represented by R can be straight or branched chain or cyclic alkenyl but must have the double bond in the 2 to 6 inclusive position relative to the free valency of the group.

The reduction or hydrolysis will be carried out in manner known per se for the reduction or hydrolysis of thioethers to mercaptans and of alkanoylamines to amines. The aminothiols of Formula III have herbicidal and or antibacterial activity. The compounds of Formula I can be prepared by a novel electrochemical process involving the oxidation of a corresponding organic disulphide in the presence of the corresponding alkene and the corresponding organic nitrile to provide a reaction product, believed to be a nitrilium compound, which is treated with water to yield the desired amidothiol derivative. The organic disulphide has the Formula RSSR in which R is as defined in connection with Formula I.The reaction proceeds more effectively with primary groups than with secondary groups and more effectively with secondary groups than with tertiary groups.Further in the case where R represents alkenyl, the reactivity of the disulphide decreases with the distance of the double bond from the free valency of the group. However, the reaction does not proceed with disulphides in which the double bond in in the l position. The disulphide should be electrochemically oxidised in preference to the alkene. However, the reaction could proceed with a substantial excess of disulphide in the event that the alkene is capable of oxidation under the reaction conditions employed. It is believed that the disulphide is electrochemically oxidized to form the cation RS which subsequently attacks the double bond of the alkene to form a carbonium ion. The alkene has the Formula II previously referred to. It will be apparent that the alkene should not have any alternative site which would preferentially react with the disulphide or the nitrile but can contain more than one double bond and in particular can be a diene or a terpene. The nitrile has the formula R5CN and is believed to react with the carbonium ion of the following general Formula 1V resultant from the attack of the cation RS on the alkene to form a nitrilium compound of the following general Formula V.EMI9.1 Formula 1VEMI9.2 tb SEP 1 SEP R tb RSC SEP C SEP N SEP SEP SEP C SEP R5 SEP tb SEP R SEP R SEP Formula SEP V tb SEP 2 SEP 4 tb Conveniently the nitrile is present in the reaction as a solvent or co solvent. The electrochemical reaction is carried out using suitable electrodes and an electrolyte. Preferably, platinium electrodes are used although other electrodes such as carbon electrodes can be used. The electrolyte will be one which is soluble in organic solvents and relatively highly ionised but must not discharge at the electrode. Suitable electrolytes include lithium perchlorate and tert n butyl ammonium fluoroborate. If the alkene is a gas, the reaction can be carried out in a closed vessel with the gas being circulated through the reaction mixture. In general terms conventional electrolysis techniques are employed. Vicinal amidothioethers are obtained from the addition product of the electrochemical reaction by the addition of water. Usually, water is added to the anolyte immediately after termination of the electrolysis. The amidothioether can then be separated from the aqueous phase by extraction with a suitable organic solvent such as diethyl ether. The product can be further purified by distillation, recrystallisation or chromatography. The invention is illustrated by the following non limiting Examples.EXAMPLE 1 2 Acetamido l methylthio cyclohexaneA mixture of dimethyldisulphide 96 mg in acetonitrile containing cyclohexene 405mg was placed in a conven tional H type electrolytic cell.
