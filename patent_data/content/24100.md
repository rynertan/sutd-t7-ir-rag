# TRANSMISSION

## Abstract
A transmission 10 has first, second and third motion transmitting members 12, 14, 16 which initiate driving direc tion, such as forward or reverse, control output speed and maintain differential operation of the transmission, respec tively. In space critical applications, such as small utility trac tors, for example, transmission size must be kept to a minimum to accommodate accessories and reduce overall tractor dimensions. In the transmission 10 , the third member 16 or differential is carried by a support member 36 , such as a shaft 66 , and drives output elements 24,26 connected to tractor axles. The second member 14 , controlling axle speed, is positioned about and longitudinally along an axis 40 of the support member 36 and drives the third member 16 . Driving direction is initiated by controlling rotational input through the first member 12 to drive the second member 14 . Thus, the transmission 10 is made compact by closely positioning the speed control and differential portions relative to one support member 36 , such as the shaft 66 , in the transmission 10 .
