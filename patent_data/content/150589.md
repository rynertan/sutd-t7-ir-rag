# Electric power steering system.

## Abstract
The torque gain of an electric motor 32 assisted power steering system is modified as a function of the estimated level of road load friction such that the relationship between the op erator exerted steering torque and the resulting rate of steer is substantially insensitive to a reduction in the level of road load. The road load is estimated as a function of the operator ex erted steering torque 42 , the torque assist provided by the electric motor, and the resulting steer rate 48 .
