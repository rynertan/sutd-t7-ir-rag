## Description
TITLEFINGERNAIL POLISH TYPE BOTTLETECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to bottles of the fingernail polish type, i.e. those for containing contents such as fingernail polish which are dispensed by repeatedly dipping an applicator, such as a brush, in the bottle.BACKGROUND ART Such bottles suffer from a disadvantage in that, while one hand is used to dip the brush in the bottle, the other hand is occupied in supporting the bottle. This can present difficulties, particularly in the context of fingernail polishing, in which the fingers of one hand are repeatedly required to support the bottle and then to be straightened so that nail polish can be applied. This is made more awkward by the presence of wet nail polish on this hand, or indeed both hands.DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION In accordance with the invention there is provided a bottle of the fingernail polish type, characterised by having a portion which is shaped to fit at least partially around a finger so that the finger can steady or support the bottle during use thereof. Using such a bottle with one finger steadying or supporting the bottle, the rest of the fingers can be extended for the application of nail polish. If the finger which is supporting or steadying the bottle is also extended, then no movement of this hand is required during the period in which polish is applied to all the nails of the fingers of that hand. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the bottle has a hole through which the finger extends during use. The finger can press down on the bottom surface of the hole to hold the bottle firmly on a support.Alternatively, if there is no support, such as a table, available, the finger itself can be used fully to support the bottle, so that the bottle can be used in circumstances which would otherwise not permit its use. However, the use of a hole is not essential. For example, the bottle may instead have at least one recess in which a finger can be fitted so that the surface of the recess fits partially around the finger, and preferably around a majority of the circumference of the finger. The or each recess preferably narrows at its mouth. The or each recess may face in any direction, for example outwardly or downwardly. The or each recess may be formed in the main body of the bottle or in a portion which is fixed to but outstanding from the main body. The finger engaging surface may be formed by an attachment fitted to the bottle, but is preferably formed by an integral part of the bottle. The bottle may have a cap provided with an applicator for dispensing the contents of the bottle.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Arrangements embodying the invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figures 1 and 2 each show a different bottle in accordance with the invention.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS The bottle 2 shown in Figure 1 contains fingernail polish, and has a cap 4 which has an internal, screwthreaded surface by means of which the cap can be fitted.on the externally screw threaded surface of the mouth 6 of the bottle 2. The cap 4 has a brush 8 fixed thereto and extending from its interior, the brush 8 being positioned inside the bottle 2 when the cap 4 is fitted to the bottle. The bottle 2 has a hole 10 at one side, through which the forefinger 12 of a user s hand extends.The hole 10 is formed in an integral part 13 of the bottle during manufacture of the bottle. It will be appreciated that the forefinger 12 can be used to support the bottle 2 while the brush 8 is repeatedly dipped in the bottle by the user s other hand. No movement of the forefinger 12, or the rest of the fingers on that hand, is required and these fingers can all be kept extended to make the application of the nail polish easier By virtue of the hole 10, the forefinger 12 can be used to hold the bottle 2 firmly own a supporting surface, or if the user wishes, the bottle 2 can be fully supported by the finger and in this case no supporting surface will be required. It is, of course, not necessary that the forefinger be used togsupport or steady the bottle any finger or thumb can be chosen according to which is most convenient. Another form of applicator, such as a dipstick which may for example be sponge tipped may be used in place of the brush. The bottle 2 is made of glass, although other materials, such as plastics,cold be used. Although the use oaf a hole is preferred, it is possible instead for the bottle to have a portion which merely partially surrounds a finger. An example of this is shown in Figure 2, in which a bottle 14 has at one side thereof a sideways facingC shaped recess 16. A finger indicated in chain dot lines can be fitted into this recess to steady the bottle.The recess 16 narrows at its mouth 18. The inner surface of the bottle is indicated in broken lines. The bottle of Figure 2 can be used to advantage in the same manner as that described with reference to the embodiment of Figure 1, and is somewhat easier to form from glass than is the bottle of Figure 1, although the bottle of Figure 2 could also be formed from plastics or other materials. The overall shape of the bottle could of course vary from those shown in Figures 1 and 2 for example, it could be spherical, cubical or pear shaped. The invention has been described in connection with a bottle of fingernail polish, but the bottle could instead contain other substances for application to fingernails, either for improving their appearance or maintaining their condition of health, such as a nail hardening substance. Further, the invention applies also to other bottles of the same general type, such as those containing typists correcting fluid. It will be appreciated that the invention provides a bottle which is easier to use than those of the prior art, which can be of advantage in a number of fields, and particularly when the user is disabled.
