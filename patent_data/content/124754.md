# Slack adjuster for a disc brake.

## Abstract
A slack adjuster is for a disc brake of the type which includes a disc mounted for rotation about an axle and a caliper brake having a housing 30 mounted on the axle in alignment with a friction surface of the disc. A braking piston 20 is mounted in the housing for axial movement toward and away from the friction surface of the disc. Brake actuation produces rotating movement of a powershaft 46 mounted in the housing 30 which will in turn produce a corresponding axial movement of the braking piston 20 through a non rotating powershaft nut 48 . An adjusting sleeve 56 is bet ween the piston 20 and the powershaft nut 48 and is threadably coupled to the piston 20 and capable of rotation relative thereto to adjust the axial position of the piston. The adjusting sleeve 56 is capable of rotating in a direction which will cause the piston 20 to be adjusted toward the disc and is prevented from rotating in the opposite direction by a one way clutch element 68 between the adjusting sleeve and the housing. A lost motion element 80 is between the power shaft 46 and the adjusting sleeve 56 and allows rotation of the powershaft 46 to produce corresponding rotation of the adjusting sleeve 56 after the piston 20 has moved toward the disc through a desired running clearance without having made any frictional contact therewith. The lost motion ele ment 80 employs a force limiting clutch element 94 to prevent corresponding rotation of the adjusting sleeve 56 after the piston 20 makes contact with the friction surface of the disc and when the powershaft 46 is rotated in a direction to produce movement of the piston away from the disc.
