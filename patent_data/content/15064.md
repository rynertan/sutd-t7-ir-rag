# Process for producing bipolar semiconductor device.

## Abstract
A process for manufacturing a bipolar semiconductor device is described. An epitaxial layer is formed on a silicon wafer, and a base layer is formed by the diffusion of impurities having one conductivity type in a part of the epitaxial layer. Impurities having the opposite conductivity type are deposited in a part of the base layer, polycrystalline silicon is deposited on the entire surface of the wafer which is provided with windows for emitter, base and collector electrodes, and a gold containing film is applied on the entire surface of the polycrystalline silicon layer. The deposited impurities having the opposite conductiv ity type are driven into the base layer so as to form an emitter layer and simultaneously gold atoms are driven in through the collector windows into a collector layer of the epitaxial layer and through the base and emitter windows into the collector layer. Thereafter, the emitter, base and collector layers are elec trically connected within the device.
