## Description
The present invention relates to amidine compounds having anti trypsin, anti plasmin, anti kallikrein, anti thrombin and anti complement activities. Compounds having anti trypsin, anti plasmin, anti kallikrein, anti thrombin and anti complement activities have already been known from British Patent No. 2,083,818 and from EP A 48433. The present compounds are stronger in enzyme inhibitory activities and anti complement activity, and more effective in oral administration than the above prior compounds. An object of the present invention is to provide pharmaceutically useful novel amidine compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof. Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for producing said novel amidine compounds. A still another object of the present invention is to provide anti trypsin, anti plasmin, anti kallikrein, anti thrombin and anti complement agents which may be administered orally. The present invention relates to novel amidine compounds of formula I The compounds I of the present invention can be produced by the reaction between a carboxylic acid compound of formula II or a reactive intermediate thereof and 6 amidino 2 naphthol of formula III or preferably an acid addition salt thereof. The process for producing the present compound is described below in detail. The present compound I can be prepared by dissolving or suspending a carboxylic acid compound II in an organic solvent such as dimethylformamide, pyridine, or the like, then allowing the compound II to react with a carboxylic acid activator such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide DCC , diphenylphosphoryl azide DPPA , or the like, which is usually used as dehydration condensation agent, and adding 6 amidino 2 naphthol III or preferably an acid addition salt thereof to the reaction product. For instance, when DCC is used as the dehydration condensation agent, a carboxylic acid derivative II is added to a solvent such as pyridine, then 6 amidino 2 naphthol III is added, and the mixture is stirred at a temperature between 30 and 80 C, preferably at room temperature, for 3 to 5 hours to complete the reaction, though it is not objectionable to continue the reaction overnight. Dicyclohexylurea DCU precipitates out of the reaction mixture, while the present compound I either precipitates with DCU or remains dissolved in the solvent. In the former case, both precipitates are collected by filtration, then suspended in a suitable solvent such as dimethylformamide or the like and the mixture is filtered to remove insoluble DCU. After adding to the filtrate a solvent such as ethyl ether, ethyl acetate, acetone or the like, the precipitate is collected by filtration to obtain the present compound I . Alternatively, the combined precipitate of DCU and the present compound I is collected by filtration, then added to a suitable solvent such as dimethylformamide, water or the like to remove insoluble DCU by filtration, the filtrate is added to a saturated aqueous sodium hydrogencarbonate solution to obtain the present compound I in the form of carbonate. In the latter case, where the present compound remains dissolved in the reaction mixture, DCU is removed by filtration and the filtrate is admixed with a solvent such as ethyl ether, acetone, ethyl acetate, or the like to obtain the present compound I . In another process, when it is intended to use an acid halide as a reactive intermediate of a carboxylic acid derivative II , the latter derivative II is allowed to react with an acid halogenation agent such as SOCl₂, SOBr₂, PC1₅ or the like to synthesize an acid halide represented by formula IV The compound III is replaced by the corresponding compound wherein an amidino group is protected, and the latter compound can be allowed to react with the compound II to obtain the compound I wherein the amidino group is protected. Splitting off an amidino protecting group by a usual manner can yield the present compound I . The amidino protecting group may be conventionally used ones. Examples thereof include a benzyloxycarbonyl or t butoxycarbonyl group. Examples of a method for splitting off an amidino protecting group include a reductive elimination by palladium carbon or an elimination by trifluoroacetic acid or HBr acetic acid. If necessary, acid addition salts of the present compound may be prepared in a customary manner. For instance, carbonate of the present compound is dissolved or suspended in a solvent such as methanol, DMF or the like and the carbonate is allowed to dissolve by the addition of an acid such as methanesulfonic acid, hydrochloric acid or the like. To the resulting solution is added a solvent such as ethyl ether, ethyl acetate or the like to obtain a corresponding acid addition salt. Acids which can be used are pharmaceutically acceptable ones including inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid and organic acids such as acetic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, methanesulfonic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid and maleic acid. The present compound and the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof possess powerful inhibitory activities against proteases, that is, trypsin, plasmin, kallikrein and thrombin and are effective as an anti trypsin agent for the treatment of pancreatitis, as an anti plasmin or anti kallikrein agent for hemorrhagic diseases, and as an anti thrombin agent for thrombus. The present compound is easily absorbable and hence is effective not only when injected but also when used orally or as a suppository. With respect to the above mentioned proteases, their roles in a living body, the relationship to the diseases, the clinical significance of these proteases inhibitors and the significance of the tests herein performed are explained below I. Trypsin Trypsin is a protease existing originally in the form of proenzyme trypsinogen in the pancreas and the proenzyme is secreted into the small intestine where it is transformed into trypsin by activation with enterokinase existing therein. Trypsin has a role as one of digestive enzymes. If the trypsinogen is activated by any chance in the pancreas to form trypsin, the pancreas tissue will be injured to manifest clinically the symptoms of pancreatitis. In fact, it is known that in an experiment using rat as test animal, when trypsin is injected conversely into the pancreas, the onset of intense pancreatitis is observed but the disease is cured by the administration of a trypsin inhibitor. From this fact, it is presumable that the present compound having a strong trypsin inhibitory activity is useful as an antitrypsin agent which is clinically effective for the treatment of pancreatitis. II. Plasmin Plasmin is an enzyme existing in the blood, usually in the form of proenzyme plasminogen which is converted to plasmin by the activation with a plasminogen tissue activator such as urokinase. This enzyme acts reversely to the action of thrombin, that is, it acts to dissolve fibrin. For this reason, plasmin plays an important role in securing blood flow through capillaries. However, when this enzyme becomes abnormally activated for some reason, it causes hemorrhagic diseases. This enzyme participates also in inflammation, increasing the vascular permeability and causing edema or the like. Therefore, an inhibitor for this enzyme is useful as a drug to treat hemorrhagic diseases and inflammation. III. Kallikrein Kallikrein is an enzyme widely distributed in blood and other organs and glands, usually in the form of its precursor prekallikrein which is activated by Hageman factor or other proteases. This enzyme participates in the hypotensive kallikrein kinin system which counteracts the hypertensive rein angiotensin system and plays an important role in the control of blood pressure. This enzyme participates also in exogenous coagulation system. Further, kallikrein originated from organs or glands plays an important role in the improvement of local circulation. However, an abnormal activation, particularly an abnormal local activation, of this enzyme causes an insufficiency of local circulation due to the exaggeration of coagulation system, causing inflammation, ulcer, of the like. Therefore, a kallikrein inhibitor is useful for the control of blood pressure and as a drug for the treatment of inflammation or ulcer. IV. Thrombin Thrombin is known as an enzyme having a blood coagulating activity. In normal state, thrombin is formed by the activation of prothrombin in the blood when the vascular wall is injured. Thrombin acts to decompose the fibrinogen in the blood into fibrin. The resulting fibrin deposits on the injured part of vascular wall to prevent plasma components from transudation and simultaneously to promote the restoration of tissues. However, when the coagulation system is abnormally activated for some reason, a large number of fine thrombi are formed in capillaries throughout the entire body. Therefore, the present compound is useful as a drug for the treatment of such a disease. The anti trypsin, anti plasmin, anti kallikrein and anti thrombin activities were determined according to the method of Muramatsu et al. M. Muramatsu, T. Onishi, S. Makino, Y. Hayashi and S. Fujii, J. of Biochem., The present compound and its pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts possess a strong Cl esterase Cl The role of complement in the living body, the interrelation between a disease and the complement, the clinical significance of inhibitor, and the significance of tests inhibition of Cl Anti complement activity 1 Cl The complement is one of the serum components and comprises 9 components of C1 to C9. C1 is separated into 3 subcomponents of Clq, Clr and Cls. Cl 2 Complement mediated hemolysis The complement mediated hemolysis is widely used as a means to determine the titration of complement. The principle of this method is based on the fact that hemolysis is caused by the activation of complement, when the latter is added to a complex immune complex of erythrocytes and the antibody thereof. The degree of hemolysis varies in proportion to the amount of complement added. Therefore, when a known amount of complement admixed with a Cl esterase inhibitor is used, the hemolysis must be suppressed in proportion to the inhibitory activity. The present compound having Cl esterase inhibitory activity showed strong inhibition of complement mediated hemolysis as shown in Table 2. 3 Forssman shock Quite different from other animals, guinea pig has on the surface of its organs a specific antigen called Forssman antigen which specifically reacts with the anti body of sheep erythrocyte. Forssman shock is based on the above principle and is a shock caused by the administration of antibody of sheep erythrocyte to a guinea pig. The Forssman shock was investigated in detail by many researches and it was definitely shown that this shock is a model case where the complement plays the principal part and that the shock is associated with a classical pathway in which the complement system is activated progressively starting from Cl. Since the participation of complement in autoimmune diseases has been established, the Forssman shock can be said to be useful means for testing a drug for autoimmune diseases. A drug effective for the treatment of Forssman shock is useful as a drug,of autoimmune diseases. The present compounds are effective for the treatment of Forssman shock by oral administration, as shown in Table 3.

Male Hartley guinea pigs of about 350 g in body weight were used. Each guinea pig of the control group was administered intravenously with hemolysin minimum dose to cause the shock commercial hemolysin, 5,000 U as assayed by the method of Ogata and the time elapsed until death was observed. Each guinea pig of the treated group was administered intravenously with hemolysin after the animal was administered orally with compounds 100 mg kg and the time elapsed until death was observed. The present compound is most suitably administered orally, though can be administered intrarectally or by injection. It is used as a drug either alone or in combination with other drugs. It is administered generally in the form of medicinal compositon, though can be administered as simple substance without any additive. Examples of medicinal composition include tablets, powders, capsules, syrups and solutions.
