# Stabilised lactase solutions and processes for stabilisation.

## Abstract
The invention is concerned with the use of sorbitol to stabilise aqueous solutions of yeast lactases. The sorbitol is conveniently used in high concentration so as to act not only as a stabilising agent but also as an antimicrobial agent. If desired, an antimicrobial agent other than sorbitol can be incorporated. Both aqueous solutions of yeast lastases containing sorbitol and processes for stabilising aqueous solutions of yeast lactases by incorporation of sorbitol are claimed.
