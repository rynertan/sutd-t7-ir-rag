# Melt processable anisotropic wholly aromatic polyester comprising 6 oxy 2 naphthoyl moieties, moulding compounds, moulded articles and films and fibres based thereon.

## Abstract
A polyester is provided which has been found to exhibit an optically anisotropic melt phase which enables it readily to undergo melt processing to form quality fibres, films, moulded articles, etc. The polyester of the present invention contains recurring 6 oxy 2 naphthoyl moieties in addition to moieties derived from at least one aromatic diol and at least one aromatic diacid in the proportions indicated. The hydrogen atoms present upon the aromatic rings of these moieties optionally may be at least partially substituted as described . The wholly aromatic polyester is capable of forming the desired anisotropic melt at a temperature below 400 C., and in a particularly preferred embodiment at a temperature below 320 C.
