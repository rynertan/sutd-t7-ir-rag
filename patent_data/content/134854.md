# Milk collecting system for automatic milk apparatus.

## Abstract
A collector member 23 for the vacuum hose lines 22 and pulsator lines 40 from the milking cups 20 of an automatic milking machine is provided which permits con nection of the vacuum hose lines 22 to a milk line 25 or milk pail such that milk never contacts any part of the collector member 23 itself. The collector 23 is advan tageously used in a system in which the vacuum hose lines 22 from the milking cups 20 are attached to a multi lumen milk hose 27 with each hose line 22 being connected to a respective lumen in the multi lumen milk hose 27 . The collector member 23 is sufficiently weighted so as to provide desirable tension to the teats of the animal being milked. The collector 23 provides a means for terminating the vacuum in the respective vacuum hose lines 22 when the milking cups 22 to which they are attached drop from the teat of the animal being milked. The vacuum terminating means comprises an elongate blunt element 30 positioned adjacent to the hose lines 22 as they emerge from the collector member 23 such that when a milking cup 20 falls from its respective teat on the animal being milked, the hose line 22 on the fallen milk cup 26 folds over the elongate blunt member 30 to close the hose line 22 . The collector 23 advantageously allows the use of vacuum hoses 22 made of silicone rubber.
