# A method for improving the weight gain and feed utilisation efficiency of pigs.

## Abstract
Pseudomonic acid and its salts and esters, may be used to promote growth of livestock, especially pigs. It is adminis tered orally in feedstuff or drinking water.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. A method for improving the weight gain and feed utilisation efficiency of livestock, which method comprises administering to livestock a growth promoting non toxic amount of pseudomonic acid or a salt or ester thereof. 2. A method according to claim 1 wherein pseudomonic acid or an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salt thereof is administered to livestock. 3. A method according to claim 2 wherein pseudomonic acid or the sodium salt thereof is administered to livestock. 4. A method according to claim 1 wherein an alkyl ester of pseudomonic acid is administered to livestock. 5. A method according to claim 4 wherein methyl pseudo monate is administered to livestock. 6. A method according to claim 1 wherein pseudomonic acid or a salt or ester thereof is administered in feedstuff. 7. A method according to claim 6 wherein the pseudomonic acid or salt or ester thereof comprises from 1 to 1000 ppm of the total feedstuff. 8. A method according to claim 7 wherein the pseudomonic acid or salt or ester thereof comprises from 2 to 200 ppm of the total feedstuff. 9. A method according to claim 8 wherein the pseudomonic acid or salt or ester thereof comprises up to 100 ppm of the total feedstuff. 10. A method according to claim 1 wherein the pseudomonic acid or salt or ester thereof is administered as a feedstuff premix in association with a conventional feedstuff premix carrier.

## Description
GROWTH PROMOTER The present invention relates to the use of pseudomonic acid, its salts and esters, as growth promoting agents for livestock. UK Patent No 1 395 907 discloses pseudomonic acid, of formulaEMI1.1 and salts and esters thereof. It has now been found that pseudomonic acid, its salts and esters, are surprisingly active as growth promoting agents for livestock, Particularly for pigs. Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for improving the weight gain and feed utilisation efficiency of livestock, which method comprises administering to livestock, a growth promoting, non toxic amount of pseudomonic acid or a salt or ester thereof. Preferred salts of pseudomonic acid are alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts, and preferred esters are alkyl esters. Preferably pseudomonic acid, sodium pseudomonate or methyl pseudomonate are used in the method of the present invention. Whilst pseudomonic acid, its salts and esters, may be administered to any livestock, they are particularly suitable for improving the weight gain and feed utilisation efficiency of pigs. Pseudomonic acid, its salts and esters, may be administered orally, preferably in the feedstuff or drinking water provided for the livestock. Conveniently, these are administered in the feedstuff at from 1 to 1000 ppm, more usually 2 to 200 ppm, suitably less than 100 ppm. For administration in feedstuff the drugs are conveniently formulated as a premix in association with a suitable carrier. Accordingly, in a second aspect, the present invention provides a veterinarily acceptable premix formulation comprising pseudomonic acid or a salt or ester thereof, in association with a veterinarily acceptable carrier. Suitable carriers are inert conventional agents such as powdered starch. Other conventional feedstuff premix carriers may also be employed. Pseudomonic acid, its salts and esters, may conveniently be produced by fermentation of Pseudomonas Fluorescens NCIB 10586 as disclosed in UK Patent No 1 395 907.Modifications of this process are described in US PatentNo 4 222 942 and European Patent Application No 0 005 614. For use in the present invention, pseudomonic acid, its salts and esters may be purified by techniques such as those described in the aforementioned patents, however, it may be uneconomic to undertake such purification and in this case either crude pseudomonic acid, or salts or esters thereof, may be employed, or the bacterial broth or solids thereof from fermentation of Pseudomonas Fluorescens NCIB 10586 may be used directly. The present invention will now be illustrated with reference to the following Examples, which are not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way.
