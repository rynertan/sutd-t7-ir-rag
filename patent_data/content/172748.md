# Control system for an infinitely variable transmission.

## Abstract
A control system for an infinitely variable belt drive transmission for an engine has a drive pulley 24 having a hydraulically shiftable disc 24a , a driven pulley 28 having a hydraulically shiftable disc 28a , a belt 26 engaged with both pulleys, and a hydraulic control circuit having a pump 36, 37 for supplying oil to shift the discs 24a, 28a . A transmission ratio control valve 44 is provided in the control circuit and responsive to engine speed for controlling the flow of oil to the disc 24a of the drive pulley for shifting the disc of the drive pulley to change to transmission ratio. A pressure regulator valve 43 is provided to respond to the transmission ratio for controlling the line pressure in the hydraulic circuit. An accumulator 60 is provided to supply the oil to the hydraulic cylinder 28b of the driven pulley 28 when the pressure in that cylinder decreased undesirably.
