# PROCESS FOR PREPARING MODIFIED ALLERGENS, THEIR USE IN TREATING ALLERGIC CONDITIONS

## Abstract
A process for preparing a modified allergen comprises protecting a substantial proportion of the allergenic sites, reacting the allergen so protected with a cross linking agent to give a linked product of substantially enhanced molecu lar weight distribution, and then deprotecting the linked product. The modified allergen produced by this process is useful in the treatment of allergic condition.
