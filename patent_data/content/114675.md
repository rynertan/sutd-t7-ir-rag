## Description
COLOR PHOTOGRAPHIC SILVER HALIDE LIGHT SENSITIVE MATERIAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a color photographic silver halide light sensitive material and, more particularly, to a color photographic silver halide light sensitive material for cameras which is improved in sharpness. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION With a recent spread of Size 110 cameras, it is desired that a smaller image plane, when enlarged, produces images of similar quality to those from a large image plane. For this purpose it is essential to provide a color photographic silver halide light sensitive material which has such superior granularity and sharpness that even if the magnification of enlargement is increased, the quality of the resulting print is not substantially degraded Various methods of increasing the sharpness of images are known. It is also well known that increasing the edge effect and decreasing light scattering in photographic light sensitive material are effective measures for increasing sharpness. The former method of increasing the edge effect utilizes a concentration gradient of an inhibiting substance during development. Typical examples of such inhibiting substances include iodide and bromide ions which are released when silver halide is developed in a developer, and oxidation products of developing agents. In addition, the compounds as described in, for example, U.S. Patents 3,227,554, 3,701,783, 3,615,506 and 3,617,291 are known to increase the edge effect positively. The DIR compounds and DIR couplers, as described in Japanese Patent Publication No.34933 80, are known as the most improved of the foregoing compounds. Even with these DIR couplers, however, it is not possible to increase the edge effect beyond a certain limit. The reason is that addition of large amounts ofDIR couplers to enhance the edge effect releases large amounts of inhibiting substances, inevitably resulting in a reduction in the maximum concentration and also a reduction in sensitivity. To overcome the problem as described above, it is necessary to increase the amount of, for example, silver being coated. This will increase light scattering due to silver halide and conversely lower an MTF curve in connection with the MTF curve, see Mees, The Theory of Photographic Process, 3rd Ed., Macmillan Co. , degrading the sharpness of not only a DIR coupler added layer, but also its underlying layer. In addition, this increase in the amount of silver coated undesirably increases production costs. The present invention is intended to develop novel DIR couplers which eliminate the above described disadvantages of conventional DIR couplers and which are capable of greatly increasing the edge effect while maintaining the degree of inhibition degree of reduction in the maximum concentration within a given range, and to provide a color photographic light sensitive material having improved sharpness in a low frequency region, as prepared using the novel DIR couplers. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION As a result of extensive investigations, it has been found that there is a certain relation between diffusibility of a development inhibiting substance and an MTF curve, and that a development inhibitor releasing coupler capable of releasing an inhibitor having a degree of diffusion ranging between 0.4 and 0.95 upon reaction with an oxidation product of a developing agent in the stage of development is useful for the purpose. Therefore, the present invention provides a color photographic silver halide light sensitive material characterized by containing a development inhibitorreleasing coupler capable of releasing an inhibitor having a degree of diffusion ranging between 0.4 and 0.95 on reacting with an oxidation product of a developing agent in the stage of development. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 shows C MTF curves and an O MTF curve as obtained when the degree of diffusion is changed as shown below while maintaining the degree of inhibition at the same level a . . . . 0.1, b .. .. 0.2, c .... 0.4, d ... 0.8 and Figure 2 shows a theoretical MTF curve as derived from the curves of Figure 1. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Simulation of the MTF curve when the diffusibility of the inhibiting substance is changed was performed as follows. A practical negative light sensitive material was exposed to soft X rays, developed, and measured by means of a micro densitometer to determine the shape of an edge formed. Various parameters for a diffusion equation were determined so that the shape of the edge could be reproduced by simulation. From this diffusion equation it is possible to determine a concentration distribution of an inhibiting substance. Further, from the thus obtained equation for the concentration distribution of an inhibiting substance, a chemical fog function was determined, and this function was transformed into a Fourier series whereby C MTF a as shown in Figure 1 was obtained. When the diffusion constant of the development inhibiting substance was raised from a to d , there were obtained curves C MTF a to C MTF d in which no light scattering occurred. As diffusibility is high, the C MTF value in a low space frequency region is high. Curve O MTF indicates an MTF curve in which the edge effect cannot be obtained at all, i.e., a certain amount of light scattering occurs.Since the practical MTF value is the product of an MTF value, MC u , on the C MTF curve and MO u on the O MTF curve, the theoretical MTF value when only the diffusibility of the development inhibiting substance is changed can be represented by Figure 2. From Figure 2 it can be seen that if the diffusibility of a releasing group of aDIR coupler is increased, the edge effect is increased and, in particular, MTF in a low space frequency region increases greatly. The degree of diffusion of a developmentinhibiting substance as used herein can be determined by the following method. A multilayer color light sensitive material is prepared by providing the layers as described hereinafter on a transparent support. This material is designated as Sample H. First Layer Red Sensitive Silver Halide Emulsion Layer A silver iodobromide emulsion silver iodide 5 molt mean size 0.4 p is provided with sensitivity by adding Sensitizing Dye I as used in Example 1 in an amount of 6x10 5 mol per mol of silver. A gelatin coating solution containing the above sensitized emulsion and Coupler C 2 in an amount of 0.0015 mol per mol of silver is coated so that the amount of silver coated is 2 1.8 g m film thickness 2 , whereby the red sensitive silver halide emulsion is prepared. Coupler C 2EMI6.1 Second Layer Gelatin Layer Containing polymethyl methacrylate particles diameter about 1.5 p of the silver iodobromide emulsion not having red sensitivity as used in the preparation of First Layer amount of silver coated 2 g m2 film thickness 1.5 . Each layer contains a gelatin hardener and a surfactant as well as the above described ingredients. A color light sensitive material is prepared which has the same structure as Sample H except that the silver iodobromide emulsion of Second Layer is not contained. This material is designated as Sample G. Samples G and H were each exposed to light through a wedge and, thereafter, processed in the same manner as in Example 1 except that the developing time is changed to 130 seconds. A development inhibitor is added to the developer till the density of Sample G drops to 1 2 of the original value. The degree of reduction in the density of Sample H at this time is used as a measure of diffusibility of the development inhibitor in the silver halide emulsion layer. The results are shown in Table 1. As can be seen from Table 1, the higher the degree of diffusion, the larger the amount of the inhibitor added must be in order to provide the same degree of inhibition. That is, it can be concluded that the diffusibility of a development inhibitor in a silver halide film is inversely proportional to its developmentinhibiting ability. Hence, when a development inhibitor of high diffusibility is used, the amount of the inhibitor being added must be increased since its degree of inhibition is low. In practice, however, if the degree of diffusion of the development inhibitor exceeds 0.95, the use of a DIR coupler containing the development inhibitor as a releasing group gives rise to the problem that the amount of the DIR coupler being added becomes very large, leading to an increase in the thickness of the emulsion film and a degradation of a high frequency component of MTF. As apparent from the Examples described hereinafter, it is only development inhibitors having a degree of diffusion ranging between 0.4 and 0.95 that can be recognized to increase the edge effect and substantially improve MTF. For example, in the case of a benzotriazole compound, if the degree of diffusion changes from 0.3 to 0.7, the MTF value increases from 1.05 to 1.21 seeSamples 101 and 103 as described hereinafter . Also with a mercaptotetrazole compound, if the degree of diffusion changes from 0.2 to 0.44, the MTF value increases from 1.03 to 1.10 see Samples 102 and 104 as described hereinafter . Thus, it can be understood that increasing the degree of diffusion is effective for increasing the edge effect. In summary, the higher the degree of diffusion of a DIR compound, the greater the edge effect of theDIR compound. However, the development inhibiting ability of the DIR compound decreases in inverse proportion to the degree of diffusion thereof and thus it is necessary to increase the amount of the DIR compound being added in order to obtain the same developmentinhibiting ability.

Typical examples of the couplers of the invention are given below.EMI23.1 EMI24.1 EMI25.1 EMI26.1 EMI27.1 EMI28.1 The DIR coupler of the invention is added in an amount of from 0.00001 to 0.5 mol, preferably from 0.001 to 0.05 mol, per mol of silver. This DIR coupler may be added to an emulsion layer, or intermediate layers such as an intermediate layer sandwiched between a high sensitive emulsion layer and a low sensitive emulsion layer having the same color sensitivity. The DIR coupler of the invention can be introduced in a silver halide emulsion layer by known techniaues such as the method as described in U.S. Patent 2,322,027. For example, the coupler is dissolved in alkyl phthalates e.g., dibutyl phthalate and dioctyl phthalate , phosphates e.g., diphenyl phosphate, triphenyl phosphate, tricresyl phosphate, and dioctylbutyl phosphate , citrates e.g., tributyl acetylcitrate benzoates e.g., octyl benzoate , alkylamides e.g., diethyllaurylamide , fatty acid esters e.g., dibutoxyethyl succinate and dioctyl acetate , trimesicates e.g., tributyl trimesicate , or organic solvents having a boiling point ranging between about 30 and 1500C, for example, lower alkyl acetates such as ethyl acetate and butyl acetate, sec butyl alcohol, ethyl propionate, methyl isobutyl ketone, ss ethoxyethyl acetate, and methyl Cellosolve acetate and, thereafter, dispersed in hydrophilic colloid. The above described high boiling and low boiling organic solvents may be used in combination with each other. In addition, it is possible to use the dispersion method using polymers as described inJapanese Patent Publication No. 39853 76 and JapanesePatent Application OPI No. 59943 76. If the DIR coupler contains an acid group, such as carboxylic acid or sulfonic acid, it is introduced in the hydrophilic colloid as an alkaline aqueous solution Gelatin is used advantageously as a binder or protective colloid for photographic emulsions. Other hydrophilic colloids can be used. For example, gelatin derivatives, graft polymers of gelatin with other polymers, proteins such as albumin and casein, cellulose derivatives such as hydroxyethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose and cellulose sulfate, sugar derivatives such as sodium alginate and starch derivatives, and various synthetic hydrophilic polymeric substances, homopolymers or copolymers, such as polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl alcohol hemiacetal, poly N vinyl pyrrolidone, polyacrylic acid, polymethacrylic acid, polyacrylamide, polyvinylimidazole and polyvinylpyrazole can be used. It is possible to use lime treated gelatin, acid treated gelatin and enzyme treated gelatin as described in Bull. Soc. Sci. Phot., Japan, No. 16, page 30 1966 . In addition, hydrolyzates and enzymedecomposition products of gelatin can be used. Examples of gelatin derivatives which can be used include compounds prepared by reacting gelatin with various compounds such as acid halides, acid anhydrides, isocyanates, bromoacetic acid, alkanesultones, vinylsulfonamides, maleinimide compounds, polyalkylene oxides and epoxy compounds. Typical examples are shown in, for example, U.S. Patents 2,614,928, 3,132,945, 3,186,846, 3,312,553, British Patents 861,414, 1,033,139, 1,005,784 and Japanese Patent Publication No. 26845 67. Graft polymers of gelatin which can be used include compounds prepared by grafting acrylic acid, methacrylic acid and their derivatives such as esters and amides, and homo or copolymers of vinyl based monomers, such as acrylonitrile and styrene, onto gelatin. In particular, graft polymers of gelatin and polymers having a certain extent of compatibility with gelatin, such as polymers of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, acrylamide, and hydroxyalkyl methacrylate, are preferred. These compounds are described in, for example,U.S. Patents 2,763,625, 2,831,767 and 2,956,884. Typical synthetic hydrophilic polymeric substances are the compounds described in, for example,West German Patent Application OLS No. 2,312,708, U.S.Patents 3,620,751, 3,879,205 and Japanese Patent Publication No. 7561 68. In the photographic emulsion layer of the photo graphic light sensitive material of the invention, the silver halide may be any of silver bromide, silver iodobromide, silver iodochlorobromide, silver chlorobromide and silver chloride. A preferred example is silver iodobromide containing 15 mol or less of silver iodide.Particularly preferred is silver iodobromide containing from 2 to 12 mol of silver iodide. Although the mean grain size of silver halide grains in the photographic emulsion is not critical, it is preferably not greater than 3 p. The mean grain size is determined based on projected areas with a grain diameter as the grain size in the case of spherical or nearly spherical grains, or an edge length as the grain size in the case of cubic grains. The grain size distribution may be narrow or broad. Silver halide grains in the photographic emulsion may be in a regular crystal form, e.g., cubic or octahedral, or in an irregular crystal form, e.g., spherical or plate like, or in a composite crystal form thereof. Furthermore, they may be a mixture of grains having various crystal forms. Silver halide grains may be composed of an inner portion and a skin layer, having different phases, or may be composed of a uniform phase. Furthermore, they may be grains in which a latent image is formed mainly on the surface thereof, or grains in which a latent image is formed mainly in the interior thereof. Photographic emulsions as used herein can be prepared by the methods as described in, for example,P. Glafkides, Chime et Physique Photographiaue, PaulMontel 1967 , G.F. Duffin, Photographic EmulsionChemistry, The Focal Press Co. 1966 , and V.L. Zelikman et al., Making and Coating Photographic Emulsions, TheFocal Press Co. 1964 . That is, any of an acid process, a neutral process, an ammonia process, and so forth can be employed, and soluble silver salts and soluble halides can be reacted in any suitable manner, such as by a single jet process, a double jet process, and a combination thereof. A method, so called reverse mixing method, in which grains are formed in the presence of excess of silver ions can be employed. As one embodiment of the double jet process, a so called controlled double jet process in which the pAg of a liquid layer where silver halide is formed is kept constant can also be employed.This method produces a silver halide emulsion in which the crystal form is regular and the grain size is nearly uniform. Two or more silver halide emulsions which are prepared separately can be used in admixture with each other. The formation or physical ripening of silver halide grains may be performed in the presence of cadmium salts, zinc salts, lead salts, thallium salts, iridium salts or its complex salts, rhodium salts or its complex salts, iron salts or its complex salts, and so forth. For the removal of soluble salts from the emulsion after the formation of precipitate or physical ripening, a noodle water washing method in which gelatin is gelled may be used, or a flocculation method utilizing inorganic salts, anionic surfactants, anioni polymers e.g., polystyrenesulfonic acid , or gelatin derivatives e.g., acylated gelatin and carbamoylated gelatin may be used. The silver halide emulsion is usually subjected to chemical sensitization. For this chemical sensitization, for example, the methods as described in H. Frieser ed., Die Grundlagen der Photographischen Prozesse mit Silberhalogeniden, Akademische Verlagsgesellschaft 1968 , pages 675 734 can be employed. That is, a sulfur sensitization method using sulfur containing compounds capable of reacting with activated gelatin and silver e.g., thiosulfates, thioureas, mercapto compounds and rhodanines , a reduction sensitization method using reducible substances e.g., stannous salts, amines, hydrazine derivatives, formamidinesulfinic acid, and silane compounds , a noble metal sensitization method using noble metal compounds e.g., complex salts of gold, and the metals of Group VIII of the Periodic Table, such as platinum, iridium and palladium , and so forth can be used singly or in combination with each other. The sulfur sensitization method is described in detail in, for example1 U.S. Patents 1,574,944, 2,410,689, 2,278,947, 2,728,668 and 3,656,955 the reduction sensitization method, in, for example, U.S.Patents 2,983,609, 2,419,974 and 4,054,458 and the noble metal sensitization method, in, for example, U.S.Patents 2,399,083, 2,448,060, and British Patent 618,061. Various compounds can be incorporated in the photographic emulsion as used herein for the purpose of preventing fog during the process of production, storage or photographic processing of light sensitive material, or of stabilizing its photographic performance. For this purpose can be used a number of compounds known as antifoggants or stabilizers, such as azoles, e.g., benzothiazolium salts, nitroindazoles, triazoles, benzotriazoles, and benzimidazoles particularly nitro or halogen substituted products heterocyclic mercapto compounds, e.g., mercaptothiazoles, mercaptobenzothiazoles, mercaptobenzimidazoles, mercaptothiadiazoles, mercaptotetrazoles particularly l shenyl 5 mercapto tetrazole , and mercaptopyrimidines the above described heterocyclic mercapto compounds further containing a water soluble group such as a carboxyl group or a sulfone group thioketo compounds, e.g., oxazolinethione azaindenes, e.g., tetraazaindenes particularly 4 hydroxy substituted 1,3,3a,7 tetraazaindenes benzenethiosulfonic acids and benzenesulfinic acid. For more detailed examples and methods of using them, U.S. Patents 3,954,474, 3,982,947, 4,021,248 and Japanese Patent Publication No. 28660 77 can be referred to. The photographic emulsion layer or other hydrophilic colloid layers of the light sensitive material of the invention may contain therein various surfactants as coating aids or for various purposes of, e.g., preventing charging, improving sliding properties and emulsification dispersion, preventing adhesion or improving photographic characteristics such as acceleration of development, high contrast and sensitization . For example, nonionic surfactants such as saponin steroid base , alkylene oxide derivatives e.g., polyethylene glycol, a polyethylene glycol polypropylene glycol mixture, polyethylene glycol alkyl ethers or polyethylene glycol alkylaryl ethers, polyethylene glycol esters, polyalkylene glycol sorbitan esters, polyalkylene glycol alkylamines or aides, and a silicone polyethylene oxide adduct , glycidol derivatives e.g., alkenylsuccinic acid polyglyceride and alkylphenol polyalyceride , fatty acid esters of polyhydric alcohols, and alkyl esters of saccharides anionic surfactants containing acid groups, such as a carboxyl group, a sulfo group, a phospho group, a sulfate group, and a phosphate group, e.g., alkyl carboxylates, alkyl sulfonates, alkylbenzenesulfonates, alkylnaphthalenesulfonates, alkylsulfates, alkyl phosphates, N acyl N alkyltaurines, sulfosuccinates, sulfoalkylpolyoxyethylene alkylphenyl ethers, and polyoxyethylene alkyl phosphates amphoteric surfactants such as amino acids, aminoalkylsulfonic acids, alkylbetaines, and amine oxides and cationic surfactants such as aliphatic or aromatic quaternary ammonium salts, heterocyclic quaternary ammonium salts e.g., pyridinium and imidazolium , and aliphatic or heterocyclic phosphonium or sulfonium salts can be used. The photographic emulsion layer of the photographic light sensitive material of the invention may contain polyalkylene oxide or its derivatives, such as ethers, esters and amines, thioether compounds, thiomorpholines, quaternary ammonium salt compounds, urethane derivatives, urea derivatives, imidazoles, 3 pyrazolidones, and so forth for the purpose of increasing sensitivity or contrast, or accelerating development. For example, the compounds as described inU.S. Patents 2,400,532, 2,423,549, 2,716,062, 3,617,280, 3,772,021, 3,808,003 and British Patent 1,488,991 can be used. The photographic light sensitive material of the invention may contain dispersions of water insoluble or water sparingly soluble synthetic polymers in the photographic emulsion layer or other hydrophilic colloid layers thereof for the purpose of, e.g., improving dimensional stability. Examples of such synthetic polymers include homo or copolymers of monomers such as alkyl acrylate or methacrylate, alkoxyalkyl acrylate or methacrylate, glycidyl acrylate or methacrylate, acrylamide or methacrylamide, vinyl esters e.g., vinyl acetate , acrylonitrile, olefins, and styrene, and copolymers of the foregoing monomers and monomers such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, a, unsaturated dicarboxylic acid, hydroxyalkyl acrylate or methacrylate, sulfoalkyl acrylate or methacrylate, and styrenesulfonic acid. For example, the compounds described in U.S.Patents 2,376,005, 2,739,137, 2,853,457, 3,062,674, 3,488,708, 3,525,620, 3,607,290, 3,635,715, 3,645,740,British Patents 1,186,699 and 1,307,373 can be used. In photographic processing of the lightsensitive material of the invention, any of the known methods and known processing solutions as described in, for example, Research Disclosure, No. 176, pages 28 30 RD 17643 can be used. Alternatively, if desired, a color photographic processing to form a color image may be applied. The processing temperature is usually chosen within the range of from 18 to 500C, although lower temperatures than 180C or higher temperatures than 500C may be employed. As a special developing system, there may be employed a method in which a developing agent is incorporated in a light sensitive material, for example, in its emulsion layer, and the light sensitive material is developed by treating it in an alkaline aqueous solution.Of these developing agents, hydrophobic ones can be incorporated in the emulsion layer by various techniques such as the methods as described in Research Disclosure,No. 169 RD 16928 , U.S. Patent 2,739,890, BritishPatent 813,253, and West German Patent 1,547,763. Such a developing treatment may be performed in combination with a silver salt stabilizing treatment using thiocyanates. Fixers having the formulations that are commonly used can be used in the present invention. As fixing agents, as well as thiosulfates and thiocyanates, organosulfur compounds which are known to have a fixing effect can be used. These fixers may contain a water soluble aluminum salt as a hardener. Dye images can be formed by the usual method such as a negative positive process which is described in, for example, Journal of the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers, Vol. 61 1953 , pages 667 701 . A color developer is generally an alkaline aqueous solution containing a color developing agent.As color developing agents, the known primary aromatic amine developing agents, such as phenylenediamines e.g., 4 amino N,N diethylaniline, 3 methyl 4 amino N ,Ndiethylaniline, 4 amino N ethyl N ss hydroxyethylaniline, 3 methyl 4 amino N etnyl N S hydroxyethylaniline, 3 methyl 4 amino N etnyl N ss methanesulfonamiaoethyl aniline, and 4 amino 3 methyl N ethyl N ss methoxyethyl aniline , can be used. In addition, the compounds as described in L.F.A. Mason, Photographic Processing Cherristry, Focal Press Co. 1966 , pages 226 229, U.S. Patents 2,193,015, 2,592,364 and Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 64933 73 may be used. The color developer may further contain pH buffers, development inhibitors, antifoggants, and so forth. In addition, if necessary, hard water softening agents, preservatives, organic solvents, development accelerators, dye forming couplers, competitive couplers, foggants, auxiliary developing agents, tackifiers, polycarboxylic acid based chelating agents, and anti oxldants may be incorporated. Typical examples of such additives are descried in, for example, Research Disclosure, RD 17643 , U.S.Patent 4,083,723, and West German Patent Application OLS No. 2,622,950. After color development, the photographic emulsion layer is usually bleached. This bleaching treatment may be performed separately from or simultaneously with the fixing treatment. Bleaching agents which can be used include the compounds of polyvalent metals such as iron III , cobalt III , chromium IV and copper II , peracids, quinones, and nitroso compounds. For example, ferricyanides dichromates organic complex salts of iron III or cobalt III , such as complex salts of organic acids such as aminopolycarboxylic acids e.g., ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, nitrilotriacetic acid, and 1,3 diamino 2 propanoltetraacetic acid , citric acid, tartaric acid, and malic acid persulfates permanganates and nitrosophenol can be used. Of these compounds, potassium ferricyanide, sodium iron III ethylenediaminetetraacetate, and ammonium iron III ethylenediaminetetraacetate are especially useful. The ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid iron III complex salt is useful in both the independent bleaching solution and the combined bleaching and fixing solution. To the bleach or bleach fixing solution can be added various additives as well as the bleach accelerators described in, for example, U.S. Patents 3,042,520, 3,241,966, Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 8506 70 and 8836 70, and the thiol compounds described in JapanesePatent Application OPI No. 65732 78. The photographic emulsion as used herein may be subjected to spectral sensitization using methine dyes, etc. Useful sensitizing dyes are the compounds as described in, for example, German Patent 929,080, U.S.Patents 2,493,748, 2,503,776, 2,519,001, 2,912,329, 3,656,959, 3,672,897, 4,025,349, British Patent 1,242,588 and Japanese Patent Publication No. 14030 69. These sensitizing dyes may be used in the usual manner, but may be used in combination with each other. Combinations of sensitizing dyes are often used particularly for the purpose of color sensitization.Typical examples are described in U.S. Patents 2,688,545, 2,977,229, 3,397,060, 3,522,052, 3,527,641, 3,617,293, 3,628,964, 3,666,480, 3,672,898, 3,679,428, 3,814,609, 4,026,707, British Patent 1,344,281, Japanese PatentPublication Nos. 4936 68, 12375 78, Japanese PatentApplication OPI Nos. 110618 77 and 109925 77. The present invention includes a multilayer multicolor photographic light sensitive material comprising a support and at least two layers having different spectral sensitivities. This multilayer natural color photographic light sensitive material usually bears at least one red sensitive emulsion layer, at least one multicolor sensitive emulsion layer, and at least one blue sensitive emulsion layer on the support. The order of these layers is not critical, but can be determined appropriately. It is usual for the red sensitive emulsion layer to contain a cyan forming coupler, for the greensensitive emulsion layer to contain a magenta forming coupler, and for the blue sensitive emulsion layer to contain a yellow formino coupler. In some cases, however, different combinations are employed. An exposure time ranging between 1 1,000 and 1 second which is usually used for cameras can be, of course, employed in the present invention. In addition, an exposure of shorter than 1 1,000 second, and an exposure of from 1 104 to 1 106 second using a xenon flash lamp or a cathode ray tube can be applied.Furthermore, an exposure of longer than 1 second can be applied. If necessary, the spectral composition of light for use in the process of exposure can be control led by means of a color filter. In the process of exposure, laser light can be used. Furthermore, the light sensitive material of the invention may be exposed to light emitted from fluorescent substances excited by electron rays, X rays, y rays, a rays, and so forth. A color forming coupler, i.e., a compound capable of forming color through oxidative coupling with aromatic primary amine developers e.g., phenylenediamine derivatives and aminophenol derivatives in the color developing processing may be used in combination with polymer coupler latexes in the photographic emulsion layer of the light sensitive material of the invention, or may be used singly in a layer where a polymer coupler latex is not used. Typical examples of magenta couplers which can be used include a 5 pyrazolone coupler, a pyrazolobenzimidazole coupler, a cyanoacetylcoumarone coupler, and a closed acylacetonitrile coupler typical examples of yellow couplers which can be used include an acylacetamide coupler e.g., benzoylacetanilines and pivaloylacetanilides and typical examples of cyan couplers which can be used include a naphthol coupler and a phenol coupler. These couplers are preferably non diffusing ones containing a hydrophobic group called a ballast group in the molecule thereof. The couplers may be either 4 equivalent or 2 equivalent relative to silver ion. Colored couplers having the effect of color correction or so called DIR couplers releasing a development inhibitor as development proceeds can also be used.In addition to these DIR couplers, colorless DIR coupling compounds producing a colorless coupling reaction product and releasing a development inhibitor can be used. Typical examples of the magenta couplers are described in, for example, U.S. Patents 2,600,788, 2,983,608, 3,062,653, 3,127,269, 3,311,476, 3,419,391, 3,519,429, 3,558,319, 3,582,322, 3,615,506, 3,834,908, 3,891,445, West German Patent 1,810,464, West GermanPatent Application OLS Nos. 2,408,665, 2,417,945, 2,418,959, 2,424,467, Japanese Patent Publication No. 6031 65, Japanese Patent Application OPI Nos. 20826 76, 58922 77, 129538 74, 74027 74, 159336 75, 42121 77, 74028 74, 60233 75, 26541 76, and 55122 78.

Typical examples of the DIR couplers are described in, for example, U.S. Patents 3,227,554, 3,617,291, 3,701,783, 3,790,384, 3,632,345, West GermanPatent Application OLS Nos. 2,414,006, 2,454,301, 2,454,329, British Patent 953,454, Japanese Patent Application OPI Nos. 69624 77, 12335 74, and Japanese PatentPublication No. 16141 76. In addition to DIR couplers, compounds capable of releasing a development inhibitor with development may be incorporated in the light sensitive material.Compounds which can be used include the ones described in, for example, U.S. Patents 3,297,445, 3,379,529, WestGerman Patent Application OLS No. 2,417,914, JapanesePatent Application OPI Nos. 15271 77 and 9116 78.

For example, the polymers described in British Patent 685,475, U.S. Patents 2,675,316, 2,839,401, 2,882,156, 3,048,487, 3,184,309, 3,445,231, West German PatentApplication OLS No. 1,914,362, Japanese Patent Application OPI Nos. 47624 75 and 71332 75 can be used. The light sensitive material of the invention may contain, as anti color foggants, hydroquinone derivatives, aminophenol derivatives, gallic acid derivatives, and ascorbic acid derivatives. The light sensitive material of the invention may contain ultraviolet absorbers in the hydrophilic colloid layer thereof. For example, aryl groupsubstituted benzotriazole, 4 thiazolidone, benzophenone, cinnamate, butadiene, and benzoxazole compounds, and further ultraviolet ray absorbing polymers can be used.These ultraviolet absorbers may be fixed in the hydrophilic colloid layer. Typical examples of the ultraviolet absorbers are described in, for example, U.S. Patents 3,533,794, 3,314,794, 3,352,681, Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 2784 71, U.S. Patents 3,705,805, 3,707,375, 4,045,229, 3,700,455, 3,499,762, and West German Patent ApplicationLaid Open No. 1,547,863.

To each layer, as well as the ingredients as described below, a gelatin hardener and a surfactant were added. This light sensitive material is designated asSample 101. The compounds as used in the preparation of the light sensitive material were as follows Sensitizing Dye I Anhydro 5,5 dichloro 3,3 di y sulfopropyl 9 ethyl thiacarbo cyanine hydroxide pyridinium saltSensitizing Dye II Anhydro 9 ethyl 3,3 di y sulfo propyl 4,5,4 ,5 dibenzothia carbocyanine hydroxide triethyl amine saltSensitizing Dye III Anhydro 9 ethyl 5,5 dichloro 3,3 di gamma sulfopropyl oxacarbo cyanine sodium saltSensitizing Dye IV Anhydro 5,6,5 ,6 tetrachloro 1,1 diethyl 3,3 di ss ss gamma sulfopropoxy ethoxy ethylimidazolo carbocyanine hydroxide sodium saltSensitizing Dye V Anhydro 6,6 dichloro 5 cyano 1,1 diethyl 5 trifluoromethyl 3 p sulfophenethyl 3 4 sulfo butyl benzimidazolocarbocyanine hydroxide potassium salt EMI55.1 n m m l. m m l l by weight molecular weight about 40,000EMI55.2 EMI56.1 EMI57.1 EMI58.1 A series of light sensitive materials, Samples 102 to 107, were prepared in the same manner as in the preparation of Sample 101 except that the type and amount of Coupler D in the Sixth Layer were changed as shown in Table 1. In addition, light sensitive materials,Samples 108 and 109, were prepared in the same manner as in the preparation of Samples 101 and 103 except thatSensitizing Dye IV of the Sixth and Seventh Layers was replaced by Sensitizing Dye V. Each light sensitive material was exposed to white light through a pattern for determination of MTF and then was subjected to the developing processing as described below. The light sensitive material was also exposed wedgewise to white light, and its sensitivity and gradation were determined. The developing processing was performed at 380C as follows 1. Color Development 3.25 minutes 2. Bleaching 6.5 minutes 3. Rinsing 3.25 minutes 4. Fixing 6.5 minutes 5. Rinsing 3.25 minutes 6. Stabilization 3.25 minutes The composition of the processing solution as used at each step was as follows Color Developer Sodium Nitrilotriacetate 1.0 g Sodium Sulfite 4.0 g Sodium Carbonate 30.0 g Potassium Bromide 1.4 g Hydroxylamine Sulfate 2.4 g 4 N Ethyl N ss hydroxyethylamino AS g 2 methylaniline Sulfate Water to make 1 literBleaching Solution Ammonium Bromide 160.0 g Ammonia Water 28 25.0 m Sodium Iron Ethylenediaminetetraacetate 130 g Glacial Acetic Acid 14 m Water to make 1 literFixer Sodium Tetrapolyphosphate 2.0 g Sodium Sulfite 4.0 g Ammonium Thiosulfate 70 175.0 m Sodium Hydrogensulfite 4.6 g Water to make 1 literStabilizing Solution Formalin 8.0 m Water to make 1 liter For the thus processed materials, MTF of the magenta color image was measured, and MTF at a space frequency of 5 cycle mm is shown in Table 2. Also, the density of the cyan color image at a point where the exposure amount was larger by 0.5 ag a logarithmic value than that at a fog density of 0.2 was measured, and the results are also shown in Table 2. This point is referred to as a point of log Fez0.5. It can be seen that if the DIR couplers of the invention are used, the MTF of the green sensitive emulsion layer is greatly increased and the development inhibitor released diffuses eVsn in the red sensitive emulsion layer, as a result of which the color formation of the red sensitive emulsion layer is prevented that is, the so called interlayer effect is greatly increased.Thus, the DIR compounds of the invention greatly contribute to an increase in color reproductivity.

Thus, it can be seen that as the degree of diffusion increases, the MTF value increases. When the degree of diffusion is 0.44, the MTF value is 1.10 which is beyond an MTF value at which an improvement in sharpness can be observed with the eye.This clearly demonstrates the effect of the invention. Samples 108 and 109 produced the same results as did Samples 101 and 103. While the invention has been described in detail and with reference to specific embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.
