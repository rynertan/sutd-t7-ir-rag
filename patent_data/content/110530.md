# MIXER FOR MIXING FIBRES INTO A SLURRY

## Abstract
A mixer for mixing glass fibres into a relatively dilute aqueous cement slurry, e.g. for use in forming glass fibre reinforced cement products on an asbestoscement making machine of the Hatschek or Bell type, comprises an annular chamber 10 with a tangential slurry inlet 14 , a helical ris ing floor 21 , a coaxial conical outlet 15 disposed to re ceive slurry flowing over the inner wall 12 which is lower than the outer wall 11 , and a fibre inlet 16 above the con ical outlet 15 so that the fibres are mixed with the slurry as it passes down the wall of the conical outlet 15 in a vortex motion.
