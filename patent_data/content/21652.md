# Linear aromatic polyesters, their preparation and shaped articles thereof.

## Abstract
Linear aromatic polyesters comprising monomer residues of a bisphenol and a dicarboxylic acid which posses enhanced hydrolytic stability are provided having terminal carboxylate ester groups derived from an aliphatic monofunctional alcohol of 8 to 45 carbons e.g. stearyl alcohol. Low molecular weight polyesters of the invention have improved stability on processing. The terminal carboxylate groups can be introduced by reaction with a diacyl halide reactant such as is employed in conventional polycondensation reactions, or by reaction with a diaryl ester reactant such as is employed in conventional transesterification polymerisation reactions.
