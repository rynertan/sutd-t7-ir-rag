# RECOVERY PROCESS OF URANIUM

## Abstract
A recovery process of uranium is described compris ing 1 extracting uranium ions with an organic solvent containing one or more compounds selected from the group consisting of alkyl phosphoric acids, alkyl aryl phosphoric acids, alkyl dithio phosphoric acids, aryl dithio phosphoric acids, neutral phosphoric acid esters and alkyl amines together with a petroleum hydrocarbon as diluent and 2 stripping or extracting the uranium ions from the resultant organic solution of step 1 into an aqueous phase by contact with an aqueous solution containing one or more compounds selected from the group of NH₄F, NH₄HF₂, KF or KHF₂.
