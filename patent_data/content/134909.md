# Styrene butadiene block copolymer.

## Abstract
A styrene butadiene block copolymer having a Mooney viscosity ML₁ ₄, 100 C of from 10 to 150 comprises at least two specific types of random styrene butadiene copolymer blocks or one such copolymer block and one butadiene homopolymer block , the blocks differing in their bound styrene content and in the vinyl content of the butadiene portion. The total vinyl content of the whole bound buta diene is from 30 to 70 and the total bound styrene content is from 10 to 40 by weight. This block copolymer has excellent wet skid resistance and rolling resistance. It also has well balanced fracture and wear characteristics as well as satisfactory processability and cold flow properties.
