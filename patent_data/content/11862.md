## Description
NON CONTACT TEMPERATURE SENSOR FOR A FUSING ROLLER This invention relates, in general, to heated fusing roller apparatus for affixing toner material to a substrate to form permanent images thereon and, more particularly, to means for sensing changes in temperature of the heated roller very closely in order to develop control signals for maintaining substantially constant the surface temperature of the heated roller at an area where it contacts the toner material. In the process of electrostatic or magnetic printing, information is typically recorded in the form of a latent electrostatic or magnetic image on a recording member with subsequent rendering of the latent image visible by the application of electrostatic and or magnetic marking particles, commonly referred to as toner. The visual image can be either fixed directly upon the recording member or transferred from the member to a sheet of plain paper with subsequent affixing of the image thereto. In order to permanently affix or fuse a toner material onto a record medium, such as paper, it is necessary to elevate the temperature of the toner material to a point at which the constituents of the toner material coalesce and become adhesive. This action causes the toner to be absorbed to some extent into the fibers of the record medium.Pressure is sometimes used to increase the adhesion.Thereafter, a the toner material is cooled, soliifiction of the toner material occurs causing the toner material to be firrrly bonded to twe record meelzm. In both the electrostatic and magnetic printing arts, the use of thermal energy for fixing toner images onto a support member is old and well known. One approach to thermal fusing of toner images onto a record medium has been to pass the record medium with the toner images thereon between a pair of opposed rollers, at least one of which is either externally or internally heated.In thi5 type of arrangement, the toner image contacts the surface of the heated roller member in the nip between rollers to thereby produce heating of the toner image within the nip. In apparatus utilizing a fuser roll pair as described above, it is important that the heated roller surface be maintained within a suitable range to properly fuse the toner image to its record medium. A conventional manner for accomplishing the foregoing is by the employment of a temperature sensitive resistance device commonly referred to as a thermistor which is placed in physical contact with the heated roll and whose output controls the heat source.An improved arrangement for controlling the heat source is described in a copending U.S. Patent application entitled Temperature Controller For a Fusing Roller Serial No. 965,880 filed December 4, 1978 and assigned to ffi zom√≥n assignee. There is wear to thermistor and fuser roller surface at the contact point. Slidiny contact produces fri zionai temperature rise which is dependent upon condition cf sliding interface amount of non stick oil applied, contamination of interface with toner material, age and condition of roller surface, etc. . Snce this temperature rise is unstable, the set point accuracy is similarly degraded. Non contact thermistors suffer from slow response due to long thermal lag between changes in roller surface temperature and corresponding changes in thermistor temperature resulting in large over and undershoots during transient conditions. Difficult to uncouple changes in ambient temperature from thermistor. Spacing variations between thermistor and roller surface produce large changes in set point making long term stability difficult and requires recalibration when the roller is replaced. Thermographic phosphors exhibit instability of UV source degrades the stability of the temperature controller, which is highly undesirable.Since this is an optical system, it is also subject to degradation by stray toner on roller surface or sensor apparatus. infrared sensing requires apparatus for chopping the infrared beam to achieve stability. This approach is also affected by ambient temperature and must be compensated. Gain varies according to emissivity of surface being monitored. All these are undesirables. Other solutions tc the problem have been envisioned but they have resulted in more expensive or mcre complicated devices than was desired. According to the present invention, the problems of noncontact sensing of the fusing roll temperature in a magnetic printer by trite provision of a non contact curie point sensor and control therefor for maintaining the temperature of the fuser roller substantially constant in an area where it contacts toner material. More specifically, the present invention utilizes a sensor for measuring the permeability of a curie point material which in one embodiment of the invention is formed integrally with the surface of the fuser roller. Since the permeability of the curie pclnt material can be correlated to the temperature thereof, which In turn is a function of the surface temperature of the roller, the surface temperature can be accurately measured and used for controller the power input to the fuse roller for the purpose of maintening the temperature thereof, substantally constant. Where the curie point material 3 an integral part of the fcser roller it r. be uniformly dispersed throughout the surface of the fuser roller or may constitute a continuous stripe about the circumference of the roller. The invention is described in greater detail in the following description of the preferred embodiment of the invention when read in cor.,junction with the accompanying drawings wherein FIGURE 1 is a pictorial view of a toner sealing mechanism for an automatic electrostatic or magnetic printing apparatus utilizing the present invention FIGURE 2 illustrates graphically certain features useful in explaining the present invention FIGURE 3 is a schematic, partly ifl section, of a curie point temperature sensing system incorporated in the apparatus of FIGURE 1 FIGURE 4 is a block diagram of a roller temperature control used in conjunction with thefuser apparatus illustrated in FIGURE 1 FIGURE 5 is waveforms illustrating certain aspects of the operation of the present invention FIGURE 6 illustrates in greater detail certain blocks illustrated in FIGURE 4 FIGURE 7 illustrates the power waveforms generated in accordance with the present invention and FIGURE 8 illustrates the details of the line current sensing system shown in FIGURE 4. Referring now to r uCRr i, there is shown an embcdn.ent of the subject invention as applied in a magnetic printing system wherein latent magnetic images are produced on a magnetic medium such as an endless belt of magnetic tape and the latent magnetic images are developed with toner particles which are then transferred to a record medium such as paper. In a printer application the latent images would be descriptive of, for e m e, alpha and ns ri. informa tion available from a keyboard or from a communication line.In order te provide a permanent record, it is desirable that the toner developed images transferred to the record medium are permanently fused to that record medium. In this connection shown in FIGURE 1, 2 pair of rollers 1 and 2 are provided. The two rollers driven by an external source such as a motor, not shown, cooperate with one another to form a nip therebetween through which a substrate such as paper, supporting toner material, is moved. As shown in FIGURE , roller 1 is heated by a resistance heater 3 such as a quartz lamp. In the embodiment shown, the heater derives electrical energy from source 4 under the control of a controller 5 which shall be described in greater detail shortly.The surface temperature of roller 1 must be maintained within a very narrow range of the order of 200F 100C typically centered at 3300F 1650C to render the toner particles adhesive enough to cling to the paper but nct hot enough to melt them to a liquid which would leave a residue clinging to the roller and affecting subsequent paper passing between the rollers. To achieve this, therefore, the electrical energy supplied to resistance heater 3 has to be controlled very closely. In order to achieve this degree of control, it is necessary to measure or monitor the temperature of the surface of roller 1 very accurately. In order to monitor the surface temperature of roller 1, applicant inserts a ferromagnetic material as a band 6 completely surrounding the roller.The composition of the material is selected to have a curie temperature range which corresponds to range of temperature to be maintained. Referring to FIGURE 2, there is shown a characteristic curve for curie point material operating in the embodiment of the present invention. In FIGURE 2 the magnetic relative permeability which is a dimensionless number is plotted as the ordinate and the temperature of the material is plotted as the abscissa. As shown, the permeability of the material is in the order of 1000 for all temperatures starting from room temperature 700F 200C up to some point near a control point where the permeability of the material drops rapidly through a range which includes the temperature control range.As previously mentioned in a particular embodiment, this temperature control range was of the order of 200F 100C centered on 3300F 1650C . While the invention has been described in connection with a particular temperature control range in mind, it is obvious that this range can be changed depending on the application desired. FIGURE 2, therefore, illustrates that it is desired to control the temperature of the roller 1 within the narrow temperature range of 200F 100C . To achieve this, applicant makes use of an alternating magnetic field bridge having the curie material included in one arm of said bridge.As shown in FIGURE 1 the magnetic bridge is energized by an oscillator driver 8 which in a particular application provided 3 kilohertz signals ts the brdga. h output of the bridge representative of the permeability of the material as it charges with temperature , and hence the representative of the surface temperature of roller 1, constitutes an input signal to controller 5 for controlling the amount of electrical energy being supplied by source 4 to the heater 3 to maintain the temperature of the surface of the roller within the desired limits. Referring to FIGURE 3, the nature of the magnetic bridge is shown in greater detail with tne roller 1 shown in cross section. Roller 1 comprises an aluminum cylindrical core coated with a thin, elastomeric, non stick coating.Bridge 7 in a particular embodiment comprises an E core of ferromagnetic material in which the reference winding energizes one arm of the bridge from signals applied from oscillator 10 via amplifier 11. The opposite arm of the bridge is energized from the source 10 through a variable gain inverting amplifier 13. Inverting amplifier 13 is such that the windings 9 and 12 are energized with 3 kilohertz signals which are 1800 out of phase. The gain of the variable gain amplifier 13 is adjusted such that the bridge passes through null at the center of the temperature or permeability control range.One of the arms of the bridge includes the roller 1 without the ferrite material, that is containing in a particular embodiment only aluminum which exhibits an essentially constant permeability with temperature change and the other arm includes the portion of the roller 1 carrying the ferrite material 6 embedded in a surface which has a permeability which varies with the temperature of the surface of the roller. The magnetic fields established between the arms cf the bridge and the fuser roller are illustrated for one particular instant by the arrows.Since the ferromagnetic material was selected to have its steepest permeability changes in the range of the temperature control range, the bridge produces signals on its output leads 14 which essentially represents the temperature of the roller in the desired control range. The signals developed on the output leads 14 are of 3 kilohertz value and having a phase which varies with respect to the phase of the signals from source 10 available on leads 15 in accordance with the change in permeability of the ferrite material 6 and hence of the temperature of the surface of the roller 1. Controller 5 in FIGURE 1 responds to the relative phase of the signals available on 14 from the bridge and 15 from the reference source 10 to control the electrical energy available from source 4 to the heater 3. The controller to be described shortly performs several complex functions necessary to maintain the surface temperature of the roller within the prescribed temperature range while at the same time minimizing the adverse impact on the power source 4 as a result of the characteristics of the heater element 3.For example, in a particular embodiment the heater element was a quartz lamp which had a maximum power consumption of 2000 watts when provided with power from 120 volts 60 hertz source. With this power, the lamp can raise the surface temperature of the fuser roller 1 to a level which will soften the toner and cause proper adhesion of the toner to the record medium or paper. It should be noted that in a high speed printer application a considerable amount of heat energy has to be supplied to the fuse roller since the heat energy is being carried away rapidly by the paper moving therethrough. In a particular application where the paper moved at about 16 inches 40cm per second, high power quartz lamp was required and this lamp had to be operated near its maximum limit.When such a high power lamp is initially energized, a current surge develops, typically six times normal heating current due to the large positive temperature coefficient of resistance of the lamp filament. In a usual application this amount of surge current would open the fuses or require an oversized power source. To minimize this surge current, it is necessary to allow the filament to warm up slowly by applying widely spaced individual cycles of the current thereto. Also since the typical lamp current is near the source limit, a current detector is included to delete cycles to limit the full power current as it approaches an acceptable maximum.Random switching this large amount of power in an application such as involving a printer connected to normal AC service would produce high frequency noise or DC components in the power line circuit which would exceed acceptable limits. To overcome these problems, applicant provides an arrangement to control the applied power as integral cycles rather than applying fractional cycles of line frequency current.Power is therefore controlled in full integral cycle increments. This involves switching at the zero crossings of the line voltage. In order to avoid multiple cycle surges during the cycle switching, the arrangement to be described distributes the power cycles evenly in time as the proportion of cycles blocked to cycles passed is varied in accord ance with the energy requirements of the fuser roller 1. Referring to FIGZ i, a phase comparator.16 responds to the difference in phase between the signals available on leads 14 and i5 to produce an output signal on lead 17 indicative of the difference in phase between the applied input signals. In a particular embodiment the signals on leads 14 and 15 were 3 kilohertz sine waves. These 3 kilohertz input signals are first prepared by amplification and limiting to prqduce ganare waves which are combined in an exclusive OR gate as. digital pulses.When these processed pulses are in the same state, the output of comparator 16 is at a logic 0 state and if they are not in the same state, then they produce a second state output signal which is at a logic 1.This circuit is a well known circuit and for further details reverence should be made to the RCA solid state handbook entitled COS fOS Integrated Circuits dated 1977 wherein an exclusive OR network operating as a phase comparator is described on paae 612. The outPut of comparator 16 is level 1 or level 0 signals for various amounts of time depending upon the relative phases of the signals available on leads 14 and 15. The purpose of circuit 18 is to convert the variable dutv cvcle Dulse train available on lead 17 to a DC signal bv low pass filtering The DC signal. therefore, on lead 19 is indicative of the temPerature of the surface of the fuser roller 1.The function of block 20 is to convert the analog signal on 19 to a digital signal in form of a binary code representing the quantized value of the DC signal available on lead 19. Essentially, circuit 20 senses five dis re DC levels and cea 2 b na J e3d ca lead 21.The A to D converter 20 is a common circuit and will not be described in detail. Preference can be made to Texas Instruments integrated circuit zL48q. Reference can be made no to FIGURE 5 wharein the output of the A to D converter in the form of a five bit code is shown. The converter has six possible output states which span the range of analog signals available on lead 19. The 0 state represents the upper limit of the temperature control range shown in FIGURE 2 and the state 5 represents the lower limit of the temperature control range.The prc ortlon selector 22 functions to delete the desired integral number of power cycles being supplied from the power source 4 to the resistance heater 3 through a current detector 23 and solid state relay 24. As previously mentioned, the function of the selector 22 is to control solid state relay 24 so that it only supplies full or integral cycles of power and that the cycles passed are uniformly distributed in time. Referring to FIGURE 6 the further details of the selector 22 are shown. Essentially, this involves a four bit counter 25 which counts the clock pulses available from source 26 and develops a binary number representative of the sequential counting from 1 to 16 on the leads 27 applied to gates 28. The inputs to leads 27 are representative of the counted line cycles.The particlar line cycles selected for passage to heater 3 are communicated to lead 29 in accordance with the states of the signals available on leads 21 from the A to D converter 20. Referring to FIGURE 5 again therefore, it is seen that for the 0 state no integral or full cycles of the 16 counted cycles is passed to the output lead 31. For the first state only the first cycle is passed. For the second state only the first and ninth cycles are passed and so forth. For the fourth state alternate cycles are passed and for the fifth state the power is passed continuously for all cycles, Fli flop 32 assures that only one on off decision can be made per cycle. Flipflop 32 is a standard D type flip flop. This decision is conveyed by a signal developed on lead 31 for coupling to solid state relay 24.These variations in duty cycle rePresents the various amounts of average power to be delivered from source 4 to the resistance heater 3 to maintain the temperature of the roller 1 within the desired range under varying load conditions. Referring to FIGURE 7, the manner in which the solid state relay 24 responds to the control signal available on lead 31 to gate the desired integral cycles from the power source 4 to the resistance heater 3. This is shown for the condition of A D state 4 appearing on leads 21. Thus, applicant has described an arrangement for either applying or deleting integral full cycles of power from the source to control the heating of the roller while uniformly distributing the power line cycles so that they produce the previously mentioned advantages. It is desirable to monitor the average line current from source 4 to the resistance heater 3 and to delete cycle to r.duca axcessiva current consumption during full power, or state 5, caused by high line voltage condi tins or by an unusually low resistance of the heater 3 which would otherwise cause the heater circuit to draw excessive current and open the fuse. The over current detector 23 operates to cause the proportion selector 22 to delete alternate cycles state 4 of FIGURE 5 to reduce the current consumption during the period these undesirable conditions exist.In a particular application the current detector 23 comprises a current sensor, is transfrmer 32 as shown in FIGURE 8 which responds to the current flowing in the AC line from power source 4 to resistance heater 3. Current produced by sensor 32 is rectified in full wave detector 33 and filtered in low pass filter 34 to produce a signal corresponding to the average magnitude of lamp current. When tunis signal at tne output of the low pass filter 34 is above a predetermined level inaicating excessive current, a level detector 35 responds to produce a signal over lead 36 to the OR gate 37 of the proportion selector 22 t change the state 5 signals appearing on leads 30 to a state 4. This state 4 represents the ap lication of alternate integral cycles of power from source 4 to the resistance heater. This condition is continued until the average current from the low pass filter 34 fals below the predetermined level which indicates that the adverse conditions have passed. The solid state relay 24 is a common device available usually as a triac switching element with an internal triggering circuit to accomplish switching at the zero crossing points of the applied voltage following changes in the control signal. While the invention has been described with particular reference to the construction shown in the drawings, it is understood that further modification may be made without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention
