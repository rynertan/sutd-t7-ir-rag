# Fuel injection pump for diesel engines.

## Abstract
A fuel injection pump for diesel engines, in which the pressure chamber of each cylinder 10 is defined on its side opposite the piston 16 by a slide valve 38 movable in a direction opposite the piston against the action of resilient biasing means 52 . The slide valve is sensitive to the supply pressure of the fuel and controls communication between the pressure chamber and the fuel delivery passage 44, 46 . The slide valve allows the initial alteration of the effective delivery, and hence the effective injection advance, in dependence on the running conditions load of the engine.
