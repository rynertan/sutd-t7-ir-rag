## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF METHANE RICH GASES, AREGENERATED NICKEL CATALYST USEFUL THEREFOR AND PROCESS FOR PREPARING IT. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe invention relates to a process for the production of methane rich gases by the conversion of a mixture comprising hydrocarbons, steam and optionally methanol or methanol and optionally steam by using nickel catalysts on a thermally stable oxidic carrier. The invention also relates to a regenerated nickel catalyst useful for such process, a process for preparing such catalyst and the use thereof for the process for the production of methane rich gases. Processes of this type have been developed by the British Gas Corp. and its predecessors the GasCouncil, the North Western Gas Board and later by Heinrich Koppers GmbH, LURGI Netallgesellschaft AG, and JapanGasoline Corp. Catalysts for these processes have been developed amongst others by ICI Ltd., BASF and NikkiChemical Company.All theses processes, most of them described in patent specifications DE B 1545463 US A 4182926 4140493 GB A 1437957 US A 3420642 DE B 1227603 GB A 1265481 1443277 have two things in common 1. Mixtures of hydrocarbons are converted with steam in a temperature range between 350 and 550 C and at pressures roughly between 0.5 and 2.5 MPa into a gas mixture containing mostly methane and also hydrogen and carbon dioxide and small quantities of carbon monoxide. 2. Catalysts for these processes are mostly based on nickel as the active component.For an conomically favourable utilisation of the process it would be attractive to keep the steam addition to the hydrocarbon feed at the level that is minimally required to stay outside the carbon deposition area. Furthermore, it would be desirable to have a great flexibility in the hydrocarbon feedstock composition. It is well known, however, that variations in the feedstock composition and near thermodynamic steam to hydrocarbon ratios when operating the process, will give problems because of catalyst deactivation, carbon deposition and consequently an increased pressure drop over the reactor with incomplete conversion of the hydrocarbon feed, The properties of the catalyst greatly influence the behaviour of the process when pushing its operating towards the thermodynamic limits for carbon deposition.Thus, a great deal of work has been devoted to the search of good catalysts for this process.Also, process operating procedures can improve the overall performance either as such or as a consequence of the improved properties of the catalyst. In the many publications on this subject it is explained that the reaction comprises several steps, the most important of which are a first step in which the hydrocarbons decompose onto the nickel surface releasing hydrogen into the gas phase while carbon rich intermediates are left on the catalyst surface, this reaction is endothermic and a second step in which the carbon rich species react with steam to form methane, this reaction is exothermic. The first reaction causes carbonacious material to be formed on the catalyst at the entrance of the catalyst bed. As a consequence there is a temperature drop in this part of the catalyst bed and also a progressive deactivation.By an increased steam addition and by an increased entrance temperature the reaction between steam and carbonacious deposits can be promoted leading to a retardation of catalyst deactiviation. Obviously, this will reduce the efficiency of the process. Furthermore, because of the consequently larger gas throughput, the reactor volume must be increased to maintain a certain space velocity. Therefore, many efforts in catalyst research were directed towards enhancing the reaction between steam and carbonacious deposits.A number of nickel catalysts may be used, examples of which can be found in DE B l 199 427 and 1 227 603.BE A 634 920 describes catalysts which are suitable for reforming hydrocarbons with steam and contain nickel or cobalt in the form of the metal or in the form of a compound which may be reduced to form the metal as well as a metal of the platinum group upon a refractory support such as alumina. These catalysts may also contain a small amount of an alkali metal or an earth alkali metal in order to prevent the deposition of carbon upon the catalyst.It is also known from said Belgian patent specification 634 920 that by carrying out the reforming point of hydrocarbons having a boiling point of at most 350 C with steam at a temperature of 600 1000 C synthesis gas or a gas having a low methane content are obtained but that by carrying out said processes at a temperature of 450 700 C a methane rich gas is obtained.According to ER B l 394 202 the life of the catalysts in the process as described inDE B l 180 481 can considerably be increased by recycling hot reaction gases containing water gapour through the catalyst bed, mixed with the hydrocarbon vapour and steam being supplied to said bed.US A 4 140 493 describes a nickel catalyst it calcium phosphate support and barium or uranium as a promotor. According to Canadian patent 848 888 the addition of alkali metals to nickel catalysts enables the utllisatior of heavier hydrocarbon feedstocks.A more recent development in this field is described in US A 4 216 123. There the problem is solved by influencing the occurrence of the endothermal and exothermal reactions as a function of the displacement along the catalyst bed in the reactor. The catalyst is characterized by the fact that it consists of a group VIII metal from the periodic system with alumina and optionally minor amounts of alcali or alcaline earth metals with a very specific pore size distribution.This specific pore size distribution invokes a split up to the consecutive reactions in the process so as to give a good balance between the endothermal and exothermal process steps. Although this process has very favourable properties it also has some disadvantages. The most important is that by virtue of the conversion mechanism the overall conversion is limited by diffusion of higher hydrocarbons into the pores which makes the catalyst relatively low active.This can only be overcome by using large catalyst volumes and consequently large reactor sizes which is obviously not economically attractive. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention is aimed at mainly 4 objectives.1. Finding a catalyst which will convert hydrocarbon steam mixtures at near carbon deposition boundary conditions into a methane rich gas without substantial deactivation. 2. Finding a catalyst which will convert hydrocarbon feedstocks with considerable variation in composition, 3. Finding a catalyst which is already active at relative low temperature in promoting the above reactions.4. Finding a catalyst which can be reactivated and which can be used in reactivated form after it lost its original activity.Furthermore, finding a catalyst that allows a large temperature difference over the catalyst bed would be advantageous.In the process according to the state of the art, the temperature difference over the catalyst bed is mostly limited to below 80 because of catalyst requirements. This is effectuated by the addition of excess steam with obviously the same disadvantages as mentioned before. The conversion of methanol into a methane rich gas proceeds roughly according to the reaction 4 CH3OH 3 3 0114 2H20 C02Thus, theoretically, no steam has to be added for the catalytic conversion of methanol.In US A 4 282 926 the conversion of methanol over a cobalt molybdate catalyst at temperatures of between 2000 a and 4550 C is described. The conversion of methanol over nickel containing catalysts, is described in i F A 23 41 288.In order to reduce carbon deposition, methane recycle and steam addition to the reaction feed are proposed. These measures bring the reaction feed mixture outside the carbon deposition limits which results in a considerable reduction of catalyst deactivation. An obvious disadvantage, however, is a considerable reduction in the overall thermal process efficiency.In addition to the above mentioned aims of the invention, it is an aim of our invention to use the same catalyst for the conversion of methanol to a methane rich gas.It has been found that the above mentioned objects of the invention can be accomplished in a process for the production of methane rich gases by the conversion of a mixture comprising hydrocarbons, steam, and optionally methanol or methanol and optionally steam by using nickel catalysts on a thermally stable oxidic carrier, characterized in that the metallic nickel particles are chemically bonded to the thermally stable oxidic carrier. As thermally stable oxidic carriers there can be used according to the invention the compounds, which according to the state of the art are used as carriers for catalysts in many fields.Such carriers have a large specific surface area Non restrictive examples for such carriers are alumina, silica, magnesia, silica alumina, silica magnesia, zirconia, silica zirconia, titania, silica zirconia tltania, crystalline or amorphous alumino silicate molecular sieves and metal phosphates. According to the invention zirconia and NgO, but especially Al2O3 and SiO are preferred. 2The element or elements, the oxides of which are used as carriers according to the invention e.g.aluminium or silicon, are dened hereinafter for the sake of simplicity as carrier base element or elements.If silica is used as a carrier, commercially available products may be used, such as Aerosil registered trade mark . Other carriers may also be used in the form of their commercially available products.According to a preferred embodiment of the invention the chemical bond between the metallic nickel particles and the oxidic carrier is provided by an interfacial layer different from the oxidic carrier, which layer consists of a compound containing oxygen and at least one member selected from the group consisting of nickel and the carrier base element or elements. Generally the interfacial layer consists of a a compound containing nickel ions, or b a stable non stoichiometric oxide of the carrier base element or elements, or c a compound containing nickel and the carrier base element or elements.If the carrier is an oxide of a carrier base element or elements, which form s only stoichio metric oxides, the interfacial layer contains nickel ions. If, on the other hand, the carrier is an oxide of a carrier base element or elements, which can form a stable non stoichiometric oxide, the interfacial layer comprises such nonstoichiometric oxides and may in addition comprise nickel ions.As carrier base element or elements which iorm s only stoichiometric oxides, preferably at least one member of the group consisting of Si, Al andMg is used. The interfacial layer is very thin and usually has a thickness between 0.2 and 10 nm, preferably between 0.5 and 5 nm. In fact this interfacial layer has a thickness of only a few atoms s It t is extreme ly important that essentially all of the metallic nickel particles of the catalyst are chemically bonded to the carrier as described in the above. The metallic nickel particles of the active catalyst do not form a continuous layer, but are individual particles which are chemically bonded to the carrier. It has been observed that, if the active catalyst contains appreciable amounts of metallic nickel particles which are not chemically bonded to the carrier, these particles will give rise to the formation of carbon. Therefore, it is preferred that in the catalyst used in the process of the invention per cm3 of the catalyst bed there is not more than 0.05 gs preferably not more than 0.03 g and most preferably not more than 0.01 g metallic nickel, which is not chemically bonded to the carrier, e.g. through the interfacial layer. Preferably the nickel particles size distribution in the catalyst used in the process of the invention is such that less than lO by volume of the particles is smaller than 2 nm and less than 10 by volume of the particles is larger than 30 nm. Nickel is mostly precipitated on the oxidic carriers in the form of hydroxide or oxide. The hydroxide or oxide is not, however, catalytically active for the above reactions, so that it has to be reduced to nickel metal. The most obvious way of effecting a chemical bond would be partial reduction of the nickel hydroxide or nickel oxide primarily fuzed on the carrier. The nickel particle thus formed is chemically bonded by the remaining nickel oxide, which in turn is bonded by the carrier.There is a problem, however, in that the reduction of a nickel oxide particle, once started, tends to proceed fast until the particle is fully reduced to nickel metal. Part of the nickel ions should be supplied in a form which is reducible more slowly than the pure oxide. To achieve this purpose the nickel ions could be reacted with the carrier into a compound, which is less readily reduced or alternatively a carrier could be used, which can be partially reduced. In the latter case reduction of the carrier material produces metal atoms, often alloyed with nickel, which strongly interact with both the nickel and the carrier. Reaction of at least part of the nickel ions with the carrier material to form a compound which is less readily reduced than the nickel hydroxide or nickel oxide, can be achieved with SiO2 as a carrier. For instance, a suspension of SiO2 in a solution of nickel salt could be taken, to which an alkaline compound is added in excess over the dissolved temperature if needed, before filtering and drying the loaded carrier, the SiO2 carrier reacts to some extent into nickel hydrosilicate.The portion of the SiO2 reacting into hydrosilicate varies with the reactivity of the SiO2 used and with the excess of alkaline compound used.A more complete reaction of SiO2 into hydrosilicate is obtained by coprecipitation of nickel and SiO2, as described by Van Eijck, Van Voorthuisen and Sranzen In Rec. Trav. Chim. LO 1951 p. 793.According to this method a solution of water glass is thoroughly mixed with a solution of nickel salt, resulting in a more or less complete reaction to form nickel hydrosillcate. Generally the nickel hydrosilicate crystallizes into relatively large, plate shaped crystallites. Reduction of the coprecipitated material produces nickel particles which adherevery well to the remaining SiO2, which still contains nickel ions. Catalysts prepared according to this method are suitable for the process of the invention.Referring in more general terms to the methods of preparation of the nickel catalysts useful in the process of the invention it has been found that these nickel catalysts are obtainable by one of the following methods, which are given by way of example only. These methods comprise a mixing an aqueous solution of a nickel salt an an aqueous solution of a salt of the base element and raising the pR value up to a level where the dissolved nickel and base element or elements ions have been precipitated, aging, if required, the precipitate in the solution, and if required hydrothermally treating the solid, drying, calcinating and reducing or b mixing a solution of a nickel salt and a solution of a salt of the base element or elements, the oxide of which is the thermally stable oxidic carrier, in an aqueous medium with an aqueous solution of an oxalate or formate, separating, drying, calcinating and.reducing the precipitate or c suspending in finely divided form the thermally stable oxidic carrier in a dilute solution of a nickelt salt and precipitating a nickel compound at elevated temperature if required and with vigorous agitation by injection of hydroxyl ions below the level of the vigorously agitated suspension or by forming hydroxile ions by a chemical reaction, which is known per se, of compounds contained also in the solution in an amount of l to 10 times the amount stoichiometrically required, followed by separating, drying, calcinating and reducing the loaded carrier or d introducing into the suspension of the thermally stable oxidic carrier a nickel salt solution under the surface of the suspension and keeping the pE value of the suspension between 4 and 7, separating, drying, calcinating and reducing the loaded carrier.To obtain a catalyst of sufficient large activity per unit volume a nickel loading of at least 5 by weight based on the total weight of a catalyst is desirable.The method referred to under c hereinabove is known as such from DE G 17 67 202. In this way highly suitable catalysts can be obtained. It has also been stated in DE o l7 67 202 that nickel catalysts thus prepared can be used for methanation of the small quantities of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide which are present in the gas for the synthesis of ammonia. This relates to the methanation of tiny quantities of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide about 0.1 by vo. present in a hydrogen nitrogen mixture.Since d Al203 carriers form chemical bondings with Ni at the surface of the carrier only at relatively high temperatures, two methods are particularly suitable to obtain chemically bonded Ni on oL Al203 as a carrier. 1. Homogeneous precipatation of NiOOH onto alumina by disproportionation of cyanate at e temperature below 600 C, subsequent separation and drying of the precipitate, and calcination at a temperature between 85G and 9500 C, and subsequent reduction at about 4500 C.2. Preparation of the precipitate of l by homogeneous precipitation using urea, under the condition that the starting solution of Ni2 , in which alpha Al2O3 is dispersed, has a pli below 3. The filtered precipitate is further treated as in l . In the process according to the invention there are used in the feed mixture hydrocarbons of 2 to 16 C atoms per molecule.The temperature of the feed mixture at the beginning of the catalyst bed is kept, between 300 and 3800 C, preferably between 320 and 3500 C. When methanol and optionally steam are fed to the catalyst bed, the steam to methanol ratio is less than 0.8, preferably less than 0.2 mole steam mole methanol. The entrance temperature to the catalyst bed is kept between 150 and 5000 C, preferably between 200 and 2500 a. A hydrogen containing gas can be added to the feed mixture in such an amount that the temperature rise over the catalyst bed is between 150 and 3000 C, preferably between 200 and 2500 C.Methanol can be present in the feed mixture in a wide range with referance to the hydrocarbons. In practical procedure the methanol in many times is present in the feed mixture in an amount of more than 0.05 moles, preferably more than 0.2 moles of methanol per mol of hydrocarbons. It is possible, that the feed mixture is essentially free of hydrocarbons and comprises methanol and optionally steam, wherein it is preferred that the steam to methanol ratio is less than 0.8, preferably less than 0.2 moles steam per mol methanol.The ratio of steam to hydrocarbons, preferably, if no methanol is present1 is, calculated as moles of steam per carbon atom of the hydrocarbons in the feed mixture below 1.35, preferably below 1.3, and more preferably below 1.2. This ratio should be above 0.8, preferably above 0.9 and more preferably above lo Because the nickel particles need to be individually chemically bonded to the support a carrier material has to be used that has a large specific surface area together with a large reactivity. The maximum obtainable loading of chemically bonded nickel depends On the reactivity and the specific surface area.In particular, it was found that Ni SiO2 catalysts are highly suitable for the process of the invention.The presence of an interfacial layer containing nickel ions in the active catalyst can be established in several ways. The oxidation state of nickel in catalysts of this type is normally II. According to one method, first the total nickel content of the catalyst is determined, e.g. by means of atomic absorption spectrometry. Next,the amount of metallic nickel per unit weight of catalyst can be found by measuring. the saturation magnetisation of the catalyst sample. The saturation magnetisation found is a direct measure of the amount of metallic nickel present. The difference between the total amount of nickel and the amount of metallic nickel represents the amount of nickel that is present in the interfacial layer in the form of Ni II ions. Alternatively the nickel content that is present as nickel ions in the interfacial layer can be establishdd by measuring the consumption of hydrogen during reduction of the catalyst precursor in a H2 containing atmosphere at temperatures that are also used during the catalyst operation. Subsequently the consumption measured is compared with the volume of hydrogen that would be required for complete reduction of all nickel ions present. Broom the difference between the two values found the amount of Ni CII ions can be calculated. A third way to establish the presence of Ni II ions in the active catalyst is to measure the increase in weight of a catalyst sample, that previously has been reduced under reaction conditions, during reoxidation of the sample in a 02 containing atmosphere. When after reduction part of the nickel is present in the interfacial layer in the form of Ni 11 ions the uptake of 02, and hence the Increase in weight, will be smaller during reoxidati on than when after reduction all the nickel has been reduced. Comparison of the actual increase in weight with the theoretical increase calculated from the total amount of nickel in the sample yields information on the amount of nickel that is present as Ni II ions in the interfacial layer in the active catalyst under reaction conditions.Catalysts used in this invention have preferably nickel ions in the interfacial layer in an amount of at least 5 preferably at least 10 , more preferably at least 20 by weight of the total amount of nickel in the catalyst. The upper limit should be 60 , preferably 50 more preferably 40 ffi by weight.In the above description two methods have been mentioned to achieve a strong ineraction between the nickel particles and the carrier material.In one of these methods use is made of a carrier, which is to be reduced partially. The compounds or metal atoms produced in reducing the carrier show strong interaction with both the nickel particles and the carrier. An example of such a carrier is TiO2. When heated in a reducing gasTiO2 is reduced to a TiOx oxide when x has a value smaller than 2. The oxide reduced at the interface of the nickel particles ensures a strong bond of the nickel particle to the carrier, provided the nickel has been deposited homogeneously over the support and in intimate contact with it.When catalysts are prepared as described in BE A 2 547 326 by impregnation, drying and subsequent pretreatment the active material is inhomogeneously distributed over the support. Especially at more elevated metal loadings this leads to large clusters of nickel particles only some of which are chemically bonded to the support. The interaction of these loose particles with the support remains small even after partial reduction of the carrier. Therefore catalysts prepared according to ER A 2 347 326 are not suitable for the process according to the invention.The presence of a partially reduced carrier under conditions of the reaction cam be established in the active catalyst in 2 ways. According to one method the metallic nickel content of the catalyst is determined by measuring the saturation magnetisation of a sample of known weight, which previously has been reduced under reaction conditions. Afterwards the sample is reoxidised in an 2 containing atmosphere and simultaneously the increase in weight owing to oxidation of the metallic nickel and, if partially reduced, of the carrier is measured. By comparing the actual increase in weight with the increase that would be expected from oxidation of the metallic nickel only, the extent of reduction of the support can be calculated.In the catalysts used in this invention the increase in weight during oxidaton should exceed the increase exclusively caused by oxidation of the nickel metal by at least 10 , preferably by at least 20 . Alternatively, the extent of reduction of the carrier can be determined by measuring the consumption of H2 during reduction of the completely re oxidised catalyst in a H2 containing atmosphere at temperatures that are also used in the process of this invention. Subsequently, the consumption measured is compared with the amount of H2 that would be required to yield the amount of nickel which eventually is present as metallic nickel particles in the reduced catalyst. he amount of metallic nickel in the catalyst can be calculated, as indicated above, from a measurement of the saturation magnetisation.From the difference between the actually measured v olume ard the volume exclusively required for reduction of the nickel in the oxidised form, the extent of reduction of the support can be determined.In the catalysts used in this invention the consumption during reduction of the catalyst should exceed the consumption exclusively required for reduction of the oxidic nickel by at least 10 , preferably by at least 20 . The nickel particle size distribution can be determined by electron microscope study. Another, faster and more accurate method of determining the particle size distribution is by means of magnetism.Magnetization is measured as a function of the field strength and the particle size distribution is so computed that the experimental magnetization curve is reproduced. The computed curve produces an unambiguous particle size distribution, corresponding with the distribution found by means of electron microscope examination.The process of the invention, largely described in the state of the art, is performed in the following way.The installation consists of tree sections 1. First section in which hydrocarbons are treated with hydrogen in a fixed bed reactor over a cobalt molybdate catalyst at a temperature of between 300 and 400 C, to convert the organic sulphur compounds present into hydrogen sulphide. 2. A second section in which the hydrogen sulphide formed is absorbed over a zinc oxide bed in a fixed bed reactor at a temperature between 300 and 3500 C. The hydrogen sulphide is converted to steam in this section.3. A third section, which is the actual low temperature reforming section, where steam and optionally a hydrogen containing gas are added to the treated hydrocarbon feed and then led to a fixed bed reactor filled with the catalyst of the invention, after optional additional preheating to a temperature of between 300 and 14500 C, to form a methane rich gas which can then be further processed.Typical product gas compositions have been given in the literature cited before. In compliarce with the state of the art, it is also possible to perform the low temperature reforming step in a split bed operation as described in DE A 23 14 804. Likewise, the process of EP A 0028835 is embodied in our present invention. An additiona advantage is that the process of the invention can work with gases with a relatively low HCO ratio in the first stage of the process of EP A 0028835, as can be concluded from t e disclosure of NL A 82 005 44.Another option with regard to the above process description is the use of an Fe2O3 Si 2 absorption mass instead of the zinc oxide bed. This absorption mass has been described in DE A 31 31 257 and 32 28 481. It has the great advantage at it can be regenerated, as opposed with ZrO which must be disposed of after use , while it fulfills the process requirements of having a Sulphide end concentration in the ppm range, as is required for the downstream reforming step. The latter option would mean a considerably more economic process performance when the sulohur content of the feedstock is relatively high as is the case with certain heavier oil fractions.If, according to the invention, methanol is converted, without the presence of hydrocarbons, the hydro sulphurisation step and the zinc absorbent step can be omitted, since sulphides will mostly not be present in substanial amounts. Meeting the appopriate process reauirements is well known in the state of the art so that we need not explain this further.It is stronghly indicated by our experiments th in the use of nickel catalysts for the conversion of hydrocarbons or methanol as described hereinbe fore, deactivation of these catalysts was caused by the formation oe carbon between the nickelparticle and the carrier. This carbon grows into thread like bodies so called whiskers which pus the nickel particles away from the carrier. It turned out that this phenomenon does not take place if the nickel is chemically bonded to the carrier surface.It was found that only a small amount of nonchemically bonded nickel can be allowed in the catalysts used in this invention. This amount should not exceed 50 mg, more preferably 30 mg and most preferably 10 mg per cm3 reactor volume, as pointed out above already. When the amount of unbonded nickel exceeds such amounts the catalyst bed will gradually be plugged due to the growth of carbon whiskers. It was established, that very large nickel particles of dimensions of about 100 nm are slowly deactivated under reaction conditions. Nickel particles of such a large size often contain grain boundaries. It is known Carbon 1972 , pages 601 to 611 that at these grain boundaries carbon can be deposited due the which the particles are broken up. The growth of carbon whiskers continues after the nickel particles have been fragmented, which eventually results in reactor plugging. However, nickel particles of dimensions smaller than 30 nm generally do not contain grain boundaries.Hence, whisker growth induced by grain boundaries will not occur in these particles. Therefore, the catalyst should contain essentially no particles having a particle size over 30 nin. When carbon is intentionally deposited on a catalyst used according to the present invention by passing pure CO over the catalyst at 2 So C, and the carbon is then removed by heating the catalyst in a hydrogen stream at temperatures up to 4500 C, it appears that the nickel particle size distribution has not significantly change This proves that no carbon has been deposited between the nickel particles and the carrier.In contrast it has been found that in regenerating conventional catalysts, in which carbon has been deposited between the nickel particles and the carrier, far bigger nickel particles are formed than the particles that were present in the original catalyst.According to the invention, essentially all the metallic nickel particles must be chemically bonded to the carrier particles. It was observed, that when an appreciable amount of the metallic nickel particles is not chemically bonded to the carrier, these loose nickel particles will cause whisker carbon formation, leading to catalyst deactivation and reactor plugging.The relative amount of particles, bonded to the carrier via an interfacial layer can be determined in the following three ways 1. A sample of the reduced, active catalyst is investigated in the electron microscope, in order to count the number of metallic nickel particles per gram of catalyst as well as their average size. A similar sample is treated with gaseous pure CO at ambient atmosphere at a temperature between 60 and 1000 C for such a time period as is required to remove all metallic nub nickel from the catalyst by formation of gaseous Ni C0 4. Thus only the nickel that is present as ionic nickel in the interfacial layers re mains in the catalyst.By electron microscopic investigation the number of interfacial layers of roughly the same surface size as the original metallic particles can be counted per gram bf catalyst. For a catalyst according to the invention, this number should essentially equal the number, found for the number of metallic nickel particles per gram of catalyst. From the differences between the number of nickel metal particles and the number of nickel interfaces, the amount of free or loose nickel particles and the weight quantity of loose metallic nickel can be calculated. 2. A sample of the reduced, active catalyst is treated with a gas mixture of 90 ffi N2 and 10 CO at normal pressure at a temperature of 4000 C for a time period of between 10 and 60 hours0 The sample is then cooled dorm and passivated. Electron microscopic investiga tion will then show, depending on whether the catalyst is suitable according to the invention, or not, that carbon whiskers have been formed. These carbon whiskers are only formed at I loosett metallic nickel particles which are not bonded to the carrier. Thus, the amount of these unbonded particles per gram of catalyst material can be found. 3. For the case that the carrier material consists of an oxide of a base element which is partially reducible, the bonded nickel particles can be quanttatively determinded by currently available electon microscopic methods. The use of catalysts, prepared according toDE C 17 67 202, for the reforming of hydrocarbons with steam, optionnally with the addition of methanol, or for the conversion of methanol directly, optionally with steam addition has never been suggested. It is surprising that, when using these catalysts, catalyst deactivation and carbon deposition are so much reduced as compared with catalysts according to the state of the art.Generally a marked production of non reduced nickel atoms is considered to be unfavourable, since nickel is the active component.It is even more surprising that catalyst deactivation does not occur at steam to hydrocarbon ratios which are within the thermodynamic carbon deposition area.Under conditions that carbon deposition is inevitable, our catalysts exhibit still another attractive property, namely the fact that they can be savely regenerated or re activated with oxygen and subsequently with E2. This is quite remarkable since reforming catalysts according to the state of the art cannot be regenerated. Obviously this presents considerable technical advantages.In view of the low tendency of our catalysts for carbon formation, it proved possible to employ them in low temperature reforming of hydrocarbons, with steam to carbon ratios of less than 0.9, even 0.8, and even less than 0.7 mole steam atom carbon of the hydrocarbons . In processes according to the state of the art, the steam to carbon ratio mole atom is mostly larger than 1.2, since catalyst deactivation is quite rapid at lower steam to carbon ratios.The fact that we can use lower steam to hydrocarbon ratios allows smaller catalyst volumes and consequently smaller reactors at equal space velocities.The fact that our catalyst can be used in the direct conversion of methanol without steam and without measurable deactivation over time perios of 500 1000 hours, is also quite surprising. This gives a great flexibility as to the feed employable in a process for methane production from liquid feedstocks.Another interesting phenomenon is the high catalyst activity at already low temperatures.Whereas most commercial catalysts are active for the steam reforming of hydrocarbons at temperatures above 350 C, in most cases even above 4000 C, our catalyst has already a considerable activity at a temperature of 3000 C.This is shown in the examples. Still another advantageous property of our new type of catalyst is the fact that the activation procedure, i.e. the reduction of the pre reduced and subsequently passivated catalyst with hydrogen, is not very critical. It can be performed at relatively high temperature wit a gas containing a high hydrogen psrtial pressure.Obviously this reduces the start up time of the process which is very favourable. The activation procedure s cescribed in preparation example 2, It should be noted that in EP A 0028835 a t o stage process for the production of methane has been described, in the first stage of which a mixture containing 25 to 90 ss by vol. of hydrogen as well as carbon monoxide and caroon dioxide is passed over a nickel catalyst at a temperature of from 2500 C bis 550 C to produce a methane rich gas product. or this process the nickel catalyst describe in DE C 17 67 202 may be used, with alumina as the oxidic carrier.However, this is not an embodiment of the present invention, since by this method no catalyst with chemically bonded nickel will be obtained. This would require a special preparatio procedure as mentioned previously.As is described in the previous state of the art EP A 0028835 , the addition of hydrogen rich gas to the reactor feed will reduce catalyst deactivation. Though in our catalyst, deactivation due to carbon deposition is nuch reduced as compared with conventional catalysts, the presence of hydrogen rich, or more general, hydrogen containing gases may be technologically attractive.An advantageous property OT our catalyst still to be mentioned for such case, is the fact that it allows a considerable temperature rise over the catalyst bed of over 2000 C, even over 3000 C, so that, Xrssen the temperature at the entrance o, she catalyst bed is e.g. 3500 C the reactor exit temperature is allowed to amount to 550 C or even, when the entrance temperature is e.g. 300 C, the exit 0 temperature can amount to G00 C, by virtue of the hydrogen present invoking exothermal hydrogenation reactions.In view of the above explanation the present invention also covers a process for regenerating a nickel catalyst for use in the production of methane rich gases by the conversion of a mixture comprising hydrocarbons, steam, and optionally methanol or of methanol and optionally steam, characterized in that the nickel catalyst is a catalyst in which the metallic nickel particles are chemically bonded to a thermally stable oxidic carrier and that it is regenerated by the following steps a the catalyst is retained in the reactor in which it has been used and has lost its original activity due to carbon deposition, and the feed gas mixture is shut, b the reactor is purged with an inert gas, preferably nitrogen, until essentially no feed gas components or gaseous reaction products remain in the reactor, c the carbon deposits are burnt by feeding to the reactor an oxygen containing gas and limiting the maximum temperature in the reactor at 6O00C, d the reactor is purged with an inert gas, preferably nitrogen, until essentially no oxygen remains in the reactor, e the catalyst is reduced with hydrogen at temperatures from 200 to 4500C to its active form.In step c the itiax. temperature is preferably below 5500c or even below 5000C.The invention also covers a regenerated ziickel catalyst obtainable by such process, and it covers the use of such reactivated nickel catalyst for catalysi ng the conversion of a mixture comprising hydrocarbons, steam, and optionally methanol or of methanol and optionally steam to produce methane rich gases, as described above in detail.For the regeneration procedure described above the following parameters are preferred Purging is preferably done with nitrogen of ambient temperature so that the temperature in the reactor will decrease during the purging step. Subsequently, a nitrogen flow containing a minor amount of about 0.01 to 1, preferably about 0.1 oxygen is fed to the reactor at about ambient temperature leading to partial passivation of the catalystThe oxygen concentration is then gradualiy raised to a maxirur concentration of about 20 air in order to avoid any hotspots due to the oxidation reaction.The temperature in the reactor should be kept below 6000C preferably below 500 C at all ties, Subsequently, the reactor is again purged with nitrogen in order to remove any oxygen present after which the reactivation procedure which is essentially similar to the original activation procedure of the catalyst using hydrogen containing gas is performed. This is preferably done at a temperature between 200 and 4500C, more preferred between 400 and 4500C. Preparation example 1. 8.8g metallic nickel 43.6 g of Ni NO3 2.6H2O was dissolved in 1 litre of water in which 9.0 g SiO2 Aerosil trade mark of Degussa , having a surface area of 380 mê gram had been suspended. The temperature of the vigorously stirred suspension as then raised to 90 C C, and the solution was acidified dropwise with nitric acid, until a p E of 2 was attained.Subsequently 27.0 g of urrea was added, which resulted in a gradual rise of the p11, whereby ric tel was deposited on the silica in hydro oxidic or. The loaded carrier was then separated ftom the liquid, dried at 1200 C, pressed to pellets, and then cut into pieces ranging from 1.5 to 2.5 mm.Next, the catalyst pieces where dehydrated in nitrogen stream at a temperature up to 450 C and then reduced in a stream of LO hydrogen in argon for at least 80 hours. Before the execution of the tests as described in the examples following hereafter, the catalyst was freed from absorbed hydrogen in a nitrogen stream at 4500 C for two ours. The nickel particle size distribution of te catalyst thus obtained, is given in table 1. PreDaration example 2.This example describes the activation of a so called passivated catalyst. A catalyst containing a metal as the active component, is in general supplied by the manufacturer in a so called passivated orn. This means, that the catalyst is irst completely reduced to form the active metal, and subsequently the catalyst is treated with e.g. diluted air or with C02, so as to form a very thin oxide layer covering the metal particles, and protecting them against further oxidation. Thus the catalyst can e easily handled and transported, since the reduced catalyst is generally pyrophorous in air, cue to the presence of very small metal particles. The latter would be difficult and expensive to handle.A catalyst sample, prepared according to preparation example 1, incorporating dehydration and reduction, was evacuated for 5 hours at 400 C to achieve complete desorption of the adsorbed hydrogen from the nickel surface. Afterwards, the nickel surface area was measured by hydrogen adsorption at 300 C. At a hydrogen pressure of 40 kPa the uptake of H2 was 25 ml 112 STP g Ni.Subsequently the catalyst was evacuated at LO 0O C and passivated at room temperature by passing a flow of 0.5 O2 at a temperature which gradually rose from 750 C to 3000 C in a period of three hours. The catalyst was then kept in the reducing atmosphere at 3000 C for another three hours.Then the above mentinned evacuation procedure was again carried out. The subsequent uptake o hydrogen at 300 C and at a hydrogen pressure of 40 kPa was again 25 ml SUP g Ni, indicating t the original nickel surface area was again available after the re activation procedure of 6 hours. Example I A cylindrical reactor tube made of stainless steel was filled with a sample of the catalyst prepared and pretreated as described in preparation example l. The catalyst bed was 1. 1.8 cm in diameter and 17 cm in height. The catalyst sample in the reactor contained 6.3 g of reduced nickel. Before a reaction mixture of 14.3 CH4H10 and 85.7 N2 entered the reactor, an amount of 6.7 mmol min 1 of water was added to this mixture in the preheater kept at 450 C. The temperature at the entrance of the reactor was kept at 4000 C. H O C 0.8 . 2The space velocity in the reactor was 700 hr at atmospheric pressure. To establish, whether catalyst plugging owing to carbon deposition occurred the pressure drop over the catalyst bed was recorded continuously. The experiment was continued over a period of about 70 hrs. The product gas, the composition of which did not change throughout the experiment, did not contain butane and consisted of 31.9 CH4, 7,4 CO , 0.2 CO, 2.5 H ,H O mainly condensed. Cnot determined quantitatively and N2. Luring the experiment no increase in pressure drop was observed, indicating the absence of severe filamentous carbon deposition and consequent catalyst plugging. At the end of the experiment after 70 hrs the temperature at the entrance of the reactor was lowered to 3500 C for 4 h. Complete conversion of butane was attained at this temperature. The product gas consisted of 32.4 CH4, 7.3 CO , 0.06 ffi CO, mainly condensed. 1.3 H2,H2O not determined quantitatively andN2. After 4 hrs the temperature was further decreased from 350 to 3000 C. The conversion of butane dropped to 6 only. After 2 h at 3000 C tiic temperature was increased again to 350 C. Whereas butane was completely converted at 3500 C before the temperature was lowered to 300 C, a terwros the conversion was limited to 50 and gradually decreased in 18 h to about 40 .At a subsequent increase of the temperature o 400 C the conversion rose to 96 . After another 72 hrs at 400 C the experiment was stopped and the catalyst was subjected to the regeneration procedure described in example 2.Examle 2 The catalyst sample, which had been subjected to the reaction sequence described in example 1, was regenerated in the following procedure.The sample was cooled in a N2 stream to 25 C.Next the catalyst was passivated in a mixture of about 0.5 Vo 0 and 99.5 N2. Then the 2 catalyst was heated by 50 C hê 1 from 25 to 450 C in a flow of 20 O2 and 80 N2 to burn off the carbon from the nickel surface, which had been deposited owing to the temperature excursion to 300 C C, described in the previous example. The temperature was kept constant at 450 C for 5 hrs. Subsequently the sample was cooled down to 100 C in a N2 flow and afterwards heated up again to 450 C in a flow of 10 H2 and 90 N2. The heating rate was 12 50 C h . After 16 hrs at 450 C in theH2 N2 mixture the catalyst was freed from adsorbed hydrogen in a flow of nitrogen at 0 450 C for 2 hrs. Immediately thereafter the experiment described in Example 3 was performed. Example 3 The catalyst sample regenerated and re reduced as described in Example 2 was exposed to a reaction mixture which was obtained as in Example 1 by adding 6.7 mmol min 1 of H20 to a mixture of 14.3 C4H10 and 85.7 N2. The temperature at the entrance of the reactor was kept at 350 C. The space velocity in the reactor of a volume of 43.2 cm3 was 700 hKat atmospheric pressure. The product gas the composition of which did not change through out the experiment which lasted for 50 hrs, did not contain butane. H20 C ratio was 0.8 . 2In Example 1 it was seen that prior to regeneration the conversion of butane at 3500 C was only 40 . Hence the absence of butane in the product gas of the regenerated catalyst illustrates the effectiveness of the procedure set out in detail in Example 2. The product gas constisted of 32.4 CH4, 7.3 CO2, 0.06 CO, 1.3 H2, H2O . mainly condensed, not determined quantitatively and N2. At the end of the successive experiments described in examples 1,2 and 3, with a total duration of about 260 hrs, the pressure drop over the reactor was still negligibly small which indicates that noticeable carbon deposition had not occurred. Example 4 A 50 wt. Ni SiO2 catalyst was prepared according to example 1. The fresh catalyst was dried in air for 24 hrs at 1200C , pressed into tablets 1500 kg cm 2, ground and sieved to pellet size 0.15 0.30 mm. The catalyst was.calcined in a 10 O2 He stream at 4500C for 16 hrs and reduced in a 10 H2 Ar stream for more than 72 hrs at4500C. The average nickel particle size of the so prepared catalyst was 6 nm diameter .A cylindrical quartz reactor diameter 1,0 cm was filled with 2.0 ml of the catalyst. The catalyst bed, containing O.52g of nickel, exposed some 45 m2 of nickel surface to the gasphase.A gas mixture containing 7 vol. of methanol in nitrogen was fed to the reactor at a space velocity of 1750 her . After attainment of the steady state typically within 15 min the product composition was monitored for at least 3 hrs using gaschromatographic analysis. Variations in the steady state were usually well within 1 . All compounds except water, which was obtained from the mass balance, were measured directly.As can be seen from Fig. 1 the measured productcompositions are within experimental error estimated to be about 2 equal to the equilibrium compositions from 3670C onward. The small disrepancy at lower temperatures is due to the incomplete hydrogenation of carbonmonoxide at the mentioned space velocity. Compounds not included inFig. 1 e.g. methanol, ethane were never deteeted in concentrations above 10 ppm. In a separate experiment the steady state composition at 3290 C was established to persist for more than 40 hrs. Moreover, returning to a temperature of 309 C after about 100 hrs of operation at various temperatures up to 4470C did not change the initial catalyst performance as given by the outlet composition of Fig. 1.Example 5A reactor and catalyst as described inExample 4 were used.A gasmixture consisting of 5.5 vol. Vo of methanol ans 10 vol. Va of hydrogen, balanced with nitrogen, was fed to the reactor containing 2 ml of the catalyst at a space velocity of 1750 hr 1.The reactor outlet compositions1 compiled inFig. 2, show that adding hydrogen to the feed also results in equilibrium compositions for temperatures of 368 C and higher. Small differences with equilibrium compositions at lower temperatures are again attributed to inc omplete hydrogenation of carbonmonoxide at the space velocity used. Example 6A sample of the catalyst prepared and pretreated according to Preparation Example I was put into the reactor described in Example 1. The sample contained 5.6 g of metallic nickel. At a reactor entry temperature of 400 C the catalyst was exposed to a reaction mixture, which was composed of C4H10 2.1 mmol min H20 steam 11.2 mmol min 1 and N2 12.4 mmol min 1 . The steam to carbon ratio was 1.35. The space velocity applied was about 750 h 1 at atmospheric pressure.The absolute pressure in the reactor was 120 kPa. During the experiment the temperature in the catalyst bed was measured at 9 equidistant heights along the axis of the reactor. Moreover, to establish whether reactor plugging due to filamentous carbon deposition occurred, the pressure drop across the catalyst bed was recorded continuously. It was found that the butane was converted completely.After condensation of most of the water unreacted the product gas was composed of 31.3 o CH4, 7.6 CO2, 3.7 H2 0.07 CO, H20 mainly condensed not determined quantitative and N . During the experiment, which lasted for 450 hr, the temperature profile through the catalyst bed did not change markedly. Moreover, at the end of the experiment the pressure drop across the reactor was still negligibly small, which proves the absence of reactor plugging due to carbon deposition on the catalyst. This conclusion was confirmed by examination of the spent catalyst in the electron microscope, which revealed that the catalyst did not contain carbon filaments at all. Example 7A sample of the catalyst prepared and pretreated according to Preparation Example I was put into the reactor described in Example 1.The sample contained 5.1 g of metallic nickel. The catalyst was exposed at 400 C to a reaction mixture which was compo sed of C4H10 18.6 mmol min 1 , H20 1202 2 mmol min 1 and N2 12.4 mmol min 1 . The space velocity applied was about 1100 h 1 at atmospheric pressure. The conversion of butane initially was abort 505 , but rapidly decreased to less than 10 after 70 hr. Apparently, the activity of the catalyst could not withstand the extremely small steam to carbon ratio of 0.16. After 75 hr the experiment was stopped.During the experiment no increase in pressure drop across the reactor was observed. This is in marked contrast with the performance of other catalysts. It is known from the state of the art, that steam absence, or too low steam concentrations will result in rapid carbon deposition over normal nickel catalysts in a 1hydrocarbon atmosphere leading to reactor plugging within less than a few hours. Examination of the spent catalyst in the electron microscope revealed that only very few carbon filaments of diameters of about 10 nm had been formed. As will be shown in Example catalysts according to the invention thus deactivated can regain their original activity by a treatment in air at elevated temperatures. Processes of this type are always designed for such operating conditions that an uninErupted production can be guaranteed for several thousand hours.However, there may arise emergency situations due to sudden blockage of steam supply for which emergency procedures are always taken into the design. In these procedures the performance of the catalyst is of big importance. If the catalyst is very vulnerable to the possibility of carbon deposition then much damage will be done in an emergency case. Therefore, emergency procedures designed for such cases will be very strict. On the other hand, if the catalyst is less vulnerable for such emergency cases because carbon deposition will not occur very rapidly as we have shown now for our catalyst, then the emergency procedures may be less strict with obviously economic advantages. Example 8A sample of the catalyst prepared and pretreated according to Preparation Example 1 was put into the reactor described in Example 1. The sample contained 5.0 g of metallic nickel. At a reactor entry temperature of 400 C the catalyst was exposed to a reaction mixture, which was composed of C4H10 4.1 mmol mien 1 , H2 1.3 mmol min , H20 13.9 mmol min and N2 6.1 mmol min 1 . The steam to carbon ratio was 0.85. The space velocity applied was about 730 h l at atmospheric pressure. During the experiment the temperature in the catalyst bed was measured at 9 equidistant heights along the axis of the reactor. In addition to establish whether reactor plugging owing the filamentous carbon deposition occurred, the pressure drop across the catalyst bed was recorded continuously. It was found that initially the butane was converted completely. After condensation of most of the water unreacted the product gas was composed of 59.4 CH4, 13.6 CO2, 6.6 H2, 0.07 CO, H20 mainly condensed not determined quantitatively and N2. From the temperature profile measured in the catalyst bed it was obvious that the reaction zone gradually passed through the catalyst bed. Apparently, the activity of the catalyst steadily decreased. Owing to the deactivation butane was present in the product gas in tiny amounts after about 200 h. After 550 h the conversion of butane decreased to only 42 . As the pressure drop across the catalyst bed did not increase at all, it was concluded that extensive filamentous carbon deposition did not occur. Hence, the gradual decrease of the catalytic activity was attributed to the formation of non filamentous carbonaceous deposits poisoning the nickel surface. It was tried to Deactivate the partially deactivated cata lyst by a treatment in air at elevated temperatures, follo wed by reactivation in a reduction step. To this end the reaction sequence described in detail in Example 2 which procedures comprises passivation, oxidation and re reduction was carrier out in situ. Afterwards the reaction mixture was passed once more through the catalyst bed under identical conditions as described above, It was established that butane was again converted completely. After another 200 hr the conversion of butane was still virtually complete. Then the catalyst was deactivated owing to maloperation causing a high partial pressure of butane in the catalyst bed for several hours. The deactivated catalyst was reactivated for the second time in exactly the same way as before.Subse quently the reaction mixture was again passed through the catalyst bed. For about 200 h after the restart of the experiment the temperature profile in the catalyst bed hardly changed, Afterwards a gradual deactivation of the catalyst was apparent from a continuous shift of the temperature profile through the catalyst bed. At about 400 h after the second restart the experiment was stopped. At that time the conversion of butane was still above 9909 . The pressure drop across the catalyst bed was still as small as at the very beginning of the experiment indicating the absence of extensive filamentous carbon deposition. Table 1Fraction, by vol.
