# Burner for burning a liquid fuel.

## Abstract
A burner for burning a liquid fuel comprises a burner head 23 at which a mixture of air and the vapours of the fuel is burned in a substantially stable flame 24 . At least some of the air for the mixture is supplied by a low pressure fan 16 or equivalent airsupply device, and the fuel vapour is generated by a vapourizer 11 which operates independently of the presence of any flame at the burner head, the liquid fuel being converted to fuel vapour, without contacting hot gases and or oxygen containing gas, at atmospheric pressure or slightly above. A conduit 15 conducts air at approximately atmospheric pressure from the fan 16 to the burner head 23 via an air swirl device 21 which imparts a swirling or vortex flow to the air. Fuel vapour passes from the vapourizer 11 into the conduit 15 at, or downstream of, the location of the air swirl device 21 so that the fuel vapour is thoroughly mixed with the air.

## Description
The pr s nt invention r la s to a bu for bu ing a liquid u , par cu ly but n t x l ively a liquid f of the type used for domesti heating. In on kn wn burner of this type, as des bed in French patent specification No 2257036 and in U.K. patent sp cification No. 1479686, fuel is heated and vapourized in an upwardly extending tube, and the vapouls are separated from the unapourized liquid in a chamber abov the tube, the liquid being recovered from the chamber in a downwardly extending tube which receives, in addition, a feed of cold liquid fuel, and which communicates at its bottom with the upwardly extending tube.The fuel vapour is sucked out of the chamber by entrainment in combustion air passing through an ejector which connunicates the reduced pressure in its jet pump to fuel vapourizer thereby reducing the fuel boiling temperature. A drawback of this burner is that the air supplied to the ejector must be at a relatively high pressure to suck the fuel vapour effectively from the fuel vapourizer and to overcome the back pressure of the ejector. Accordingly, a relatively noisy air supply fan must be used. Another drawback of this type of burner is that it has been observed that the vapourization of the fuel does not procecd in a uniform manner and that accordingly, the size and appearance of the flame tends to vary. In another burner of this type described in U.S. patent specification 2,123,884, air at a relatively high pressure is employed to generate a low pressure in an ejector so as to entrain vapourized fuel from a vapourizing chamber, the air and fuel vapour being mixed on passing through the divergent diffuscr of the ejector where the kinetic energy is at least partly converted to pressure energy, and some of the mixture is recirculated to the vapourizing chamber from the downstream end of the diffuser, after combustion, in order to convert liquid fuel to fuel vapour.This burner also is noisy since a relatively high p u e blo st be mployed to pr vide su ci y to enti in the fuel vapour, to over ome the back pressure of the j o also to furnish sufficient pressure ene gy to re ir ulaie some of the air fuel vapour mixtu e to the vapourizing chember and to bubble the mixture through liquid fuel in the chamber. The liquid fuel in the chamber is exposed to hot recirculated combustion gases and or oxygen containing gases which tend to cause the fuel to degrade and form deposits in the chamber necessitating relatively frequent burner shutdowns for cleaning and maintenance.Moreover, the control of the flow of fuel vapour must be effected by a throttle valve and no means are provided for automatically securing a particular ratio of air to fuel. Burners of the foregoing types are so constructed that the mixture of air and fuel vapour pass to the burner head through a relatively long downstream section of conduit, and there is, in consequencc, an undesirably large amount of fuel vapour in the downstream conduit section which gives rise to fuel vapour condensation especially during the start up of the burner and fouling on the walls of the downstream conduit section necessitating that the latter must be constructed and arranged in such a way that it can be removed for cleaning from time to time thus increasing the cost and degree of complication of the burner. In addition, at shut down of the burner, there may tend to be an emission of fuel vapour to the atmosphere.The fuel vapour condensation which tends to take place during start up tends to make the timing of the start up of the burner more erratic than desirable. The pre nt invention prov des a burner for burning a liquid fuel, ising a bu ne h d in which a mixture of air as hereinafter de ned and vapour of the liquid fuel is bu n in a ubstantially stable flano air supply moans operable to supply at least sc of the air fcr forming ti. said luiiture of air and fuel vapour 6 conduit for conducting air from the said air supply means to the burncr head air swirl means for imparting 2 swirling or vortex flow to air in the conduit vapourizr which is operable independently of the presence of any flame at the burner head for converting liquid fuel to vapours of the liquid fuel out of contact with oxygen containing gas or hot gases and a fuel vapour duct for conducting fuel vapour from the vapourizer into the said conduit at or downstream of the location of the air swirl means. In this patent specification, the term air is intended to comprehend any oxygen containing gas. In preferred embodimants of the invention, the length of conduit between the air swirl means and the burner head is as short as possible. Because the fuel vapour is mixed with swirling air, problems due to condensation and fouling in the conduit at locations between the region at which fuel vapour enters the conduit and the burner head are substantially reduced or eliminated. Preferably the fuel vapour duct is so disposed as to introduce fuel vapour into the conduit at a region where the static pressure of the fuel vapour is substantially equal to,or preferably slightly greater than, the static pressure of the air in that region. It is preferred that the static pressure in that region should be approximately equal to atmospheric pressure. The vapourizer preferably operates to generate fuel vapour at a pressure approximately equal to, or slightly greater than, atmospheric pressure. bly, the vapou has no more than two open erif s th , n being for the s pply of l quid fuel to the vap u izer and the other being the entrance to the fu vap ur du t. The vapou iz preferably comprises a substantially vertical ris r conduit side by side with a substa tially v rtical down omer conduit, the riser conduit and downcomer conduit communi ating with each other at or near their bottoms, a disengaging chamber connecting the tops cf the riser and downcomer conduits for the disengsgement of fuel vapour from liquid fuel, and heating means disposed for hearing liquid fuel in the riser onduit to its boiling temperat ure, said heating means preferably defining with the internal wall of the riser conduit a relatively narrow substantially vertical space for the upward circulation of a mixture of liquid and vapourized fuel generated by the action of the heating means on liquid fuel when in the vapourizer Liquid fuel is preferably supplied to the bottom region of the riser conduit from a constant liquid level regulating device. In one type cf embodiment of the invention, the emission of fuel vapour from the burner at shut down may be substantially prevented by the provision of a suitable valve member which closes the fuel vapour duct when operated. Tie valve ember may be operated by electro mechanical means which are actuated on burner shut down. In preferred embodiments of the invention, the air swirl means is substantially symmetrically disposed about the axis of the exit of the fuel vapour duct. This arrangement facilitates the provision and operation of the valve member. In another type of embodiment, means may be provided for passing a relatively large volume of unheated liquid fuel at a relatively fast regulated rate into the vapourizer when the bur ner is being shut dowel in order to cool fuel in the vapourizer below tile temperature range at which fuel vapour is produced in order to avoid or reduce the amount of fuel vapour emission at burner shut down. Means are preferably provided to enable liquid fuel above the l vel set by the consi nt level device to return to a liquid fuel reserveir when the buiner is being started. The invention is now further deseribed with reference to embodiments ther of, given by way of non limitative examples, and with reference to the accompanying diagr mm tic drawings in which Figure 1 is an elevation of a vertical cross section through a burner according to the invention Figure 2 is a perspective drawing showing, schematieally, the principal parts of one type of air swirl device which can be used in the burner of figure 1 Figure 3 is an clevation of a vertical cross section of the air swirl device of figure 2 Figure 4 is a plan of a horizontal section through the device of figures 2 and 3 Figure 5 is a schematic elevation of a vertical cross section through the top part of another burner according to the invention and Figure 6 is a plan of a horizontal cross section of part of the equipment shown in Figure 5. Referring first to figure 1, the burner is generally indicated by reference 10 and comprises a, vapourizer 11, for converting liquid fuel into vapours of the liquid fuel, surrounded by insulation and supplied with unseated liquid fuel from a constant level tank not shown via pipe 12 and feed pipe 13. The constant level tank is of any type and maintains the liquid fuel level at the level L. A metal casing 14 surrounds the insulation so as to define a space 15 between the casing 14 and the insulation through which air for combustion of the fuel vapour can pass. At the bottom of the casing 14 is mounted an axial flow a r fan 16 generating relatively low pressures to avoid noise.The fan is driven by an electric motor 17 and has a maximum pressure drop of about 40 mms 1120 at zero flow and about 5 mms 1120 at normal flow rate, with a power com ion of about 25W. The fan, wh n p g, passes air for co bustion upw rdly through the sp ce 15. The top of the space 15 is bound d by a hori ontal metal casing ber 18 ha ing a c ntral hole 19 therethrough. Beneath the hole 19, and substantially oaxial therewith, is a conduit 20 which serves as the outlet for fuel vapo r from the wipourizer 11.An air swirl device 21 is disposed in the top of tit space J5 to impart to air passing out of the space 15 via the hole 19 a strong swirling or vortex motion so that the mixing with fuel vapour passing out of the top of conduit 20 and through hole 19 is thorough and a relatively uniform mixture of air and fuel vapour is produced above i.e. downstream of the hole 19. The hole 19 is arranged to discharge swirling air from the space 15 and fuel vapour from the top of conduit 20 as a substantially uniform mixture into a burner head 23 having a suitable burner grid on in the illustrated embodiment the upper surface, so that during operation, the mixture of fuel vapour and air burns above the burner head 23 in an annular flame 24. A burner head and grid of the type used for burning gaseous fuel may be used. Preferably, the burner 10 is so constructed, arranged and controlled that the amount of air passed to the burner head 23 is between 80 and 120 of the requirement for complete combustion of the fuel vapour. . The vapourizer 11 comprises an upwardly extending riser 27 terminating at. its top at one side of a separating chamber 28 and a downcomer 26 which extends downwardly from the diametrically opposite side of the chamber 28, the bottom of the downcomer 26 curving smoothly downwards into cozmunication with a bottom region of the riser 27. The riser is of circular cross section, and a heating element 25 of circular cross section extends upwardly in the riser 27 from the closed bottom thereof to near the top, and defines therewith an annular clearance of small radial width e.g. 2,5mms. . The heating element 25 is heated by an internal electrical heating resistance no suppli d with el ic power from terminals B and wites F. Liq id fuel i supplied to the vapourizer 11 from the pipe 12 which has a substantially verti al part terminating at the lower end of the feed pipe 13.The latter is upwardly sloped at a small anglo to the iurizontal to prevent the passage of fuel v pour into pipe 13 and also to prevent the accum lation of high boiling components of fuel there. Tie upper end of the feed pipe is connected into tile riser 27 at just above the level at which the doncomer 26 communicates with the riser 27. For operation, liquid fuel, preferably boiling in the ranee 150 C to 4000C, is passed into the vapourizer 11 to the level L slightly below the bottom of the chamber 28 and preferably slightly below the top of the heating element 25, the level being regulated by the constant level tank. then electric power is supplied via the terminals E, the skin temperature of the heating clement 25 rises and liquid fuel in the narrow annular space between the element 25 and the surrounding riser wall is heated. The lighter fractions of the liquid fuel eventually begin to vapourize and bubbles of vapour form in the liquid in the riser 27 thereby reducing the overall density of the liquid thercin. The bubbles tend to rise in riser 27 and to promote an upward flow of liquid and vapourizec fuel in riser 27.With the passage of a short time, the narrow annulus containing fuel in the riser 27, particularly towards the top end, tends to contain a foam of fuel vapour bubbles in liquid fuel and the fuel circulates upwardly into the chamber 28 where the fuel vapour separates from the liquid fuel. Unvapourized fuel circulates to the top of the downcomer 26, and cool fuel from the bottom of the downcomer circulates into the bottom of the riser 27. The fuel vapour rises in the chamber 28, initially giving up heat of vapourization and sensible heat to the chamber 28 and circulating to the downeomer 26, but eventually passing out of the vapourizer 11 via the conduit 20 for admixture with swirling air and combustion of the resulting uniform mixture of air and fuel vapour at the burner head. Because the fuel vapour and air are mixed under tuibulent conditions, good mixing is achieved end the ttadency fo ual to be. deposited on the surfaces o the burner is reduccd even wilci the surfaces are cool. Moreover, the hold iip of fuel vapour in the burner is relatively small, and problems associated with ignition and flame stabiliation at burner staret up, and with fuel vapour emission to the atmosphere at burner shut down, are substantially climinated or relatively insignificant. Reference is now made to figure 2 from which it will be seen that the air swirl device comprises two co axial spaced apart annular metal plates 31 32 attached to each other by a plurality of angled flat blades 33 which extend from the outer to the inner edges of the plates 31, 32. The spaces between adjacerlt blades converge inwardly in a generally non radial, nontangential sense relative to the central orifices of the plates to define air pathways 34 to a cylindrical central zone inwardly of the blades 33. The central zone receives fuel vapour from the conduit 20 figure 1 e.g. via a plenum, not shown in figure 2 and air entering the central zone swirls therearound and mixes thoroughly with the fuel vapour to form a substantially uniform combustible mixture.The resulting mixture passes out of the top of the swirl device via a short duct 35. From figure 3, it will be seen that the lower plate 32 is slightly dished in a downward direction, and fuel vapour passes into the central zone via a plenum chamber 37. The arrangement of the blades is somewllat like that of a centrifugal impeller and in the central zone of the device, there is a relative depression of pressure along the axis thereof so that it is possible to adjust the pressure at the exit from conduit 20 to approximately atmospheric pressure. With reference to figures 3 and 4, it will be seen that the separation of the plates 31, 32 at their periphery by the blades 33 is by a distance h, the diameter of the central zone around which the blades 33 are disposed is d, and the blades are fixed at an augl. alpha to ad i from the t . of the al zone. In a ticula bediment of a burner of the type shown in figure 1 having a f el consu tion of 1 kg hr outpu of about 10 kW fitted withMecker type combustion grid of area 25 cm2 and having an air swirl device 21 of the type shown in figures 2, 3 and 4, the following characteristi s of the air swirl device were found to give satisfactory operations alpha 50 h 10 mm d 22 mm The foregoing data were obtained experimentally and are typical practical characteristics rather than optimum or unique values for satisfactory operation of the burner. The fuel employed had the following approximate properties speicific gavity 0.827 commat 10 C viscosity 3.60 cS commat 20 C distillation ASTM 10 vol. distilled 175 C 50 vol. distilled at 260 C 90 vol. distilled at 353 C The prior problems of fuel vapour condensation and flame instability at start up, fouling by fuel degradation products e.g. coke at locations upstream of the burner head necessitating burner shut down for cleaning, and the discharge of fuel vapour to atmosphere at butner shut down were found to be substatially eliminated. Reference is now made to the embodiment of figure 5 and 6 wherein parts common to the embodiment of figure 1 are given the same reference numerals. In figures 5 and 6, fuel vapour produced in the vapourizer not shown passes upwardly via conduit 20 into the central zone of the air swirl device 21 wherein it is mixed with swirling air cntering from the air sp 15 b tween the insulation and the outer casting 14. The resulting mixture of fuel vapour and air passes out of the hole 19 in the ho izontal top casing m mber 18 into a volute 40 which dir cts the mixture to a linear combustion grid 41 of any known or suitable type used in burning gaseous fuels at the outlet 42 of the volute 40. In addition to the benefits and advantages stated above, the symmetry of the principal parts of the burner about the central vertical axis enables the burner to be of simple and compact design and of relatively low cost. It will be appreciated that a feature or features shown or described in relation to one embodiment may be employed in another embodiment of the invention if technically feasible.
