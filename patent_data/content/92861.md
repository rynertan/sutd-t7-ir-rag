# Vibratory device and dental scaler incorporating it.

## Abstract
A vibratory device 10 , such as a dental scaler, in which an air driven rotor 60 is driven about a shaft 42 to impart vibrations thereto and drive a work tool 24 or other object attached to the shaft 42 . A support 30 is provided along the shaft 42 at a desired vibratory node and has sufficient non resilience to bias the shaft 42 into the desired mode of vibration. A water seal assembly 110 used in conjunction with the water transport means 106 is supported on the distal end of the shaft 42 at a location substantially the same as that of the support 30 .
