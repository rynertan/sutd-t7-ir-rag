# SUPPRESSED FUNDAMENTAL FREQUENCY THREE WAY PREDISTORTER

## Abstract
A suppressed fundamental frequency three way predis torter is provided which comprises a three way distributor circuit Y which distributes the input signal on three outputs 1, 2, 3 a distortion and fundamental suppression unit X connected to two outputs 1, 2 of the distributor circuit Y and comprising a distorter circuit D which generates distortion products in addition to the fundamental coming from one output 1 of the distribu tor circuit Y , an amplitude regulator B , a phase regulator C and an adder circuit ε 1 for adding signals with opposite phases to isolate the distortion products alone an amplitude regulator F and a phase regulator G for regulating amplitude and phase of the isolated distortion products alone a delay line LR connected to the third output 3 of the distributor circuit X and an adder circuit ε2 for addens the phase and amplitude regulated distortion products alone to the fundamental from the delay line LR .
