# A SOLAR RAY ENERGY COLLECTING DEVICE

## Abstract
A solar ray energy collecting device capable of effec tively separating and collecting only a light component of a desired wave length among the solar rays. The solar ray energy collecting device comprises light focusing lens being provided with a light intercepting member on the central part thereof, an optical conductor having a light receiving edge situated at the position of the lens focus, a reflector installed at the circumferential por tion of the optical conductor, and means for collecting ener gy of the light component reflected by the reflector.
