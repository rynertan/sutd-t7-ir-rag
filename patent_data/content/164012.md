# Apparatus and method for reading a two dimensional bar code.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to apparatus for reading a two dimensional bar code having bars located nominally at a predetermined pitch comprising means 20 for scanning the bar code with a plurality of spaced apart scan lines, means for generating for each scan line a sequence of ele ments of image data, recognition means 6 for recognising the bar code from the sequences of elements of image data, and transferring means 5 for selectively transferring the sequences of elements of image data to the recognition means 6 . Apparatus in accordance with the invention is charac terised in that the transferring means 5 comprises indica tor generating means 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 for generating for each of the sequences of elements of im age data an indicator representing the likelihood that the sequence represents the scanning of a portion of a bar, and profile vector constructing means 28 for constructing a plurality of profile vectors from selected ones of the indica tors. The apparatus also includes comparison means in the programmed logic array 35 for determining for each pro file vector which of the sequences of elements of image da ta, the indicators of which are used to construct the profile vector, represent the scanning of a portion of a bar and which of the sequences represent the scanning of a space between adjacent bars. The apparaturs further includes in the programmed logic array 35 means for selectively transferring to the recognition means 6 only those sequen ces of elements of image data which represent the scanning of a portion of a bar and disregarding all other sequences. The invention also relates to a method of reading a two dimensional bar code having bars located nominally at a predetermined pitch utilising apparatus as above.
