# Image providing apparatus and camera for forming a stereogram.

## Abstract
A photographic camera for providing a plurality of film images in order to produce a stereogram. The camera has a plurality of objectives which are independently adjustable so that the optical axes of the lenses can be made substantially parallel in a first plane. The objectives have substantially the same focal length and common shutter, aperture and focal control. The camera may include a film magazine having a film advance equal to the number of objectives. Placed between the lenses and the film is a film plate 67 having a plurality of spaced image transmitting openings 68 73 having their centers lying in a first plane, the openings being symmetrically disposed about a second plane orthogonal to the first plane. The widths of the openings 68 73 measured in the first plane increase with the distance of the opening from the second plane.
