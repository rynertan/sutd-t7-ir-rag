# Heart valve prosthesis.

## Abstract
The prosthesis comprises an annular frame 1 and a disc shaped obturator 3 which is coupled to the frame 1 and is pivotable, under the action of the blood flow, between an open angular position A and a closed angular position 8 , so as to allow the flow of blood through the aperture 1a of the annular frame 1 in one direction and the interruption of the flow in the opposite direction, respectively. The obturator 3 is coupled to the frame 1 in such a way that, in the open position A , it may orient itself in a direction substantially perpendicular to the plane of the frame 1 . The side of the obturator 3 which faces away from the central axis 1b of the annular frame 1 in the open angular position A is defined, at least in its peripheral part, by a surface 3c 13c 23c which is generated by the rotation, about the central axis 3a of the obturator 3 , of a curve the locus of the centres of curvature of which lies on the opposite side of this curve from a curve which generates, by rotation around the said central axis 3a , a surface defining the other side of the obturator 3 .
