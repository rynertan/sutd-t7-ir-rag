# Melt fusible polyimides.

## Abstract
Melt fusible polyimides based on pyromellitic dianhydride and at least one defined aromatic diamine are useful in making low void composites and thermoplastic tapes, which can be fabricated into articles such as, for example, aircraft and auto body panels, printed circuit boards, etc. Some of these poly imides are melt processible and can be fabricated by conven tional procedures such as extrusion and injection molding.
