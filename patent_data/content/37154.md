# Process for inserting gold dot in electrical terminals.

## Abstract
Gold dots 22 are punched from a plated gold strip 24 , inserted into a prepared hole 18 in a solder coated electrical terminal contact area 10 . Heat is applied to the terminal 10 to reflow the solder 30 and seal the interface 16 between the dot and the terminal hole.

## Description
Title PROCESS FOR INSERTING GOLD DOT IN ELECTRICAL TEDIINALS Background of the Invention Field of the Invention This invention relates to a method of inserting a first metal structure into a second metal structure. More specifically, it refers to a process of inserting a gold dot into the contact area of an electrical terminal. Description of the Prior Art The need to keep electrical contact areas free from corrosive effects limits the number of metals useful in these contact areas. The preferred metal for high quality contacts is gold. xnfortunately the high cost of gold is a severe limitation to its use. Methods have been developed to restrict the use of gold to a minimum by employing gold only in the contact areas of terminals. Heretofore, the gold has been applied as a ,drop or a stripe in the contact surface area. The drop method usually applies about .001 of gold in the contact area. However only about 30 microinches is needed. Stripes can be plated onto contact areas of terminals at a 30 microinch thickness but the equipment to perform this operation is not cost effective. Moreover plated stripes are wasteful of gold when electrical terminal configuration requires large spaces between contact points. A cost effective method is needed to create a contact surface on a terminal having only 30 microinches of gold. Summary of the Invention In accordance with this invention I have discovered a simple, cost effective method of placing about 30 microinches of gold on terminal contact zones. The method involves plating a strip of electrically conductive metal such as berrylium copper, copper, bronze or phosphor bronze with a layer of about 30 microinches of gold. Conventional plating techniques can be used. Subsequently a terminal base material made from a conductive metal such as berrylium copper, copper, bronze or phosphor bronze is stamped by conventional methods to form terminals on a carrier strip. Included in this stamping is a hole punched out in the proposed terminal contact zone. A layer of solder is plated to the surface of the terminals either before or subsequent to the stamping step.A dot is punched from the gold plated strip of metal and this dot is inserted by the punch into the hole in the terminal contact zone. Heat is thereafter applied to the terminal strip to reflow the solder and seal the interface between the dot and the terminal hole. Brier Description of the Drawinqs FIG. 1 is a cross sectional view of the gold dot inserted into a hole on a terminal contact zone. FIG. 2 is a perspective view of the gold dot being punched from a plated metal strip. FIG. 3 is a perspective view of the gold dot being inserted into the hole on a terminal carrier strip. Description of the Preferred Embodiments The invention comprises a method of inserting a gold dot 22 punched from a plated strip 24 of a conductive metal base material into a hole 18 prepunched from a terminal strip 28. Any of the conventional gold plating methods such as described in U.S. Patent 3,427,231 could be used to plate the strip 24 with a thin layer of gold 12. The gold should be preferably at least 18 karats. The plated strip 24, having a layer of gold 12, about 30 microinches thick over a bronze, phosphor bronze, copper or berrylium copper substrate is struck with a punch 20. A support 26 pushes the cut disk 22 away from the strip 24. The diameter of the punched disk will coincide with the diameter of the hole 18 punched from the terminal 10. The terminal carrier strip 28 has a series of terminals 10 stamped at the same time that the hole 18 is punched out. The strip 24 is fetd into the die and the disk 22 is simultaneously punched from the strip 24 and inserted into the hole 18 in a terminal 10. The disk 22 is held in the hole 18 by an interference fit. Additional pressure is exerted to effect a cold weld between the disk 22 and the terminal 10. Heat may also be applied to promote a bond by diffusion, brazing or soldering. In the preferred embodiment the surface of terminal 10 is coated with solder 30. After inserting the disk 22 into the hole 18, the terminal 10 is heated above the melting point of the solder to cause a flow of solder to move into the joint 16 between the disk 22 and the terminal 10. See FIG. 1 This insures a firm seal under most stress conditions encountered by a terminal contact area. Gold plating from the scrap terminal carrier strip 28 can be recovered by conventional means. The terminals can be used in high quality electrical devices requiring continuous electrical contact without formation of oxides which lower contact efficiency. Typical devices include computers and military electronic equipment.
