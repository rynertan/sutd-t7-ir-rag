# An improved composition for a lightweight cement slurry for cementing oil and gas wells.

## Abstract
A lightweight cement slurry composition having a den sity in the range of 1.2 to 1.6, Containing a solid extender agent and an SBR latex. The ratio of the liquid volume to the slurry volume should be less than 70 and preferably less than 63 . The lightweight slurry then presents a most attractive set of properties which could not be obtained previously, and in particular gas channelling is controlled.
