## Description
This invention relates to the manufacture of electronic devices such as integrated circuits. Particularly, this invention relates to improved semiconductor substrate materials, such as silicon wafers, used in the manufacture of integrated circuit devices. Specifically, this invention is directed to semiconductor substrate materials having enhanced ability for the gettering of deleterious impurities, contaminants and defects away from the region of device formation, during device manufacture. In the manufacture of integrated circuit devices on silicon wafers, the presence of and introduction of defects, contaminants and impurities on and near the device formation surface of the wafer creates excessive current leakages which greatly affect the yield of usable devices obtained. The art has recognized that to some extent the deleterious defects, contaminants and impurities can be relocated to non harmful regions in the substrate material away from the device formation region. The methods and processes for diffusing and trapping the defects, contaminants and impurities away from the active device region both prior to and during device formation are termed gettering in the electronics industry and art. Several techniques and processes for gettering in semiconductor materials to improve device yields have been disclosed in the art. Known gettering techniques and processes for semiconductor materials can be generally classified as being based on external or internal means. External gettering involves modifying the backside surface of the wafer to provide sites to which the defects, contaminants and impurities are attracted. A present commercially used external gettering technique is to impart mechanical damage to the backside of the wafer. The mechanical damage is imparted to the backside of the wafer by scratching the surface or sanding or grinding with an abrasive means to alter the crystalline structure and produce imperfections which attract and trap defects, contaminants and impurities away from the active device region of the wafer. Although backside damaged wafers provide gettering, the damage to the wafer creates additional problems in fragility, handling and cleaning to remove particulates formed and the damaged area provides potential traps for holding fluids and materials employed in the device manufacturing process which can result in further wafer contamination. U.S. Patent 4,144,099 describes wafer gettering by employing backside mechanical damage. Another example of external gettering is described in U.S. Patent 3,997,368 wherein a stressed layer of silicon nitride or aluminum oxide is formed on the backside of the wafer, which is then annealed to cause stacking fault nucleation sites to diffuse to the backside. Still another example is described in U.S. Patent 3,929,529 wherein a surface of the wafer is anodized to form a layer of porous silicon, the contaminants are diffused from the body of the wafer to the porous silicon and the porous silicon layer is then oxidized to silicon dioxide U.S. Patent 4,053,335 equivalent to FR A 2346856 discloses a means of external gettering in semiconductor materials by providing a layer of polysilicon on the backside of the wafer. The grain boundaries of the polysilicon provide sites for the segregation of impurities from the substrate. As the polysilicon grain boundaries are not annealed out at high temperature, the gettering capabilities remain effective throughout high temperature processing used in device manufacture. Other commonly employed external type gettering means utilize boron or phosphorus doped semiconductor materials, ion implantation, such as argon, or heavy diffusion of impurities, such as boron and phosphorus, into the substrate material. U.S. Patent 3,874,936 provides a description of the latter technique. More recently, the gettering effect of oxygen contained in the substrate material has been reported in Solid State Technology , July 1981, pages 55 61, and is referred to as internal gettering. Oxygen is present in Czochralski grown silicon as it is introduced into the crystal from the dissolution of the quartz crucible employed to hold the silicon melt during crystal pulling. The precipitation of oxygen contained in the substrate material can form useful sites for gettering deleterious defects, contaminants and impurities. With any gettering means, the active region of the substrate material where the devices are formed must be free of gettering sites. Thus, a zone about 5 25 microns and preferably about 10 20 microns in depth from the device surface of the wafer which is denuded of gettering sites must be created to prevent device yield loss from defect interference. The oxygen concentration in a substrate material can be reduced near the surface through outward diffusion under the process thermal conditions employed in device manufacture. With the rapidly advancing device manufacturing technology and particularly with respect to complex and lengthy processing steps and increased circuit density and total circuit size on a wafer, it has become apparent that improvements are needed in the gettering capabilities of substrates to cope with the increased requirements and provide effective gettering throughout the device processing steps in order to achieve an acceptable yield of good devices per wafer. Typical objects of this invention are to provide Other objects, characteristics and advantages of this invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure and appended claims. In accordance with this invention, an improved semiconductor substrate is provided which exhibits enhanced gettering capabilities throughout device manufacturing cycles, imparts improved minority carrier lifetime and reduces yield loss of devices made due to deleterious defects, contaminants and impurities. The enhanced gettering capabilities are imparted to the semiconductor wafer by applying a gettering layer to the backside of the wafer. The enhanced gettering capabilities of the semiconductor wafer are further improved when the layer of polysilicon on the backside of the wafer has oxygen added to it. It has been found that the external polysilicon layer although reducing the depth of the oxygen denuded zone obtained in the wafer enhances the oxygen precipitation providing an unexpected increase in sites for gettering of impurities and an unexpected increase in minority carrier lifetime as a function of the temperatures employed in a particular device manufacturing process. The thickness of the polysilicon layer effectively controls the depth of the oxygen denuded zone formed and the degree of oxygen precipitated in the wafer. Thus, the thickness of the polysilicon layer provides a determinant for providing a sufficiently deep oxygen denuded zone and increased oxygen precipitation for effective gettering, as a function of the temperatures employed in the device manufacturing processes, with the resultant increase in device yield. The synergistic gettering effect provided by the polysilicon layer is achieved when device processing temperatures do not go beyond about 1025 C. or, at least, go beyond about 1025 C. only for a sufficient period of time until the desired denuded zone is depleted of oxygen. At processing temperatures greater than 1025 C., the oxygen in the wafer generally remains in solution and does not tend to precipitate. Oxygen doped polysilicon is referred to in the electronics industry as SIPOS semi insulating polycrystalline silicon . Thermally deposited SIPOS has been used as passivation films on devices and has received considerable attention in the literature. An early article Semi Insulating Polycrystalline Silicon SIPOS Films Applied To MOS Integrated Circuits by H. Mochizuki et al in the supplement to SIPOS is deposited on semiconductor substrate materials, such as silicon wafers, by the well known chemical vapor deposition CVD technology, wherein the reactant in vapor form is thermally decomposed or is reduced using hydrogen or other known reducing agents. SIPOS is deposited by using a reactant in the form of a silicon containing material, such as silane or a chlorinated silicon such as trichlorosilane, and an oxygen containing material. The oxygen containing material can be a non metallic oxygen containing complex such as oxides of nitrogen, carbon and hydrogen, and oxidizing agents such as a phosgene as well as oxygen itself. The oxygen content of the deposited SIPOS film can be regulated by controlling the ratios of the silicon and oxygen in the reactant gas. A polysilicon doped or undoped layer on the wafer creates a strain resulting in a degree of bow or warpage in the wafer. The level of strain introduced is in part dependent upon the temperature at which the polysilicon layer is applied, the oxygen content of the layer, and the deposition pressure and rate. Suitable doped polysilicon layers for the purpose of this invention can be deposited onto the wafers at temperatures generally within the range of 600 to 800 C. Polysilicon deposition occurs at lower temperatures, but at about 600 C. the deposition is too slow to be economically practical. Deposition can also occur at higher temperatures, but at about 800 C. the grain size of the polysilicon tends to become too large for effective gettering or control problems can occur, particularly when using silane as a reactant. The effect of the level of oxygen doping of the polysilicon layer on the strain introduced and the resulting bow warpage varies with the deposition conditions employed. Temperatures in the range of about 680 C. 700 C. are found to introduce the least strain into the wafer. Bow and warpage of the wafer is also proportional to the polysilicon layer thickness. In accordance with this invention, effective gettering is obtained utilizing various thicknesses of doped polysilicon layers on the backside of the substrate materials. Generally, the layer thickness can range broadly from 0.05 to 5.0 microns, preferably from 0.2 to 2.0 microns, and more specifically from 0.6 to 1.0 micron. The dopant concentration in the layer can also vary over a broad range while achieving gettering capability. Generally dopant concentrations can broadly range from 0.1 to 40 weight percent, preferably from 2 to 20 weight percent, and more specifically from 4 to 10 weight percent. In the following Examples, a low pressure chemical vapor deposition LPCVD reactor of the type described in articles by M. L. Hitchman and J. Kane in the Silicon wafers which have been lapped and chemically etched by conventional commercial technology are used. Polysilicon or SIPOS layers are deposited on both sides of the wafers in the reactor, although it is to be understood that deposition of doped polysilicon only on one side of the wafer is sufficient for purposes of this invention. The thickness of the doped polysilicon layers deposited on the wafers is controlled by regulating the deposition time in the reactor. Under the conditions employed using 7.62 cm. wafers, a 0.8 micron thick undoped polysilicon layer is deposited in 35 minutes and a 1.5 micron thick layer is deposited in 65 minutes, whereas a 0.8 micron thick SIPOS layer is deposited in 48 minutes and a 1.5 micron thick layer is deposited in 91 minutes. The wafers after removal from the furnace are further processed using conventional technology. The deposited doped polysilicon layers are polished off the front side of the wafers leaving a doped polysilicon layer on the backside of the wafer. The depth of the oxygen denuded zone formed in the wafers after being subjected to simulated device temperature cycles is measured by lapping and polishing an edge of the wafer at a shallow angle of about 11 19 to provide a test surface approximately 1 cm. in length. The polished surface is then Wright etched. Under a 100X microscope the distance L from the top level of the prepared surface to the closest precipitate is measured. The denuded zone depth DZ is calculated as equal to L sin d where is the angle of bevel and d is the thickness of the top surface removed by the Wright etch. MOS capacitors are prepared on the candidate wafers which have been cleaned by standard techniques. A 1,000 A thick oxide surface layer on each wafer is formed by loading the wafers into a furnace at 800 C at 15.24 cm. per minute in an N₂ 10 O₂ atmosphere, raising the temperature to 1,000 C. at 10 per minute, oxidizing in dry oxygen for 130 minutes, annealling in nitrogen for 30 minutes, reducing the temperature at 1 C. per minute to 600 C. in a nitrogen atmosphere, annealing in the presence of the forming gas for 30 minutes at 600 C. and removing from the furnace at 15.24 cm. per minute. Capacitors are formed by conventional aluminum evaporation and photolithographic techniques. MOS lifetimes are determined from capacitance measurements as a function of time after depleting the device with an electrical pulse using the well known method of M. Zerbest Z. Agnew Physics, 22, 30 1966 . MOS capacitors are formed on a number of silicon wafers either having a polysilicon or a SIPOS layer on the backside prepared as described above under conditions set forth in Table 1 and standard wafers, as control. MOS generation lifetimes are determined as described above and the average of the results for like test wafers are reported in Table 1. From the above data it is seen that generation lifetime increases as the thickness of the SIPOS layer and oxygen content increase and is more than double that obtained with only a polysilicon layer. Wafers having varying oxygen content SIPOS layers applied to the backside are prepared to demonstrate that the amount of oxygen in the SIPOS layer has an effect on, and can be used to control, wafer distortion known as bow. Bow is simply the deviation of the wafer from flatness in the unclamped state, without holding the wafer on a vacuum chunk. Bow is measured by supporting the wafer on 3 points near the edge of the back and measuring the position of the center of the front of the wafer. The wafer is then turned over and the change in elevation of the center of the wafer is noted. The value of the change divided by two is known as the bow of the wafer. If the polished side is concave, the wafer is known as dished and if it is convex the wafer is called a bowed wafer. The SIPOS layers are applied to the silicon wafers using the reactor as described above. The temperatures along the reactor range from 624 C. at the door to 655 C. in the middle and 695 C. at the pump end. Sample wafers were placed at positions where the above temperatures were measured in order to obtain a variety of oxygen compositions, since the oxygen uptake of nitrous oxide versus the silane are different. A constant feed rate of 80 cc min. of silane is provided. The difference in oxygen uptake occurs since the silane and nitrous oxide deplete at different rates. The actual layer compositions were determined analytically using an electron microprobe, by measuring the X rays emitted when the sample was excited with an electron beam. The energy of the electron beam was kept low so that the electron penetration, throughout the analysis, was limited to the SIPOS deposited layer. The conditions used and the results of these procedures are given in Table II. The results indicate the effect of oxygen content on inducing bow in the wafer as well as the quantity of oxygen on the type of bow. Thus, the oxygen content can be regulated to control bow of the wafer. The above Examples used standard P 100 type silicon wafers. However, polysilicon layers on any crystalline P or N type wafer provide improved gettering of deleterious defects, contaminants and impurities. Typical gettering improvements from polysilicon backside layers as indicated by generation lifetime will be at least about 4 times that of standard P 100 type wafers and at least about 1.5 times that of standard P 111 type wafers. This invention, in addition to providing the electronics industry with an improved semiconductor substrate, permits control of semiconductor substrate characteristics such as denuded zone depth and oxygen precipitation through polysilicon backside layer thickness in relation to the specific requirements dictated by downstream needs and manufacturing conditions, such as particular device requirements and processing temperatures.
