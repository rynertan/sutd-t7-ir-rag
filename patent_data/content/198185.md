# URETHANE COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING PREFORMED ADDUCTS

## Abstract
Urethane compositions are prepared which contain preformed adducts. The preformed adducts are prepared by reacting a polyisocyanate with various polyols or amine analogs thereof whereby a product insoluble in the urethane prepolymer is produced. An intermediate polyol is added to produce a prepolymer. The cured urethane compositions have high low strain modulus.
