# Method of manufacturing sintered ceramic body.

## Abstract
A method of sintering a ceramic body, has the steps of preparing a composition containing a binder and a ceramic powder having a particle size distribution given such that 0 to 1 weight of ceramic particles with an average particle size of less than 0.2 µm, 0 to 2 weight of ceramic particles with an average particle size of 0.2 µm to less than 0.5 µm, 5 to 15 weight of ceramic particles with an average particle size of 0.5 µm to less than 1.0 µm. 5 to 15 weight of ceramic parti cles with an average particle size of 1.0 µm to less than 1.5 µm, 5 to 15 weight of ceramic particles with an average particle size of 1.5 µm to less than 2.0 um, and 50 to 80 weight of ce ramic particles of not less than 2.0 µm, the binder being con tained in the amount of 15 to 25 weight of the total weight of the composition, injection molding the composition into a pre determined shape to obtain a molded body, removing the binder from the molded body by heating, and sintering the molded body which is free from the binder. Since packing pro perties of the ceramic powder can be improved, the amount of binder to be used can be decreased. The density of the resul tant sintered body can be improved, and the contraction per centage of the sintered body can be decreased. A complicated sintered body can be fabricatetd with high precision.
