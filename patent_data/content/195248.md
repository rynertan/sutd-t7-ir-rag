# HIGH INTENSITY DISCHARGE LAMP STARTING AND OPERATING APPARATUS

## Abstract
Starting and operating apparatus for high intensity discharge lamps includes first and second pairs of terminals formed for connection to an AC source and a discharge lamp respectively, a series connect ballast means and inductor connected to one of said first pair and one of said second pair of terminals a bilateral switch shunted by a capacitor and in series with an AC impedance coupled to the inductor and to the other one of said first and second pair of terminals whereby relatively wide high voltage, high frequency pulse potentials for starting the discharge lamps are provided.
