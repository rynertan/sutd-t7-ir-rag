# WEB GUIDE WITH VEE BEARING

## Abstract
The web guide apparatus of the present invention includes a sationary tilt roller support frame, a pivotal tilt roller support means and an inlet tilt roller. A web of material travelling in a direction generally perpendicular to the tilt roller is guided by arcuately pivoting the tilt roller with respect to the direction of travel of the web. The pivotal frame of the apparatus is supported upon the stationary frame by means of a rolling engagement bearing carriage. The center about which the tilt roller is pivoted, known as the origin of radius, lies on the line defined by the inlet edge of the inlet tilt roller.
