# Swaging apparatus having elastically deformable members.

## Abstract
A swaging apparatus includes a mandrel 18 to be insert ed in a tube 16 that is to be expanded radially. A pair of seals 22, 24 define the axial boundaries of an annular pressure zone 28 between the mandrel 18 and the tube 16 . Each seal includes a support 38 formed by a plurality of arcuate seg ments elastically held together by a ring 40 and presenting a cam surface 50 . An annular cam member 52 interacts with the cam surface 50 to expand the support radially in response to swaging pressure in the pressure zone 28 , thereby prevent ing inelastic deformation of an elastic seal member 36 on the high pressure side of the support 38 .
