## Description
SILICONE ANTI FOAMING COMPOSITIONS Background of the Invention The present invention is concerned with a composite silicone anti foaming agent. In particular, the present invention is concerned with a composite anti foaming agent which has an excellent anti foaming effect which is continuously maintained, particularly in systems which are vigorously agitated and or in alkaline solutions. Conventional silicone anti foaming agents, because they exhibit excellent anti foaming effects in small quantities compared to non silicone anti foaming agents, such as alcohols, esters, mineral oils, vegetable oils and synthetic oils, etc., are widely employed for the purposes of suppressing and breaking up foam in waste water, dyeing processes, fermentation processes, latexes, cements, paints, adhesives, petroleum processes, etc. However, silicon anti foaming agents are defective in that the continuity of the anti foaming effect is tremendously lowered in alkaline systems, such as in the pulp digesting process in the pulp paper manufacturing industry, and in systems where vigorous stirring takes place, such as in gas extraction tanks at waste water treatment plants or in jet dyeing.It is, therefore, necessary to supplement the anti foaming agent, either continuously or intermittantly.Since this is extremely uneconomical, the industries concerned desire an anti foaming agent with an improved, continuous anti foaming effect. Among the techniques for improving the defects above, the following substances have been suggested 1 diinethyldichlorosilane JapanesePatent Number Sho 52 31836 2 silica treated with organic silicone compounds containing nitrogen and dispersed in organopolysiloxane oil JapanesePatent Number Sho 51 35556 3 anti foaming agents composed of amino functional silicone compounds, phosphorus bulking agents in the shape of flakes, finely powdered metallic oxides, and organopolysiloxane oils Japanese Patent Number Sho 52 41184 . However, the agents of references 1 and 2 require a long time to form hydrophobic silica. In addition, since complex treatment processes are necessary, they are uneconomical.The agent of reference 3 has an excellent immediate effect but, since some kinds of metallic oxides and flakes phosphorus bulking agents have large granules with large specific gravities, it is easy for them to settle out and separate during operation. These agents are defective even when they are employed in systems which generate foam,Since they settle out and cannot be said to demonstrate a completely satisfactory anti foaming effect. Besides these kinds of defects, the anti foaming agents of references 1 , 2 , and 3 described above cannot be said to be completely satisfactory since they do not always continuously maintain their anti foaming effectiveness. Brief Summary of the Invention It is an object of this invention to provide an anti foaming agent which does not suffer from one or more of the above described defects of the anti foaming agents of the art. It is another object of this invention to provide an anti foaming agent which maintains its effect continuously. It is a further obJect of this invention to provide an anti foaming agent which is continuously effective in an alkaline medium. It is also an object of this invention to provide an anti foaming agent which is continuously effective in an agitated medium. These objects, and others which will be obvious when considering the following disclosure and appended claims, are realized by the compositions of this invention which are prepared by forming a mixture of a hydrophobic oil, a silicone having silicon bonded hydrogen atoms, a finely divided silica and optionally, a catalyst for the reaction of silicon bonded hydrogen atoms with silicon bonded hydroxyl radicals. Detailed Description of the Invention The present invention relates to an anti foaming agent obtained by mixing A 100 parts by weight of a hydrophobic oil selected from the group consisting of organopolysiloxane oils, and hydrocarbon oils, B 0.1 to 100 parts by weight of an organohydroyenpolysiloxane, C 1 to 50 parts by weight of a finely divided silica, and D 0 to 5 parts by weight of a catalyst for the reaction of silicon bonded hydrogen atoms with silicon bonded hydroxyl radicals. The hydrophobic oil A can be any oil which is liquid at room temperature and which is selected from the group consisting of organopolysiloxane oils, hydrocarbon oils or mixtures of the two types of oils. The organopolysiloxane oils are typically represented by the average formula RaSiO 4 a 2, wherein R denotes any monovalent hydrocarbon radical such as alkyl radicals, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, or hexyl cycloaliphatic radicals, such as cyclohexyl aryl radicals, such as phenyl and tolyl and aralkyl radicals, such as benzyl.Preferably, R has less then 7 carbon atoms and a has a value of from 1.9 to 2.1, both inclusive. Examples of suitable organopolysiloxane oils include poly dimethylsiloxane , poly methylphenylsiloxane , poly methylethylsiloxane , poly diethylsiloxane , poly ethylphenylsiloxane , etc. From the points of view of anti foaming effectiveness and of economics, poly dimethylsiloxane oil is highly preferred. The terminal portions of the organopolysiloxane oil polynier chains can be hydroxyl groups and or triorganosilyl groups, such as trimethylsilyl groups. A trimethylsilyl endblocked poly dimethylsiloxane having the formula CH3 3Sio CH3 2Sio nSi CH3 3, wherein n has a value sufficient to provide the desired viscosity for the organopolysiloxane, is a most preferred organopolysiloxane oil component A . It is sufficient that the viscosity of the organopolysiloxane oil be that of a liquid at normal temperatures however, from the standpoint of ease of manageability and anti foaming effectiveness, it is desirable that said viscosity should be within the range of 50 10,000 centistokes at 25 C. As the hydrocarbon oil, it is permissible to use aliphatic hydrocarbon oils, arornatic hydrocarbon oils, or alicyclic hydrocarbon oils. The hydrocarbon oils that are used should have viscosities corresponding to that of the previously described organopolysiloxane oil. In cases where a mixture of organopolysiloxane oil and hydrocarbon oil is employed, the mixing proportions have no particular limitations and may be done as desired. There may be cases where only extremely small amounts of one oil are added to the other oil. The organohydrogenpolysiloxane which is employed as component B in the present invention is exemplified by having at least one Si H group in each molecule. The organic radicals in this component are those delineated above for R in component A . Most preferably, component B is a methylhydrogenpolysiloxane having at least one Si H group on each molecule. The organohydrogenpolysiloxane can have any molecular form such as straight chains, rings, and branched chains, as long as they are in liquid form at normal temperatures.There are no special limitations as to the viscosity of the organohydrogenpolysiloxane but from the point of view of easy processability and reactivity with the hydroxyl groups of finely divided silica, delineated below, it is preferred that organohydrogenpolysiloxanes be used which have a viscosity below 1000 centistokes, most preferably below 100 centistokes at 25 C. Component B is preferably a trimethylsilyl endblocked poly methylhydroyensiloxane having the formula CH3 3SiO CH3 H SiO1nSi CH3 3 wherein n has a value sufficient to provide the desired viscosity for the methylhydrogenpolysiloxane. There are no critical limitations on the amount of organohydrogenpolysiloxane which is used to form the compositions of this invention, since it varies according to the molecular weight of the organohydrogenpolysiloxane, the average number ofSi H groups which are found in each molecule, and the mixed in amount of finely divided silica.Normally, however, 0.1 100 parts by weight of component B is used for every 100 parts by weight of component A . Normally, 10 200 parts by weight is used for every 100 parts by weight of the finely divided silica component C . Although it is desirable from the point of view of anti foaming effectiveness that substances with a surface area above 100 m2 g be used as the finely divided silica in the present invention, there are no special limitations. The following are examples of suitable finely divided silica fumed silica, silica aerogel, precipitated silica, quartz dust, fused silica, and pyrogenic silica.It is also possible to use silicas which have had their surfaces treated, such as with organosilanes, organosilazanes, organic compounds, inorganic compounds, etc., so long as the functional groups on the surface thereof, such as hydroxyl groups, etc., remain to react with Si H groups. Since the amount of finely divided silica which is added influences the anti foaming effectiveness unsatisfactorily if too much or too little is added, 1 50 parts by weight, preferably 3 20 parts by weight, is the range of silica to be used for every 100 parts by weight of component A . Although the catalyst employed in the present invention as component D is not a necessary component, it has the effect of accelerating the dehydrogenation reaction of theSi H groups of the organohydrogenpolysiloxane with, for example, the hydroxyl groups on the silica surface. Some examples of these catalysts are tin dibutyl diacetate, tin dibutyl dilaurate, tin dibutyl dioctoate, lead octoate, iron octoate, zinc octoate, etc. The composite anti foaming agent of the present invention can be obtained by mixing together components A C or by mixing together components A D . It is desirable when mixing the components that stirring take place for 2 3 hours at 120 2000C. It is desirable that the mixing device be able to mix and heat at the same time. In addition, in order to blend or homogenize this composition, it is permissible to treat it with homogenizers, ball mills, colloid mills, tri rollers, etc. Depending on the situation, it is also permissible to use inert gases such as nitrogen, etc., during said mixing and or heating.It is possible to employ any device needed in performing the mixing, so long as homogenization takes place. There are no special limitations as to what order should be used in said mixing. For example, it is possible to adopt the following methods 1 The method of mixing components A C or components A D simultaneously. 2 The method of mixing component A with component C to produce a silicone compound, then adding component B , or component B and component D to the mix. 3 The method of mixing component A and component B to produce a liquid mixture, then mixing in component C , or component C and component D . 4 The method of mixing component B and component C , or cornponents B D beforehand and treating with silica dust and then mixing component A into the treated silica. 5 Carrying out the mixing described in 1 4 with an organic solvent. 6 The method of emulsification by adding water to the mixtures obtained by methods 1 4 described above in the presence of a surfactant, or by adding water and a surfactant to the mixtures produced in methods 1 4 . Although it is permissible to select freely from methods 1 6 , depending on the purpose for which it will be employed, the methods of mixing are not restricted to the met nods described above. While not wishing to limit this invention by theory we believe that the excellent continuous anti foaming effectiveness of the present composition results from the bonding of the organohydrogenpolysiloxane to the silica surface, due to the dehydrogenation reaction of Si H groups with the hydroxyl groups of the silica. The composite anti foaming agent of the present invention can be employed in various forms, depending on the foam generating system to be treated. For example, it is possible to use dilution by means of an organic solvent, which is presented in mixing method 5 described above, in cases where the foam generating system is an oil system or a solvent system. The organic solvent mentioned here can be selected from among liquid, conventional, well known solvents with boiling points below 250 C, such as hydrocarbon solvents, halogenated hydrocarbons, amines, alcohols, esters, ketones, ethers, and acids. The following is an incomplete list of examples methylcyclohexane, xylene, petroleum naphtha, perchloroethylene, bromochloroethane, dichlorobutane, triethylamine, butylamine, tributylamine, isopropyl alcohol, butyl alcohol, amyl alcohol, hexyl ether, butylCellosolve, dioxane, methyl ethyl ketone, diethyl ketone, methyl butyl ketone, esters of acetic acid,Cellosolve acetate, propionic acid esters, acetic acid, propionic acid, or 2 ethylhexanoic acid. In addition, when the foam generating system is a water system, this composite substance can be emulsified using a well known surfactant and water as in method 6 and to use it in emulsified form. Although the following surfactants may be thus employed, the surfactants which may be used are not limited to these sorbitan fatty acid esters propylene glycol fatty acid esters polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters polyoxyethylene alkylethers polyoxyethylene castor oil ethylene oxide and propylene oxide additives etc. At the time of emulsification, it is permissible to use a protective colloid which has the effect of increasing viscosity, raising the stability, dispersibility, or cohesiveness.For example, methyl cellulose, milk sugar, sodium alyinate, cane sugar fatty acid esters, tragacanth gum, polyvinyl alcohol, hydroxypropyl cellulose, carboxyvinyl polymers, etc., may be used. In addition, the surfactants and protective colloids described above may be used in this composite substance as powdered anti foaming agents. Besides the organic solvents, water, surfactants, and protective colloids which are described above, it is possible to mix the following substances into the compositions of the present invention soy bean oil, vegetable oils, peanut oils, coconut oils, polyethers, carboxylic acid esters, phosphoric acid esters, perfluorocarbons, chlorinated aromatic groups, lauric acids, polyalkylene glycol, organosilanes, organosilazanes, aluminum hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, powdered metallic oxide substances, fla e type phosphorus bulking agents, organosilicon compounds which contain amino functional groups, etc. Next, examples of the present invention, and comparative examples, will be shown.
