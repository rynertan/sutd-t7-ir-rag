## Description
METHOD OF STARTING AND OPERATING A GAS DISCHARGE LAMP, ANDPOWER SUPPLY AND ELECTRONIC BALLAST THEREFORThis invention relates to an electronic ballast and to an electronic starter for a gas discharge tube, e.g. a fluorescent tube. More particularly, the invention is concerned with improvements in or relating to an electronic power supply circuit including an inverter,and possibly a rectifier if powered by an AC supply, operating at high frequency for driving a gas tube or lamp as well as an electronic starter for use with such a circuit.Electronic power supplies for driving a gas discharge lamp or tube at a frequency sufficiently high for the lamp to operate in a linear resistance mode are known e.g. PCT applications WO 83 587 and WO 81 03182 SIEMENS, which use an integrated circuit chip to control the frequency, and US 3 328 721 Hehenkamp, 442 852 Zadarej, 4 215 292 Inue et al, 4 277 726 Burke, 4 289 993 Harper et al, 4 36 171 Kaneda and 4 392 85 Knoll et al. In these circuits thelamnis provided in a series or parallel resonant circuit including an inductance and a capacitance element with the inverter driving the lamp circuit at a frequency different from the resonant frequency to control the current and voltage of the lamp.It is also known to use circuits of the chopper type to control the lamp current or voltage by varying the width of each driving pulse to the lamp,e.g. US 4 42 856Stiegerwald and Dutch patent 76 00156 Siemens. These circuits it is believed, suffer from one or more disadvantages, such as, they have a low power factor, and or they provide undesirable harmonic feedback into the supply line, or provide radio interference noise, or they are expensive.Circuits of the type mentioned above also have starting circuits. One type, e.g. WO 83 587 and EPC 0 56 642 uses a timer to allow a heating current to be applied to the lamp elements for a fixed period before starting the inverter and supplying full voltage and current to the lamp. Another type uses a current limiting device, usually a resistor, in parallel with a by pass circuit to allow full voltage and current to be applied to the lamp via the inverter. The bypass circuit may be controlled by a thermistor temperature dependant resistor e.g. US 3 328 721 and US 4 36 177 or it may be time interval controlled with the voltage increasing steadily, e.g. US 4 277 726, or it may provide a boosted, striking or starting voltage after a predetermined time interval, e.g.US 4 42 852. Some problems with these devices are that a high voltage may be suddenly applied to the invention which can damage the components, the high starting voltage is applied to the lamp terminals regardless of whether a lamp is present or not, and the running voltage is still present at the lamp terminals when the lamp is removed.One object of this invention is to provide an electronic power supply including an inverter which is capable of providing a high power factor, ensures a satisfactory tube life and is suitable for minimising harmonic feedback to anAC supply.Another object of the invention is to provide a starting circuit for a gas discharge lamp which satisfactorily minimises the disadvantages mentioned above.According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a method of operating a gas discharge lamp including the steps of supplying a high frequency alternating current to the lamp in series with an inductance means from an inverter, the lamp and inductance means forming a load sensing the current through the load and varying the supply frequency in accordance with the sensed current to maintain a substantially constant current through the load.In order to dim the light output of the lamp, the method of the invention further provides for decreasing the voltage of the supply to the inverter which in turn decreases the voltage applied to the load, the current through the load being maintained substantially constant by increasing the frequency of the supply in accordance with the increased impedance of the load. With this method the lamp light output decreases because the energy through the lamp voltage x current decreases, while the current through the lamp remains substantially constant.The constant current through the lamp has the benefits of ensuring a normal life expectancy for the lamp and facilitating control of harmonic feedback to an AC mains supply using a suitable filter. This applies even when the lamp is dimmed.According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a power supply for a gas discharge lamp comprising an inverter for driving the lamp at a frequency sufficiently high for it to operate in a linear resistance mode wherein the inverter is of a variable frequency type comprising two switch means for switching a drive output between voltages of opposite polarity and having a switching transformer controlling the switch means, and impedance means connectable in series with a lamp to form a load, the switching transformer being connectable to the load to provide positive current feedback to the inverter to control its frequency to maintain a substantially constant current through the load.The switching transformer is preferably in series with the load, however it may also be in parallel with the load.Preferably the frequency of the inverter is between 2 and l kHz, more preferably between 3 and 7 kHz, and most prefrably between 3 and 48 kHz, during normal operation, though the frequency will be in the higher ranges when the light output is dimmed.There may be a plurality of loads in parallel with each other, each load comprising a lamp in series with an inductance means.Preferably the inverter is of the push pull type. Preferably the switch means are FET s i.e. field effect transistors, though any suitable switching transistors may also be usedPreferable voltage limiting means is connected across the drain and source of each FET collector and emitter in the event of transistors . Preferably a current limiting means is provided to control the voltage applied to the gate base of each switch means by sensing the current passing through the switch. The voltage and current limiting means are to protect the FET s transistors in the event of input power supply surges, e.g. resulting from lightning strikes or if a tube is removed or fails while the inverter is operating or during start up.Preferably, such as for use with an AC supply, e.g. mains supply, a filter is provided on the input power supply to the inverter upstream of the rectifier. Preferably in addition to the filter a radio interference suppression capacitor, suitably of ,1 to 8,1 pF,is provided in parallel with the inverter. A capacitor to provide a striking or starting potential across the lamp is provided in parallel with the inverter, current limiting means being provided to control the supply of current to this capacitor so that a starting potential is achieved only after a predetermined time interval sufficient to allow the lamp elements to be heated. Preferably bypass means is provided to by pass the current limiting means for normal operation of a lamp. Preferably the bypass means is activated in response to striking of the lamp. According to another aspect of the invention a method of starting a gas discharge lamp includes the steps of restricting the current supply to the lamp during starting thereof and subsequently increasing the current supply to the lamp, including the further steps of sensing the current through the lamp and increasing the current supply only when the sensed lamp current increases on starting the lamp.This method ensures that the current applied to the inverter and lamp is limited during starting so as to prevent shocks to the lamp and inverter components during starting, which shocks are known to shorten the life of these components. In addition the terminals for the lamp, when a lamp is not present, are protected or made safe because a limited current only is present which would not be harmful if accidentally touched. Full current is present at the terminals only when a lamp is in place and starts or strikes.Preferably this method includes the further steps of connecting the elements of the lamp in series with each other and a capacitor, supplying an alternating voltage to the lamp from an inverter, increasing the frequency of the alternating voltage to allow an increasing current to flow through the elements to heat them and after a predetermined time delay applying a potential across the lamp to cause it to start.This method ensures beneficial slow heating of the lamp filaments and beneficial run up of the inverter to operating frequency Yet another aspect of the invention provides a ballast for a gas discharge lamp including current limiting means for limiting the current delivered to the discharge lamp during starting thereof, and means responsive to striking of the lamp for by passing the current limiting means to allow adequate current to the lamp during normal running thereof.Further aspects of the invention as well as optional and preferred features are set out in the appended claims, which are to be regarded as a part of the present disclosure, and will become evident from the following description made with reference to the accompanying drawings of preferred embodiments of the invention.In the drawings Figure 1 shows an embodiment of an electronic ballast or power supply of the invention for a low pressure gas discharge lamp, such as a fluorescent tube Figure 2 shows an input filter for the invention Figure 3 shows how up to four lamps are connected for operation from a single ballast andFigure 4 shows an alternate arrangement for coupling the lamp to an electronic ballast.Referring to Figure 1 of the drawings there is shown an electronic ballast circuit l for fluorescent tubes, i.e.low pressure gas discharge tubes, comprising an alternating current mains input 12, a conventional full wave bridge rectifying circuit 14, a slow start circuit 16, an oscillator circuit or inverter 18, a fluorescent tube 2 and a start circuit 22 for the oscillator 18 generally between the circuits 16 and 18.The slow start circuit 16 comprises a current limiting resistor Rl. 27 K, 1 2 W and a capacitor C1 47 pF, 38 45V , which with Rl provides a RC time constant of about 1 second. In parallel with the resistor R1 there is d by pass circuit 24 comprising a thyristor TH1 which bridges the resistor R1 and which has its gate connected in series with a transformer coil T1, a resistor Rl,l 1K , and a diodeD1. A resistor R1,2 lk bridges the base and emitter of thyristor TH2.The oscillator circuit 18 is of the push pull type comprising two transformer coupled switching circuits 26.The upper circuit 26 shown in the drawing comprises a field effect transistor FET F1, e.g. types 1RF 83 or BU 241A a resistor R2 lE , a transformer coil T2 and a zener diodeZD1. The lower circuit 26 shown in the drawing has the same components, but with the reference number 2. The oscillator 18 also includes, as normally required for switching, a capacitor C2 ,1 sF in the upper, positive line of the circuit in series with the lamp 2. Each of the FET s F1 and F2 is over current and over voltage protected as follows.First a zener diode pair in series 28 of 150V and 2V, 5W is connected, respectively, across each FET between source and drain. Each zener diode pair 28 acts as a voltage clamping device to limit the peak voltage applied to eachFET to prevent overloading such as when a tube is removed or against the effects of lightning. In practice, the FET may be designed to accommodate a peak voltage of 500 volts, while the zener diode pair is selected to conduct at 35 volts. In this way when the breakdown voltage of the zener diode is exceeded it becomes conducting and the current can flow through it thereby to protect the FET.Second each switching circuit 26 has a current control circuit 3 controlling the gate of the FET. Each control circuit 3 comprises a resistor 32 2 x2 E7 in the negative or earthline to the source of the FET. The high voltage side of the resistor is connected via a current limiting resistor 34 2K2 to the base of a transistor 36 type BC 184 , the collector of which is connected to the gate of the FET. The value of the resistor 32 is selected using Ohm s Law V IR, such that when the current through resistor 32 exceeds a predetermined value, say 5 mA, a trigger voltage of ,6V is present at point A. Thus transistor 36 is switched on, the voltage at the gate drops, consequently the current through the FET drops and the current through the resistor 32 falls.When the current through resistor 32 drops there is consequently a decreased potential across resistor 32 and transistor 36 switches off. In this way the current through each FET is controlled such that it is below the maximum current which the FET can handle when there is a peak voltage across the fluorescent tube. Hence an overcurrent through the FET which can damage the FET is prevented this situation might arise at switchon or if there is a short circuit.The tube 2 has conventional heating elements or filaments 21 which are in series with each other and a capacitor C3 33 nF, 200BV , The heating elements are also in series with a choke Ll, type EC3B,135T and a transformer coil T4 which is in series with the inverter output. The starter circuit 22 for the oscillator 18 comprises a resistor R4 33 K in series with a capacitor C4 BilpF which together form a time delay circuit of shorter duration than Rl,Cl. A diac DC1 BR 1B8 3, DO 14 is. connected between the time delay circuit R4.C4 and the gate 9f FET F2.A diode D2 is also connected from the time delay circuit R4,C4 to the transformer coil T4 and the FET Fl and F 2. The starter circuit also includes a resistor R5 which is a high value resistor, say 33 k.ohms, and provides a minimal starting current for FET, F1. A capacitor, not shown, may be provided to speed up starting of this FET by discharging and conducting starting current when FET F1 fires.The transformer coilsTl, T2, T3 and T4 are coup led to one another and are arranged in what is known in the art as a pot core transformer . In this embodiment the transformer is a 26mm Phillips FX 224. In practice the circuit described above operates as follows.At switch on, an alternating current is applied from the mains 12 to the bridge rectifier 1 4 from which is obtained an unsmoothed direct current. At this stage the thyristorTH1 is off and current flows slowly through resistor R1 to charge capacitor C1. At the same time current flows through resistor R4 and capacitor C4 as well as through R5 to FET F1. When the capacitor C4 reaches a predetermined potential, say 2 volts, the diac DC1 breaks down and an input pulse is applied to FET F2. The oscillator 18 thus initiates oscillation as will be more fully described later.The oscillating current in the oscillator 18 allows current to flow along the upper, positive line through the capacitorC2, through the filaments 21 and capacitor C3, and then through the choke L1 and coil T4. As current flows capacitor C2 charges until there is no further current flow.At this stage the coil T4 becomes saturated causing F2 to switch off and F1 to switch on. When this occurs capacitor C2 is shorted out and dumps its stored energy through the tube 2. When C2 has discharged, F1 switches off and F2 is switched on. The oscillator thus oscillates. The frequency of the oscillator is dependant on the period required to saturate the coil T4 and accordingly is dependent on the current flow through the filaments 21 and capacitor C3. As the capacitor C1 charges and the voltage across it increases the frequency of the oscillator 18 also increases.As this frequency increases the current flow through the capacitor C3 increases and the current flow through the filaments increases. This in turn causes a further increase in frequency of the oscillator 18 because T4 saturates more rapidly. This increased current heats the filaments 21 further until such stage as the capacitor Cl reaches the breakdown voltage of the tube, normally in the region of l to 188 volts. When the tube fires, i.e.a discharge arc forms between the filaments 21, the internal resistance of the lamp falls rapidly to a low negative resistance and there is a relatively large current flow through the choke L1 and coil T4. Since the coil T4 is coupled to the coil T1 of the by pass circuit 24, there is a current pulse to the gate of the thyristor TH1 when the current in T4 reaches a predetermined value, e.g. saturation.This pulse switches on the thyristor THl so that the current limiting resistor R1 is by passed. Sufficient current now passes through the tube 20 to sustain the discharge. During oscillation of the oscillator 18, energy transferred to the coil T1 is sufficient to energise the gate of TH1 and keep it on even though its supply is a DC varying from 0 to peak voltage.During normal operation the oscillator 18 oscillates at a relatively high frequency, optimally about 3 to 45 kHz, but the frequency of which is dependent on the current flow through or the impedance of the tube. This lamp current flow varies as the tube heats up to its operating temperature normally in the region of400C,Immediately after firing the operation of the oscillator 18 is as follows. As the current increases the frequency increases but at the same time the impedance of the choke L1 in series with tube 2 and forming the load also increases as a result of the frequency increase.This impedance increase with frequency in turn causes a decrease in current in the choke and therefore a reflexive decrease in frequency of the oscillator 18 since T4 takes longer to saturate.This change in frequency of the oscillator 18 normally continues for about 2 to 3 minutes until the operating temperature has been reached and the current flow through the tube stabilises. If the impedance or the tube 2 changes during normal operation the frequency will also change so that the current through the lamp 2 and choke L1, i.e.load, remains substantially constant. If the lamp is dimmed by reducing the input voltage at 12, the frequency increases to maintain the current through the lamp although the voltage across it is less.The frequency of about 3 to 45 kHz is selected because this is optimum for the FET s and because it ensures that when the frequency of the oscillator drops it does not drop below 15 to 2kHz which is the frequency below which the plasma in the tube no longer has a substantially linear resistance.The minimum resistance of, the tube will depend on the tube, the density of gas in the tube, the composition of the gas, the number of tubes being operated and other factors as is well known in the art.A feature of the ballast 18 is that the oscillation frequency is load dependent, the load being the lamp 2 in series with the choke L1, the frequency varying in such a manner that the current through the load is substantially constant, even when the lamp is dimmed.As mentioned previously, the time constant of R4, C4 is considerably less than that of Rl,Cl so that after the diac has broken down and the oscillator started the diac no longer functions. In other words as the FET F2 fires because of the voltage through the diac DCI, F2 is connected to ground and C4 to zero or a low voltage, such as ,6 volts. This voltage is too low to cause the diac DC1 to breakdown again. The frequency of the oscillator is much shorter than the time constant of R4, C4 so that C4 always remains at a low potential. The diode D2 allows C4 only to be pulled, i.e. discharged, to ground.The capacitor C forms a frequency break for the circuit, i.e. it serves to isolate the high frequency oscillator and tube from the rectifier 14 and mains supply 12. A further radio interference capacitor C5 0,01 F to 8,1 pF, e.g.Phillips MKT P is provided in parallel with CI to minimise or isolate radio noise.Figure 2 shows a noise filter 4 provided at the input 12 to the rectifier 14. The filter 4 comprises three inductances 42 each ,5H and two capacitors 44 1,5 pFr and 45 2 F arranged as shown.An optional feature is a pair of capacitors 46 in series between the input lines, with a central tap 48 that may be connected to ground for earthing high frequency oscillations. Also shown adjacent the filter is a metal oxide thyristor 5 for transient voltage protection, known in the art as an M.O.V e.g. V 275 LA lA . Figure 3 shows how a plurality of tubes 2, up to four if required, are connected to the ballast l of Figure 1. The tubes 2 are in parallel with one another and each tube 2g has its own capacitor C3 and choke L1. Figure 4 shows an example of a parallel connection for tube 20 or plurality of tubes 2 according to Figure 3 .Instead of being directly connected in series to the output of the ballast, the tubes are connected through a transformer 52 which operates in a non saturated mode.Effectively each tube 20 is still in series with the ballast output. This arrangement is suitable for use in those regions where the mains supply is of the order of the striking potential of the tube,e.g. 1lV, 6Hz, and the transformer 52 is used to step up the potential particularly for firing the tube.The component values given in the description above are illustrative values for a 22 to 25V, 5Hz supply and are not to be regarded as limiting. On test with two type A4 lamps of 40 watt this circuit has provided the following results Relative light output 115 and 95 Power factor Supply voltage 23V input current 0,461A input power 98,44W power factor ,93 Harmonics in AC supply frequencies in Hz even frequencies, i.e. 100, 2, 3, 4, 5 each less than 1 odd frequencies, 150 6 , 25 5,2 , 350 2,8 450 ,7 , 550 1,2 The embodiment described above has the following advantages.First it is a soft start circuit in that the filaments 21 heat up slowly and the potential applied to the electronic components is initially low and then increase relatively gradually. Nominally the starter time is of the order of 1 second.Second, the high frequency circuit is automatically balanced and is stabilised in accordance with a substantially constant current through the tube this substantially constant current greatly facilitates harmonic feedback to the main supply.Third the oscillator 18 automatically stops when the tube is removed and the soft start circuit is switched out. At this stage the circuit is protected by a 27 kilo ohm resistor whereby all lines are unsafe and may even be accidently touched by hand.Fourth, the electronic ballast is of relatively low weight, for example is approximately 18 of the weight of a conventional inductive ballast. The ballast also has a high power factor and thus a low heat dissipation.Fifth, the tube may be dimmed, at least to a level above l volts which is required for maintaining the arc across the tube, by decreasing the mains voltage. The light output of the tube may be decreased by approximately up to 5 , depending on the type of tube.Sixth, the tube does not flicker and does not exhibit stroboscopic effects.Seventh, the high frequency is shielded from the mains line, with suppressed radio interference and harmonic feedback to the mains supply.Finally, the same ballast can be used with any number of tubes 2, i.e. from one to four tubes, and can be used with tubes of different wattages. In other words the ballast is not limited to a particular size or number of tubes, since the oscillator frequency is load dependent and simply varies frequency in accordance with number and types of tubes being supplied. It is to be understood that the invention is not limited to precise details shown in the drawings and described above and many mod if ications may be made, as well as other embodiments will become apparent, without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. For example the starter circuit 16 may be used with other ballast circuits. Also, while not advised, starter circuits other than a tube striking dependant circuit 16 may be used with the inverter circuit 18 the frequency of which is load dependant.
