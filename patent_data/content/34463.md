# An electric toaster.

## Abstract
A toaster for toasting a slice of bread 1,2 comprises a casing 3 in which a reciprocable carriage 25 is located and is movable towards and away from an aperture 10 defined by the casing 3 through which aperture 10 a slice of bread 1,2 when mounted on the carriage 25 can pass. A pair of enclosed electric bar heating elements 23 is disposed within the casing 3 respectively adjacent opposed side edges of the casing 3 defining the aperture 10 . A motor arrangement is provided for the carriage 25 which can thereby be driven from a first position remote from the aperture 10 into a second position at a predetermined speed. In this way a slice of bread 1,2 mounted on the carriage 25 can be made to pass between the elements to toast both sides of the slice progressively as the slice passes out of the casing 3 through the aperture 10 . The degree of toasting is determined by the speed of movement of the carriage 25 .
