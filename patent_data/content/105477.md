# Printing press with cylinder skew and throw off.

## Abstract
A printing press 10 comprises a frame 40, 41 . A plate cylinder 12 is mounted in the frame for rotation about a first axis and a blanket cylinder 14 is mounted in the frame for rotation about a second axis. The plate cylinder 12 and the blanket cylinder 14 have a contact pressure therebetween for printing operation. A skew eccentric 38 is supported by the frame and is associated with at least one end of the plate cylinder. The skew eccentric is operable to change the relative angular positions of said first and second axes. A means is connected with said skew eccentric for maintaining the contact pressure between the plate cylinder and the blanket cylinder substantially unchanged upon rotation of the skew eccentric.
