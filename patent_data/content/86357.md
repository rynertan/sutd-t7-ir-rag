## Description
METHOD FOR PROVIDING A CRANKCASE FOR A RECIPROCA TING INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE AND CRANKCASE REALIZED BY SAID METHOD The present invention refers to a method for providing a crankcase for a reciprocating internal combustion engine and to the respective crankcase so obtained. As known, the present crankeases for internal combustion engines have a supporting body obtained from iron casting and provided with cylindric seats into which tubular barrels are fitted, and inside which barrels, in use, the pistons slide. The crankcases of the above mentioned type suffer from some disadvantages substantially de to the use of the barrels. In fact, frequently a small gap forms between each barrel and the corresponding cylindric seat which makes the thermal transfer worse and the cooling of the crankcase more difficult. Since the supporting action is carried out substantially by the crankcase, this latter presents, together with the barrels, a total mass fairly high which affects both the weight and the cost of the material needed.This mass is particularly high in the case of crankcases for diesel engines, in which between contiguous barrels it is necessary to form a gap into the crankcase in order to allow the flow of a liquid for the cooling of the crankcase itself. To the above mentioned drawbacks it is necessary to add the costs connected with the prerrangement of the cylindric seats in the crankease, with the preparation and machining of the barrels and with the labor required to fit the barrels into the corresponding seats. The object of the present invention is to provide a method which allows to obviate the a bove mentioned drawbacks in the production of crankcases for reciprocating internal combustion engines.This objet is obtained with the present in invention which relates to a method for the produc tion of a crankcase for a reciprocating internal combustion engine, characterized in that it provides a treatment during which a surface layer of each cylindric seat of the said crankcase ig subjected to a hardening so as to produce a transformation af state, from ferritic to substantially martensitic, of the material forming the said layer. The present invention further relates to a crankcase for a reciprocating internal combustion engine provided whith a cast iron body and having cylindric seats, characterized in that each of said seats has at least on layer the surface structure of which is substantially of the marten sitic type. For a better understanding of the present invention, it will be now described, as a non limiting example, a preferred embodiment, with refe pence to the accompanying drawing, in Which figures 1 and 2 are elevation and crosssection views of parts of two crankases embody ing the method of the present invention and figure 3 is a photomicrograph of a cross saction of a surface layer of a preselected area in anyone of the crankcases of figures 1 and 2 above mentioned. With particular refernece to figure 1, it is referenced ganerally in 7 a part of the cast iron crankcase of an internal combustion engine, as for instance a crankcase of a diesel engine.The crankcase t has a supporting body 2 in which cylindric seats 3 are machined, between which seats in the body 2 are provided gaps 4 in which flows, in use, a cooling liquid. According to the present invention, each cylindric seat 3 has, in an annular area 5 next to the top dead center, a har dened surface layer 6, the structure of which is substantially of the martensitic type, while the material forming the remainig part of the body 2 has a structure substantially of the ferritic type. Preferably, the surface layer 6 is obtained subjecting the iner surface of area 5 to a treatent with a power laser beam.In particular the laser bean is directed on the surface of the area 5 in such a way as to follow a circular path and with values of specific power in the range from 300 to 3000 W per square centimeter. With particular reference to figure 2, it is referenced generally with 11 a crankcase quite similar to the 1 previously de new generation more compact, light and cheap . In the crankcase 11 are represented with 12 the cast iron supporting body, with 13 the cylindric seats machined in the body 12, with 15 the area next to the top dead center and with 16 the hardened surface layer. Referring to figure 3, it is represented with 21 an area having a structure of the ferrite type and forming the base material of the body 2, with 22 a surface area having a structure of the martensitic type. and forming the surface layer 6 or 16, and with 23 a thermally modified area arranged between the above mentioned area 21 and 22. As said above, the method according to the present invention consists substantially in sending a laser beam having a suitable power on the inner surface of each cylindric seat 3, 13 of the crankcase 1, 11 at issue, to obtain the required change from ferritic to martensitic state. As a consequence it has been noted that it is no more necessary to have the barrel fitted into the corresponding cylindric seat, and hence are automatically overcome the drawbacks connected withy the use of the above mentioned barrel. In particular, the thermal transfer results highly increased, as the heat transfer takes place in a bett3r way due to the lack of any gap.In case it is not of interest the flow of the cooling liquid, as shown in figure 2, the dimensions of the crankease can be reduced, or in other words it is possible to shorten the engine without reducing the diameter of the cylinders. It has also been observed that the hardening of the area adjacent to the top. dead center causs an overall improvement of the wear resistance of the body 2 or 12 with a consequent increase of the life of the respective crankcase a Ereferably, before or after said treatment with laser, the inside of each cylindric seat is subjected to a winding operation. It t is there fore obvious that i the costs connected with the nea of labor are drastically reduced as compared with the corresponding costs for the production of the presant cranckases It is finally obvious that changes and modifications can be made to the above mentioned method and cranckases, without departing from the scope of the invention. 3Por example, the hardening of the layer 6, 16 could also be obtained with a hardaning operation without the use sem. Further, it is not limiting the of the hardened surface layer 6 or 16 for example the latter could be formed by a single annular band of predetermined height, by a multi start elliptic curve, by a plurality of parallel bands axial or oblique and equidistant, etc.
