# High power direct current switching circuit.

## Abstract
A DC power switching circuit is disclosed connecting a load to a DC power source J1 A3 while suppressing arcing across a relay in the network. A normally open relay K2 has its energizing coil X1 X2 connected to the control input 22 of the circuit, the opposite end X2 of the coil being connected to the gate of a silicon controlled rectifier SCR101 . The SCR has its principal current conducting path connected between the load and the DC power source J1 A3 , for conducting current between the load and the power source during a first delay interval, thereby reducing the potential difference between the contacts A1 A2 of the relay K2 so as to prevent its arcing during the closure of the contacts A1 A2 . An FET device Q103, Q104 has its principal current conducting path connected between the load and the DC power source J1 A3 and has its gate R30, C7, R31, U1D, CR7, R26, C8 connected to a timer. The timer has a control input connected to the control input 22 of the circuit so that it turns on the FET Q103, Q104 for a duration of a second delay interval in response to an off signal at the control input 22 for the circuit so that the relay contacts A1 A2 are shunted while they are opening from a closed state, thereby preventing arcing across the contacts. In this manner, the relay K2 is protected from arcing both on opening and closing of its contacts A1 A2 .
