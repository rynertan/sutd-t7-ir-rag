# Boosting circuits.

## Abstract
An output clock signal of a driver 11 charges load capaci tance CL to a specific voltage. Boosting circuit 21 has a boosting capacitance CB one end 13 of which is arranged for receiving a clock signal , delayed from the output clock signal of driver 11. A charging circuit for CB comprises voltage supply line 24 and transistor Q3, so CB does not load driver 11. A gate circuit comprising transistor Q1 is provided between boosting capacitor CB and the load capacitance CL. A gate control circuit opens transis tor Q1, so that charges can pass from CB to CL to boost the voltage of CL, when a clock signal is received. When CL is being discharged the gate control circuit closes transistor Q1. The gate control circuit includes an auxiliary capacitor CG, a transistor Q2 and voltage line 24. CG is charged from the driver 11 through Q2 and when clock signal is received the voltage of CG, which is applied to the gate of Q1, is raised to open Q1.
