# Method and system for reproducing identification characters.

## Abstract
A method and system are described for producing identification characters that are both man and machine readable. The identification characters, such as those on a patient s I.D. bracelet or an inventory control tag, are scanned with an optical character reader. The character information obtained from the reader, or other input source, is processed an used to control the reproduction of the identification characters using a dot matrix printer. The readability of the characters is enhanced by using thermal paper and increasing the heat applied by the dot matrix printer to 1 enlarge the area of the dots and 2 increase their optical absorbance. The increased area and absorb ance produces an apparent solid line character which is more easily readable by an optical character reader.
