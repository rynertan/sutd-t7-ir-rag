# Magnetic recording reproducing apparatus.

## Abstract
A magnetic recording reproducing apparatus in which at least two recording and reproducing magnetic heads 18, 19 25, 26, 27 28 36 37 38 39 are mounted on a rotatable cylinder 17 24 35 with an angular distance of 180 there between, wherein audio signals undergone a pulse code modulation are recorded on record tracks slanted relative to the longitudinal direction of a magnetic tape 1 wrapped around the rotatable cylinder. The record track is divided trackwise into a plurality of channels CH . The audio sig nals are recorded on the channel basis. The magnetic tape is transported in a forward or backward direction while re cording or reproduction is conducted. The rotatable cylin der has mounted thereon a first erasing head 20 29 40 59 72 rendered operative when the magnetic tape is trans ported in the forward direction and a second erasing head 21 30 41 60 73 operative when the magnetic tape is transported in the backward direction for erasing only the audio signal of a given channel on the record track.
