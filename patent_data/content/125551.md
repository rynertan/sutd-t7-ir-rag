# Articulated portable trolley, designed to facilitate changing the wheels of trucks, coaches, tractors and similar vehicles.

## Abstract
The invention in question concerns an articulated port able trolley designed to facilitate changing the wheels of trucks, coaches, tractors and similar vehicles. The trolley, which is inserted under the wheel to be changed after it has been raised from the ground, can be adjusted according to the size of the wheel and raised to bring two arms with rollers into contact with the tire, which is supported, in this way, during dismantling. After having unscrewed the bolts, the trolley enables the wheel to be changed to be removed and lowered to the ground without effort. The new wheel to be mounted is then placed on the two lowered arms of the trolley and is, in this way, easily raised to the height of the hub and brought close to it. One of the two rollers may be made to rotate to make the wheel turn slowly to align the holes on the rim with the corresponding connections on the hub. The trolley is adjustable so as to be adaptable to wheels of differing sizes and can be dismantled in such a way as to be contained in a small case.

## Description
Articulated portable trolley, designed to facilitate chan ging the wheels of trucks, coaches, tractors and sinilar vehicles.Changing a wheel of a truclr or large vehicle, in the case of a sudden puncture, is a particularly time consuming and laborious operation. Indeed, the tires, and in particular those without inner tubes, which have a special netallic rim vrith numerous bolts to guarantee the necessary bold, are of considerable eight and a notable effort is needed in order to pull out and replace them manually in the correct position. The difficulty increases considerably when it is necessary to change the inner wheel of a pair of dual wheels.The device in question makes the operation of changing a wheel particularly simple and rapid, and, being portable, can be easily used by the driver of the vehicle himself, in any situation. Because of its practicability, the device is also particularly useful to tire repairers and repair workshops in general. The device is constitued of an articulated portable trolley, which in the dismantled position can be placed in a small container and, when necessary, can be rapidly assem bled without the use of tools. The trolley is inserted under the wheel to be changed after it has been raised fron the ground by a normal jack and is adjusted according to the size of the wheel.Because of the articulatory move nent with which it is equipped, the two arms with rollers inserted vnder the wheel rise until they come into contact with it and support it during disniantling. Then the bolts are unscre. et and moving the trolley sideways on the wheels with which it is ea uip eds the wheel is removed and placed on the ground, making the jack which controls the articulatory novenent return to the lowered resting position.The new wheel to be noun ted is then placed on the two lowe red arus of the trolley, which is moved sideways towards the vehicle and the two arms with rollers are raised with the jack and, supporting the wheel, bring it up to the sane height as the hub. One of the two rollers on which the tire rests can be rotated manually to make the wheel turn and, in this way, align the holes of the rim with the con sections of the hub. At this point, the trolley is advanced further to insert the wheel which can, in this way, be blocked.The trolley is then lowered, removed, dismantled and repla ced in its container.The invention will now be described in detail with the aid of the attached drawings, which, by way of example only, represent one possible constructive solution.Fig. 1 shows the mounted articulated trolley in perspective.Fig. 2 shows the trolley in the operating position while supporting the wheel of a large vehicle.As is clear in fig. 1, the device is constituted of a fixed frame 1, p1 aced in a slightly inclined position to support the convex side of the tire. Integral to the frame I, is the lover crcss bar 2, to the extremities of which may be telescopically inserted the couplings 3 of the arns 4. The coulings 3 cGn slide freely inside the cross bar 2, so as to be able to vary the distance between the two arms 4, in relation to the size of the wheel to be changed, and can also be removed completely to dismantle the device.Applied to the inner part of the two arms 4 are, respectively, a roller 5, free to rotate on its ovm axis, and a rol ler 6, which can be rotated by moving alternatively the lever 7 which has at its base an automatically tripped insertion device to make the roller 6 rotate in a single direction.The tire, which rests on the rollers 5 and 6 applied to the two arms, can, in this way, be made to rotate by means of the lever 7 to obtein the alignment of the holes of the rim with the connections of the hub, during the mounting phase.To this end, the roller 6, which gives the rotarory move nent to the tire, has a roughened surface to avoid slipping.To the anterior extremities of the arms 4 are applied the wheels 8, supported by the forks 9 pivoted in 10 on the arms 4. The inner extremities of the forks 9 are pivotted in 11 at the anterior extremities of the levers 12, inserted insi de the arms 4. The other extremities of the levers 12 are pivoted in 13 to the levers 14, which can be rotated by means of the square bar 15, inserted in the bearings 16.In this way, by rotating the square bar 15 in both directions, the levers 12 are pushed forwards and backwards, consequen tly varying the inclination of the forks 9 and, therefore, the height from the ground of the arms 4, which with the rollers 5 and 6 support the tire.The rotation of the squa re bar 15 is obtained by means of the sleeve 16 with levers 17, at the extremities of which is inserted a bar 18 which suraorts the pivoting wheels 19 and the base of the hydraulic jack 20. The extremity of the piston rod of the jack is inserted into the connection 21 integral to the fixed frame 1. In this way, using the operating lever 22 of tne jack, the levers 17 are moved away from the frame 1, the square bar 15 is rotated and the arms 4 are raised0 To relower the arns 4, operate the jach control 23 which deter nines the re entry of the rod into the cylinder.The sa lare bar 15 can be completely removed to dismantle the device and even the extremity of the piston rod can be removed from the connection 21 so that the levers 17 and the jack itself may be folded down inside the frame 1, to obtain minizan encumbrance.The flsme 1 can be equipped with connections 24 for the rapide insertion of the adjustable arms 25, at the extremities of which are applied a number of forks 26 with small wheels 27 designed to ensure a better support of the tire, without impeding the rotation to align the holes. The forks 26 can be rotated on their own axes to facilitate the introduction into the restricted space between the tire and the mudguard of the vehicle and then can be blocked in the working position by means of the screw in knobs 28. The size of the device and its constructive elements may be of any dimension, even in relation to the type of vehi cle or car for which it is intended for use, without stepping outside the limits of the present invention.
