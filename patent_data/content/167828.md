# A man made skin composed of two layers Collagen and a poly alpha amino acid.

## Abstract
This invention concerns a double layered man made skin which is prepared by laminating a collagen sponge sheet and a poly α amino acid membrane that has a good affinity with tissue cells and an appropriate permeability for moisture. When the man made skin is applied on burns, cuts or wounds, the fibroblasts proliferate in the collagen sponge sheet forming a three dimensional structure, while the epidermal cells proliferate in the region between the poly α amino acid membrane and a collagen sponge sheet. The poly α amino acid membrane plays a role in protecting affected part and in providing an optimum condition for the proliferation of fibroblasts and epidermal cells, and then it falls off as the epidermis completely regenerates. On the other hand, the collagen sponge sheet assimilates in the living tissue after having played a general role of the dermis.
