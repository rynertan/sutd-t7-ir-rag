## Description
The invention relates to a method of determining a measure E of the surface potential of a medium charged by means of a corona charging device, in which charge emitted by the corona electrode or electrodes near the charged surface to collect a part of the emitted charge, and in which the measure E is derived from the value i A method and device of this kind are known from US patent 3 604 925. It has been found that the known method and device for deter mining a measure of the surface potential are relatively inaccurate. The object of the invention is to provide a method and device with which the measure E can be accurately determined. According to the invention this object is achieved in that in a method of the kind referred to in the preamble, a measure i The invention is also based on the realization that the inac curacy of measurement is caused primarily by variations in the charge current i An attractive variant of the method according to the invention is characterised in that the value i A variant of the method according to the invention, in which the position of the measuring wire is so selected that the measuring wire collects only charge moving towards the medium surface, is very attrac tive because of its high sensitivity. In another variant of the invention, in which the predetermined relation is equal to C k1.i In a device of the kind referred to in the preamble for per forming the above method, the object aimed at is achieved according to the invention in that the device comprises a second measuring cir cuit for determining the value i The invention will be explained in detail with reference to two embodiments and Figs. 1 to 5 in which In Fig. 1, a photoconductor 1 is moved by a drive roller 5 past a corona electrode 2 at a distance therefrom. The rear screen or the like 3 is indicated diagrammatically at a distance from the corona electrode 2. A measuring wire 4 is clamped over the width of the pho toconductor so as to be situated at the back of the corona spray cone. The way in which a photconductor current i By measuring the factor K i In Fig. 2 as an example the relationship between the photocon ductor current i Fig. 3 diagrammatically represents an application of the inven tion in which application the invention is used to control the sur face potential. A high voltage source 10 feeds the corona electrode 2. The current i The voltage in the voltage divider 15 corresponding to the i The time constant of the integration amplifier 12 is, for example, one second, so that deviations of, for example, 100 V can be corrected within 1 second, i.e. within the time for charging one image area. An ASV deviation, however, is measured as an average over the total photoconductor width so that an ASV variation as high as this over the width generally does not occur. The control system operates as follows Immediately after switching on, the high voltage supply is controlled for about 50 msec in a preset current mod. This means that the supply acts as a fixed current source, the current setting of which is so selected that the photoconductor charge accompanying it cannnot become exceptionally high. This obviates any damage to the photoconductor on switching on. This pre charging interval of 50 msec corresponds to the said transit time between the corona device and the measuring wire during that interval of time after switching on there is in fact no signal in the measuring wire. Control in this preset current mode is obtained by setting the gain of the integra tion amplifier 12 to a minimum, the output voltage being set to the preset value. After that interval, this feedback loop for the ASV control is closed by increasing the integration amplifier gain, e.g. to 180x. Fig. 4 diagrammatically represents a control system using the invention. The control system is basically the same as that of Fig. 3 except that the buffer amplifier 21 is included and a circuit S₁ and a capacitor C₁ to earth are included in the output circuit of the integration amplifier 12, while a switch S₂ is included in the feed back loop of the integration amplifier 12. The operaton of this control system will be explained by reference to Fig. 5. During image charging in the interval t The substantially open condition of the two switches S₁ and S₂ is necessary in order to avoid any leakage of the capacitor charges in a standby situation. In this example, each capacitor will hold its voltage approximately 8 hours or more. This also prevents the integration amplifier 12 from coming up against the feed voltage. In order to avoid any influencing of the correction signal by short term charging disturbances, the time constant must be made large, i.e. 5 sec. As a result, after the high voltage source has been switched on or after a possibly long standby situation, a pre charging interval of several seconds has to be applied before a first charging can be made. It is clear that in this second embodiment no correction takes place during charging by the control system. Control of the high voltage supply is determined by the correction signal detected during the previous charging. The correction thus lags one charging behind. Also, no pre charging path is required in a series of consecutive chargings. Against this, a pre charging interval of about 5 seconds must be applied for a first charging or after a possibly long standby situation. The operation of the ocntrol system according to the first embo diment depends on the properties of the photocondutor. In the case of a uniform charging, e.g. 20V, in which the photoconductor unifor mity variations are of low frequency, i.e. there are no abrupt charge variations, the control system selected will operate without problems. The advantage is also that small charging differences within one image area can be corrected directly. When the charging differences are considerable, for example 50 V, and of high frequency, e.g. several abrupt variations per image area, the influence on the control system is measurable and such influence may be undersirable. This problem is obviated in the second embodiment, but a correct tion of the charging differences in one image area is then impossible. As described hereinbefore, the invention is suitable primarily for use in control systems for controlling the surface potential of a photoconductor fed past a corona device for charging purposes. However, the invention is equally applicable to those cases in which measurement of the ASV is desirable for other purposes. In the above described embodiments of the invention, the measure i The measure i
