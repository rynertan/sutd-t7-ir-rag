# Vector processor.

## Abstract
A vector processor for sequentially reading out elements of a plurality of vector operands OP1, OP2, OP3 and sequentially storing the results of operations to the vector operands, comprising operand counters 51a, 51b, 51c for indicating the element numbers for every operand address registers 21a, 21b, 21c for every operand a first comparator 108 for comparing each element of the vector maximum number registers 52a, 52b, 52c for storing the maximum numbers of elements of the respective operands a second comparator 53 for comparing the operand counter of each operand with the content of the maximum number registers 52a to 52c of each operand with respect to each operand and a control circuit 107 for independently updating the operand counters 51a to 51c and operand address registers 21a to 21c of each operand in response to all of or parts of the outputs of the first and second comparators 108 and 53
