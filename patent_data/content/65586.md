# Process for preserving the flavour of coffee beans.

## Abstract
Roasted coffee beans protected against premature loss of flavour by the uniform spraying of a solution or emulsion of a phosphatide on the surface of the roasted beans in a small well defined amount.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. Process to protect baked coffee beans against premature loss of flavour wherein a solution or emulsion of a phosphatide is sprayed upon the baked coffee beans in such an amount that after drying of the sprayed beans they are uniformly covered with 0.5 to 1.5 56 by weight of phosphatide, calculated to the weight of the baked coffee beans before being sprayed. 2. Process according to claim 1 characterized in that a phosphatide fraction free of oil at least 70 56 of which is phosphatidylcholine is used as phosphatide.

## Description
It is known that baked coffee beans emanate a strong flavour. It is generally desired that this flavour is preversed as much as possible until the beans are ground are andithe coffee drink is prepared. It is therefor preferred to store and transport baked coffee beans in airtight containers. The loss of flavour nevertheless is a problem with baked coffee beans during the transport from the baker to the user because the used containers quite often not sufficiently tight or a completely air tight closure needs too much work and is too expensive. The coating of the beans with usual coatings impermeable to flavours is not possible since such coatings are not unobjectionable in the following use of the coffee beans by grinding and extraction with hot water.It now has surprisingly been found that a premature ioss of coffee flavour may effectively be avoided by coating the baked coffee beans with a phosphatide in a low amount based upon the weight of the baked coffee beans. With this coating the known coffee flavour disappears almost completely and remains suppressed for a prolonged period of time while there is no disadvantageous influence to the taste and other desired properties of the coffee drink prepared from coffee beans so treated.Thus, the present invention is directed to a process to protect coffee beans against premature loss of flavour wherein a solution or emulsion of a phosphatide is uniformly sprayed upon the surface of the baked coffee beans in such an amount that after drying of the sprayed they beans are coated with the phosphatide in an amount of 0.5 to 1.5 by weight based upon the weight of the baked coffee beans for spraying.There may be used as phosphatide both naturally occuring and synthetic phospholipides. Useful naturally occuring phospholipides of vegetable or animal origin are in particular phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinosite, phosphatidylserine, kephaline, lysolecithine, phosphatidylglycerol, for instance from soybeans or eggs, as well as mixtures of several such phospholipides.Synthetic phosphatides are for instance ditetradecanoylphosphatidylcholine, dihexadecanoylphosphatidylcholine, dioleylphosphatidylcholine or dilinoylphosphatidylcholine and in particular di palmitoylphosphatidylcholine. Most preferably used is a phosphatide fraction which is free of oil and which contains at least 70 of phosphatidylcholine, for instance the phosphatidylcholine tradeproducts such asPhospholipon R 100 95 and natural phosphatidylcholine from soybeans , Phospholipon R 100 H 98 fully hydrogenated phosphatidylcholine from soybeans orPhospholipon R 80 phospholipides from soybeans containing 75 of phosphatidylcholine and 12 56 of phosphatidylethanolamine .The present process is preferably carried out in that the purified phosphatide fraction free of oil is converted to an aqueous emulsion containing 5 to 10 56 by weight of the phosphatide. This emulsion is sprayed after baking of the coffee beans upon the hot beans having a temperature of above 200 C. in an amount of 5 to 15 g., preferably 10 to 12.5 g. of phosphatide per 1 kilogramm of baked coffee beans. The water of the phosphatide emulsion evaporates momentarily and the phosphatide covers the baked coffee beans as a uniform coating. After cooling, a coffee bean product is obtained which emanates only a low flavour. Only after several hours there may be observed coffee flavour to a somewhat increased but still very weak degree.The resulting coffee beans may be ground and converted to coffee drink in usual manners directly without any further treatment.EXAMPLE 1 3 kg. of raw coffee beans are heated to a temperature of 22O0C. in manners known per se in a usual baking oven.After reaching this temperature there is sprayed upon the beans a 6.23 56 aqueous emulsion of a phosphatide fraction which is free of oil and contains at least 70 56 of phosphatidylcholine in the dry product trade productPhospholipon R 100 . The emulsion is sprayed to the beans in such an amount that after evaporation of the water the baked coffee beans are covered with a uniform phosphatide layer in an amount corresponding to 12 g. of the phosphatide per kilogramm of untreated baked coffee beans. EXAMPLE 2An emulsion of lecithine which is a trade product and may be dispersed in water is sprayed upon baked coffee beans as described in example 1 in such an amount and with such a concentration that after evaporation of the water the baked coffee beans are covered with 10 g.of the phosphatide per kilogramm of baked coffee beans before spraying.
