# METHOD FOR DETECTING END POINT OF ETCHING METHOD FOR DETECTING END POINT OF ETCHING

## Abstract
In making contact opening on insulation film which is provided on layer containing aluminium by selective dry etching method using reactive gas, the reactive gas con taining chlorine compound gas such as CClâ‚„ is used and then, when the contact opening reaches the layer contain ing aluminium, the intensity of emission spectrum of alumi nium increases rapidly, accordingly it becomes possible to detect end point of the dry etching on the insulation film by detecting the intention of the emission spectrum of alu minium.
