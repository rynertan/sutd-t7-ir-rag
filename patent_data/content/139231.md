# Piezoelectric transducer for yarn feelers, for use on spinning and weaving machines.

## Abstract
A piezoelectric transducer for yarn feelers for fitting to spinning and weaving machines and devices, constituted by a single ceramic member incorporating the yarn guide and cemented directly to a ceramic piezoelectric element, the size and shape of said member being chosen such that its resonance frequencies are very different from those of the textile machines and devices to which the yarn feeler is to be fitted.
