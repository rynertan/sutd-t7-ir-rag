# Conversion of incompatible mixed polyols to polyol products with increased resistance to phase separation.

## Abstract
The present invention is directed to a polyol mixture comprising the reaction product of at least two polyols which normally are incompatible with each other and an organic isocyanate, the isocyanate to hydroxyl equivalent ratio being from 1 4 to 1 35.
