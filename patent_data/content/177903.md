# Semiconductor device having a gallium arsenide crystal layer grown on a silicon substrate and method for producing it.

## Abstract
A GaAs semiconductor device comprises a Si substrate 1 , an intermediate layer 3, 4 formed on the substrate and a GaAs layer 2 grown on the intermediate layer. The intermedi te layer includes constituent GaP GaAsP and GaAsP GaAs superlattice layers and additionally AlP and AlGaP thin films.
