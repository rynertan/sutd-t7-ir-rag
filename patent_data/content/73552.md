# The production of methanol via catalytic coal gasification.

## Abstract
Methanol is produced by gasifying a carbonacesous feed material with steam in the presence of a carbon alkali metal catalyst and added hydrogen and carbon monoxide to produce a raw product gas comprising methane, steam, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen and hydrogen sulfide withdrawing the raw product gas from the gasifier and treating it to produce a treated gas containing primarily carbon monoxide, hydrogen and methane separating the treated gas into a methane rich gas stream and a gas stream containing primarily carbon monoxide and hydrogen pass ing the methane rich gas stream to a steam reforming furnace wherein a portion of the methane is reacted with steam to produce hydrogen and carbon monoxide which is then passed into the gasifier reacting the gas stream con taining primarily carbon monoxide and hydrogen in a methanol synthesis reactor in the presence of a methanol synthesis catalyst to form methanol which is recovered as a product from the effluent thereby leaving a gas comprising rcarbon monoxide, hydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide, at least a portion of which is recycled to the separation step of the process.
