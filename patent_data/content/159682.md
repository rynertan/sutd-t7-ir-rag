# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ACCELERATING THE RECORDING RATE OF A CRT GRAPHIC RECORDER

## Abstract
Provided are an apparatus and a method for recording on a recording medium images from a fiberoptic CRT. The apparatus includes a recording medium transport system, control electronics and a first in, first out memory. The use of the first in, first out memory permits incremental record ing which is not limited by relatively long mechanical trans port settling times. In operation, N lines of data are input to the memory, line by line, as the transport system incre ments the position of the recording medium and during settling time. When the recording medium has come to rest, these N lines of data are output sequentially from the mem ory in a first in, first out basis, with the CRT incrementing each line vertically on the recording medium for the total of N lines for each increment of the recording medium by the transport system.
