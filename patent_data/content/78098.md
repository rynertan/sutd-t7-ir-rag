# Cerium compounds.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to compounds and more particularly to cerium compounds and cerium compounds in association with other elements. The invention provides a process for the preparation of a dispersible product containing a cerium compound which comprises heating a cerium IV oxide hydrate in the presence of a salt to cause deaggregation of aggregated crystallites in the cerium IV oxide hydrate and produce a dispersible product containing a cerium compound. The salt may be chosen such that a selected chemical element is present in the dispersible product.
