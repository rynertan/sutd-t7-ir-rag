## Description
Preparation of an Antibiotic SelectivelyEffective Against staphylococcus Infections TECHNICAL FIELD This invention is directed to a strain of bacteria which, upon fermentation, produces an antibiotic selectively effective against staphylococcus, to an aerobic fermentation process utilizing such strain, and to fermentation products containing the antibiotic. BACKGROUND ART It has long been sought to develop narrowspectrum antibiotics effective against particular pathogenic microorganisms but not against normal bacterial flora which apparently constitute one of the body s natural protective mechanisms against disease. Organisms which may be quite resistant to many known antibiotics and for which selective bactericides are needed include the staphylococci, e.g. Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. These gram positive organisms have both been associated with wound and prosthesis infections, and S. aureus has also been implicated in a wide variety of systemic and localized diseases.While a number of broad spectrum antibiotics such as clindamycin, gentamicin, rifampin and methicillin are effective against these bacteria, no narrow spectrum antibiotics having selective antimicrobial activity against such staphylococcus infections have previously been developed. It is, accordingly, among the objects of the present invention to provide a process for the preparation of a narrow spectrum antibiotic having selective antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus infections associated with S. aureus and epidermidis, and compositions containing that antibiotic. A further object of the invention is to provide such an antibiotic which is effective upon topical application, which leaves normal flora intact, and which because of its limited absorption obviates risk of systemic toxicity, particularly in the critically ill patient. Other objects and advantages of the process and compositions of the invention will be apparent from consideration of the following detailed description of preferred embodiments thereof, considered in connection with the accompanying drawing. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING The drawing is a graph illustrating the effect of the novel antibiotic of the invention on the viability and turbidity of an S. epidermidis culture. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION According to the present invention a new strain of the microorganism Rothia dentocariosa has been found. The new strain, hereinafter referred to as the Howland strain of R. dentocariosa, was recovered from a culture of the normal aerobic bacterial flora of a human pharynx. Upon aerobic fermentation the new strain produces a novel antibiotic substance, referred to herein as staphylocidin , which has a narrow antibiotic spectrum and exhibits selective antimicrobial activity against staphylococci including S. aureus and S. epidermidis. A pure culture of the Howl and strain has been deposited at the American Type Culture Collection,Rockville, Maryland, under its accession numberATCC 31918. A sub culture of this living organism can be obtained upon request from the permanent collection of the ATCC. It has been found that the Howland strain ATCC 31918 produces staphylocidin upon fermentation in an aqueous nutrient medium containing assimilable sources of carbon, nitrogen and inorganic substances under submerged aerobic conditions. A staphylocidin containing product comprising the cell walls or murein produced during the fermentation is there after separated and recovered by a fractionation procedure known per se Park, J.T., and Hancoct A., A Fractionation Procedure for Stuides of theSynthesis of Cell wall Mucopeptide and of otherPolymers in Cells of Staphylococcus aureus ,J. Gen. Micro. 22 249 258 E96 . As previousely recognized in the literature, cell murein in a peptidoglycan heteropolymer comprising glycan strands cross linked through short peptldes Schleifer, K.H. and Kandler, O, Poptldoglyczn Types of Bacterial Cell Walls and their Taxonomic Implications , Bact, Rev. 36 4 , pp 407 477 E1972 . Fermentation of the Howl and strain to produce an antibiotic selectively effective against S. aureus and S. epidermidis was referred to in a paper by two of the present inventors, entitled Antistaphylococcal Substance s from a Pharyngeal Organism , presented at a syposium of The American Pediatric Society and theSociety for Pediatric Research on April 29 May 2, 1970. The Howland strain was not identified in the paper and was not then deposited in any public culture collection, nor was the separation, recovery or characterizarion of the styphylocidincontaining cell murein fermentation product disclosed therein. R. dentocariosa has previously been identified, based upon the protype strain deposited with the American Type Culture Collection, indexed as ATCC 17931. Based upon the typical peptidoglycan structure of cell mureins described bySchleifer, et al., supra, it is believed that murein prepared from the ATCC 17931 strain ofR. dentocariosa ATCC murein herein has a polymeric structure. incorporating the repeating units illustrated in Formula 1 below Formula IN acetylglucosamine unit N acetylmuramic unit EMI5.1 As shown, the putative polymeric structure of ATCC murein thus incorporates a carbohydrate backbone comprising N acetylglucosamine and N acetylmuramic acid repeating units, a peptide unit, and an intrapeptide bridge connecting the peptide unit to another peptide unit. The carbohydrate backbone in most bacteria similarly comprises alternating B 1,4 linked N acetylglucosamine and N acetylmuramic acid units as illustrated in Formula I. To date, only six variations have been described in the literature, and each such variation has occurred in the N acetylrnuramic acid residue Ghuysen, J.M.Shockman, G.D. Biosynthesis of Peptiodoglycan , in Bacterial Membranes and Walls , edited byLeive,, L. New York Marcel Dekker, Inc., p. 37 C1973 . The structure of the cell murein produced by fermentation of the novel Howl and strain of the present invention herein the Howland murein is, however, believed to differ from the ATCC murein both with respect to substitution of theN acetylmuramic acid units in the carbohydrate backbone and in regard to the composition of the intrapeptide bridge units thereon. This hypothesis is predicated on the amino acid aS amino sugar analyses of both the ATCC and Howl and mureins described more fully below. Such analyses indicate that the ratio of muramic acid to glucosamine content of the Howl and murein is about one third less than the ratio of such moieties in the ATCC murein, and that theHowl and murein contains approximately one half the alanine content of the ATCC murein.The former fact suggests a difference in the structure of the carbohydrate backbones of the respective peptidoglycans, perhaps the further substitution of the N acetylmuramic acid units of the Howland murein by a sugar having no amino groups thereon.The latter fact suggests structural differences in the intrapeptide bridge units of the respective macromolecules. From the preceding it may be seen that the precise chemical structure of the Howland murein is not presently known. It may, however, otherwise be characterized, as indicated more fully below, as comprising a peptido glycan polymer recovered from the fermentation product of theHowland strain, having a molecular weight at least equal to about 20 million Daltons, having the approximate amino acid and amino sugar content specified hereinafter, and incorporating the antibiotic material staphylocidin which is selectively effective against staphylococci including S. aureus and S. epidermidis. Staphylocidin has not, prior to the present date, been structurally characterized. It is, however, believed that staphylocidin is an intrinsic part of the Howl and murein macromolecule Evidence that staphylocidin is an integral part of the Howl and murein polymeric structure is provided by reacting the Howland murein with various murolytic enzymes. Thus, on the one hand, when Howland murein is treated with any of the enzymes amylase, ribonuclease A, phospholipaseA, chymotrypsin, pronase, or trypsin there is no change in its antimicrobial activity.On the other hand, when treated with enzymes capable of digesting murein, e.g. lysozyme which has N acetylmuramidase activity , lysostaphin which contains N acetylglucosaminidase and N acetyl muremyl alanine amidase , or basidiomycetes lysing enzyme which contains N acetylmuramylalanine amidase the antimicrobial activity of the Howland murein is destroyed. The latter enzymes hydrolyze bonds between the sugar molecules of the carbohydrate backbone of Howl and murein or the bond between the carbohydrate backbone and the peptide unit thereof. Based on these results it appears that the intact carbohydrate chain ofHowland murein either comprises or is sterically essential to the activity of staphylocidin, and that the antibiotic is thus an integral part of theHowland murein macromolecule. Moreover, bonding of staphylocidin to theHowland murein is suggested by gel filtration experiments in which Howl and fermentation broths were passed through a Sephadex G75 a bead formed, cross linked dextran absorbent gel commercially available from Pharmacia Inc. column, and the active fraction was recovered from the column void volume, even after eluting with a high salt concentration solution 0.5 M KCl , with 8M urea, or after boiling the broth samples in 1 sodium dodecyl sulfate and eluting the same with 0.1 sodium dodecyl sulfate. Since the gel column which has a resolving range of 3,000 80,000 M.W. for globular proteins did not separate the staphylocidin containing fraction, it is postulated that the staphylocidin is covalently bound to the murein macromolecule. BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION As indicated.hereinabove, the antibiotic staphylocidin is produced by fermentation of a new strain the Howland strain of R. dentocariosaThe staphylocidin containing fermentation product is obtained by isolation of the Howland murein and active fragments thereof which may be present, inter alia, in the fermentation broth . The staphylocidin itself has not been separated from the Howland murein, but is believed to be covalently bonded to and part of the macromolecular structure thereof. Preferred embodiments of the novel microorganism and the process for cultivating the same to produce staphylocidin containing products, data characterizing those products and documenting the selective antimicrobial activity thereof, and a description of the manner of use of products containing the antibiotic, are set out in detail below. rn..he Staphylocidin Producing Bacterium The Howland strain ATCC 31918 has been identified as R. dentocariosa by the AmericanType Culture Collection, both on the basis of its morphology and its biochemical reactions. Thus, strains of R. dentocariosa are reported to be positive for catalase production, nitrate reduction, aesculin hydrolysis and acid production from glucose, maltose, mannose, melezitose, salicin, sucrose and trehalose Bergey s Manual of Determinative Bacteriology, 8th Edition . After inoculation in brain heart infusion D fco BHI broth and growth for 48 hours at 370 C, the Howland strain is positive for each of these reactions. Similarly, the results from whole cell hydrolysis and analysis of carbohydrate fermentation end products are also consistent with . dentocariosa. The Howl and strain may further be dharacterised as follows a Morphology of colonies grown on BHI agar prL 72 hours at 370C colonies are smooth, creamy, off white with an entire border, while the individual cells within each colony are gram positive and cocco bacillary in shape, do not incorporate any filamentous forms, and are not acid fast b Biochemical Reactions after growth for 48 hours at 370C as aforesaid test results being determined 7 days after initiation of reaction Positive . or Negative ReactionHemolysis of sheep bloodIndoleVoges ProskauerGelatinase Nitrate reduction Catalase UreaseLecithinaseLipaseH2S productionHippurate hydrolysisAesculin hydrolysis Starch Hydrolysis c Acid forming Reaktions with Positive or Negative Reaction Adonitol AmygdalinL ArabinosaCellobioseDulcitolErythritolD Fructose D GalactoseD Glucose GlycerolGlycogen i Inositol Inul in LactoseMaltose D Mannitol D Mannose D Melezitose Melibiose Raffinose L Rhemnose D Ribose Salicin D Sorbitol L Sorbibose SucroseTrehaloseD Xylose d Whole cell hydrolysate galactose as the sole carbohydrate, no diaminopimelic acid and no arabinose and e Carbohydrate fermentation endProducts lactic acid and succinic acid, but not propionic acid.It will be understood that the morphology and biochemical reactions of the Howland strain may vary, depending upon the extent of growth of the culture upon examination or reaction. Thus, for example, cultures subjected to different growth conditions may include cells having filamentous as well as cocco bacillary forms. Process for the Preparation of the Staphylocidin Containing Products In accordance with this invention, theHowland strain, or a mutant thereof, is cultivated in an aqueous nutrient medium containing assimilable sources of carbohydrate, nitrogen and inorganic salts, under submerged aerobic conditions, until substantial antibacterial activity due to staphylocidin is produced. The conditions of the fermentation for the biological conversion to staphylocidin are generally the same as utilized in presently known methods for producing various antibiotics by aerated submerged fermentation. The fermentation medium contains the usual nutrients and mineral substances. Suitable nutrients include any assimilable sources of carbon such as the polysaccharides or starchs, or polyalcohols such as glycerol. An assimilable source of nitrogen may be supplied through the use of proteins, protein hydrolysates, urea, corn steep liquor, peptone, distillers solubles, fish meal and other conventional substances. The common anions and cations are supplied in the form of their non toxic salts.Trace elements such as manganese, cobalt, zinc, copper, etc. are obtained either as impurities in the above compounds, through the use of tap water, or by specifically adding solutions especially enriched with these trace elements. The other general conditions of the fermentation such as hydrogen ion concentration, temperature, time, rate of aeration, preparation of the inoculum, sterilization, inoculation and the like are conventional and are also similar to those utilized in the production of other antibiotics. The fermentation is allowed to proceed ixer normal conditions for from about 24 to 72 hours , which is the period normally required to obtain good growth of the culture of theHowl and strain. The antibiotic activity is thereafter recovered from the whole organism by procedures designed to purify murein, e.g., by the method of Park, et al., supra involving harvesting of the whole cells, heating with trichloroacetic acid, buffering and thereafter treating with trypsin. The Howland murein may be otherwise recovered by techniques known in the art, e.g. by treatment with trypsin, polyoxyethylene ethers e.g., Triton X 100 , and sodium dodecyl sulfate. Particularly preferred examples of the process for fermentation of the Howland strain and recovery of the staphylocidin containingHowl and murein are described below Example 1 Preparation of Staphylocidin b Fermentation in BHI Medium The Howland strain. was grown in a forcedair incubator in brain heart infusion broth DiSco BHI at 350C , with aeration by gentle shaking. After 65 hours of cultivation, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000G for 30 minutes, and then washed three times with distilled water. The cells were then suspended in 10 trichloroacetic acid and heated to 959C for 20 minutes. The suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 G for 20 minutes and the resulting pellet was washed five times with 0.1M phosphate buffer having a pH of 7.0. The pellet was then re suspended in phosphate buffer additionally containing 100 micrograms ml trypsin, and the suspension incubated for two hours at 370 C. The Howland murein thus recovered was thereafter washed four more times with distilled water. The resulting material was a white powdery material which, as indicated below, exhibited excellent antimicrobial activity against both S. aureus and S. epidermidis. Example 2 Preparation of Staphylocidin by Fermentation in Yeast Extract Sucrose Medium The Howl and strain was incubated as inExample 1 with the exception that the cultivation was in a medium containing 4 of a commercial grade yeast extract available from Yeast ProductsCo. as Ardamine Z and 2 sucrose available from Corn Products Co. as Cerelose as the carbon source at pH 6.8. Recovery of the murein was as in Example 1. Characterization of the Staphylocidin containing Product The Howland murein recovered as described hereinabove and having staphylocidin activity appears, as indicated hereinabove, to comprise a peptiodoglycan macromolecule. The chemical structure of the Howland murein differs, however, from that of the ATCC murein, as evidenced in part by variations in the amino acid and amino sugar contents of the respective mureins Amino acid and amino sugar contents were determined by analysis in a microbore system employing an o phthaldialdehyde fluoroescence high sensitivity detection system D D.urrum interfaced with a Perkin Elmer data processor, integrator and microprocessor. The quantitative values of the amino acids and amino sugars were obtained by comparing the chromatograms of the two mureins with the chromatograms of authentic standards.The amino acid contents were determined after hydrolysis in 6N HCl at 110 C in vacuo for 24 hours. The amino sugar analyses were conducted after mild acid hydrolyses 2N HCl at 100 C for 2 hours . The following comparative analyses were obtained TABLE ICOMPARATIVE AMINO ACID AND AMINO SUGAR CONTENTSOF H LtD AND ATCC MUREIN SAMPLES Amino Acid Howl and ATCC Murein .

The Howl and murein staphylocidin containing product was further characterized and distinguished from the ATCC murein by thin layer chromatographic analysis. The analysis was carried out as follows 200 mg of either Howland or ATCC murein was incubated with 10 mg lysozyme, 10 mg lysostaphin, 0.02 sodium azide and 0.01 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, for 48 hours in an 370C water bath.The murein digests were centrifuged at 10,000G for 20 minutes and filtered with 0.45 micron filters. The filtrates were lyophilized and re suspended in 0.5 ml distilled water. Sephadex G 10 gel a bead formed, crosslinked dextran absorbent gel commercially available from Pharmacia Inc. was autoclaved and packed in a column in accordance with the manufacturer s directions. The column was run with sterile distilled water and forty 1 ml fractions were obtained. An assay for carbohydrate using the phenol sulfuric acid method confirmed the presence of carbohydrates in the fractions. The fractions were thereafter lyophilized and dissolved in 50 ml of distilled water. The several fractions, n acetylmuramic acid and n acetylglucosamine, were spotted on inactivated silica gel G plates and run in one dimension using isopropanol acetic acid water 75 10 15 v v v. After drying, the plates were sprayed with 5 ammoniacal silver nitrate and heated at 100C for 10 minutes or until spots were obvious.

Antimicrobial Activity of the Staphylocidin Containing Products The antimicrobial spectrum of the Howl and murein sample prepared as described in Example 1 above was determined, and compared with the spectrum of ATCC murein similarly produced. In the tests summarized in Table III below, each test organism was inoculated in 1 ml of brain heart infusion, either with or without the addition of 5 sheep blood depending upon the particular organism , and incubated overnight at 370C. The antimicrobial concentrations of the Howl and murein were determined as the number of micrograms ofHowland murein per ml of Mueller Hinton agar containing 5 sheep blood at which less than five colonies of the particular test organism grew.As indicated below, the same concentrations of theATCC murein had no antimicrobial effect.

Additional evidence of the selective antimicrobial effect of the staphylocidin containing product against S. aureus was obtained by tests against cell wall deficient cultures L forms of S. aureus. The L forms were induced in brain heart infusion agar containing 5 NaCl in 0.05 M Tris HCl at pH 7.0 20 horse serum, and 900 micrograms ml of methicillin. Samples of the Howland broth after 65 hours of cultivation and the Howl and and ATCC mureins prepared as described in Example 1 above 40 mg ml were similarly diluted 1 10 in 5 NaCl in 0.05 M Tris HCl, pH 7.0. The cell wall deficient S. aureus test strain was streaked on agar plates.20 microliters of the various test solutions the pure buffer, and the Howl and broth, Howland murein and ATCC murein prepared as described above were then spotted on the agar plates. After 48 hours of incubation at 370C, the clear area in the locality of each drop was rated semi qutAi tatively from 1 low activity to4t high activity .As may be seen from Table IV below, both the Howl and broth and the Howland murein exhibited 4 activity, whereas both the buffer and ATCC murein samples exhibited no activity TABLE IVTHE ANTIMICROBIAL EFFECT OF HOWLAND AND ATCCSTRAIN MUREINS ON CELL WALL DEFICIENT FORMS OFSTAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS Sample Activity buffer None Howl and broth 4 Howl and murein 4 ATCC murein None The antimicrobial effect of the statiiLyocidin containing products of the invention against cultures of S. epidermidis has also been demonstrated. As indicated below, staphylocidin is both bactericidal and bacteriolytic forS. epidermidis. In a first test an overnight culture of S.epidermidis was inoculated into BHI broth.A Howl and broth, produced after 65 hours of fermentation as described in Example 1 above, and having an antimicrobial titer of 4 at 1 100 dilution and 1 at 1 400 dilution, was thereafter added to a first broth sample of the S. epidermidis culture after 4 hours growth thereof. A final dilution of S. epidermidis Howland broth of about 1 10 was thus obtained in the first broth sample. The viable cell concentrations in the S.epidermidis broth sample curve 2 in the accompanying drawing and in the S. epidermidis Howland broth sample curve 20 in the drawing were determined and plotted. Similarly, light absorbance at 620 nm was determined for both the S. epidermidis broth sample curve 4 in the accompanying drawing and the S. epidermidis Howland broth sample curve 40 in the drawing .The absorbance values illustrated in cruve 40 were corrected for the optical effect of theHowland broth itself, curves 4 and 40 thus illustrating solely the decreased turbidity obtained upon lysis of the S. epidermidis by the staphylocidin containing Howl and broth. As may be seen in the drawing, both the viability and turbidity of the S. epidermidis culture was markedly decreased after inoculation with the Howl and broth. In a further test, the activity of the Howland murein was compared with the activity of the A C murein against the S. epidermidis strain.Various dilutions of the Howl and and ATCC mureins were thus added to 1 ml of a broth suspension of the S. epidermidis strain. The samples were incubated at 350C for 3 hours, with vigorous shaking. As indicated in Table V below, the addition of the ATCC murein was found to competitively inhibit the antimicrobial activity of the Howland murein against S. epidermidis TABLE VEFFECT OF ATCC MUREIN ON THE ANTIMICROBIALACTIVITY OF HOWLAND MUREIN AGAINST S.

Thus, in a first test employing an autoclaved, undiluted broth supernatant from the fermentation of the Howland strain, no gross evidence of toxicity for13 15 gram mice injected intraperitoneally with 0.5 ml of the test material twice within 24 hours was detected. In a further experiment, it was shown that the cell murein recovered upon fermentation of a sub population of the Howland strain exhibited activity against S. aureus in the immediate treatment of a mouse surgical wound infection model, without inducing any acute toxic effects under the test conditions employed. The staphylocidin containing material was prepared from a rough phase sub population of theHowland strain deposited in the American TypeCulture Collection under ATCC 31919 . The rough phase colonies were dry, wrinkled, and crumbling with irregular edges, while the individual cells within each colony were gram positive rods, pleomorphic, with diptheroid and coccal forms as well as many filamentous forms. The cells were not acid fast. The biochemical reactivity of the rough phase sub population was similar to that of the total culture, differing only in that the rough phase gave a weak reaction in the Voges Proskauer test, and produced acid on reaction with raffinose. The rough phase cell murein exhibited the same narrow, kstive antimicrobial spectrum as the Howland murein, but only about 1 10 the antimicrobial activity thereof. Utilizing the rough phase cell murein, activity significantly greater than a placebo material, but significantly lower than a gentamicin containing topical formulation, was demonstrated in the mouse test. Administration and Use of StaphylocidinContaining Products It is presently preferred that staphylocidincontaining formulations prepared as described herein be administered topically to prevent or treat local conditions commonly attributable to staphylococci or other susceptible organisms.When so applied topically, the active material is mixed with a suitable carrier such as a cream, gel or ktim It is presently preferred to employ a gel based carrier such, for example, as an acrylic acid polymer e.g., that commercially available in 0.2 aqueous suspension as Carbopol 940 from B.F. Goodrich Corporation . In general, from about 1 to about 50 of the active material may be mixed with such a carrier to produce a suitable topical ointment. The methods for compounding, application, and administration of such topical formulations are well known in the art. The mechnSm of the antibacterial action of the preparations hereof against S.aureus andS. epidermidis is not currently known. However, a the data from murolytic enzyme digestion demonstrating the importance of intact carbohydrate bonds for activity , b the fact that staphylocidin containing products kill cell wall deficient bacteria, and c the amino acid analyses showing differences in the carbohydrate backbones of active and inactive mureins, provide evidence of the possible biological mechanism. The steps in murein biosynthesis which do not involve reactions in the cell wall but do involve intact carbohydrate bonds occur in the lipid carrier cycle. It is possible that the murein components comprising staphylocidin irreversibly bind the lipid carrier molecule, preventing transfer of subunits from the cytoplasm into the Oeflmembrane or from the membrane into the cell wall. It will of course be understood that the present invention is in no way limited by the preceding hypothesis as to the possible reaction mechanism thereof. The foregoing description of the preparation, use and application of the preferred forms of the process and compositions of the present invention is illustrative only, it being intended that the invention be limited only in accordance with the claims appended hereto.
