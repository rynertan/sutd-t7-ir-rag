# A display apparatus and a flat tube therefor.

## Abstract
A display apparatus including a modular type display tube 10 having a cathodoluminescent screen 16 an elongate thermionic or P N electron emitter 22 , a channel plate elec tron multiplier 38 and an apertured control plate 30 between the emitter 22 and the multiplier 38 . The control plate 30 has a plurality of switching elec trodes 34 on the side facing the emitter 22 and a set of brightness electrodes 36 on the opposite side and extending transverse to the switching electrodes 34 . In order to com pensate for the variations in emission from the emitters, the brightness voltage to the brightness electrodes is turned off and the emission is measured by scanning using the switching electrodes, a correction voltage is computed and is applied to gether with the modulation signal in synchronism with the scanning of the switching electrodes 34 . An apertured shield ing plate 28 is provided to avoid the stitching voltages from the switching electrodes 34 from affecting the emissions from the emitters 22 .
