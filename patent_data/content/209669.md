## Description
A DEVICE FOR CHECKING CONDENSERS AND COILS OF MOTORVEHICLES This invention, as stated in the enunciation of the description, relates to a device for checli ng condensers and coils in rotor vehicles. The object of the invention is to introduce into the market an electric device with a special arrangement of its circuits, which is substantially divided in to assembled portions, the first of which is employed to chec the condition of the condensers, veriryina the leakages existing in the same, while the second is used to check the ionization state of the coils having. the function of transforming the bat tery current in high voltage current to produce an effective spark in the sparking plugs of the engine. To this end, the leakage checking circuit used to check the condensers, is characterized in that it comprises a socket for the 220 V alternating current in the positive pole of which a switch has been arranged and then a resistor, extending in two derivations into which corresponding condensers are connected in parallel to increase the capacity of the circuit, needed to transforn the alternating current in direct current durinr its passage through the rect fier diodes that are arranged in continuation. The current goes frozen one of the condensers to an outlet branching to a contactor trou one of the poles to be checked, while the same conductor etends and passes through one of said rectifiers, continuing to connect with the negative pole of the socket and to go through the second rectifier diode, adding to the outlet of the second condenser and exiting as rectified direct current by a branch till the other contactor which is connected to the other pole of the condenser to be checked, in this outlet pole a 220 V neon lamp being arranged. All this is arranged in such a iay that when the checking of the vehicle condenser is carried out, the same is charged with current till its full capacity and no current shall pass through it. Each tine that the neon lamp lights, this means a leakage from the checked condenser, being al lowed three leakages per minute to know that the condenser can be employed. On the other hand the checking circuit for the condensers comprises a short circuited connection, actuated by means of a push button and apt to dis carGe the system and the checked condenser, and through the actuation of which the switch of the soc et in the circuit will be opened. The second portion of the circuit, that will be identified as controlled derivation circuit, is e. .ployed to verify the condition of the coils of the vehicles and is characterized in that in the outlet positive pole directly connectable wi h the coils, it comprises a wound potentiometer with a derivation to a revolution indicator and the othe derivation to the short circuit push button, whose outlet conductor is grounded to the vehicle, and further fro3 the revolution indicator exit two couplings, one for the positive terminal of the battery and the second for the negative one. All this is arranged in such a way that the checking is carried out starting the engine stabilizing its running to the optimum rpm and passing the slid in contact of the potentiometer point by point, fro nines to plus, causing in each point, by means of the push button, a short circuit that in turn tends to cause the reduction of the revolutions of the engine against the perfonnanceof the coil, so that the ionization tension of the latter is measured to supply the ignition circuit of the engine and the reserve ca paucity it contains. In order to assist the understanding of the idea set Forth, the present description is accompani ed, as an inte, atin part of the sane, by a plan in which the object of the invention has been illustrated, being it intended that the diagramatic illustrationshould not represent a limitation of the specific features of the present application. The sole figure represents a diagram of the checking circuit for condensers and coils. In this it can be noted that the circuit is divided in two portions, the first portion acting as a leakage verifier of the condenser of the vehicle, while the second portion of the circuit is the controlled derivation to check the condition of the coil of the vehicle. The leakage checking device due to verify the condition of the condensers of the vehicle, comprises a 220 V socket having a positive pole 1 and a negative pole 2 In the positive pole a switch 3 has been arranged and in continuation a resistor 4 . The circuit comprises two derivations 5 and 5 , in which two condenser in parallel 7 and 8 fizve been provided, in order to increase the capacity of the circuit This increase of the circuit capacity is necessary to transforn the alternating current in direct current during its passage through the rectifier diodes 9 and 10 which are connected as a conti nation. All this is arranged in such a way that the current goes fro the condenser 8 to a derivation 11 with exit to a contactor 12 at one of the poles of the condenser of the vehicle to be checked. The sane conductor of the derivation 5 e. tends and goes through said rectifier 9 till it connects to the negative pole 13 of the socket and goes through the second diode 10 adding to the outlet of the second condenser 7 and exiting as a rec tried direct current through a derivation 14 till the other contactor 15 which is connected to the other pole of the condenser to be checked. To this exit pole a 220 V neon lamp 16 is connected, which signals the leakages existing in the checked condenser. What happens is that during the checking of the vehlcle condenser, this is charged by the current as much as allowed by its capacity and no current shall pass through it. When there is a leakage in the checked condenser, the neon lamp will signal it, only three leakages per minute being allowed to show that the checX ed condenser is in a good condition for its use. On the other hand, the checking circuit for tne condensers comprises a short circuited connection 17 actuated by nears of a push button 1Q . Actuating the push button of the short circuited connection, the discharge of the system and of the chewed condenser will be produced, but previously by the same the supply switch 3 of the circuit will be opened. The second portion of the circuit or controlled derivation circuit, is employed to check the coils of the vehicles. To this end the exit positive pole of the circuit 15 is connected. to the coil of the vehicle directly and to this pole a wound potentiometer 19 is connected,which is only a resistore adjustable as desired. Said potentiometer presents a derivation 20 to a revolution indicator 21 and another derivation which pertains to the short circuits 17 actuatable by the push button 18 , whose connection or exit pole 12 is grounded to the vehicle. Two couplings 22 and 23 , respectively, exit from the revolution indicator 21 , for the connection with the positive and negative terminals of the vehicle battery. All this is arranged in such a way that the check of the vehicle coil is carried out starting the engine, which stabilizes to an optimum. rpm. When the speed of the engine is stabilized, the potentiofleter 1 is actuated displacing its sliding contact from minus to plus, causing in every point a short circuit by means of the push button 18 . Said short circuit tends in turn to cause a redution of the revolutions of the engine, against the performance of the coil, so that the ionization tension of the same is measured, which will state if it is in a good condition, in order to transform the battery current in high voltage current to produce an effective spark in the sparking plugs of the engine. Having described the present invention, it must be noted that the details of the invention can be modified, that is they are subject to minor variations always based on the essential principles of this invention, which substantially are those stated in the paragraphs of the above description.
