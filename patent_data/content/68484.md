# Carbon based soldering and de soldering tip and method of manufacturing same.

## Abstract
A soldering or de soldering tip and method of ma nufacturing a soldering or de soldering tip which has a carbon body with an attachment portion, an intermediate portion adjoining the attachment portion, and a solder wetting portion adjoining the intermediate portion. The solder wetting portion has an exterior coating of iron to provide a wettable working surface, and the intermediate portion has an exterior coating of chrome for localizing the wettable working surface and impeding the upward flow of solder along the intermediate portion and toward the attachment portion. The carbon body eliminates premature failure problems caused by the pitting and oxidation of standard copperbased tips.
