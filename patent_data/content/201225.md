## Description
The present invention relates to mixtures of chromogens that are especially useful as colour formers in carbon less copying systems. Chromogenic mixtures that form black shades are highly desirable for use in pressure sensitive carbonless record ing systems. Black images have superior reproduction characteristics when copied by xerographic processes. Additionally, black images provide excellent contrast, readability and are similar in appearance to traditional typewritten copy. In the context of carbonless systems, the term black refers to shades that range from dark gray to black in appearance and that are characterized by approximately straight line absorption throughout the entire visible range, approximately 400 700 millimicrons. The traditional carbonless recording system includes a top sheet that is coated on its back surface CB with a multitude of microcapsules containing a marking liquid and a bottom sheet coated on its front CF with an acidic material, such as an acidic clay or a phenolic resin, that reacts with the normally colourless marking fluid upon rupture of the CB microcapsules to form an image on the CF. The marking fluid contained in the microcapsules coated on the CB is typically a mixture of chromogenic materials dissolved within a carrier oil or fluid. Zinc modified phenolic resins are now widely favoured as the acidic material coated on the CF. This is due to their high reactivity, stabilizing effect on the formed images with respect to light and dark exposure and their low abrasiveness on paper coating equipment. However, zinc modified phenolic resins display an unexpected inability to synergistically react with many mixtures of two or more chromogens. Rather, most blends of chromogens when imaged on zinc modified pheno lic resins show antagonism with respect to the imaging properties of each other resulting in undesirable shades, poor intensity, or both. This antagonism problem is particularly evident in chromogenic blends intended to form black images. To date, the traditional solution to this problem has been the use of so called single component black pre cursors. These chromogens are generally blackish green coloured fluorans that are used alone or in combination with small amounts 5 20 by weight of toner chromogens in order to achieve a preferred black shade and to avoid the blending antagonism caused by zinc modified phenolic resins. However, the use of single component blacks is undesirable from a commercial standpoint since they are generally quite expensive and must be applied in relatively large amounts. Thus, there is a need for a chromogenic mixture that will produce a black shaded image with zinc modified phenolic resins while avoiding the antagonistic blending characteristics of such resins and at the same time eliminating or substantially reducing the amount of single component black chromogen used. Most chromogenic mixtures include crystal violet lactone 3, 3 bis p dimethylamino phenyl , 6 dimethyl amino phthalide as one of the chromogenic components. For example, U.S. Patents Nos. 4,376,150 Morita et al. 4,180,405 Lawton and 4,168,845 Oeda et al. all disclose chromogenic mixtures including, It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved chromogenic mixture. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a mixture of chromogens capable of forming a black shade when reacted with a zinc modified phenolic resin in a carbonless copy system. It is another object of the present invention to provide a substantially colourless marking liquid composition containing a mixture of chromogens dissolved in an organic oil that is capable of procuding a black image when reacted with a zinc modified phenolic resin in a carbon less copy system. According to the present invention there is provided a chromogenic mixture that includes at least three compon ents, the first component being a blue, indigo or violet chromogen that should be present in an amount of approxim ately 5 to 60 by weight, the second chromogenic compo nent being a green or single component black chromogen that is present in the mixture in an amount of approxim ately 30 to 70 by weight characterised by the provision of a third component being an orange chromogen having the following formula Further objects and embodiments of the present invention will become clear in the following description of the preferred embodiments and claims. The orange chromogens that may form the first component of the inventive chromogenic mixture, alone or in combination, all have the following formula With respect to the blue, indigo or violet chromogen, three preferred candidates, which may be used alone or in combination, are crystal violet lactone, 6 dimethyl amino, bis 3 dimethylaminophenyl, 1,3, dimethylamino phenyl phthalide and 1 , 3 , 6 8 tetra dimethyl aminophenyl phthalide. Most preferably, crystal violet lactone is used as the blue, indigo or violet chromogen since it is highly reactive, widely available and relatively low in cost. The blue, indigo or violet chromogen should be present in an amount of approximately 5 to 60 based on a total weight of the chromogenic mixture. Most preferably, the blue, indigo or violet chromogen may be present in an amount of approximately 10 to 20 by weight. With respect to the green or single component black chromogen that forms the third component of the inventive chromogenic mixture, there are four preferred compounds, which may be used alone or in combination. The first is a single component black chromogen, 2 phenylamino , 3 methyl, 6 N ethyl, N p tolylamino fluoran. The second is a green chromogen, 2 N methyl, N phenylamino , 6 N ethyl, N p tolylamino fluoran. These two chromo gens are the most preferred green or single component black chromogens. The third preferred chromogen is a green chromogen, 2 bis phenyl methylamino , 4 methyl, 6 diethylamino fluoran. The fourth chromogen is a single component black chromogen, 2 phenylamino, 3 methyl, 6 N methyl, N cyclohexylamino fluoran. The selected green or single component black chromogen may be present in the inventive chromogenic mixture in an amount of approximately 30 to 70 based on the total weight of the mixture. Most preferably, the selected green or single component black chromogen may be present in an amount from 45 to 60 by weight. To form the inventive chromogenic mixtures, one or more of the chromogens from each of the three classes is selected and the chromogens are mixed together in the indicated amounts. In the context of carbonless copy systems, the chromogenic mixtures will generally be dissolved in an appropriate organic oil vehicle that is then microencapsulated and coated as a CB. Any of the numerous organic solvents or oils generally known in the carbonless art may be used to make a colourless marking liquid composition with the inventive chromogenic mixtures, e.g. diisopropyl napthalene, diarylethane and diaryl methane. A chromogenic mixture was prepared containing 35 6 diethyl amino, 1 , 3 dimethyl fluoran, 20 crystal violet lactone, and 45 2 N methyl, N phenylamino , 6 N ethyl, N p tolylamino fluoran based on the total weight of the chromogenic mixture. This mixture was then dissolved in an appropriate organic solvent in an amount of approximately 7 by weight based on the total weight of the solution to form a colourless liquid marking composition. This marking composition was microencapsulated, coated on paper as a CB and then imaged against a CF coated with zinc modified phenolic resin as the reactive acidic material. The absorbance values shown in Table 1 were obtained on the Bausch Lomb Opacimeter and the Hunter colorimeter for the formed images. A second chromogenic mixture was formed with 24 6 diethylamino, 1 , 3 dimethyl fluoran, 16 crystal violet lactone, and 60 2 phenylamino , 3 methyl, 6 N ethyl, N p tolylamino fluoran based on the total weight of the chromogenic mixture. This chromogenic mixture was then dissolved in an appropriate organic solvent to form a colorless liquid marking composition having approximately 6 chromogenic mixture based on the total weight of the solution. The solution was also microencapsulated, coated on paper as a CB and then imaged against a CF coated with zinc modified phenolic resin to form black appearing images. The images yielded the values shown in Table 2 on the B L Opaci meter and the Hunter Colorimeter. As shown in Figure 2, the liquid marking composition showed absorbance throughout the visible range upon spectrophotometric analysis. Similar tests have been performed with 2 t butyl, 6 diethyl amino fluoran and 6 diethyl amino, 3 methyl fluoran yeilding similarly satisfactory results. Thus, the inventive chromogenic mixtures form black images of suitable commercial intensity when inaged against CF sheets coated with zinc modified phenolic resins.
