# JOINTS FOR OPTICAL FIBER TELECOMMUNICATION SUBMARINE CABLES

## Abstract
A joint for optical fiber telecomunication submarine cables according to the invention provides for a metal ferrule 17 that butt connects the mechanically resistant armours 18, 19 of two cables 15, 16 constituted by metal wires and the like that occupy the radially innermost position of the cables themselves. Around the ferrule there is a joint core 20 of plastic material in which there are through cavities 23 filled with an incompressible fluid that loosely house the extremities 26 of the optical fibers of the cables and their connections 27 . A joint sheath 28 of plastic material encircles the core and is connected to the plastic material sheaths of the cables 15, 16 .
