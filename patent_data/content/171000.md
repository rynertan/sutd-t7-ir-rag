## Description
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING HETEROLOGOUS MATURED PROTEIN OR PEPTIDE This invention relates to a method of producing a matured protein or peptide. In particular, this invention relates to a method of producinng a matured protein or a matured peptide which comprises transforming yeast with an expression vector capable of extracellularly secreting a heterologous protein or peptide produced in yeast cells, immobilizing the yeast transformant onto a carrier gel, culturing the immobilized transformant yeast, and isolating and purifying the matured protein or pep tide from the culture solution. In recent years, attempts have been made to produce in a large amount an effective physiological active substance originating from humans or animals by using recombinant DNA technology. However, there are scarcely any production examples which use a vector capable of secreting a heterologous substance protein or peptide produced in a cell outwardly thereof, particularly into a culture medium.It is extremely important in practice to secretively produce the desired heterologous protein or peptide outward the cell in a periplasm or a medium because of the small amountof impurities involved when purifying the substance. Some examples of proteins or peptides which have been secretively produced from a yeast outwardly of the cell have been reported. Substances secreting into a periplasm include as representatives an acid phosphatase and an invertase. A N glycosylation may be recognized in any of these enzyme proteins. On the other hand, a factor MFa , a factor and a killer factor are known as substances which may be secreted into a medium. The present inventors paid attention to these proteins and peptides secretively produced from a yeast and investigated the production of an expression vector for secretively producing a heterologous protein or peptide outside the yeast cell by employing a DNA sequence coding for the genes of these substances. The mechanisms of the secretor expression in a natural yeast are broadly classified into two groups. The first is a secretion by a signal peptide. As a signal peptide, the substances employed are derived from an acid phosphatase, and the signal peptide is cleaved when passing through the inner cell membrane. There have been some reports about the secretive production of, for ex p,. a human interferon with use of a signal peptide derived from an animal cell Science, 219, 620 625 1983 . According to these reports, the secretive activity is 10 30 relative expression is recognized, the processing of the signal peptide is not always brought about at a correct site, causing the processing of about half the molecules to be brought about at different sites. Therefore, this secretion is not said to be practical with regard to the production of a single substance. The second case is accompanied with the particular processing shown in the secretion of MFa. In this case, the precursor of the precursor of MFa 165 amino acid residues is first cleaved at the site of Lys Arg and then the precursor tEa containing 17 or 19 additional amino acid residues is produced. Then the peptide composed of repeating Glu Ala two or three times, which is bonded. to the.Ntermiial, is subjected to digestion with diaminopeptidase to release a matured MF into a culture medium Julius, D., etc., Cell, 32, 839 852 1983 . The present inventors investigated the possibility of production of a secretor expression vector which employs the latter secretory system and thereby found that this system could be appropriately applied to the secretor expression of a heterologous protein or peptide, resulting in the completion of the present invention. The advantages of the secretor expression vector constructed by employing this system are as follows 1 The desired peptide can be stably produced even in a case where it has a small molecular weight. 2 The production of the desired protein or peptide bas no affect on its amino acid composition. The generally used method in which an expressed protein or peptide is treated by CNBr for example, insulin A chain, insulin B chain, somatostatin and neoendorphin cannot be applied if a methionine residue is present in the desired substance which means that the species of substances obtainable is limited. However, in the system employed in the present invention, there is no such limitation. 3 The addition of a sugar chain to the desired substance protein or peptide can be expected during the secretion process. 4 Since the protein or peptide containing the desired substance produced by the secretor expression vector is subjected to special processing, no f Met or Met is added to a N terminal which, if it occurred, would become a problem in the direct expression. Furthermore, the extracellular secretion of the desired substance gives the following advantages 5 It is even possible to produce a desired substance which is harmful to a host cell because of the gradual release thereof from cells. 6 A contineous culture is possible and purification of the desired products is easy. 7 It is possible to culture a host yeast in an immobilized state and to simplify the production process. The present invention, having these numerous advantages, will now be explained with reference to the production of a neoendorphin aNE , which is a peptide hormone, as a heterologous peptide and of interleukin 2 E2 which is substance related to immunity. However, the present invention can be applied to the production of many other useful proteins or peptides, for example, insulin, somatostatine, growth hormone, growth hormone stimulating factor, and diuretic hormone which are peptide hormones of humans and mammals y type interferon, tumor necrosis factor TNF and lymphotoxin and various interferons having anti virus activities which are immune related substances. In the present invention, the DNA sequence wading for the desired substance, which is used for constructing a secretor expression vector in a host yeast, may be selected from chemically synthesized DNA sequences, complementaryDNA obtained by a reverse transcriptase frorm mRNA, and DNA sequences obtained from chromosomes by suitable treatment, depending on the case. The secretor expression vector in the present invention is constructed by inserting a DNA sequence coding for the desired substance in the place of all or a part of a DNA sequence coding for a matured MFa peptide in MFa operon.That is to say, the DNA sequence coding for the desired substance is joined to a site downstream from the DNA sequence coding for the signal peptide of MFa operon, a poly peptide capable of having a sugar chain added to it, and a peptide containing a structure wherein Glu Ala is repeated two to three times and containing Lys Arg which it is possible to remove .A promoter for expressing such a fused gene is selected from a promoter of MFa operon described in the Examples hereunder, a promoter of another yeast having a strong activity, for example, a promoter of the gene controlling the glycolytic pathway enzyme of an yeast such as glyceraldehyde 3 phosphodehydrogenase GAPDH , 3 phosphoglycerokinase PGK , hexokinase, and apratot er for the gene controlling an inducibly expressed enzyme such as a repressible acid phosphatase for example, PH05 . As described above, since the desired substance protein or peptide can be secretively produced in the medium by culturing the yeast which has been transformed by the vector constructed according to this invention, it is possible to continuously produce the desired substance by immobilizing transformant cells on a suitable carrier and culturing them. Furthermore, it is possible according to this invention to produce proteins or peptides with sugar chains by using the secretor expression vector of the present invention. Thus, the present invention provides a method for efficiently producing heterologous proteins or peptides in large amounts. Fig. 1 shows the scheme for constructing a plasmid pYMF88 by inserting the DNA fragment of about 1.4 Kb which had been obtained by digesting all of the DNA of yeastX2180 1B wth EcoRI SalI into the EcoRI SalI DNA fragment of pBR322.

Fig. 19 is a graph showing the change with passage of time of secretor expression of IL2 of aNE produced by immobilizing the transformed yeast produced by the present invention. An factor MFa gene was isolated and its structure was reported by J. Kurjan and I. Herskowitz cedd, 30, 933 943 in 1982. According to this reference, four DNA sequences coding for the matured factor, each of which is composed of 13 amino acid residues, are lined in tandem through DNA sequences coding for special spacer peptides.The present inventors therefore deduced that proteins or peptides coded with a foreign heterologous gene can be extracellularly produced by a host yeast if the heterologous gene is inserted to exchange for all of or a part of theDNA sequence coding for the matured MFa peptide. According to Kurjan, et al. described above, since the MFa operon gene is present in the EcoRI fragment 1.7 Kb of a yeast chromosome and there is a SalI cutting site at 36bp downstream from the termination codon of the MFa gene, it is to be expected that the MFa gene is carried on the EcoRI SalI fragment of about 1.4 Kb. Therefore, all the DNA components were isolated from the a mating type strain X2180 lB yeast IdATa SUC2 mal gall2 CUP1 yeast genetic stock center available from University of California, Berkley School,CA 94720 , purified and then digested by using EcoRI andSalI to collect DNA fragments of about 1.4 Kb. The DNA fragment was jointed to a DNA sequence containing ss ladctamase gene Ampr and a replicon obtained from pBR322 by digestion with EcoRI and SalI and then Escherichia coli JA221 is transformed with the constructed plasmid. Plasmid DNAs were separated from the transformant having an ampicillin resistance by a convenient method, and a plasmid which will form fragments of about 1.2 1.3 Kb by digestion with EcoRI andHindIII was selected.The salI cutting site of this plasmid was labelled with 32P and the DNA base sequence was determined by the MAXAM GILBERT method to confirm that the plasmid pYMF88 containing the DNA fragment equal to the MFa gene obtained by Kurjan et al. was obtained Fig. 1 . TheEscherichia coli transformed by this plasmid JA221 pYMF88 is called SBM276 and is deposited with Fermentation ResearchInstitute, Japan deposit No. FERM P 7735 InternationalDeposition Acceptance No. FERM BP 837 under the BudapestTreaty . On the other hand, a secretor vector for expression of an heterologous foreign gene pYE2411 was constructed according to the process shown in Fig. 2. A Shuttle vector PYE2001 is first formed from a yeast of 2 vm DNA, plasmidYR 7 containing the TRP1 gene and pBR322 through pYE2001, p and then the Hind III fragment of plasmid pYGAP87 refer toJapanese Patent Public Disclosure No. 74986 1984 Escherichia coli containing pYGAP87 in which a yeast GAP DH gene has been cloned was called SMB151 and given InternationalDeposition Acceptance No. FERM BP 382 by FermentationResearch Institute, Japan was inserted into the HindIII site near IR1 of pYE2001 pYE2201 . Subsequently, yYE2203 was constructed by the process shown in Fig. 2 through pYE2202 and the EcoRI SalI fragment containing the MFa gene of pYMF88 previously cloned was inserted in the place of theEcoRI SalI fragment containing GAP DH gene region not containing a 3 terminal non translation region TGAP ofGAP DH gene on pYE2203 to obtain a shuttle vector pYE2411 for secretor expression of the desired heterologous protein or peptide .The plasmid is one produced so as to express a heterologous, exogenous gene under the control of the promoter of MFa gene and to add 3 terminal non translation region TGAp of GAP DH gene to the downstream of a heterologous exogenous gene. Furthermore, Escherichia coli transformed by pYE2411 is called SMB275 and is deposited with Fermentation Research Institute Deposition No. FERM P 7728 International Deposition Acceptance No. FERM BP 836 . The capability of secretor expression of an exogenous gene was then investigated. First, the DNA sequence coding for a a neoendorphine aNE 10 amino acid residues was used as a physiological active peptide having a molecular size nearly equal, to the matured MFa peptide for the purposes of the investigation. Furthermore, the DNA sequence coding for the Met aNE 11 amino acid residues , in which one methionine residue was added to the N terminal of aNE in order to investigate the chemical process by CNBr, was exchanged for the DNA sequence coding for the matured a peptide so as to investigate the expression in yeast cells.Each one of four matured m DNA sequences was exchanged for the Met a NE gene to construct four plasmids of pY NE412, pMaNE413, pYaNE 414 and pY alpha NE415 Fig. 4 . The aNE gene used was one in which the cohesive ends of HindIII andBamHI were joined by T4 DNA ligase to the terminals of theDNA sequence chemically synthesized by the triester method Fig. 3 .The plasmids obtained in such a manner are pYaNE4l2, pYaNE413, pYaNEl4l and pYaNE415 which are expressed to produce a protein which does not contain the matured MFa and is composed of 100 amino acid residues a protein containing one molecule of the matured MFa and composed of 121 amino acid residues a protein containing 2 molecules of the matured MFa and composed of 142 amino acid residues and a protein containing 3 molecules of the maturedMFa and composed of 162 amino acid residues, respectively.These plasmids are transformed into suitable host yeasts, for example, a mating type of saccharmyces yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae XS16 lB MATa lue2 trpl his3 . When the trans formant obtained is cultured in a suitable medium, the desired substance aNE is found to be secreted. The Trp transformant is selected from the special transformants described above, and is cultured in a minimal medium containing 2 Casamino acid 0.67 Difco Nitrogen base, 2 glucose at 300C and then the cells and the supernatant liquid are separated. The aNE content of each of them can be measured to determine the productivity. As will be explained in detail by the Examples hereunder, the secretor expression of aNE was observed for any plasmid replaced with any of the above explained part of the DNA sequences coding for the matured MFoi as shown inTable 1. In the cell growth phase of the transformed yeast 9.5 hours logarithmic growth metaphase , 19 38 of the total of aNE produced is secreted. However, the secretory ratio in a stationary phase 24 hours is as low as 3.3 11 .Furthermore, the time dependent changes of the aNE amounts produced in the cells and in the culture medium are shewn inFig. 5. The aNE amount produced in the cells increases in proportion to the cell growth but its accumulation is observed even after the proliferation rate began to decrease after 8 hours . This is believed to be caused by the degree of secretion, which does not correspond to the expressed amount. On the other hand, the aNE amount in the culture medium is not found to change after 6 hours, which is thought to be attributable to the decomposition of the secreted aNE in the medium. The secretion amount is not said to be sufficient, but these characteristics are suitable for continuously culturing the transformed yeast in an immobilized state as explained below. Next, a comparison of aNE component secreted into the culture medium aNE or Met aNE treated with CNBr with one which has not been treated with CNBr is carried out by radioimmunoassary using an aNE antibody. As seen from the results shown in Table 2, the aNE amounts determined in both cases are nearly equal with respect to yeasts transformed by any of the above explained plasmid. This indicates that the Met ciNE pre proprotein produced in the cells is subjected to processing during secretion and mature Met aNE peptide is secreted in the medium. The DNA sequence corresponding to the gene coding for the matured human interleukin 2 IL2 having a molecular weight higher than that of aNE was chemically synthesized see Figs. 7 and 8 and used for experiments in the same manner as for aNE. The chemically sunthesized DNA sequence coding for IL2 is shown in Fig. 6 and is called SUN IL2.The process for constructing a vector pYIL241 for secretively expressing IL2 is shown in Figs. 9 and 11, but the details will be explained by Examples hereunder. In the same manner as in the case of aNE, IL2 is secreted in the culture medium and thus the secretion was found to be a proliferation dependent type see Fig. 12 . Furthermore, aa shown in Figs. 15 to 18, separation and purification of IL2 from the culture solution described above and investigation of the physicochemical properties were carried out. What is interesting here is that the fraction having the IL2 activity which is adsorbed to ConA Sepharose and is eluted with a methyl mannoside was obtained from the components secreted into the medium, as shown in Fig. 16.This strongly suggests that the yeast transformed with pYIL241 secretes in the culture medium IL2 to which saccharide was added. Furthermore, by the chromatofocusing shown in Fig.15, the IL2 activity was detected to have almost a single peak at a pH around 6.7, but by the ion exchange column chromatography DEAE Toyopearl shown in Fig. 17, the IL2 activity was detected as being a broad peak exhibiting two maximums. By a hydrophobic chromatography of the IL2 active fraction obtained by the above described DEAE Toyopearl column chromatography, the active fraction showed the same property of having two maximums as is shown in Fig. 18. The yeast transformed by the secretor expression vector of the present invention is useful for producing the desired substance on an industrial scale, when a continuous culture is carried out by the immobilized yeast method which is used for, e.g., ethanol fermentation with a yeast. In particular, it is suitable for a continuous immobilized yeast culture when the MEW promoter is used because the expression of the desired substance is recognized in the logarithmic growth phase. Of course, it is also possibleto. carry out the continuous culture of immobilized yeast by the use of the secretive expression system of this invention, even if a suitable promoter other than the MFa promoter is used. In case where a promoter of an inducible expression type of gene such as repressible yeast acid phosphatase PH05 gene is used, it is possible to culture the transformed yeast under non inducing conditions for PH05, in a medium having a high concentration of phosphate , immobilize the cultured cells, and transfer the immobilized cells under inducing conditions for PH05, in a low phosphate medium so that the desired matured protein or peptide can be continuously produced in the cultuture medium. The transformed yeast of the present invention is immobilized by entrapping cells with various carriers of the generally known substances such as carrageenan, MCM, gelatin, cellulose triacetate, and polycarbonate. The desired substance can be produced by continuous culture by using the immobilized yeast. The case of K carrageenan which is simply referred to as carrageenan hereunder will be explained below. The MetNE or IL2 secretively producing strains which were proliferated to about 107 cells per 1 ml are mixed with a 4.0 carrageenan solution at 37 390C so as to adjust the cell concentration of the mixture to 5 x 107 cells per 1 ml. The mixed solution is dropwisely added to a 0.3N KC1 aqueous solution to entrap the yeast with carrageenan. The immobilized yeast is added to a minimal medium containing 2 Casamino acid and cultured with shaking at 300C for 24 hours. Then, the yeast is transferred into the same but fresh medium, and this point is regarded as 0 hour for the purposes of investigating change with the passage of time. The culture is carried out with shaking at 300 C, no medium being added during this stage. As shown in Fig. 19, the production of IL2 reaches a stationary state at the 6th hour, while it decreases at 2 hours and later in the case of Met alpha NE. It can tbfora be deduced from the results of the IL2 production that altb h the secretive expression lasts for 6 hours even with respect to Met alpha NE, the decomposition thereof is thought to take place in the culture medium faster than the secretion rate after 2 hours, causing the activity to be decreased. On the other hand, in IL2 production, IL2 can be produced by a continuous culture in which an exhausted medium is exchanged for the same amount of a fresh one every 6 hours. Furthermore, it is possible to continuously produce a substance having a low molecular weight such as Met alpha NE by incorporating a suitable decomposition inhibitor in the medium. The present invention will be illustrated on detail by the Example below.Example 1 Cloning of MF alpha genes Fig. 1 a Mating type of haploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae X2180 1B MAT alpha SUC2 mal gall2 CUP1, available from YeastGenetic Stock Center, R. Mortimer, University of California,Berkeley, CA 94720 was cultured with shaking in 400 ml ofYEPD medium 1 yeast extract, 2 peptone, 2 glucose at 300C for 24 hours and the cells were collected by a centrifuge. DNA was separated from the cells and purified according to the method of D. R. Cryer, et al. Methods in CellBiology, 12, 39, Academic press 1975 . The DNA 50 ug was completely digested with use of 200 units of EcoRI and 200 units of SalI and a DNA fragment of about 1.4 Kb was separated by agar gel electrophoresis.Then the agar gel was cut out and the desired DNA fragment was isolated from the gel by the electroelute method, extracted with phenol, and then precipitated with ethanol. On the other hand, 1 g of pBR322 was completely digested by using 4 units of EcoRI and 6 units of SalI and a DNA fragment of 3.7 Kb was recovered by the method described before. Then both of these fragments were mixed, dissolved in 20 1 of a ligation reaction solution 20 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2 10 mMDTT, 1 mM ATP , and reacted with 2 units of T4DNA ligase at 150C for 16 hours.To 10 1 of the reaction solution was added Escherichia coli JA221 cultured to OD660 0.5 in LB medium 1 trypton, 0.5 yeast extract 0.5 NaCl, pH 7.5 suspended in 0.3 ml of a 50 mM CaCl2 solution and abcowed to stand at 0 C for 40 minutes for transformation. Then, 2.5 ml of the LB medium was added and cultured with shaking at 370C for 1.5 hours and the obtained solution was spread on a neutrient agar plate containing 50 Vg ml of ampicillinto culture the transformant at 370C overnight. Theplasmid DNA was separated from the cultured ampicillin resistant transformant by alkali extraction according to the conventional method and analyzed with use of restriction enzymes.A clone containing a plasmid which can be digested with EcoRI and Hind III to give a fragment ca. 1.3 Kb and has at least one PstI cutting site was obtained in a proportion of 2 clones out of 300 ampicillin resistant transformants. The plasmid obtained from one clone from amongst them was cleaved with SalI, subjected to BAP alkaline phosphatase derived from E. coli treatment to remove phosphoric acid at 5 terminal, and determined its DNA sequence labelling the plasmid with 32 at 5 terminal and using gamma 32P ATP andT4 polynucleotidekinase by the Maxam Gilbert method Meth. Enzym., 65, 499 560 1980 . The results showed that the sequence was in conformity with that of the MF alpha gene separated by Kurjan and Herskowitz Cell, 30, 933 943 1982 . The plasmid was named as pYMF88. The plasmid was called SBM151 and deposited with Fermentation Research Institute, Japan International Deposition Acceptance No. FERM BP 382 underBudapest Treaty . 2 Construction of a NE secretor expression vector Fig. 2, Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 A plasmid pYE2411 in which a EcoRI SalI DNA fragment of pYMF88 containing the promoter region and the structural gene of MFa as described in 1 above was inserted in a yeast Escherichia coli shuttle vector was constructed by the method described below.A DNA fragment of 2.2 Kb containing a 2 vmDNA replication which was obtained by cleaving 2 mDNA with EcoRI was joined with a DNA fragment of 0.85 Kb obtained by digesting YRp7 Struhl, K., etc., PNAS, 76, 1035 1039 1979 with EcoRI and BglII and with a 4.0 Kb fragment obtained by digesting pBR322 with EcoRI and BamHI to construct a plasmid pYE2001. This plasmid had twoEcoRI cutting sites, and, after cleaving the plasmid withEcoRI, both cohesive ends were filled in by using T4DNA polymelase and 4dNTP and were then ligated with T4DNA ligase to eliminate the EcoRI cutting site because of the inconvenience which would otherwise be involved with the subsequent plasmid construction.Thus, a plasmid pTE2001 without having EcoRI cutting site was constructed. Then, in order to add a terminator region of GAP DH gene to the plasmid, the GAP DH gene was obtained by cleaving pYGAP87 see Japanese Patent Public Disclosure No. 74986 1984 byHind III, and this was joined to a fragment which had been obtained by partially cleaving pYE2001 with HindIII to construct pYE2201. The SalI cutting site near the TRP1 gene of pYE2201 was then eliminated in the same manner as before to give pYE2202. The plasmid pYE2202 was partially cleaved with HindIII and joined again through an EcoRI linker so that pYE2203 in which the EcoRI cutting site was formed at a site immediately upstream of the GAP DH gene was obtained. The MFa gene was obtained by cleaving pYMF88 constructed in Item 1 with EcoRI and SalI and was joined to a DNA fragment which had been obtained by decomposing pYE2203 with EcoRI and SalI thereby constructing pYE2411. The plasmid pYE2411 has a structure in which preMFa is transcribed by the function of the promoter of MF and completed by the terminator of theGAP DH gene.The plasmid is a shuttle vector which contains a replicon of pBR322 and is selected by S lactamase gene in an Escherichia coli host, and which contains a 2 vm DNA replicon and is selected by TRP1 gene in a yeast host.The Escherichia coli JA221 transformed by pYE2411 was calledSMB275 and deposited with Fermentation Research Institute,Japan deposition number FERM P 7728, International Deposi tion Acceptance No. FERM BP 836 . 3 Construction of aNE expressing vector The construction of an expressionvector of aNE which is a low molecular weight peptide will be explained below.An aNE gene added a codon ATG corresponding to irethonihe was used so as to make cleavage of the produced protein withCNBr possible. The base sequence is shown in Fig. 3. The upper stream region of aNE gene has a Hind III cohesive end and is designed such that the reading frames are matched when it is joined to HindIII cutting site in MFa NE gene.Furthermore, when it is joined to any of four HindIII cutting sites located immediately Upper stream of the DNA coding for MFa which are present in the MFa gene, the reading frames can be matched with each other. This aNE gene was obtained by chemically synthesizing 8 DNA fragments F1 F8 as shown in Fig. 3 by the method described inJapanese Patent Public Disclosure No. 63395 1983, joining these fragments with T4DNA ligase, and then separating and purifying the resulting aNE gene by using a polyacrylamide gel.Since the BamHI cohesive end sequence is located at the downstream of the aNE gene, the SalI cutting site of the vector pYE2411 to be inserted was changed into the BamHI cutting site to construct pYE2411 BamHI Fig. 4 . That is to say, 5 vg of pYE2411 was cleaved by using 20 units ofSalI, and after filling in the SalI cohesive end by usingT4DNA polymelase and 4dNTP, the BamHI linker was added to construct pYE2411 BamHI by the method previously described.On the other hand, 15 g of pYMF88 was completely cleaved by using 60 units of EcoRI and then partially cleaved at 370C for 15 minutes by using 1 unit of Hind III. The reaction solution was separated by agar gel electrophresis and thereby a DNA fragments corresponding to about 1.3 Kb to about 1.5 Kb were obtained by the method previously described.They were mixed with 0.1 g of a ligase reaction solution and reacted by using 5 units of T4DNA ligase at 150C for 16 hours. The Escherichia coli JA221 was transformed by using 10 il of the ligated substance to obtain an ampicillin resistance clone. The analysis was carried out by using several restriction enzymes in accordance with the conventional method. The results showed that clones containing pYaNE412, pYaNE4l3, pYaNE414 and pYaNE415 were produced Fig. 4 . 4 Secretor expression of pYaNE4l2, pYNE4l3, pYaNE414 and pYaNE415 The plasmid obtained in Item 3 was used to transform haploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae XS16 lB MATa leu2 his3 trpl in accordance with the general method to obtain TRP clone. A TRP clone transformed with pYE2411 was also obtained to be used for comparison. The transformants obtained were cultured with shaking in the CA medium 0.6 Difco Nitrogen base w o amino acid, 2 glucose, 2 Casamino acid at 30 C. The results obtained from the assay of the aNE activity are shown in Table 1, with respect to the 9.5 hour logarithmic growth phase and the 24 hour stationary phase cultures.This assay was carried out by RIA using an antibody against aNE in accordance with the method described in Japanese Patent Public Disclosure No. 63395 1983. The cells and the culture supernatant were separated by centrifuging 1 ml of the culture solution sampled at each phase. at 10,000 rpm for 5 minutes. The cells were treated with CNBr in accordance with the method described inJapanese Patent Public Disclosure No. 63395 1983, and used as a sample. The culture supernatant liquid per se was used as a sample. Table 1 shows the aNE activity in terms of 1 ml of the culture liquid. No aNE activity was detected in the transformant with pYE2411 which was constructed for catpa ison. The cell proliferation corresponded to OD660 3.5 in 9.5 hours and OD6b0 n 15 in 24 hours. The secretion ratio Secretion in Table 1 was calculated by dividing the value of the culture supernatant liquid activity by the sum of the cell activity and the culture supernatant liquid activity. The sample at 9.5 hour cultivation exhibited a secretion ratio of 19 38 . The secretion ratio was decreased to 3.3 11 on 24 hour cultivation, but the cellular activity per cell per OD660 was essentially the same as 9.5 hours.Therefore, although the secretor expres sion was recognized even if a gene coding for a desired protein or peptide is inserted at any of four sites each of which is the starting site of a DNA sequence coding for matured MFa, the insertion at an upstream site showed a tendency to increase the secretion efficiency. A comparison with the sample treated with CNBr was then carried out with respect to the activity of the culture supernatant. The RIA of the sample which was treated withCNBr by dissolving in a 70 formic acid solution containing 5 mg ml of CNBr after freeze drying the supernatant liquid of the sample incubated for 24 hours was ca paredwith that of the sample not treated with CNBr. The results are shown inTable 2. From the results the reactivities with the aNE antibody showed nearly the same values. It was found from these results that processings during secretor expressing were correctly made. The change with passing of time was investigated by using the transformed yeast XS16 lB pYaNE412 . The shaking culture was carried out at 300C by using the CA medium. The results are shown in Table 5. The cell proliferation is represented by the value of OD660 and theaNE activity is shown as the result from RIA by the same method as before.Although the intracellular aNE value increases in close correspondence with proliferation of cells that is to say, the aNE value per cell was the same , the activity in the culture supernatant did not show a remarkable increase.The intracellular activity level was also decreased with 24 hour cultivation. These results show that the aNE was decomposed in the medium. It is however believed that the problem can be solved by using a suitable decomposition inhibitor in the culture medium. The secretor expression using the MFa gene system was investigated with respect to a protein having a high molecular weight by using IL2 which is an immune related substance. 5 Chemical synthesis of IL2 gene Fig. 6 to Fig. 8 The human IL2 is a polypeptide consisting of 133 amino acid residues and its amino acid sequence was determined by gene analysis Taniguchi, et al., Nature, 302, 305 310 1983 .1 An optimal codon of a yeast was selected as the o bn corresponding to each amino acid as much as practicable.2 Met was coded immediately before Ala at NdkzmbYl ofIL2 and a terminating codon TAA was introduced jirrndiately after Thr of the C terminal.3 The EcoRI cohesive end was added to the strand 5 terminal of the synthesized gene and the SalI cohesive end was added to the strand 5 terminal in order to make easier to insert the synthetic IL2 gene into a vector. The whole gene was divided into 56 kinds of oligonucleotide fragments 12Nt 17Nt as shown in Fig. 7 and 8 in order to synthesize the IL2 gene designed in the abovementioned manner. The method of division was designed so that the complementary strands overlapped by at least 5 bp. The 56 kinds of DNA fragments shown in Fig. 8 were chemically synthesized by using the solid phase triester method. The ligation strategy for constructing the finalIL2 gene from the 56 kinds of chemically synthesized fragments by the T4DNA ligase reaction will be further illustrated in the following processes 1 to 3.Process 1 Synthesis of A to F blocks As shown in Fig. 8, 1 nmol of each one of 46 fragments in which fragments 1 and 56 were excluded from A to F blocks and in which the fragments at the 5 termial of each block 9, 16, 17, 26, 27, 38, 39, 46 were excluded from B block to E block was reacted with 8 Ci units of tY 32p ATP 2800 Ci mmol , 5 units of polynucleotidekinase, 70 mMTris HCl pH 7.5 , and 30 1 of a 10 mM MgCl2 solution at 370C for 30 minutes to label the 5 terminal with 32p.Consequently, 8 nmol of ATP and 5 units of polynucleotidekinase were added, and the resulted solutions were reacted at 370C for 60 minutes and heated at 900C for 5 minutes.Each of the fragments 0.6 nmol which was not phospholylated was mixed with a half amount of the above reaction solutions separately for each of A to F blocks, dialyzed against distilled water at 40C for 16 hours, and then concentrated to dryness. Then, the obtained substances were dissolved in 5 p1 of the ligase buffer solution 40 mMTris HCl pH 7.5, 20 mM MgC12 and then sealed in a 40 p1 capillary. The capillary was put in a 16.5 mm test tubeardf. the test tube was placed in a beaker for heating at 900C for 2 minutes. Then the beaker was allowed to stand at room temperature for 1.7 hours to lower the temperature to 370C, then to stand at 370C for 40 minutes, and finally the temperature was lowered to 200C over a period of 40 minutes.Thereafter, the beaker was allowed to stand at 80C for 60 minutes for annealing the DNA fragments. After the DNA solutions were taken out, 2.0 mM MATP 10 mM DTT and 15 units of T4DNA ligase were added, and reacted at 80C for 5 hours in the resulting solution in a total volume of 38 1. When a portion of the solution was analysed by 14 polyacrylamide electrophoresis containing 7M urea 1 hour after completion of the reaction, a sufficient amount of the intended substance was found to have been produced. The all reaction solution was, in a similar manner, separated by 14 polyacrylamide electrophoresis containing 7M urea. The gel of the intended portion was cut out, homogenized and then extracted with 0.5M ammonium acetate, 0.01M magnesium acetate, 0.1 sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 0.1 mM EDTA at 650C for 16 hours.DNA of A F blocks was then recovered from the solution by ethanol precipitation. Process 2 Synthesis of I and II blocks 200 pmol of B, C, D and E blocks were, in a manner similar to Process 1, reacted with 2.5 units of polyneceotidekinase, 9 VCi units of y 32p ATP 5200 Ci mmol and then with 8 nmol of ATP to phospholylate the 5 terminals in a solution in a total volume of 15 p1. The solution was mixed with 200 pmol of A and F blocks, respectively, and 5 units of 10 mM DTT, T4DNA ligase were then added and reacted at 200C for 5 hours in a total colume of 50 p1. As in the case of Process 1, a portion of the reaction solution was analysed by 8 polyacrylamide electrophoresis containing 7M urea, the intended substance was found to be produced in a good yield.Therefore, the total volume of the solution was separated by 8 polyacrylamide electrophoresis to obtain blocks I and II.Process 3 Blocks I and II each 100 pmol were dissolved in 45 l of a solution of 0.4 mM ATP, 10 mM DTT, 20 mM TrAs HCl pH 7.5, and 10 mM MgC12, 5 units of T4DNA ligase were added and the resulting solution was then reacted dt 370C for 1.5 hours in a solution in a total volume of 50 pl. A portion of the solution was analysed by 8 polyacrylamide electrophoresis containing 7M urea, and the intended substance was found to have been produced. Therefore, the total volume of the solution was separated by 5 polyacrylamide electrophoresis containing 7M urea. In a similar manner, the intended substance was eluted from the gel, desalted, and then reacted with 8 nmol ATP and 5 units of polynucleotidekinase at 370C for 60 minutes in a total colume of 10 l to obtain IL2 DNA for transformation.The IL2 DNA sequence is shown in Fig. 6 and is called SUN IL2. 6 Expression of chemically synthesized IL2 gene in Escherichia coli Fig. 9 Two Vg of the plasmid vector pS20 containing the bL promoter, the SD region of a gene for ACII protein and y IFv gene described in Japanese Patent Public DisclosureNo. 116605 1984 and Escherichia coli transformed by this vector N4830 pS20 was called SBM271 and deposited with Fermentation Research Institute International Deposition Acceptance No. FERM BP 535 was completely cleaved by using 10 units of EcoRI and SalI to obtain a DNA fragment of about 4.2 Kb excluding the YIFN genes by the method described in Item 1.The DNA fragment and 0.1 g of the chemically synthetic IL2 gene were d olved in 20V1 of a ligation reaction solution described be re and subjected to a reaction by using 2 units of T4DNA igase at 150C for 18 hours. The reaction solution 10p1 was used to transformEscherichia coli N4830 described in Japanese Patent PublicDisclosure No. 116605 1984 by the method described before.The obtained ampicillin resistant clone was analyzed by the conventional method. The results showed that a clone containing pS120 which was the plasmid with the IL2 gene inserted in the place of y IFN gene of pS20 had been produced Fig. 9 . The productivity of substances having IL2 activity was measrued in respect to 10 of the obtained clones. The method of IL2 activity measurement will be explained later. An induction was carried out by raising the temperature of the culture solution to 420C after cultivation in the LB medium described before to OD660 0.5 at 320C. After induced at 420C for 45 minutes 1 ml of the culture solution was centrifuged 10,000 rpm, for 5 minutes to recover the cells.The cells were suspended in 1 ml ofPBS solution containing 1 mg ml of lysozyme obtained fromNissui Seiyaku Co., Ltd. and allowed to stand at 40C for 30 minutes. The cells were disrupted by repeating a freeze thaw process 3 times with an ethanol dry ice bath and a 300C water bath. The IL2 activity of the supernatant centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 minutes was investigated by measuring the uptake of h thymidine of the IL2 dfopkfing cells as described later, using human HL 30221 . All of the 10 clones containing pS120 showed the IL2 activity. A solution extracted from the cells of the same clones which had not been exposed to a temperature of 420C showed no IL2 activity.The results using one clone of cells are shown in Table 3.For the purposes of comparison, the results obtained using host cells and no induced cells are also shown as controls in Table 3. Subsequently, an analysis by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis SDS PAGE was carried out. N4830 pS120 was cultured at 320C in M9AA which was prepared by adding 19 amino acids excluding methionine to M9 minimal medium for a time sufficient to reach OD660 6 0.4, and then the temperature was raised to 42 C. After 15 minutes or 30 minutes, 10 Ci of 35S methionine per 0.3 ml culture solution was added and allowed to stand for 2 minutes to complete labelling and then TCA was added to the solution so as to become a final concentration to 10 followed by allowing the solution to stand on ice for 10 minutes. The precipitates were recovered by centrifuging at 10,000 rpm for 5 minutes.The precipirates were isolated by SDS 15 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis SDS PAGE according to the conventional method and the expressed protein was detected by subjecting the gel to radio autography. As a result, a band of about 16 Kb which appeared by the induction at 420C wes nKxeniaMi It was found from these results that IL2 gene obtained by chemical synthesis expressed IL2 protein. 7 Introduction of IL2 gene into yeast secretory vector Fig. 10 A initiation codon is added to the IL2 gene constructed in Item 5 in order to make direct expression possible. In addition, the IL2 gene cannot be directly jointed to the MFa gene because the joining site is an EooRI cutting site. Therefore, an IL2 expression vector pYIL241 utilizing the MFa gene system was constructed by the method described below. The plasmid pS120 10 g was digested by using 40 units of EcoRI and then DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. The DNA was dissolved in 100 pl of a S1 nuclease buffer solution 28 mM NaCl, 50 mM sodium acetate, 4.5 mM ZnSO4, pH 4.6 and reacted with 2 units of S1 nuclease produced by PL at 300C for 15 minutes.After completion of the reaction, an extraction was carried out with phenol once and the DNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. By the complete digestion using 60 units of SalI,theDNA fragment containing IL2 gene of about 0.4 Kb was obtain ed by the method described above. On the other hand, 3 pg of pBR322 was cleaved using 15 units of BamHI, filled in the cohesive ends by using T4DNA polymelase and 4dNTP, and then digested by using 15 units of SalI to obtain theDNA fragment of 4.1 Kb by the method previously described. Both of the fragments were mixed, dissolved in 20 pl of a ligation reaction solution, and reacted using 5 units ofT4DNA ligase at 150C for 18 hours. Escherichia coli JA221 was transformed by using 10 pl of the reaction solution.The obtained ampicillin resisting clone was analyzed according to the general method, and it was found that the clone containing plasmid pIL2 NcoI had been obtained. The plasmid pIL2 NcoI 10 pg was then completely digested with 40 units of NcoI and then subjected to a SI nuclease reaction to remove the cohesive ends by the method previously described.By the complete digestion using 60 units of SalI, the DNA fragment containing IL2 gene of about 0.4 Kb was obtained by the method previously described. Separately, pYMF88 5 Ug was digested using 20 units of HindIII, and after filling in the cohesive ends by usign T4DNA polymelase and 4dNTP, completely digested with 20 units of EcoRI to obtain a DNA fragment of about 1.3 Kb containing the MFa promoter in accordance with the method previously described. On the other hand, 5 pg of pYE2411 was completely digested using 20 units of EcoRI and 30 units of SalI to obtain thereafter the DNA fragment of about 7.1 Kb not containing the MFa gene.The obtained 3 kinds of DNA fragments were mixed and reacted in the presence of 5 units of T4DNA ligase at 150C for 18 hours. Escherichia coli JA221 was transformed by using 10 p1 of the reaction solution. The analysis of the obtained ampicillin resitant clone by the conventional method showed that a clone which is believed to contain pYIL241 had been obtained. 8 Secretor expression in yeast Six clones which seemed to contain pYIL241 were selected from those obtianed in Item 7, and the plasmid DNA was separated and purified in accordance with the conventional method. They were used to transform a mating type of haploid Saccharomyces cereviaiae XS16 lB by the method previously described. The obtained TRP transformant was cultured with shaking in the CA medium described above at 300C. After culturing for 16 hours, IL2 activity was measured with respect to the culture supernatant which was obtained by centrifugating at 10,000 rpm for 5 minutes Table 4, using human HL 30221 . As a result, the activity was confirmed in the culture supernatant of the transformant obtained by using the plasmid pYIL241 DNA separated from 3 clones out of 6 clones.After concentration of the culture supernatant by using Centricon lO produced by Amicon Co.,Ltd. , the sample was subjected to SDS PAGE. The results are shown in Fig. 11. A band originated from pYIL241, which does not appear with respect to the host, was found at the position corresponding to about 16 Kb. It is concluded from this result that the IL2 protein was secretively produced in an amount of about 0.2 pg in terms of 1 ml of the culture supernatant. Then, the change of the IL2 se etcr expression with time passage wasinvestigated. The yeast transformed with pYE2411 was used for a parallel running as control.The cultivation was carried out according to the method previously described in Item 4 and IL2 activity was measured with respect to the culture supnatanttained by centrifugating at 10,000 rpm for 5 minutes. The results are shown in Fig. 12. The secretor expression of IL2 was recognized in parallel with proliferation of the transformant.That is to say, the increase in IL2 activity in the medium was recognized in the growth phase over 12 horus, as seen in Fig. 12. Furthermore, no IL2 expression was recognized with respect to the a mating type of haploid yeast transformed with pYIL241 and, therefore, this indicates that the secretor expression depends on the M promoter. 9 Measurement of IL2 activity The IL2 activity was measured in terms of the amount of uptake of tritium thymidine with respect to mouse CTIL 2 Baker, et al., J. Exp. Med., 149, 273 1979 and humanHL 30221 distributed by Prof. Omaeda of Kyoto University which are IL2 dependent cell lines. The cultures supernatant called crude IL2 below of the yeast in the CA medium was diluted with RPMI 1640 medium containing 2.5 fetal bovine serum and 5 x 10 M 2 mercaptoethanol in the case ofCTIL 2, or containing 20 fetal bovine serum in the case ofHL 30221 cell to form a 4 time dilution series on a microtiter plate of 96 wells. 2 x 104 cells were added to each of the wells to produce a final liquid volume of 200 1. After a 20 hour CTIL 2 cell or 44 hour HL 30221 cell culture in a CO2 incubator 5 CO2, at 370C , 0.25 PCi 8 Ci mmole of tritium thymidine was added to each of the wells and allowed to culture for further 4 hours, and then the cells were collected on a glass fiber filter, and washed thoroughly with water. Then, the amounts of tritium taken up in the DNA were measured by a liquid scintillation counter Packed TRI CARB 460C . Fig. 13 shows the increase in uptake of tritium which depends upon the concentration of crude IL2. IL2 activity showing 50 of the maximum amount of uptake was regarded as 1 unit. 10 Effect of crude IL2 on CTIL 2 cell proliferation The CTIL 2 cells were subcultured in APMI 1640medium containing 10 fetal bovine serum and 5 x 10 5M 2 mercapto ethanol containing 10 v v crude IL2 Fig. 14 . TheCTIL 2 cells in the medium containing the crude IL2 proliferated by about 4 times every day, but the proliferation did not take place in the medium free from the crude IL2r causing almost all cells to die 2 days from removal of IL2.Furthermore, no IL2 activity was recognized for the culture supernatant from the cultivation for 3 days. 11 Biochemical property of yeast IL2 1 Fractionation of crude IL2 by chromatofocusing Fig. 15 The crude IL2 100 ml was concentrated by Centricon10 Amico Co., Ltd. to 10 ml, dialyzed against 0.025 M tris HCl buffer solution pH 8.0 and then fractionated by using a poly buffer and an ion exchange resin PBE94 column Pharmacia Co., Ltd. 1.5 x 15 cm which had beenequilibrated with the same buffer. IL2 was eluted with 250 ml of the 10 fold diluted poly buffer Pharmacia Co., Ltd. polybuffer 74 96 7 3, final pH 5.0 , and the IL2 activity was eluted as a single peak near pH 6.7, as shown in Fig. 15. 2 Fractionation of crude IL2 by Con A Sepharose Fig. 16 The crude IL2 10 ml was fractionated by a Con ASepharose 6B Pharmacia Co., Ltd. 1.5 x 7 cm equilibrated with 20 mM Tris HC1 buffer solution pH 7.4 Fig. 16 . The IL2 activity was recovered in both theunadsorbed fraction and the fraction adsorbed and eluted with 0.1 M a methyl mannoside produced by Nakarai Kagaku Co., Ltd. , and proportion of the activity between the fractions was estimated to be 4 1 on the basis of the standard reaction curve. The results indicate that IL2 which had bonding sites in common with a methyl mannoside to concanavalin A was contained in the crude IL2 fractions in an amount of about 20 of the total IL2 activity. Mier and Gallo J. Immuno, 128, 1122 1982 andWelte, et al. J. Exp. Med., 156, 454 1982 have reported that IL2 produced by stimulating lymphocyte with phytohemagglutinin did not bond to Con A Sepharose. Thereafter, it can be concluded that the Con A Sepharose adsorbed fraction recognized here was of characteristics inherent to the IL2 produced by the present production system. 3 Fractionation of crude IL2 by ion exchange column The crude IL2 200 ml was dialyzed against 20 mMTris HCl buffer solution pH 7.4 and subjected to a DEAEToyo pearl column Toyo Soda, 1.5 x 15 cm which had been equilibrated with the same buffer, and the adsorbed fraction was fractionated by increasing the salt strength with NaCl Fig. 17 . The IL2 activity was eluted as a broad peak having two maximums. In the case of fractionation byCM Toyopearl under the same conditions, IL2 was fractionated into unadsorbed and adsorbed fractions. 4 Fractionation by hydrophobic chromatography Ammonium sulfate was added to the DEAE Toyopearleluted fraction so as to produce 20 saturation and this was subjected to a buthyl Toyopearl column Toyo Soda, 1.5 x 15 cm and fractionated by decreasing the salt strength. The IL2 activity showed a curve having two peaks, as shown in Fig. 18. It was concluded that this result was caused by the heterogeneous properties of IL2 due to the presence of saccharide chains structure, etc. 12 Secretor expression by immobilized yeast Each of the transformed yeast XS16 lB pYaNE412 and XS16 1B pYIL241 obtained in Items 4 and 8 wawas proliferated in the CA medium until reaching abcxe 107 cells per 1 ml, mixed with 4 carrageanane solution supported at 37 C 30 C so as to becone 5 x 107 cells per 1 ml, and then immediately added dropwise to a 0.3 N KC1 solution to entrap and immobilize the yeast onto the carrageenane.The immobilized yeast was added to the minimal medium containing 2 Casamino acid and cultured with shaking at 300C for 24 hours. The immobilized yeast was transferred into a fresh portion of the same medium and this point was regarded as 0 hour for the purposes of investigating the change with passage of time. The culture was carried out with shaking at 300C, no medium being added during the culturing. The results are shown in Fig. 19. The production of IL2 reached a stationary stage after 6 hours, but in the case of ci NE, it decreased after 2 hours. From this result, it is concluded that although the secretor expression of aNE lasted in the same way as IL2 over 6 hours, the decomposition rate in the medium took place faster than the expression. The IL2 production was possible by a continuous culture in which a fresh medium was replaced every 6 hours, and the IL2 secreted was stable in the medium. On the other hand, peptide of a small molecular weight such as aNE is unstable in the medium, but continous culture is thought to be possible, for example, by adding a decomposition inhibitor.
