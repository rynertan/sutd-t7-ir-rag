# TEMPERATURE CONTROL SYSTEM

## Abstract
The difference temperature TD between an actual temperature TA and a setpoint temperature TSP passes through PID proportional, integral, and differential circuitry 17 to give a target temperature TT. An error temperature TE is the difference between TT and a delivered water temperature TDW, and drives a flip flop FF1 via a hysteresis circuit 21. FF1 produces a control signal for turning on a heat source HS, from which hot water is pumped to a radiator R. The heat source HS may be a heat pump, which draws a transient high inrush cur rent when turned on. To minimize the inrush currents, a timer TMR1 is triggered by the control signal and prevents by logic 22 24 the generation of a further control signal until the timer period has expired. The system may be implemented by a microprocessor.
