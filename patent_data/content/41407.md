## Description
IMPROVEMENTS RELATING TO METAL SHEATHED ELASTOMERIC CABLES This invention concerns improvements relating to metal sheathed elastomeric cables. Such cables, wherein the electrical insulation of the cable core comprises an elastomeric layer commonly extruded directly onto the cable cores are increasingly taking precedence over prior cables wherein the insulation of the cable is comprised by a built up and commonly oil impregnated layer of paper tape or the like. Difficulties have been encountered in the exploitation of such cable manufacturing techniques on account of the susceptibility of the prime elastomeric insulating materials1 such as cross linked polyethylene for example, to develop defects known as water trees when subjected to alternating current electrical stress in the presence even of only very small amounts of water. The presence of water trees in elastomeric insulating materials has been found to have a significant deteriorating influence on important electrical characteristics of the materials, particularly as the level of electrical stress applied to the materials is increased. Accordingly, it is desirable to minimise the risk of water tree development. The conventional method of manufacturing elastomeric cables was to extrude the elastomeric material directly onto the cable core as it was passed continuously through the head of an extrusion machine and then to pass the coated cable through a curing stage, advantageously arranged as a catenary tube, wherein the coated cable was subjected to superheated steam for completing the crosslinking process. For very high voltage cables, the cure of synthetic dielectrics, such as cross linked polyethylene, using high pressure steam is being abandoned because of the associated production within the dielectric of moisture filled microvoids which may form nuclei for water treeing.Dry cure methods are instead being adopted wherein exposure of the elastomeric cable insulation to water is avoided and alternative dry curing media such as inert gases, silicone oils, eutectic salt mixtures, high energy irradiations etc. are employed. Such measures achieve a degree of success in reducing the extent of water treeing associated with the cable manufacturing process, but the problem nevertheless remains of water tree development during service use of the cable. The provision of a metal sheath on the cable reduces the risk of moisture invading the cable in use, but, should the metal sheath be ruptured, a significant risk arises of water tree development with consequent deterioration of the cable. Proposals have been made for the longitudinal sealing of an elastomeric cable against the ingress of water by provision of a sealing material between the insulating elastomer and the metal cable sheath. In British Patent Specification No. 1 563 685 a proposal is made for use of a sealing material comprising cellulose powder. The present invention provides an improved sealing material. for introduction a between the insulated cable core and the protective metal sheath of a metal sheathed elastomeric cable and or b between the cable, core and its elastomeric insulation layer and, in the case where the cable core is composed of a plurality of conductor strands, within the interstices between the individual strands. The invention also extends to an improved cable incorporating such a sealant. According to the invention such a sealing compound comprises a mastic material formed of colloidal clay preferably bentonite dispersed within a non migratory liquid vehicle preferably a PVC plasticiser and loaded with a semi conducting material preferably carbon such as to render the mastic electrically semi conducting a mastic material thus formulated i s believed to be suitable for incorporation into an elastomeric cable as an effective sealant against water penetration. A preferred cable construction in accordance with the invention comprises a conductor sealed with such a filling compound, crosslinked polyethylene insulated and with conductor and insulation screens, filling compound and aluminium sheath, the latter being corrugated for enhanced cable flexibility. As will be discussed in the following, such a filling compound has advantageous characteristics as regards mobility, water sensitivity, electrical properties and non migratory tendencies which appear to render it extremely suitable for incorporation into an elastomeric cable. As regards mobility, the compound should be capable of movement, particularly between the cable insulation and the metal sheath, to accommodate dimensional changes as the sheathed cable expands and contracts during thermal cycling, and yet should be sufficiently form stable, at least initially, as to allow ready application to and between the individual cable conductors during stranding of a multi conductor core and or to the insulated cable in the correctly metered quantity immediately prior to application of the metal cable. sheath. By adjustment of the liquid vehicle to solids content ratio of the mastic, the mobility requirements can readily be achieve d with a resultant material which can be pumped without difficulty. The sealing compound should be water sensitive in that, when in the cable, adventitious ingress of water, caused for example by damage to the metal cable sheath, will bring about a swelling of the material sufficient to seal off the core and or the sheath space at the water entry location. The use of a suitable colloidal clay such as bentonite as the principal solids content of the mastic is advantageous in this regard in that bentonite swells when contacted with water and can form an effective barrier against further moisture penetration along the core and or along the space tbetweenthe insulated core and the sheath. In order to ensure electrical contact between the metal cable sheath and the conductor insulation wherever the two may touch, the filling compound must be semiconducting with satisfactory semi conductivity over the working temperature range of the cable. Thins requirement can be achieved by inclusion of appropriate amounts of conducting carbon black or conducting carbon black graphite mixtures in the correct proportion.If the cable is correctly filled with the sealing compound according to the invention, then continuous longitudinal contact of the semi conducting filler with the metal sheath will result with the advantage that the fault current carrying characteristics of the cable will be much improved as compared with the untilled situation where only occasional and haphazard contact between the core insulation and the metal screen would occur. Finally, it is desirable that no component of the w filling material should develop migratory tendencies.Physical changes to the cable core can not be tolerated5 and even small scale absorption into semi conducting screens within the cable may produce an unacceptable rise in screen resistivity. Migration ofthe liquid component of the mastic is prevented by use of non migratory liquids such as non migratory PVC plasticisers. The following lists the formulation of a currently preferred mastic Parts by weightBentonite Fulbent WT 208 PJ 35.0Modified Polypropylene Adipate 17.5Pentalrythritol type plasticiser 26.5Carbon black Vulcan P 17.5Graphite powder 3.5 The above ingredients mix easily to form the required mastic which, on testing, has been found to demonstrate advantageous properties as described hereinbefore. In use of such a mastic, a variable rate force feed pump may be employed to introduce the mastic between the wire component layers of a stranded conductor and or onto the cable core in precisely metered quantities immediately prior to the application to the cable of its metal sheath. There has thus been described an improved sealing material for incorporation into elastomeric cables as a barrier to ingress of moisture and consequent development of water trees and deterioration of the electrical characteristics of the cable. Whilst the invention has been described herein with particular. reference to specific materials, it is to be appreciated that various aiterations and modifications could possibly be made without significant departure from the advantageous features obtained and that the specific materials hereinbefore identified are therefore to be regarded as exemplifying and not limiting the invention.
