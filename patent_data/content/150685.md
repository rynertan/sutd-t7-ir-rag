# METHOD AND MACHINE FOR INSULATING ELECTRIC CONDUCTORS FOR TRANSFORMERS BY GLUEING INSULATION COATING SHEET AND CONDUCTORS THUS INSULATED

## Abstract
Method and machine for producing electric strap con ductors for carrying out transformers in general, by glueing to the conductor an insulating tape in longitudinal direction instead of helical direction. The conductor thus obtained has improved characteristics and can be produced at lower cost.
