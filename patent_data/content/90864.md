# MAGNETIC RECORDING MEDIUM.

## Abstract
A magnetic recording medium containing as a binder a modified poiymer prepared by graft polymerizing a polymer azible unsaturated compound having a sulfonic acid group or sulfonic acid metal salt group onto a polymer by irradiating with radiation. This modified polymer shows good adhesion to magnetic powder and improves dispersi bilily and filling properties of magnetic powder because of the presence of sulfonic acid group or sulfonic acid metal salt group. Thus, the magnetic recording medium shows excel lent durability. Further, since the modified polymer can be obtained by graft polymerization utilizing radiation, the polymer to be modified can be selected from such a wide range that the magnetic recording medium can be obtained by an industrially practical process.
