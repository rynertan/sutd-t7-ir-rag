# VEHICLE REARVIEW MIRROR ASSEMBLY CONTAINING A FLUID LIGHT CONTROLLING MEDIUM

## Abstract
A casing 61 has a transparent window plate 7 sealed therein. A reflector plate 12 is mounted on a diaphram 66 which forms a sealed chamber 72 with the base 64 of the casing. The casing 61 is mounted on a conventional mirror adjustment mechanism 80 . A plurality of concial compression springs 73 urge the reflector plate 12 against the inside surface of the window plate 7 in the day position of the reflector plate 12 . To move the reflector plate 12 for a day position to a night position, a pump 84 draws an optically dense light attenuating fluid from a reservoir 82 and pumps it into an annular chamber 78 and between the window plate 7 and reflector plate 12 , to move the reflector plate 12 rearwards so that the fluid forms a masking layer between the reflector plate 12 and window plate 7 . The masking layer extinguishes reflections from the reflector plate 12 in the night position. A solenoid valve 79 prevents return of the fluid to the reservoir 82 in the night position.

## Description
This invention relates to a vehicle rearview mirror assembly of the type containing a fluid light controlling medium. More particularly, the invention relates to a vehicle rearview mirror of the day night type, which utilizes an optically dense light attenuating fluid in the night position of the mirror, for preventing glare which is dangerous when driving at night and also to avoid multiple images. Vehicle rearview mirrors of the above referred type are known and are described, for example, in U.S. Patent Specification Nos. 3,198,070, and 3,233,515. The above Specifications describe the rearward movement of a reflector or mirror, so that an optically dense light attenuating fluid is displaced from an adjacent reservoir, to the interface of a glass window and the mirror. Thus, a very thin film of the light attenuating fluid sandwiched at the interface for normal daylight conditions day mode is increased in thickness until adequate light attenuating properties are achieved for the night mode of the mirror. A problem with the vehicle rearview mirrors described in the above Specifications is that when the force is applied to the rear of the reflector to move the reflector rearwards, the reflector tends to form a shallow suction cup in which the periphery of the reflector acts to form a seal against the rear face of the window plate and thereby restrict the passage of fluid between the window plate and reflector plate. Also, in view of the suction cup effect, rearward movement of the reflector causes the pressure of the fluid behind the reflector to tend to increase and the pressure in front of the reflector to tend to decrease, and this has the effect of acting to prevent further rearward movement of the reflector and thus separation of the reflector plate and window plate. A further problem with the vehicle rearview mirrors described in the above Specifications, is that they are complicated in construction, involving a multiplicity of parts which are difficult to assemble. Thus, it is an object of the present invention to provide a vehicle rearview mirror of the day night type, which utilises an optically dense light attenuating fluid in the night position, and which is relatively simple in construction and which mitigates the above mentioned problems. A particular object of the invention is to provide a rear view mirror in which the movement of the reflector from the day to the night mode is faster and more efficient than in the prior art. According to the invention there is provided a vehicle rearview mirror assembly comprising, In one embodiment of the invention the fluid control means comprises, an electrically operated pump to pump the fluid from a reservoir of said fluid and inject it between the window plate and the reflector plate and maintaining the fluid under pressure between the window plate and the reflector plate. Preferably, spring means is provided to urge the reflector plate from the second night position to the first day position when the pressure of fluid between the window plate and the reflector plate is released, the spring means in use acting to expel substantially all of the fluid from between the window plate and the reflector plate. Further preferably, the reflector plate is mounted on a diaphram which forms a wall of a sealed fluid chamber, the fluid chamber forming a partial reservoir for the optically dense light attenuating fluid, and in use, the fluid is drawn out of the chamber causing a suction force in the chamber acting to separate the reflector plate and the window plate. The spring means preferably comprises a plurality of conical compression springs arranged in the fluid chamber to urge the reflector plate and the window plate together. Preferably, the fluid is an optically dense light attenuating liquid, stable throughout the temperature range which the invention may be subject to, for example, 40 c to 120 c and having a viscosity compatible with free movement within the casing. The casing is preferably located within a mirror housing which is open at the end adjacent the window plate and which forms a seal with the casing or the periphery of the outer face of the window plate. The window plate is preferably a transparent glass plate. The reflecting plate is preferably a conventional glass mirror. Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Referring now to the accompanying drawings wherein similar numerals have been used to indicate like parts, and referring in particular to Figures 1 to 3 there is shown therein, a first embodiment of a vehicle rearview mirror assembly according to the invention, which assembly is generally indicated at 1. There is provided a rectangular casing 2 formed of any suitable rubber or plastics material. The casing 2 includes a continuous sidewall 3, having a forward edge portion 4 and a flat rearwall 5 disposed rearwardly from the forward edge portion 4. The forward edge portion 4 has a continuous U shaped annular recess 6, in which is located a transparent glass or plastics window plate 7 being of low light reflectivity. The outer face 8 of the window plate 7 will reflect approximately four percent 4 of light incident on that face. The glass or perspex window plate 7 forms a fluid seal with the U shaped annular recess 6 of the casing 2. The casing 2 has an interior peripheral recess 9 defined between the margin 10 of the rearwall 5 and the continuous sidewall 3. The periphery 11 of the casing 2 in the region of the peripheral recess 9, is readily flexible permitting the rearwall 5 to be easily moved relative to the continuous sidewall 3. A reflector or mirror plate 12 is mounted in any suitable manner on the interior surface 13 of the rearwall 5. The interior surface 13 of the rearwall 5 of the casing 2 includes a plurality of channels 14, only one shown which communicate with the interior peripheral recess 9. The channels 14, communicate with an aperture 15 in the rearwall 5, the aperture 15 communicating with a reservoir of a suitable optically dense light attenuating liquid 16. The reservoir comprises a bellows unit 17 mounted centrally on the exterior face 18 of the rearwall 5 of the casing 2. The bellows unit 17 can expand to its full extent in conventional manner as shown in Figure 1. Further, the bellows unit 17 is liquid sealed to the exterior face 18 of the rearwall 5 of the casing 2 by means of a circular lug 19. Thus, the optically dense light attenuating liquid 16 is primarily contained within the bellows unit 17. The bellows unit 17 includes a conventional first shape memory metal coil 20, one end of which is fixed to a bracket 21 secured to the free end 22 of the bellows unit 17. The other end of the shape memory coil 20 is secured to a bracket 23 mounted adjacent the aperture 15 in the rearwall 5 of the casing 2. Also, the bellows unit 17 incorporates a spring urged latch 24, which co operates with a latch member 25 fixed to the free end 22 of the bellows unit 17. The latch 24 is pivotally mounted on a support 26 fixed to the rearwall 5 of the casing 2. One end 27 of the latch 24 is connected by a spring 28 to a support 29 secured in the rearwall 5 of the casing 2. The end 27 of the latch 24 is also connected by a second conventional shape memory metal coil 30 to the latch member 25. The casing 2 and bellows unit 17 are located within a mirror housing 31 which is open at the front end 32 adjacent the window plate 7. The housing 31 compresses the forward edge portion 4 of the casing 2 in the region of the U shaped recess 6, so that the casing 2 forms a seal with the window plate 7. The vehicle rearview mirror assembly 1, in use, is mounted in any suitable manner on or in a vehicle not shown . Each of the shape memory metal coils, 20, 30 is connected in any suitable manner to a power supply not shown mounted within the vehicle. Referring now in particular to Figure 1, the reflector plate 12 is shown in a first day position in juxta position with and abutting the inside face of the window plate 7. This first day position of the reflector plate 12, provides a relatively high degree of light reflectivity, since at most there is an extremely thin film of the optically dense light attenuating liquid 16, between the reflector plate 12 and the window plate 7, resulting in a high degree of light reflectivity as if the window plate 7 were not present. In order to move the reflector plate 12 from the first day position shown in Figure 1 to the second night position shown in Figure 2, the shape memory metal coil 20 is heated above its transition temperature by passing an electrical current throught it from the power supply not shown , which causes the coil 20 to contract, thus compressing the bellows unit 17 to the position shown in Figure 2. The electrical current from the power supply not shown may be switched on either manually or automatically. For example, during travel at night the electrical current may be switched on automatically by a signal supplied from photoelectric sensors mounted in or on the vehicle when the sensors detect a predetermined level of light intensity from the headlights of a following vehicle. Alternatively, the electrical current may be switched on by the driver of the vehicle manually operating a switch which may be conveniently positioned, for example, on the dashboard or steering wheel of the vehicle. The bellows unit 17 is maintained in the second night position of Figure 2 by the latch member 25 engaging with the spring urged latch 24 as shown. As the bellows unit 17 compresses from the position of Figure 1 to that of Figure 2, the optically dense light attenuating liquid 16 is forced out of the bellows unit 17, through the aperture 15 in the rearwall 5, and through the channels 14 to the peripheral recess 9 of the casing 2, and is forced between the window plate 7 and the reflector plate 12 thus pushing the reflector plate 12 rearwards to a second night position within the casing 2 spaced from the window plate 7. In this second night position, the window plate 7 provides a small amount of light reflectivity, and the optically dense light attenuating liquid 16, forms a masking layer 35 between the window plate 7 and the mirror 12, substantially extinguishing light reflections by the reflector plate 12. The amount of reflectivity of the rearview mirror assembly 1, in this second night position, is now reduced to approximately four percent 4 since the major reflection now comes from the glass window plate 7. In order to return the reflector plate 12 from the second night position to the first day position, the second shape memory metal coil 30 is energized in conventional manner either manually or automatically, which causes it to contract thus pivotting the latch 24 to release the latch member 25, thus enabling the bellows unit 17 to expand to its full extent again. As the bellows unit 17 expands, it creates a suction effect which causes the optically dense light attenuating fluid 16 forming the masking layer 35, to be drawn back through the recess 9, channels 14, and aperture 15 into the bellows unit 17, and also causes the mirror 12 to return to the position shown in Figure 1. In practice, however, in the first day position of the reflector plate 12, the fluid 16 is contained mostly within the bellows unit 17, although a volume of the fluid will also be contained in the recess 9 and the channels 14. It will be apparent that the forces in the shape memory metal coils 20, 30 the latch spring 28, and the bellows unit 17, must be suitably arranged to enable smooth operation of the rearview mirror assembly 1. It will be understood from the foregoing description that as the rearwall 5 moves from the first position to the second position and Referring now to Figures 4, 5 and 6 there is shown a second embodiment of the invention wherein similar numerals have been used to indicate like parts in the previous embodiment of the invention. The rearview mirror assembly 1, is formed having an inner rearwall 5 integral with an outer rearwall 40. The inner rearwall 5 defines a plurality of channels 14 Figure 6 which are in liquid communication with the interior peripheral recess 9 defined between the margin 10 of the rearwall 5 and the continuous sidewall 3. Defined between the inner and outer rearwalls 5, 40 respectively is a chamber 41, which is in liquid communication with the channels 14. The inner and outer rearwalls 5, 40 respectively are joined by integrally formed wall portions 35 in the regions 36 between adjacent pairs of channels 14. A flexible reservoir 42 for the optically dense light attenuating fluid 16 is mounted on the outer rearwall 40, of the casing and is connected The reflector plate 12 as shown in Figure 5 is in its first day position in juxta position with and abutting the inside face of the window plate 7. To move the reflector plate 12 from the first day position shown in Figure 5 to the second night position, the electric pump 45 and solenoid 51 are simultaneously switched on by the driver of the vehicle. This causes the actuator arm 52 to be moved to the left in Figure 4, to the position shown in dotted outline, which squeezes the conduit 49 as shown in dotted outline against the stopper member 53 and closes off conduit 49, thus preventing any fluid 16 from being pumped out of the chamber 41. With the pump 45 switched on the optically dense light attenuating fluid 16 is pumped from the reservoir 42 through conduits 43 and 47 In order to return the reflector plate 12 from the second night position to the first day position, it is only necessary for the driver of the vehicle to operate a switch and activate circuitry to de energise the solenoid 51, thus causing the actuator member 52 to return to its inital position in which the conduit 49 is open. With the conduit 49 now open, the fluid pressure is released and the fluid flows back from the chamber 41 through the conduit 49 to the reservoir 42. The periphery 11 of the casing 2 in this embodiment of the invention, is sufficiently resilient and in effect acts as a spring member to force the reflector plate 12 back to its first day position and expel the fluid 16 from between the reflector plate 12 and the window plate 7. Any other suitable form of a resilient means, for example, spring s or a resilient diaphram, or suction means may be provided to force the reflector plate 12 when required, from its second night position, to its first day position, and expel the fluid 16 from between the reflector plate 12 and the window plate 7. Examples of alternative arrangements will be described in the following embodiments of the invention. Referring now to Figures 7 and 8 there is shown therein a third embodiment of the invention generally indicated at 60. In this construction, there is provided a substantially dish shaped casing 61 having a continuous rigid sidewall 62 formed integrally with a ridig base 64. A substantially dish shaped mirror support member 65 is mounted within the casing 61 and has a diaphram portion 66 on which is fixed in suitable manner a conventional reflector plate or mirror 12. The mirror support member 65 also has a continuous sidewall 68 which has a forward edge portion 69 having a continuous U shaped annular recess 70 in which is located the transparent glass or plastics window 7. The window plate 7 forms a fluid seal with the forward edge portion 69 of the sidewall 68. The sidewall 62 of the casing 61 is enclosed within and bonded to a peripheral housing 71. The forward edge portion 69 of the side wall 68 is sandwiched between the housing 71 and the end 67 of the sidewall 62 so that the forward edge portion effectively forms a fluid seal with the periphery of the window plate 7. A sealed fluid chamber 72 is defined between the base 64 and the diaphram 66. A plurality of conical compression springs 73 are located within the chamber 72, the springs 73 being seated in respective recesses 74 in the base 64. The springs 73 serve to bias the diaphram 66 and thus the reflector plate 12 to a first day position, as shown, with the reflector plate 12 confronting the inner surface of the window plate 7. The member 65 has formed therein an inlet conduit 75 which projects through an aperture 76 in the base 64. Further, the conduit 75 is integral with the flange portion 77 of the diaphram 66, the flange 77 defining a localised mouth or enclosure 59 which communicates with an annular chamber 78 which surrounds the chamber 72, the chamber 78 being in fluid communication with the inlet conduit 75 A reservoir 82 of optically dense light attenuating fluid 16 is mounted within the housing 81. The reservoir 82 has an outlet conduit 83 connected to an electrically operated pump 84. The outlet from the pump 84 is connected to the conduit 75 on the diaphram 66 The reflector or mirror 12 is shown in Figure 7 in its first day position with the reflector plate 12 in juxta position with and abutting the inside face of the window plate 7. The reflector plate 12 is maintained in this position by the conical springs 73. In order to move the reflector plate 12 from its day position to its night position, the driver of the vehicle activates a switch not shown to switch on the pump 84 and energise the solenoid 90 to close the valve 79. Once the solenoid 90 is energised, the arm 91 is pulled into the solenoid 90 so that the rod 93 compresses the conduit portion 88 against the bracket 89 effectively closing off the conduit 87. The pump 84 draws light attenuating fluid 16 from the reservoir 82 through the conduit 83 and pumps it along the conduit 85, In Figures 9 and 10 there is shown a fourth embodiment of the invention which is similar to the previous embodiment and thus only the differences will be described. The main freature of this construction is that the optically dense light attenuating fluid 16 is contained within the chamber 72 which is a main reservoir as well as within a partial reservoir which in this case is an expandable container 100. The container 100 has an outlet 101 which is connected by means of a T piece conduit 102 to both the inlet conduit 83 to the pump 84 and to an outlet conduit 103 connected to the sealed fluid chamber 72. Further, the outlet conduit 87 from the annular chamber 78 provides an inlet 87 to the chamber 72 In Figure 11, there is shown a fifth embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, the casing 61 has an inner base portion 64 and an outer base portion 64 As shown in Figure 11 the mirror 12 is in its first or day position in juxta position with and abutting the inside face of the window plate 7. In order to move the reflector plate 12 from its day position to its night position the pump 84 is switched on to draw fluid 16 from the chamber 72 Although, in the embodiments shown in Figures 6 to 11, the chamber 72 may have any suitable shape, Figure 12 illustrates some preferred shapes which the chamber may take. In particular, in the fourth and fifth embodiments shown in Figures 9 to 11, in which a suction force is created the shape of the chamber 72 is of some importance. In Figure 12 the shapes A, B, C and D have been found to be more suitable than the shape E. In the chamber shapes A and B, up to approximately 50 of the total fluid 16 in the mirror assembly may be contained within the lobe regions A1, and B1 respectively with a minimal amount of the total fluid being contained within the horizontal portions A2,B2 respectively. The horizontal portions should not however be so small as to restrict the fluid flow therein. Thus, when the pump 84 is operated to move the reflector plate 12 from the day to the night position and the fluid is drawn from the chamber 72, the suction effect created within the chamber 72 is greatest in the lobe regions A1,B1, and acts to separate the reflector plate 12 and window plate 7 in this region thus enabling the ready injection of fluid between the window plate 7 and reflector plate 12. In the chamber shapes C and D there is a single lobe region C1,D1 respectively with elongate horizontal portions C2 and D2 respectively. The lobe regions C1 and D1 in each case contain up to approximately 50 of the total fluid 16 in the assembly. In use, as the fluid is drawn from the chamber 72 by the pump 84, the suction effect within the chamber 72 is greatest in the region of the lobes and acts to initially separate the reflector plate 12 and window plate 7 in this region to permit the injection of the fluid 16. In general it is desirable if the suction force created is greatest adjacent to one edge of the reflector plate 12. The chamber 72 may also be of a generally rectangular shape as shown at F. Some further properties of the embodiments of the invention which will in general be applied will now be described. The known desirable optical properties of a fluid controlled day night mirror assembly will be applied to the embodiments of the invention described herein and these properties are described in U.S. Patent Specification No. 3,198,070. The fluid 16 will be matched to the materials which come into contact with the fluid so that loss of fluid by permeation through the materials is eliminated or minimised. Thus, the materials used will have a minimal, if any, permeability to the fluid. It is envisaged that in practice the time period in moving the mirror from the day to the night mode of the mirror assembly will be of the order of a second. Also, in moving the mirror from the night to the day mode, it is envisaged that an increase in reflectance of approximately 50 can be achieved within 1 2 seconds and maximum reflectance of up to 70 90 can be achieved within a few minutes as the fluid 16 is gradually expelled from between the window and reflector plates. It will also be understood that the assembly is suitably constructed that in the event of failure of the components of the mirror assembly, the reflector plate 7 will return to, or remain in the first or day position. If desired, spacers known in the art may be used to determine a minimum spacing between the window and mirror when the assembly is in the day position. Such spacers are described in U.S. Patent Specification No. 3,198,070. It will be understood that any suitable drive mechanism may be employed for forcing the optically dense light attenuating fluid under pressure between the window and reflector plate.
