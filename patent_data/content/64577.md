## Description
CRYSTALLINE ZEOLITIC MATERIAL, SYNTHESIS AND USE THEREOF This invention relates to a new crystalline zeolite material, to a method for synthesising it, andto its use,. inter alia as organic conversion catalyst. Many crystalline zeolites are known, in most cases as aluminosilicates. Some occur at least so far only in nature, for instance paulingite and merlinoite some occur only as a result of synthesis, for instance zeolites A and ZSM 5 and some occur in both natural and synthetic forms, for instance mordenite, a synthetic counterpart of which is known as Zeolon, and faujasite, synthetic counterparts of which are known as zeolites X and Y. Counterparts are of course demonstrated as such by correspondence of their X ray diffraction data, the indicia by means of which the individuality of a zeolite is established.Such data are a manifestation of the particular geometry of the three dimensional lattice, formed of SiO4 and in most cases AlO4 tetrahedra crosslinked by the sharing of oxygen atoms and including sufficient cationic complement to balance the resulting negative charge on any A104 tetrahedra, of which a zeolite may consist. The chemical formula of an aluminosilicate zeolite is thus Mx n AlO2 si 2 y where M is a cation of valence n and x and y are the number of aluminum and silicon atoms, respectively, in the unit cell the geometric unit which repeats throughout the extent of the lattice . This expression is however frequently transmuted into the mole ratio of oxides form, M 2 n0 A120D 2y x SiO2 which is of course empirically ascertainable and thus the only formula which can be ascribed to a zeolite when its unit cell contents are unknown.Since the only significant quantity in such a formula is the term 2y x, and since this term which is almost invariably a range can usually be satisfied by many zeolites of widely differing lattice geometry, chemical formula is not uniquely restrictive in establishing the identity of a zeolite. Furthermore, such a formula frequently expresses artefact when empirically derived, the cationic valence aluminum atoms ratio deviating from unity, and it fails to provide for zeolites whose lattice structure can be brought into existence from reaction mixtures from which alumina is excluded. Moreover, both the unit cell formula and the mole ratio of oxides formula imply that the geometrical identity which persists between succeeding unit cells is accompanied by their compositional identity. We have now discovered a zeolite having a lattice structure previously unknown, as evidenced by itsX ray diffraction data, which we call ZSM 39. According to the present invention a crystalline zeolitic material, ZSM 39, has a lattice constituted by SiD4 and possibly A104 tetrahedra cross linked by the sharing of oxygen atoms and characterized by the following interplanar spacings Interplanar Spacing D A Relative Intensity 11.2 0.2 W 6.8 0.15 M 5.8 0.1 VS 5.6 0.1 VS 4.8 0.1 M 4.4 0.1 M 3.95 0.08 M S 3.7 0.08 VS 3.4 0.07 M S 3.3 0.07 VS 3.2 0.07 W 3.1 0.06 W 3 0 0.06 W 2.3 0.05 W These values were determined by standard techniques. The radiation was the K alpha doublet of copper, and a scintillation counter spectrometer with a strip chart pen recorder was used.The peak heights, I, and the positions as a function of 2 times theta, where theta is the Bragg angle, were read from the spectrometer chart. From these, the relative intensities, 100I Io, where Io is the intensity of the strongest line or peak, and d obs. , the interplanar spacing in A, corresponding to the recorded lines, were estimated. The intensity in the table above is expressed as follows W weak, M medium, M S medium to strong,S strong and VS very strong. Zeolite ZSM 39 often satisfies, in terms of moles of anhydrous oxides per 100 moles of silica, the following chemical formula 0 2.5 M2 n0 0 2.5 A1203 100 SiO2 wherein M is at least one cation having a valence n. In the as synthesized form, the zeolite usually has a formula, after dehydration, in terms of moles of oxides per 100 moles of silica, as follows 0 2.5 R20 0 2.5 M2snO 0 2.5 A1203 lOO SiO2 wherein M is an alkali or alkaline earth metal and R20 is the oxide form of an organic compound of Group VB element of the Periodic Chart of the Elements FisherScientific Company, Cat. No. 5 702 10, 1978 , preferably nitrogen or phosphorous, containing at least one alkyl or aryl group having between 1 and 7 carbon atoms, preferably between 2 and 5 carbon atoms, preferably containing at least one ethyl group and still more preferably R20 is a quaternary ammonium compound. Zeolite ZSM 39 may have small amounts of Al, Fe and or Cr in positions of tetrahedral substitution within the silica lattice. To this extent, the latter possesses a negative change, one excess electron for each atom substitution, which is balanced by cations. These cations may be replaced at least in part by other ions using conventional ion exchange techniques. Due to pore blockage, in some cases, by the R20 species it may be necessary to calcine the zeolite prior to ion exchange.Ions introduced to replace the original alkali, alkaline earth and or organic cations may be any that are desired so long as they can pass through the channels within the zeolites. Especially desired replacing ions are those of hydrogen, ammonium and metals of Groups I through VIII of the Periodic Chart. Among the metals those particularly preferred are rare earth metals, manganese, zinc and those of Group VIII of the Periodic Chart. Differing cationic forms of the zeolite reveal substantially the same X ray diffraction pattern with minor shifts in interplanar spacing and variation of relative intensity. Other minor variations can occur depending on the silica to alumina mole ratio of the particular sample as well as its thermal history. Zeolite ZSM 39 can be used as catalyst or adsorbent either in the alkali metal form, e.g. the sodium form the ammonium form the hydrogen form or another univalent or multivalent cationic form. When used as a catalyst the zeolite will be subjected to thermal treatment to remove part or all of the organic constituent. The zeolite can also be used as a catalyst in intimate combination with a hydrogenating component such as tungsten, vanadium, molybdenum, rhenium, nickel, cobalt, chromium, manganese, or a noble metal such as platinum or palladium where a hydrogenation dehydrogenation function is to be performed. Such component can be exchanged into the composition to the extent Al is in the structure, impregnated therein or intimately physically admixed therewith. Such component can be impregnated in or on to it such as for example, by, in the case of platinum, treating the zeolite with a solution containing a platinum metal containing ion. Thus, suitable platinum compounds include chloroplatinic acid, platinous chloride and various compounds containing the platinum amine complex. The above zeolite especially in its metal, hydrogen, ammonium, alkylammonium and arylammonium forms can be beneficially converted to another form by thermal treatment. This thermal treatment is generally performed by heating one of these forms at a temperature of at least 371or 7000F for at least 1 minute and generally not greater than 20 hours. While subatmospheric pressure can be employed for the thermal treatment, atmospheric pressure is desired for reasons of convenience. The thermal treatment can be performed at a temperature up to about 9270C 17000F . The thermally treated product is particularly useful in the catalysis of certain hydrocarbon conversion reactions. The new zeolite when employed either as an adsorbent or as a catalyst in one of the aforementioned processes should be dehydrated, at least partially. This can be done by heating to a temperature in the range of 2040C 4000F to 5930C 11000F in an atmosphere, such as air, nitrogen, etc. and at atmospheric, subatmospheric or superatmospheric pressures for between 1 and 48 hours.Dehydration can also be performed at room temperature merely by placing ZSM 39 in a vacuum, but a longer time is required to obtain a sufficient amount of dehydration. The new zeolite can be prepared from a reaction mixture containing a source of silica an oxide of silicon R20 an alkali metal oxide, e.g. sodium water and optionally alumina, and having a composition, in terms of mole ratios of oxides, falling within the following ranges REACTANTS BROAD PREFERRED R20 SiO2 .01 100 .05 20 M2 nO SiO2 .01 10 .02 5 A1203 SiO2 0 1.0 0 .5 wherein R20 is the oxide form of an organic compound of an element of Group VB of the Periodic Chart and can be a compound containing one ethyl group, M is an alkali or alkaline earth metal, and maintaining the mixture, at crystallization temperatures, until crystals of the zeolite are formed.When prepared without alumina, any alumina that may be found in the product is introduced as an impurity in some other component of the crystallization medium. A material prepared without added alumina and with no aluminum present as an impurity would have no ion exchange capability, since it contained no aluminum. Such substance would be considered a zeolite for the purposes of this disclosure. In preparing zeolite ZSM 39 the preferred alkali metal oxide is sodium and the preferred source of R2 0 is tetraethylammonium TEA ions or n propylamine, with, preferably, tetramethylammonium ions added in varying amounts to the reaction mixture. Crystallization is performed in the temperature range from 930C 2000F to 204at 4000F generally, but at lower temperatures e.g. less than 930C 2000F , crystallization time is longer. These times vary from about 6 hrs to 90 days. Thereafter, the crystals are separated from the liquid and recovered. The composition can be prepared utilizing materials which supply the appropriate oxide. Such compositions include sodium silicate, silica hydrosol, silica gel, silicic acid and sodium hydroxide. The organic compounds can be any element of Group V8 such as nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony.The preferred compounds are quaternary compounds generally expressed by the formula R4L wherein L is an element of Group VB of thePeriodic Chart, and each R is an alkyl or aryl group having between 1 and 7 preferably 2 5 carbon atoms, preferably at least one R group is an ethyl group. While normally each alkyl or aryl group will be the same, it is not necessary that each group have the same number of carbon atoms in the chain. In preparing an ammonium species, the organic substituted ammonium chloride or hydroxide is useful. In preparing the phosphonium species of the zeolite, tetraethylphosphonium chloride is particularly desirable as a means of incorporating the quaternary metal compound in the zeolite.The other elements of Group VB behave similarly and thus zeolites containing the same can be prepared by the same manipulative procedure substituting the other Group VB metal for phosphorous. It should be realized that the oxide can be supplied from more than one source. The reaction mixture can be prepared either batchwise or continuously. Crystal size and crystallization time of the new zeolite composition will vary with the nature of the reaction mixture employed and the crystallization conditions. The quaternary compounds need not be used as such. They may be produced in situ by the addition of the appropriate precursors. These precursors comprise a compound characterized by the formula R1R2R3L whereR1, R2 and R3 are selected from alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl, substituted aryl, cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl and hydrogen and L is an element of Group VS and a compound of the formula R4L where R4 is alkyl, substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl, aryl and. substituted aryl and L is an electronegative group. According to a special embodiment of the invention, the method of the invention can be practised using the compound R1R2R3L alone. Thus, in specific embodiments one may use as the source of R20, amines or phosphines either primary, secondary or tertiary as well as diamines without addition of anyR4X. The zeolite may be formed in a wide variety of particle sizes. Generally speaking, the particles can be in the form of a powder, a granule, or a molded product, such as an extrudate having particle size sufficient to pass through a 2 mesh Tyler screen and be retained on a 400 mesh Tyler screen. In cases where the catalyst is molded, such as by extrusion, the zeolite can be extruded before drying or dried or partially dried and then extruded. In the case of many catalysts it is desirable to composite a zeolite with another material resistant to the temperatures and other conditions employed in organic conversion processes. ZSM 39 may thus be composited with a matrix of the kind and quantity described in ourEuropean specification 1695. Employing a catalytically active form of ZSM 39 associated with a hydrogenation component, heavy petroleum residual stocks, cycle stocks, and other hydrocrackable charge stocks can be hydrocracked at temperatures between 2040C 4000F and 441oC 8250 F using molar ratios of hydrogen to hydrocarbon charge in the range between 2 and 80. The pressure employed will vary between 170 and 17338 kPa 10 and 2,500 psig and the liquid hourly space velocity between 0.1 and 10. A catalytically active form of ZSM 39 can be employed for catalytic cracking, hydrocarbon cracking stocks can be cracked at a liquid hourly space velocity between about 0.5 and 50, a temperature between abo,ut 2880C 550OF and 5930C 1100OF , a pressure between about subatmospheric and several hundred atmospheres. Employing a catalytically active form of ZSM 39 associated with a hydrogenation component, reforming stocks can be reformed employing a temperature between 3710 7000F and 5380C 1000at , The pressure can be between 791 and 6996 kPa 100 and 1000 psig but is preferably between 1480 and 4928 kPa 200 and 700 psig .The liquid hourly space velocity is generally between 0.1 and 10, preferably between 0.4 and 4 and the hydrogen to hydrocarbon mole ratio is generally between 1 and 20 preferably between 4 and 12. A catalytically active form of the zeolite of this invention can also be used for hydroisomerization of normal paraffins, when provided with a hydrogenation component,.e.g., platinum. Hydroisomerization is carried out at a temperature between 930C 2000F and 3710C 7000F , preferably 1490C 300OF to 2880 5500F , with a liquid hourly space velocity between 0.01 and 2, preferably between 0.25 and 0.50 employing hydrogen such that the hydrogen to hydrocarbon mole ratio is between 1 1 and 5 1. Additionally, the catalyst can be used for olefin isomerization employing temperatures between 10C 30OF and 371at 7000F . Other reactions which can be accomplished employing a catalytically active form of ZSM 39 with or without a metal, e.g., platinum, include hydrogenation dehydrogenation reactions and desulfurization reactions, olefin polymerization oligomerization , aromatics alkylation, aromatics isomerization, disproportionation, transalkylation, and other organic compound conversion such as the conversion of alcohols e.g. methanol to hydrocarbon . In the examples which follow whenever adsorption data are set forth for comparison of sorptive capacities for water, cyclohexane and n hexane, they were determined as follows A weighed sample of the calcined zeolite was contacted with the desired pure adsorbate vapor in an adsorption chamber, evacuated to lmm and contacted with 12 mm Hg of water vapor and 20 mm Hg of cyclohexane and n hexane vapor, pressures less than the vapor liquid equilibrium pressure of the respective adsorbate at room temperature. The pressure was kept constant within about 0.5 mm by addition of adsorbate vapor controlled by a manostat during the adsorption period which did not exceed about eight hours. As the adsorbate was adsorbed by the zeolite the decrease in pressure caused the manostat to open a valve which admitted more adsorbate vapor to the chamber to restore the above control pressures.Sorption was complete when the pressure change was not sufficient to activate the manostat. The increase in weight was calculated as the adsorption capacity of the sample in g 100g of calcined adsorbent.Examples 1 and 2 A starting gel mixture was prepared from colloidal silica 30 SiO2 , tetraethylammonium hydroxide 40 , tetramethylammonium hydroxide 25 , sodium aluminate and water. In Example 1, crystallization was achieved with stirring at 3200F for 70 hours. InExample 2, crystallization was conducted without agitation at 1540C 3100F for 330 hours. After crystallization, the solids were separated from any unreacted components by filtration and then water washed followed by drying at 110 C 2300F . The amounts of starting materials, identification of same and product compositions are listed in Table 2.Examples 3 and 4 A starting gel reaction mixture was prepared from sodium silicate 28.8 SiO2, 8.9S Na20, 62 H20 , obtained commercially as Q brand , tetramethylammonium chloride 50 , n propylamine, sulfuric acid and water. In Example 3, crystallization was achieved with stirring at 1600C 3200F for 53 hours.In Example 4, crystallization was attained without agitation at 160 C 3200F for 48 hours. After crystallization, the solids were separated from any unreacted components by filtration and then water washed followed by drying at 1100C 230OF . The amounts of starting materials, identification of same product composition and adsorption data are set forth in Table 2 herein. The X ray diffraction pattern of the zeolite produced according to the procedures of Example 4 is set forth in Table 3.Example 5 The dried product of Example 4 was calcined for 3 hours at 5380C 1000of in flowing nitrogen. The calcined product was then ion exchanged twice with a large excess of 0.1 N NaCl 0.1 N NaOH solution for two hours at room temperature. The resultant washed product had a sodium content of 0.21 wt. . The X ray diffraction of the resultant zeolite product of this Example is given in Table 4.
