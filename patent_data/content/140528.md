Disclosed is an apparatus for storing data wherein there are at least two storage units which are addressed by different addressing schemes. The primary storage unit is addressed with a unique addressing scheme while the other storage units are addressed with a scheme wherein more than one of the other addresses may map to a single unique primary address. The apparatus for storing data includes a mechanism for translating all of the unique primary addres ses to all of the other addresses which map to that unique primary address.
