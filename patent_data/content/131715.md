## Description
Magnetically sensitive junction transistorThis invention relates to magnetically sensitive junction transistors and, more particularly, to transistors having an emitter, a base and at least one collector, the base forming PN junctions with the emitter and the collector and having the emitter base junction biased into injection of minority carriers and the base collector junction biased to collect minority carriers, the emitter having at least one injection area for minority carriers thereon and developing, in the presence of an externally applied magnetic field, a maximum torentz potential of positive, negative and null values distributed across one surface of said injection area and created by the interaction of said injected carriers and said externally applied magnetic field.A variety of magnetically sensitive transistor structures have been previously described in the prior art. For example, US A 3,389,230, US A 3,533,159 and US A 3,692,595 are known to exist. Also known is a paper by V. Zieren published by the IEEE in cH1616 2 80 ooo 0669, 1980 pp.669 672 this paper details a new structure essentially along the lines and of the general organization shown in the aforementioned U.s. patents, having an elongated emitter centrally located between two laterally spaced elongated collectors, the collectors being on opposite sides of the emitter and parallel thereto. Magnetically sensitive devices are also shown inEuropean publication 63209 of the applicant of the present invention.A chief difficulty with the known prior art lies in the fact that these devices presumed that the magnetic transduction mechanism was via the deflection of electrons or injected carriers by the magnetic field.Attempts were made in these devices to enhance the deflection from the emitter toward one collector or the other. The general structures used an elongated emitter and two parallelly spaced collectors straddling the emitter on each side thereof. The long axis of the emitter and of the collectors in these devices is parallel with the magnetic field vector to which the device is sensitive. By adopting such a configuration, these devices failed to recognize or utilize the newly discovered transduction mechanism utilized in the present invention.The invention as claimed is intended to provide an improved magnetically sensitive transistor in which the collector to emitter orientation is optimized to take advantage of Lorentz field modulation of emitter injection.The present invention is also intended to provide an improved magnetically sensitive transistor in which means are included for limiting or controlling the dominant area of carrier injection from the emitter to a specified smaller portion of the total emitter base junction area.As described herein, the foregoing objects of the present invention are met by providing, in a magnetic transistor configuration having an emitter, a base and one or two collectors, means for limiting or controlling the dominant area of injection of carriers from the emitter into the base.Preferably, the dominant injection area is approximately confined to a specified portion of the total emitter base junction area. Furthermore, the configuration of the geometry of the collectors relative to the emitter and base is such that the collector lies to one side, or with two collectors, on opposite sides of an imaginary plane bisecting the dominant area of injection on the emitter surface. This results in spacing the collectors equally about the null point in the Iorentz field potential developed across the Lorentz potential development area of injection on the face or faces of the emitter surface. By this technique, the maximum effect of a lorentz field potential can be developed and applied for modulation of carrier injection from the primary emissive surface.Both lateral and vertical structures are described in both avalanching and non avalanching modes of operation. The avalanching mode devices employ the impact ionization promoter areas as described in US A 4,276,555 andUS A 4,288,708.Figure 1 illustrates a plan view in schematic form of an embodiment of one type of magnetic transistor constructed according to the present invention and showing its mode of employment for sensing.

This mechanism was discovered while investigating the various configurations and operative parameters of the devices described in the aforementioned US A 4,276,555 and US A 4,288,708. The new transduction mechanism is called Lorentz field induced modulation of injection at the emitter, or simply torentz modulation of injection. The transduction mechanism is operative both in avalanched collector magnetic sensors and in non avalanched collector magnetic sensors, as described herein. The sensor constructed according to the teaching of the present invention exhibits sensitivities close to the theoretical limits which are achievable by solid state devices.A special investigative structure and a series of critical experiments are described herein which reveal the basic nature of the transduction mechanism. A theoretical analvsis is also given that describes the effects of the transduction mechanism in terms of the injection modulation principle propounded.The basic magneticallv sensitive transistor structure will be described first with relationship to an embodiment of a three terminal, open base, lateral transistor operated in the avalanche mode. This transistor is shown in figures 1 and 2 and comprises two collectors, one base and one emitter together with impact ionization promotor regions or means as described in the previously noted US A 4,276 r 555 and US A 4,288,708. A differential output voltage may be sensed at the equal load resistors Rt connected to the two separate collector terminals, and a response signal may be measured between the collector terminals.The amplitude and polaritv of the output signal for a given current level is proportional to the intensity and direction of a magnetic field introduced to the device in the vicinity of the emitter base PN junction. The device responds most strongly to magnetic fields having components directed perpendicular to the axis of carrier velocity and parallel to the emissive face or surface at which dominant injection occurs.Turning to fiqure 1, a plan view of the operative portions of a transistor constructed according to the present invention is shown. It should be understood that the overlying shield electrode which also forms the emitter connection is not shown in figure 1. Furthermore, the collectors and emitter are understood to be embedded or implanted in a substrate forming the base of the transistor. Two separate heavily doped N type collector diffusion regions 3 are illustrated spaced apart from one another by a distance of approximately 2.5 micrometers. A heavily doped N type emitter diffusion 1 is separated laterally in the bodv of semiconductor material forming the base 2 by a P type base region having a length W as shown.The length W is measured between the collector faces 3A and the emitter face 1A. It will be seen that, in this embodiment, both collectors 3 lie on the same side of the emissive face 1A of the emitter 1 relative to the emissive surface 1A. The base region 2 is floating. That is, it is not electrically connected, but the emitter base junction injects and is forward biased because of the holes produced in the avalanche process, thus effectively supplying proper polarity and magnitude to bias the emitter base junction in to injection.Without base current being supplied, a negligible beta characteristic may be anticipated. However, due to the impact ionization promotion means 5, those carriers which are injected from the emitter and which successfully traverse the distance W will be multiplied by the avalanche phenomenon so that the overall effect of the transistor is approximately the same as a non avalanching mode device operated with a base contact supplying base current. An overlying shield 6 of metal is connected to ground and supplies the emitter potential through contact 7 to emitter 1. It also supplies, through a metal region overlying thin areas 5 in the silicon dioxide insulator 4, areas of increased electrical field between the shield and the collectors 3. These act to accelerate electrons traversing the base region 2 near the junction of the base with the collectors 3. The resulting carrier velocity is sufficient to cause impact ionization and avalanche generation of excess minority and majority carriers to occur. In the embodiment illustrated, the emitter base junction area oriented toward the collectors and identified as 1A is oriented parallel with the base collector junctions 3S which face it. In general, the collector PN junctions should be equidistant from the orimary emissive surface or surfaces of the emitter 1. While a parallel configuration is shown, it is obvious that a circularly shaped emitter rev ion and arcuately concentric collector elements could be employed as well. A rectangular emitter withU shaped collectors about its end is also aporoximately the same as the arcuate configuration. These will be described in greater detail as an alternative embodiment.Also, it is possible to develop the modulatingLorentz potential on one part of the emitter and supply its potential to the primary area as will be shown later.As noted earlier, the device as shown in figure 1 responds most strongly to magnetic fields having a vector component perpendicular to the direction of injection of the carriers along the X axis as shown in figure 1 and parallel with the primary emissive surface of the emitter 1 as shown in figure 1. An additional constraint is that the major dimension of the dominant Lorentz developing emissive surface IA should preferably be bisected by an imaginary plane constructed perpendicular to the emissive face 1A. This plane bisects the major dimension, in this case in the Y axis direction, and passes through the Lorentz potential null point on the emissive surface.The magnetic vector components of greatest effect will be those lying parallel to the dominant Lorentz developing and in this case7 also the dominant or primary emissive area emissive surface lA, parallel to the bisecting imaginary plane lying essentially along the X axis and bisecting the major dimension in the y axis of the emissive surface 1A and will be perpendicular to the vector direction in the X axis of the minority carriers injected by the emissive surface 1A. In other configurations where the torentz developing area is not the dominant emissive area, the geometrical constraints relative to the placement of the imaginary plane still apply to the Lorentz area, but may not apply to the primary emissive area to be modulated in injection.To prevent the development of offset voltages, it is also preferred, although not necessary, that the individual collectors 3 be symmetrically located on opposite sides of the previously mentioned imaginary plane. That is, the separation between the two collectors 3 should be bisected by the same imaginary plane that bisects the major emissive surface dimension on the face 1A of the emitter 1. If this constraint is not fully met, a slight offset voltage due to the collection of more current at one collector than the other will occur. This can be easily balanced by varying slightly one of the load resistors Rt shown in figure 1. Indeed, as will appear later, single collector devices can be constructed to operate quite well, and balancing can still be easily achieved.Appropriate electrical potential is applied between ground and the collector contacts 8 through the load resistors RL, and in avalanching devices, by the avalanche condition, to forward bias the emitter base junction into injection of minority carriers and to reverse bias the base collector junctions to collect the minority carriers. Those excess carriers which may be generated by the avalanche condition occurring in the region near the collector base junctions due to the action of the accelerator electrode 6 are also collected. Bipolar devices not in avalanche require a base contact and power supply as will be described later.The regions in figure 1 labeled P1 and P2 are the impact ionization promotor areas as described in US A 4,276,555 and in US A 4,288,708. They consist essentially of thinner areas in the oxide layer 4 overlying the surface of the substrate 2 which makes up the base of the transistor structure in this lateral embodiment. These and other elements of figure 1 are described in connection with figure 2. The corresponding elements in the different figures will have corresponding identification characters.Turning to figure 2, a cross sectional view taken along the section line AA in figure 1 is illustrated for the preferred embodiment illustrated in figure 1. The emitter diffusion 1 and the collector diffusions 3 are separated by a distance W and have facing surfaces 1A and 3A oriented toward one another as shown. There are, of course, other surfaces of the emitter and collector diffusions as shown in figure 2. These surfaces could be the bottom as viewed in figure 2 or the rear surfaces facing away from one another and, of course, end surfaces not shown in figure 2. As will be described later, it has been found most desirable in this embodiment of the present invention to control or limit primary injection at the emitter to only one of its faces or to an area of one face only.The torentz potential may be developed there and applied to modulate injection or it may be developed at another injection area and applied to the primary area as will be shown. Various means are described for modifying the base by properly positioning the base contact or by adding means for limiting the predominant area of injection of minority carriers from the emitter to a preferred region or face thereof, or for favoring only a preferred area of the total emitter base junction area.The collector contacts 8 are not shown in figure 2 because of the position of the cross section view taken from figure 1, but they may be understood to be similar to the connection 7 shown for the emitter contact. The thin region 5 in the oxide layer 4 is also visible in figure 2. Through the action of the electrode metal 6 which is connected to ground, carriers traversing the base region 2 near the collector base junction area are accelerated to cause impact ionization of the base material and concommitant generation of excess minority and majority carriers. The minority carriers are collected by the collectors 3 and appear as collector output current. As will be discussed below, the balance between the amount of current received at one collector versus the other can be modulated by a unique phenomenon occurring at the dominant emissive surface 1A. The impact ionization promotion regions shown in figure 1 as P and P may 1 2 also be constructed by a heavy P type doping in the vicinity of the collector base junction facing toward the emitter 1. This generates a greater minority carrier acceptor concentration than the general P type base region and will cause impact ionization to occur more readily at these base collector PN junction areas.The two identical load resistors RL are connected to the collector diffusions 3 through the collector contacts 8 as shown in figure 1. A voltage Vcc above a critical value must be applied to cause impact ionization to occur at the collector base junctions within the regions P1 and P2 shown in figure 1. The ionization process creates majority carriers holes which traverse the base width W and recombine with excess minority carrier electrons spontaneously injected at the emitter base junction. The excess carrier recombination current thus occurring within the base 2 accounts for a majority of the emitter current. Emitter current will be seen to consist of the sum of the individual collector currents.If the device is constructed with a symmetrical layout as shown in figure 1, it may be assumed that essentially identical quiescent current operating conditions will occur in the absence of applied magnetic fields. That is, the two individual collectors 3 should experience approximately identical collector currents if they are symmetrically disposed with respect to one another and to the emissive surface or surfaces of the emitter 1.Returning now to a discussion of the operative transduction phenomenon occurring in this device, some elaboration is necessary. Intuition would suggest perhaps that the application of a magnetic field directed perpendicular to the surface of a base region in figure 2 or figure 1 would cause a torentz force deflection of the electrons traversing the base region and unbalance the current. This would be further amplified by avalanche generation of excess carriers in the area of P1 and P2 which will eventually be collected by the individual collectors 3. Intuition might also suggest that such deflection would occur in such a manner that the sum of the two collector currents would remain essentially constant.As will be shown subsequently, a substantial current imbalance is created at the collectors and may be sensed at the terminals A and B, but by a means entirely different than the intuitive mechanism suggested above. The actual transduction mechanism is more subtle and far more effective than the intuitive Lorentz deflection model and will be seen as a new and heretofore totally unknown effect.For identifying and locating the operative transduction mechanism, manv structures similar to figure 1 and figure 2 were fabricated. Various parameters were changed in the devices constructed. Such parameters were varvina substrate resistivity, varying the promotion area for impact ionization, and varying the base widths and lengths. All of the devices operated as magnetically sensitive structures, but some were better than others. The fundamental problem hindering optimization of these devices stemmed from the lack of understanding of the magnetic transduction mechanism and the relationship of the transduction mechanism to the avalanche current and voltage properties of the structure.To investigate the properties more fully, a unique experimental magnetically sensitive transistor structure was fabricated for test purposes. This structure is illustrated in figure 3 in a plan view similar to that of figure 1. it is illustrated in cross section in the section indicated as AA in figure 3 by the cross sectional view in figure zA. ith reference to figures 3 and 3A, the device is essentiallv identical to the structure shown in figures 1 and 2, except for the addition of two base contact regions B1 and B2. The other elements in these figures are the same as those in figures 1 and 2. For the device illustrated in figure 3 the base length, i.e., the distance between the emitter and the base contacts was chosen as approximately 25 micrometers. This basic length yielded a vertical VI characteristic in avalanche similar to that shown in figure 4.A series of critical experiments was performed in two parts. In the first part, an external variable resistor was connected between ground potential and the base contact B1.During this portion of the experiment, the base contact B2 was left floating. In the second portion of the experiment, the variable resistance was connected between ground and the base contact B2, leaving the base contact B1 floating. In both portions of the experiment, a sinusoidal magnetic field described as 400 sin 120sot gauss or 4.0 x 10 sin 120st tesla was introduced parallel with the Z axis normal to the surface of the base region of the transistor. During this time, the value of the resistive connection through the resistor to qround was varied. A starting result was obtained during the first phase of this experiment.Specifically, the amplitude of the magnetic response signal measured between the two collectors passed through a null point and then the siqnal output changed phase as the value of the resistor connected between ground and the base contact B1 was varied. The result is sketched in figure 5.The signal null obtained was absolute. The only signal observed was that of random noise at this point. This experimental observation led to the suggestion that magnetic transduction mechanisms operative in the device must be located somewhere near or within the emitter depletion region because of the proximity thereto of the experimental separate base regions.The hypothesis to account for this observed variation of phase and amplitude in the output signal was developed as follows.Let it be supposed that injection from the emitter is modulated along the major axis of the emissive surface or that in which dominant injection occurs taken along the width of the emitter base junction 1A or 1B, as below identified. The modulation may be by means of the Lorentz potential which is created in the Y axis by the action of the Z directed magnetic field components interacting with the X directed vectors of the minority carriers injected at these surfaces of the emitter.In figures 3 and 3A, the axis coordinates are defined and are adhered to henceforth herein. The X axis is chosen as the direction of the velocity vector of the minority carriers leaving perpendicular to the emissive surface and moving toward the collector or away from it initially if the carriers are emitted on the back face of the emitter . The Y axis is chosen transverse to the minority carrier velocitv vector. The Z axis is directed perpendicular to the plane of the X and Y axes, or normal to the substrate surface for the lateral device as shown in figures 1 3. Injection will be occurring around the entire surface of the emitter basePN junction and may be assumed to occur in the front face 1A, the rear face 1B, the bottom surface and the end surfaces as well. We will momentarily consider only that injection occurring along the front and back faces 1R and 1B for simplifying the present description. Injection from the bottom surface can be neglected for this comparison but is important in other models since the cross product against maqnetic vectors directed to the Z axis will be zero and no Lorentz field potential will be generated by vectors oriented thusly with respect to the bottom surface of the emitter.The end surfaces are neglected due to their small size relative to the dominant area of injection along the long axis and major dimension of the dominant emissive area.It will be observed from a review of figures 3 and 3R that the X directed vectors of carriers leaving the emitter surfaces IA and 1B will be in opposite directions. If the Lorentz field potential is developed at the emitter base junction areas along the Y axis due to the interaction of these injected carriers and the magnetic field component in the Z axis, then the polarity of the Lorentz potential voltage developed along the width of the emitter face will be opposite on the front face 1A to that developed along the rear face 1B. This is illustrated in figure 1 for example by the notation VL and the positive and negative signs located along the emissive faces of emitter 1.It will be assumed for the time being that this Lorentz field potential, produced either at the dominant injection area or elsewhere, may modulate the injection of minority carriers along the dominant emittinq surfaces. If the field acts with or against the junction potential occurring at the emitter base junction, a higher proportion of minority carrier injection would be seen to occur at the end of a face of the emitter where theLorentz potential is positive and that lower injection would occur at the opposite end of the same surface where the Lorentz field acts opposite to the junction potential.That is, at one end of the emitter surface, theLorentz field potential would tend to enhance the fonvard bias potential and cause a heavier injection rate of minority carriers at the opposite end of the same surface it would tend to reverse bias the junction potential and reduce the amount of injection occurring there.If it is assumed that both the front and rear faces of the emitter, IA and 1B respectively, might inject carriers with equal current density and both are subject to the same magnetic field components, then there should be no net magnetic response signal measured between the collectors. The effects should be observable since oppositely directed torentz potential injection modulation effects would cancel one another at the collectors. If, however, total injection were found to be different along the front or rear emitting face, then a magnetic response signal should be measured between the collectors, regardless. It may be seen that the polarity or phase of the output response signal would depend on whether injection was dominant along the front or rear face of the emitter.This is so because the carriers most predominantly emitted from the front or the rear would be most heavily emitted at the left or the right as shown by the positive signs in figure 1 and would traverse the distance to the collector through the base material.Their movement towards the collectors is essentially without interaction or significant Lorentz force deflection as will be seen later, and except for recombination with majority carriers which may be assumed to occur at a more or less equal rate, they will reach the collector areas.It may be assumed that the dominant injection of minorifr carriers will occur at the emitter base junction surface facing the collectors and that the Lorentz field modulation of the injection proportions could be detected with the base contacts Bl and B2 left floating. Any dominance of injection from the front face versus the rear face would result in an arbitrarily designated phase A magnetic response signal measured between the collectors. Connecting the base contact B1 to a resistor connected to ground would terminate some of the holes traversing the base region which originated within the ionization interval near the collectors. The local recombination rate would lower injection along the front face of the emitter base junction with contact B1 thus connected.This would leave iniection at the rear face lB essentially unaltered.As may be seen from the foregoing assumptions and the demonstrated experimental result, the null output signal in figure 4 would correspond to identical injection and modulation levels at both the front and rear faces of the emitter base junction. A reduction in the level of injection from the front face relative to that at the rear face of the emitter base junction would cause injection modulation, if anv occurs, to occur at the rear face and dominate the signal behavior measured between the collectors.The observed phase reversal of the output signal response measured in the experiments is thus in agreement with the hyPothetical model and proposed physical explanation.One may now speculate what should be observed experimentally if the base contact B2 were connected to ground through a variable resistor while base contact B1 were left floating. If it is assumed as before that the base open configuration allows emitter injection and modulation, if any, to dominantly occur along one face or the other of the emitter base junctions, then lowering the injection occurring at the rear surface should enhance the magnetic signal due to the injection occurring at the front surface. Such a result has been confirmed experimentally. The phase A signal response is more than doubled when the base contact adjacent the rear surface lB is connected to ground. Thus, it may be seen that if the phase B signal is removed, the phase A signal is increased.It is believed that the experiment just described clearly demonstrates the general location and nature of the magnetic transduction mechanism as Lorentz potential modulation of emitter injection. As will be seen later, the position of the base contact relative to the emitter is an important means of controlling or limiting the area at which dominant injection occurs from the emitter. The remaining problem is that it is desirable to discover where the Lorentz modulation of emitter injection may occur, tçhether it be within the emitter depletion region or just outside that region.Returning to figure 1 for a discussion of Lorentz field modulation of emitter injection, the collector currents for the left and right collectors 3 may be simply stated as I and I . These may be shown to be related to c1 c2 the equivalent leakage current by expressions 1 and 2.EMI17.1 EMI18.1 where I is the equivalent leakage current at the left collector. o1 I is the equivalent leakage current at the right collector. O2 V be is the base emitter voltage consisting of the sum Vfb V VL Y , i.e. the base emitter forward bias potential due to avalanche conditions plus a Lorentz potential VL y . The Lorentz potential available for injection modulation is the Lorentz voltage Vt directed along the Y axis in figure 1. It is distributed along a contour which corresponds to the width of the emitter base junction on the surface facing toward the direction of the collector surfaces. Given aZ directed magnetic field and an x directed carrier velocitv vector, theLorentz potential contour will be developed parallel to the Y coordinate across the face 1A of the emitter 1.The origin of the coordinate system shown in figure 1 is chosen to be the center of the emitter base junction area which faces the collectors. TheLorentz potential is zero null at the coordinate origin due to the symmetry consideration. It will be recalled that the collectors and the emitter are oriented with respect to one another so that an imaginary plane bisecting the maximum Lorentz developing emissive surface IA and perpendicular to the surface 1S will divide the two collectors 3 symmetrically one from another in the preferred embodiment.This plane, it will be seen, will also pass through the Lorentz potential null or zero along the emissive face 1A. It should be emphasized here that this Lorentz potential is developed across the same area which is the primary injection area, but it could be developed elsewhere and applied to the primary injection area.The magnitude of the Lorentz field E y depends on the vector cross product of carrier velocity in the X axis which is an axis normal to the emitting surface 1A and upon the magnetic field component B directed normal to the z surface of the base region. This magnetic field vector will be seen to be parallel to the imaginary plane intersecting the emissive surface IA and parallel with the missive surface itself. The magnitude of the Lorentz field depends upon width of the area and on the average carrier velocity, not on the number of carriers. As pointed out earlier, it is necessary to carefully observe that the Lorentz field potential is not dependent upon current whereas the Lorentz force is. The Lorentz potential V developed along the right half of the emitter PN L2 junction surface facing toward the collector having an ionization promoterP2 can be expressed as follows EMI19.1 The Lorentz potential V developed along the left half of the emitter PN L1 junction surface facing toward the collector having ionization promoter P1 is expressed as EMI19.2 where uy is a unit vector inductionIt is evident from these expressions that the Lorentz field potential will increase linearly with increases in the Y axis dimension of the emissive surface.The average Lorentz field potential developed along either half of the injecting emitter surface will be one half the value developed at a position measured along the Y coordinate at You2. Thus, these averageLorentz field potentials can be expressed as shown in expressions 5 and 6 EMI19.3 where Y is the maximum total width of the emitter. o It is evident that some maximum Lorentz potential will be developed for any given arranoement of carrier velocit vector and flux field direction that will be a maximum across the maximum dimension of the emitter surface perpendicular to the vector for carrier velocity.Equations 1 and 2 previously given mav now be expanded in view of the definition given for the base to emitter potential voltage. The new voltage will equal the base emitter forward bias voltage zulus the Lorentz field potential as shown b expressions 7 and 8. EMI20.1 Expressions 7 and 8 may be further simplified bv recognizing that the coefficient To as multiplied by the first extonential term in the O1 equations is simply the quiescent collector current I . Thus co EMI20.2 where EMI20.3 Taking the difference between equations 9 and 10 yields the differential current as shown by expression 11 EMI21.1 where VL is the average Lorentz potential. In expression 11 it may be noted that the factor 2I is equal to the C emitter current I given a base open configuration. It is appropriate, e however, to express the differential current in terms of collector current, not emitter current. The two currents differ by the value of the base current 1b By substituting expression 5 into expression 11 , one obtains expression 12 EMI21.2 From the foregoing expression, it is apparent that the Lorentz potential modulation of emitter injection can be a verv efficient transduction mechanism, indeed. Optimization of the sensitive axis of response depends upon controlling the location of the emitter injection, or at least of the dominant portion of the emitter injection. The Lorentz potential differential will be transformed exponentially into a current differential for which the maximum efficiency of current transformation is defined as shown by expression 13 EMI21.3 As is evident from expression to2 , the differential current induced in the device as shown in figure 1 will, for a given magnetic field strenght in the Z axis and a given emitter width y , depend upon the carrier velocitv.Injected carriers are normally injected perpendicular to the surface formed by the emitter base junction and hence, their velocity vector will be directed normal to that surface. It is evident from expression 11 that differential current will vary linearly with the Lorentz potential provided that the Lorentz potential is less than KT The differential magnetic signal voltage measured between the collector terminals A and B in figure 1 is not simply the product of the signal current shown in expression 12 and the value of the load resistor RL in figure 1. Because the lateral transistor as shown in figure 1 is operated in the avalanche mode, a relatively low impedance is developed between the collectors.The impendance is defined as the avalanche resistance RA and is on the order of 500 ohms at nominal collector currents of two or three milliamps. The avalanche resistance is typical of devices exhibiting essentially a vertical VI property like that shown in figure 4.The avalanche resistance for a given device can be easily measured in the laboratory by observing the deviation in the avalanche collector potential as a function of collector current in response to an externally applied base current. Introducing external base current simulates the change in collector voltage in response to modulating emitter injection. The fact that the avalanche resistance is relatively low in value minimizes the effects of stray capacitance and therefore partiallv accounts for the high frequency capabilities of devices of this type.The 500 ohms figure for avalanche resistance RA will be used throughout the analysis sections which follow, its derivation being the substance of a future paper, but being unnecessary for the present invention since the actually observed resistances can be utilized for the analysis.A hypothetical explanation for the observed phenomenon and an experimental demonstration appearing to verify the hypothesis have been given which tend to show that the magnetic transduction mechanism appears to be located at the emitter base PN junction. Expression 12 above describes the differential collector current induced by application of a magnetic field in the region in question. A question still to be answered by this portion of present discussion is what carriers are involved in the Lorentz potential and precisely where are thev located In expression 12 all of the parameters are known except for the carrier velocity directed along the X axis.The purpose of this section of this treatise is to show that the carriers traversing the emitter space charge region are responsible for the Lorentz potential modulation of emitter injection, and not those carriers diffusing from the emitter and recombining in the base outside the emitter depletion region. To demonstrate this hypothesis, the average diffusion velocity of the carriers just outside the emitter depletion region due to excess carrier diffusion and recombination effects will be calculated. This expression for velocity will then be substituted in expression 12 , An expression for the differential output voltage will be developed and compared with the actual experimental result.Following this comparison, a computation will be made for the same output signal potential that would result if the carriers traversing a portion of the emitter depletion region reached the maximum thermal saturation 7 velocity of approximately 10 centimeters per second. Returning to the first part of this proposed analysis, assume that the average velocity of the carriers traversing the emitter depletion region is due to the diffusion current at the emitter edge of the base region. The intense electric depletion field will be ignored in this analysis since, for this circumstance, the current flowing in the emitter depletion region is identical to the diffusion current at the edge of the emitter depletion region. Thus,EMI23.1 Solving 14 for average velocity V gives EMI23.2 here EMI23.3 EMI24.1 The effective mobilitv of the excess holes and electrons created within the base region by the collector avalanche conditions. N x Concentration of excess minority carriers within the base b region as a function of position. Pb x Concentration of excess majority carriers within the base region as a function of position.The polvnomial expressions for excess carriers have been developed in another paper and are summarized below. Their derivation is not essential to the present invention and is thus omitted.EMI24.2 where a 1 alpha t at Carrier transport factor w Lenght of lateral base region.By taking the derivative of the expressions 16a and 16b and evaluating the expressions for the given position on the x axis where x is O yields the following EMI24.3 For typical avalanche conditions, the current transportation factor an 1 t is much less than 1 and hence the expression described by equation 17a will be the dominant factor. By substituting expression 17a into expression 15 , we obtain an expression for the average diffusion or recombination velocity, expressed EMI25.1 a 1 alpha tEvaluating expression 18 , one finds that the average diffusion velocity 4 of 2 x 10 centimeters per second is reasonable for minority carriers leaving the edge of the emitter depletion region. Neglecting temporarilv the fact that the exponent n depends on current, the diffusion velocity given by expression 18 is essentially independent of collector current.Substituting expression 18 into expression 12 and replacing D with KT q ields the following expression for differential collector current EMI25.2 4ultiplvina expression 19 by the avalanche resistance factor RA, yields the following expression for the signal output voltage EMI25.3 Equation 20 is evaluated below for the following nominal conditions. RA 500 ohms I 3 x 10 amps n 4 yo w 1 8 ê B 10 volt sec cm per gauss ê 500 cm volt sec. From which AE 1.5 x 10 volts gauss .15 volts tesla 21 The output signal voltage AE is two orders of magnitude below that actually measured in the laboratory. It may therefore be concluded that the recombination velocity V is too low to account for the measured device sensitivity.We will now consider the output voltage predicted for this device as shown in figure 1 if the carriers traversing a portion of the emitter depletion region are sustained at or near the thermal saturation velocity of approximately 1O centimeters per second see figure 6 for the typical carrier velocities versus electrical field strengths known to exist for semiconductor materials .For this case, expression 12 becomesEMI26.1 Evaluating expression 22 yields E 3.5 x 10 3 volts gauss 35 volts tesla 23 where RA 500 ohms Io 3 x 10 amps KT q .026 e.v. Vs 10 cm sec 8 ê Bz 10 volt sec cm yo 1.2 x 10 cmThe differential magnetic signal voltage predicted by expression 23 is very close to the value actually measured of approximate lv 3 millivolts per gauss.Based upon the experimental evidence and the above calculations, it is concluded that the magnetic transduction mechanism lies within the emitter base depletion region and specifically near the stochastic PN junction where both the depletion region field and the carrier velocities reach a maximum value.it is also important to recognize that the carrier velocity is directed normal to the injecting surface of the emitter.The carrier velocity in the emitter depletion region is next investigated.Figure 6 is a typical plot of carrier velocity versus electric field for electrons and holes in both silicon and gallium arsenide. The plot was obtained from page 59 of Semiconductor Physics by Sze, a common reference work in the field. From this reference, it is quite apparent that electrons may remain at thermal saturation velocity for fields as low as 1 x 10 volts per centimeter. However, holes in silicon require fields of 5 approximately 10 volts per centimeter to achieve the same thermal velocities.Based upon this observation and upon experience with both NPN and Prw silicon magnetic transistor structures, gallium arsenide would appear to have the most promise for high velocity and field characteristics for use with either avalanching or non avalanching devices according to the 7 present invention. A saturation velocity of 2 x 10 centimeters per second is predicted for electrons in gallium arsenide at fields of approximately 4 x 10 volts per centimeter. This material continues to exhibit velocities 7 of 10 centimeters per second given fields as low as 10 volts per centimeter.Consideration now will turn to how the forward biased emitter base junction potential is influenced by the avalanche condition or by base current and how the field within the depletion region behaves with the net bias potential. Bipolar and avalanche types of devices are thus both involved.A collector current flowing in an avalanche device is essentially due to recombination of excess carriers generated by impact ionization. As has been shown in US A 4,276,555 and US A 4,288,708, excess carrier recombination currents equal to the difference between diffusion current at the extreme ends of the base region, that is at a position X 0 and X W.The diffusion current at X W is reduced from the injection current by the n 1 transport factor alpha t . For normal avalanche current levels below complete destruction, the diffusion current at X W is insiqnificant compared to that at the emitter PN junction which is at the X 0 position because the transport factor is much less than 1 at the collector end of the base region. Consequently, the collector current flowing in a base open avalanche transistor device can be closely approximated by examining the diffusion current at the X 0 position therefor,EMI28.1 Equation 24 is evaluated as follows in view of the expression 17a . IC N AeqD Nb o a 25 w Solving expression 25 for Nb o yieldsEMI28.2 And solving expression 26 for the forward bias potential Vfb yields EMI28.3 The base emitter contact potential IP is known and is given as follows.EMI28.4 Taking the difference between and Vm yields the following expression for the net potential developed across the emitter base junction.EMI28.5 for Nê N Nb O i A b This expression is essentially the same for avalanching and non avalanching magnetic transistor devices according to the present invention. It is desirable for a given collector current I, that the device maintain as c large a net junction potential as practical in order to maintain high depletion region fields and high carrier velocities. The electric fields 0 developed at the stochastic emitter base junction due to the ionized acceptors and donors NA and ND respectively, is given below in terms of the net junction potential II Vfb . EMI29.1 where ND donor concentration of emitter N A acceptor concentration of base. By substituting expression 29 into expression 30 and assuming that N D is much much greater than NA yields the following EMI29.2 4Fields as intense as 10 volts per centimeter can be realized given typical collector current conditions, it is apparent from expressions 29 and t31 that it will be desirable to heavily dope the emitter region in order to maintain relatively intense junction fields.It is also evident from expression 29 that the emitter will cease to inject electrons if the minority carrier concentration Nub or equals the donor concentration ND Furthermore, the electric field within the emitter depletion region will diminish together with carrier velocity as the minority carrier concentration given in expression 26 approaches the donor concentration ND For this reason, it is desirable to have the 19 emitter dopant levels greater than 10 cm From all of the foregoing analysis, it is apparent that the most useful devices will employ some means for controlling the region at which the dominant emitter injection of minority carriers occurs so that a modulated signal without degradation from other areas can be achieved. Some means must be developed for controlling or tending to limit the dominant area of injection of emitter base junction area to some portion less than that of the total area. As will be seen shortly, several such means have been found. However, it is first necessary to more fully consider the effects of injection from other areas of the emitter which mav not contribute to the desired output.Referring momentarily to expression 12 , it is evident that the differential magnetic signal current is at least proportional to the following factors collector current, carrier velocity and the width Y of 0 the Lorentz contour portion of the emissive surface developing the Lorentz voltage. The analysis that developed expression 12 neglected all the degenerate injection at the emitter base junction.Degenerate injection does not lead to a signal current at the collectors or may actually lead to an opposing signal component if any. It can be shown that non opposing degenerate emitter injection diminishes the current transduction efficiencv given by expression 13 by a factor related to the emissive area as a portion o the total area defined by the following expression EMI30.1 where A is the emitter area where Lorentz voltage modulation of injection e occurs and leads to phase A type response. A is the total injecting emitter area. Portions of the injecting e emitter region may not be perpendicular to the desired magnetic field.The experiments described above in connection with the device shown in figure 3 demonstrated that the controlling or approximate restricting of emitter injection to a preferred area facing the collectors should be allowed and that injection elsewhere on the emitter base junction should be suppressed or discouraged, except for the purpose of developing a controlling Lorentz potential. It is shown bv expression 12 that the differential current Al is directly proportional to the modulatable collector current.Equation 25 given above describes the emitter current in terms of the minority carrier concentration injected into the base at the x o position. For a given emitter base forward bias potential, the minority carrier injection rate is inversely controlled bv acceptor concentration at that junction. This situation is summarized bv expression 33 .EMI31.1 Degenerate magnetic signal components arising from injection at the emitter junction areas not facing toward the collectors or not responsive toLorentz injection modulation effects can and should be suppressed.Suppression may be accomplished by providing a heavily doped acceptor region of P type around the emitter diffusion and beneath it, in fact surrounding it except along the junction face high injection and Lorentz injection modulation are desired. The technique of localized injection limiting means is illustrated in figure 7A. It should be clearly understood that, for purposes of generating a Lorentz potential to be used for modulating injection from the primary injection area, it is not necessary to have a high level of injection. Only a relatively low level of high velocity carrier injection is necessary in the Lorentz potential area in order to develop a highly effective modulating potential for application to the primary injection area.In figure 7A, a plan view of a device similar to those shown in figures 1 3 and including a p injection suppression pocket zone 9 is shown surrounding all but the face 1A of emitter 1. A cross section taken through the device shown in figure 7A appears in figure 73 where the nature of the P pocket may be better understood. The emitter diffusion 1 is positioned relative to the P pocket 9 so that the portion of the emitter base junction area facing toward the collectors 3 is outside of the P pocket. This leaves the face 1A exposed while all other surfaces of the emitter diffusion lie within the pocket.The emitter P pocket rev ion should have at least one order of magnitude greater acceptor concentration than the normal P type base region 2 where injection is desired.Alternative means for localizing injection to occur predominately in a selected region of the emitter base PN junction are illustrated in figures SA and SB. In the configuration shown in figure SA, the silicon substrate 2 which forms the base material is provided with a blanket acceptor ion dosage to form a continuous concentrated acceptor pocket everywhere within the substrate 2 except in the region of the base which separates the front face 1A on the emitter 1 facing toward the collector base junctions. The blanket P pocket is deep enough as shown in figure SB to also prevent significant minority carrier injection at the bottom face of the emitter diffusion.There is another method which mav be used to affect or control some degree of localized emitter injection. This control means depends on the position of the contact made to the base region of devices operated below avalanche conditions. For example, consider the lateral bipolar transistor shown in figure 1. The contact for the base not shown is made in back of the collectors and close to the collector diffusions. The length of the base contact region is essentially equal to the length of the emitter diffusion.The base contact is parallel to the collectors and to the emitter and farther from the emitter than from the collectors. Positioning the base contact in this manner, tends to favor injection at the emitter base junction area facing the collectors. Intuition would also suggest that placing the base contact between the emitter and collector would favor injection at the front of the emitter as desired. However, it has been discovered experimentally that this technique leads to very high levels of injection noise.It has also been discovered experimentally that the same lateral bipolar transistor of figure 1 can be caused to exhibit vertical injection properties, i.e., dominant injection at the bottom surface of the emitter diffusion. This behavior was accomplished by placing the base contact in back of the collectors i.e., the collector lies between the base and the emitter as described previouslv. However, the contact position must be a considerable distance away from the emitter, tvpicallv a distance in the order of the substitute thickness. A similar result can be achieved by making the base contact on the back side of the substrate directly below the emitter. It is desirable to place the base contact farther away from the emitter than from the collector and, preferably, to have the collector between the base contact and the emitter.This base contact control technique leads to operational bipolar transistor devices which are sensitive to magnetic fields directed parallel to the dominant injecting surface. However, the results of using this technique alone are inferior to those achieved by regionally controlling injection.As noted earlier, this may be done either by inhibiting injection elsewhere, by increasing the doping level within the base region surrounding selected surfaces in contact with the emitter diffusion or by enhancing injection by selective doping. Both injection control techniques may be practiced simultaneously with excellent results, and, in the preferred embodiments described later, both techniques are used.The foregoing means for limiting the dominant area of injection of minority carriers from the emitter to a specified smaller portion of the total emitter base junction provide a way of maximizing the ratio given in expression 32 asEMI33.1 Optimization of this ratio leads to the most sensitive uniaxial magnetic sensing devices.There are certain implications of the basic transduction mechanism just described. The basic mechanism is shown to be Lorentz field modulation of emitter injection. It was discovered by exploring the different avalanche type magnetic transistor configurations. The details leading to the discovery were given above. Utilization of the fundamental mechanism is not restricted, however, to avalanche devices or to avalanche device behavior.Many optimum dual or single collector bipolar transistor configurations have been constructed according to the present invention utilizing this mechanism. These sensor configurations are basically four or three with a single collector terminal devices as opposed to the three terminal, two collector devices typical of avalanche transistor structures because the base contact must be provided with current.Two basic non avalanching transistor configurations both in lateral and in vertical or epitaxial structure form may be quickly shown. For both configurations, the base length W should be much shorter than that needed b in avalanching transistor devices. Short base lengths are required to realize the current gain factor ss 1. In contrast, ss may be much less than 1 in the avalanching transistor devices since the avalanching effect in the impact ionization promotion regions will multiplv what few carriers actually reach the area up to essentially unity transfer proportions.The regional means in the base for limiting the predominant area of injection to only a portion of the emitter base junction are like those described above and are also essential for optimization of the non avalanching devices. Figure 9A illustrates a basic lateral non avalanching magnetically sensitive transistor device. The configuration is very similar to that shown in figures 7A and 7B except that the base length Wb is approximately 3 micrometers or less and a base contact region 10 has been added.As can be seen from the cross sectional view of the device 9R shown in figure 9B, the P suppression pocket completely surrounds both the emitter and the collectors except for the region identified in figure 9A as region 11 where an effective base window of lower P type concentration than the pocket exists. No ionization promotion regions or means are required at the collector baseJunctions since the device is operated below the avalanche collector potential. In the configuration shown, the emitter 1 is rectangular in form, for example, and is diffused into the injection control P pocket region 9. The device configuration is sensitive to magnetic fields applied normal to the surface of the base, i.e., in a vertical direction as shown in figure 9B. The collector current I is proportional to the base current 0 applied to the base terminal through base contact 10. A differential collector current is induced by the Lorentz modulation of minority carrier injection along the maximum dimension of the localized emitter base junction area facing the collectors in the manner described above.The magnitude of the differential current is given bv the following expression.EMI35.1 here ssI is collector current b ss is current gain Ic Ib The efficiency of the current transduction mechanism is similar to that derived for the avalanching transistor device for equal quiescent current conditions. That is, for SI I . Identical local levels of emitter b o injection or suppression are also assumed. The magnetic transduction efficiency is maximized when the emitter current is dominated by the emissions from a region of the surface area such as the portion of the emitter base junction surface facing toward the collectors or collector.The velocity vector at the injecting emitter surface which is used to develop the Lorentz potential will determine the most sensitive magnetic axis.For example, if injection were controlled to occur preferentially at the bottom surface of the emitter 1, the device would be most sensitive to magnetic components directed in the x axis rather than the Z axis, where the axes are oriented like in figure 1. Such devices are illustrated by figures 14A, 14B and 15A and l5B. Devices using the Lorentz potential developed by bottom surface injection to modulate injection at other areas are shown in figures 16 through lav An expression for the differential voltage developed at the collector terminals is obtained by multiplying expression 34 by the load resistanceRL and yields the following EMI36.1 The differential magnetic transduction voltage of this lateral non avalanching transistor device is similar to that of the avalanche device if the load resistors RL are set equal in value to the avalanche resistance RA described above. The upper cut off frequencv of these devices is predicted to be in the range of 100 megahertz or more for the avalanching transistor device and somewhat less for the non avalanching device based on distributed capacitive effects and not on transit tine considerations. To improve the frequencv response of non avalanching type devices, low resistance values such as 600 ohms should be used for the load resistors RL. As alluded to earlier, vertical or epitaxial structures of these devices are also operable and have been constructed as shown in the following figures.Figures 10A and 10B r lIA and lIB illustrate plan view and cross sectional schematics for vertically integrated non avalanching magnetic sensor devices according to the present invention. The dominant injecting emitter surface faces the collectors and is positioned either below or above the rectangularly shaped collectors by an epitaxially grown P type base thickness of approximately 2 micrometers.The device is sensitive to magnetic fields applied parallel to the substrate surface and normal to the maximum dimension of the rectangular emitter diffusion that is perpendicular to the carrier injection vector. The carrier velocity vector is in the figures 10A and lOB directed parallel with the Z axis and the differential current and voltage response signals are derived from the magnetic transduction mechanism given by expressions 34 and 35 respectively.A P pocket region 9 surrounds the sides of the emitter i to limit injection as shown in figure lOB to the bottom surface of the emitter 1 surface 1A. Figures IlA and lIB illustrate the inverse type of structure in which the collectors 3 overlie the emitter region 1. In this configuration, the base or substrate itself can be of P material to surround the emitter on all surfaces except for the top surface 1A at an epitaxial layer of P material providing an injection enhancing window area facing the collectors 3 as shown in figure llB.For the devices shown in figures 10 11, high magnetic sensitivity is achieved by constraining the emitter injection to lie in the Z axis normal to the X Y plane. For example, injection is suppressed around the perimeter of the emitter in figure lOB by the use of the P pocket that surrounds the emitter diffusion 1 and which has a depth identical to that of the emitter diffusion.In figure llB injection at the rear surface and edges of the emitter diffusion 1 is suppressed by the heavy dopant level of the P substrate into which the emitter itself is diffused.By these means, the emitter injection and the resulting Lorentz potential modulation of that injection will be essentially confined to the surface of the emitter total PN junction area which faces toward the collectors. Both of the vertically integrated structures exhibit a current gain factor S of 10 or more and exhibit high magnetic field sensitivity.Figures 12A and 12B are generic and are meant to provide a basis for distinguishing these structures from other known magnetically sensitive devices. As will be seen in these figures and in the discussion which follows, the physical orientation and placement of the collector or collectors relative to the emitter and the sensitive axis for magnetic fields are different in all of these present devices from those known in the past.Figure 12A illustrates a partial plan view of a typical device constructed according to the present invention. The P pocket 9 surrounds the emitter 1 on all sides except for surface 1A which is oriented facing toward the collector face or faces 3A of collector s 3. The maximum dimension of the injecting surface 1A is of the dimension W and the corresponding maximumLorentz potential V is developed across that width as shown in figure 12A. LAn imaginary plane Z is shown perpendicularly bisectina the maximum width of the emitter area or of the dominant emitter area. it also bisects theLorentz potential contour since, by definition, the contour potential will be 0 at the midpoint of the width across which the Lorentz potential is developed. The plane Z also separates the two collectors 3 as shown in figure 12A. In these figures, the Lorentz developing area and the primary injection area are identical as will appear later, this is not necessaryAs shown in figure 12B, a sectional view taken along the section line AA indicated in figure 12A, the face of emitter 1 defined as face IA is emitting carriers primarily in the X axis direction and has a maximum dimension W.It is across this maximum dimension that the Lorentz potential contour is developed. This device will be most sensitive to magnetic vector components in the Z axis directed perpendicular to the XY plane. Relative to the emissive surface or to the dominant area of injection 1A, it will be seen that both collectors 3 lie on the same side of that surface, and with each collector 3 on one side and the two collectors on opposite sides of the Z plane. In the preferred embodiment, the two collectors 3 are equidistant from a predominant emissive surface 1A. This is shown by the parallelism in figure 12A and in the circular or concentric configurations of figures 13A and 13B. In figure 13A, a circular diffused emitter 1, slightly greater in diameter but of less depth than a deeper diffused circular P pocket 9, confines the dominant area of injection to the periphery of the circular injector surface 1A. The cross section in 13C illustrates this point. The arcuately shaped collectors are equidistant in the perpendicular direction at all points from the corresponding facing emissive surface lA, lie on opposite sides of the imaginary Z plane, and the plane passes through the emissive surface perpendicular to it and bisecting the Lorentz potential contour passing through its null on it along its maximum length, in this case measured as its circumference. An outer concentric arcuate base contact is also shown and functions as described previously for rectangular configurations.Turning to figures 14A and 14B, a vertically injecting, lateral, bipolar, non avalanching, magnetically sensitive transistor structure is also illustrated. In this structure, the device is best understood from its cross sectional view in figure 14B taken along the section line AA shown in figure 14A. The elements are essentially the same as those previouslv described, except that it will be seen that the P limiting pocket 9 effectively shields the front, rear and end surfaces of the emitter 1 to greatly reduce injection there, leaving only the bottom surface 1A for dominant injection. Such a device will be sensitive to the magnetic field vectors as shown in figure 14B.These pass parallel to the imaginary Z plane which perpendicularly intersects the surface 1A. They are parallel with the primarily dominant injecting surface 1A as previously described. An avalanching version of the device shown in figures 14A and 14B is illustrated in figures 15A and 15B. The impact ionization promotion regions Pi and P2 No. 5 are illustrated in the top or plan view of figure 15A and are seen to be of the thin oxide field enhancement type in figure 15B. It is, of course, well understood that increased P dopants in the vicinity of the collector base diffusion may also be used to enhance impact ionization.Some specific examples of the preferred embodiments, their parameters and manufacturing steps will now be given. Referring to figures 9A and 9B, a lateral bipolar magnetic transistor is constructed in the following manner.The first step is to grow an initial oxide laver about 6500 A thick on the surface of a 5 Qcm P type substrate. The next step is to implant the entire substrate with boron ions everywhere except in a P base window. To accomplish this step, a mask is used to remove the initial oxide layer from the surface of the silicon substrate except in the region where it is not desired to implant boron. Boron is then implanted with an energv of 13 ê approximately 100 KEV and a dose of approximately 6.8 x 10 ions cm Drive in is then accomplished at approximately 1150 C, for a time interval 1 enough to attain a P layer of approximately 0. Q cm and a depth of approximately 4 microns. The next step in the process is to diffuse both collector and emitter regions.The emitter region is approximately 1.8 x 10 cm long and 3.8 x 10 cm high. The collector regions are similar in length and approximately 4.5 x 10 cm high. Both emitter and collector diffusions are approximately 2 microns deep and exhibit a sheet resistivity of about 10 ohms per square. The collectors are spaced apart from one another by a distance of approximately 2.54 x 10 cm. The base widths Wb of typical devices are in the range of 1 x 10 cm to 4 x 10 cm. Finally, contacts are made to the collector and emitter diffusions and to the substrate in back of the collectors to form the base contact.The avalanche structure of figures 8A and 8B is fabricated in a similar manner. Since this magnetic transistor is operated in the avalanche mode, there are two major structural differences. The first difference is the base length Wb typically 2.7 x 10 cm long. The second difference is the use of ionization promoter regions P1 and P2. These regions are formed by growing a thin oxide layer 1000 A thick to form an insulator between the collector diffusions and the shield. This thin oxide layer is only under the promoter regions P1 and P2. The oxide thickness elsewhere is typically 7000 A.The structure of figure 7A is quite similar to the avalanche structure of figure 8A. The major difference is the location of the injection suppression region 9 in this figure. This heavily doped P region is implanted in a manner similar to that described in connection with figures 9A and 93. Base width Wb, ionization promoter and diffusions are the same as those used to fabricate the structure of figure 8.Figures llh and 113 illustrate an epitaxial bipolar magnetic sensor. This device is constructed in the following manner. An N type emitter is formed by diffusing arsenic into a 0.1 0cm P type substrate. The emitter is rectangular with the following dimensions. Length 2.0 x 10 cm. Height 2.5 x 10 cm and depth is approximately 2 micrometers. The emitter exhibits a sheet resistivity of approximately 10 Q per square. A 4 micron thick P type layer in the range of 0.5 to 2 Qcm is then epitaxially grown on the surface of the P type substrate containing the emitter diffusion 0.After growing the P epilayer, an emitter contact, phosphorous, diffusion is accomplished and driven into a depth of approximately 4 microns. This diffusion must make contact with the arsenic emitter region lying below the epilayer. Collector regions are then diffused into the P epilayer and thermally driven into a depth of about 2 micrometers. The base reqion which separates the collectors from the emitter results in a depth of approximately 2 micrometers. Contacts are then made to the collector, emitter and base regions.Referring to figures 14A and 143, this structure is a vertical injecting lateral bipolar magnetic transistor. A P pocket region 9 is implanted into a 5 0cm substrate except in a narrow slit within the emitter region 1, figure 14R, where vertical injection is to occur. This slit has the following dimensions. Length 2 x 10 cm, height 2 x 10 cm and a depth of approximately 3 micrometers. The base width Wb separating the 2 micrometer deep emitter and 1 micron deep collector diffusion is typically in the range of 1 x 10 cm to 5 x 10 cm. The collector and emitter diffusions have a typical sheet resistivity of 10 ohms per square.The oxide thickness is grown to about 7000 A and the space between collector diffusions is typically 2 x 10 cm. Contacts to the emitter, collectors and base are made in the usual manner well known in the art.Having described several types of new magnetic transistors with regard to preferred embodiments thereof and having given a complete description of the theory of operation and mode of construction, some variations of these devices may be expected. A generalized description of devices which employ the broad concept of Lorentz potential generation in one area for use in that or in another dominantly injecting area will soon be given. Some general observations follow.For example, some of the devices illustrated are basically avalanche transistor devices operating above avalanche breakdown conditions. Some devices, on the contrary, are lateral bipolar transistors or vertical bipolar transistors which operate below avalanche breakdown of the base collector junction. The transduction mechanism is ident cal for all of the devices and has been described as being a Lorentz field modulation of emitter injection. The Lorentz modulating potential reaches the theoretical limit for solid state devices and is transformed exponentially into a differential current by transistors of this class. The specific choice of a device or its geometry is governed by the requirements of a specific application.The magnetic sensitivity of various devices can be fixed to a desired level less than about 5 millivolts per gauss 50 volts per tesla .Signal to noise ratios of between 5 and 10 per gauss given a bandwidth of 1 megahertz appear at this time to be reasonably attainable for both types of devices. To realize this signal to noise ratio, bipolar devices require a ss gain of approximately 10 or more. The avalanching device, due to its low collector impedance, has a higher frequency capability and is sensitive into the range of 100 megahertz or more. Both types of devices, however, have very small sensitive areas and may exhibit high resolution capabilities. As will be seen from the foregoing discussion, by placing both collectors on the same relative side of the emissive surface, i.e., both facing the same emitting surface instead of placing the collectors, as in some prior art devices, on opposite sides of the emitter surface, the device is able to utilize the unique Lorent potential modulation of emitter injection effectively. If separate emitter surfaces are used, as they can be, for each collector, the collectors will each face their own emissive surface.In the prior art devices, the collectors were not positioned to utilize the Lorentz potential contour developed along the maximum dimension of the predominant injection area. In addition, special limiting means in this invention have been incorporated to limit or control the predominant area of injection to a portion of the emitter base PN junction which is less than the total thereof.The foregoing devices were provided with means to achieve a dominant emitter injection surface along which a maximum Lorentz potential can be developed. This potential is created by a magnetic field applied parallel to that injecting surface and nominally oriented perpendicular to its length. The Lorentz potential developed along the length of the injecting region was also described as modulating the level of minority carrier injection occurring along the length of that region. When two collectors are positioned parallel to and equidistant from that injecting surface on opposite sides of an imaginary plane drawn perpendicular to and bisecting that injecting surface and passing through the Lorentz potential null point, a maximum differential collector current is produced by application of the magnetic field.Figures 16 through 18 illustrate a different magnetic sensor configuration.The basic concept of Lorentz modulation of emitter injection is optimized in these structures. In these devices, a Lorentz potential is developed along a first injecting region which is separated from the primary modulated injection region. The Lorentz potential thus developed is applied to a primary modulated injection region to modulate injection there.The first injecting region is called the Lorentz developing region, as opposed to the primary or modulated injecting region. The Lorentz developing region is contiguous with or electrically connected to the primary modulated injecting region and serves to modulate the intensity of minority carrier injection occurrinq there.The devices of figures 16 throuqh 18 are sensitive to magnetic fields directed parallel to the substrate surface. Thev are insensitive to field components directed otherwise. Referring to figure 16, the emitter diffusion is formed in such a manner that it resembles the left half of the letter H. This shape is the result of terninating the horizontal ll member of the emitter dip fusion the Lorentz potential developing region at one end with a vertical H member, thus forming the left half of the letter H.The vertical H member of the emitter acts as the primary injection region.A collector diffusion is positioned opposite to and parallel with the vertical primary emitter injection region. Contact is made to the base or substrate in such a manner that the collector is positioned between the base contact and the primary injecting surface. It is thus positioned parallel with both collector and emitter and closer to the collector than to the emitter. Positioning the base contact in this manner enhances minority carrier injection from the surface of the primary injection region which faces the collector. This base contact arrangement also stimulates injection to occur underneath the Lorentz developing region of the emitter diffusion. This vertical injection component is necessary to provide the device with its magnetic behavior. The magnetically sensitive axis is parallel to the injecting surface of the Lorentz region.The response is a maximum when the field is directed perpendicular to its length the horizontal portion of the emitter diffusion . A magnetic field thus applied reacts with the minority carriers injected therefrom and creates a Lorentz potential along the bottom surface of the Lorentz developing region within the depletion zone developed at the emitter P N junction. The total value of the Lorentz potential developed between the center of the Lorentz developing region and its end is supplied to the primary injection region by the emitter. The intensity of this Lorentz potential is proportional to the length of the Lorentz developing region and is responsible for modulating injection occurring at the face of the primary modulated injection region which faces the collector.It is important to note that the full magnitude of Lorentz potential thus developed is applied to the entire primary injection area instead of the graduated potential applied when the Lorentz developing area and primary injection area are the same area.Figures 17 and 18 illustrate dual collector configurations. These structures are similar to the single collector structure of figure 16. A second collector and primarv injection region are positioned opposite the first primary injection region at the other end of the Lorentz developinc region.Referring to figure 17, the orientation of the magnetic field is shown increasing emitter injection in the region facinq the right collector and simultaneously reducing injection of minority carriers from the dominant injecting surface facing the left collector. The opposite situation is illustrated by figure 18 since the polarity of the magnetic field as shown develops a Lorentz potential in the opposite direction.It has already been discussed above that the magnitude of the Lorentz potential depends on carrier velocity and not the number of carriers. The object of the structures of figures 17, 18, 20, 21 and 22 is to minimize the total current injected from the horizontal Lorentz developing region of the emitter where the Lorentz modulating potential is created, and to maximize minority carrier injection at the ends of the emitter where injection modulation is desired. Means for suppression of injection from the Lorentz region of the H structure is illustrated in figures 17 and 18.Referring to figure 17, injection suppression is accomplished around the inner perimeter of the emitter base junction region by increasing the doping level of the base region in this vicinity. This local injection suppression technique is somewhat different from the technique shown in figure 18. For the device in figure 18, the injection level is also reduced along the bottom of the Lorentz developing region of the emitter in addition to suppressina injection along the inner perimeter of the base emitter junction. In both structures, the maximum Lorentz potential is electrically coupled to the primary injecting surfaces close to the collectors. The structures of figures 16 18 are very sensitive magnetic field detecting devices and exhibit low intrinsic noise levels. Sensitivities greater than 1 mv Gauss 10 volts per tesla can readily be achieved from such devices with signal to noise ratios greater than 10 per Gauss 10 per tesla . Turning to figures 20A and 20B, means accordinq to the present invention of injection suppression at the perimeter of the emitter base junction is schematically illustrated. This technique uses either an etched groove around the perimeter of the emitter base junction or a trench of recessed grown oxide insulator. Using this technique, injection is limited to only the bottom surface 1A of the emitter 1. In the structure shown in figure 20A, injection is vertical and the device will respond to magnetic fields passing in and out of the plane of the paper of figure 20A or at right angles thereto and parallel with the emissive surface.The transduction efficiency and signal to noise ratio are significantly improved in these devices by eliminating lateral or perimeter injection from occurring since injection in those areas is not affected by magnetic fields in a sensible manner.In figure 20S, the substrate 2 is first cleaned and then the deep N diffusion of the collectors 3 is carried out in the area shown for the collectors in figure 20B in plan view. Following this, the wider and somewhat shallower diffusion of P material is deposited to construct the base of the dual collector transistor structure. This material diffuses into the N collector material but not all the way to its bottom surface as seen in figure 2Q. This converts the N material to P in the vicinity where the two N and P materials coincide within the substrate 2.Next, a shallower diffusion for the emitter 1 itself is carried out in the central region of the P material as seen in figure 20A Then, an oxidation mask is applied over all of the surface except for those portions at the edges of the emitter diffusion 1 and designated portions 11. Portions 11 are then oxidized in a high temperature water vapor reaction to create silicon dioxide to a depth below the level at which the emitter 1 has been implanted. This completely isolates the perimeter of emitter 1 and prevents any lateral injection around the perimeter. Next, the surface layer of insulating oxide is grown over the entire surface with the mask removed.Then etchinq is carried out to open up contact holes through the oxide layer for the emitter contacts 7 and the base contacts 10 and the collector contacts 8 seen in figure 2OB. In figure 20B, the plan view shows the section AA which appears in figure 20A and also shows the location of the P base diffusion 9 in relationship to the collector diffusions 3, the recessed oxide isolating barrier 11 and the other elements depicted in figure 20A.An alternative method of constructing this device is to perform the implantation steps as noted but to etch a trench around the perimeter of the emitter 1 in the area designated 11 in figure 20A to remove the material from these zones and then regrow a thin oxide insulator over the entire surface including the V trench groove. Alternatively, diffusion of the collectors followed by epitaxial deposition of the P layer and subsequent etching or oxidation of a trench or groove in the epitaxy can be carried out.It is most desirable to improve frequency response of the magnetically sensitive transistors and to improve the transduction efficiency. This will require a close proximity of collectors to the emitter. However, when the collectors are positioned close to the emitter, they will receive preferentially any contributions from the perimeter injection that may occur around the sides of the emitter. Thus, the perimeter injection may dominate in the output signal. It is thus very important to eliminate or reduce insofar as possible this component of emitter injection since it is not modulated by any magnetic fields because of the orientation of the injected carriers with respect to the magnetic fields.The techniques described for figures 20A and 20B achieve the desired result and also permit very close spacing of the emitter surface IA to the collectors 3.The vertical structure depicted in figures 20A and 20B for a dual collector magnetically sensitive transistor exhibits very high frequency response, high transduction efficiency and is simply and easily constructed using the techniques described.Turning to figures 21A and 21B, an alternative configuration according to the present invention for a transistor having an isolated emitter base junction with injection limited to a single plane is shown. In figure 21A, a plan view of such a structure is depicted in which the substrate 2 has had the overlying layer of oxide later removed for claritv. Base contact 10 and emitter 1 are shown positioned relative to collectors 3 and to a magnetic vector B directed perpendicular to the long axis of the Lorentz developing region on the emitter surface. The oxide barrier 11 is also shown surrounding the emitter 1. In figure 21B, it may be noticed that the depth of the oxide trench 11 is below the level at which the emitter 1 has been implanted or diffused.This totally eliminates any perimeter injection from those surfaces of the emitter base junction so that injection will occur, in figure 21B, only in the vertical direction and will be subject to the maximum effect of the magnetic flux vector passing parallel to theLorentz developing surface IA. The collector 3 can be placed in much closer proximity to the emitter 1 than in other lateral structures depicted in the figures 17 or 15, for example, shown herein. This means that higher frequency response and greater transduction efficiency as well as greater overall signal efficiency will result.Turning to figures 22A and 22B, an alternative arrangement according to the present invention for a dual collector lateral transistor structure for magnetically sensitive devices is shown. The plan view in figure 22A shows the same elements as previously described but the collectors 3 are placed opposite the ends of the elongated emitter 1. In this location, they still reside on opposite sides of a plane passing through the null point of theLorentz developing region on the emitter surface 1 and are subject to differential signals of the maximum potential. The elements in figures 22A and 22B have been given similar numbering to the other figures since they are the same elements. It will be observed that the isolation oxide barrier 11, better seen in figure 22B, extends to a depth below the surface of the emitter 1 so that perimeter injection from the emitter base junction is eliminated. The magnetic vector B thus will intersect the carriers injected from the sole injecting surface of the emitter 1 in a manner to provide the maximum possible effect on emitter injection modulation due to the Lorentz voltage developed.All of these structures exhibit a Lorentz developing area which can be intersected by an imaginary plane perpendicular to the injection surface and passing through the Lorentz null point. The collector or collectors are located with respect to the Lorentz developing region and the imaginary plane in such a manner that each collector is on one side of the plane or the other. The collectors must each have at least half of their total collection area on one side of the plane in order to detect any current changes. In the H shaped or single collector structures, the entire collector is, in each instance, entirely on one side or the other of this plane. The same condition is true for all the other embodiments shown.It can be easily understood that unless more than half of a collector lies on one side or the other, there can be no dominant effect of injection modulation picked up at that collector since its other portion will receive input from the emitter which is equal. Therefore, given that the plane referred to can be constructed in all cases to define the proper placement of the collector or collectors and that this arrangement and operative mechanism has not been heretofore shown in the prior art, it is easy to distinguish devices constructed in accordance with the techniques herein from ordinary transistors and prior magnetic transistors alike.Turning to figure 19, the primary function of figures l9A 19D is to illustrate a means of electrically connecting and balancing out any offset voltages for single and dual collector magnetic transistors to a source of bias potential for use. It is also desired to illustrate their equivalent circuits in figure l9B and to show a means for balancing the D. C.potential measured between output terminals C and C1. Turning to figure 19A, the single collector structure illustrated is similar to the structure shown in figure 16 and works in the same manner its biasing and balancing are obvious in figure l9B. The dual collector structure of figure l9A is similar to that shown in figure 17. The dual collector structure shown in figure 19C is similar to the structure shown in figure 9A. The single collector structure of figure 19C is also similar to figure 9A if one of the collector diffusions is removed in that figure. Figure l9D illustrates a simple potentiometer commonly connected in the base current drive circuit to accomplish balancing for any offset voltages in the collector outputs at quiescence. These referenced structures have already been discussed in detail. All structures illustrated in figure 19 omit for simplicitv the regional base dopant means used in the referenced structures to suppress injection at certain surfaces of the emitter base junction.Having thus described my invention with reference to several preferred embodiments thereof and having taught the basic theory and operative phenomenon associated with employing structures built according to the principles of the invention, many variations and modifications will be evident to those of skill in the art.
