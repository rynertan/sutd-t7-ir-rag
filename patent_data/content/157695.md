## Description
This invention relates to a carrier base material to be combined with a therapeutically active medicament and formed into a solid, shaped unit dosage form having a controlled and prolonged incremental release of the medicament upon administration. Specifically, this invention relates to a mixture of a water soluble nonionic cellulose ether and an anionic surface active agent which is suitable for use in controlled release therapeutic compositions. Water soluble nonionic cellulose ethers have been used as binders, matrices or carrier bases in sustained release solid dosage forms containing active medicaments, accompanied by lubricants and excipient fillers, as needed. Methylcellulose and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, particularly the latter, are among the nonionic cellulose ethers which have been most widely used in this manner. The cellulose ethers are commercially available in various grades under several trade names. The grades available under a given trade name represent differences in composition and molecular weight. Thus, water soluble methylcellulose Methocel A, previously designated as Methocel MC, from The Dow Chemical Co., U.S.A. and Metalose SM from Shin Etsu, Ltd., Japan has a methoxyl content of 27.5 31.5 weight and is available in various viscosity grades. Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose is actually a series of compounds Methocel E, F, J and K, all previously designated as versions of Methocel HG, from The Dow Chemical Co., U.S.A., and Metalose SH from Shin Etsu, Ltd., Japan , each of which has a different chemical composition with a methoxyl content within the range of 16.5 to 30 weight , a hydroxypropoxyl content within the range of 4 to 32 weight and each of which is available in various viscosity grades. Methocel is a registered trademark of The Dow Chemical Co. and Metolose is a registered trademark of Shin Etsu Ltd. Commercial designations of the various cellulose ethers are based on the viscosities of 2 aqueous solutions at 20 C. The viscosities range from 5 cps to 100,000 cps and represent number average molecular weights ranging from below 10,000 to over 150,000 as calculated from the data in Handbook of Methocel Cellulose Ether Products The Dow Chemical Co., 1974 . Christenson and Dale U.S. Pat. No. 3,065,143 and Huber, Dale and Christenson J. Pharm. SCi., Christenson and coworkers proposed that water was rapidly absorbed and formed a gel barrier on the surface of the tablet. Drug release was controlled by drug diffusion from and attrition of the gel barrier. Christenson and Huber U.S. Pat. No. 3,590,117 reported that neither low viscosity grade hydroxypropylmethylcellulose nor high viscosity grade, i.e. 15,000 cps, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose made acceptable long lasting troches. Lapidus Dissertation, Rutgers State University, 1967 and Lapidus and Lordi J. Pharm. Sci., Salomon, Doelker and Buri Pharm. Acta Helv., Sheth and Tossounian U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,126,672 4,140,755 4,167,558 disclosed solid dosage forms containing 4000 cps viscosity grade methylcellulose or hydroxypropylmethylcellulose in combination with various additives including gas generating compounds, e.g. calcium carbonate, and inert fatty materials, so as to be hydrodynamically balanced so that they have a bulk density of less than one in contact with gastric fluid. Schor, Niaglaye and Gaylord U.S. Pat. No. 4,389,393 disclosed sustained release solid unit dosage forms in which the carrier base material constituted less than one third of the weight of the dosage form and consisted of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose of at least 4000 cps viscosity grade, having a methoxyl content of 16 24 weight , a hydroxypropoxyl content of 4 32 weight and a number average molecular weight of at least 50,000, i.e. Methocel J and Methocel K or Metalose 90SH. The use of high viscosity grades of methylcellulose Methocel A and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose Methocel E, Methocel F and Methocel K, in sustained release solid drug dosage forms is also described in a technical bulletin Formulating Sustained Release Pharmaceutical Products with Methocel The Dow Chemical Co., 1982 . The cited prior art discloses that high viscosity grades of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose of various chemical compositions are useful in the preparation of sustained release solid drug dosage forms. However, Schor, Nigalaye and Gaylord U.S. Pat. No. 4,369,172 disclosed that effective prolonged release therapeutic compositions were prepared by using as a carrier base material, a low viscosity grade hydroxypropylmethylcellulose having a hydroxypropoxyl content of 9 12 weight and a number average molecular weight of less than 50,000. Lowey and Stafford U.S. Pat. No. 3,870,790 and Schor U.S. Pat. No. 4,226,849 disclosed that effective sustained release tablets were produced by using as carrier base material, a modified low viscosity grade hydroxypropylmethylcellulose having a hydroxypropoxyl content of less than 9 weight and a number average molecular weight of 23,000, e.g. Methocel E50. The modification was carried out by exposure of the low molecular weight hydroxypropylmethylcellulose to high humidity or moisture and drying in air, resulting in an increase in the carboxyl content of the polymer. Lowey U.S. Pat. No 4,259,314 disclosed the use of a mixture of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose having a viscosity in the range of 50 to 4000 cps, and hydroxypropylcellulose in the preparation of a controlled release pharmaceutical composition. The present invention is directed toward further improvements in carrier base materials containing nonionic cellulose ethers for use in the preparation of prolonged release solid pharmaceutical unit dosage forms. These improvements result from the presence of an anionic surfactant. The addition of 1 of some anionic salts of alkyl sulfates, alkyl sulfonates or alkylaryl sulfonates to 1 aqueous solutions of methylcellulose Methocel A or hydroxypropylmethylcelluloses Methocel E, Methocel F and Methocel K results in an increase in the viscosity of the cellulose ether solution Handbook on Methocel Cellulose Ether Products , The Dow Chemicel Co., 1975 . An increase in the rate of solution of a drug results from the presence of anionic surfactants, such as dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate and or sodium lauryl sulfate, in the dissolution medium or incorporated into compressed drug tablets, containing water insoluble binders, including polyethylene Desai et al., J. Pharm. Sci., Daly, Davis and Kennerly Int. J. Pharm. 18, 201 1984 disclosed that the presence of an anionic surfactant in admixture with a low viscosity grade hydroxypropylmethylcellulose modified as disclosed in Schor U.S. Pat. 4 226 849 , increased the release time of chlorpheniramine maleate in a solid drug dosage form. An object of the present invention is to provide a carrier base material for use in the preparation of orally, bucally, sublingually, etc., administered lozenges and tablets, as well as suppositories and other solid unit dosage forms which have a controlled and prolonged release pattern for a systemically absorbable medicament or active ingredient incorporated therein. Another object of the present invention is to provide a carrier base material which retards the rapid initial release of the active medicament from solid dosage forms containing water soluble nonionic cellulose ethers. A further object of the present invention is to provide a carrier base material having a more prolonged release pattern of the active medicament from water soluble nonionic cellulose ethers. It has now been found that these improvements in a carrier base material can be achieved by admixture of an anionic surfactant and a high viscosity grade water soluble nonionic cellulose ether. According to the present invention, it has now been found that important advantages and improvements over prior art products containing water soluble nonionic cellulose ethers as carrier base materials can be obtained by admixture of an anionic surfactant with a high viscosity grade nonionic cellulose ther. The nonionic cellulose ethers which are effective in the present invention include, but are not limited to, commercially available, high viscosity grades of methylcellulose, including 1500 and 4000 cps viscosity grades of Methocel A and Metalose SM, as well as high viscosity grades of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, including the 4000 cps viscosity grades of Methocel E and Metalose 60SH, the 4000 cps viscosity grades of Methocel F and Metalose 65SH, the 5,000, 12,000, 20,000 and 75,000 cps viscosity grades of Methocel J and the 4000, 15,000 and 100,000 cps viscosity grades of Methocel K and the 4000, 15,000 and 39,000 cps viscosity grades of Metalose 90SH. The use of high viscosity grades of one or more nonionic cellulose ethers as the carrier base material in a solid unit dosage form, has been disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,065,143, 4, 389,393, etc., and various articles loc. cit. . Although these solid dosage forms, e.g. tablets, are characterized by prolonged or sustained release of the active medicament, frequently the release of the medicament during the initial period after the administration of the dosage form, is significantly more rapid than in subsequent periods. This rapid release represents a dumping of the medicament into the gastro intestinal tract, particularly when the carrier is present in low concentrations. This results in an excessive initial concentration of medicament and also reduces the amount of medicament available for release during subsequent periods, i.e. it shortens the total release time. It has surprisingly been found that controlled release, with a decreased tendency for dumping of the active medicament during the initial release period, as well as prolonged release may be obtained from solid dosage forms in which the carrier base consists of a mixture of an anionic surfactant and a water soluble nonionic cellulose ether such as methylcellulose or hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, having a number average molecular weight of at least 50,000. The anionic surfactants which are effective in the present invention include alkali metal sulfates of linear and branched alcohols, ethoxylated alcohols, ethoxylated alkylphenols, ethoxylated acids, ethoxylated amides, oils, fatty esters, alkali metal salts of sulfonates of naphthalene, alkylnaphthalenes, naphthalene condensates, alkyl substituted benzenes, diphenyl derivatives, α olefins, petroleum, oils, fatty acids, as well as the alkali metal salts of dialkyl sulfosuccinates. Representative anionic surfactants include sodium or potassium dodecyl sulfate, sodium octadecyl sulfate, sodium sulfated castor oil, sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate, sodium linear alkylate sulfonate, sodium sulfonated mineral oil, sodium petroleum sulfonate, sodium salt of naphthalenesulfonic acid formaldehyde condensate and dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate. The weight ratio of anionic surfactant to nonionic cellulose ether in the solid dosage forms may be from 0.005 1 to 3 1. The solid dosage forms may contain from 5 to 95 weight of the nonionic cellulose ether. The nonionic cellulose ethers of the present invention may be used with or without prior humidification or similar treatment and when mixed with the anionic surfactant and an active medicament, the mixture has excellent compressibility and the tablets prepared therefrom are hard and dense, have low friability and provide controlled and prolonged release over an extended period. Solid drug forms containing the mixture of anionic surfactant and nonionic cellulose ether of the present invention are stable and the release rate does not change over an extended period of storage. A nonionic cellulose ether having a number average molecular weight of at least 50,000 can be used as the sole cellulose ether, in admixture with an anionic surfactant, in the carrier base material or can be used in admixture in all proportions with other nonionic cellulose ethers having the same or different structure with a number average molecular weight of at least 50,000. A nonionic cellulose ether of the present invention can be optionally mixed with about 0 to 30 by weight of the mixture of a cellulose ether with the same or different structure and a number average molecular weight below 50,000 or sodium carboxymethylcellulose or other cellulose ether. The active ingredient can be of any type of medication which acts locally in the mouth or systemically, which in the case of the latter, can be administered orally to transmit the active medicament into the gastrointestinal tract and into the blood, fluids and tissues of the body without excessive peak concentrations occurring. Alternatively, the active ingredient can be of any type of medication which acts through the buccal tissues of the mouth to transmit the active ingredient directly into the blood stream thus avoiding first pass liver metabolism and by passing the gastric and intestinal fluids which have an adverse inactivating or destructive action on many active ingredients unless they are especially protected against such fluids as by means of an enteric coating or the like. The active medicament can also be of a type of medication which can be transmitted into the blood circulation through the rectal tissues. Thus, the invention is applicable to sublingual lozenges, buccal tablets, suppositories and compressed tablets. The latter are intended to be swallowed in unit dosage form and upon ingestion according to a prescribed regimen give controlled and slow release of the active medicament, while being protected against inactivating gastric fluids. Representative active medicaments include antacids, anti inflammatory substances, coronary vasodilators, cerebral vasodilators, peripheral vasodilators, antiinfectives, psychotropics, antimanics, stimulants, antihistamines, laxatives, decongestants, vitamins, gastro intestinal sedatives, antidiarrheal preparations, anti anginal drugs, antiarrythmics, anti hypertensive drugs, vaso constrictors and migraine treatments, anticoagulants and antithrombotic drugs, analgesics, anti pyretics, hypnotics, sedatives, anti emetics, anti nauseants, anticonvulsants, neruomuscular drugs, hyper and hypoglycaemic agents, thyroid and antithyroid preparations, diuretics, antispasmodics, uterine relaxants, mineral and nutritional additives, antiobesity drugs, anabolic drugs, erythropoietic drugs, antiasthmatics, expectorants, cough suppressants, mucolytics, antiuricemic drugs, and other drugs or substances acting locally in the mouth, such as topical analgesics and local anaesthetics The mixture of anionic surfactant and nonionic cellulose ether having a number average molecular weight of at least 50,000, forms what is called a long acting, slow dissolving carrier of such a nature that it has a protective, demulcent and buffering effect in the body and causes the active medicament to exert its optimum therapeutic action immediately and incrementally for an extended period of time, so that full therapeutic advantage can be taken of the entire or substantially the entire amount of active medicament administered. This unexpectedly high degree of efficiency is a particular advantage of the invention and minimizes the side effects of the medication. In making up tablets containing an orally administrable systemically absorbable active component such as one of the heretofore mentioned medicaments, the nonionic cellulose ether and the anionic surfactant are thoroughly intermixed with the medicament which is in powdered or granular form or in solution, and any other needed ingredients which are conventional in tablet making such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid, lactose, starch, fumed silica, hydrogenated vegetable oil and, in general, binders, fillers, disintegrating agents and the like. The nonionic cellulose ether and the surfactant may be mixed in water, alcohol or other media known in the art, and dried to produce granules before intermixing with the medicament and other ingredients. Alternatively, the medicament may be granulated with nonionic cellulose ether and surfactant before intermixing with the other ingredients. The complete mixture, in an amount sufficient to make a uniform batch of tablets, e.g. 50,000, of which each contains an effective amount of active medicament, is then subjected to tabletting in conventional tabletting machines at compression pressures of 140 to 1125 kg sq. cm. and, because of the use of the specific carrier material of this invention in the production of the tablets, a product is obtained which has the desired hardness, low level of friability and a predetermined controlled and prolonged action and a regular delayed release pattern so that the medicament is available over a period of 0.25 36 hours, depending on the precise tablet size, hardness and the particular carrier composition. In this way, it is possible to produce controlled and slow continuous release tablets in relatively simple and economical manner on a commercial scale as contrasted with the more elaborate and more complex materials and procedures heretofore employed or proposed. The moisture content of the carrier used in the preparation of the controlled release tablets may be in the 0.1 10 range, the lower end of the range being preferable when moisture sensitive medicaments are used. If the moisture content is outside of this range, it may be brought within the range by the use of ambient or hot, dry or wet air, using appropriate equipment including static, convection, forced air or vacuum chambers or other equipment well known to those skilled in the art. The moisture content of the carrier during tabletting influences the integrity of the tablet obtained under a given compression pressure. However, the moisture content has less influence on the controlled release characteristics than the composition of the carrier and its concentration. The release pattern of active medicament from the carrier of the present invention can be controlled according to the particular medication and its intended therapeutic effect. For a sublingual lozenge or tablet, the release pattern may be varied from 0.25 to 4 hours. For buccal tablets, the release period may be 0.25 to 24 hours. For orally administered tablets, the release time may be 2 4 hours, 4 8 hours, 8 10 hours, 10 12 hours, 15 18 hours, 20 24 hours, etc., as desired. For vaginal and rectal suppositories, the release pattern ranges from 2 to 36 hours and can be more or less where indicated. Predetermined release patterns of unusually reliable characteristics can be secured. The invention is of very versatile and adaptable nature giving it a wide range of application and end use.
