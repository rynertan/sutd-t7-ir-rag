# Lubricating oil compositions containing carbamates as dispersing agents and detergents.

## Abstract
Lubricating oil compositions contain as an additive for providing dispersancy and detergency a hydrocarbylpoly ox yalkylene aminohydrocarbyloxyhydrocarbyl carbamate having a molecular weight in the range from 500 to 10,000, wherein the poly oxyalkylene moiety of said carbamate is comprised of oxyalkylene units selected from C₂ C₅ oxyal kylene units of which there are at least sufficient branched chain oxyalkylene units to render said carbamate soluble in said lubricating oil and the aminohydrocarbyloxyhydrocar byl moiety of said carbamate is derived from a diaminoether having from 2 to 60 carbon atoms.
