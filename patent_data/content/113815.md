# Servo system for a magnetic disk file.

## Abstract
A servo system for a magnetic disk file having a voice coil motor VCM actuator generates a position error signal PES from servo information recorded on one of the disks. An electrical model of the VCM is employed through which a measure of the VCM electrical current is passed to generate a simulated PES signal which is continuous even if the regular PES is sampled or intermittent.
