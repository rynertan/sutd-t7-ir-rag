## Description
METHOD AND APPARATUS BOR PREPARTNG MOULDED WAFERS The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for preparing moulded wafers from baking dough, e.g. dough with high sugar content. While it is possible to bake hollow wafers from dough having a low sugar content, e.g. of 5 by weight based on the weight of the dry farinaceous component , without problems arising, when higher sugar content is used special steps should be taken to allow steam and gases to escape and to provide wafers of a satisfactory quality and solidity.It has therefore been proposed, for example, to open the baking mould a few times for a moment during baking, or first to bake a light wafer in the baking mould which is initially only partly filled, and to compress this in a final baking step, after addition of the rest of the dough, in a second cycle of the baking mould. Hollow wafers from dough with high sugar content e.g. 250 600 0, e.g. about 35 145 tend to stick to the baking moulds and, when they are extracted from the baking moulds and during subsequent cooling, can still assume another shape.However, hollow wafers differing from one another in form and dimension are unsatisfactory for filling with, e.g. ice cream, in high speed filling machines. It has already been recommended in US Patent Specification 2,069,027 to restore cones, the circular cross section of which assumes an elliptical shape when they are extracted from the baking mould, to their initial shape in a cooling mould. According to the invention to be described below, hollow wafers can be prepared from a dough of high sugar content, e.g. about 25 to 60 calculated on the weight of dry farinaceous components, e.g. the flour or starch used or of the mixture of these components , which wafers can be given a gatisSactorxly reproducible uniform shape and, in particular, satisfactorily uniform dimensions and shape about their edges at their open ends. According to the invention there is provided a process for preparing a moulded wafer from a dough of high sugar content, in which the wafer is baked in a baking mould, is introduced into a cooling mould while still hot and stiffens there in a shape given to the cooling mould, characterised in that firstly a moulded wafer is baked, starting from a dough with a sugar content in the range 25 60 based on the weight of the farinaceous dough components, the wafer having a light porous structure, and this moulded wafer is solidified while cooling by compressing its structure and surface by reduction of its wall thickness in a cooling and compressing mould. Also provided by the invention is apparatus for carrying out a process for preparing moulded wafers, consisting of baking apparatus comprising baking moulds and a final shaping device, characterised in that the final shaping device is a cooling mould, the hollow mould space of which is smaller than that of the baking mould and corresponds with the accurmately determined dimensions to be given to the finished moulded wafer product. In examples of processes according to the invention, hollow wafers are baked first with very light structure, then introduced into a cooling mould while still hot and pliable and therein, under compression of their structure and surface, in particular by reducing their wall thickness, are solidified or reshaped, and stiffen with dimensions determined by the cooling mould. The hollow space formed by the parts of the baking mould is relatively large with respect to the amount of dough used.The expansion of the dough and the escape of the steam as a result of heating during baking encounter therefore only little resistance. This results in a very light wafer which does not retain its shape sufficiently and may not have the required shape in some places, as e.g. on the upper edge. The final shaping and compressing of the structure therefore occur in the cooling mould, the hollow space of which corresponds with the finished wafer. or the compression the wall thickness can, for example, be reduced by about 15 to 25 , and for example by up to 300 50 , and locally still more. The final shaping and compression occur immediately after the wafer has been extracted from the baking mould and it comes into the cooling mould while hot and soft.The cooling mould remains closed until the wafer in the planned shape has cooled and is solid so that, after it has been extracted therefrom, further deformations can be omitted.It would seem that particularly in the case of a sugar content of the dough of more than 45 , the shape of the wafer obtainec in the cooling mould is retained owing to the sugar frame forming in the baked dough on cooling. The hollow wafers extracted from the cooling mould have a denser structure both within and on their surface and also have sufficient mechanical solidity. In the case of the lightly baked hollow wafer the edge of the opening can be irregular. If compression takes place at the beginning of the cooling in the cooling mould, especially the edge of the opening of the wafer is therefore solidified and finally shaped with accurate dimensions. As a result of this, the wafers get edges which can easily be taken hold of mechanically during the following mechanical operations, such as filling and packing. In a preferred embodiment of the method according to the invention a hollow wafer of a light structure and a particular shape is baked in the baking mould, e.g. in the form of a body with smooth walls and a pattern is pressed into the surface only at the beginning of the cooling. The usual relief of the baking moulds, which brings about, for example, a wafer pattern on the outer face of the wafer, makes it difficult to extract the baked wafers and necessitates the wafers being adapted to a corresponding relief of the cooling moulds. Wafers with smooth walls can be extracted far easier from the parts of the baking mould, which is especially an advantage in the case of a dough of high sugar content which tends to stick moreover, this removes the necessity of adapting them to the relief. The parts of the baking mould are difficult to interch nge as the baking temperature should be strictly observed, so that the usual baking devices are only suitable for baking a certain t ype of wafer. However, if wafers having a smootb surface are baked and finally shaped in the cooling mould, it is very simple to make various surface patterns by changing the cooling moulds, the local surface temperature than being of less influence.In this way, also when a single baking mould is used, differently shaped hollow wafers can be obtained Before or at the beginning of the compression in the cooling mould, a fatty mixture impregnating the wafer is applied to the surface of the still light, hot wafer, which protects the wafer against the penetration of moisture.Because of the porous, light structure of the still hot wafer the liquid fatty mixture penetrates into the wall of the wafer and stiffens while the wafer cools. Especially in the case of wafers for moist fillings, such as, for example, ice cream, it is advantageous to treat the inside in this way. The fatty mixture can be sprayed from the core of the cooling mould to the inside of the hollow wafer or pressed from the core into the wafer. The core can therefore be provided with a channel system for the fatty mixture containing a large number of outlet openings or spray nozzles. The surface of the core can, however, also consist of a sintered metal, the porosity of which enables the penetration of the fatty mixture into the hot wafer. The invention will now be further illustrated by the following detailed description and attached drawings, in which Fig.l shows an example of a lightly baked moulded wafer in the shape of a hollow cone. Fig.2 shows an example of a closed cooling mould containing a finished wafer in the shape of a hollow cone. Fig.3 shows a second example of a lightly baked wafer. Big.4 shows an example of a hollow wafer compressed and reshaped from the wafer shown in Pig.3. Ref erring to the examples of the process and apparatus of the invention as illustrated by Figures 1 and 2, a hollow wafer 1 figure 1 has been baked in approximately the shape of a cone in a baking mould of conventional form and which is not provided with relief. The wafer therefore has smooth surfaces, has a very light, porous structure and would not retain its form sufficiently on cooling. The upper edge is somewhat irregular. While still hot, the thus baked wafer is pressed into the cooling mould shown inPig.2, in which the cone 2 is given its final shape.During a compressing and cooling step in the mo ild, wafer I is pushed between the cooling mould halves 3 and 4 and the cooling core 5 slid into the cooling mould. Because of the reduction of the wall thickness and, if desired, also the height and the diameter, in which case the mould is shaped accordingly , compression of the wall and surface structure occurs. The compression can take place both radially and axially and in the case of an appropriate shape of the hollow wafer 2 it is also possible to provide a different local compression. Thus, for example, not only can the opening edge 6 be formed with very accurate dimensions but, as a result of the locally greater compression, also with greater mechanical solidity.In contrast with the baking moulds for wafer 1, which are not illustrated, the cooling moulds 3 and 4 have a relief, as a result of which a pattern is pressed on to the outer side of cone 2. The cooling core 5 shown in Yig.2 comprises a channel 7 for a conventional cooling liquid which can keep the cooling core at any desired suitable temperature. A second channel system 8 serves for the introduction of an edible fatty mixture which impregnates the inside of the cone. The fat is pressed through a large number of openings 9 into the inside of cone 2 and stiffens here as cone 2 cools. The surface temperature of the cooling cone 5, the stiffening temperature of the fatty mixture and the temperature of the hot wafer placed in cooling mould halves 3 and 4 can be adjusted with respect to each other. The cooling mould halves 3 and 4 are provided with channels 10 for coolant. In the operation of an arrangement as shown for example in Big.2, moulded wafer cones are transferred to the coo7nr mould arrangement shown from baking moulds in which they have been baked to obtain a light, porous structure. These baking moulds can be of conventional form and in themsellres constitute no part of this invention. The wall thickness of the wafers as initially baked in the baking moulds can be, for example, in the range about 2 3 mm, e.g. about 2.5 mm to 2.6 mm.The wafers can be baked from a dough or batter containing conventional dough ingredients e.g. flour, sugar, water, and further additives in which the uncooked dry components form, for example, about 50 60 w v, e.g. about 55 w v. The weight of the baked cone can be, for example, about 35 50 of the weight of the dough dosed into the mould.The rising properties of the dough can be adjusted e.g. wtr bicarbonate so that, when the dough dosed into the mould corresponds to the free volume between the mould parts, tb er is a loss bg overflow during baking of, for example, about 5 15 of the quantity of dough dosed into the mould. In this way, for example, the light, porous structure can be produced. Suitable baking temperatures are, for example, in the range about 180 210 C, e.g. for dough with sugar contents about 35 45 . The light porous cone so produced can be transferred to the cooling mould by conventional mechanical transport arrangements that in themselves form no part of this invention.We have found that the light, porous cones may remain sufficiently hot and soft for compression in the cooling moulds for a period of time after extraction from the baking mould or otherwise after cessation of baking for a period of time of for example 0.1 to 0.4 minutes the higher the sugar content, the longer the cones remain hot and soft. Suitable temperatures for the cooling moulds are, for example, in the range 155 160 C most preferably the lower the temperature, the higher the sugar content of te cones . In the cooling moulds, the wall thicknesses of the cones can, for example, be compressed to about 50 85 e.g. 50 70 of their original thickness, or the desired final consstency. Pig.3 shows a second yes lye oQ 3. 1 Igtfy baked hollow wafer 11, which can be open into a waster beaker 12 as shown in Fig.4, in a cooling mould not shown, but corresponding in functional arrangement to that shown in Figure 2. It can be seen that variously shaped wafer beaRers can be formed from cooling remoulding of the simple rotation the symmetrical shape of the hollow wafer 11. For example, the final product can be given an oval or polygonal cross section and any of various heights, by using correspondingly shaped cooling moulds.
