# Apparatus for dispensing viscous substances such as pastes or creams.

## Abstract
An apparatus for dispensing viscous pastes, creams and the like substances 12 that are not free flowing under grav ity comprises a container 10 and a charge dispensing pump 120 at the bottom thereof. The pump comprises a cylinder 122 and a piston 130 consisting of an inner member 132 and an outer member 134 . The piston 130 is reciprocated by a piston rod 126 . In non operated position, stem 133 of inner piston member 132 closes and seals a dispensing nozzle 146 at the outer end of the piston rod. When the piston rod is actuated downwardly, the nozzle 146 moves away from the stem 133 until shoulders 152 on the piston rod engage fins 148 on the stem and pull the inner piston member 132 down until it seats on the top of outer piston member 134 closing apertures 33 therein. Substance 12 is then expelled by piston 130 from cylinder 22 through outlet port 129 between the top of the piston rod and the inner member 132 , the annular passage 152 through the piston and nozzle 146 . When after dispensing the contents of the cylinder the piston rod is actuated upwardly nozzle 146 moves onto stem 133 and is thereby sealed, and port 129 closes. The inner piston member 132 is then lifted through outer piston member 134 , opening apertures 33. A rib 27 on inner member 132 then entrains the outer member 134 and the piston 130 moves back to its non operated position causing a vacuum in cylinder 122 which thus refills with substance 12 through apertures 33 .

## Description
DISPENSING VISCOUS SUBSTANCES. This invention relates to apparatus for dispensing viscous pastes, creams and other substances and in particular substances of a high viscosity such that they are not free flowing under gravity, which comprises a container for holding a quantity of substance to be dispensed, a charge dispensing pump at one end of the container, the pump comprising a cylinder, a piston reciprocable in the cylinder, a piston rod and exteriorly operable means for actuating the piston rod through a dispensing stroke and a return stroke. Most pump type dispensing apparatus for dispensing fluid substances depend for their operation on the substance being dispensed being sufficiently free flowing under gravity so as to flow freely into and refill the pumping chamber after a delivery stroke. Viscous pastes, creams and other substances which are not free flowing under gravity cannot be dispensed by apparatus of this type wherein the flow of substance under gravity is relied on to refill the pumping chamber. The invention as claimed is characterised in that the piston rod is hollow, a delivery nozzle is arranged at the outer end of the piston rod, the piston is carried at the inner end of the piston rod and comprises a first member having a periphery spaced from the cylinder side wall and a second member contacting the cyl nder side wall and slidably mounted on the first member for relative movement axially between a first position in which the first member closes at least one aperture provided in the second member for passage therethrough of substance from the container into the cylinder and opens at least one outlet port in the piston rod, and a second position in which the said at least one aperture is open for passage of substance and the said at least one outlet port is closed, and means for closing the delivery nozzle at the conclusion of the dispensing stroke. The contact between the second piston member and the cylinder side wall is such that frictional drag and the inertia of the substance with which the second member is in contact causes a switch over from one of the first and second positions to the other on reversal of the direction of reciprocating movement of the piston rod. Separate inlet and outlet valves associated with the piston are not required in this construction, the function of such valves being performed by the slidable second piston member movable between its first and second positions. The invention may be carried out by the apparatus illustrated by way of example in the accompanying diagrammatic drawings, in which Figure 1 is a diagrammatic longitudinal section through one form of the apparatus Figures 2 to 6 are enlarged sectional views of the lower end of the container and the primp at respectively different stages in the operating cycle Figure 7 is an enlarged perspective view of the pump piston and piston rod Figure 8 is a similar perspective view of a member incorporating a delivery nozzle Figure 9 is a plan view of the member shown in Figure 8 Figure 10 is a diagrammatic, exploded perspective view of the apparatus, partly broken away, showing the assembly thereof Figure 11 is a diagrammatic longitudinal section through a preferred form of dispensing pump Figures 12 to 15 show the dispensing pump of Figure Uat respectively different stages in the operating cycle. Referring to Figure 1, the apparatus shown comprises a parallel sided container 10 for holding a supply of substance 12 to be dispensed. The container 10 is arranged to be mounted in an upright position by means not shown to a wall or other vertical surface. The container 10 has a bottom wall 14 which incorporates a charge dispensing pump 20.The substance 12 to be dispensed has such a viscosity that it does not flow freely under gravity and a follower 16 in the form of a free piston is provided on top of the substance the tongs ear 10 to prevent the substance drying uzt The foii ,wer 16 also scrapes sub stance off the wall of the container and ensures a feed of substance into the pump 20 for dispensing by preventing the creation of air voids in the container as substance is w.wthdrawn by the pump as described below. The container is closed by a lid 17 which provides an air vent. The charge dispensing pump 20 comprises a cylinder 22 which in the embodiment being described is integral with the bottom wall 14 of the container.10. The upper end of the cylinder 22 opens directly into the interior of the container 10 and its lower end carries a guide 24 in which a tubular piston rod 26 is axially slidably mounted. The piston rod 26 sealingly engages the guide 24 to prevent the passage of substance 12 and air between the exterior of the rod and the guide. The upper end of the piston rod 26 carries a piston 30. The piston 30 comprises an inner member 32 and an outer member 34. The inner member 32 is in the form of a solid, circular piston of a diameter substantially less than that of the cylinder 22 and is integral with the piston rod 26. The outer member 34 is annular and comprises a central hub 36 connected by arms 37 to an outer rim 38, seeFigure 7,. The outer member 34 is slidably mounted on the inner member 32. An annular rib 27 on the inner member 22 limits sliding movement of the outer piston member 34 in a direction away from. the inner member 32 by engaging an annular rib 39 on the inside of the hub 36. Below the rib 27 the wall of the piston rod 26 is pierced by one or more outlet ports 29.The axial height of the hub 36 is such that when the rib 39 on the hub 36 is in abutting engagement with the rib 27 the hub 36 closes the ports 29.Sliding movement of the outer piston member 34 in the opposite direction is limited by engagement of the member 34 with the underside of the solid, inner member 32. The inner diameter of the rim 38 is slightly less than the diameter of the inner member 32, the spokes 37 thus defining a region of the outer member 34 which has apertures 33 to permit the substance to be pumped to pass from one side of outer member 34 to the other. Such passage of substance is prevented when the members 32 and 34 are mutually engaged. The outer diameter of the buter piston member 34 is such that the side wall of the cylinder 22 exerts a frictional drag on the piston member for purposes to be explained. A combined operating member and nozzle member 40 is mounted on the outer end 26a of the piston rod 26 for engagement with exteriorly operable means not shown for reciprocating the piston rod 26 in the guide 24. The member 40 comprises a flange 42 engageable with the exteriorly operable means and a bottom wall 44 having a plurality of arcuate slots 46 therein radially aligned with the wall of the piston rod 26 at the outer end 26a. Projections 48 are engaged in grooves 50 in the wall of the piston rod so that the member 40 is free to move axially of the piston rod by a small distance such as 3 mm. The operation of the apparatus will now be described. At the commencement of a dispensing stroke, the parts of the pump 20 have the relative positions shown in Figure 2. The member 40 is lifted so that the slots 46 are closed by the end 26a of the piston rod 26 thus creating a seal which prevents air from entering the pump. The exteriorly operable means engaged with the flange 42 are operated to draw the piston rod 26 downwardly. Member 40 is moved down to the bottom of the grooves 50 which break the seal and opens the slots 46. The piston rod 26 then moves down, outer member 34 initially being held stationary by friction with the wall of the cylinder and the inertia of the substance 12 filling the cylinder 22.When the inner piston member 32 engages the outer member 34 as shown in Figure 3 it closes the apertures 33 in the outer member 34 thus trapping a quantity of the substance 12 to be dispensed in the cylinder 22 beneath the piston.In this relative position of the piston members the hub 36 does not obstruct the ports 29 in the piston rod 26. Continued downwards movement of the piston rod 26 draws the piston 30 through the cylinder both piston members 32 and 34 moving together as a unit and expels the substance 12 from the cylinder through the ports 29 and the bore of the piston rod, see Figure 4. The substance is dispensed through the slots 46 of the nozzle member 40. If the dispensing stroke is continued until the piston 30 bottoms in the cylinder 22, Figure 5, a maximum quantity of substance is dispensed. Means not shown may be provided for varying the length of the dispensing stroke for selecting the quantity of substance dispensed as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. During the above downwards movement of the piston 30 substance 12 from within the container 10 is sucked down into the cylinder 22 above the piston.When at the conclusion of the dispensing stroke, the action of the exteriorly operable means is reversed and initially the member 40 is lifted on the piston rod 26 to close the slots 46 and reestablish the seal. Once the seal is established the piston rod 26 is returned upwardly the rod first sliding through the outer piston member 34 which stays down until the ribs 27 and 39 engage and the hub 36 closes the ports 29, Figure 6. Air is thus prevented from entering the cylinder 22 from the exterior causing a vacuum in the cylinder, and as the piston completes its return stroke substance 12 from the container is sucked through the apertures 33 in the outer member 34, which are now uncovered, and refills the cylinder 22 beneath the piston in readiness for the next dispensing stroke, Figure 2. The cycle can be repeated as desired. The apparatus of Figure 1 can be assembled nrn the V y s1 irple manner illustrated in Figure 10 First the piston member 34 is pressed onto the piston rod 26 and the asse bled parts are inserted into the container 10 which is moulded to include the cylinder 22. Then the member 40 is snapped onto the end of the piston rod 26 from beneath. After filling the container, the follower 16 is inserted and the lid 17 put on. Figures 11 to 15 illustrate another embodiment of apparatus comprising a modified pump 120, the construction and operation of which is similar to that of the pump 20 so that only the differences will be pointed out in the following. Pump 120 comprises a pumping chamber 122 having an external annular flange 121 formed with an inwardly directed rib 123 which is engaged behind an annular rib 111 formed around the mouth of a blow moulded container 11Q, Piston 130 comprises an inner member 132 having a solid head and a depending stem 133 which extends axially within the piston rod 126 and defines an annular passageway 152 therewith. Flange 142 on the piston rod 126 is engageable with the exteriorly operable means not shown . The inner member 132 is free to move axially of the piston rod 126 a small distance such as 3 mm.Figure 11 shows the piston rod in an upper position relative to the member 132 defined by the upper end of the piston rod contacting the underside of the head of the member 132. The lower end of the piston rod 126 is formed as a dispensing nozzle 146. In such upper position of the piston rod relative to the inner piston member 132, the stem 133 projects into the nozzle and closes it thus creating a sei which prevents air from entering the pump. Two dlametrically opposed fins 148 on the stem 133 project into the passageway 152 adjacent the nozzle 146. Shoulders 150 are provided on the inside wall of the piston rod 126 to co operate with the fins 148 as follows. At the commencement of a delivery stroke the parts of the pump are in the position shown in Figure 11, the piston rod 126 being in its upper position. The exteriorly operable means engaged with the flange 142 are operated to draw te piston rod downwardly. The piston rod 126 moves down relative to the inner piston member 132 through the small distance mentioned so that nozzle 146 opens, Figure 12. Then the shoulders 150 engage the fins 146, and the piston rod 126 then entrains the inner piston member 132 so that parts 126 132 move downwardly as a unit during the remainder of the delivery stroke. At the time the shoulders 150 engage the fins 148, the upper end of the piston rod has moved down away from the underside of the head of the inner piston member 132, the annular gap thus opened up defining the outlet port 129 communicating with the passageway 152. The port 129 is closed at this moment by the hub 136 of the outer piston member 134. The outer pistor member 134 remains stationary until entrained by the inner member 132, Figure 13, a in the case of the previous embodiment, and during s time the hub 136 has moved sufficiently to open the port 129. Substance is then dispensed through nozzle 146 for the remainder of the dispensing stroke,Figure 14. At the end of the dispensing stroke, Figure 15, the action of the exteriorly operable means is reversed. The piston rod 126 moves upwardly relative to the inner piston member 132 until it engages the underside of the head thereof at a position within hub 136. The outlet port 129 is thereby closed. The nozzle 146 is also closed. Thereafter the continuing upward movement of the piston rod 126 lifts the inner piston member 132 until the latter entrains the outer piston member 134 as shown inFigure 15, whereafter the movement continues until the parts return to the positions shown in Figure 11 and the cylinder refills in readiness for the next dispensing stroke in the manner described for the first embodiment. The outer piston member 134 is retained in the pump by a plurality of circumerentially spaced resilient fingers 154 which depend from the hub 136 and in the upper position of the outer piston member engage a rib 156 within the chamber 122 to prevent further displacement of the piston member.It will be understood that the fingers 154 do not obstruct flow of substance into the port 129. The presence of the follower 16 on top of the supply of substance in a rigid container 10 ensures that as substance is withdrawn from the container 10 by operation of the pump the substance in the container is drawn along towards the pump by the vacuum created during operation of the pump. The apparatus can therefore be operated it positions other than the vertical position described. If the wall of the container 10 is transparent or translucent, or includes a transparent panel, such that the position of the follower 16 can be viewed from outside the container, the follower can be used as a level indicator. The follower 16 is not required if the container 10 is collapsible and is unvented. The entire apparatus as described may be manufactured very simply and cheaply by moulding in suitable plastics materials. Other possibilities for manufacturing the container include injection moulding, or forming the container from an extruded tube to which an end cap bearing the pump is attached.
