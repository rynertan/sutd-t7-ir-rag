# Method for producing master alloys.

## Abstract
A method for the production of master alloys of an alkali metal such as lithium and a second metal such as aiuminium or an aluminum alloy is disclosed in which the second metal, in the form of a mechanically alloyed powder, is exposed to molten alkali metal. The method may be carried out in the presence of a liquid medium or in an inert gas medium.
