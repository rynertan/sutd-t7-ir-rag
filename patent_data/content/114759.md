## Abstract
An amino acid sequence or a synthetic polypeptide consisting of the same and preferably containing a helical structure is capable of being recognised by two or more antisera raised against different viral strains by virtue of the rotationally and translationally related different aspects presented by the helix to the antibodies. In particular, amino acid sequences of this invention may have rotationally related epitopic sites recognisable by different strains of foot and mouth disease virus.

## Description
AMINO ACID SEQUENCES AND POLYPEPTIDES INCLUDING THESE SEOUENCES AND HAVING THE SPECIFICITY OF FOOT AND MOUTHDISEASE AND OTHER VIRAL ANTIGENS. This invention relates to amino acid sequences, to polypeptides consisting of the same and to processes for producing these sequences and polypeptides, which have the specificity of two or more antigens of certain viruses and, in particular, of foot and mouth disease viral antigens. The natural immune system is based upon the well known antigen antibody reaction, in which an antigen which is foreign to the host body an example is a virus stimulates the production by the host of antibodies specific to the antigen. These antigenspecific antibodies react with the antigen and. in a manner which is still being investigated, neutralize it. The antibodies so biosynthesized recognize specific surface features of the molecular structure of the antigen. Antibodies to proteins and polypeptides can be conveniently classified into conformational and sequential types, according to whether they recognise the relatively static conformation of an antigenic determinant region, or an inherently more flexible sequence of amino acid residues. Most short. free pQlypeptides tend to lack any secondary structure sufficient to give a relatively static surface to form an antigenic determinant of the conformational type.However, in certain polypeptides where the amino acid residues have collectively sufficient helix forming potential, the polypeptide can adopt a rigid helical structure in which the movement of the side chains of the amino acid residues is relatively spatially restricted. In this situation a specific antibody able to recognise the polypeptide would only be expected to do so when the helix was in the correct position with respect to the combining site of the antibody, that is, in a position such that those residues along the helix surface which collectively have the correct topology and charge distribution to form the antigenic determinant site are complementary to the combining site of the antibody. Expressed in geometrical terms, combination only occurs at the correct rotation about and translation along the helix axis with respect to the antibody. Most viruses comprise a core of genetic material surrounded by a coat of protein or the like and it is this coat or. more precisely. specific regions of the molecular structure of this coat that antibodies recognize and neutralize. It is clear that an immune response to a given virus could be induced by injecting into the host a protein corresponding to the native coat protein or even a compound whose surface structure is or includes a section which is essentially the same as the antigenic determinant regions of that coat protein.Where an amino acid sequence forming part of the coat protein has adopted a helical configuration, some of the side chains on the amino acids making up that sequence will be directed into the interior of the protein as part of the hydrophobic core. It is only those side chains which are directed outwards and which are accessible to solvent that can be recognized by an antibody and are thus of importance when designing a synthetic compound to induce the same antigenic response. Synthetic compounds of this type have the potential to be of considerable value, especially where disease control is currently by means of killed or attenuated virus vaccines, which can be potentially dangerous.However, most viruses exist as a number of strains and a vaccine effective against one strain may be ineffective or insufficiently effective against another.Accordingly, it would be necessary to manufacture separate compounds for each strain of the virus. EP 44710 discloses a possible solution to this problem by linking together in a single chain, which may be helical, two or more small peptide units, each unit containing a single antigenic determinant region. Foot and mouth disease FMD , also known as hoof and mouth disease, is a problem of major economic importance in many countries. Control of the disease is primarily with killed virus vaccines. A major problem with the production and application of the vaccine is the extreme variation found in the antigenic determinants on the FMD virus FMDV particle responsible for eliciting an immune response. Thus, FMDV exists as seven serotypes comprising more than 60 strains. Immunity to one serotype does not confer protection against the other six. Furthermore, control of the disease by vaccination is complicated by the extreme antigenic lability of the virus even within serotypes. The extent of this variation is such that vaccination will not necessarily give prolonged protection against other strains of the virus even within the same serotype. The antigenic variation between the serotypes is due to variation in the amino acid sequence of the VP1 capsid protein which is the major coat protein of FMDV and which carries the major immunogenic portion of the coat , giving rise to structural variations in the sites epitopes which combine with antibodies.Similar problems exist with many other viruses, for example, the polio virus, or the viruses of influenza, hepatitis, viral hog cholera, rabies. smallpox, measles, rubella or mumps. Two antigenic sites within VP1 have been recognised. The first is around residues 138 154 and the second is from 200 to the C terminal. The second is probably a sequential type of determinant, but the first is conformational , and hence more suited for secondary and tertiary structure analysis. In this specification. as is conventional in the art, an amino acid position in a given sequence is assigned a number equating to the number of amino acid residues in the sequence. counting from the N terminal to that position. In considering synthetic sequences analogous to a natural polypeptide or to part of a natural polypeptide, it is generally convenient to base the numbering system on the natural polypeptide and to use that system for numbering the synthetic sequence. even though the synthetic sequence may be different from the natural sequence.Such differences may be of three types a an amino acid at position x of the natural sequence may not be present in the synthetic sequence this is referred to as a deletion at position x b an amino acid present in the synthetic sequence may not have a counterpart in the natural sequence this is referred to as an insertion between positions x and x 1 of the natural sequence and c an amino acid at position x of the natural sequence may be replaced by a different amino acid this is referred to as a substitution at positionIn the case of the VP1 protein of FMDV, the numbering is based upon a sequence identical to that of the VP1 protein of the O1K virus type, except that the O1K sequence has a deletion at position 199. I have now discovered that it is possible to include 2 or more antigenic determinant regions on a single small polypeptide molecule, which may be helical, by arranging that the two or more regions are, in part or in whole, occupying the same parts of the molecule, e.g.the same turns of the helix. The amino acid sequence carrying those regions can be relatively small, e.g.from 7 to 30, more preferably from 10 to 20 and most preferably from 15 to 17. amino acid units long. In the present invention, the sequence of amino acids which gives rise to one antigenic site is at least partially interpolated with other amino acids so that the conformation of the molecule provides at least two antigenic sites in which the amino acids of each site are conformationally contiguous, and said other amino acids forming at least part of one antigenic site. Thus. the present invention consists in a molecule comprising an amino acid sequence having at least two antigenic regions, each said region being capable of being recognized by antibodies raised against a viral protein sequence, each said region being formed of a chain of amino acids of said sequence, the chains forming said regions having at least one amino acid preferably more than one amino acid of said sequence in common, so that the chains at least partly overlap and are not contiguous along the length of the molecule. The sequence is preferably such that it adopts a helical conformation, however, other conformations are possible, for example other sequences may form a structure similar to a B sheet. The degree of overlap between the two or more antigenic regions and, hence, the chains forming them may vary considerably. Substantial overlap between the regions is clearly desirable, in order that the sequence may be as short as possible thereby facilitating synthesis. For example, overlap such that at least 25 of the amino acids in one of said chains also form part of the other of said chains is preferred. An overlap of at least 50S is more preferred and a greater degree of overlap. e.g. at least 75 , may be aimed for, if possible. In some cases, it may be possible to achieve or, at least, approach 100 overlap. The molecule of the invention is preferably a polypeptide. The sequence of the invention is preferably coupled to a larger compound to form a single molecule, in order to facilitate antibody response, as is well known.Examples of such larger compounds include keyhole limpet haemocyamin, bovine serum albumin, btg, ss galactosidase or penicillinase. The sequence of the invention may be covalently attached to the molecule of the larger compound or, especially where it and the larger compound are constructed together by recombinant DNA technology, the sequence of the invention may be linked in some other manner to the larger compound, for example, where the larger compound is a polypeptide such as ss galactosidase or penicillinase, it may be interposed in the amino acid chain of that compound. The molecules disclosed herein are characterised by having the specificity of two or more viral antigers, especially foot and mouth disease viral FMDV antigens. As will be apparent from the disclosure to follow, the polypeptides. recombinant DNA molecules, and processes of this invention may be used in the production of antigenic polypeptides useful in diagnostic methods and in compositions for rer3ering animals resistant to FMDV for some period of time. Secondary structure analysis of the amino acid sequence of VP1 protein of FMDV type O1K by the method of. for example, Chou and Fasman Adv. Enzym. 47, 45 148 1978 shows that a large part 144 160 of this sequence is helical, and furthermore that the corresponding sequence in the VP1 protein of FMDV typeC3, which contains several amino acid substitutions compared to O1K, is also helical. These sequences can also be analysed to see which groups are contiguous with the hydrophobic core of the VP1 protein. The basis of this method and the rules for one amino acid have been published lNicholson, Biochem. Soc.Trans., 10. 387 1982 . The method is based on the detailed analysis of the side chain contacts of 24 proteins whose tertiary structure has been determined by X ray crystallography, and the position of a particular residue with respect to the hydrophobic core of the protein correlated with the sequence of residues adjacent to it in the primary sequence, it being known that in nature the primary sequence determines the secondary and tertiary structure. In FMDV type 01K, all the residues in the core are on one side of the helix, except for Val 150, which would require a proximal side chain from elsewhere in the molecule to satisfy the core definition. A noticeable feature of the FMDV type 01K helix is the series of four polar side chains forming a band down one side which must be just above the surface of the contiguous protein, since the helix residues adjacent to the polar band residues are in the interior core of the rest of the protein. The amino acid substitutions in the corresponding sequences of the different strains are shown in Table 1 TABLE 1 Epicylin P O1K C3 O1K A10 A24 C3 144 Arg LEU Arg Arg Arg 5 Arg Arg Ser Arg Arg 6 Gly Gly Gly Gly Gly 7 Asp Asp Asp Asp Asp 8 Leu Leu Leu MET Leu 9 Gln Gln Clv Gly ALA 150 Thr VAL Ser Thr His 1 Leu Leu Leu Leu Leu 2 Ala Ala Ala Ala Ala 3 Gln Gln ALA ALA ALA 4 Lys Lys Arg Arg Ala 5 His VAL VAL VAL His 6 Ala Ala Ala VAL Ala 7 Arg Arg Thr Lys Arg 8 His Thr Gln Gln His 9 Leu Leu Leu Leu Leu In the above table and throughout this specification, the amino acids are identified by the internationally recognized standard three letter amino acid code.The amino acids are underlined where they differ from those of Epicylin P O1K C3 which is a sequence in accordance with the present invention and are in capitals where they are predicted to be in the protein core. Their effect is as follows. In FMDV type C3, theGln at 149 and 153 of O1K are replaced by Ala. both of which are now predicted to be in the core Lys 154 is replaced by Ala non core and some basicity is regenerated by the appearance of three His for two Val 150, 155 and Thr 158. Thus in FMDV type C3, and to some extent in types A10 and A24, the bulky polar side chains of the left hand side have been replaced by small hydrophobic side chains which are in the core and at the same time the right hand side has the two core Val replaced by non core His. Effectively therefore, in the intact protein VP1 the helix viewed from the N terminal has rotated anticlockwise with respect to the core, presenting a different topology for the constant features relative to the antibody binding sites, in addition to the substitutions themselves. The rotation may well be assisted by the deletion in the 140 145 range, which might explain why these residues appear to be involved in the antigenic response. Thus the antibody combining sites of the two epitopes are related by rotation about the helix axis. The present invention utilises this discovery in developing synthetic polypeptides of appropriate amino acid sequence such that they form rotationally related epitopes which may interact with antibodies raised against different strains of virus and on coupling to suitable carrier proteins of natural or synthetic protein conventionally used for preparing antigens e.g.bovine serum albumin. induce antibody formation. Also in Table 1, under the heading Epicylin P O1K C3 , is shown an amino acid sequence in accordance with this invention and this has been found to elicit antibodies which neutralize virus type C3, as well as virus type O1K, from which its structure is derived. The amino acid sequence produced comprised the amino acid residues labelled 144 159. It was synthesized by recombinant DNA technology by inserting a genetic sequence corresponding to the desired amino acid sequence between the EcoRl and BamHl sites of a ss galactosidase gene in a modified plasmid vector derived from pBR322 according to conventional methodology. and as illustrated subsequently in theExample. Another amino acid sequence. Epicylin AP A10 A12, was produced by chemical synthesis by inserting arginine between positions 145 and 146 of a sequence corresponding to that of the VP1 protein of virus typeA10. The method employed was that of Bittle et al. Nature 298, p 30 33 1982 . The structure of thisEpicylin AP A10 A12 is shown in Table 2, together. for comparison, with the corresponding sequences of VP1 protein of FMDV types A10, A12A and A12B.

The results are shown in Table 3. which shows the effectiveness of antibodies elicited by each of the amino acid sequences shown in Table 2 against viruses of types A10. A12A and A12B.

It may also be applied to such other viruses as those of influenza. hepatitis, viral hog cholera.rabies. measles, rubella. mumps or should it ever again become a problem smallpox. Polypeptides or other compounds comprising the amino acid sequences of the invention may be formulated in a conventional manner with carriers or adjuvants and are preferably formulated for injection, although other routes of administration are possible. A further advantage of the invention in common with all synthetic polypeptide vaccines is that contamination with potentially infective material is avoided. Another advantage is that. it is relatively easy to clone a synthetic DNA sequence corresponding to the amino acid sequence of the invention into a vector such as pBR322. since this plasmid readily accepts short lengths of DNA. and growth in E.coli HB101 or similar would allow expression of the polypeptide, which could be further enhanced by inclusion of promoters in the DNA sequence and other published procedures. Since the polypeptide is small. and helical structures may readily be disrupted and reformed in vitro. spontaneous formation of the helical secondary structure is assured. The polypeptide can be prepared according to any conventional method of synthesising peptides. Either solid phase processes or liquid phase processes may be employed, with the latter being advantageous in many cases. Such processes for synthesising peptides are described in. for example. The Peptides , vol. 1 1966 written by Schroder and Luhke Academic Press, New York,U.S.A. or Peptide Synthesis written by Izumiya et al., Maruzen Co. Ltd. 1975 , and there are illustrated, for example. an azide process, a chloride process, an acid anhydride process, a mixed acid anhydride process, a DCC process, an active ester process, a process usingWoodward reagent K, a carbodiimidazole process. an oxidation reduction process. a DCC additive e.g. HONB, HOBt, HOSu, etc. process, and the like. In particular, the polypeptide or its amino acid sequence can easily be synthesised by conventional processes for synthesising polypeptides, especially the so called stepwise process in which amino acids are condensed one by one onto a terminal amino acid. or by a process of coupling several fragments. More specifically, the above described peptide can be prepared by condensing a reactive carboxyl groupcontaining starting material corresponding to one of the two fragments formed by separating the peptide at an arbitrary bond position with another reactive amino group containing starting material corresponding to the other fragment in a manner conventionally employed for the synthesis of peptides and, where the resulting condensate contains a protective group or groups.removing the protective group s in a conventional manner. The synthetic peptides of this invention may be used for treatment. prevention or diagnosis of viral infections of mammals including man. Vaccines of the peptides may be formulated and used in a conventional manner see for example European Patent Publication No. O 090 581 and U.K. Patent Specification No. 1 083 815 . Advantageously. the peptides are administered sub cutaneously or intramuscularly at doses of between 1 to 100 microgram per kilogram body weight of the mammal, preferably from 10 to 50 microgram kilogram. Maximum protection is likely to be afforded by a plurality of administered doses spaced from 2 to 8 weeks apart. The invention is illustrated by the followingExample, which should not be construed as a limitation thereof. and which illustrates the preparation ofEpicylin P 01K C3. EXAMPLE 1. Construction of Plasmid PXY413 The methods used for plasmid construction and analysis are described by Maniatis et al. MolecularCloning, A laboratory manual, Cold Spring HarborLaboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York 1982 . Techniques useful for the analysis of ss galactosidase are described by J. Miller Experiments in molecular genetics, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Cold SpringHarbor. New York 1972 . Plasmid pXY413, an open reading frame vector, was constructed as shown in Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings. The three starting plasmids were pEA300 obtained from Dr. Egon Aman Harvard University,Cambridge MA, .S.A. , pMC1403 M. Casadaban et al., J.Bact. 143, 971 1980 . and pOP203 13 obtained from Dr.F. Fuller Harvard University. Cambridge MA, U.S.A. The lac genetic elements of plasmid pOP203 13 were recloned from the original pBR322 replicon onto a pAT153 replicon and renamed pXYl. This plasmid contains the lac promoter and operator elements and the first eight amino acids of 13 galactosidase. The 35 region of the trp promoter was provided by pEA300 and the hybrid tac promoter pXY620 was constructed as shown in Figure 1A. To enhance its usefulness in subsequent plasmid constructions, the tac promoter and associated eight amino acids of 13 galactosidase were recloned onto pXY621 and subsequently pXY623 as shown in Figure 1B. The plasmid pXY623 was then cut with PstI and EcoRI and separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. A 1000 base pair piece of DNA was isolated which contained the tac promoter ribosome binding site and start cod on.This was ligated into plasmid pMC1403 which had also been cut with PstI and EcoRI. The resulting plasmid pXY413 contained the tac promoter and ribosome binding site. eight amino acids of 13 galactosidase, a polylinker region, the enzymatically active carboy terminal 1015 amino acids of ss galactosidase. and a ss lactamase gene and origin of replication for plasmid selection and maintenance Fig. 1C . Plasmid pXY413 does not direct the production of large quantities of ss galactosidase under tac promoter control as the ribosomes which initiate translation at the ATG codon immediately downstream of the ribosome binding site are not in the same reading frame as the structural gene for ss galactosidase. When plasmid pXY413 is transformed into a lac Z host such as JM103 or JM105 the colonies are white on X gal indicator plates indicating little or no ss galactosidase activity is present. As a test system for expression, the BamHI site of pXY413 was filled in with DNA poll Klenow fragment to adjust the reading frame and allow ss galactosidase production from the tac promoter. An example of such a construction, pXY415. when transformed into JM10 produces large amounts of ss galactosidase and gives blue colonies on X gÅal plates. This is an important feature of pXY413 in that desired recombinants may be easily selected for by identifying blue colonies on 2 gal indicator plates. 2. Construction of Plasmid pWRL240 A synthetic gene coding for a hybrid FMDV VP1 antigenic determinant serotypes Ol and C3 this is the material which I have named Epicylin P O1K C3 was assembled from six oligonucleotides. N1 N6 Figure 2 , cloned into pUC9 Figure 4 . After confirming that the resulting plasmid pWRL220 contained the desired sequence Figure 3 . the synthetic gene was removed by cutting the plasmid with EcoRI and BamHI and ligating the resulting 68 base pair fragment into the open reading frame vector pXY413 to construct plasmid pWRL240 as shown in Figure 5.3. Expression and antiqenic activity of hybrid protein When transformed into JM105. pWRL240 directed the synthesis of high levels of a hybrid ss galactosidase gene and gave blue colonies on X gal indicator plates. The hybrid protein has 19 amino acids of VP1 fused to the amino terminus of ss galactosidase Figure 6 . The hybrid protein produced by pWRL240 had the same specific activity as normal 13 galactosidase and can be purified by standard techniques Miller, op. cit. or affinity chromatography with antibodies to 13 galactosidase. Small amounts of the hybrid protein were purified by affinity chromatography and injected into Guinea Pigs together with adjuvant for testing of immunogenic activity.
