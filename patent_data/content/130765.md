# FLARED VANE FOR ABRASIVE BLASTING WHEEL

## Abstract
An abrasive wheel assembly comprising a rotor 12 , a runnerhead 13 concentricaliy mounted on the said rotor for rotation at a predetermined operating RPM, a plurality of spaced radially arranged abrasive particle throwing vanes 14 , means detachably securing the said vanes to the face of the said runnerhead, impeller means 18 carried by the said rotor for feeding particulate abrasive material to the said vanes, characterised in that said vanes are provided with an abrasive throwing face 15 having space side portions 29, 30 flared away from the abrasive receiving heel end portion 16 of the said vane to the discharge end thereof 17 at a flare angle in the range of from 2 to 7 is disclosed. An abrasive particle throwing vane for use in a rotatabie blasting wheel assembly, the said vane comprising a heel end portion spaced from a discharge end portion, a particle throw ing face surface intermediate the said end portions, character ised in that the spaced sides of the said face flare away from the said heel end portion to the said discharge end of the said throwing face at a flare angle in the range of from 2 to 7 is also disclosed. By virtue of the present invention, inter alia, it is now pos sible to effect even distribution of abrasive transverse of the vane face at a varying operating rate.
