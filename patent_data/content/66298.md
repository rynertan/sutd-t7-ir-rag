# SF6 GAS INSULATING ELECTRIC APPARATUS AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCING THE SAME

## Abstract
A SF₆ gas insulating electric apparatus usable as a circuit breaker, etc., containing a SF₆ gas insulator and a resin insulator, both of which insulators are present in an atmos phere to be exposed to arcs, characterized by making at least the surface portion to be exposed to arcs of the resin insulator from a polymer containing nitrogen atoms or a polyolefin resin, and if necessary together with an inorganic filler powder, is excellent in both surface and inner arc resistance and can maintain breaking performance for a long period of time.
