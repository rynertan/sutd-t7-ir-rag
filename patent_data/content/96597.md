# HIGH EFFICIENCY PARTICULATE AIR FILTER AND METHOD OF FABRICATING SAME

## Abstract
A high efficiency particulate air filter 20 is provided which is of lightweight and readily disposable after use. Furthermore, this filter may be fabricated in a basic or universal form, which permits it to be utilized to form any one of a number of possible specific mounting configura tions by the placement of one or more specifically designed headers about its outer periphery. The filter 20 comprises a sheet of filtering media folded upon itself in accordion fashion to form a filter pack 22 , and a relatively thin and lightweight peripheral frame 32 surrounding and support ing the pack. The frame is composed of a relatively hard, crust like, air impermeable molded material which is self bonded and sealed to the filter pack effectively to preclude the leakage of air therebetween. Internal integral reinforcing ribs are formed in the material of the frame along at least two opposite sides of the pack, to provide sufficient strength to permit the filter to be mounted against a pressure seal or the like.
