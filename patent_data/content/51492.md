# Method of making heat transfer coil.

## Abstract
A method of making a heat transfer coil by placing pieces of heat conductve tubing in juxtaposition with each other and deforming the pieces of tubing in a controlled manner while maintaining the pieces of tubing in juxtaposition to selectively adlust the cross sectional size of the fluid passages through the pieces of tubing and to cause the areas of contact between the pieces of tubing to be increased to enhance the heat transfer rate between the working fluids passing through the fluid passages in the tubing. The pieces of tubing are placed in juxtaposition by winding the pieces of tubing helically around a winding mandrel to form juxtaposed coils and the size of the passages through the pieces of tubing are adjusted by internally pressurizing the tubing.
