# Detergent composition with reduced soil redeposition effect.

## Abstract
The soil redeposition effect of detergent compositions of the usual type, containing an active detergent material and a ternary mixture of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, a linear polycarboxylate and a cellulose ether can be further im proved by using as the cellulose ether a particular type of alkyl celluloses, namely those having a C₁ C₃ alkyl group, a DS of at least 0.5, a DP of not more than 300, and further being free of other substituents.
