# Surfactant compounds, their preparation and use.

## Abstract
Surfactant compounds which have a molecular structure in which a C₃ to C₃₀ alkyl radical is attached by means of a polyalkylenoxy chain to a sulphonated aromatic nucleus are used to displace oil from a formation. The compounds can be prepared by halogenating the corresponding polyoxyalkylated alkanol and reacting the product with a sulphonated aromatic compound containing a functional group attached to the aromatic nucleus.

Example 6 Preparation of 1 3 ,6 ,9 , 12 tetraoxaoctacosanoxy naphthalene sulphonic acid, sodium saltEMI6.1 1 Naphthol 12.6g, 0.09mol was added to a solution of sodium ethoxide ex 2.0g Na in ethanol 300 cm3 and stirred at room temperature for 15 minutes. To this was slowly added a 1 1 solution of the mono tosyl ester of 3,6,9,12 tetraoxaoctacosanol 47.0g, 0.08mol in ethanol, followed by boiling for 30 minutes. Removal of ethanol left a semi solid residue which was partitioned between H20 CHCl3. The organic phase was washed with IM NaOH x3 , water x3 and dried MgS04 . Removal of CHCl3 gave 45.7g of a purple liquid, identified MS as 1. To a solution of 1 20g, 0.04mol in chloroform maintained at 0 was added with vigorous stirring chlorosulphonic acid 4.4g,0.038mol . After 30 minutes, chloroform was stripped off and the residue dissolved in 1 1 H20 acetone. The pH of this solution was adjusted to 7 with NaHCC3 and solvent allowed to evaporate. Addition of a large amount of acetone gave a mixture of compounds 2 containing mainly compounds in which the sulphonate was attached to the 4 position as a colourless solid 16.8g, 0.027mol , which recrystalised as platelets from aq.acetone. NMR spectra 1H 3C were compatible with structure 2 above.

Example 7 Preparation ofEMI7.1 a C16H330 CH2CH2o 4R 0.1 mole was dissolved in dry xylene and sodium hydride 80 dispersion in oil 0.1 mole added in portions.The reaction mixture was heated to 1000C and 2 bromoethoxybenzene 0.1 mole was run in with stirring, then the mixture was stirred at 139 1400C for 5 hours. Sodium bromide was then filtered off and the product asorbed on chromatographic alumina. Elution with 1 1 ethyl acetate heptane affordsEMI7.2 in 50X yield.EMI7.3 35.3m mole was dissolved in carbon tetrachloride and concentrated sulphuric acid stirred in over 5 minutes. The reaction was exothermic 25 37 C . After standing overnight the mixture was evaporated, dissolved in water and neutralised with Ca 0H 2. The product was absorbed on silica and eluted with isopropanol water 4 1 . The sulphonate was obtained pure after recrystailising from ethanol ether. C H S Ca Br H20Found wt 59.8 9.1 6.0 3.2 0.2 0.2Theoretical wt 60.3 9.0 5.0 3.1 The compound was dissolved in Forties sea water to give a 2000 ppm solution. The interfacial tension against stabilised Forties crude oil was 6.42 x 10 2mNm 1. Example 8 A laboratory sand column composed of sand extracted from theForties Field in the North Sea was saturated with filtered sea water followed by degassed Forties crude oil and then subjected to a complete sea water flood by passing filtered sea water. Then a surfactant flood consisting of 3000 ppm solution of the compound prepared in Example 1 in filtered sea water at 700C was passed through the column. A well defined oil bank was formed and when between 1.3 and 1.9 pore volumes of the surfactant flood had been passed into the column, the oil bank containing 24Z of the residual crude oil remaining after the sea water flood was liberated from the column. One advantage of the above described surfactant is that it can be used alone in the sea water or formation water. This reduces the chromatographic separation which takes place in the reservoir. A further advantage of this surfactant is that adsorption from solution in sea water onto reservoir sand is very low, about 0.15 mg surfactant per g of sand. This reduces adsorptive losses which would take place in the reservoir. Example 9 The sand column test described in Example 8 was repeated under identical conditions with the exception that a solution of a 1 1 mole mixture of the compound prepared in Example 1 and nonylphenol ethoxylate which contained 6 molecules of ethylene oxide per molecule of nonyl phenol at a concentration of 2000 ppm was employed. The percent residual oil released was 53 and the production range 2 to 8 pore volumes.

The concentrations in Examples 9 to 11 refer to that of the sulphonate non ionic surfactant mixture. In addition to the above uses, the compounds of the present invention can be used as non built detergents.
