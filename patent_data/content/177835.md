## Abstract
An optical positional sensing apparatus for providing pre cise position and approach angle of a mobile assembly with re spect to a fixed assembly. The apparatus includes a light source and optics to produce a rotating horizontal beam. Op tics and a transducer are included which can detect the light beam when reflected back on itself. A corner reflector is af fixed to a piece of equipment to which the mobile assembly will travel. The beam is rotated by means of a drive motor. Light hit ting the corner reflector is reflected directly back under three circumstances, i.e. when the beam strikes either corner or when the beam is perpendicular to the reflector. A rotary en coder is coupled to the drive mechanism and supplies continu ous angular positional data to a microprocessor. The trans ducer is also coupled to the microprocessor which generates data sets of angular location for each transducer signal. Simple trigonometric calculations provide the desired position and ap proach angle data. An alternative embodiment includes a fixed optical assembly comprising three point light sources to re place the single, mobile assembly mounted source and fixed reflector.
