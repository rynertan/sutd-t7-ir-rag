## Abstract
An optical amplifier takes the form of a semiconductor laser with coatings on its two facets. The coating takes the form of an effect coating, e.g. an oxide of Y, Gd, Nd, or La, to reduce the reflectivity and a thin interlayer, e.g. Al₂O₃, to enhance compatibility between the laser and the effect coating.
