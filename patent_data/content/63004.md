## Description
SECONDARY GAMINES PROCESSES FOR THEIR PPEPARATION, AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM. The present invention relates to derivatives of ethanolamine which have anti obesity and or hypo glycaemic activity, to processes for their production and to their use in medicine. European Patent Application No. 79301197.4 Beechams discloses compounds of formulaEMI1.1 wherein R1 is hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, hydroxyl, hydroxymethyl, methyl, methoxy, amino, formamido, acetamido, methylsulphonamido, nitro, benzyloxy, methyl sulpbonylrnethyl, ureido, trifluoromethyl or p methoxybenzylamino R2 is hydrogen , fluorine, chlorine or hydroxyl R3 is hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine or hydroxyl 4 R4 is a carboxylic acid group or a salt, ester or amide thereof R5 is hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, dimethyl, methoxy, hydroxyl, or a carboxylic acid group or a salt, ester or amide thereof R6 is hydrogen, methyl, ethyl or propyl R7 is hydrogen, methyl, ethyl or propyl X is oxygen or a bond and Y is C16 alkylene or a bond, which possess anti obesity and or hypoglycaemic activity. It has now been discovered that a class of novel arylethanolamine derivatives have anti obesity and or hypoglycaemic activity. Accordingly, the present invention provides a compound of formula I EMI2.1 and salts thereof wherein R1 is hydrogen or methyl R2 is hydrogen or methyl R3 is hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, trifluoromethyl or C16 alkyl n is 1 or 2 X is C 1 6 straight or branched alkylene R4 is C1 6 alkoxy, hydroxy or amino optionally substituted with one or more lower alkyl groups and A is hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine or bromine. Preferably n is 1. Preferably R1 is hydrogen and R2 is methyl. X is suitably methylene, or ethylene. The R3 group may be any position on the ring, but is preferably in the meta position. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of formula I include acid addition salts formed with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, orthophosphoric acid, sulphuric acid, methane sulphonic acid, toluenesulphonic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, succinic acid, salicylic acid or acetylsalicyclic acid and, when R4 includes a carboxyl group, salts of that group such as alkali metal salts, including sodium and potassium salts, alkaline earth metal salts, including calcium and magnesium salts, and ammonium salts. The salts of compounds of formula I need not be pharmaceutically acceptable as they are also useful in the preparation of other compounds of formula I and in the separation of stereoisomers of compounds of formula I when the salt ion is also optically active. Compounds of formula I have at least one asymmetric carbon atom, ie the carbon atom bearing the hydroxy and suhstituted phenyl groups, and, when R1 R2 and R are different, the carbon atom bcaring Rand R2 is also a centre of asymmetry. The compounds may, therefore, exist in at least two and often four stereoisomeric forms. The present invention encompasses all stereoisomers of the compounds of formula I whether free from other stereoisomers or admixed with other stereoisomers in any proportion and thus includes, for instance, racemic mixtures of optical isomers. Preferably, the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl and substituted phenyl groups has the R configuration. The most potent compounds of formula I are those wherein R1 and R2 are different and both asymmetric carbon atoms are in the R configuration. The absolute configuration of any compound of formula I may be determined by conventional X ray crystallographic techniques. It is believed that, in the 13C nmr spectrum of compounds of formula I wherein one of R1 and R2 is hydrogen and the other is methyl, the diastereoisomer having the greater anti obesity and anti hyperglycaemic activity is that for which the signal of the methyl group carbon atom appears at higher field the lower numerical value when expressed in ppm in D6 dimethyl sulphoxide solution. The paired resonances often appear at approximately 20 ppm less active and slightly below 20 ppm more active down field from tetramethylsilane. Other paired resonances can occur for the carbon atoms attached directly to the nitrogen atom and the carbon which carries the hydroxyl and phenyl groups. Again the paired resonances of the more active diastereoisomer of the investigated compounds appear at the higher field position. The prcsent invention provides a process for producing a compound of formula I , or a salt thereof, which process comprises reducing an oxo group and or double or triple bond and or cleaving and N benzyl group of a compound of formula II EMI5.1 wherein R1, R3, R4, A and n are as defined in relation to formula I ,R5 is a group R2 as defined in relation to formula I or together with R7 forms a bond, RG is C 6 straight or branched chain alkylene, optionally containing a carbon carbon double or triple bond,R7 is hydrogen or benzyl or together with R5 or R8 forms a bond,R8 is hydrogen or together with R9 forms an oxo group or together with R7 forms a bond,R9 is hydrogen or together with R8 forms an oxo group,R10 is hydroxyl or together with R11 forms an oxo group, Rll is hydrogen or together with R10 forms an oxo group provided that there is no more than one oxo group represented by any of R8 to R11 an optionally thereafter forming a salt of the compound of formula I so formed and or converting the compound of formula I so formed into a further compound of formula I . Conversion of a compound of formula I into a further compound of formula I may be effected by, for instance, forming an amide from an ester, using conventional methods. Where there are two or more reducible moieties in the compound of formula II these may be reduced separately in any order or simultaneously. The aforementioned reductions may be effected by conventional chemical methods or by catalytic methods.Suitably, chemical reduction may be effected with, aluminium amalgam, lithium aluminium hydride, sodium cyanoborohydride or sodium borohydride. Catalytic hydrogenation may be carried out using catalysts such as palladium on charcoal, or platinum, for instance, as platinum oxide. Reduction by sodium borohydride is conveniently effected in a lower alkanolic solvent such as methanol or ethanol. The reaction is generally carried out at from 0 200C. Reduction by lithium aluminium hydride is conveniently effected in a dry, ether solvent such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran at ambient or elevated temperatures. Catalytic reduction is conveniently effected in a conventional hydrogenation solvent such as a lower alkanol, for instance ethanol. The hydrogenation is generally carried out under hydrogen gas at about 1 to 10 atmosphemspressure and at ambient or elevated temperatures. Reduction of a compound of formula II wherein R7 is benzyl is conveniently effected by catalytic hydrogenation, preferably using palladium on charcoal as catalyst. Preferred aspects of the process comprise reducing a compound of formula IIA EMI8.1 or reducing a compound of formula IIB EMI8.2 or reducing a compound of formula IIC EMI8.3 or reducing a compound of formula IID EMI8.4 or reducing a compound of formula IIE EMI8.5 or reducing a compound of formula II F EMI9.1 wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, A and n are as defined in relation to formula I and R6, R10 and R11 are as defined in relation to formula it1. The present invention also provides another process for producing a compound of formula I or a salt thereof, which process comprises reacting a compound of formula III EMI10.1 wherein , R R2,R X, and n are as defined in relation to formula I with a compound of formula IV EMI10.2 wherein R3 and A are as defined in relation to formula I , and Y is a group capable of reacting with the amine of formula III thus forming a compound of formula I , and optionally thereafter forming a salt of the compound of formula I so formed. Typical examples of compounds of formula IV are compounds of formulae IVA and IVB EMI11.1 wherein R3 and A are as defined in relation to formula I and Z1 is a leaving group, preferably halogen or tosyloxy. The reaction of a compound of formula III with a compound of formula IVA is conveniently effected in a solvent such as a lower alkanol, preferably ethanol. The reaction of a compound of formula III with a compound of formula IVB is conveniently conducted in a solvent, such as dimethyl sulphoxide, at elevated temperature, preferably about 509C, for about 3 days. The present invention provides a further process for the production of compounds of formula I or salts thereof, which process comprises reacting a compound of formula V EMI12.1 wherein R 3 and A are as defined in relation to formula I with a compound of formula VI EMI12.2 wherein R1, R4, X and n are as defined in relation to formula I , and Z is a leaving group preferably halogen or tosyloxy. .llhe preparation of compounds of formula V is described in Published European Patent Application No. 0 021 636. The reaction of a compound of formula V with a compound of formula VI is conveniently effected in a solvent such as dimethyl sulphoxide at an elevated temperature, preferably about 50 C for about two or three days. A preferred process for producing compounds of formula I comprises the reduction of a compound of formula IIA , especially using sodium borohydride in methanol at ambient temperatures. The salts of compounds of formula I may be produced by treating the compound of formula I with the appropriate acid, or when the compound is a carboxylic acid by treatment with an appropriate base. Compounds of formula I and salts thereof, produced by the above processes, may be recovered by conventional methods. Compounds of formula II may be produced by reacting a compound of formula IIIA EMI13.1 wherein R1 R2 R4 and n are as defined in relation to formula I and R6 is as defined in relation to formula II t with a compound of formula VII EMI14.1 3 wherein R and A are as defined in relation to formula I and Z3 is a group which is capable of reacting with the amine of formula IIIA thus forming a compound of formula II . Typical examples of compounds of formula VII are EMI14.2 or its hydrate or hemi acetal of a lower alkanol EMI14.3 wherein Z4 is a leaving group, preferably bromine EMI15.1 wherein R3 and A are as defined in relation to formula I . Conventional conditions suitable for use with the particular compound of formula VII may be used for this reaction. Thus the reaction of a compound of formula VIIA with a compound of formula IIIA is conveniently conducted at elevated temperatures under conditions resulting in the removal of the water formed during the reaction. A particularly suitable method is to perform the reaction in a solvent, such as benzene, heated under reflux and to remove the water azeotropically using a Dean and Stark trap. The reaction of a compounds of formula VIIB with a compound of formula IIIA is conveniently conducted in a polar organic solvent such as acetonitrile or butanone, at an elevated temperature, for instance heated under reflux. The reaction of a compound of formula VIIC with a compound of formula IIIA is conveniently conducted under standard peptide formation reaction conditions. Alternatively,a compound of formula II may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula VIII EMI15.2 wherein R3 and A are as defined in relation to formula II and Z5 is a leaving group, preferably halogen or tosyloxy,and R10 and R11 are as defined in relation to formula II with a compound of formula IX EMI16.1 wherein R1, R2, R4 and n are as defined in relation to formula I , and R6 is as defined in relation to formula 11 . A particularly preferred process for producing certain compounds of formula II is by reacting a compound of formula V as hereinbefore defined with a compound of the formula X EMI16.2 wherein R , 4and n are as defined in relation to formula I , and R6 is as defined in relation to formula II . The reaction of a compound of formula V with a compound of formula X is conveniently effected under conditions which result in the removal of water formed during the reaction. A particularly suitable method is to perform the reaction in a solvent, such as benzene, heated under reflux, and to remove the water azeotropically using a Dean and Stark trap. It is often convenient to prepare the compound of formula II and reduce it, in situ, to the desired compound of formula I without isolation of the compound of formula II . Compounds of formula I having a single asymmetric carbon atom may, if desired, be resolved into individual enantiomers by conventional means, for example, by the use of an optically active acid as a resolving agent. Those compounds of formula I having two asymmetric carbon atoms may be separated into diastereoisomeric pairs of enantiomers by, for example, fractional crystallisation from a suitable solvent such as ethyl acetate. The pair of enantiomers thus obtained may be resolved into individual stereoisomers by conventional means such. as by the use of an optically active acid as a resolving agent. Suitable optically active acids which may be used as resolving agents are described in Topics inStereochemistry , Vol. 6, Wiley Interscience, 1971,Allinger, N.L., and Eliel, W.L. Eds. Alternatively any enantiomer of a compound of formula I may be obtained by stereospecific synthesis using optically pure starting materials of known configuration. By using single enantiomers of a compound of formula IIIA and of a compound of formula VIIC a stereospecific synthesis of a compound of formula II is achieved. This may then be reduced to a compound of formula I without altering the configuration of the two asymmetric carbon atoms. Thus, for example, reaction of a compound of formula IIIA with theR absolute configuration and a compound of formula VIIC with the R absolute configuration would afford a compound of formula II and, on reduction, a compound of formula I with the R, absolute configuration. By reacting a single enantiomer of a compound of formula III with a single enantiomer of a compound of formula IVA or IVB , the direct stereospecific synthesis of a single enantiomer of a compound of formula I is effected. Thus, for example, reaction of a compound of formula III with the R absolute configuration with a compound of formula IVA with theR absolute configuration would afford a compound of formula I with the R absolute configuration. A compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof hereinafter the drug may be administered as the pure drug, however, it is preferred that the drug be administered as a pharmaceutical composition also comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Accordingly, the present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor. As used herein the terms pharmaceutical composition and pharmaceutically acceptable embrace compositions and ingredients for both human and, veterinary use. Usually the compositions of the present invention will be adapted for oral administration although compositions for administration by other routes, such as by injection are also envisaged. Particularly suitable compositions for oral administration are unit dosage forms such as tablets and capsules. Other fixed unit dosage forms, such as powders presented in sachets, may also be used. In accordance with conventional pharmaceutical practice the carrier may comprise a diluent, filler, disintegrant, wetting agent, lubricant, colourant, flavourant or the like. Typical carriers may, therefore, comprise such agents as microcrystalline cellulose, starch, sodium starch glycollate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinylpolypyrrolidone, magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulphate, sucrose and the like. Most suitably the composition will be provided in unit dose form. Such unit doses will normally comprise 0.1 to 500 mg of the drug, more usually 0.1 to 250 mg and favourably 0.1 to 100 mg. The present invention further provides a method for treating obesity and or hyperglycaemia in humans or domestic mammals, which method comprises administering an effective, non toxic amount of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to obese and or hyperglycaemic humans or domestic mammals. In treating hyperglycaemic or obese humans the drug may be taken in doses, such as those described above, one to six times a day in a manner such that the total daily dose for a 70 kg adult will generally be about 0.1 to 1000 mg, and more usually about 1 to 500 mg. In treating hyperglycaemic or obese animals, especially dogs, the drug may be administered by mouth, usually once or twice a day and at about 0.025 mg kg to 10 mg kg, for example 0.1 mg kg to 2 mg kg. The invention will now be illustrated with reference to the following Examples, which are not intended to limit the scope in any way. As used in the Examples, the term mixture of diastereoisomers refers to a mixture of two pairs of racemic stereoisomers having a diastereoisomeric relationship with each other.

TREATED CONTROL 4 11.4 17.47 21.68 DEMONSTRATION OF EFFECTIVENESS OF COMPOUNDS ii Effect on energy expenditure The effect of the compounds on the energy expenditure of mice was demonstrated by means of the following procedure Female CFLP mice each weighing approximately 24 g, were given food and water ad lib before and during the experiment. The compounds were dissolved in water by addition of one mole of hydrochloric acid per mole of compound and these solutions were administered orally to each of 12 mice. A further 12 mice were dosed orally with water. The mice were placed in boxes through which air was drawn and the oxygen content of the air leaving the boxes was measured. The energy expenditure of the mice was calculated for 21 hours after dosing from the volume of air leaving the boxes and its oxygen content, following the principles described by J.B. de V. Weir, J. Physiol. London 109, 1 9, 1949 . The food intake of the mice was measured over this same period of 21 hours. The results are expressed as a percentage of the mean food intake or rate of energy expenditure of the mice dosed with water. COMPOUNDS OF DOSE MEAN ENERGY MEAN EXAMPLE NO. mg kg p.o.

The compounds under study were administered orally as an aqueous solution to each of 6 mice. 30 minutes later a blood sample 20p1 was obtained from the tail for the analysis of blood glucose. Immediately after taking this blood sample, glucose lg Kg body weight was administered subsutaneously to each mouse. 6 mice were given water as a control. Blood samples were then obtained from each mouse at 30 minute intervals for 120 minutes. Compounds that produced a significant P0.05 reduction of blood glucose, compared with control mice given water, at any time interval, were considered active.The area under the blood glucose curve over the 2 hour period after the administration of the glucose was calculated for each compound and compared with the value for control animals.COMPOUNDS OF DOSE REDUCTION IN AREA UNDEREXAMPLE NO.
