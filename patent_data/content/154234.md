# Substituted tyrosil alanine dipeptide amides.

## Abstract
Dipeptides of formula I and acid addn salts are new. where R1 1 4C alkyl, R2 H, OH, OCO2R1 or 1 4C alkyl R3 H or 1 6C alkyl, R4,R5 H or 1 6C alkyl, n 1 6, X H, OH, OCO2R1, A cyclohexyl or phenyl opt. substd. with 1 or more 1 6C alkyl, one or more NH2, OH, halogen, NO2 or 1 6C alkoxy, v represents the asymmetric C that may be racemic or have the D or L config. w represents the asymmetric C when R4 and R5 are not the same that may be racemic or have the D or L config. . Several cpds. I are claimed e.g. 2,6 dimethyltyrosyl N 3 phenylpropyl D alancinaminde hydrochloride Ia and 2,6 dimethyltyrosyl N 3 phenyl propyl is ovalinamide monohydrochloride.
