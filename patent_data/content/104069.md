# Pedal crank and chain wheel assembly for bicycles.

## Abstract
A chain wheel 10 is supported on a pedal crank 2 in a bicycle, lost motion being provided, in order to prevent lock up when using a pedal crankshaft operated brake, by supporting the inner periphery and one side of the wheel 10 on a chain wheel carrier 28 , and taking up play on the other side of the wheel by using a nut 50 to force a resilient washer 42 into a cone. A spring 24 connecting the wheel 10 and the crank 2 is made progressive by causing it to wrap onto a cylindrical surface of the washer 42 concentric with the axis of the crankshaft 4 .
