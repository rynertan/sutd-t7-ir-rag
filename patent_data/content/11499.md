## Description
LIQUID FORMULATIONSFIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to liquid formulations capable of depositing perfumes on fabric surfaces. The formulation may be used in diluted form and examples of the fabric surfaces are cotton, wool, polyacrylic, polyamide and polyester fibres. These formulations are intended for use in the rinse cycle of a fabric cleaning operation. The liquid formulations of the invention will normally be used to provide a fabric softening effect. Perfumes are liquid compositions consisting of a number of organic compounds, capable of appreciation by smell. The compounds are usually derived from natural sources but synthetic materials are also used. Formulations intended for the laundering of fabric will normally contain a perfume to provide a pleasant after smell on the laundered fabrics. Thus powder and liquid detergent formulations, and rinse cycle formulations contain perfumes. It is desirable to have the perfume in a fabric treatment formulation used efficiently becau,ca it is a relatively high cost component of any formulation. In use the perfume will be present in the formulation at a relatively low concentration and dilution will cause the fabric to be in contact with a liquid system containing a very low concentration of the perfume. BACEGROWND ART vhe desirability of enhancing the effectiveness of perfumes nas been acknowledged in the patent literature.United Sates Patent Specification No. 4 152 272 Young describes a fabric conditioning composition comprising particles of a wax like carrier and a perfume. BritishPatent Specification No. 1 544 863 Schilling et al describes a fabric conditioning composition for use in an automatic laundry dryer comprising particles of a mixed cationic non ionic carrier and a perfume. InGerman patent application No. 2 732 985 of Unilever Limited a deposition system is described which provides increased deposition of materials providing a perceivable effect, for example perfumes. Amines are disclosed as matrix materials, but a cationic material is required as an essential component of the dispersed phase including the perceivable component. DISCLOSTJRE OF THE INVENTION We have now discovered that surprising good perfume deposition on fabrics can be achieved without the incorporation of cationic materials in perfume carrying amine particles. Thus, according to the invention, there is provided a liquid formulation for depositing perfumes on fabric surfaces, wherein the formulation comprises an aqueous base having i a first dispersed phase constituting from about 0.5 to about 50 by weight of the formulation and consisting of particles having an average size of from about 0.1 micron to about 200 microns, preferably 0.1 to 5.0 micron, the particles comprising an intimate mixture of a from about 0.5 to about 50 by weight, based on the weight of the particles, of a perfume, and b from about 50 to about 99.5 by weight, based on the weight of the particles of a matrix comprising at least one water dispersible amine of the formula R NR1P2 where R is an alkyl or alkenyl group having from 8 to 22 carbon atoms, R is hydrogen or an alkyl or alkX group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms and P2 is hydrogen or an alkyl, alkenyl or amino alkyl group having from 1 to 22 carbon atoms, the matrix containing no added cationic material and ii a second dispersed phase constituting from about 0.5 to about 30 by weight of the formulation and comprising a fabric conditioning agent. The aqueous base will contain water as a major constituent. While it isfipossible for this to be the sole component of the base, the latter will usually include other materials, for example, electrolytes, buffering agents, short chain alcohols, emulsifiers, colouring materials, bactericides, antioxidants, surface active agents and fluorescers. The alkyl groups, alkenyl groups and alkyl portion of the anino alkyl groups may be linear or branched.Preferably the amine is a primary or tertiary compound or a diamine, particularly a diamine of the formula R NH C 3 NH2, where R is as defined above. Preferred compounds are methyl dihardened tallow tertiary amine, hardened tallow primary amine, methyl, dicoco tertiary amine, coco primary amine and N alkyl 1 3 propylene diamines, where the alkyl group may be hardened tallow, coconut or C18 C20 mixture. he amines of utility in the invention can be solid, liquid or pasty and will have a solubility in water of not more than about 1 weight volume.The amines will be dispersible in the aqueous base liquid The fabric conditioning agent may be selected from the classes of dialkyl quaternary ammonium salts e.g distearyl dimethyl ammonium chloride amine salt derivatives amphoteric compounds e.g. alkyl sulphobetaines and imidazoline derivatives agents fcsm d by complexing cationic and anionic species, e.g. as described in UK patent specification 2 007 735. A list of suitable conditioning materials is given in German application 2 732 985. The perfume may be selected from any perfumes and any mixtures thereof. Examples of fabric substantive perfumes suitable for use in the present invention are listed in S Arctander, Perfume Flavors and Chemicals,Volumes I and II, published by the author, Montclair, New Jersey, USA and the Merck Index, 8th Edition, Merck Co.Inc., Rahway, New Jersey, USA. Deodorant perfumes such as disclosed in United States specification 4 134 838 may also be used. A method of preparing the liquid formulation of the invention, includes the step of forming a liquid mixture of the amine and the perfume and dispersing the mixture in water. The preferred method is to melt the amine and the perfume together and then disperse the mixture in heated water. An aid to dispersion e.g. high speed stirrers, ultrasonic agitators, vibrating reeds and continuous mixers may be used. In an alternative method the melt is solidified in bulk and then dispersed into water at ambient temperature.BEST MODE OF CARRYING OUT INVENTION Examples of formulations according to the invention will now be given. The benefit achieved by use of the invention is demonstrated using the following test method Three pieces of 20 cm x 20 cm terry towelling T or bulked acrylic BA were rinsed in a Derg o Tometer a Registered Trade Mark for 4 minutes at 75 cycles per minute agitation. The rinse liquor was formed by adding 2 mls of formulation to 800 mls of water. The samples were spun dry for 30 seconds and dried overnight. The perfume effect was then gauged by an experienced panel and graded, from 0 to 5. The average grade was taken for each formulation. EXAMPLE 1 0.9 g of methyl di hardened tallow amine was melted and 0.2 g of a perfume added the amine was maintained as near to its melting point as possible consistent with good mixing. The melt was then added to 50 g water at 7000 and a dispersion formed with the aid of an ultrasonic probe. The average particle size was 04 microns. Dimethyl di hardened tallow ammonium chloride 5 g was dispersed in water 50 g and the two dispersions mixed. The perfume effect was gauged and compared to a control formulation. This control was formed by dispersing 5 g of the above quaternary ammonium salt in water 100 g and adding 0.2 g of the same perfume. The results of this and the following Examples2 14are given in the Table I which quotes the average grading for each formulation and defines the amine used by chain length of the alkyl group and type of amine. EXAMPIE 2 Example 1 was repeated using methyl dicoco amine. EXAMPLE 3 Example 1 was repeated using methyl di C18 C20 alkyl amine. The long chain alkyl group was formed by a 50 50 molar mixture of C18 and C20 alkyl chains. EXAMPIE 4 Example 1 was repeated using hardened tallow primary amine. EXAMPLE 5 Example 1 was repeated using coconut primary amine. EXAMPLE 6 Example 1 was repeated using C C18 C20 primary amine. EXAMPLE 7 Example I was repeated using di hardened tallow secondary amine. EXAMPLE 8 Example 1 was repeated using di coconut secondary amine. EXAMPLE 9 Example 1 was repeated using dimethyl mono hardened tallow tertiary amine. EXAMPLE 10 Example 1 was repeated using dimethyl mono coconut tertiary amine. EXAMPLE 11 Example 1 was repeated using dimethyl mono C18 G20 alkyl tertiary amine. EXAMPLE 12 Example 1 was repeated using N hardened tallow 1 3 propylene diamine. EXAMPLE 13 Example 1 was repeated using N coco 1 3 propylene diamine. EXAMPLE 14 Example 1 was repeated using N C18 C20 1 3 propylene diamine.
