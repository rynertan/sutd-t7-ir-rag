# Apparatus for connecting digital data.

## Abstract
Apparatus for connecting first and second digital data which overlap before and after a connecting point, and in which said digital data is muted after the connecting point for limiting errors in the output from the apparatus, the appar atus comprising a detector 17 which detects when the muting of the second digital data terminates and which generates detection signals in response thereto, and cross fader 22 which gradually fades out the first digital data and gradually fades in the second digital data in response to the detection signals.
