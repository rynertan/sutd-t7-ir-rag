# Method and apparatus for automatic stacking of extended articles.

## Abstract
The battens 8 are forwarded in a predetermined number and mutual distance beneath the transport device 5 with the extrusions 4 and thereafter moved upwards lifting the extrusions from the transport device. The released transport device is withdrawn beneath the extrusions, which are thereafter reposed on the battens lowered at a variable speed down to a container 3 . The laying apparatus comprises a vertically mobile frame construction 2 with the batten bearers attached in pairs which are transferred in the apparatus longitudinal direction along parallel guiding rails 7 fastened to the frame construction. The aparatus, which during the stacking of extrusions surrounds the container 3 , can be completely withdrawn beneath floor level in a grave 1 .

## Description
Method and Apparatus for Automatic Stacking of Extended ArticlesThe present invention relates to a method for automatic stacking of extended articles, especially extrusions of aluminium or other metals, and also an apparatus to carry out the method.After separation from the die extrusions, e.g. of aluminium orAl alloys, are immediately lifted from the run out table over to a cooling table and thereafter transported by means of a crosstransfer walking beam conveyor and or other conveying belts to a stretcher and further on to a saw for exact cutting of the stretched extrusions. The extrusions, after having been cut in predetermined lengths, are then piled on racks or containers for subsequent treatment and or transport from the plants.The extrusions, which at this stage are unhardened, are especially sensitive to surface damages. Lifting beams, transport arms, storing tables etc. are therefore coated with elastic coating, and moderate speeds are applied. It is still common practice to lay down the battens between the extrusion layers manually during the stacking in order to ensure a gentle batten laying without free fall and thereby danger of damages on the extrusions.The various known stacking and batten laying machines applied in handling of timber have several drawbacks and cannot be applied to extruded metal profiles. The machines are situated either over or next to the timber stacks and occupy a lot of space.Furthermore, there is no possibility of changing over to manual stacking when it is required, e.g. for tubular products, and these constructions are mainly based upon free fall of the battens on wooden members. One stacking apparatus based upon a portal bridge crane construction is known on the market. Also this construction is space consuming, requires high capital costs, and the maximal length of the stacked extrusions is limited to 6 7 m. Another variant of the above described automatic stacking apparatus is based upon several individually powered grip devices which carry out the batten laying between the extrusions. In addition to the already mentioned shortages of the portal bridge crane based construction, such as high capital costs and space requirement, synchronization of all individual grip devices gives low reliability of performance and high maintenance costs. Nor does this construction make manual batten laying possible.It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide a new method and an apparatus to carry out this method, which ensure automatic, reliable and gentle batten laying, maintaining at the same time high performance corresponding to the capacity of the extrusion press.another object of the invention is to provide an apparatus with minimal space requirements, which can be integrated with the existing handling equipment attached to the extrusion press, and which also gives possibility for manual stacking of extrusions.This is achieved according to the invention, as it appears from the accompanying patent claims.The invention will now be described in more detail and illustrated by means of the drawings, Figs. 1 3, whereFig. 1 shows schematically the apparatus according to the in vention in a vertical cross section with a container and transportation means for the extrusionsFig. 2 is a cross sectional view taken along the line I I in Fig. 1 Fiq. 3 shows schematically in more detail an apparatus with drive means for transport of batten bearersThe apparatus, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, is situated next to the run out table from an extrusion press not shown in theFigures in a grave 1 . The apparatus comprises a vertically mobile frame construction 2 surrounding a container 3 for stacking of extrusions 4 .The container 3 shown in theFigures rests on a rack 15 and is inserted in removed from the apparatus by cranes, trucks or similar means, but also alternative constructions such as railway container cars can be used.Transport means, shown in the Figures as conveyors 5 , transfer extrusions 4 from the run out table over the container 3 .Batten bearers 6 grouped in pairs, which are moved along two parallel rails 7 fastened to the frame construction 2 in the direction of the apparatus longitudinal axis, ensure transfer of a certain number of battens 8 under the conveyors 5 with the extrusions 4 .Fig. 2 shows the apparatus in a cross section taken along the apparatus longitudinal axis.The batten bearers 6 are by means of synchronized chains 10 pulled forward under the batten magazine 9 , which ensures an automatic release of the piled battens 8 . A predeterminated number of battens are fed under the conveyors 5 with the extrusions 4 .The special construction of the lock device for forwarding of batten bearers is shown in more detail in Fig. 3. The batten bearers 6 are transferred forward by means of chains 10 mounted on the rails 7 . Besides standard members 11 the chain also comprises locking members 12 which, when passing the stored batten bearers, engage in a complementary formed recess part 13 in the batten bearers and are in this manner locked during the forward transfer along the guiding rails 7 . The automatic batten laying comprises the followingEMI4.1 1. When the apparatus is in starting position, it is lowered down to the grave 1 beneath the floor level, and the con veyors 5 are withdrawn under the run out table from the extrusion press. The container 3 is placed on the rack 15 .2. By means of an electric steering device not shown in the Figures one predetermines the number of battens to be placed as discrete layer between the extrusions 4 and at the same time the distance between the battens is chosen.3. Conveyors 5 with extrusions 4 are moved over the con tainer 3 , and simultaneously the batten bearers 6 with the battens 8 are transferred under the conveyors 5 by means of synchronied chains 10 . 4. When all extrusions are placed over the container, the mobile frame 2 is thereafter moved upwards so that the extrusions are lifted up from the conveyors 5 and are reposed on the battens.5. The released conveyors are then drawn back under the run out table, and the extrusions are lowered at a variable speed down to the container to begin with at a higher speed which is subsequently reduced when the extrusions are approaching the bottom of the container or the last stacked extrusion layer .6. When the battens with the extrusions reach the bottom or the last piled extrusion layer, the battens are released from the batten bearers 6 , and these bearers are thereafter moved slightly backwards, raised and returned to starting position behind the batten magazine. 7. A new cycle starts from step No. 3, and the whole operation is repeated until the container is full, the apparatus is lowered down to starting position and the container is re moved from the rack 15 .Method for automatic stacking of extrusions according to the invention and apparatus to carry out this method as described above have several distinct advantages compared to the present known devices. The whole apparatus can be completely withdrawn beneath floor level when the profile stacking of extrusions is finished. This is an important feature with regard to modernization of present installations with limitation in existing transport system, e.g. cranes, railway cars etc. Furthermore, the released area space can be applied for possible manual stacking of extrusions when it is required because of the shape of the profiles. This again represents a further saving of floor area which normally has to be reserved for such purposes.Transfer of the batten bearers with the battens to lifting position under conveyors with extrusions is done directly whithout need for complicated connecting links which are typical for the known stacking and batten laying machines for handling of timber. This feature in combination with simple and robust chain drive mechanism for transport of the batten bearers increases the reliability of the apparatus performance and reduces the maintenance costs.
