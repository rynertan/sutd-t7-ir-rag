# Method for manufacturing a coaxial line rigid probe interposer.

## Abstract
A method is disclosed for manufacturing a coaxial line rigid probe interposer that has exceedingly small coaxial lines and is particularly useful in high frequency testing of integrated circuits. A plurality of through holes 18, 20 is formed within an electrically conductive body 12 constituting the outer con ductor of a plurality of coaxial lines. At least the central con ductor 22 for one of the coaxial lines is formed of a relatively large diameter for functioning as a voltage probe 14 and at least one other central conductor 28 is formed of a relatively small diameter for functioning as a signal probe 16 . The central conductors of the coaxial lines are initially coated with a first dielectric 24, 30 having a high dielectric constant so that a minimal coating provides sufficient capacit ance permitting greater flexibility and center conducting siz ing. The dielectric coated center conductors are thereafter po sitioned in oversized holes 18, 20 within the conductive body 12 . The annular free space existing between the inside wall of a hole and the outer circumference of the first dielectric is filled as by capillary action, with a second, liquid dielectric which flows into the fissures and cracks within the first dielectric prior to curing.
