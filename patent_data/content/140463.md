# Lightweight metal hydrogen cell with improved plate stack supporting means.

## Abstract
A metal hydrogen cell is disclosed in which the durabil ity of the battery is substantially increased and the system mass and volume are reduced. A plate stack within the casing is compressed by a spring which is supported from the casing without support from the terminals. The spring support is external to the cell stack that is, it does not pass through the stack. Optionally, terminals are positioned at non axial positions on the casing, extending outwardly from each domed end of the casing at axially offset positions on the domed ends so that the terminals do not extend beyond the length and diameter of the casing. This contributes to the reduction in the effective size of the cell.
