## Description
This invention generally relates to plastic fasteners, and more particularly to plastic fasteners of the type having expandable locking means for securely maintaining the fasteners in place within an opening. Plastic fastening devices having expandable locking means are well known. For example, several fastening devices of this type are described in detail in United States Patent 3,651,734. While these devices work very well in a wide range of applications there is room for improvement of them in several important respects. For example, one type of such fastening device includes a hook portion, and a plurality of these devices are commonly secured to a wall to hold a rack, such as a tool rack or a merchandise display rack, up against that wall. These particular fastening devices are normally locked within a wall opening by means of a screw that is inserted through a screw opening in the device and that engages a toggle lock thereof to hold that lock in an overcenter position. The hook portions of these fasteners are spaced an appreciable distance from the specific portions of the devices that form those screw openings, so that, in use, the screws inserted through the screw openings do not directly support the hook portions of the fasteners or any weight mounted thereon. This problem would also exist when these fastening devices are secured to ceilings, and a similar problem is encountered when other types of fastening devices are attached to floors or decks and used as supports for other structural members. Also, no prior art device of the general type outlined above has been specifically designed for use as a harness that may be employed to gather a bundle of wires or cables, and in particular, that may be used to hold together wire or cable bundles of various thicknesses. Moreover, prior art fasteners of the general type previously described have not been particularly designed for attachment to ropes or cables, with the toggle locks of the fasteners free to attach the ropes or cables, as desired or needed, to some other device such as a bracket or ring that, in turn, is rigidly secured to a boat deck or dock, or to a ceiling, floor, or wall member. FR A 1533232 discloses a wire harness consisting of a strap with spaced projections, attached at one end to an expansible fixing plug provided with a slot through which the strap can be inserted to form a loop of adjustable size. A pin may be detachably provided on the free end of the strap, for insertion into the plug to expand it. Without however serving to fix the strap which consequently may become loose. US A 3144695 discloses a wire harness consisting of a strap integral with an expansible plug and provided at one end with an integral pin for expanding the plug. For providing a loop of adjustable size, the strap may have a further portion extending from the plug in the opposite direction from the portion carrying the pin, provided with apertures which are to be fitted over the plug under the strap, thereby reducing the effective length of the plug. Wire harnesses of these known types are not compatible with toggle locking means. An object of the present invention is to provide an adjustable wire harness with toggle locking means and positive fixing of the harness size. According to a first embodiment of the invention there is provided a one piece integrally moulded plastics fastener for use as a wire harness, comprising a base, locking means integral with one side of the base, the locking means being insertable in an aperture in a structural member and being expansible for fastening the base to the said member, and holding means integral with the opposite side of the base and comprising an elongated flexible strap having a first end portion connected to a first side of said base, a second end portion spaced from said base, and means for engaging said base to secure said second end portion of said strap therein and the base including a transverse slot to receive said second end portion of the strap in a close sliding fit and to urge said engaging means into pressure engagement with said base member said slot having opposite first and second transverse ends each adapted to receive said second end portion of the strap, characterised in that the locking means is a toggle structure which has a collapsed state in which the locking means is narrow for insertion in the said aperture, and a wider expanded state in which it positively locks the base to the structural member, the positive locking being provided by an overcentre positioning of the toggle structure and by insertion of a separate fixing member, the base has an open pathway extending through it to receive said fixing member or a separate member for expanding the toggle structure to its overcentre position, and the strap has a line of openings to be aligned with the said pathway. In this embodiment the means for engaging the base to secure the strap may for example comprise multiple teeth based along the strap. The base member preferably includes a pair of notches to receive means for holding or locking the toggle lock in the expanded position. Also, the base member forms a transverse slot to receive the second end of the strap in a close sliding fit and to urge the teeth of the strap into pressure engagement with the base member. This slot has opposite first and second transverse ends, each of which is adapted to receive the second end portion of the strap. This wire harness may be easily used to hold a bundle of wires together. At the same time, the fastener is very simple to install and to lock within an opening, such as a wall opening, and in particular, the base member of the fastener does not interfere with locking the fastener within that opening. Also, the wire harness is simple and inexpensive to manufacture, and is made from a plastic by means of an inexpensive injection molding process. The harness may be used to loop a bundle of wires together in either of two slightly different locations, better enabling the user of the harness to insure that the wire bundle is held at a preferred location. In addition, when the strap is inserted into the slot, the strap itself does not interfere with locking the toggle lock in its expanded position. Further, the same screw that is used to force the toggle lock into its locked position may also be used to lock the strap within the slot formed by the base member of the fastener. Also according to the invention, there is provided a one piece integrally moulded plastics fastener for use as a wire harness, comprising a base, locking means integral with one side of the base, the locking means being insertable in an aperture in a structural member and being expansible for fastening the base to the said member, and holding means integral with the opposite side of the base and comprising an elongated flexible strap having one end integral with the base and extending laterally from the base, a spacing being provided at the said opposite side of the base to receive the strap for forming a wire holding loop of adjustable size, and a fixing member at the other end of the strap for insertion through the base to fix the locking means, characterised in that the locking means is a toggle structure which has a collapsed state in which the locking means is narrow for insertion in the said aperture, and a wider expanded state in which it positively locks the base to the structural member, a key is integrally connected to said opposite end of said strap, said base includes a keyway to receive said key, said strap and key are movable between an open position, wherein the key is spaced from said keyway, and a closed position, wherein the key extends within the keyway and connects said base and opposite end of the strap together to form a closed loop, the positive locking being provided by an overcentre positioning of the toggle structure effected by insertion of said key, the strap has spaced apertures matching the keyway, and a groove is provided between the base and the said one end of the strap, such that an intermediate region of the strap can be placed in the groove with a selected aperture in line with the keyway, and the key can be inserted through this aperture and the keyway to hold the strap and expand the locking means. This device largely shares the advantages referred to above. Further benefits and advantages of the invention will become apparent from a consideration of the following description given with reference to the accompanying drawings which show embodiments of the present invention. Figures 1 and 2 are front and side views respectively of a plastic wire harness in accordance with the present invention. Figure 3 and 4 are top views taken along line III III of Figure 1, with portions of the wire harness broken away in Figure 4. Figures 5 and 6 are side views of the harness illustrated in Figures 1 through 4, with Figure 5 showing the elongated strap of the harness after being inserted in a first direction through the slot thereof, and Figure 6 showing the elongated strap after being inserted in a second direction through the slot. Figure 7 is a tope view taken along line VII VII of Figure 6, and Figures 8 to 11 are perspective view of a second plastic wire harness in accordance with this invention, with portions of the wire harness broken away in Figure 11. Figures 1 through 7 show plastic wire harness 100 generally comprising base member 102, elongated flexible strap 104, and expansible locking means 106. More specifically, base member 102 includes top, bottom and side walls 110, 112 and 114 and flexible strap 104 includes multiple teeth 116 and multiple openings 120. Expansible locking means 106 includes first and second toggle arms 122 and 124, pivotal connecting joint 126, and first and second flexible connecting arms 130 and 132. The various parts of wire harness 100 are formed together from a resilient plastic in an injection molding process. Suitable materials for the construction of wire harness 100 and the other fastener embodiments described below include polypropelene, polyethylene, and nylon, as well as a wide variety of materials which may be chosen with consideration to the fastener configuration, the manner of formation, and the intended use. Top and bottom walls 110 and 112 of base member 102 are spaced apart, are substantially parallel, and form slot 134 which extends completely through the base member. Side walls 114 extend between and are connected to left and right edges of top and bottom walls 110 and 112, spacing those walls apart. Bottom wall 112 includes front notch 136 that extends rearward from a front edge of the bottom wall, and top wall 110 forms back notch 140 that extends forward from a back edge of the top wall. Portions of notches 136 and 140 overlap slightly, forming a longitudinal opening or pathway through base member 102. Expansible locking means 106 is integrally connected to base member 102 and is provided to secure wire harness 100 within an opening such as a wall opening. More specifically, flexible connecters 130 and 132 are joined to bottom wall 112 of base member 102 and extend downward and outward therefrom. Lateral ends of toggle arms 122 and 124 are integrally connected to the bottom outward ends of connector arms 130 and 132. Toggle arms 122 and 124 transversely extend across the bottom of harness 100, and centrally located end portions of the toggle members are joined together by integral pivotal connection 126. Pivotal connection 126 has a reduced thickness in comparison to the thickness of toggle arms 122 and 124, and the pivotal connection forms a small centrally located opening 134 that is longitudinally aligned with the overlapping portions of notches 136 and 140. Flexible connecters 130 and 132 are laterally spaced apart to define a central open area 142 into which the pivotal connection 126 and centrally located end portions of toggle arms 122 and 124 move upon collapse of the locking structure. Flexible strap 104 is integrally connected to base member 102 and longitudinally extends upward therefrom. More particularly, strap 104 has a substantially rectangular shape, a first longitudinal end of the strap is integrally connected to a front edge of wall 110 of base member 102, and a second longitudinal end of the strap is spaced from the base member. The front surface of strap 104 forms teeth 116. Teeth 116 extend transversely across strap 104, and are longitudinally distributed along a major portion thereof. Upper sides of teeth 116 have a relatively gradual slope, and lower sides of the teeth have a comparatively sharp slope. These lower sides of teeth 116 have arcuate shapes. Openings 120 are also longitudinally distributed along a major portion of strap 104, and preferably each tooth 116 forms one opening 120 centrally located between the left and right edges of strap 104. In use, second end of strap 104 is inserted through slot 134, and this end of the strap tapers inward to facilitate inserting a strap into the slot. The width of strap 104 is slightly less than the width of slot 134 and the depth of the strap that is its left to right dimension as viewed in Figure 2 at the peaks of teeth 116 is slightly greater than the height of slot 134. The length of strap 104 may vary, of course, depending on the particular application for wire harness 100. To use wire harness 100, a bundle of wires is gathered together, and strap 104 is looped around that bundle and inserted through slot 134, forming a closed loop 144. Preferably, of course, strap 104 is pulled tightly through slot 134, holding the wire bundle tightly together. Once the second end of strap 104 is inserted through slot 134, teeth 116 inhibit the strap from being pulled back outward through the slot. With particular reference to Figures 4 and 5, when strap 104 is inserted through slot 134 from the back end thereof, top wall 110 of base member 102 forces strap teeth 116 into pressure engagement with bottom wall 112 of the base member. Teeth 116 compress slightly as they move over the back portions of bottom wall 112, and then the teeth expand to their original shape as they move past the back edge of front notch 136 so that the teeth project slightly below the very top of that edge. If strap 104 is pulled outward, to the right as viewed in Figure 5, the acurately sloped, sharp sides of teeth 116 contact the back edge of notch 136, preventing, or at least inhibiting, further outward movement of the strap. Analogously, with particular reference now to Figures 3 and 6, when strap 104 is inserted through slot 134 from the front end thereof, bottom wall 112 of base member 102 forces strap teeth 116 into pressure engagement with top wall 110 of the base member. Teeth 116 compress slightly as they move past the front portion of top wall 110, and then the teeth expand to their original shape as they move past the front edge of back notch 140 so that they then project slightly above the very bottom of that front edge. If strap 104 is pulled outward, to the left as viewed in Figure 6, the arcuately shaped, sharply sloped sides of teeth 116 engage the front edge of notch 140, preventing, or at least inhibiting, further outward movement of the strap. To lock harness 100 within an opening, toggle arms 122 and 124 are pushed into their collapsed position, between connecting arms 130 and 132, and then the toggle arms are inserted through the opening. Once inserted through the opening, connecting members 130 and 132 flex outward due to their inherent resiliency, tending to pull toggle members 122 and 124 into their expanded over center position. If connecting members 130 and 132 do not pull toggle members 122 and 124 completely into their overcenter position, the toggle members may be pushed into that position and, in any case, the toggle members may be locked in the expanded position by inserting a screw through aligned portions of notches 136 and 140 and opening 134 and using that screw to push the toggle members outward. As is apparent from Figures 5 and 6, loop 144 may be formed in two slightly different locations. This gives the user of harness 100 increased flexibility as to where loop 144 may be located. Moreover, formation of loop 144 does not interfere with operation of expansible locking means 106, and thus harness 100 may be secured within an opening either prior to or after the loop is formed. When strap 104 is inserted through slot 134 from the front end thereof, the strap does not extend over top wall 110 of base member 102. In this case, strap 104 may be securely locked in place by aligning one of the openings 120 of the strap with aligned portions of front and back notches 136 and 140 and with central opening 134, and then inserting means such as a screw, through this opening of the strap, the aligned portions of notches 136 and 140, and the central opening 134. This same screw may be used to lock toggle arms 122 and 124 in their overcenter position. Of course, strap 104 may be unlocked from this position simply by removing the above mentioned screw. Figures 8 to 11 show a second wire harness 170 also in accordance with this invention. Harness 170 comprises locking means 171, flexible strap 172, and key 173. Locking means 171 includes toggle arms 175, pivotal connection 176, connecting arms 177, shoulder 178 and connecting flange 180 shown in broken lines in Figure 11 . Toggle 175 arms and connecting arms 177 operate substantially identically to toggle arms 154 and connecting arms 155 described above and so will not be described here in detail. A first end of flexible strap 172 is integrally connected to and transversely extends from locking means 171. With this embodiment of wire harness 170, this first end of strap 172 and locking means 171 also form a transversely extending groove 181 for receiving intermediate portions of the strap. More specifically, shoulder 178 and strap 172 are spaced aprt and connected together by connecting flange 180, which extends between lower portions of shoulder 178 and strap 172. Key 173 is integrally connected to strap 172 adjacent or near a second end thereof. With wire harness 170, key body 182 extends rearward from a back face of strap 172, and key grip 183 extends forward from a front face of the flexible strap. The first end of flexible strap 172 forms a portion of keyway 184 for receiving key body 182. Here too, preferably this portion of keyway 184 is located directly forward of shoulder 178, which forms a second portion of keyway 184, allowing key 173, specifically key body 182, to be inserted through both strap 172 and shoulder 178. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, key body 182 may be provided with flanges analogous to locking flanges 161 of harness 150, and keyway 184 may be provided with notches analogous to notches 166 of keyway 164, which would cooperate together, just as flanges 161 and notches 166 do, to lock key body 182 within keyway 184. Also, keyway 184 may be formed by a portion of the first end of flexible strap 172 that is not directly forward of shoulder 178. Flexible strap 172 forms a multitude of openings 185 between keyway 184 and key 173 and which have shapes substantially identical to the shape of the keyway. With wire harness 170, strap 172 and key 173 also are supported for movement between an open position shown in Figure 8 , whierein the key is spaced from keyway 184, and a closed position shown in Figure 10 , wherein the key extends within the keyway and connects the first and second ends of the flexible strap together to form a closed loop. With this embodiment, when key 173 and strap 172 are in the closed position, an intermediate portion of the flexible strap extends through groove 181, and the strap and the key ectually form a pair of loops, either or both of which may be used to hold a bundle of wires or another object. In use, toggle arms 175 are forced into a collapsed position and then inserted through an opening. A bundle of wires is gathered together, strap 172 is looped around that budnle, and an intermediate portion of the strap is inserted into groove 181. This may be done, for instance, by simply slipping an intermediate portion of strap 172 downward through the top of groove 181. Strap 172 is positioned so that one of the openings 185 thereof is aligned with keyway 184, and then key body 182 is inserted through the keyway and the aligned strap opening. The length of key body 182 is chosen so that, when the key body is fully inserted through keyway 184, the key engages and securely holds toggle arms 175 in their expanded or over position.
