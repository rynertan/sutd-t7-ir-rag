## Description
CONTROLLING THE MOLECULAR WEIGHT OF POLYBUTADIENE Technical Field This invention relates to the regulation of the molecular weight of a high cis l,4 polybutadiene which has been prepared by polymerizing 1,3 butadiene by means of a catalyst system comprising an aluminum alkyl, soluble nickel salts and a third component which contains fluorine.The third component which contains fluorine should be hydrogen fluoride or hydrogen fluoride complex prepared by reacting hydrogen fluoride with a complexing agent.Background of the Invention Butadiene 1,3 has been polymerized to form high cis 1,4 polybutadiene employing organonickel based catalyst systems and as cocatalyst systems, aluminum alkyl compounds and hydrogen fluoride or a hydrogen fluoride complex. For instance, in the United States Patent 3,856,764 issued December 24, 1974, there is disclosed a process for producing high cis 1,4 polybutadiene which comprises contacting 1,3 butadiene with a catalyst consisting of 1 at least one organoaluminum compound, 2 at least one nickel compound selected from the class consisting.of nickel salts of carboxylic acids, organic complex compounds of nickel and nickel tetracarbonyl, and 3 at least one hydrogen fluoride complex prepared by complexing hydrogen fluoride with one or more members of a class consisting of ketones, esters, ethers, alcohols, nitriles and water. In United States Patent 3,910,869 issued October 7, 1975, there is disclosed another process for the polymerization of 1,3 butadiene to form polymers containing a high proportion of the butadiene units in the cis 1,4 configuration. This process comprises reacting 1,3 butadiene under solution polymerization conditions with a catalyst comprising 1 an organoaluminum compound, 2 an organcnickel compound and 3 hydrogen fluoride. In the process of all of the aforementioned patents 1,3 butadiene is polymerized to a high cis 1,4configuration polybutadiene of fairly high molecular weight in the neighborhood of 3.0 or greater than 3 DSV dilute solution viscosity . There are other United States patents which might be mentioned as producing a high cis l,4 polybutadiene, such as U.S. Patent No. 3,170,907 issued February 23, 1965. There are other patents which utilize aluminum alkyls organonickel compounds, and fluorine containing compounds to produce polybutadienes having various molecular weights and physical properties. See U.S. Patent No. 3,725 492 issued April 3, 1969. In many applications of which cis l,4 polybutadiene can be employed,it is usually desirable to employ a lower molecular weight polymer than those generally obtained from either one of the immediately aforementioned polymerization systems. For example, in the manufacture of tires, particularly automobile tires, it is usually desired to use a high cis 1,4 polybutadiene having a DSV of about 3 or slightly higher. On the other hand, if one desires to use the high cis 1,4 polybutadiene as a sealant or in a paint or some other application other than tires it is usually desirable to have a polybutadiene with a DSV of something less than 3, even to a liquid. The process of the invention described herein deals with the use of various hydrocarbon compounds to regulate the molecular weight of the above mentioned polymerization systems. The utilization of these molecular weight regulators expands the scope of the organoaluminum organonickel fluorine catalyzed 1, 3 butadiene polymerization systems in a manner that the molecular weight of the cis l,4 polybutadiene can be controlled from an extremely high molecular weight elastomer all the way down to a liquid polymer. In the prior art there are syntheses of various molecular weight polybutadienes which can be produced by an anionic or an emulsion polymerization system by controlling the mechanism of the catalyst, the catalyst level or the chain transfer level, respectively. However, these polymerization systems do not necessarily yield a high cis 1,4 polybutadiene typical of the alum inum nickel fluorine base solution polymerization systems mentioned above. As an example, in a typical alkyllithium initiated system, which is anionic in nature, the 1,3butadiene is polymerized generally yielding about 36 to 45 weight percent cis 1,4 polymer, about 48 to 50 percent trans 1,4 polymer and about 8 to 10 percent of the 1,2 structure. Butadiene 1,3 has been polymerized in typical emulsion polymerization systems.These emulsion polymerization systems usually result in the polybutadiene having about 60 percent of the product in the trans l,4 configuration, about 20 percent in the cis 1,4 structure and about 20 percent in the 1,2structure. Very low molecular weight polybutadienes have been synthesized using nickel compounds and aluminum halide compounds in solution polymerization systems. However, these catalyst systems do not yield the very high cis1,4 structure in the polybutadiene which is typical of the nickel carboxylate organoaluminum fluorine containing systems. They furthermore do not have the flexibility to yield high molecular weight polymers. The uniqueness of the present invention is that it expands the scope of the high cis 1,4 directing 1,3butadiene polymerization systems such that they can be employed for the synthesis of the polymers ranging from an elastomer useful in the production of automobile tires to an oily liquid useful in coatings and in other less demanding applications. The effect of certain hydrocarbon compounds on the polymer intrinsic viscosity 7 in 1,3 butadiene polymerization systems employing nickel based catalyst systems was studied by Sakata et al, and reported inDie Makromolekulare Chemie, 139 1970 , pages 73 81. In these studies the authors employed a triethylaluminum nickel carboxylate boron trifluoride etherate catalyst system in benzene solvent. The hydrocarbons screened in this study included saturated hydrocarbons, such as propane, n butane and isobutane. Alpha olefins, such as propylene, butene l and isobutene were studied, as well as internal olefins, such as cis and trans butene 2. Concerted diolefins, such as allene and 1,2 butadiene were tried as hydrocarbons to reduce the molecular weight.Further, acetylenes such as methylacetylene, and vinylacetylene, and nonconjugated diolefins, such as 4 vinylcyclohexene l were attempted to be used as molecular weight regulators. The authors of this paper concluded that saturated hydrocarbons and mono olefins, such as alpha olefins and internal olefins show no effect on the polymer viscosity nor on the conversion. Further, they found that 4 vinylcyclohexene has the effect of lowering the polymer viscosity, however, in order to do so required such amounts as to preclude its employment as a useful molecular weight regulator. The acetylenes did not lower the molecular weight but they did have a very dramatic detrimental effect on polymer yields. In a successful preparation of automobile tires it has been observed that a high cis 1,4 polybutadiene which has a Mooney viscosity of between 50 and 60 is desirable for the proper processing of such polybutadiene into automobile tires. In addition, it has been observed that the proper molecular weight of the polybutadiene is important to provide the properties needed to produce long wearing automobile tires. Summary of the Invention The invention comprises a process for the regulation of the molecular weight of a high cis l,4 polybutadiene prepared by polymerizing 1,3 butadiene in a solution of an aliphatic and or cycloaliphatic or aromatic solvent system employing as a catalyst system a mixture of 1 an organo nickel compound, 2 an organoaluminum compound, and 3 a fluorine containing compound selected from the group consisting of hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen fluoride complexes which are prepared by complexing hydrogen fluoride with a ketone, an aldehyde, a nitrile, a mineral acid containing oxygen, an ester, an ether, an alcohol, a phenol or water said polymerization being conducted in the presence of small amounts of olefins selected from the group consisting of 1 butene, isobutylene, cis and trans 2 butene and allene.

The preferred acid.complexe formed from the mineral acids subgroup and HF is HF 100 phosphoric acid. Water, although in a subgroup by itself, will form at least two hydrate complexes. These are HF H2Q and HF 2H20. Hydrogen fluoride which can be employed alone as the fluorine producing compound in this invention is a limpid liquid which fumes strongly in air, is very poisonous, forms ulcerated sores if it comes in contact with the skin and is very dangerous to handle and to manipulate. Some of these problems can be overcome by complexing the hydrogen fluoride with the complexing agents heretofore mentioned. Some of the advantages obtained by forming the complexes are that they are safer, easier and more accurately measured in the way of handling the hydrogen fluoride component of the catalyst system. Hydrogen fluoride usually complexes to form a complex having a lower vapor pressure, and the complex does not fume as badly as does straight hydrogen fluoride.Hydrogen fluoride boils at 19.7 C, whereas a IZo percent by weight of. a hydrogen fluoride diethylether azeotrope or complex boils at about 740C. When the hydrogen fluoride component is complexed the corrosiveness of the hydrogen fluoride is reduced. The hydrogen fluoride complex can be dissolved in a solvent and thus can be handled and charged to the polymerizat ion system as a liquid solution rather than charging hydrogen fluoride as a gas or a limpid liquid.The solvent which can be employed to solubilize the hydrogen fluoride complex can be any of the inert solvents used as the solvent in the solution polymerization of this invention The complexes of hydrogen fluoride of this invention are usually prepared by simply dissolving the appropriate amount of the complexing agent, for instance a ketone an ester, an ether, an alcohol or a phenol in a suitable solvent and adding the appropriate amount of hydrogen fluoride in a solvent or as a gas or a limpid liquid and mixing in the solvent system. The hydrogen fluoride being soluble in an inert solvent could be dissolved in a solvent separately and the two solvent systems mixed together. Another possible method would be to dissolve either the hydrogen fluoride or the complexing agent in a suitable solvent and then add the remaining components. Another method of mixing would be to dissolve the complexing agent in a solvent and simply bubble gaseous hydrogen fluoride through the system until the complexing agent is reacted fully with the hydrogen fluoride. The amount of complexing agent cannot specifically be set forth. The amount of complexing agent may be a range depending on the conditions of the reaction system, the hydrogen bonding strength of the complexing agent, the size of the complexing agent, or it may be in equilibrium with the hydrogen fluoride complex and the hydrogen fluoride plus the complexing agent. Usually, the complexing agent is employed at a one to one mole ratio with the hydrogen fluoride, but it is possible to use up to 4 moles of HF to 1 mole of complexing agent or up to 4 moles of complexing agent to 1 mole of HF. The three component catalyst system of this invention has polymerization activity over a fairly wide range of catalyst concentrations and catalyst ratios. It is believed that the three catalyst components inter react to form the active catalyst species.As a result, the optimum concentration of any catalyst component is somewhat dependent on the catalyst concentrations of the other two catalyst components.It should be appreciated that while polymerization will occur over a wide range of catalyst concentrations and rations, polybutadiene having the most desirable properties will be obtained within a narrow range of catalyst component concentrations and ratios. Polymerization can occur when the mole ratio of the organoaluminum compounds Al to the nickel salts or nickel complex Ni ranges from about 0.3 1 to about 300 l the mole ratio of the fluorine containing compound F to the organonickel compound Ni ranges from about 0.5 1 to about 500 1 and the mole ratio of the fluorine compound to the organoaluminum compound ranges from about 0.4 1 to about 15 1. However, a more preferred mole ratio of Al Ni ranges from about 2 1 to about 80 1, and a preferred mole ratio of F Ni ranges from about 3 1 to about 150 1 and the preferred mole ratio of F A1 ranges from about 1 1 to about 10 1. The concentration or the amounts of the catalyst components which are employed in the practice of this invention depend on factors such as the purity of the polymerization system, the polymerization rate desired, the temperature employed and other factors. Therefore, specific catalytic concentrations will not be set forth except to state that catalytic amounts of each are employed in the polymerization of this invention. In general, the polymerization of this invention is carried out in an inert solvent system which is aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic in nature. Representative examples of these solvents are pentane, hexane, cyclohexane, butane, benzene and toluene, and the like.The solvent butadiene volume ratio may be varied over a wide range, however, it is usually desired, or more convenient and economical, to use a solvent monomer volume ratio of about 3 1 to about 6 1. This is not to say that higher or even lower solvent monomer volume ratios cannot be employed. It is usually desirable to conduct polymerizations of this invention employing air free and moisture free techniques. The polymerization temperatures employed in the present invention are not critical and may vary from a very low temperature, such as 100C or below, up to a high temperature such as 1000C or higher. However, it is usually more desirable to employ a more conventional temperature from about 300C to 900C. The molecular weight regulators useful in this invention are l butene, isobutylene, cis and trans 2butene and 1,2 propadiene, also referred to as allene.The amounts of molecular weight regulators are generally reported in parts per hundred parts of butadiene in the polymerization system. When allene is employed, it being extremely effective, as little as 0.005 phm shows a reduction in molecular weight. The other mentioned olefins could probably range from 0.01 up to 15 phm. The practice of this invention is further illustrated by reference to the following examples which are representative rather than restrictive of the scope of the invention. Unless otherwise noted, all parts and percentages are by weight. Dilute solution viscosities DSV are or were determined by using approximately 0.25 grams of polymer dissolved in 50 ml of toluene and obtaining the viscosity at 300C. The Mooney viscosity values were determined according to ASTM test D 1646. Example 1 Three different purified premix solutions of butadiene in benzene were prepared. The first contained 100 grams of 1,3 butadiene Bd per liter of solution in benzene the second contained 100 grams Bd and 15 grams of butene l per liter of solution in benzene while the third contained 100 grams Bd and 15 grams of isobutylene per liter of solution in benzene. One hundred milliliters of these solutions were charged into a series of nitrogen flushed 0.118 liter bottles. The butadiene was polymerized by injecting either of two different catalyst levels A or B as shown in Table 1, and then placing the sealed bottles in a water bath maintained at 500C., where they were rotated end over end for either 22 or 18 hours.The polymerizations were terminated by injecting one part per 100 of monomer phm of both a resin acid as a stopper and a phenolic type of antioxidant. The polymers were dried and their dilute solution viscosities were determined as shown in Table 1.

Example 3 Two separate solutions of butadiene 1,3 in hexane were prepared. Twenty five 25 liquid milliliters ofPhillips pure grade l butene was added in place of 25 milliliters of hexane per liter of total solution for the second premix. These solutions were purified by passing through a column of silica gel and then deaerating by sparging with nitrogen. One hundred 100 ml. aliquots of these solutions were charged to a series of 0.118 liter bottles. Each bottle contained nine grams of butadiene.The bottles containing the second premix also contained about 1.35 grams of l butene, or 15 parts per lOOg of butadiene. Separate bottles of each premix solution then were charged by the in situ catalyst addition method with either of two different catalyst systems and with two different ratios of the catalyst components. The catalyst systems charged to each bottle are identified in Table III as catalysts A, B, C or D and the concentrations of each catalyst component is identified in the footnotes to the Table. The catalyst components were triethylaluminum TEAL or triisobutylaluminum TIBAL , nickel octanoate or 2 ethyl hexanoate NiOct and either BF3 or HF dibutyl etherate complex. The polymerizations were conducted at 600C for the times listed in Table III by tumbg end over end in a constant temperature bath.

Premixes containing 100 grams of butadiene per liter of solution in benzene plus the amount of olefinic hydrocarbon indicated in Table IV were dried and deaerated, and 100 ml aliquots were charged to a series of 0.118 liter bottles. Each bottle contained 10 grams of butadiene. No olefinic hydrocarbons were added to Experiment Nos. 1 and 6 listed in Table IV which serve as control experiments to demonstrate the high molecular weight of the polymer normally prepared. One gram of l butene, l.Og of 2 methylpropene isobutylene , 0.5g of cis 2 butene and 0.02g of 1,2 propadiene allene were added to the bottles inExperiment Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively. Polymerization in each bottle was initiated by adding an equal aliquot of a preformed catalyst. The preformed catalyst was prepared as outlined in U.S. Patent No.4,155,880 by dissolving a small amount of butadiene in benzene and then adding triethylaluminum TEAL , nickel octanoate NiOct and HF Et20 complex and permitting the catalyst components to react before injecting the preformed catalyst into the bottles containing lOg of butadiene per 100 ml of solution.
