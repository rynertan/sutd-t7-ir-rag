# ACTUATOR

## Abstract
An actuator, especially for operating a set of pivoted louvres 9 at the mouth of a ventilation duct, comprises a slidable actuating member 1 driven by a bellows 5 . The bellows 5 which is suitably of metal is connected to an electric heating element 6 suitably of p.t.c. material and contains a gas or volatile liquid which generates a pressure inside the bellows in response to a current in the heating element. The actuator is inherently slow acting and therefore quieter than solenoid operated actuators.
