2,4 Dihalo 5 nitrophenyl 4,5,6,7 tetrahydro 2H indazol Verbindung der Formel

## Description
The present invention relates to 2,4 dihalo 5 nitrophenyl 4,5,6,7 tetrahydro 2H indazoles, and their production and use. The said indazoles are representable by the formula These compounds have a strong herbicidal activity against a wide variety of weeds including broad leaved weeds and Graminaceous weeds in agricultural ploughed fields as well as weeds in paddy fields at small doses and do not produce any significant phytotoxicity to various agricultural crops i.e. corn, wheat, soybean, cotton and rice plants . These compounds and their preparation and use are described in our co pending European Patent No. 105 721. The indazole I may be obtained by reacting a 2,4 dihalo 5 substituted phenyl 4,5,6,7 tetrahydro 2H indazole of the formula The 2,4 dihalo 5 substituted phenyl 4,5,6,7 tetrahydro 2H indazole II wherein A is an amino group is obtainable by reacting a 2,4 dihalo 5 nitrophenylhydrazine of the formula The first reaction may be carried out in a solvent at a temperature of 80 to 200 for a period of 0.5 to 20 hours. The 2 alkoxycarbonylcyclohexanone V is usually employed in an amount of 1 to 1.2 equivalents to the substituted phenylhydrazine IX . Examples of the solvent are toluene, xylene, acetic acid, etc. The second reaction is normally carried out in a solvent at a temperature of 80 to 200 C for a period of 5 to 20 hours. The chlorinating agent may be employed in an excess amount to the intermediary product X . Examples of the chlorinating agent are phosphorus oxychloride, thionyl chloride, phosgene, oxalic dichloride, trichloromethyl chloroformate, etc. Examples of the solvent are toluene, xylene, chloroform, etc. The compound of formula XI is then subjected to reduction with an acid e.g. hydrochloric acid or acetic acid and iron powder. Alternatively, the 2,4 dihalo 5 nitrophenyl hydrazine IX may be reacted with 2 acetyl cyclohexanone as in the manner as described above to give a 2,4 dihalo 5 nitrophenyl 4,5,6,7 tetrahydro 2H indazole of the formula The intermediary 2,4 diahlo 5 nitro phenylhydrazine IX , may be produced according to the following scheme The above conversion is known and described in the art. The present invention is further described with reference to the following Examples. Production of the 2,4 dihalo 5 nitrophenyl 4,5,6,7 tetrahydro 2H indazole XI 4 Chloro 2 fluoro 5 nitrophenylhydrazine 4 g , 2 acetylcyclohexanone 2.8 g and a catalytic amount of acetic acid were admixed with xylene 10 ml . The resultant mixture was heated under reflux for 5 hours while removing water. After cooling, the mixture was concentrated and the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography to give 2.3 g of 2 4 chloro 2 fluoro 5 nitrophenyl 3 methyl 4,5,6,7 tetrahydro 2H indazole. M.P., 143 144 C. Production of the 2,4 dihalo 5 nitrophenyl 4,5,6,7 tetrahydro 2H indazole XI A solution of 4 chloro 2 fluoro 5 nitrophenyl hydrazine 4.6 g and 2 ethoxycarbonylcyclohexanone 3.9 g in acetic acid 20 ml was heated under reflux for 4 hours. After cooling, the precipitated crystals were collected by filtration and washed with ether to give 4.2 g of 2 4 chloro 2 fluoro 5 nitrophenyl 2,3a,4,5,6,7 hexahydroisoindazol 3 one. The thus obtained product was added to a lM solution of phosgene in toluene 300 ml and the resultant mixture was heated under reflux for 3 hours. After cooling, the mixture was concentrated and the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography to give 0.8 g of 3 chloro 2 4 chloro 2 fluoro 5 nitrophenyl 4,5,6,7 tetrahydro 2H indazole. M.P., 120 122 C. Production of the nitroaniline XIII 4 Chloro 2 fluoroaniline 23 g was dissolved in conc, sulfuric acid 120 ml , and the resultant mixture was cooled to 20 C, followed by dropwise addition of fuming nitric acid 15 g . The reaction mixture was stirred at 20 to 15 C for 1.5 hours, poured into ice water and then extracted with ether. The ether extract was washed with water and a saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, dried and concentrated. The residue was crystallized from a mixture of toluene and hexane 2 1 to obtain 20 g of 4 chloro 2 fluoro 5 nitroaniline. M.P., 83 84.5 C. In the same manner as in Example 3 but using 4 bromo 2 fluoroaniline, there was obtained 4 bromo 2 fluoro 5 nitroaniline. M.P., 90 92 C.
