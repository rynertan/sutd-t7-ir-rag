# Fluid bearing assembly.

## Abstract
An oscillating pneumatodynamic bearing takes the form of a laminated transducer disc 2 co operating with a flat surface 16 to form a squeeze bearing. A layer 4 of piezoelectric, magnetostrictive or electrostrictive material is laminated with a layer 6 of another material to provide cupping and uncupping of the transducer disc of the bearing when electrically excited by an oscillator 22 , so that the transducer disc is able to fly above the bearing surface on a fluid which is usually ambient air compressed by the mechanical oscillation of the transducer disc at an ultrasonic frequency. The disc is connected mechanically to an object to be supported and to its electrical sources of energy at points along the locus 20 of zero or minimal oscillation. This locus is a nodal circle. A tubular bearing of laminated form has interdigitated electrodes.
