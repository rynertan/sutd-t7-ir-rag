# Single crystal of compound semiconductor of groups III V with low dislocation density.

## Abstract
More than two isoelectronic impurities are doped in a host crystal of compound semiconductors of groups III V. An impurity atom forms a covalent bond with a host atom. Although the real bond length A between an impurity and a host atom in the crystal cannot be measured, it can be surmised from the bond length a between two atoms in a pure two component crystal consisting of the elements same with the impurity atom and the host atom. The bond length between host atoms in the crystal is called standard bond length a₀ . Definite and measurable bond length a replaces the real unknown bond length A . The impurity whose replaced bond length a₁ is shorter than a₀ is called an under impurity. The impurity whose replaced bond length a₂ is longer than a₀ is called an over impurity. In this invention at least one under impurity and at least one over impurity are doped in the host single crystal. From the concentrations x₁ and x₂ , and the replaced bond lengths a₁ and a₂ of the isoelectronic under and over impurities, an arithmetic average
