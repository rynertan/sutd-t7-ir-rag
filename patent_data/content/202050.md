# Combustor liner wall.

## Abstract
A combustor liner wall is provided with an interior wall, an exterior wall and a honeycomb structure disposed therebetween. The honeycomb structure is formed with generally radially aligned cells. The cells are constructed to define alternate array of gaps between the honeycomb structure and the interior and exterior walls, respectively. The cooling air thus undergoes repeated undulations and mixing as it flows through the liner wall.
