# Control of scale formation.

## Abstract
A device for countering the deposition of hard water scale comprises a cathode and an anode defining a passage for water passing through the device and connected in an electrical circuit including the water as an electrolyte. The anode is a sacrificial anode which releases salt particles and ions into the water during operation of the device. At least a substantial proportion of such particles and ions are non adherent to the anode, and thereby form sites for crystal formation in the water and reduce deposition of scale. An external electrical potential may be applied across the circuit to cause an externally generated currant to pass through the device. Means may be provided for generating a magnetic field downstream of the anode and cathode.
