# METHOD OF MANUFACTURING SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE.

## Abstract
A primary object of the present invention is to manufac ture a semiconductor device which has both a high perform ance and a high degree of integration. The method according to this invention comprises the steps of forming a semicon ductor layer 30 , 31 , 31 provided with recesses in its surface, forming a nitride layer 35 within the recesses, forming an oxide layer 39 over the surface of the semicon ductor layer 30 using the nitride layer 35 as a mask, removing the nitride layer 35 , and introducing an impurity into the semiconductor layers 31 , 31 using the oxide layer 39 as a mask. This method makes it possible to form smaller elements, and is most suitable for the manufacture of an IC device which has both a high performance and a high degree of integration.
