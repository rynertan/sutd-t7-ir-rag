# A veneer splicing apparatus.

## Abstract
A veneer splicing apparatus comprising a veneer detec tor for detecting the irregular portions of a veneer 1 disposed before a cutting tool 11 which reciprocates toward and away from conveying means capable of being optionally driven or stopped, with respect to the direction of feeding a veneer 1 a delivery conveyor disposed after the cutting tool veneer supporting members each disposed between the cutting tool 11 and the delivery conveyor with one end thereof directed toward the cutting tool and with the other end thereof pivotally supported an adhesive material feed device to feed adhesive materials, such as adhesive tapes or adhesive impregnated yarns 6 , near to the veneer cutting position of the cutting tool said cutting tool 11 or a tool holder 9 being provided with an appropriate number of guide grooves 12 at an appropriate distance away from the cutting edge of the cutting tool and pressing members 16 integrally mounted on the tool holder on both sides, with respect to the direction of feeding a veneer, of the cutting tool by means of the guide grooves so that the pressing members are capable of being reciprocated toward and away from the veneer cutting position.
