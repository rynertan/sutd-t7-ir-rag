# Microwave oscillator.

## Abstract
A microwave oscillator suitable for millimetre wavelengths comprises a Gunn diode 3 coupled to a wavelength 1 by a resonant cap structure 5,6 . The diode 3 generates microwave energy both at a fundamental frequency f₀ which is below the cut off frequency of the waveguide 1 and at a second harmonic frequency 2f₀ above cut off. To control the generation of microwave energy at 2f₀, energy at f₀ may be coupled into the waveguide 1 , e.g. from an adjacent further waveguide 9 above its cut off, by means of an electric probe 8 extending close to the cap 5 . The probe 8 may couple in a locking signal at or close to the free running value of f₀ from another oscillator having better noise performance and electronic tuning, thereby locking 2f₀ to twice the frequency of the locking signal, or alternatively may couple to a varactor tuned cavity resonant at f₀.
