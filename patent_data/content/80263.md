## Description
Clutch Release Bearing Assembly This invention relates to a clutch release bearing assembly for a pull type friction clutch of a motor vehicle. A typical motor vehicle friction clutch comprises a driven plate which drives the gearbox input shaft, and which is clamped between the engine flywheel and a pressure plate. The pressure plate is biased towards the flywheel by springs and in order to disengage the clutch driven plate, a clutch release bearing assembly acts on a set of release levers to remove the clamp load of the pressure plate from the driven plate. A pull type clutch is one in which the clutch release bearing is moved away from the driven plate. A problem associated with pull type clutches is that the release bearing assembly must usually be fitted to the release levers prior to fitting the transmission to the engine. Since the release fork is pivoted on the transmission casing and yet must engage with the fitted release bearing assembly in order to be able to move the release bearing assembly away from the driven plate it is sometimes difficult to connect the fork with the release bearing assembly. The spring providing the clamp load on the driven plate is typically a diaphragm spring.A typical diaphragm spring is frusto conical in shape and comprises a continuous outer annular portion with a plurality of inwardly projecting fingers. In order to release the clamp load a release load is applied to the radially inner ends of the spring fingers which act as the set of release levers. The release bearing assembly is usually secured to the radially inner ends of the spring fingers prior to assembly of the gearbox in position. The present invention provides a clutch release bearing assembly in which the difficuLties associated with connecting the release fork and the release bearing assembly are alleviated. According to the present invention there is provided a clutch release bearing assembly for use in a vehicle transmission in which a clutch release fork is mounted on a transmission casing, a pull type clutch which includes release levers is mounted on an engine flywheel and the release fork is operably connected to the release levers through the release bearing assembly, the release bearing assembly comprising a rolling element bearing connectable to the clutch release levers, a collar engagable with the release fork and a carrier member connected to the non rotary race of the bearing, wherein the collar and carrier member are axially slidable one relative to the other during assembly of the transmission casing to the engine and the bearing assembly further comprises latch means which locks the collar and the carrier member together for axial movement of the collar and the carrier member in the direction to release the clutch. Preferably the latch means comprises a detent in one of the collar and the carrier member and a spring loaded latch on the other of the collar and the carrier member. The invention will be described by way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Fig. l is a longitudinal section through a clutch release bearing assembly according to the invention, showing also the release fork in elevation and the diaphragm spring fingers Fig. 2 is a section on the line Il Il of Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is a view of the bearing assembly in the direction of arrow A in Fig. 1 and Fig. 4 is a longitudinal section similar to Fig. 1 showing an alternative clutch release bearing assembly according to the invention. With reference to Figs. 1 to 3, the clutch release bearing assembly shown is for a pull type clutch mounted on an engine flywheel and in which in order to release the clutch driven plate not shown a set of release levers in the form of diaphragm spring fingers 25 is moved to the right of Fig. 1, away from the engine flywheel. The release bearing assembly comprises a carrier member in the form of a sleeve 11 having a rolling element release bearing 12 fixed to one end of the sleeve 11 and a detent in the form of a circumferential groove 13 on its radially outer surface at the other end. An annular collar 14 is axially slidable over the said other end portion of the sleeve 11 and has outwardly radially projecting diametrically opposed lugs 15 on its outer periphery for engagement with the ends of a clutch release fork 16 pivoted to the transmission casing not shown . The sleeve 11 is slidable on a guide 18 which is typically a tube surrounding the input shaft. The internal surface of the sleeve 11 has a grease groove 19 therein.The bearing 12 at the one end of the sleeve 11 is located on the driven plate side of the diaphragm spring fingers 25 and is secured to the sleeve through its non rotary race 21 being held in abutment with a shoulder 28 on the sleeve by a clip 22 acting on an oppositely directed shoulder 29. The rotary race 23 is fixed to the spring fingers 25 by another clip 26 and an extension of the rotary race is provided with a curved surface 27 for pivotal movement with the spring fingers 25.The sleeve 11 extends axially through the centre of the spring fingers 25, there being sufficient radial clearance between the bearing non rotary race 21 and the sleeve 11 to accommodate radial re slign ment of the bearing 12 relative to the sleeve 11. The collar 14 comprises an annular carrier of two co axial spaced annular parts 35 joined together through the lugs 15. A pair of radially slidable shutter plates 36 are located in the space between the parts 35 and are arranged on diametrically opposite sides of the collar 14. The two shutter plates 36 are joined together by a pair of tension springs 37 located one at each pair of adjacent ends of the shutter plates and which bias the shutter plates together.The tension springs 37 are located in recesses in the carrier parts 35. The radially inner edges of the two shutter plates 36 are chamfered to co operate with a chamfer 38 on the external surface of the sleeve member 11. The bearing 12 and sleeve member 11 are fitted to the fingers 25 of the diaphragm spring and the collar 14 is fitted onto the clutch release fork 16 prior to fitting the transmission to the engine. The gearbox tube 18 is passed through the centre of the sleeve 11 and the collar 14 fed over the sleeve 11 until the shutter plates 36 contact the chamfer 38 on the end of the sleeve 11. Further axial movement of the transmission casing causes the shutter plates 36 to move radially outwards and ride up the chamfer 38 and then eventually under the bias of the springs 37 to latch with the detent groove 13. During this relative axial movement between the collar 14 and the sleeve 11, the sleeve is held axially in position relative to the spring fingers 25 by the clips 22 and 26 and the bearing 12. During regular operation of the clutch, to release the clutch driven plate the fork 16 is rotated clockwise as seen in Fig. 1 about its pivotP, and the shutter plates 36 engage the detent groove 13 to transfer the release load to the sleeve 11 and bearing 12 and pull the ends of the fingers to the right of Fig. 1, the shutter plates 36 and groove 13 thus acting as latch means which lock the collar 14 and sleeve 11 together for axial movement of the collar in the direction to release the clutch. If it is subsequently desired to separate the transmission casing from the vehicle engine, for example to repair the clutch, the release fork 16 pivots anti clockwise as seen in Fig. I and becomes disengaged from the lugs 15 on the collar 14 as the transmission moves away. The collar 14 can then be removed from the sleeve member Ii by use of a suitable tool and placed onto the release fork 16 for subsequent re assembly. The clutch release bearing assembly shown in Fig. 4 comprises a sleeve 41 having an outwardly projecting radial flange 42 at one end thereof, and has a rolling element bearing 43 secured to its other end portion. An annular collar 44 is axially slidable on a guide comprising a tube 45 surrounding a gearbox input shaft 46.The collar 44 has a pair of diametrically opposed lugs 47 on its outer periphery for engagement with the ends of a clutch release fork 48 pivoted to the transmission casing not shown . The end portion of the collar 44 adjacent to the bearing 43 has a detent in the form of an annular groove 50 in its outer periphery surface. The flange 42 is located on the driven plate side of the clutch diaphragm spring fingers 49 and is held in place by a Belleville spring 51 which reacts against an abutment ring 52 on the sleeve 41. The rotary race of the bearing 43 is secured to the other end of the sleeve 41 and is held in position against the other side of the ring 52 to the spring 51, by a circlip 53. The non rotary race 59 of the bearing 43 is held by a circlip 56 against a shoulder 55 within the mouth of a cup shaped carrier member 54. A spring washer 57 biasses the bearing outer race towards the circlip 56 which is abutted by an L section ring 58. The base 64 of the cup shaped carrier member 54 has a bore through which the input shaft 46, tube 45, and surrounding collar 44, all pass.A pair of radially slidable shutter plates 66 is located in an annular groove 65 which projects radially outwards from the inner surface of the bore in the base 64 and are arranged on diametrically opposite sides of the collar 44. The two shutter plates 66 are joined together by a pair of tension springs not shown located one at each pair of adjacent ends of the shutters and which bias the shutters together. The springs are located in recesses in the base 64 of the carrier member 54.The tension springs and shutter plates 66 are generally as the tension springs 37 and shutter plates 36 described with reference to Figs. 1 to 3. The end of the collar 44 adjacent to the bearing 43 has a chamfer 68 to co operate with the shutter plates 66 when the transmission is mated with the engine. When the transmission casing is offered up to the vehicle engine the bearing 43, sleeve 44 and carrier member 54 have all been previously fitted to the fingers 49 of the diaphragm spring, and the collar 54 has been previously fitted onto the clutch release fork 58. The gearbox input shaft 46 and tube 45 are passed through the bore in the base 64 of the carrier member 54 and the collar 44 is fed through the carrier member until the shutter plates 66 contact the chamfer 68 on the collar. Further axial movement of the transmission casing causes the shutter plates 66 to move radially outwards and ride up the chamfer 68 and then eventually under the bias of the tension springs to latch into the detent groove 50 on the collar 44.During this relative axial movement between the collar 44 and the carrier member 54, the carrier member is held axially in position relative to the spring fingers 49 by the ring 52, clip 56, and Belleville spring 51. During regular operation of the clutch, to release the clutch driven plate the fork 48 is rotated clockwise relative to Fig. 4 about its pivot P, and the shutter members 66 engage the detent groove 50 to transfer the release load to the bearing 43 and sleeve 41 so as to pull the ends of the fingers 49 towards the right ofFig. 4, the shutter plates 66 and groove 50 thus acting as latch means which lock the collar 44 and carrier member 54 together for axial movement of the collar in the direction to release the clutch. If it is subsequently desired to separate the transmission casing and the vehicle engine, for example to repair the clutch, the release fork 48 is allowed to pivot anti clockwise and disengage from the lugs 47 on the collar 44 as the transmission casing moves away. The collar 44 can then be removed from the carrier member 54 by use of a suitable tool and placed onto the release fork 48 for subsequent re assembly.
