# APPARATUS FOR REPRODUCING AUDIO SIGNALS WITH AUTOMATIC CONTROL OF THE MAXIMUM OUTPUT VOLUME

## Abstract
An audio signal reproducing apparatus comprises a final stage 6,7 controlled by the output 5 of a volume control device 2 having a first and a second input controlled respectively by the audio signals and a control signal. The control device transfers the audio signals to its output 5 at a volume which is proportional to the magni tude of the control signal. The output of said control device is compared to a reference voltage in a comparator 11 the output of which controls the second input of the volume control device.
