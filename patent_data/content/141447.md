# Loudspeaker system and loudspeaker for converting an n bit digitized electric signal into an acoustic signal.

## Abstract
An electrodynamic transducer 1 for use in a loudspeak er system for converting an n bit digitized electric signal 11 into an acoustic signal comprises n voice coil devices 4.1, 4.2, ... 4.n which cooperate with a magnet system 3 . The voice coil devices each comprise a conductor whose length is the same for all the voice coil devices. The areas of the perpendicular cross sections of the conductors increase each time by a factor of two starting from the voice coil device 4.n corresponding to the least significant bit and going to voice coil devices corresponding to consecutive more signi ficant bits. In accordance with the invention steps are proposed which enable such a transducer to be constructed in a simple manner if the transducer is a moving coil loudspeaker or if the transducer is a ribbon type loudspeaker.
