# Bursting disc orientation device.

## Abstract
A bursting disc orientation device comprises a cut away portion 7 on a predetermined one collar 2 of the bursting disc unit and cooperable with the cut away portion, a projection 8 e.g. in the form of an arm of an angle bracket 9 secured to the periphery, or integral therewith, of that pipe flange 5 against which the said one collar 2 is required to bear. Thus, the unit can be prevented from being located between the pipe flanges of the bursting disc unit in other than a predetermined orientation in which the projec tion 8 is located in the cut away portion 7 . This improves the safety of the device.
