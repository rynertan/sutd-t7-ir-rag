# Production of isopropylbenzene.

## Abstract
Benzene is brought into contact with propylene, in the presence of a specified type of crystalline zeolite catalyst, to produce isopropylbenzene selectively. The zeolite has a silica to alumina ratio of at least 12 and a constraint index within the approximate range of 1 12. The process may be carried out in the liquid or the vapor phase at temperatures of from about 100 C to about 300 C and pressures ranging from 10⁵N m² to 6 x 10⁶ N m². The preferred zeolite is ZSM 12. Recycle of polyisopropylbenzenes is provided for.
