## Abstract
Membrane forming polymeric systems, which comprise the molecular association product of a polymeric carboxylic acid having at least 10 of the monomer units containing free carboxylic groups with an ethoxylated nonionic surfactant, allow the release of volatile and water soluble active agents at a controlled, uniform rate and over a prolonged period of time into the environment of use.
