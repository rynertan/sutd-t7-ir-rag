# A SCREENING APPARATUS

## Abstract
A screening apparatus includes a conveyor 10 pivotally mounted at its rear end on a wheeled chassis 2 . The conveyor 10 includes a rear section 12 and a forward section 14 telescopically connected to the rear section 12 . An endless belt 16 is guided and powered by spaced rollers 18 mounted on the conveyor rear and forward sections 12 and 14 . The conveyor 10 is moved between its operational and transporting positions by a jacking cylinder 20 . A screen device 30 is pivotally coupled to the output stage of the forward section 14 , and is controlled by a ram 36 . A hopper 8 for receiving the material to be separated is mounted on the chassis 2 . To convert the apparatus from its operational position to its transporting position, the jacking cylinder 20 lowers the conveyor 10 , two sets of troughing rollers 38 are removed from the forward section 14 , and the ram 36 is disconnected from the forward section 14 . This forward section 14 is partially telescoped into the rear section 12 , and the screen device 30 is pivoted clockwise and bolted to the rear section 12 .
