## Description
COMPOUND SEMICONDUCTOR LAYER HAVING HIGH CARRIER CONCENTRATION AND METHOD OF FORMING SAME BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1 Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a compound semiconductor layer, such as gallium arsenide GaAs and aluminum gallium arsenide AlGaAs , formed by a molecular beam epitaxy MBE process. More particularly, it relates to a doping method for a compound semiconductor layer having a high carrier concentration. 2 Description of the Related Art A compound semiconductor such as GaAs has a carrier mobility higher than that of a silicon Si semiconductor widely used for semiconductor devices, so a compound semiconductor contributes toward high speed operation of semiconductor devices comprising field effect transistors FET s or bipolar transistors.Furthermore, in an optical semiconductor device, such as a laser and a photo diode, compound semiconductors, such as GaAs and AlGaAs, are used for forming a suitable energy band condition corresponding to a desired light. The MBE process can be used to form i.e., grow a compound semiconductor layer of a semiconductor device, such as a low noise Schottky barrier GaAs FET for microwaves, a high electron mobility transistor HEMT , and a GaAs AlGaAs double heterojunction laser, because the MBE process can provide the device with a properties superior to those by the liquid phase epitaxy LPE process or vapor phase epitaxy process. The dopant i.e., impurity for making the compound semiconductor, such as GaAs and AlGaAs, anN type conductivity is Si, germanium Ge , tin Sn , sulfur S , selenium Se , or tellurium Te . The use of S, Se, or Te of group VI involves the use of a compound thereof. Ge can make the compound semiconductor a P type conductivity depending upon growth conditionsSn cannot easily form a donor profile with a sharp reduction. Therefore, Si is usually used. Other dopants making the compound semiconductor a P type conductivity is beryllium Be , magnesium Mg , manganese Mn , or zinc Zn . Be is usually used. A compound semiconductor layer e.g., a GaAs layer formed by the MBE process can be doped with a dopant by the following methods. First, when the GaAs layer is grown on a GaAs substrate by bombarding the substrate with a Ga molecular beam and an As molecular beam, an Si or Be molecular beam impinges on the substrate, so that the obtainedGaAs layer is uniformly doped with Si or Be. The growing and the doping are simultaneously carried out, for example, under the following conditions a temperature of the GaAs substrate of 5000C to 700 C, a temperature of an effusion cell for As of 3000C to 4000C, a temperature of an effusion cell for Ga of 900or to 1100 C, and a temperature of an effusion cell for Si or Be of 11000C to 13500C or l1000C to 13500C , The GaAs layer is formed at a growth rate of approximately 0.5 umZh. The formed N type GaAs layer doped with Si has a carrier electron concentration density N of up to 7 x 1018 cm 3. Although the Si doping concentration can be increased, the maximum value of 7 x 1018 cm is not increased because of lowering of an activation coefficient of doped Si. The formed P type GaAs layer doped with Be has a carrier hole concentration density N of up to 5 x 1019 cm 3. Although the Be doping concentration can be increased, the maximum value of 5 x 1019 cm is not increased because of the reduction of the activation coefficient of the doped Be. Second, a GaAs MBE layer is doped with a dopant Ge by a so called atomic plane doping process cf. C.E.C. Wood et al Complex free carrier profile synthesis by t atomic plane doping of MBE GaAs, J. Appl.Phys. Vol. 51, No. 1 1980 , pp. 383 387 . In this case, the growth of the GaAs layer is suspended by stopping the Ga molecular beam i.e., closing an effusion cell for Ga by a shutter and simultaneously making the dopant molecular beam impinge on the GaAs surface, so that the dopant atoms are accommodated in a virtually flat single atomic plane. Then, the dopant molecular beam is stopped and the Ga molecular beam is resumed to grow the GaAs layer. The formation of the atomic plane is repeated and the Ga atomic planes are introduced into a grown GaAs layer. The GaAs MBE layer including Ga atomic planes attains a carrier concentration N on the 1017cm 3 order of 1 x 1017 cm Third, the doping of the dopant into the GaAsMBE layer can be carried out by a conventional ion implantation method.The implanted dopant atoms are activated and crystal defects are corrected by annealing at a temperature of from 8000C to 850or. In this case, the activation coefficient of implanted dopant atoms is low, so that the carrier concentration N is lower than with the above mentioned doping manners. For example, the obtained carrier electron concentration N of theGaAs layer doped with Si can attain the maximum value 18 18 3 range of 1 x 10 2 x 10 cm SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to increase a carrier concentration of a compound semiconductor e.g.,GaAs layer. Another object of the present invention is to provide a compound semiconductor layer formed by the MBE process and having a high carrier concentration and a method of forming it. A still other object of the present invention is to improve properties of a semiconductor device comprising a compound semiconductor layer which has an increased carrier concentration, resulting in decreased resistants e.g., a resistant of the compound semiconductor layer itself and a contact resistant and an increased electric current. The above mentioned and other objects of the present invention are attained by providing a compound semiconductor layer of GaAs or AlGaAs having atomic planes of dopant therein, each of the atomic planes 12 a sheet dopant concentration N sd of 2 x 1O12 2 having a sheet dopant concentration Nsd of 2 x l012 cm or more and an interval between the atomic planes from each other of 6 nm or less. The compound semiconductor GaAs or AlGaAs is formed by the MBE process and by repeated atomic plane doping in the course of the MBE growth, according to the present invention, the atomic plane doping being carried out by using a molecular beam of a dopant at a sheet dopant concentration Nsd of 2 x 10 cm or more at intervals of 6 nm or less. It is preferable to carry out the atomic plane doping by suspending the growth of GaAs or AlGaAs by stopping the molecular beam of Ga and molecular beam of Al and simultaneously by bombarding the surface of the growing GaAs or AlGaAs layer with a molecular beam of a dopant Si or Be to attain the desired dopant sheet concentration of the atomic plane. It is possible to carry out the atomic plane doping by bombarding the surf ace of the growing GaAs or AlGaAs layer with a strong molecular beam of a dopant in a short term without suspending the MBE growth. It is preferable that a N type GaAs or AIGaAs layer incorporate Si atomic planes each of which has a sheet Si concentration Nsd of 2 x 1012 cm or more and is spaced from the next by 6 nm or less. The Si sheet concentration and the interval distance between neighboring atomic planes can be controlled so as to obtain a carrier electron concentration N of the N type GaAs 18 3 AlGaAs layer of 7 x 10 cm or more. It is also preferable that an P type GaAs AlGaAs layer incorporate Be atomic planes of 5 x 10 cm or more at intervals of 4 nm or less. The Be sheet concentration and the interval can be controlled so as to obtain a carrier hole concentration of the P type GaAs 19 layer or 5 x 1O19 3 AlGaAs layer of 5 x 10 9 cm3 or more. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The present invention will become more apparent from the description of the preferred embodiments set forth below with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figs. la to lc are schematic views of arrangements of atoms forming a GaAs layer Fig. 2 is a graph showing a relationship between a sheet dopant Si concentration N sd and a sheet electron concentration N of an N type GaAs S layer incorporating an Si atomic plane Fig. 3 is a graph showing the relationship between a sheet dopant Be concentration N sd and a sheet hole concentration N of a P type GaAs layer S incorporating a Be atomic plane Fig. 4 is a graph showing the relationship between the interval between Si atomic planes and carrier electron concentration N of an N type GaAs layer incorporating 20 Si atomic planes and Fig. 5 is a graph showing the relationship between interval between Be atomic planes and the carrier hole concentration N of a P type GaAs layer incorporating 20 Be atomic planes. DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Before describing the preferred embodiments of the present invention, atomic plane doping is explained. Referring to Figs. la to Ic, atomic plane doping ofSi into a GaAs MBE layer is carried out in the following manner. A 100 GaAs substrate has grown on it a GaAs layer by bombarding it with a Ga molecular beam and an As molecular beam simultaneously. When the Ga molecular beam is stopped with the As bombardment continued, the growth of the GaAs layer is suspended and an As surface appears, as shown in Fig. la. An Si molecular beam impinges on the As surface of the growing GaAs layer, so that Si atoms occupy some of the Ga sites, as shown inFig. lb. Then, the Si molecular beam is stopped and theGa molecular beam is resumed, so that GaAs is grown, as shown in Fig. lc. A plane comprising Si atoms is called an atomic plane According to the present invention, this atomic plane doping is repeated and the dopant sheet concentra tiofr of each atomic plane and the interval between neighboring atomic planes are defined. Next, the relationship between a sheet dopant Si concentration Nsd i.e. , a doping amount of an atomic plane and a sheet electron concentration N is S discussed. A 100 GaAs substrate, a Ga effusion cell, an As effusion cell of Si effusion cell are set in an MBE apparatus. The MBE apparatus is evacuated to a high vacuum, and the substrate and the effusion cells are heated to prescribed temperature. For example, substrate temperature is 520GC 500 C to 7000C , the Ga effusion cell temperature is l000 C t500 C to tlOG C , the As effusion cell temperature is 330 C 3000C to 4000C , and the Si effusion cell temperature is 1300 C 11000C to 13500C . Each of the effusion cells is provided with a shutter which intercepts a molecular beam from the effusion cell. A shutter of the As effusion cell is opened to allow the As molecular beam to impinge on the GaAs substrate. The substrate is cleaned by the As molecular beam. The shutter keeps on opening to continue the bombarding of the As molecular beam i.e., As atoms until the end of the GaAs layer formation. Then, a shutter of the Ga effusion cell is open to allow the Ga molecular beam to impinge, so that an undoped GaAs epitaxial layer having a thickness of approximately 0.4 pm is grown at a growth rate of approximately 0.6 vm h on the substrate. In order to perform Si atomic plane doping, the Ga molecular beam is stopped by closing the shutter of theGa effusion cell to suspend the GaAs growth, and a shutter of the Si effusion cell is opened to allow theSi molecular beam to impinge on the growing GaAs layer.The Si atoms adhere to the As surface of the GaAs layer, as shown in Fig. lb. At this time, the intensity of theSi molecular beam is controlled by adjusting the Si effusion cell temperature and the time for opening theSi cell shutter is controlled, so that the given sheetSi concentration i.e., the prescribed number of Si atoms at an atomic plane is attained. Then, the Si cell shutter is closed and the Ga cell shutter is reopened, so that the Ga molecular beam impinges together with the As molecular beam on the GaAs layer to restart the growth of an undoped GaAs layer having a thickness of approximately 0.1 pom . Thus each of the obtained GaAs MBE layers having a thickness of approximately 0.5 pm incorporates only oneSi atomic plane having various sheet Si dopant concentrations Nsd The sheet carrier electron concentrations N of the GaAs layers are determined by Hall measurements S and capacity voltage C V measurements. The results of the measurements at 300 K 270C are shown in Fig. 2.The broken line in Fig. 2 indicates the activation coefficient of 100 . As shown in Fig. 2, Si atoms of up to 3 x 10 cm are completely activated. As the sheet Si concentration N sd increases, the sheet electron concentration N increases, but the activation coeffi 5 12 2 cient at N sd above3 x 10 cm 2 decreases and would reach a saturated value. The relationship between a sheet Be concentrationNsd and a sheet hole concentration N5 is discussed. In the above mentioned MBE growth of the GaAs layer, the effusion cell for Si is replaced with an effusion cell for Be for performing Be atomic plane doping. GaAs layers are formed under the above mentioned conditions, so that each of the obtained GaAs MBE layers incorporates only one Be atomic plane having various sheet Be concentrations Nsd. The sheet carrier hole concentrations N of the GaAs layers are determined by S Hall measurements. The results of the measurements at 300 K are shown in Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 3, Be atoms of upto 1.3 x 1014 cm are almost completely activated. A compound semiconductor MBE layer e.g., GaAs layer having a high carrier concentration is formed in accordance with the present invention. Example 1 A GaAs layer doped with Si by forming 20 Si atomic planes is produced in the following manner. In an MBE apparatus, a 100 GaAs substrate is heated at approximately 520 GO, and an As molecular beam impinges on the substrate. These conditions are maintained. A Ga molecular beam impinges on the substrate to grow an undoped GaAs layer having a thickness of approximately 0.4 um at a growth rate of approximately 0.6 vm h. The Ga molecular beam is stopped to suspend the GaAs growth, and an Si molecular beam impinges on the GaAs layer to form an atomic plane. A sheet Si concentration N d of the atomic plane of 2 x 1012 cm 2, 12 2 12 2 3 x 10 cm , or 5 x 10 cm 2 is attained by controlling the intensity and impinging time of the Si molecular beam. Then the Si molecular beam is stopped and the Ga molecular beam reimpinges to continue growing the GaAs layer. After the additional GaAs portion having a prescribed thickness e.g., 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2, 3, d, 4.5 or 7 nm is grown on the atomic plane, the Ga molecular beam is stopped to resuspend the GaAs growth.The above mentioned Si atomic plane doping is repeated.Thus, alternate Si atomic doping and additional GaAs portion growth are performed. After the 20th Si atomic plane doping, the final GaAs portion having a thickness of approximately 0.1 pm is grown. The obtained GaAs layer incorporates 20 Si atomic planes at constant intervals. The electron concentration N of the GaAs layer is determined by Hall measurements at 300 K. The results of the measurements are shown in Fig. 4. Solid curve lines A, B, and C indicate GaAs layers with Si atomic planes of 2 x 10 , 3 x 10 , and 5 x 10 cm respectively. Broken curve lines indicate calculated values.As can be seen from Fig. 4, in order to obtain a GaAs MBE layer having an electron concentration N of 19 3 0.7 x 1019 cm 3 or more, when the sheet Si concentration Nsd is 2 x 10lot 3 x 1012, and 5 x 1012 cm , the interval between Si atomic planes is 2.5 nm or less, 4.0 nm or less, and 6 nm or less, respectively. Example 2 A GaAs layer doped with Be by forming 20 Be atomic planes is produced in the following manner. A 100 GaAs substrate has grown thereon an undopedGaAs layer having a thickness of approximately 0.4 um under the same conditions as in Example 1. During the suspension of GaAs growth due to the stopping of the Ga molecular beam, a Be molecular beam impinges on the GaAs layer to form an atomic plane having a sheet Be concentration Nsd of 2 x l0 cm Then, the Be molecular beam is stopped and the Ga molecular beam reimpinges to continue growing the GaAs layer. After the additionalGaAs portion having a prescribed thickness e.g., 0.5, 1.0, 2, 5, 10, or 20 nm is grown on the atomic plane, the GaAs growth is resuspended by stopping of the Ga molecular beam. Such Be atomic plane doping and the additional GaAs portion growth are alternated.After the 20th Be atomic plane doping, the final GaAs portion having a thickness of approximately 0.1 vm is grown.The obtained GaAs layer incorporates 20 Be atomic planes at constant intervals. The average hole concentration N of the GaAs layer is determined by Hall measurements at 300 K. The results of the measurements are shown inFig. 5. As can be seen from Fig. 5, the hole concentration is inversely proportional to the interval between the Be atomic planes. In order to obtain a GaAs MBE 19 3 layer having a hole concentration N of 5 x 10 cm or more, when the sheet Be concentration N is 2 x 1013 cm , the interval is 4.0 nm or less.When the interval is 0.5 nm, the sheet Be concentration Nsd 20 3 reaches 2.8 x 10 cm be concluded that when the sheet Be concentration is small, the intervals are narrowed to attain a given hole concentration N, while when the sheet Be concentration is large, the intervals are widened. Therefore, by the adoption of suitable intervals for the Be atomic planes 12 2 having a sheet Be concentration of 5 x 10 cm 2 the given hole concentration can be attained. It will be obvious that the present invention is not restricted to the above mentioned embodiments and that many variations are possible for persons skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, it is possible to dope anAlGaAs MBE layer with Si or Be. For example, an AlGaAs MBE layer is formed in a semiconductor device utilizing a two dimensional electron gas 2DEG , e.g., a high electron mobility transistor HEMT , as an electron supply layer.A HEMT has a spacer layer of undopedAIGaAs between an undoped GaAs active layer and an electron supply layer of n type AlGaAs According to the prior art, e.g., the undoped AlGaAs spacer layer has a thickness of 6 nm, the n type AlGaAs layer has a 18 3 doping Si concentration of 2 x 10 cm , and the sheet electron concentration of a 2DEG layer generated at the interface of undoped AlGaAs spacer layer and the 11 active layer is 6 x I 1011 2GaAs active layer is 6 x 10 cm . The Si atomic plane doping technique can be applied on the undopedAlGaAs spacer layer. During the growth of the AlGaAs spacer layer, a Ga molecular beam and an Al molecular beam are stopped to suspend the AlGaAs growth. A Si molecular beam impinges on the AlGaAs surface to form aSi atomic plane, and then the AlGaAs growth restarted. For example, the total thickness of the undoped AlGaAs layer is 12 nm and the Si atomic plane is formed at the center of the AlGaAs layer and has a sheet Si concentra 12 2 tion of 2 x 10 cm 2 In this case, a sheet electron concentration of a 2DEG layer can attain to 12 2 1 x 10 cm Thus, the Si atomic plane doping can increase the doping dopant amount of an AlGaAs layer for an electron supply layer. Therefore, where such Si atomic plane doping is repeated i.e., Si atomic planes are formed in an AlGaAs layer, the average dopant Si concentration is further increased with result that an electric resistant of the AlGaAs layer is decreased and an electron carrier concentration is increased.
