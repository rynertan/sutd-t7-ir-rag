# Scanning light system.

## Abstract
A scanning light source system for projecting onto each area of a complete painting or other planar subject 120 a beam of light and for moving said beam vertically and hori zontally. The vertical movements comprise a succession of sweeps across the painting for the purpose of consecutively illuminating each part of the painting sufficiently strongly so that the whole may be photographically reproduced more satisfactorily than has been possible heretofore, e.g., through the use in combination of Kodak No. 6121 duplicat ing film or another gamma 1.0 film, polarizing filters, and a lens aperture of f22 or smaller. The horizontal movements take place on horizontal rails 20, 21 and position the light source 2 for each vertical sweep. The vertical movements, controlled by motor 70 , position a frame, which includes rails 20, 21 , light source 2 and reflector 5 , on uprights 125 .
