# Peptide type substrates useful in the quantitative determination of endotoxin.

## Abstract
Disclosed are chromogenic or fluorogenic peptide type compounds adapted for use in determining endotoxin in a sample by a Limulus amebocyte lysate type assay. The compounds have the general formula R₁ A₁ A₂ A₃ A₄ B R₂ wherein R₁ represents hydrogen, a blocking aromatic hydro carbon or acyl A₁ represents an L or D amino acid selected from either Ileu, Val or Leu A₂ represents Glu or Asp A₃ represents Ala or Cyst A₄ represents Arg, B represents a linkage group selected from ester and amide linkage groups and R₂ represents a chromogenic or fluorogenic group which is covalently attached to the C carboxyl terminal of arginine through the B linkage group and which yields a chromophor ic or fluorescent marker compound of the formula R₂ B H upon enzymatic hydrolysis from the remainder of the peptide type compound by activated LAL pro clot enzyme. Also disclosed are methods for the determination of endoto xin in a sample by contacting the sample with a pro clotting enzyme from Limulus amebocyte lysate and one of the above chromogenic or fluorogenic peptide type compounds.
