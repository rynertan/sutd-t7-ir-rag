# Fabrication of a printed circuit board with metal filled channels.

## Abstract
A plastic substrate 20 is injection molded to provide a pattern of channels 22 . The substrate is metallized through one or more steps of flame spraying, electroless plating, electroplating, gas plating or vacuum deposition. The result ing metallization is abraded down to the non channel surfaces, leaving a conductive pattern of metal filled chan nels. In another form of the invention, the non channel surfaces of the substrate are first coated with a suitable resist. The portions of the substrate may then be chemically removed.
