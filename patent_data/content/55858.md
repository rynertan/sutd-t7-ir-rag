## Description
PHOTOGRAPHIC PRODUCTS, DIFFUSION TRANSFERPHOTOGRAPHIC PROCESS, AND COMPOUNDS USED THEREFOR BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis application relates generally to photography and, more specifically, to diffusion transfer photographic systems including products and processes.Diffusion transfer photographic systems wherein images are formed in colour by the use of image dye providing materials such as dye developers are well known in the art.Generally, multicolour transfer images are formed by processing an exposed multicolour photosensitive silver halide element with an aqueous alkaline processing composition distributed between two sheet like elements, one of these elements including an image receiving layer. The processing composition is so applied and confined within and between the two sheet like elements as not to contact or wet outer surfaces of the two superposed elements, thus providing a film unit whose external surfaces are dry. The processing composition preferably is distributed in viscous form from a pressure rupturable container.It is known in the art to carry out development in the presence of development restrainers whereby development of exposed silver halide is continued for a period of time sufficient to form an imagewise distribution of diffusible unoxidized dye developers in undeveloped areas of the silver halide emulsion layers with the unoxidized dye developers being transferred by diffusion to a superposed image receiving element and, after the predetermined development period restraining further development of exposed silver halide by means of the development restrainer. See, for example, U.S. Patent 3,265,498.Various development restrainers which are useful for such purposes are known including mercaptoazoles such as 1 phenyl 5 mercaptotetrazole. However, the use of such development restrainers is subject to certain limitations.For example, U.S. Patent 3,260,597 discloses that mercaptoazole development restrainers or arrestors , such as l phenyl 5 mercaptotetrazole, can not be used in the aqueous alkaline processing composition in any appreciable amount because development of exposed silver halide will be stopped prematurely particularly in the outer blue and green sensitive emulsion layers of a multicolour system.It is also known in the art to use blocked development restrainers which are designed to provide a timed release of a development restrainer during the development process.See, for example, U.S. Patent 3,698,898 which discloses the use of quinone or naphthoquinone methide precursors which release a photographic reagent such as 1 phenyl 5mercaptotetrazole in the presence of alkali U.S.. patent 4,009,029 which discloses a class of cyanoethyl containing blocked development restrainers German Offenlegungsschrift 2,427,183 which discloses various blocked development restrainers, and U.S. Patents 3,260,597 and 3,265,498, referred to above, which disclose hydrolyzable blocked restrainers.The use of phenylmercaptotetrazole compounds which are substituted on the phenylring as development inhibitors in certain conventional photographic systems is also known. See, for example, Research Disclosure, July 1974, page 12, and U.S. Patent 3,295,976. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present application relates to a diffusion transfer photographic system wherein the development process is carried out in the presence of phenylmercaptoazoles which are. substituted on the phenyl ring.It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a novel diffusion transfer photographic system.It is another object to provide a diffusion transfer photographic system wherein development of an exposed photosensitive element is carried out in the presence of phenylmercaptoazole compounds which are substituted on the phenyl ring.It is a further object to provide such a diffusion transfer photographic system wherein the compounds utilized include a blocking group designed to provide a timed release of the substituted phenylmercaptoazoles during the development process.Yet another object is to provide a diffusion transfer photographic process wherein the pH of the processing composition initially is substantially equal to or greater than thiKa of the substituent on the phenyl ring of the phenylmercaptoazole compound and subsequently, during development, the pH is lowered below the pRa. Still another object is to provide a diffusion transfer photographic system wherein the substituted phenylmercaptoazole compounds may be incorporated in the aqueous alkaline processing composition.A further object is to provide a diffusion transfer photographic system wherein the substituted phenylmercapt tetrazole compounds may be incorporated in the photosensitive element.Yet another object is to provide a diffusion transfer photographic system wherein the photographic speed.of one or more silver halide emulsions may be increased.A still further object is to provide a diffusion transfer photographic system wherein fog development may be decreased.Another object is to provide novi colour diffusion transfer photographic products and process. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThese and other objects and advantages are accomplished in accordance with the invention by providing a diffusion transfer photographic system wherein development of an exposed photosensitive element with an aqueous alkaline processing composition is carried out in the presence of compounds which are represented by the formulaEMI4.1 wherein X represents the nonmetallic atoms necessary to form a nucleus which completes a 5 or 6 membered heterocyclic moiety on said structure including substituted rings and fused rings R is H, an alkali metal or a group which is cleavable in a photographic aqueous alkaline processing composition and R1 is either a group which has a pKa of from about 7 to about 14 which is ionizable to an anion, preferably about 8.5 or above, whereby the silver salt of the mercaptan resulting from cleavage orjionization of SR is rendered more soluble in the pH range within which R1 is ionized to an anion than it is below that pH range, or a precursor of such a group. The compounds which are useful according to the invention are generally phenylmercaptoazoles wherein the substituted phenyl moiety is attached to either a nitrogen atom or a carbon atom of the azole moiety. Accordingly, the compounds may be represented by either of the following formulas which are both within generic Formula A.EMI5.1 The heterocyclic moieties formed by X preferably include those wherein the heterocyclic atoms i.e., atoms other than carbon are members of a single heterocyclic ring as contrasted with compounds containing fused or condensed heterocyclic rings in which the heterocyclic atoms are members of more than one heterocyclic ring. Typical suitable compounds include monoazoles such as benzoxa2sSes benzothiazoles, etc. diazoles such as benzimidazoles tr azoles such as 1,2,4 triazoles, etc. tetrazoles and prior idines. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the compounds include a tetrazole nucleus.The substituent R1 on the phenyl moiety may be either any suitable substituent which has a pKa of from about 7 to about 14 which is ionizable to an anion whereby the silver salt of the mercaptan resulting from cleavage or ionization of SR is rendered more soluble in the pH range within which R1 is ionized to an anion than it is below that pH range, or a precursor of such a substituent.Typical suitable substituents are EMI6.1 where Z is H, alkyl having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, aralkyl such as benzyl or phenethyl, phenyl or substituted phenyl.The compounds within generic formula A wherein R1 isEMI6.2 are novel compounds.As stated previously, the compounds may include a mercaptan group attached to a carbon atom of the azole nucleus or may include a blocking group attached to the sulfur atom with the blocking group designed to cleave from the molecule in an aqueous alkaline medium to provide a timed release of the desired phenylmercaptoazole compound. WhereR is a blocking group it may be any suitable blocking group such as, for example, those which cleave by hydrolysis those which cleave by quinone methide elimination e.g.,EMI7.1 such as disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,698,898 those which cleave by hydrolysis followed by quinone methide elimination e.g., R isEMI7.2 and those which cleave by i3 elimination e.g.R is CH2 CH2 CN, EMI7.3 suitable blocking groups include, for example,EMI7.4 and succinimido groups which are substituted on the nitrogen atom with alkyl or aryl as disclosed in U.S.patent 3,888,677. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, R is bM, CX,SO,R5 where R5 is alkyl, aryl or substituted aryl.Cleavage of the blocking group in aqueous alkaline medium releases, in a timed fashion during development, the substituted phenylmercaptoazole moiety. Cleavage of the blocking group occurs according to the following reaction sequence EMI8.1 where R is R minus a proton. The rate of release of the substituted phenylmercaptoazole moiety is temperature dependent, that is, more is released as the temperature at which processing of the film unit is effected rises. Thus, more of the substituted phenylmercaptoazole moiety is made available at elevated temperatures, i.e., above room temperature, where more is typically desired, less is released at room temperature and even less below room temperature where lesser amounts are needed.Thus, these blocked compounds which are utilized according to the invention provide more uniform sensitometry for the film units of the invention over a wide temperature range of processing. In other words, the sensitometry of the film units which include such blocked compounds according to the invention is less temperature dependent than would otherwise be the case.The compounds which are useful according to the invention have been found to modify and or control the sensitometry when present during diffusion transfer processing of an exposed photosensitive element, particularly when such processing is carried out at elevated temperatures, e.g., at about 350C. Such modification and or control include a speed increase for one or more of the silver halide emulsions in a multicolour diffusion transfer photographic system and or an increase in the DmaX of one or more of the individual colours due to control of fog development, as will be illustrated in detail below herein. The advantageous resluts obtained through the use of the mercaptoazole compounds according to the invention are not completely understood.However, to further aid those skilled in the art to understand and practice the invention, the proposed theoretical mechanism by which the advantageous results are thought to be effected will be discussed here. It should be understood, however, that the diffusion transfer photographic system has been proved to be operative and highly effective through extensive experimentation and the proposed theoretical mechanism is not to be construed as being limiting of the invention.It is theorized that the results obtained according to the invention are due to the compounds performing different functions at different stages of the development process, that is, as weak silver solvents and promoters of development at one stage of the development process and as development inhibitors, or restrainers, at another stage of the development process, and that the dual functions of these compounds within the diffusion transfer photographic system are pH dependent.It is well known that in the diffusion transfer photographic development process the pH of any particular location within the film unit varies with time. Typically, the processing composition employed in the process has a very high pH, e.g., from about 13 14, and during the development process each layer of the multilayer film unit goes through a broad pH range which includes very high pE levels and relatively low pH levels. When the pH is substantially equal to or above the pXa of the substituent R1 on the phenyl ring, the dianion is formed, for example,EMI10.1 and acts as a weak silver solvent to form relatively soluble silver salts, thus promoting development.When the pH falls below the p a of the substituent R1, the monoanion is formed, for example,EMI10.2 and the silver salt of the monoanion of the compound is very low in solubility resulting in a development restrainer action.In the instances where certain substituted phenylmercaptotetrazole compounds were taught for use in specified photographic applications, i.e., the Research Disclosure article and U.S. Patent 3,295,976, previously cited, the processes do not involve different pH at different stages of the development process. Thus, the pH dependent dual functions of these compounds were not known or utilized in the processes disclosed in these references.The compounds used according to the invention may be incorporated in various locations within the diffusion transfer film unit such as, for example, in the processing composition, in one or more layers within the ph tosensit ive element or in one or more layers in the image receiving element such as the image receiving layer. In view of the foregoing discussion, it will be understood that, according to the invention, development of the exposed photosensitive element is carried out with a processing composition having an initial pH substantially equal to or above the pKa ofR1, at least for some period of time after the processing composition comes into contact with the mercaptoazole compound so as to enable the substituent to ionize to form the dianion. In addition, at some point during the development process the pH of the environment where the compound is located is reduced below the p a of R1 so as to form the monoanion. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSFor a better understanding of the invention as well as other objects and further features thereof, reference is made to the following detailed description of various pre ferred embodiments thereof taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein Fig. 1 is a graphical illustration of the relative amount of silver developed with respect to time in exposed and unexposed areas for a control film unit and a film unit according to the invention, both processed at room temperature and Fig. 2 is a similar graphical illustration for the same fllm units processed at 3500. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTSThe preferred compounds which are employed in accordance with the invention are represented by the formulasEMI12.1 EMI13.1 EMI14.1 The mercaptoazole compounds which are useful according to the invention may be prepared by reactions which are well known in the art.For example, 2 mercaptoimidazoles can be prepared by the reactions disclosed in The Chemistry ofHeterocyclic Compounds Vol. 6 Imidazole and Its Derivatives, Part I, Hofmann, Interscience Publishers, Inc., NewYork, 1953, pages 77 85 mercaptothiazoles and mercaptobenzothiazoles can be prepared according to the methods disclosed in The Chemistry of Heterocyclic CompoundsVol. 34 Thiazole and Its Derivatives, Part I, Metzger,John Wiley and Sons, 1979, pages 260 269 Part 2, pages 370 377 benzoxazolethiones can be prepared according to the methods disclosed in Heterocyclic Compounds, Vol. 5,Elderfield, John Wiley and Sons, 1957, pages 439 444 5 mercapto 1,3,4 oxadiazoles can be prepared according to the methods disclosed in Heterocyclic Compounds, Vol. 7,Elderfield, John Wiley and Sons, 1961, page 352 mercapto 1,3,4 thiadiazoles, ibid, pages 587 612 and tetrazoles by the techniques disclosed in Heterocyclic Compounds, Vol. 8,Elderfield, John Wiley and Sons, 1967, pages 1 107. Mercapto 1,2,4 triazoles can be prepared by known literature techniques as described, for example, in Jour. Chem. Soc.E. Haggarth 1163 1949 . The compounds within Formulas A,B and C where R is a blocking group can be prepared also by known reactions such as by preforming the monosodium salt of the appropriate mercaptoazole derivative and carrying out a condensation reaction with the appropriate blocking group in a solvent such as acetone, ethanol, acetonitrile, etc., or by reacting the mercaptoazole derivative with the appropriate blocking group in a suitable solvent in the presence of one equivalent of sodium bicarbonate. Alternatively, the appropriate mercaptoazole derivative can be. formed and the blocking group attached by means of a Michael addition with an appropriate olefin such as CH2 CH Y where Y is an electron withdrawing group such as cyano, etc., according to known teachings in the art. The preparation of compound I is described in Pharmazie, 29 2 , 1974 , pp 95 99. The preparation of compound IV is described in Khim. Geterotsikl. Soedin., Sb.1 Azotsoderzhashchie Geterotsikl, 1967, pp 199 201. CompoundsVI and VII can be prepared in accordance with the disclosure of U.S. Patent 3,295,976.Compound II and Compounds XII XIX are per se novel compounds.As stated previously, R1 may also be a precursor of a substituent which has the requisite properties and the desired substituent may be formed in sit . For example, where it is desired to develop the exposed photosensitive element in the presence of a compound within Formula A which has a hydroxy group on the phenyl ring, it is possible to incorporate in the film unit as a precursor a compound withinFormula A which has a hydrolyzable ester group on the phenyl ring and generate the desired hydroxy group in situ during photographic processing.It should be noted here that the acetyl group which is substituted on the phenyl ring in compound XI does not ionize to any appreciable extent to form an anion in an aqueous alkaline photographic processing composition. However, it has been shown by experimentation that incorporating compound XI in a film unit according to the invention will provide advantageous results. Thus, it would appear that compound XI undergoes a change in aqueous alkaline processing composition and that the acetyl substituent is a precursor of a group which has the requisite properties described above which provide the desired results.It has also been found that when incorporated in the processing composition for a period of time, for example, about a week or more, prior to processing of the exposed photosensitive element, the compound does not provide the the desired results, thus indicating that it has long term instability characteristics in the aqueous alkaline processing composition. It is therefore preferred to incorporate the compound elsewhere in the film unit, for example, in the photosensitive element.Table I lists the pKa of various substituents in certain of the compounds illustrated above. TABLE I COMPOUND pKa I 10.10 0.1, II 11.4 III 9.50 0.1 IV 9.95 0.1 V 11.55 0.1 VI 9.55 0.1 VII 8.65 0.1 IX 8.80 0.1Solubility product measurements were made for the silver salt of phenylmercaptotetrazole PMT at pH 13.5 and for the silver salt of compound II at pH 7 and pH 13.5 above and below the pKa of the oxime substituent . The results are listed in Table II. TABLE II COMPOUND pH KSp 7 3x10 16 PMT 13.5 4 x 10 16 7 1 x 10 16 II 13.5 2 x 10 15 Z.C.H. Tan, Photogr.Sci.ng. 19, 17 1975 It is seen that while phenylmercaptotetrazole was relatively unaffected by pH the ionization of the oxime substituent increased the solubility of the silver salt of compound II by an order of magnitude.The solubilities of the silver salts of PMT and compound II in the presence of excess amounts of their anions were measured at pH 7.0 and 13.5. Each solution was 4 x molar in silver. The results are shown in Table III wherein the solubility data is expressed in moles liter of total silver. TABt III COMPOUND MT PMT Molar Ratio pH pHCompound Ag 7.0 13.5 7.0 13.5 1.25 1 1 19 1 1 1.75 1 1 44 1 2 2.13 1 1 93 1 4 2.5 1 2 140 3 8 4.5 1 2 320 15 18 7.5 1 5 1400 58 63 It can be seen that compound II is a weak to moderate silver solvent at high pH while PMT is not. Further, it is evident that when the oxime substituent is protonated it reverts to behaviour which is similar to that of PMT. In fact, compound II forms an even less soluble salt in neutral solution than does PMT, thus giving it greater differentiation on the availability of silver in soluble form as the pH drops in the diffusion transfer development process. As stated previously, the compounds which employed according to the invention may be incorporated in any location in the film unit with the preferred location in any particular instance being dependent upon various factors such as the compound itself, the type of film unit and the results desired. The compounds generally may be incorporated in the film unit in any useful amount. Routine scoping tests may be used to ascertain the concentration appropriate for any given film unit and location. When the compounds are incorporated in the processing composition they are present preferably in an amount of from about 0.02 to about 0.07 by weight. When incorporated in a layer in the photosensitive element the compounds are typically present in a ratio of from about 1 mg m2 to about 3 mg m2 to about 3800 mg m of silver.It has been observed that, typically, where the compounds are incorporated in the photosensitive element, the total amount required per film unit to give a desired result is less than that required when the compound is incorporated in the processing composition. It has also been observed that too great an amount of the compounds can lead to reduced control of one ore more of the image dye providing materials which results in highDmin values in the photographic reproduction or can lead to a loss in Dmax for one or more colours as will be apparent from the Examples.In a preferred embodiment of the invention compounds according to the invention can be incorporated in more than one location in the diffusion transfer film unit. For example, part of the total quantity of the substituted phenylmrcaptoazole compound can be incorporated in the processing composition and the remainder in the photo sensitive element. Thus, during the initial stages of development, the quantity available can be appropriate to provide a speed increase for on or more silver halide emulsions silver solvent effect without providing any undesired premature development restraint and the additional quantity dissolved during processing could give a total concentration desired to prevent further development.This embodiment is particularly useful where R is H or an alkali metal for the compound incorporated in the processing composition and R is a cleavable group for the compound incorporated in the photosensitive element.The compounds used in accordance with the invention may be used generally in association with any silver halide emulsion. It is preferred to use the compounds in a diffusion transfer photographic system which includes a negative silver halide emulsion, i.e., one which develops in the areas of exposure. The diffusion transfer photographic system of the invention may include any image dye providing material in association with the silver halide emulsion s .The image dye providing materials which can be utilized generally may be characterized as either 1 initially soluble or diffusible in the processing composition but which are selectively rendered nondiffusible imagewise as a function of development or 2 initially insoluble or nondiffusible in the processing composition but which selectively provide a diffusible product imagewise as a function of development. The image dye providing materials may be complete dyes or dye intermediates, e.g., colour couplers. The requisite differential in mobility or solubility may be obtained, for example, by a chemical reaction such as a redox reaction, a coupling reaction or a cleavage reaction. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention the image dye providing materials are dye developers which are initially diffusible materials.The dye developers contain, in the same molecule, both the chromophoric system of a dye and a silver halide developing function as is described in U.S. Patent 2,983,606. Other image dye providing materials which may be used include, for example, initiallv diffusible coupling dves such as are useful in the diffusion transfer process described inU.S. Patent 3,087,817 and which are rendered nondiffusible by coupling with the oxidation product of a colour developer initially nondiffusible dyes which release a diffusible dye following oxidation, sometimes referred to as redox dye releaser dyes, such as described in U.S.Patents 3,725,062 and 4,076,529 initially nondiffusible image dye providing materials which release a diffusible dye following oxidation and intramolecular ring closure as are described in U.S. Patent 3,433,939 or undergo silver assisted cleavage to release a diffusible dye in accordance with the disclousre of U.S. Patent 3,719,489 and initially nondiffusible image dye providing materials which release a diffusible dye following coupling with an oxidized colour developer as described in U.S. Patent 3,227,550.The compounds may be incorporated into the photographic elements by any suitable technique. In embodiments where the compounds are incorporated in a separate discrete layer or in a silver halide emulsion layer they are typically coated from a water dispersion and the layer includes a binder material such as gelatin or the like.The diffusion transfer film units of the invention include those wherein the image receiving element is designed to be separated from the photosensitive element after processing and integral positive negative diffusion transfer film units which are retained intact after processing. In a preferred embodiment the diffusion transfer film units of the invention utilize initially diffusible dye developers as the image dye providing materials. As described in U.S.Patent 2,983,606, a photosensitive element containing a dye developer and a silver halide emulsion is photoexposed and a processing composition applied thereto, for example, by immersion, coating, spraying, flowing, etc., in the dark. The exposed photosensitive element is superposed prior to, during, or after the processing composition is applied, on a sheet like support element which may be utilized as an image receiving element. In a preferred embodiment, the processing composition is applied to the exposed photosensitive element in a substantially uniform layer as the photosensitive element is brought into superposed relationship with the image receiving layer. The processing composition, positioned intermediate the photosensitive element and the image receiving layer, permeates the emulsion to initiate development of the latent image contained therein.The dye developer is immobilized or precipitated in exposed areas as a consequence of the development of the latent image. This immobilization is apparently, at least in part, due to a change in the solubility characteristics of the dye developer upon oxidation and especially as regards its solubility in alkaline solutions. It may also be due in part to a tanning effect on the emulsion by oxidized developing agent, and in part to a localized exhaustion of alkali as a result of development. In unexposed and partially exposed areas of the emulsion, the dye developer is unreacted and diffusible and thus provides an imagewise distribution of unoxidized dye developer, diffusible in the processing composition, as a function of the point to point degree of exposure of the silver halide emulsion. At least part of this imagewise distribution of unoxidized dye developer is transferred, by imbibition, to a superposed image receiving layer or element, said transfer substantially excluding oxidized dye developer. The image receiving layer receives a depthwise diffusion, from the developed emulsion, of unoxididized dye developer without appreciably disturbing the imagewise distribution thereof to provide a reversed or positive colour image of the developed image. The image receiving element may contain agents adapted to mordant or otherwise fix the diffused, unoxidized dye developer. In a preferred In a preferred embodiment of said U.S. Patent No.2,983,606 and in certain commercial applications thereof, the desired positive image is revealed by separating the image receiving layer from the photosensitive element at the end of a suitable imbibition period. Alternatively, as also disclosed in said U.S. Patent No. 2,983,606, the image receiving layer need not be separated from its superposed contact with the photosensitive element, subsequent to transfer image formation, if the support for the imagereceiving layer, as well as any other layers intermediate said support and image receiving layer, is transparent and a processing composition containing a substance, e.g., a white pigment, effective to mask the developed silver halide emulsion or emulsions is applied between the image receiving layer and said silver halide emulsion or emulsions.Dye developers, as noted in said U.S. Patent No. 2,983,606, are compounds which contain, in the same molecule, both the chromophoric system of a dye and also a silver halide developing function. By a silver halide developing function1, is meant a grouping adapted to develop exposed silver halide. A preferred silver halide development function is a hydroquinonyl group. In general, the development function includes a benzonoid developing function, that is, an aromatic developing group which forms quinonoid or quinone substances when oxidized.Multicolour images may be obtained using dye developers in diffusion transfer processes by several techniques. One such technique contemplates obtaining multicolour transfer images utilizing dye developers by employment of an integral multilayer photosensitive element, such as is disclosed in the aforementioned U.S. Patent No. 2,983,606 and in U.S. Patent No. 3,345,163, wherein at least two selectively sensitized photosensitive strata, superposed on a single support, are processed, simultaneously and without separation, with a single common image receiving layer.A suitable arrangement of this type comprises a support carrying a red sensitive silver halide emulsion stratum, a green sensitive silver halide emulsion stratum and a bluesensitive silver halide emulsion stratum, said emulsions having associated therewith, respectively, for example, a cyan dye developer, a magenta dye developer and a yellow dye developer. The dye developer may be utilized in the silver halide emulsion stratum, for example in the form of particles, or it may be disposed in a stratum behind the appropriate silver halide emulsion strata. Each set of silver halide emulsion and associated dye developer strata may be separated from other sets by suitable interlayers, for example, by a layer or stratum of gelatin or polyvinyl alcohol.In certain instances, it may be desirable to incorporate a yellow filter in front of the green sensitive emulsion and such yellow filter may be incorporated in an interlayer. However, where desirable, a yellow dye developer of the appropriate spectral characteristics and present in a state capable of functioning as a yellow filter may be so employed and a separate yellow filter omitted.Particularly useful products for obtaining multicolour dye developer images are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,415,644.This patent discloses photographic products wherein a photosensitive element and an image receiving element are maintained in fixed relationship prior to exposure, andthis relationship is maintained as a laminate after processing and image formation. In these products, the final image is viewed through a transparent support element against a light reflecting, i.e., white background. Photoexposure is made through said transparent element and application of the processing composition provides a layer of light reflecting material to provide a white background.The light reflecting material referred to in said patent as an opacifying agent is preferably titanium dioxide, and it also performs an opacifying function, i.e. it is effective to mask the developed silver halide emulsions so that the transfer image may be viewed without interference therefrom, and it also acts to protect the photoexposed silver halide emulsions from postexposure fogging by light passing through said transparent layer if the photoexposed film unit is removed from the camera before image formation is completed.U.S. Patent No. 3,647,437 is concerned with improvements in products and processes disclosed in said U.S. PatentNo. 3,415,644, and discloses the provision of light absorbing materials to permit such processes to be performed, outside of the camera in which photoexposure is effected, under much more intense ambient light conditions. A lightabsorbing material or reagent, preferably a pH sensitive phthalein dye, is provided so positioned and or constituted as not to interfere with photoexposure but so positioned between the photoexposed silver halide emulsions and the transparent support during processing after photoexposure as to absorb light which otherwise might fog the photoexposed emulsions. Furthermore, the light absorbing material is so positioned and or constituted after processing as not to interfere with viewing the desired image shortly after said image has been formed.In the preferred embodiments, the light absorbing material, also sometimes referred to as an optical filter agent, is initially contained in the processing composition together with a light reflecting material, e.g., titanium dioxide. The concentration of the light absorbing dye is selected to provide the light transmission opacity required to perfor the particular process under the selected light conditions.In a particularly useful embodiment, the light absorbing dye is highly coloured at the pH of the processing composition, e.g., 13 14, but is substantially non absorbing of visible light at a lower pH, e.g., less than 10 12.This pH reduction may be effected by an acid reacting reagent appropriately positioned in the film unit, e.g.., in a layer between the transparent support and the imagereceiving layer.The dye developers are preferably selected for their ability to provide colors that are useful in carrying out substractive colour photography, that is, the previously mentioned cyan, magenta and yellow. The dye developers employed may be incorporated in the respective silver halide emulsion or, in the preferred embodiment, in a separate layer behind the respective silver halide emulsion, and such a layer of dye developer may be applied by use of a coating solution containing the respective dye developer distributed, in a concentration calculated to give the desired coverage of dye developer per unit area, in a film forming natural, or synthetic, polymer, for example, gelatin, polyvinyl alcohol, and the like, adapted to be permeated by the processing composition. Other diffusion transfer products and processes according to the invention are the types described in U.S. Patents 3,573,043 and 3,594,165. For convenience, the entire disclosure of each of the six patents referred to immediately above is hereby incorporated by reference herein.A particularly useful film unit according to the invention is one wherein the photosensitive element includes a light reflecting layer between the silver halide layer and the image dye providing layer as described in CanadianPatent 668,952 , the substrate of the photosensitive element carries the polymeric acid neutralizing layer which in turn carries the timing layer as described inU.S. Patent 3,573,043 and the processing composition includes an oximated polydiacetone acrylamide thickening agent as described in U.S. Patent 4,202,694 .The invention will now be described further in detail with respect to specific preferred embodiments by way of examples, it being understood that these are illustrative only and the invention is not intended to be limited to the materials, conditions, process parameters, etc. which are recited therein. All parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated. EXAMPLE IAs a control a film unit was prepared as follows The photosensitive element comprised a subcoated transparent polyethylene terephthalate photographic film base having coated thereon the following layers in succession 1. a layer of sodium cellulose sulfate coated at a coverage of about 27.6 mg m2 2. a layer of a cyan dye developer represented by the formulaEMI27.1 dispersed in gelatin and coated at a coverage of about 747 mg m2 of the dye developer and about 1554 mglml of gelatin and including about 68 mg m2 of 4 methylphenylhydroquinone and about 270 mg m7 of 2 phenylbenzimidazole 3. a red sensitive silver iodobromide emulsion layer coated at a coverage of about 1280 mg m2 of silver and about 768 mg m2 of gelatin 4. an interlayer comprising about 2505 mg m2 of a 60 29 6 4 0.4 pentapolymer of butylacrylate, diacetone acrylamide, methacrylic acid, styrene and acrylic acid and about 78 mug 2 of polyacrylamide 5. a layer of a magenta dye developer represented by the formulaEMI28.1 dispersed in gelatin and coated at a coverage of about 646 mg m2 of the dye developer, about 448 mg m2 of gelatin and including about 229 mg m2 of 2 phenylbenzimidazole 6. a green sensitive silver iodobromide layer coated at a coverage of about 1050 mg m2 of silver and about 504 mg m2 of gelatin 7. a layer comprising about 215 mg m2 of dodecyl aminoreductone and about 215 mg m2 of gelatin 8. an interlayer comprising about 1366 mg m2 of the pentapolymer described in layer 4, about 87 rng m2, about 78 mg m2 of polyacrylamide and about 71 mgiml of succindialdehyde 9. a layer of a yellow dye developer re presented by the formulaEMI29.1 dispersed in gelatin and coated at a coverage of about 968 mg m2 of dye developer and about 451 mg m2 of gelatin and including about 208 mg ml of phenylbenzimidazole 10. a blue sensitive silver iodobromide emulsion layer coated at a coverage of about 1280 mg m of silver, about 775 mg m2 of gelatin and about 306 mg m of 4 methyl phenyl hydroquinone 11. an overcoat layer coated at a coverage of about 461 mg m7 of gelatin and about 21 mg m2 of carbon black.The image receiving element comprised a transparent polyethylene terephthalate film base coated with the following layers in succession 1. as a polymeric acid layer approximately 9 parts of a 1 2 butyl ester of polyethylene maleic anhydride copolymer and 1 part of polyvinyl butyral coated at a coverage of about 26,372 mg m2 2. a timing layer containing about 4575 mg m2 of a 60 304 6 tetrapolymer of butylacrylate, diacetone acrylamide, styrene and methacrylic acid and including 9 polyvinyl alcohol and 3. a polymeric image receiving layer of a 3 parts of a mixture of 2 parts polyvinyl alcohol and 1 part poly 4vinyl pyridine and b 1 part of a graft copolymer comprised of 4 vinylpyridine 4VP and vinylbenzyl trimethyl ammonium chloride TMQ grafted onto hydroxyethyl cellulose HEC at a ratio of HEC 4VP TMO of 2.2 2.2 1 coated at a coverage of about 3229 mg m2. The film unit was processed with an aqueous alkaline processing composition as follows Titanium dioxide 38.05 g.Carboxymethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose 2.00 g.Potassium hydroxide 45 aqueous solution 11.11 g. ncnzotriazolc 0.28 g.6 methyl uracil 0.30 g N hydroxyethyl N,N ,N tris carboxymethyl ethylene diamine 0.75 g. Polyethylene glycol MW 4000 0.45 g. Bis 2 aminoeehyl sulfide 0.02 g.Colloidal silica 308 aqueous dispersion 1.85 g. N phon thyl a picolinium bromide 50 aqueous solution 2.55 g. 4 aminopyrazolo 3,4 d pyrimidine 0.25 EMI31.1 EMI32.1 Water to make a total of 100. gA film unit according to the invention was prepared identical to the control with the exception that the processing composition further included 0.05 of compound II.The film units were processed at room temperature as follows one half of each film unit was exposed through the transparent base of the image receiving element to light from a Xenon source 100 meter candle seconds which was passed in turn through an ultraviolet filter, neutral density filters to reduce the film plane light flux to 0.5 m c s, and a Wratten 47B blue filter the other half of each film unit was not exposed. The film units were then processed by passing them through a pair of rollers at a gap spacing of about 0.08 mm and the relative amount of silver developed a function of the infra red light absorbed was measured as a function of time for both the exposed and unexposed areas. The relative amount of developed silver vs time curves are shown in Fig. 1.It is seen that the presence of compound II reduced fog development relative amount of developed silver in unexposed areas in comparison to the control. It is also apparent that the difference between the relative amount of silver developed in exposed and unexposed regions in the presence of compound II is significantly greater than the corresponding difference for the control.The experiment was repeated with processing being carried out at 350C. The relative amounts of developed silver vs time curves are shown in Fig. 2. It is seen that fog development in the control increased significantly at the higher processing temperature, whereas the increase was only slight with compound II present. Further, at the higher processing temperature the presence of compound II greatly reduced fog development in comparison to the control without any appreciable change in the rate at which exposed silver halide was developed. EXAMPLE IIAs a control a film unit was prepared as follows The photosensitive element comprised a subcoated opaque polyethylene terephthalate photographic film base having coated thereon the following layers in succession 1. a cyan dye developer layer coated at a coverage of about 742 mg m2 of the cyan dye developer described inExample I, about 1485 mg m2 of gelatin, about 68 mg m2 of 4 methylphenylhydroquinone and about 270 mg m2 of 2 phenylbenzimidazole 2. a red sensitive silver iodobromide emulsion layer coated at a coverage of about 1290 mg m of silver and about 775 mg m of gelatin 3. an interlayer of a 60 30 4 6 tetrapolymer of butyl acrylate, diacetone acrylamide, styrene and methacrylic acid coated at a coverage of about 2582 mg m2 of the tetrapolymer and about 68 mg m of polyacrylamide 4. a magenta dye developer layer coated at a coverage of about 646 mg m2 of the magenta dye developer described inExample I, about 452 mg m2 of gelatin, about 11 mglml of carbon black and about 226 mg m2 of 2 phenylbenzimidazole 5. a green sensitive silver iodobromide layer coated at a coverage of about 795 mg ml of silver. and about 525 mg m2 of gelatin 6. an interlayer including about 1452 mg m2 of the tetrapolymer described in layer 3, about 75 mg m2 of polyacrylamide and about 71 mg m2 of succindialdehyde 7. a yellow dye developer layer coated at a coverage of about 968 mg m2 of the yellow dye developer described inExample I, about 452 mg m2 of gelatin, about 27 mg m2 of carbon black and about 204 mg m2 of 2 phenylbenzimidazole 8. a blue sensitive silver iodobromide emulsion layer coated at a coverage of about 1280 mg m2 of silver, about 563 mg m2 of gelatin and about 204 mg m .of 4 methyl phenyl hydroquinone 9. an overcoat layer coated at a coverage of about 484 ms m2 of gelatin and about 43 mg m2 of carbon black.The image receiving element was identical to that described in Example I.The film unit was processed with a control aqueous alkaline processing composition which was the same as the control described in Example I with the exception that it included 0.55 g of benzotriazole and did not include any 4 aminopyrazolo 3,4 d pyrimidine.The film unit was exposed 0.5 meter candle seconds on a sensitometer to a photographic test exposure scale, or step wedge, through the transparent support of the imagereceiving element and processedsat 240C with the processing composition by passing the film unit through a pair of pressure rollers set at a gap spacing of about 0.08 mm.The film unit was retained intact and viewed through the transparent base. There was obtained a well developed imageThe neutral density column of the image was read on the densitometer to obtain the Dmax values for red, green and blue curves, respectively. In addition, the speed of the red, green and blue curves, respectively defined as the negative log of the relative exposure required to give red, green and blue absorption in the neutral column a reflection density of 0.75 was measured. The values obtained are shown in Table IV.The experiment was repeated with five additional film units IIA IIE with the exception that the processing composition further included compound XI in the amounts shown inTable IV.

Thus it is apparent that in this case about 0.025 of compound XI gave the optimum combination of speed increase and Dmax increase.The data also show that in a given film unit excessive concentrations of the compound for that film unit can lead to undesirable results thus in FilmUnit lIE the blue speed dropped considerably indicating premature inhibition of development of the blue sensitive silver halide layer. EXAMPLE IIIThe experiment described in Example II was repeated with six film units IIIA IIIF which included compound II in the amounts shown in Table V. In addition, certain of the film units were also processed at 350C. The room temperature data for the control film unit of Example II were used for comparison. In addition, a control film unit was processed at 350C. TALL V 24 CFilm Comp d Dmax rel.

EXAMPLE IVTwo sets of film units, identical to those described inExample II except that the processing composition of one IVA contained 0.025 of compound XI and that of the other, IVB contained 0.05 of compound II were processed at 240C and 350C.
