# Process for improving films of poly p methylstyrene and copolymers.

## Abstract
A method for improving properties of thermoplastic films by irradiating films of poly p methylstyrene of p methylstyrene copolymers with acrylonitrile, or of high impact poly p methylstyrene with ionizing radiation at a dosage from 30 to 70 megarads preferably from 40 to 60 megarads . The irradiated films are heat resistant and have increased tensile properties at elevated temperatures.
