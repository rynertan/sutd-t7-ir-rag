# Production of titanium metal sponge and apparatus therefor.

## Abstract
Titanium metal sponge is produced in a closed cell sys tem by a electrolytically decomposing molten magnesium chloride into magnesium metal and chlorine gas within a closed cell, the magnesium metal forming as a molten layer upon the magnesium chloride b terminating the electrolytic decomposition, and then c directly contacting titanium tetrachloride with the layer of magnesium metal to effect a reduction reaction ther ebetween within the same closed cell to form titanium metal sponge and magnesium chloride and d removing the titanium metal sponge from the closed cell. Apparatus for carrying out the process is also described.
