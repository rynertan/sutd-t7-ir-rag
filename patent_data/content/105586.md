# Apparatus for making frozen food products.

## Abstract
An apparatus 17 for making frozen food products, particularly ice cream or the like, in which the apparatus 17 can be interchangeable with the existing ice dispenser unit 5 in the freezer compartment 3 of a domestic refrigerator 1 provided with an automatic ice maker unit 5 . The apparatus 17 includes a housing 21 for containing the frozen food product mix stirring means 33 disposed within the housing 21 for stirring the mix during convection heat exchange between the mix and the interior of the freezer compartment 3 a drive assembly 29 for detachably connecting the stirring means 33 to a drive motor 9 , and a user operated timer assembly 31 for actuating the drive motor 9 to operate for a predetermined period of time in accordance with the desired consistency of the final product. A switch assembly 51 is preferably incorporated in the circuitry of the refrigerator 1 for direct activation by the time assembly 31 for the dual purpose of operating the drive motor 9 and placing the refrigerator compressor in con tinuous operation. An integral timber 117 is preferably disposed in the switch assembly circuit for causing cyclical operation of the drive motor 9 to prevent failure of that motor 9 which might otherwise occur during its continuous operation.
