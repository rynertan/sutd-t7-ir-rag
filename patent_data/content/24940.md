# Method and apparatus for transmission of serial data.

## Abstract
N bit serial data is sent from a data sender MAS to a data receiver SLV through data transmission lines. There are pro vided a first data transmission line SL and a second transmis sion line RL. Circuits GS1, GS2 in the data receiver SLV send back to the data sender MAS, through the second data trans mission line RL, the bit content of received N bit data each time one bit of the N bit data is received at data receiver SLV through the first data transmission line SL. A comparator COIM in the data sender compares the transmitted bit content and the bit content sent back on the second data transmission line RL. A detection circuit DTCS is provided in the data receiver SLV. The data sender MAS transmits a start bit of a prescribed logical value before the N bit serial data is sent, and after the N bit serial data has been sent, transmits the result of comparison in comparator COIM as an alarm bit. The detection circuit DTCS detects whether the logical values of the start bit and the alarm bit are prescribed logical values, whereby a transmission error or a break in a transmission line can be detected.
