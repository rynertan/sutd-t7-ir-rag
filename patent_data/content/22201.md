# Cathode assembly.

## Abstract
A cathode assembly for cathode ray tube which comprises a cathode sleeve 22 with a blackened surface, a first cylindrical reflective member 25 fixedly put on the top of the sleeve 22 with a fixing point 26 therebetween and having one end portion with a metal substrate 21 , and a second cylindrical reflective member 24 attached to the sleeve 22 by means of support members 23 so as to be on the same axis with the sleeve 22 and having a diameter greater than that of the sleeve 22 , both members 25, 24 being provided for reflecting radiant heat from the sleeve 22 , and the length of the first member 25 being set so that an angle formed between the longitudinal direction of the sleeve 22 and a straight line connecting a radiation peak point 29 on the outer surface of the sleeve 22 and the inner edge of a top of the second member 24 , on a plane passing through the same axis, may be 30 or less.
