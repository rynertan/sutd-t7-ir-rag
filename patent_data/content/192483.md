## Description
The present invention relates to a closure arrangement and in particular to a closure arrangement for use with gates, doors and the like. In particular gates, doors and the like used on farms, orchards and the like. Up until this time closure arrangements or members of a generally hook type formation have been known. The closure arrangements used up until this time have been used in association with a staple or substantially U shaped connector, to allow for releaseable engagement therebetween, such as to permit the releaseable closing of doors, gates and the like. In arrangements used up until this time, such as for example on farms, orchards and the like, a staple or substantially U shaped connector is hammered or inserted into a gate post or upright. A known closure arrangement is then attached to a door or gate, such as by an elongate length of strip, wire or chain. The closure member is then able to be engaged over and with the connector, to close the gate, and to be disengaged therefrom to open the gate. The closure arrangements used up until this time have essentially been of a substantially hook type formation being integrally formed with at least first and second arm portions. The arm portions are spaced apart so as to define a closure space therebetween. At least one of the arm portions has a locking clip pivotally attached thereto. The locking clip is preferably substantially semi circular or U shaped in formation and free ends thereof are pivotally connected to substantially opposing and aligned sides of at least one arm portion of the hook. This then allows the locking clip to pivot freely relative to the arm portion and to freely move into a position in which it is in abutment with an inner surface of an adjacent and spaced apart second arm portion. In use, the hook is placed over a connector, so that the connector moves into the closure space between the arm portions. In being so located, the locking clip is pivoted out of its position in which it abuts against an adjacent surface of the second arm portion, so as to allow entry of the connector into the closure space. Following such entry, the locking clip is released and pivoted back into a position in which it abuts against said spaced apart inner surface of the second arm portion, in which position it locates and serves to hold the closure arrangement in position, relative to the connector. The connector and closure arrangement are then engaged one with the other in a releaseable locking engagement. This arrangement has however run across problems, in that only a slight movement of the closure arrangement relative to the connector is necessary to loosen and move the locking clip out of its abutment with the second arm portion, to thus open the closure space and allow for disengagement of the closure arrangement from the connector. In farms and orchards, some animals such as for example cattle, become relatively educated as to farm hardware and the like. Thus, in such situations, animals such as cattle can utilise their heads and noses to push or move the hook portion of closure members upwardly, knowing that the upward movement will in turn move the freely pivoted locking clip out of position and allow for disengagement of the closure arrangement from the connector. The problems associated with such closure arrangements used up until this time, also mean that such closure arrangements can be opened relatively easily by children, and this is of course a problem when such a closure arrangement is used for closing and securing doors or gates such as around prohibited areas, swimming pools, lakes, dangerous goods and the like. Essentially, it is a problem with the closure arrangements used up until this time, that such arrangements have been capable of being disengaged too easily, by both animals and people. It is an object of this invention to go some way towards overcoming or at least minimising the problems associated with closure arrangements used up until this time. It is a further object of this invention to provide a closure arrangement which is straight forward and efficient in use. According to one aspect of this invention there is provided a closure arrangement including at least two integrally formed and spaced apart arm portions defining a closure space therebetween a locking member being pivotally connected to at least a first arm portion, and extending into, so as to be capable of substantially closing, said closure space said locking member being so formed and mounted to said first arm portion, as to be resiliently biased into releasable abutment with an adjacent surface of a second arm portion. According to a further aspect of this invention, there is provided a closure arrangement including at least two integrally formed and spaced apart arm portions, defining a closure space therebetween a locking member being pivotally connected to at least a first arm portion, by ends of said locking member being pivotally connected to said at least first arm portion, and being off set relative to each other so as to resiliently bias said locking member into releaseable abutment with an adjacent and spaced apart surface of second arm portion. A preferred embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein The closure arrangement of the present invention is preferably formed of an appropriate steel material, although this is by way of example only. If desired, the closure arrangement can be formed of any other appropriate material, such as for example plastics and the like. Referring to Figure 1 of the accompanying drawing, it will be seen that the closure arrangement is of an essentially hook shaped formation, including at least two spaced apart arm portions, being a first arm portion 2 and a second arm portion 3. The first arm portion 2 is essentially elongate in formation and is curved at its upper end and leads into a second, curved elongate arm portion 3. The arm portions 2 and 3 are preferably integrally formed one with the other, and in the preferred form of the invention, the arm portion 3 is longer than the arm portion 2, and curves inwardly towards and under a lower end of the arm portion 2. The arm portions 2 and 3 define between them, a closure space 4. As shown in Figure 1 of the drawings, the first arm portion 2 is connected to a chain 2a, which in turn can be attached to a gate or door, or the like. In order to secure such a gate to a gate post or upright, a connector 1, such as a staple or substantially U shaped connector, is hammered or placed into, or engaged with, a gate post or upright not shown . Thus, in order to secure a gate to a gate post or upright, such as in a closed position, the elongate arm 3 is slipped over the connector 1, so that the connector 1 is passed up into and housed within the closure space 4. This then serves to secure the gate in a closed position. In order to open the gate, an upward movement is applied to the arm 3, which will disengage the connector member 1 from within the closure space 4, and disengage the closure arrangement from the connector member 1. This will then allow the gate or door to open. While this embodiment is described with reference to the closure arrangement being attached to a gate or door, and the connector to a post or upright, it should be appreciated that this is by way of example only. If desired, the closure arrangement can be mounted to a post or upright, and the connector to a gate or door. It will be appreciated that the prior arrangements referred to hereinbefore, which have brought about certain problems, have had a locking clip pivotally connected to a first arm portion 2 in a free pivoting manner. This then means that such locking clips have up until this time, been able to pivot and move freely relative to first arm portions 2. Thus in the engagement referred to hereinbefore, and on a connector being located within the closure space 4, a locking clip has been freely pivoted out of the way to allow for location, whereafter it will freely move back into substantial abutment with an inner adjacent surface of a second arm portion, to close off the closure space and allow for some form of locking. To remove the connector 1 from within the closure space, the locking clip is freely pivoted out of position to allow for removal. As indicated hereinbefore, numerous problems have been associated with such arrangements. The arrangement of the preferred embodiment of the present invention allows for a locking member in the form of a clip or ring, shown as 5 in the accompanying drawings. The locking member 5 is preferably of a substantially U formation, and is pivotally attached at its free ends, within locating holes 7 provided adjacent a bottom end of the first arm portion 2. The free ends 5a of the locking member 5 are preferably bent or turned inwardly, so as to allow for pivotal engagement with such holes 7, the holes 7 being preferably off set relative to each other, both longitudinally relative to the longitudinal axis of the first arm portion 2 and laterally relative to each other. While it is preferred that the free ends 5a be pivotally engaged with the first arm portion 2, so as to be both longitudinally and laterally off set, this is by way of example only. If desired, the ends 5a of the locking member 5 and the holes or bores 7 can be longitudinally off set relative to each other, and or laterally or horizontally off set relative to each other. In the preferred form of the invention, the locking member 5 is formed of a sprung or biased material, such as for example a sprung metal material. This is however by way of example only. The location of the locking member 5, relative to the first arm portion 2, is shown with reference to Figures 1 and 2 of the accompanying drawings. The pivotal location of the locking member 5 relative to the first arm portion 2, such as in the manner referred to hereinbefore, resiliently biases the locking member 5 into a downward position in which it is resiliently biased against an inner and adjacent surface 3a of the second arm portion 3. The locking member 5 is therefore resiliently held in this position, and a a positive upward movement against the spring bias, such as in the direction of arrow B in Figure 1 of the drawings , is required to move the locking member out of its position with the inner adjacent surface of the second arm portion 3, to allow for both location and removal of for example a connector 1 within the closure space 4. It will be appreciated from Figure 2 of the drawings that ends of the closure member 5 are turned inwardly as at 5a, which ends 5a engage with offset holes or slots 7, provided in the first arm portion 2 and preferably in a lower portion of the first arm portion 2. This then causes the locking member 5 to be resiliently biased against the inner surface 3a of the second arm portion 3. This resilient location, which requires a positive and upward movement against the bias, to move the locking member out of position, makes it very difficult for animals, people, children and the like to move the locking member 5 out of position, although a positive movement does allow for such removal, and thus predetermined use and normal operation is not hindered. The preferred embodiment of the invention does however overcome the problems as associated with animals and children, up until this time. It should be appreciated that modifications and improvements may be made to this invention without departing from the scope thereof. It is to be clearly understood that there are no particular features of the foregoing specification, or of any claims appended hereto, which are at present regarded as being essential to the performance of the present invention, and that any one or more of such features or combinations thereof may therefore be included in, added to, omitted from or deleted from any of such claims if and when amended during the prosecution of this application or in the filing or prosecution of any divisional application based thereon.
