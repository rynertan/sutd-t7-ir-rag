## Description
CATALYST PROCESS FOR ITS PRODUCTION AND ITS US IN THE CONVERSION OF SYNGAS TO METHANOL The present invention relates to a catalyst for use in a process for the production of methanol from synthesis gas, a process for the production of the catalyst and a process for the production of methanol utilising the catalyst. Metal or metal oxide catalysts have long been known to catalyse processes for the production of oxygenated compounds, for example alcohols, from synthesis gas. Furthermore, copper and thorium have long been recognised as active components of such catalysts. See, for example, US Patents Nos. 1,707,331, 2,061,470 2,500,913 1,741,307 1,625,929 and 1,831,179. US Patent No. 1,625,929 describes a methanol catalyst which comprises three main elements, i.e. 1 one or more difficultly reducible metal oxides such as zinc, magnesium, cadmium, chromium, vanadium, tungsten, uranium, zirconium, titanium, aluminium, manganese, molybdenum, thorium, cerium, etc., 2 one or more easily reducible metal oxides such as copper, silver, iron, nickel, cobalt, etc., 3 a metallic halide. The improvement in such catalysts is ascribed to the presence of the halide. US Patent No. 1,707,331 describes a catalyst for the production of methanol from hydrogen and carbon monoxide which comprises copper and a rare earth metal fluoride. Suitable rare earth metals are defined as thorium, scandium, lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium and samarium. Example 11, of this patent describes the preparation of a copper thorium fluoride supported on asbestos catalyst by a hot precipitation method. US Patent No. 1,741,307 describes a process of reducing carbon monoxide and carbon monoxide containing gases which comprises causing the gas to react with hydrogen containing gases in successive stages to form formaldehyde and methyl alcohol without isolating intermediate products formed, at least one of the first two stages taking place in the presence of mild reduction catalysts associated with oxidation catalysts, the latter acting as carrier for the former. Mild reduction catalysts include copper, manganese, cadmium, zinc, lead, tin, magnesium, silver, gold and platinum and oxidation catalysts include compounds of chromium, vanadium, manganese, titanium, molybdenum, tungsten, cerium, thorium, uranium, zirconium and the like.In Example 2 of this patent there is described a process producing methanol using a layered catalyst in which one component 2 is thorium oxide coated with copper and zinc produced by evaporating complex ammonium salts of copper and zinc nitrate on the thorium oxide fragments. US Patent No. 1,831,179 describes a similar process to the stagewise process of US Patent No. 1,741,307. In Example I of this patent the catalyst used in the first stage reaction of carbon dioxide with hydrogen to produce carbon monoxide and water consists of 100 parts pure copper carbonate on 1000 parts thorium oxide fragments, the copper carbonate being stuck on with dextrin and reduced at 2800C in a stream of hydrogen. US Patent No. 2,061,470 describes the production of methanol from synthesis gas using a catalyst consisting of a reduction product of a fused mixture of copper oxide and manganese oxide, or copper oxide and zinc oxide, in which there is incorporated one or more of the elements magnesium, aluminium, chromium, zirconium, vanadium, titanium, thorium, silicon and cerium. Example 7 of this patent describes a catalyst consisting of 78 parts of pure cupric oxide, 20 parts of pure manganese dioxide and 2 parts of pure thorium oxide. US Patent No. 2,500,913 describes oxo synthesis catalysts prepared by impregnating a gel comprising silica with salts of cobalt, thorium and copper. Of the aforesaid catalysts, only that of US Patent No.1,707,331 is prepared by a precipitation technique and that involves precipitation from a hot solution. Finally, US Patent No. 4,298,354 describes a process for producing alcohol mixtures which comprises contacting a gaseous reactant containing carbon monoxide and hydrogen with an oxide complex catalyst described by the formula CuaThMbAcOx whereinM is one or more of Ca,Mo,Rh,Mn,Pt,Ce,Cr,Zn,Al,Ti,La,V,U,Ru,Re and Pd A is an alkali metal and wherein a is 0.5 to 2.5 b is 0.01 to 1.0 c is 0.05 to 0.9 and x is a number such that the valence requirements of the other elements for oxygen is satisfied. The catalyst of US Patent No. 4,298,354 is prepared by a procedure involving adding an alkali metal carbonate to an aqueous solution containing decomposable salts of thorium, copper and the H element, preferably maintained at an elevated temperature, e.g.80 to 950C, until the pH of the system increases to at least 7.5, preferably at least 8, most preferably about 9.3 to 10, digesting the precipitate whilst maintaining the temperature, acidifying to pH 6.8 to 7, separating and washing the precipitate, drying the precipitate and thereafter calcining the precipitate at a temperature sufficient to drive out the remaining water and decompose the decomposable ions remaining therein. In Example 1 and subsequent Examples the precipitation step is carried out at a temperature of 90 950C. The present invention provides a process for the production of a catalyst precursor for use after reductive activation in the conversion of synthesis gas to methanol, the precursor having the formula CuaThAbOx I wherein A is an alkali metal, a is from 0.1 to 4 b is from 0 to 0.5, and x is a number such that the valence requirements of the other elements for oxygen is satisfied which process comprises the steps of I precipitating at a temperature below 50 C the metals copper and thorium in the form of insoluble thermally decomposable compounds thereof using a precipitant comprising a carbonate and or bicarbonate of an alkali metal and or ammonium, the pH being adjusted to a final value in the range from 5.0 to 7.0, II recovering the precipitate obtained in step I , and FIZZ thermally decomposing heat decomposable compounds comprised in the precipitate recovered in step II , the maximum temperature utilised in the thermal decomposition being in the range from 300 to 6000C. Preferably a in the formula I has a value in the range from 0.5 to 3, even more preferably from 0.7 to 2. Preferably b in the formula I has a value less than 0.15, even more preferably zero. Other metals M may be incorporated in the catalyst precursor of formula I , some with advantageous effects. Suitable metals M include Mo,Rh,Mn,Pt,Ce,Cr,Zn, Al,Ti,La,V,U,Ru,Re,Pd,Ag, Au and akaline earth metals, for example Ca. The metals M may be incorporated in amounts up to 20 w w. After reductive activation, the product of the process of the invention is an excellent methanol production catalyst. Very high methanol space time yields and methanol selectivities as high as 99X can be achieved. Moreover, the catalyst is resistant to decay and is very reproducible. By comparison, a catalyst produced by precipitation at more elevated temperatures, for example 900 C, but under otherwise identical conditions is very much less active for methanol production. Step I of the aforesaid process may be accomplished in a variety of ways, some being better than others in terms of the activity of the final catalyst. Thus, an embodiment A comprises bringing together in solution at a temperature below 500C soluble salts of the metals copper and thorium and a precipitant comprising a carbonate and or a bicarbonate of an alkali metal and or ammonium, the pH being adjusted to a final value in the range from 5.0 to 7.0.Alternatively, an embodiment B comprises bringing together in a substantially copper free solution a soluble thorium salt with a precipitant so as to precipitate a thorium compound and thereafter in the presence of the precipitated thorium compound bringing together a solution of a soluble copper salt with a precipitant so as to precipitate an insoluble thermally decomposable compound, the pH being adjusted to a final value in the range from 5.0 to 7.0, said precipitations being carried out at a temperature below 500C and said precipitant comprising a carbonate and or a bicarbonate of an alkali metal and or ammonium. After precipitation of the thorium compound, the solution of the soluble copper salt may suitably be added to the precipitated thorium compound without any intervening treatment, such as for example filtration, prior to precipitating the copper compound.Alternatively, the precipitated thorium compound may be separated, washed and re dispersed prior to precipitating the copper compound. Many variants on the aforesaid embodiments A and B are possible, for example instead of adding the precipitant to the salts, the salts may be added to the precipitant. Whilst any soluble salt of copper and thorium may be employed, such as for example carboxylates, acetyl acetonates, naphthenates, chlorides and the like, it is preferred to use the nitrates. It is preferred to use aqueous solutions of the salts, though aqueous alcoholic solutions for example may be employed if desired. Of the alkali metals sodium and potassium are suitable, principally for reasons of availability and cost. Examples of suitable precipitants are sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate, ammonium carbonate and ammonium bicarbonate. Using alkali metal salts as the precipitant, the resulting catalyst precursor composition will almost certainly contain alkali metal cations, the amount of which may be reduced by washing or may be increased by further addition of alkali metal cations. However, we have found that catalysts free from alkali metal b in the formula I equal to zero are the most active and for this reason it is preferred to use either ammonium carbonate or ammonium bicarbonate, even more preferably ammonium bicarbonate, as the precipitant.Ammonium carbonate may suitably be used in a commercially available form, which comprises a mixture of ammonium bicarbonate and ammonium carbonate. The use of ammonium bicarbonate as the precipitant unexpectedly provides the most active of the catalysts embraced within the scope of the present invention. The precipitation may suitably be effected at a temperature below 300C, even more preferably at a temperature in the range fromO to 250C. Precipitation at room temperature will usually be found most convenient. The amounts of the soluble copper and thorium salts and precipitant employed should be such as to satisfy the values of a and b in the formula I . In order to improve the homogeneity of the catalyst it is preferred to agitate the mixture during precipitation, suitably by mechanical stirring. Addition of the precipitant causes the initially low pH to rise. Generally, it will be found that precipitation of the thorium compound is substantially complete at a pH of about 4. It is important in the precipitation of the copper component of the catalysts that the final value of the pH is in the range from 5.0 to 7.0, preferably from 5.5 to 6.5, even more preferably from 5.9 to 6.3. The steps taken prior to achieving the final pH may vary considerably. Thus, the precipitant may be added until a pH in the aforesaid range is achieved, whereupon the addition of a further precipitant may be discontinued, thereby arresting the rise in the pH.Alternatively, the rise in pH may be allowed to continue by further addition of precipitant until it reaches a value in the range from 9 to 10 at which point it will generally be found that precipitation is complete and the pH of the mixture thereafter adjusted to a final value in the aforesaid range by addition of acid. In another alternative, the pH of the mixture may be maintained at a value in the aforesaid range by the addition of a suitable buffer. It is believed that the precipitate resulting from the process of the invention involving precipitation from the metal nitrates at a temperature below 50 C and especially below 30 C contains a crystalline phase comprising copper in the form of the basic carbonate, whereas the copper in the crystalline phase of the precipitate obtained by precipitation at more elevated temperatures comprises the copper hydroxy nitrate. It is further preferred to carry out step I in an atmosphere of carbon dioxide. Though we do not wish to be bound in any way by theory, it is believed that the presence of carbon dioxide may stabilise any carbonate phase and improve the dispersion of the metallic phases in the composition. In step Il of the process of the invention the precipitate obtained in step I is recovered. This may suitably be accomplished by filtration but other methods for separating solids from liquids, for example centrifugation, may be employed. After recovery, it is preferred to wash the precipitate, suitably with water, so as to remove unwanted residual soluble matter. Thereafter, the precipitate may be dried, suitably at an elevated temperature below 1500C, for example about 1200C. In step III of the process according to the invention heat decomposable compounds comprised in the precipitate recovered in step II are thermally decomposed. The maximum temperature used during the thermal decomposition must not exceed a temperature in the range from 300 to 600 C, preferably from 400 to 500 C, even more preferably from 440 to 4600C. The rate at which the temperature is increased may be varied over a wide range. It is preferred to maintain the precipitate at the maximum temperature for an extended period, for example from 1 to 200 hours. It is preferred to conduct the decomposition in a nonreducing atmosphere, suitably in a stream of either an inert gas, for example nitrogen, or an oxygen containing gas, for example, air. After decomposition the product comprises a metal oxide composition convertible by reductive activation into a catalyst for the conversion of synthesis gas to methanol. Catalyst precursor compositions obtained using ammonium bicarbonate as the precipitant compositions of formula I in which b 0 may be reductively activated in a reducing gas comprising carbon monoxide, for example in carbon monoxide hydrogen containing mixtures. This affords the advantage that precursor compositions so derived can be reductively activated within a methanol production reactor using the same or different reaction conditions to those employed in the methanol production process. For catalyst precursor compositions other than those referred to hereinabove, ie b in formula I greater than zero, reductive activation is preferably effected, at least initially, with reducing gas substantially free from carbon monoxide, for example hydrogen preferably diluted with inert gas. A very suitable gas mixture is 5 hydrogen in nitrogen. Following initial reduction with a reducing gas other than carbon monoxide, subsequent reduction may be effected in carbon monoxide containing gases, for example carbon monoxide hydrogen mixtures. Suitably reductive activation in this manner may be carried out as a discrete step prior to use as a catalyst for methanol production, either prior to loading into a methanol production reactor or within a methanol production reactor. The pressure employed during the reductive activation step may suitably be in the range from 1 to 100 bar, the temperature may suitably be in the range from 170 to 250 C and periods of 24 hours or longer may be employed. We have found that a characteristic of active catalysts is a relatively high proportion of elemental copper particles of a size less than or equal to 20 Angstroms. Accordingly, in another aspect the present invention comprises a catalyst composition for use in the conversion of synthesis gas to methanol which composition comprises elemental copper and an oxide of thorium in the atomic ratio CuaThOx Il wherein x is a number such that the valence requirements of Th for oxygen is satisfied, and a is in the range from 0.1 to 4, and wherein at least 30 of the elemental copper particles are of a size less than or equal to 20 Angstroms. The activity of the catalyst is related to the absolute amount of elemental copper particles of size less than or equal to 20Angstroms and in consequence for any particular composition as high a proportion as possible of elemental copper particles of size less than or equal to 20 Angstroms is desirable. Preferably at least 50X, even more preferably at least 90 of the elemental copper particles are of size less than or equal to 20Angstroms. Preferably a in the formula II has a value in the range from 0.5 to 3, even more preferably from 0.7 to 2. According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a process for the production of methanol from synthesis gas which process comprises contacting synthesis gas with a catalyst as hereinbefore described at a temperature in the range from 80 to 3000C and a pressure of from 0 to 100 bars. As is well known in the art synthesis gas principally comprises carbon monoxide and hydrogen and possibly also minor amounts of carbon dioxide, nitrogen and other inert gases depending upon its origin and degree of purity. Methods for preparing synthesis gas are established in the art and usually involve the partial oxidation of a carbonaceous substance, e.g. coal. Alternatively, synthesis gas may be prepared, for example by the catalytic steam reforming of methane. For the purpose of the present invention the carbon monoxide to hydrogen ratio may suitably be in the range from 2 1 to 1 8, preferably from 1 1 to 1 3, even more preferably 1 2.Whilst the ratio of the carbon monoxide to hydrogen in the synthesis gas produced by the aforesaid processes may differ from these ranges, it may be altered appropriately by the addition of either carbon monoxide or hydrogen, or may be adjusted by the so called shift reaction well known to those skilled in the art. It may be preferred to remove carbon dioxide from the synthesis gas, suitably by scrubbing, prior to contact of the synthesis gas with the catalyst. The synthesis gas is contacted with the catalyst at a temperature in the range from 80 to 3000C. Operation of the process at temperatures above 300 C tends to produce increasing amounts of higher alochols in addition to gaseous products, thereby decreasing the selectivity to methanol. It is preferred to operate at a temperature in the range from 180 to 2500C for the highest selectivities to methanol. Preferably the operating pressure is in the range from 20 to 100 bars. The Gas Hourly Space Velocity GHSV may be varied over a wide range, for example in the range from 1000 to 350,000 hour l. The process may suitably be operated either in fluid bed mode or fixed bed mode, and either batchwise or continuously, preferably continuously. The catalyst may additionally contain materials, for example alumina or chromia, conventionally added for the purpose of dilution, controlling pellet density and providing other mechanical requirements, such as for example inhibition of shrinkage and abrasion resistance. These materials may be added at any convenient stage of catalyst preparation. The invention will now be further illustrated by reference to the following Examples. For the purpose of Examples 21 to 23, and 31 to 38, andComparison Tests 4, 6 and 7, the tubular reactor illustrated inFigure 1 was employed. With reference to Figure 1, 1 is a stainless steel tube of 8mm internal diameter, there being supported around the reactor in slotted rings a recorder thermocouple 2 and a controller thermocouple 3, which thermocouples in conjunction with aCRL controller and Honeywell Brown recorder neither of which are shown are used to control and monitor the temperature of the carbolite model CJT1 1000 split furnace 4. Synthesis gas entering the tubular reactor first encounters silica spheres 5 which act as a preheater, followed by the catalyst 6, a ceramic wool plug 7 and finally stainless steel gauze 8 before exiting from the reactor. The reactor fits into the unit layout in the manner shown in Figure 2. With reference to Figure 2, the principal features are a Brooks mass flow controller 9, a hydrogen by pass 10, the reactor assembly of Figure 1, knock out pots 11 and 12, a three way valve 13 and a pressure controller 14.

With reference to Figure 3, 15 is a stainless steel tube of 7mm internal diameter, 16 is a stainless steel thermowell of 2.5mm internal diameter with a recorder thermocouple 17 positioned down its centre. A controller thermocouple 18 is positioned in a slotted ring parallel to the reactor tube. These thermocouples in conjunction with a euro them controller and a CRL recorder neither of which are shown are used to control and monitor the temperature of the Stanton Redcroft low mass horizontal furnace 19. Synthesis gas entering the tubular reactor first encounters a ceramic wool plug 20, followed by the catalyst 21 and finally another ceramic wool plug 22 before exiting from the reactor. The reactor assembly of Figure 3 fits into the unit layout in the manner shown in Figure 4. With reference to Figure 4, gases are introduced to the plant from cylinders through a pressure regulator 23, and the flow rates are controlled by post reactor needle valves 24 and 25. Flow is measured by bubble meters on both the reactor vent and the G.C. vent. A trap pot is available for product sampling when required.Preparation of Catalyst PrecursorsExample 1 Catalyst Precursor A precipitation at low temperature Copper nitrate, Cu N03 23H20 120g and thorium nitrate, Th N03 44H20 l8Og were dissolved in distilled water 3000 ml .Potassium carbonate 207.3g, anhydrous was dissolved in distilled water 1500ml and the resulting solution was added dropwise with stirring to the copper thorium solution at room temperature ca 20 C .

This is not an example according to the present invention because the copper was not precipitated.Example 11 Catalyst Precursor M Copper nitrate, Cu N03 2.3H20, 24.0g, 99.3 mmoles and thorium nitrate, Th N03 4.6H20, 36.0g, 61.2 mmoles were dissolved in deionised water 600 ml to form Solution W. Ammonium bicarbonate NH4HC03, 47.6g, 598 mmoles was dissolved in deionised water 300 ml and this solution was added dropwise at a rate of Sml minute with stirring to Solution W at room temperature until the pH reached a value of 6. Stirring was continued for a further 15 minutes and the suspension filtered. The filter cake was washed by immersion in deionised water 300 ml , stirred for 15 minutes and filtered. The washing operation was carried out a total of three times. The product was then dried at llO C for 17 hours. Finally, the dry product was decomposed in the manner described in Example 8 for Catalyst Precursor I . The thorium was not precipitated in the substantial absence of copper. In this respect it differs from Example 8.Example 12 Catalyst Precursor N Example 11 was repeated except that the composition was changed in the respect that the amount of copper nitrate was reduced to 14.8g 61.3 mmoles . The thorium was not precipitated in the substantial absence of copper. In this respect it differs from Example 9.Example 13 Catalyst Precursor 0 precipitation with ammonium hydrogen carbonate Copper nitrate, Cu N03 2.3H20, 14.8g, 61.3 mmol and thorium nitrate, Th N03 4.6H20, 36.0g, 61.2 mmol were dissolved in deionised water 600 ml to form Solution X. Ammonium hydrogen carbonate, NH4HC03, 47.6g, 600 mmol was dissolved in deionised water Solution Y . This solution, i.e. Solution Y, was added dropwise at room temperature to the vigorosly stirred Solution X until a pH of 6.0 was reached. After continuing the stirring for 15 minutes, the suspension was filtered. The filter cake was washed by immersing in deionised water 600 mols . This washing operation was carried out three times in all. The final solid cake was then dried at llO C for 17 hours. The product was then broken down to pass 16 but not 30 mesh BSS . The new product was then decomposed by a programmed heat treatment in a flow of nitrogen. The temperature was raised from ambient to 45O0C at 1200C per hour and then maintained at 45O0C for 6 hours.Example 14 Catalyst Precursor P This was prepared in an identical manner to Catalyst Precursor 0 in Example 13 using as Solution X a mixture of the nitrates, Cu N03 2.3H2O 24.0g, 99.3 mmol , Ce NO3 3.6H20 1.3g, 3.1 mmol and Th N03 4.6H20 36.0g, 61.2 mmol .Example 15 Catalyst Precursor Q thermal decomposition at 3000 C The procedure of Example 1 Catalyst Precursor A was repeated excepted that, after drying, a portion of the dry solid was thermally decomposed in air by raising the temperature rapidly to 50 C and then in a programmed manner at 300C h to 300 C and held at that temperature for 6h.Example 16 Catalyst Precursor R thermal decomposition at 4000 C A further portion of the dry solid obtained in Example 15 was thermaly decomposed in the manner described in Example 15 except that the final temperature was 4000C instead of 3000C.Example 17 Catalyst Precursor S thermal decompostion at 4500C A further portion of the dry solid obtained in Example 15 was thermally decomposed in the manner described in Example 15 except that the final temperature was 45O0C instead of 3O00C. Example 18 Catalyst Precursor T thermal decomposition at 5000 C A final portion of the dry solid obtained in Example 15 was thermally decomposed in the manner described in Example 15 except that the final temperature was 5O00C instead of 300 C. Example 19 Catalyst Precursor U The procedure of Example 1 Catalyst Precursor A was employed except the thermal decomposition of the dried solid was accomplished at 450 C, the temperature having been raised rapidly to 500C and then in a programmed manner at 3O0C h to 45O0C at which temperature it was held for 6h.Example 20 Catalyst Precursor V Copper nitrate, Cu N03 2.3H2O, 48.0g, 198.6 mmole was dissolved in deionised water 40 ml to form a solution designatedX. Thorium nitrate, Th N03 4.6H2O, 72.0g, 122.4 mmole , was dissolved in deionised water 120 ml to form a solution designatedY. This solution was kept saturated with carbon dioxide gas throughout the preparation. Ammonium bicarbonate, NH4HC03, 95.2g, 1196 mmole was dissolved in deionised water 600 ml and this solution was added dropwise at a rate of 10 ml minute with stirring to solution Y at room temperature until the pH reached a value of 4, at which point the addition was stopped. Stirring was continued for a further 15 minutes and thereafter solution X was added to the suspension.To this solution was added further ammonium bicarbonate solution in the same manner as before until the pH reached a value of 6. Stirring was continued for a further 15 minutes and the suspension was then filtered. The filter cake was washed three times in the manner hereinbefore described. The product was then decomposed in the manner described in Example 8.Conversion of catalyst precursors into catalysts and testing of catalysts so obtained A Effect of variations in step I of the process of the inventionExample 21 Catalyst A With reference to Figures 1 and 2, Catalyst Precursor A was packed into the reactor illustrated in Figure 1 and reductively activated by passage of 5t hydrogen in nitrogen at 1700C for 16h, the temperature having been raised to 17O0C over a period of lh. Thereafter, the flow of H2 N2 was cut off and carbon monoxide and hydrogen were fed from cylinders in a ratio of C0 H2 1 2 molar to the reactor via pressure control valves and Brooks thermal mass flow controllers 9. The inlet pressure was indicated by a gauge and the plant was protected against overpressure by a bursting disc. The system was pressurised to 50 bars over 30 minutes. At that pressure the flows were settled out at a GHSV of 7000h 1. Gaseous products passing from the reactor were fed through heated lines and a selector valve 13 to one of two traps 11 and 12 arranged in parallel. The two traps were cooled in solid carbon dioxide cardice acetone to 5 to 100C, one trap being used for the running in period and the other for the balanced run. Gases leaving these traps were fed first to a pressure controller 14 in which the pressure was dropped to atmospheric and then to a gasmeter, a sampling point and finally to vent. After one hour, when steady running conditions had been achieved, the selector valve 13 was switched and a run of one hour duration was carried out collecting the liquid product in the previously unused cold trap. The vent gas was measured by a gasmeter and a vent gas sample was taken during the run. Liquid and gaseous products were analysed by gas chromatography. The result in terms of methanol productivity is shown in Table 1.Comparison Test 4 Catalyst B The procedure of Example 21 was repeated except that CatalystPrecursor B was used in place of Catalyst Precursor A.

The catalyst was reductively activated by passage of 5 hydrogen in nitrogen at 17O0C for 16h, the temperature having been raised to 1700C over a period of 1 hour. After reductive activation, the flow of H2 N2 was cut off and a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen in a molar ratio of CO H2 of 1 2 was fed at a GHSV of 100,000 h l to the reactor maintained at a temperature of 2000C and an absolute pressure of 50 bars. Effluent gas was carried in heated lines 200 C to a PyeUnicam Gas Chromatographic Detector, with a 2ml sampling loop. Using helium as a carrier gas, products were separated with a 2 metre column of Porapak Q at 1120 C. This gave good separation ofCO, C02, H20 and MeOH. Calibration was carried out by the injection of 0.5 microlitre aliquots of liquid methanol. A Pye Unicam D4810 integrator was used to measure the peak areas. The typical methanol retention time on this column was 25 ops. The result in terms of methanol productivity is given in Table 4.Example 25 The procedure of Example 24 was repeated except that instead ofCatalyst Precursor E there was used a catalyst precursor prepared in identical manner to Catalyst Precursor A as described in Example 1, i.e. using potassium carbonate as the precipitant.
