# Smoking articles having a reduced free burn time.

## Abstract
This invention relates to smoking articles having re duced free burn time, including cigarettes, cigars and little cigars. The smoking article comprises tobacco wrapped in a paper having at least one circumferential band printed between the ends of the smoking article preferably at about the center of the smoking article. The band contains a substance which will cause the smoking article to extinguish in about 2 5 minutes under free burn conditions after the cone reaches the banded area if it is not puffed. The band is typically about 2 10 mm wide containing a substance which is a liquid in the temperature range of about 100 C to 200 C and which as the burning cone comes in contact with it provides a fluid film on the paper, without substantially penetrating through the surface of the paper, which film is substantially impervious to air and decomposes and or distills endothermically from about 140 C to 300 C to yield gaseous decomposition products normally present in the smoke of smoking articles with the band. The amount of the substance used in the band should be sufficient to extinguish the smoking articles under free burn conditions within 2 5 minutes.
