# SEMICONDUCTOR LASERS

## Abstract
In order to narrow the far field of the light output from a multilayer semiconductor laser structure in a direction perpendicular to the layers, whilst maintaining a high confinement factor, a thin layer 6,7 is interposed between the active layer 1 and a conventional light confining layer 4, 5 . The thin layer is of a lower refractive index than the light confining layer, which in turn is of a lower refractive index than the active layer.
