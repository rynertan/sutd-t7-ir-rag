## Description
PERMANENT MAGNET ALLOY The present invention relates to permanent magnets of R2Col7 type crystal structure. It is known in the production of rare earth cobalt permanent magnets R Co that iron may be used to replace a significant portion of the cobalt when zirconium is added to the composition. It is also known that additions of copper may be made to compositions of this type. However, with a copper addition the residual magnetization saturation induction is decreased.Likewise as iron is increased there is a corresponding reduction in coercive force. It is accordingly a primary object of the present invention to provide a permanent magnet alloy containing at least one rare earth element, preferably samarium, cobalt, iron and copper wherein an optimum combination of coercive force and residual magnetization is achieved. A more specific object of the invention is to provide a permanent magnet alloy of this type wherein copper is reduced and replaced by a zirconium addition, whereby an optimum combination of coercive force and residual magnetization may be achieved. The present invention provides a permanent magnet of R2Col7 type crystal structure consisting of, in percent by weight, at least one rare earth element within the range of 24 to 28, cobalt within the range of 48 to 53, copper within the range of 2 to 4.9 to less than 5, iron within the range of 18 to 30 and zirconium within the range of 1.7 to 3.0. Broadly in the practice of the invention the permanent magnet is of an alloy of the general formula R2Co17 wherein R is at least one rare earth component, preferably samarium, and the Co component is cobalt. The alloy, in weight percent, consists of at least one rare earth element, preferably samarium, within the range of 24 to 28, cobalt within the range of 48 to 53, copper within the range of 2 to 4.9, iron within the range of 18 to 30 and zirconium within the range 1.7 to 3.0. By maintaining copper at an amount less than 5E and addinq zirconium within the above stated range, the adverse affect of copper with regard to residual magnetization is eliminated and thus an optimum combination of coercive force and residual magnetization is achieved. As specific examples of the practice of the invention the following alloy compositions were employed Weiaht, Percent Alloy Sm Co Cu Fe Zr A 25.6 49.9 3.8 18.6 1.7 B 25.1 48.7 3.9 19.7 2.6 Commercial Alloy 25.6 50.4 5.9 14.7 2.4 The alloys were produced by induction melting and casting, whereupon they were then crushed and ball milled to a particle size within the range of 5 to 10 microns.The powder was then oriented in a magnetic field and samples thereof were both pressed by a pulsating magnetic field in combination with hot isostatic pressing and also by die pressing in a transverse magnetic field.Thereafter, the magnets were heat treated at 1200 C for I hour, cooled for 2 hours to 11500C and held at this temperature for 5 hours, quenched, and then heated to 8500C and aged for 17 hours, cooled for 13 hours to 4000C, held at 4000C for I hour to 10 hours, and then quenched. Hysteresis loops were measured on these magnets and the results are set forth in TABLE I.
