## Description
LOW VISCOSITY GAS DE IYDRATING AGENTS AND GAS SWEETENING AGENTS This invention concerns low viscosity gas dehydrating agents and gas sweetening agents. The gas conditioning industry has long used the glycols ethylene, diethylene, triethylene and tetraethylene glycols to dehydrate both natural and synthetic gases. In addition, some processes use both a high efficiency liquid desiccant and a sweetening agent acid gas absorbent such as an alkanolamine to accomplish dehydration and sweetening in a single contactor. These desiccants and sweetening agents for the most part become viscous liquids at temperatures below about 750F 24 C . Such increase in viscosity affects both the mass transfer rate of water into the desiccant and or the transfer rate of the acid gases into the sweetening agents as well as the hydraulics of the gas liquid contactor. Further, higher viscosities affect the wetting efficiency in packed columns. A very desirable desiccant, from its theoretical ability to pick up water from gases is glycerine. However, it has a very high viscosity even at 980F 370C and is seldom used. In the new gas fields in the polar regions and higher latitude oceans the problems of viscosity are increased because while the gas producing formation may be, as it often is in the lower 48 states, at 300 to 4000F 150 to 200 C , bottom hole temperature, however by the time the gas reaches the surface and is transported to the treating site, it often is at temperatures in the range of the ambient atmosphere near or below zero in the northern latitudes, to less than 400F 4 C even in Texas during the winter months .Such temperatures of the gas relative to the absorbent liquid temperature at the absorber inlet, quickly cool the absorbent to near gas temperature, the volume of gas being great as compared to the absorbent volume, cools the absorbent rapidly with little temperature rise in the gas. Thus, it would be useful to have highly efficient liquid desiccants and sweetening agents which would exhibit viscosities lower than those of the glycols and alkanolamines at low temperatures as well as lower viscosities at the more conventional ambient site temperatures. In accordance with the present invention it has been found that conventional liquid desiccants, such as, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, and tetraethylene glycols, acid gas absorbents, such as the alkanolamines, sulfolane, and the less conventional desiccant glycerine, as well as mixtures of these agents, can be made less viscious by adding at least 0.5 to 20 percent by weight of one or a mixture of propylene carbonate and or a glycol ether, such as dipropylene glycol monomethyl ether having a boiling point above 2000F 900C , and from 0 to 1 percent by weight water associated therewith.Thus one can add to an alkanolamine or a mixture of the desiccants and or a mixture of the desiccant and sweetening agent from 0.5 to 25 weight percent of a low temperature viscosity control agent soluble in the desiccant, sweetening agent or mixture thereof which will not precipitate out at low temperatures that is to reduce the viscosity at about 400F 40C more than 25 percent less than that calculC.able by combining said desiccant sweetening agent and said viscosity improver.Further, glycerine s viscosity can be lowered by adding a glycol or a mixture of glycol and propylene carbonate.It was somewhat surprising to find that these particular additives reduced the viscosity to a greater extent than one would normally expect from knowledge of the technology of viscosity improvers. Thus, one can add propylene carbonate or dipropylene glycol monomethyl ether to a desiccant triethyleneglycol a sweetening agent monoethanolamine a desiccant sweetening agent mixture e.g. a glycol and methyl diethanolamine mixture glycerine or, to a 50 50 glycerine triethylene glycol desiccant mixture. Specifically, the present invention concerns a low viscosity composition and improved process for gas conditioning. A composition useful in dehydrating and or sweetening natural and synthetic gases by c√èntact with a liquid desiccant, liquid sweetening agent or mixture of desiccant and sweetening agent which comprises 1 a liquid desiccant and or sweetening agent selected from the group consisting of ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol, alkanolamines, sulfolane, and glycerine 2 a low temperature viscosity improver selected from the group consisting of a a glycol ether having a boiling point above 2000F 900C b propylene carbonate c mixtures thereof provided that when glycerine is a component of said desiccant sweetening agent then a glycol or mixture of a glycol and propylene carbonate is present, and d from 0 to 1 by weight of water. In a process for dehydrating and or sweetening wet and or sour natural or synthetic gases by contacting said gas with a desiccant, sweetening agent or desiccant sweetening agent selected from the group consisting of glycols, polyglycols, glycerine, alkanolamines and sulfolane, wherein the agent is regenerated by heating to drive off the absorbed water and or said sour acid gases, the improvement comprises adding to said agent from 0.5 to 25 percent by weight of a low temperature viscosity improver selected from the group consisting of glycol ethers boiling above about 2000F 900C , propylene carbonate, mixtures thereof, and for glycerine the added combination of a glycol, propylene carbonate or mixtures thereof, thereby to reduce the viscosity at about 400F 40C more than about 25 percent less than that calculable by combining said desiccant sweetening agent and said viscosity improver. These viscosity improver additives are stable at the conventional regeneration temperature 3500 4000F 175 2000C employed to strip the desiccant of water preparatory for reuse in the absorber section of a process or to strip the acid gas absorbents of both water and the acid gases preparatory to their recycling to the absorber. Since these latter additives do not affect the water absorbing capacity of the more conventional desiccants, their addition does not materially affect the economics of the processes nor the dehydra tion ability of the conventional desiccant or acid gas absorbing capability of the sweetening agents. While other well known viscosity improvers may be thought useful, unless they have the requisite properties to remain with the desiccant or sweetening agent on regeneration, they would be lost or, if recoverable, require additional equipment. For example, methanol is a well known hydrate inhibitor and could act as a viscosity improver for the desiccants but its vapor pressure is such that it would have to be recovered and reintroduced after each cycle of the absorbent.Further, the lower glycol ethers are subject to the same criticism. The lower viscosities attributable to these additives in most instances improve the fluid dynamics of the absorber and regeneration steps thus substantially eliminating any penalty assumed with slightly higher liquid throughputs to maintain gas design capacity for a given absorber or regenerator. In addition, being able to operate at low gas liquid contact temperatures, an existing dehydration plant, for example, can operate at increased capacity because the gas volume, a function of temperature and pressure, will be less and thus total throughput can be increased. If low temperatures can be tolerated, new plant designs can be smaller. It is also possible to obtain drier gas when low temperature operations are employed since the gas at absorber overhead conditions will contain less water due to the vapor liquid equilibrium. Additionally, the lower temperatures dictate that the inlet gas will contain less water needing removal. In the following examples, the percent are by weight unless otherwise stated. These examples are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.Example 1 The viscosity at 650F 180C and 980F 370C were measured for a number of mixtures of the four conventional glycol desiccants, glycerine and the alkanolamine sweetening agents.
