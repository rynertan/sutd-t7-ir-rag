# Lighting unit for liquids.

## Abstract
A lighting unit for liquids comprises a tubular member 1 with a flange 3 at one end and a screwthread 2 at the other whereby it can be secured in the wall of a vessel to hold liquid. A holder engaged in the rear end of the tubular member 1 holds a bulb such as an automobile head lamp bulb, and a lens 5 is mounted in a recess 4 in the front end of the tubular member 1 . The lens 5 has a convex front face 33 , a concave rear face 30 and a negative focal length and, with the light mounted close to the rear of the lens, gives a very wide angle of illumination. The angle may for example be 172 and the tubular member 1 may be of only 7cm diameter.
