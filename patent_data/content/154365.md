# Cement mixing process and apparatus.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a process for improving the characteristics of a fluid and in particular of a cement slurry for the cementing of wells, particularly of oil wells, wherein it consists in applying to this fluid an energy of between 4.8 and 6.3 kJ kg, by incorporating adapted pressure drops, in line, before the well head and at the outlet of a high pressure pump, said pressure drops being substantially independent of the flowrate. The invention also relates to a device for carrying out this process.
