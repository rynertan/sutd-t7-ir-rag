## Description
This invention relates to oral hygiene compositions and to polymers active therein to prevent or inhibit attachment of bacteria to teeth. The prevention of the adherent deposition of dental plaque on mammalian particularly human teeth is a highly desired result. Dental plaque results when cariogenic and other types of bacteria aggregate in colonies on the surface of teeth and form a deposit thereon which adheres tenaciously to the surface. It is believed that the formation of plaque on the surface of a tooth is one of the first steps in the development of dental caries and periodontal disease. Many attempts have been made to prevent the deposition of plaque on tooth surfaces and to effect removal of plaque from such surfaces. For example, fluoride, brushing and dental flossing treatments have been tried. Such treatments are typically directed to counteracting the secondary effects of plaque on the teeth and gums, or to the removal of plaque that is formed on and adhering to the teeth and surrounding tissue. Such treatments are not, however, entirely successful and must be supplemented with periodic treatment by dental professionals. Recently it has been proposed that the use of oral compositions which contain certain polymers may be useful in preventing deposition of dental plaque. For example, for such use, certain sulphonated vinyl aromatic polymers are suggested in US 4,375,461 the products of the reaction of long chain aliphatic alkylene amine and trimetaphosphoric acid are suggested in US 4234568 certain bis 4 alkylamino 1 pyridinium alkanes and trimetaphosphoric acid are suggested in US 4234568 certain bis 4 alkylamino 1 pyridinium alkanes are suggested in US 4206215 certain sulphonated polyamino acids are suggested in US 4314991 and copolymers of glutamic acid and tyrosine are suggested in US 4339431. It has also been claimed in US 3542917 that the formation of dental calculus, which is a hard calcified deposit that accumulates on or near tooth surfaces, may be inhibited by treatment of the teeth with a composition containing a polyester of a polycarboxylic acid having 3 to 6 carboxyl groups with a polyalkylene ether having 2 to 4 hydroxyl groups and a molecular weight of 400 to 10,000. In our experience, however, compositions falling within the scope of the claims of US 3542917 are not very effective in preventing the adherent deposition of cariogenic bacteria, or the plaque resulting therefrom, on tooth surfaces. We have now found that certain pharmaceutical compositions as hereinafter defined containing certain polymers also as hereinafter defined are highly effective for preventing or significantly reducing the adherent deposition of cariogenic and other micro organisms commonly found in an oral environment, and also dental plaque resulting therefrom, on tooth surfaces or simulated tooth surfaces made of hydroxyapatite as are mamalian tooth surfaces when the surfaces are treated therewith. According to the present invention there is provided an oral hygiene composition in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable oral hygiene formulation comprising an effective amount of at least one polymer and a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle for said polymer which polymer comprises one or more repeating units of general structure A and one or more repeating units of general structure B wherein X, which in the repeating units of structure A may be the same or different, and Y, which in the repeating units of structure B may be the same or different, are optionally substituted hydrocarbyl residues providing a backbone for the polymer US 4,079,042 and DE 2,063,909 disclose certain polymers which are useful in one or more of the following applications cosmetics, paints, textiles, paper sizes and hair sprays. US 3,956,244 discloses cross linked vinyl acetate maleic anhydride copolymers which are reputedly useful in In structure A, each carboxyl group is joined to the hydrocarbyl residue X by means of an intermediary or intermediaries i.e. by a linking entity or entities , this or these being denoted by L, which is selected from one or more direct links i.e. one or more direct bonds and one or more groups of atoms each group providing a chain of one or more atoms for linking a carboxyl group s with X. In cases where p is 2 to 4, each carboxyl group may be joined by L to the same or, in cases where L represents more than one intermediary, to the same or different carbon atoms in X, although more than 2 carboxyl groups cannot of course be directly linked to the same carbon atom of X and also assuming that in such cases X has at least 2 carbon atoms, whereas it should be appreciated that it is within the scope of the invention for X to have only 1 carbon atom . It will be noted that in principle L can represent up to 4 separate intermediaries in structure A in cases where p is 4 . L may be the same or different in the repeat units of structure A. In cases where L represents one or more groups of atoms each group providing a linking chain of atoms, the chain will normally comprise one or more carbon atoms which could e.g. include carbon atoms in an aryl ring and or hetero atoms particularly N and or 0 . Examples of possible linkages provided by L are where apart from the direct link the top link is to X and the bottom link s is to carboxyl. It is preferred in the present invention, however, that L is one or more direct links, so that each carboxyl group is joined directly to a carbon atom of X in the polymer backbone. It is preferred in structure A that p is 1 or 2 so that L can then represent one, or at most, two intermediaries . In structure B, each CHR¹CHR²0 While M may represent one or more direct links, it is preferred in the present invention that M is one or more groups of atoms each group providing a linking chain of atoms such a chain will normally comprise one or more carbon atoms which could e.g. include carbon atoms in an aryl ring and or hetero atoms particularly N and or 0 . Particularly preferred examples of linkages provided by M are where the top link is to Y and the bottom link is to CHR¹CHR²0 It is preferred in structure B that q is 1 or 2 so that M can then represent one, or at most two intermediaries . Preferably the structure A represents the repeat unit derived from the polymerisation usually free radical initiated of a polymerisable olefinically unsaturated carboxylic acid. Examples of such acids are acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, maleic or fumaric acid, itaconic acid and the acids of formulae respectively giving rise to the following structures for A Particularly preferred acids at our present stage of development are methacrylic, acrylic and maleic acid. Normally the repeat units A will all be of the same specific structure, although the scope of the invention is intended to embrace polymers having repeat units A of more than one specific structure e.g. 2 or 3 different specific structures . Preferably the structure B represents the repeat unit derived from the polymerisation usually free radical initiated of a polymerisable olefinically unsaturated ester or amide formed from the reaction of an unsaturated carboxylic acid or an esterifiable or amidifiable derivative thereof such as an acid chloride or anhydride and a hydroxy compound of formula HO CHR¹CHR²0 Normally the repeat units B will all be of the same specific structure, although the scope of the invention is intended to embrace polymers having repeat units B of more than one specific structure e.g. 2 or 3 different specific structures . The repeating units of structure B may alternatively be formed by the partial esterification or amidification of an already polymerised olefinically unsaturated carboxylic acid or an esterifiable or amidifiable derivative thereof such as an acid chloride or anhydride using, preferably, an alcohol of formula HO CHR¹CHR²0 In one interesting aspect of this alternative method for producing units of structures A and B, an olefinically unsaturated cyclic anhydride may be used to produce both the acid and ester amide groups of the resulting polymer. For example, maleic anhydride may be polymerised to form a polymer of repeat unit and the resulting repeating units A and B after esterification with HO CHR¹CHR²0 It is thus apparent that there are two preferred processes for preparing polymers according to the invention. The first process a comprises polymerising usually by free radical initiation an olefinically unsaturated carboxylic acid or an esterifiable or amidifiable derivative thereof and partially esterifying or amidifying the resulting polyacid or derivative thereof with at least one alcohol of formula HO CHR¹CHR²0 The second and generally more preferred process b comprises copolymerising usually by free radical initiation at least one polymerisable ester or amide, formed from the reaction of a first olefinically unsaturated carboxylic acid or an esterifiable or amidifiable derivative thereof and an alcohol of formula HO CHR¹CHR²0 Both processes will yield repeat units of structure A and structure B as hereinbefore defined. In the polymers of the invention, it is preferable that substantially all the R¹ and R² groups are hydrogen so that CHR¹CHR²0 Preferably R³ is a lower alkyl group containing up to 5 carbon atoms, e.g. n butyl or more preferably me thyl. It may, nevertheless, be hydrogen. Specific examples of polymers that we have prepared and investigated have repeating units structures A and B as follows In the polymers of the invention, n is a number of from 1 to 60 as defined herein. Often, however, n is preferably from 1 to 20. It should be appreciated that most polymers according to the invention particularly those made with precursors providing the alkyleneoxy grouping that have been obtained commercially may have a small spread of alkyleneoxy chain length so that n may represent an average value in such cases. As defined herein, the ratio of C0₂H groups to CHR¹CHR²0 groups is within the range of from 1 20 to 20 1. Preferably the ratio is from 1 5 to 5 1. Typically the polymers of the invention have weight average molecular weights within the range of from 5000 to 500,000, although we do not exclude the possibility that suitable polymers having molecular weights outside this range may be used in the present invention. The groups X and Y may be unsubstituted hydrocarbyl radicals or may be substituted with groups such as hydroxy, alkoxy and halogen chlorine provided the desired properties of the polymers are not adversely affected. Preferably however, the groups X and Y are unsubstituted, i.e. have only groups linked L and M attached to them. The polymers of the invention may also contain up to 50 w w i.e. 0 to 50 w w , sometimes up to 10 w w i,e. 0 to 10 w w , of repeating units other than those of structures A and B, which form the backbone thereof, and these may provide one or more in chain or pendant hetero atoms per unit . Such other repeating units must not of course adversely affect the properties of the resulting oral hygiene compositions. More usually however, the polymers of the invention have substantially all their repeating units with structures A and B. The oral hygiene compositions of the invention generally have said at least one polymer present therein at a concentration of about 0.05 to 30 weight of the composition, the preferred concentration range being from about 0.1 to 5 weight and more preferably 0.2 to 2 weight . While the oral hygiene compositions of the invention will usually have only one polymer according to the invention as defined hereinbefore therein, it is quite feasible to use two or more such polymers in the compositions. Suitable conventional pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles that can be employed in the oral hygiene compositions of the present invention include water, ethanol wherein water, or a water ethanol mixture will often be a major component of the vehicle such humectants as polypropylene glycol, glycerol and sorbitol such geling agents as cellulose derivatives, for example, Methocel RTM , carboxymethylcellulose CMC 7MF and Klucel RTM HF, polyoxypropylene polyoxyethylene block copolymers, for example, Pluronic RTM F 127, Pluronic F 108, Pluronic P 103, Pluronic P 104, Pluronic P 105, and Pluronic P 123, colloidial magnesium aluminosilicate complexes such as Veegum RTM , and mucoprotein thickening agents such as Carbopol RTM 934 gel stabilisers such as the silicon dioxides, for example, Cab 0 Sil RTM M5, and polyvinylpyrrolidone sweeteners such as sodium saccharin preservatives such as citric acid, sodium benzoate, cetylpyridinium chloride, potassium sorbate, methyl and ethyl parabens surfactants such as sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium cocomonoglyceride sulfonate, sodium lauryl sarcosinate and polyoxyethylene isohexadecyl ether Arlasolve RTM 200 and approved colours and flavours. The oral hygiene compositions of the invention may be in the form of any conventional pharmaceutically acceptable oral hygiene formulation that contains and is compatible with an effective amount of a polymer as defined herein. Such formulations include, for example, mouthwashes, rinses, irrigating solutions, abrasive and nonabrasive gel dentifrices, denture cleansers, coated dental floss, coated or impregnated toothbrush bristle natural or synthetic , and interdental stimulator coatings, chewing gums, lozenges, breath fresheners, foams and sprays. The present invention is now illustrated by the following examples. The prefix C for a number denotes a comparative example. Examples 1 to 17 illustrate polymers and their preparation according to the present invention of which polymers oral hygiene compositions according to the invention may be comprised. It was found that comonomers providing units A and B reacted so as to give polymers in which the mole ratio of A to B units therein was close to the mole ratio used for the starting monomers indicating approximately equal reactivities , so that the latter ratio could be used for calculating the former, which was also checked in most cases using ordinary analytical techniques chemical analysis, NMR, and acid base titrations . A typical polymer preparation, specifically applicable to the polymers of Examples 1 to 6, 9, 10, and 12 is now described. Dry chemicals and solvents were used. Methacryloyl chloride 0.11 moles was added slowly with stirring to a slight molar excess of a 30 solution of 2,6 lutidine in toluene. Fuming occurred and a white precipitate formed. The mixture was cooled in an ice bath and methoxy ended polyethylene glycol 0.10 moles was added dropwise over 3 hours with stirring under nitrogen. A copious white precipitate formed and stirring was continued for a further 2 hours. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature. The precipitate was filtered off and washed with small volumes of toluene. The combined filtrates were evaporated to dryness over 90 yield on a rotary evaporator at 45 C. The structure of the product was confirmed, by IR, NMR and vinyl bond titration, as substantially α methoxy ω methacryloyloxy polyethylene glycol. The monomers methacrylic acid and α methoxy ω methacryloyloxy polyethylene glycol, in selected molar ratios total 25 grams , and solvent usually ethanol or ethanol water mixture 300 ml were charged to a reaction vessel at 70 C. Initiator 1.8 x 10 ³ moles in solvent 20 mls was added and the reaction mixture was stirred 200 rpm at 70 C for 24 hours. Further initiator 7 x 10 ⁴ moles in solvent 20 ml was added and the reaction was continued for a further 24 hours. The reaction mixture was evaporated on a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure to leave a copolymer usually about 95 yield . The compositions of the copolymers are given in Table 1, which also gives the values for n and the ratio of CO₂H to CHR¹CHR²0 groups. Substantially the same sort of technique was employed for the preparation of the polymers of Examples 7, 8, 11, 13, 14, 16 and 17 except that The compositions of these polymers are also given in Table 1. The polymer of Example 15 was prepared by the alternative technique of partially esterifying or amidifying an already polymerised carboxy acid or derivative thereof. A maleic anhydride methyl vinyl ether copolymer 1 1 molar of medium molecular weight Aldrich was reacted at an elevated temperature with the calculated amount of C₄H₉ OCH₂CH₂ ₄ 0CH₂CH CH₃ ₂NH₂ available commercially , under anhydrous conditions to provide a partially amidified product each anhydride group reacting with the amine forming adjacent carboxyl and amido groups . This product was then heated with water excess to hydrolyse the residual unreacted anhydride groups to form adjacent carboxyl groups. This yielded, respectively, the repeating units so that the repeat units of structures A and B were respectively The composition of this polymer is also given in Table 1. The polymers of C18 to C21 were prepared for comparative purposes, using substantially the same technique as used for Examples 1 to 6, etc, except that The weight average molecular weights of most of the polymers were determined using gel permeation chromatography with polystyrene or polyethylene oxide standards, and dimethyl formamide or tetrahydrofuran as solvent and were mostly within the range 5000 and 500,000. The product of Example 8 of US 3542917 was also prepared for comparative purposes, being denoted by Example C22. Example C23 denotes an analogous product to that of Example 8 of US 3542917 but using polyethylene glycol in place of polypropylene glycol. These examples illustrate the extent of the reduction in bacterial adhesion obtained with use of the polymers hereinbefore defined. Polished hydroxyapatite discs 25 mm diameter were used as a model tooth surface. The discs were used clean or were pellicle coated by incubating in freshly collected whole saliva from a single donor for 1 hour at 37 C, followed by brushing with water 5 times. The aforementioned discs were held in a 1 w v aqueous or alcoholic solution of the polymers in a petri dish for 5 minutes at ambient temperature and were then washed by shaking 5 times in a container of flowing water treated discs . The treated discs were immersed in the aforementioned suspension for 2 hours. The treated discs were then washed by shaking 5 times in a container of flowing water and bacteria adhering thereto were stained using Loeffler s Methylene Blue 30 ml of 95 ethanol, 0.3 gram methylene blue and 100 ml of water . Microscopic examination was used to estimate the reduction in bacterial adhesion of the clean discs and pellicle coated discs versus untreated control discs. The results for the clean discs are given in Table 2. In the case of pellicle coated discs, the results of extensive testing using selected polymers, viz those of Examples 1, 5, and 6, were 90 , 97 and 87 reduction respectively. Examples 24 and 28 were repeated using extracted human teeth which had been brushed. Similar results were obtained. The polymer of Example 5 was tested for its effectiveness in preventing the adherent deposition of a range of oral bacteria other than A number of polymers according to the invention, identified as being extremely promising by the petri dish experiments described in the preceding examples, were subjected to a more severe challenge using flowing conditions in order to more closely simulate the environment inside a mammalian human mouth. A Drip Machine was developed for this purpose, and consisted of a glass reservoir containing approximately 400 ml of a stirred solution of It can be seen that all the polymer compositions according to the invention used in Examples 55 to 68 gave a positive degree of utility for preventing adherent bacterial deposition under the more severe testing conditions employed in the Drip Machine , and those containing the polymers of Example 5, 7, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, and 17 were particularly noteworthy by giving reductions of 90 or above even under these more severe conditions.
