## Description
SPECIFICATION. TITLETHERMOSETTING COMPOSITION. DESCRIPTION. This invention relates to thermosetting compositions. Thermosetting compositions which cure by reaction of hydroxyl functionality with an amino compound are well known in the art.It is also well recognized in the art that it is desirable to catalyze the hydroxyl amino core slinking reaction in order to attain a quicker and more complete cure of the compositions1 particularly when the composition is to be used as a coating material. To this endt catalysts for this reaction have been developed and are also well known. Exemplary of the numerous known catalysts are p toluene sulfonic acid and various organophosphate esters such as those taught by U.S. Patents 3,960,979 and 4,018,848 to Khanna. In many c mpositions these catalysts also function as reactive catalysts. While these known catalysts and reactive catalysts effictively catalyze the hydroxyl amino reaction, they have several deficiencies.When necessary amounts of prior art catalysts are included in compositions curing via the hydroxyl amino reaction, the compositions often lack shelf stability, resulting in premature crosslinking.Many prior art catalysts have a detrimental effect on pigments, thus resulting in color changes, and some of the known catalysts cause coagulation of the compositions.Still further, some of the known catalysts result in gassing when used in compositions including metallic pigments.

The latent accelerator of Cordier is selected from the group consisting of an organic acid having the formula EMI3.1 esterified with various alcohols including Y CH2 OH wherein X is phenyl or alkyl phenyl, such as CH3 C6H4 o or p tolyl , and Y is alkyl, hydroxy alkyl, alkoxy alkyl or aroxy alkyl column 2, 1. 54 column 3, 1. 25 .

U.S. Patents 2,681,897, 2,853,463, 3,082,184, 3,235,622, 3,269,994, 3,414,635 and 3,865,683 teach compositions comprising hydroxy functional materials and aminoplastic crosslinking agents. Catalysts employed, if any, are conventional types. It has been discovered that thermosetting compositions of the aforementioned type wherein the crosslinking reaction consists essentially of a reaction between hydroxyl functionality and an amine aldehyde compound are significantly improved when a latent reactive catalyst is including in the composition. This latent reactive catalyst is the reaction product of i a compound bearing 2 or more epoxide groups and having a number average molecular weight Mn ranging from about 140 to about lO,OO0 and ii a sulfonic acid having the formulaEMI4.1 wherein R is selected from linear or branched alkyl groups and aryl groups. A first type of preferred compounds bearing 2 or more epoxide groups for use in preparation of the latent reactive catalyst comprises polyepoxide resins having a number average molecular weight of between about 140 and about 3,000. A second preferred type of compound comprises copolymers bearing pendent epoxy functionality, having a number average molecular weight Mn of between about 1,500 and 10,000 and glass transition temperature Tg of between about 250C and about 700C, said copolymer being prepared from between about 5 and about 30 weight percent of monoethylenically unsaturated monomers bearing glycidyl fullctionality and between about 70. and about 95 weight percent of other monoethylenically unsaturated monomers.A third type of preferred compound comprises bifunctional copolymers bearing hydroxyl functionality and pendent epoxy functionality, having a number average molecular weight Mn of between about 1,500 and about 10,000 and a glass transition temperature Tg of between about 250C and about 700 C, said copolymer being prepared from a between about 1 and about 25 weight percent of monoethylenically unsaturated monomers bearing glycidyl functionality, b between about 10 and about 29 weight percent of monoethylenically unsaturated monomers bearing hydroxl functionality, and c between about 65 and about 89 weight percent of other monoethylenically unsaturated monomers. As the compositoin is heated during the curing cycle, the latent reactive catalyst breaks down to form a sulfonic acid catalyst and a polymeric component which may or may not bear epoxy functionality which has not been previously reacted in the preparation of said latent reactive catalyst. At those reaction sites where sulfonic acid moieties become disconnected from the polymer as the composition is heated, ketones, aldehydes, or other organic groups may be formed. This polymeric material is of sufficient molecular weight that it is retained in the composition and becomes a part of the cured material. The solfonic acid catalyst generated from the latent reactive catalyst not only catalyzes the hydroxyl amino reaction, but also may react with other functionality present on the film forming material of the composition, e.g., epoxy functionality, to generate hydroxyl functionality in situ. This hydroxyl functionality is then available to participate in the catalyzed hydroxyl anino crosslinking reaction. The sulfonic acid also may react, of course, with any residual epoxy functionality on the polymeric component generated from the latent reactive catalyst. Any hydroxyl groups formed by such reaction would also be available to participate in the crosslinking reaction of the composition.In many cases the polyepoxide materials used to prepare the latent reactive catalyst will also bear hydroxyl functionality as will the polymeric component generated by decomposition of the latent reactive catalyst. These hydroxyl groups are also available for reaction during cure. More specifically, the catalyzed compositions of the invention include the broad class of thermosetting compositions wherein hydroxyl functionality of the film forming component is crosslinked with conventional amine aldehyde crosslinking agents. The hydroxy functionality of the film forming material is either i initially present on the film forming material prior to reaction during cure of the composition, ii generated in situ on said film forming material during cure of said composition, or iii both initially present, and generated in situ.As will be more fully described hereinafter, the hydroxyl functionality of the film forming material which may be generated in situ may be generated in any manner known to the art with respect to this type of composition or it may be generated by a reaction between the in situ generated catalyst itself and functionality in t re film forming material, in particular, between the in situ generated catalyst and epoxy functionality on the film forming material. In this case, the generated catalyst serves as a reactant which helps generate the hydroxyl functionality subsequently engaged in the crosslinking reaction with the amino compound. As noted above, the generated catalyst may also react with any residual epoxy on the polymeric material generated from decomposition of the latent reactive catalyst. This generated hydroxyl functionality as well as any hydroxyl functionality which may be on the same polymeric material, is available for reaction during the catalyzed hydroxyl amino .curing reaction. In general, the amount of latent reactive catalyst employed will vary between about 0.1 and about 10 weight percent based on the total weight of reactive components, including latent reactive catalyst, in the composition. It will be apprecia1ed by those skilled in the art that this range is not critical to the broad applications of the invent ion. The preferred coating compositions of the invention contain greater than about 55 percent by weight of nonvolatile solids, preferably greater than about 60 percent by weight, and are capable of curing rapidly at low temperature. These compositions, exclusive of pigments, solvents and other nonreactive components, consists essentially of A a film forming resin bearing epoxy functionality, or both epoxy and hydroxyl functionality B the latent reactive catalyst described above C an amine aldehyde crosslinking agent and D up to about 45 weight percent based on the total of A , B , C and D of a hydroxy functional additive. The latent reactive catalyst is included in these preferred compositions in an amount ranging from about 0.5 to about 5 weight percent based on the total weight of A , B , C and D discussed above. The amine adehyde crosslinking agent in these preferred compositions is included in an amount ranging from about 15 to about 45 weight percent based on the total weight of A , B , C and D . Other ingredients of these preferred compositions may include additives such as catalysts, antioxidants, U.V.absorbers, flow control or wetting agents, antistatic agents, pigments, plasticizers, solvents, etc. As di cussed generally above, the compositions of the invention are thermosetting materials i comprising a film forming material bearing hydroxyl functionality, which is either initially present in the composition or which is formed by in situ reaction, ii an amine aldehyde crosslinking agent, and iii a latent reactive catalyst. Because the catalyst is generated in situ during cure, sufficient amounts of the latent reactive catalyst may be included in the composition in order to allow for rapid cure, without causing deleterious effects, including loss of shelf life. Particularly preferred compositions within the scope of the invention are fast curing, high solids, thermosetting coating compositions. More particularly, these preferred compositions are adapted to provide an automotive topcoat which demonstrates hardness, high gloss, outstanding durability and excellent resistance to solvents and water.Still more particularly, the preferred compositions are fast curing, high sol As, thermosetting coating compositions adapted to be used as automotive topcoats including metallic flake as a pigment. Because of increasingly strict solvent emissions regulations in recent years, low solvent emission paints have become very desirable. A number of high solids paint compositions have been proposed to meet these low solvent emission requirements. However, many of these compositions are deficient because of difficulty L application, slow curing rates, lack of flexibility, poor durability and low solvent and water resistance. Many of the proposed compositions have been particularly deficient as automotive topcoats, particularly when the topcoat is to include metallic flake as a pigment. The deficiency in compositions including metallic flake results from excessive gassing as well as undesired reorientation of the metallic flake during application and cure of the coating. Flake reorientation results primarily because of the very low viscosity resins used in the paint compositions to accommodate high solids. The low viscosity is not sufficient to immobilize the flakes which tend to redistribute themselves to show reverse flop and nonuniform distribution. The preferred coating compositions of this invention combine the above discussed desired properties and low api licatiqn viscosity with rapid cure so as to overcome disadvantages of prior art high solids compositions to provide a system which is particularly suitable for those applications requiring high gloss, hardness, durability, and high solvent and water resistance as well as a fast cure rate at low temperature, e.g., between about 750C and about 1500C, preferably between abou tllO C and about. 1300C.The desirable characteristics of these preferred compositions of the invention result from the carefully controlled admixture of the particular components, including the latent reactive catalyst, to achieve substantially complete utilization of reactant functionality and a resultant highly crosslinked coating in a fast and efficient manner. Each of the components of the compositions of the invention, in general, and the high solids coating compositions, in particular, are described hereinafter in greater detail.Latent Reactive Catalyst The latent reactive catalyst of the compositions of the invention comprises the reaction product of i a compound bearing 2 or more epoxide groups and having a number molecular weight Mn of between about 140 and about 10,000 and ii a sulfonic acid having the formula EMI9.1 wherein R is selected from linear or branched alkyl groups and aryl groups. The epoxy bearing compound and the sulfonic acid are reacted in such amounts that there are between about 0.3 and about 1.0 acid groups per epoxy in the reaction mixture. A first preferred type of epoxy bearing compound comprises polyepoxide resin having a number average molecular weight Mn of between about 140 and about 3,000. When polyepoxide resin is employed the polyepoxide and sulfonic acid are preferably reacted in such amounts that there are between about 0.5 and about 1.0, preferably between about 0.75 and about 1.0, acid groups per epoxy in the reaction mixture. The polyepoxide resin employed in the preparation of the latent reactive catalyst of compositions of the invention has at least about 2 epoxide groups thereon per molecule, preferably between about 2 and about 4 epoxide groups per molecule. Useful polyepoxides may be selected from aliphatic, cyclo iphatic and aromatic polyepoxides falling within the aforementioned molecular weight range. Such polyepoxides are well known compositions and any of these may be employea in the preparation of latent reactive catalysts useful in compositions of the invention. Among the many suitable types of polyepoxides are those disclosed by U.S. Patents 3,404,018 2,528,359t 2,528,360 3,198,850 3,960,979 and 4,018,848. U.S. Patent 3,404,018 discloses several particularly suitable types of polyepoxides including 1 polyglycidyl ethers of polyhydric alcohols and polyhydric phenols 2 epoxidized esters of polyethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acids 3 glycidyl esters cf polybasic acids 4 epoxidized esters of unsaturated monohydric alcohols and polycarboxyl acids and 5 epoxidized polymers and copolymers of diolefins. Many polyepoxides other than those recited in this or other referenced patent will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The polyepoxide resins enumerated above, in addition to having at least about 2 epoxide groups per molecule, may also bear hydroxyl functionality. A second preferred type ot epoxy bearing compound used to prepare the latent reactive catalyst comprises a copolymer bearing pendent epoxy functionality, having a number average molecular weight Mn of between about 1,500 and about 10,000 and a glass transition temperature Tg of between about 25 C 0 g and about 70 C, said copolymer being prepared from between about 5 ani about 30 weight percent of monoehtylenically unsaturated monomers bearing glycidyl functionality and between about 70 and 95 weight percent of other monoethylenically unsaturated monomers and the copolymer bearing pendent epoxy functionality and the sulfonic acid are reacted in such amounts that there are between about 0.3 and about 1, preferably between about 0.5 and about 0.9, acid groups per epoxy in the reaction mixture. The epoxy functional copolyner used in the preparat ion of the latent reactive catalyst is prepared by conventlonsl technioues known to those skilled in the art e.g., free radical colyrerlzation. The monoethylenically unsaturated monomers bearing glycidyl functionality may be either gycidyl ethers or glycidyl esters Preferably, however, the epoxy functional monomers are glycidyl esters of nonoethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids. Examples are glycidyl acrylates and glycidyl methacrylates. As noted above, the remainder of tie monomers forming the epoxy functional copolymer, used in the preparation of the latent reactive catalyst, i.e., between about 70 and about 95 weight percent, are other tnonoethylen. cally unsaturated monomers.

When such monovinyl hydrocarbons are employed, they should constitute less than 50 weight percent of the isopolymer. Other monomers such as vinyl chloride acrylonitrile, met ,acrylonitrile, r and vinyl acetate may be included in the copolymer as modifying monomers. however, when employed, these modifying monomers should constitute only between about 0 and about 30 weight percent of the monomers in the copolymer.

The bifunctional copolymer used in the preparation of the latent reactive catalyst is prepared by conentional techniques known to those skilled in the art, e.g., free radical polymerization. The monoethylenically unsaturated monomers bearing glycidyl functionality may be either glycidyl ethers .or glycidyl esters. Preferably, however, the epoxy functional monomers are glycidyl esters of monoethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids. Examples are glycidyl acrylates and glycidyl methacrylates. As noted above, the bifunctional copolymer used to prepare the latent reacti e catalyst bears hydroxyl functionality. Preferably such hydroxy functionality is pendent hydroxyl functionality provided by monoethylenically unsaturated monomers. The long list of hydroxy functionalmonomers which may be employed in preparing these bifunctional copolymers includes, but is not limited to, the following esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid and aliphatic alcohols 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate 3 chloro 2 hydroxypropyl acrylate 2 hydroxy l methylethyl acrylate 2 hydroxypropyl acrylate 3 hyqroxypropyl acrylate 2,3 dihydrozypropyl acrylate 2 hydroxybutyl acrylate 4 hydroxybutyl acrylate diethyl eneglycol acrylate 5 hydroxypentyl acrylate 6 hydroxyhexyl acrylate triethyleneglycol acrylate 7 hydroxyheptyl acrylate 2 hydroxymethyl methacrylate 3 chloro 2 hydroxy propyl methacrylate 2 hydroYy l methylethyl methacrylate 2 hydroxypropyl methacrylate 3 hydroxypropyl ethacry 2,3 dihydroxypropyl methacrylate 2 hydroxybutyl methacry late 4 hydroxybutyl methacrylate 3,4 dihydroxybutyl methacrylate 5 hydroxypentyl methacrylate 6 hydroxyhexyl methacrylate 1,3 dimethyl 3 hydroxybutyl methacrylate 5,6dihydroxyhexyl methacrylate and 7 hydroxyheptyl methacrylate. Although one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that many different hydroxyl bearing monomers including those listed above could be employed, the preferred hydroxy functional monomers for use in the bifunctional copolymers employed in preparing the latent reactive catalyst are C5 C7 hydroxy alkyl acrylates and or C6 C8 hydroxy alkyl methacrylates i.e., esters of C2 C3 dihydric alcohols and acrylic or methacrylic acids. As noted above, the remainder of tbe monomers forming the bifunctional copolymer used in the preparation of the latent reactive catalyst, i.e., between about 65 and about 89 weight percent, are other monoethylenically unsaturated monomers. These monoethylenically unsaturated monomers, are preferably alpha, beta olefinically unsaturated monomers, i.e., monomers bearing olefinic unsaturation between the two carbon toms in the alpha and beta positions with respect to the terminus of an aliphatic carbon to carbon chain. Among the alpha, beta olefinically unsaturated monomers which may be employed lr. such copolymers are acrylates meaning esters of either acrylic or methacrylic acids as well as mixtures of acrylates and vinyl hydrocarbons.

Other monomers such as vinyl chloride, acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, and vinyl acetate may be included in the copolymer as modifying monomers. However, when employed, these modifying monomers should constitute only between about 0 and about 30 weight percent of the monomers in the copolymer. Exemplary of the numerous alkyl groups which may be employed as the R group in the sulfonic acid are methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, isobutyl, pentyl, hexyl, etc. Exemplary of the numerous aryl groups which may be employed as R are phenyl o and p methoxyphenyl, 0 . and pethoxyphenyl and o and p tolyl groups, etc. Ortho and para tolyl groups are preferred. The manner of preparation of tLe latent reactive catalyst used in compositions of the invention will be more fully appreciated after reading the specific examples set forth hereinafter. In the course of the curing of Compositions of the invention, the latent reactive catalyst breaks down to form a sulfonic acid catalyst and a polymeric component. The polymeric component is the residue of the epoxy bearing compound which was reacted with the sulfonic acid to form the latent reactive catalyst. If an excess of epoxide functionality was present in the original reaction mixture used to form the latent reactive catalyst such that epoxide functionality on a given epoxy functional compound remains unreacted, epoxide will be present on the polymeric residue after breakdown of the latent reactive catalyzes . This epoxide remaining on the polymeric residue is then available to react with the acid groups of the generated sulfonic acid catalyst to form hydroxyl groups. These hydroxyl groups will in turn be available to crosslink with the amino crossl inking anent during cure and the polymeric residue, thus, will be chemically bound in the cured product. As noted hereinbefore, at those reaction sites where sulfonic acid moieties become disconnected from the polymer as the composition is heated, ketone, aldehydes or other organic groups but not epoxy or hydroxyl groups will be formed. Excess epoxy functionality on the epoxy functional compound reacted with the sulfonic acid to form the latent reactive catalyst can also have a beneficial effect on maintaining the shelf stability of coating compositions containing the latent reactive catalyst. This is particularly the case when no additional epoxy functionality is present in the composition, e.g., in the film forming material. As discussed hereinbefore, in those compositions wherein acid catalysts are employed there is often a problem with premature crosslinking. The invention described herein is intended to obviate problems associa ed with premature crosslinking by employing a latent catalyst such that the catalyst is not generated until the composition is being cured.Although the latent reactive catalysts of the invention essentially obviate this problem, there may under certain storage and handling conditions result a premature decon,gosition of the latent reactive catalyst to form a sulfonic acid catalyst.Such free catalyst can, of course, result in premature crosslinking by catalyzing the hydroxyl amino reaction. If, however, epoxy functionality is present in the composition, such as from an excess of epoxy on said epoxy functional copolymer as discussed above, the generated acid will react .with that epoxy and, thus, will not prematurely catalyze the crosslinking reaction. The sulfonic acid catalyst generated from the latent reactive catalyst as the compositions of the invention are heated pursuant to curing them, thus, not only catalyzes the hydroxyl amino react ion, but also may react with other functionality present on the film forming material of the composition, e.g., epoxy functionality, to generate hydroxyl functionality in situ. This hydroxyl functionality is then available to participate in the catalyzed hydroxyl amino crosslinking reaction. The sulfonic acid catalyst also may react with any residual epoxy on the polymeric component generated from the latent reactive catalyst. As discussed above, hydroxyl groups thus generated would also be available to participate in the crosslinking reaction.Still further, any hydroxyl functionality on the epoxy bearing compound used to form the latent reactive catalyst and on the resultant polymeric component formed upon breakdown of the latent catalyst, will also be available to react during the crosslinking reaction. In general, compositions of the invention may include between about .1 and about 10 weight percent of latent reactive catalyst based on the total weight of the reactive components in the composition. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, of course, that varying amounts of latent reactive catalyst may be included, depending on the temperature of cure, heat sensitivity of the catalyst, the amount of catalysis desired, the amount of tunctionality, such as epoxy, present in the film forming material which. is reactive with the generated catalyst, etc.The approximate amount of catalyst which will be generated in situ from a given amount of the latent reactive catalyst, of course, may be readily determined. It will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the higher weight percents of latent reactive catalyst within the above range will be particularly useful when the composition includes functionality, e.g., epoxy, which reacts with the generated catalyst for form hydroxyl functionality. The amount of latent reactive catalyst used in the preferred high solids coating compositions of the invention will be discussed hereinafter.Film Formina Material As discussed above, film forming materials which either include hydroxyl functionality initially, generate hydroxyl functionality as a result of in situ reactions during the coating process or both include hydroxyl functionality initially and generate it in situ, are well known to those skilled in the art. Selection of those materials will be a matter of choice and it will be recognized that the use of the latent reactive catalyst described above is equally applicable to all such hydroxyl bearing film forming materials crosslinked with amino compound. While it is intended that all such hydroxyl bearing film forming materials be included within the scope of the invention, several of these materials will be discussed below in greater detail for purposes of exemplification. As discussed above, the film forming material may consist essentially of a compound which bears hydroxyl functionality prior to initiation of the curing reaction. In most coating compositions, such materials should have a number average molecular weight Mn of at least 150. A preferred type of hydroxy functional material which meets these limitations consists essentially of a copolymer bearing pendent hydroxyl functionality.One class of such materials have a number average molecular weight . n of between about 1000 and about 20,000 and a glass transition temperature Tg of between about 250C and about 70 CC. Such a copolymer may, for example, consist of between about 5 and about 30 weight percent of monoethylenically unsaturated monomers bearing hydroxyl functionality and between about 95 and about 70 weight percent of other monoethylenically unsaturated monomers. Suitable .hydroxy functional monomers for use in preparing this film forming copolymer are the same as those discussed hereinbefore as being useful in preparation of the bifunctional copolymer emplyoed in preparation of the bifunctional copolymer. The remainder of the monomers forming the hydroxy functional film forming copolymer, i.e., between about 90 and about 70 weight percent, are other monoethylenically unsaturated monomers. These monoethylenically unsaturated monomers, are preferably alpha, beta olefinically unsaturated monomers, i.e., monomers bearing olefinic unsaturation between the two carbon atoms in the alpha and beta positions with respect to the terminus of an aliphatic carbon to carbon chain. Among the alpha, beta olefinically unsaturated monomers which may be employed in such copolymers are acrylates meaning esters of either acrylic or methacrylic acids as well as mixtures of acrylates and vinyl hydrocarbons. Preferably, in excess of 50 weight percent of the total of the copolymer monomers are esters of C1 C12 monohydric alcohols and acrylic or methacrylic acids, e.g., methylmethacrylate, ethylacrylate, butylacrylate, butylmethacrylate, hexylacrylate, 2 ethylhexylacrylate, laturylmethacry late, etc.Among the monovinyl hydrocarbons suitable for use in forming the copolymers are those containing 8 to 1 2 carbon atoms and including styrene, alpha methylstyrene, vinyl toluene, t butylstyrene and chlorostrene. When such monovinyl hydrocarbons are employed, they should constitute less than 50 weight percent of the copolymer. Other monomers such as vinyl chloride, acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, and vinyl acetate may be included in the copolymer as modifying monomers. However, when employed, these modifying monomers should constitute only between about 0 and about 30 weight percent of the monomers in the copolymer. As mentioned. above, the film forming material may contain both hydroxyl functionality and a material which reacts in situ to form hydroxyl functionality. Exemplary of one such film forming material would be a material which consists essentially of a single copolymer bearing both hydroxyl and epoxy functionality, the epoxy functionality reacting with the acid functionality of the generated sulfonic acid catalyst as discussed above to form hydroxyl functionality which thereafter may also react with the aminealdehyde crosslinking agent. Such a bifunctional copolymer may be of the acrylic type similar to the hydroxy functional copolymer discussed above.A preferred bifunctional copolymer of this type has a number average. molecular weight Mn of between about 1500 and about 6,000, and a glass transition temperature Tg of between about 250C and about 700C, preferably between about lO0C and about 500C. Such a copolymer preferably is formed from between about 5 and 25 weight percent of monoethylenically unsaturated monomers bearing glycidyl functionality and between about 5 and about 25 weight percent of monoethylenically unsaturated monomers bearing hydroxyl functionality, with the total of the monoethylenically unsaturated monomers bearing either said glycidyl functionality or said .hydroxyl functionality being not greater than about 30 weight percent of the monomers in the copolymer. The monoethylenically unsaturated monomers bearing glycidyl functionality may be either glycidyl ethers or glycidyl esters. Preferably, however, the epoxy functional monomers are glycidyl esters of monoethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids. Examples are glycidyl acrylates and glycidyl methacrylates. The remainder of the monomers in the copolymer, i.e., between about 90 and about 70 weight percent, consist of other monoethylenically unsaturated monomers, such as those described above. Also as mentioned above, the film forming material may consist essentially of a compound which reacts in situ to form hydroxyl functionality, i.e., a compound not initially including hydroxyl functionality. Such a compound could be, for example, a copolymer such as those described above, but bearing only glycidyl functionality.Such a copolymer bearing pendent epoxy functionality should have a number average molecular weight Mn of between about 1500 and about 10,000, preferably between about 2,000 and about 6,000, and a glass transition temperature Tg of between out 250C and about 700C, preferably between about 100C and about 50 C. A preferred copolymer of this type consists of between about 10 and about 30 weight percent of monoethylenically unsaturated monomers bearing glycidyl functionality and between about 90 and about 70 weight percent of other monoethylenically unsaturated monomers, as discussed above. Still another compound bearing epoxy functionality which may be employed when solely epoxy functionality, which in turn will react with the acid functionality created by breakdown of the latent reactive catalyst to form hydroxyl functionality, is desired, is a polyepoxide resin having a number average molecular weight of between about 140 and about 3,000, preferably between about 300 and about 2,000. The term polyepoxide resin as used herein means poxide compounds or polymers containing two or more epoxide groups. Such polyepoxide resins are preferably selected from aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic polyepoxides falling within the stated molecular weight range. Such polyepoxides are well known compositions and any of these may be employed. Among the many suitable types of polyepoxides are those disclosed by the U.S.Patents 3,404,018 2,528,539 2,528,360 3,198,850 3,960,979 and 4,018,848. U.S. Patent 3,404,018 discloses several particularly suitable types of polyepoxides including 1 polyglycidyl ethers of polyhydric alcohols and polyhydric phenols 2 epoxidized esters of polyethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acids 3 glycidyl esters of polybasic acids 4 epoxidized esters of unsaturated monohydric alcohols and polycarboxylic acids and 5 epoxidized polymers and copolymers of diolefins. Many polyepoxides other than those recited in this or other referenced patents will be apparent to those skilled in the art. As also mentioned above, there may be those instances when the film forming material desirably comprises separate compounds, one or more bearing hydroxyl functionality and one or more others bearing functionality which reacts in situ to form hydroxyl functionality. Such film forming materials might, for example, consist of the above noted hydroxy functional copolymer combined with the epoxy functional copolymer discussed above or the polyepoxide resin discussed above. Various other combinations of materials, of course, will be apparent to those skilled iq the art. Still other film forming materials are exemplified in the detailed examples set forth hereinafter.Amine Aldehyde Crosslinking Agent Amine aldehyde crosslinking agents suitable for crosslinking hydroxyl bearing materials in accordance with the invention are well known in the art and their selection will be obvious to those skilled in the art. These crosslinking agents, in general, comprise the condensation product of an amino compound with an aldehyde or aldehyde precurser. Exemplary of these types of materials are a urea formaldehyde condensate. Exemplary of other materials within the very broad class of crosslinkin,g agents contemplated are condensation reaction products of formaldehyde with substituted melamine, benzoguanamine and substituted benzoguanamine. Preferred members of the broad class of crosslinking agents are alkylated mel amine and urea formaldehyde resins.Particularly preferred are methylated melamine formaldehyde resins such as hexamethoxymethylmeline. These liquid crosslinking agents have substantially one hundred percent 100 nonvolatile content as measured by the foil.method at 450C for for 45 minutes. Some particularly well known crosslinking agents are amino resins sold by American Cyanamid under the trademark eCymel . In particular, Cymel 301, Cymel 3D3 and Cymel 1156, all alkylated melamine formalçdehyde resins, are useful in compositions falling within the scope of this invention. For further discussion of amine aldehyde crosslinking agents see U.S. Patents 2,222,506 2,226,518 2,227,223 2,227,708 2,322,979 2,327,984 2,323,357 3,326,265 2,350,894 2,681,897 2,853,463 3,082,184 3,235,622 3,269,994 3,414,635 3,865,683 4,083,830 4,083,892 and 41137,389. Of course, the amount of crosslinking agent employed in any given composition is a matter of choice depending upon the final properties desired and the nature of the other materials in the coating composition.Preferred High Solids Coating ComPositions As indicated above, the high solids coating compositions within the scope of the invention include a film forming resin bearing epoxy functionality or both epoxy and hydroxyl functionality. Materials suitable for use in preparing the high solids compositions of the invention are the acrylic copolymers bearing glycidyl functionality or glycidyl and hydroxyl functionality and the polyepoxide resins, all of which are described hereinbefore. In addition to the film forming resin and the latent reactive catalyst the compositions also include an amine aldehyde crosslinking agent generally described above and an optional hydroxy functional additive in an amount up to 45 weight percent of the total of the four major components of the composition. The hydroxy functional additives provide additional hydroxyl functionality so as to provide a more intimate crosslinked structure in the final cured product. These additives are typically selected from various polyols having a number average molecular weight Mn of between about 150 and about 6,000, preferably between about 400 and about 2,600. As.used herein the term polyol means a compound having two or mowe hydroxyl groups. The polyols useful for the preferred high solids compositions of the invention preferably are selected from the group consisting of i hydroxy functional polyesters ii hydroxy functional polyethers iii hydroxy functional oligoesters iv monomeric polyols v hydroxy functional copolymers produced by free radical polymerization of monoethylenically unsaturated monomers, one of which bears hydroxy functionality and which is included in the copolymer in an amount ranging from about 2.5 to about 30 weight percent of the copolymer and vi mixtures of i v . The hydroxy functional polyesters useful in these preferred compositions are preferably fully saturated products prepared from aliphatic dibasic acids containing 2 20 carbon atoms, such as succinic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, azelaic acid, etc., and short chain glycols of up to and including 21 carbon atoms, such as ethylene glycol, 1,2 propylene glycol, 1,3 propylene glycol, 1,2 butylene glycol, 1,3 butylene glycol, 1,4 butylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, 1, 4 cyclohexane dimethylol, 1,6 hexamethylene glycol and 2 ethyl 2 methyl 1,3 propane diol. The molecular weight of these materials ranges from about 200 to about 2,500 and the hydroxyl number ranges from about 30 to about 230.The hydroxyl number is defined as the number of milligrams of potassium hydroxide needed for each gram of sample to neutralize the acetic acid generated during the reaction between the polyol and the excess acetic anhydride. The polyester polyols utilized in the compositions are low melting, soft waxy solids which are easily maintained in the molten state. Among preferred polyesters are products derived from the esterification of ethylene glycol and 1,4 butane diol with adipic acid, ethylene glycol and 1,2 oropylene glycol with adipic acid, azelaic acid and sebacic a id copolyester diols, and mixtures thereof. Among useful polyether diols are polytetramethylene ether glycol, polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol and the like. The hydroxy functional oligoesters useful as hydroxy functional additives in the preferred compositions of the invention are oligoesters preferably having a molecular weight of between about 150 and about 3,000. Such oligoesters may be selected from the group consisting of i oligoesters prepared by reacting a dicarboxylic acid with a monoepoxide such as an alkylene oxide ii oligoesters prepared by reacting 2 polyepoxide with a monocarboxylic acid and iii oligoesters prepared by reacting a hydroxy functional monocarboxylic acid with either a mono or polyepoxide. The oligoester prepared by reacting a dicarboxylic acid with an alkylene oxide is a low molecular weight adduct which has a narrow molecular weight distribution when compared to similar compositions made by normal polyester manufacturing techniques. The adduct is prepared by reacting a dibasic carboxylic acid with alkylene oxides, preferably ethylene oxide Qr propylene oxide, in the presence of a catalyst.Preferred dicarboxylic acids are C6 C12 aliphatic acids such as adipic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid or dodecane dicarboxylic acid. Mixtures of these acids or mixtures of the aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with aromatic dicarboxylic acids also yield suitable hydroxy functional oligoesters. The preparation of oligoesters from monocarboxylic acids and polyepoxides is well known and is described, for example, in U.S. Patents 2,456,408 and 2,653,141. Numerous hydroxy functional oligoesters within this general category will be apparent to those skilled in the art. A third type of hydroxy functional oligoester, i.e., those prepared by reaction of a hydroxy functional, monocarboxylic acid with an epoxide is described in U.S.Patent 3,404,018. While the epoxides employed in accordance with the teachings of that patent are polyepoxides, oligoesters may be prepared in a similar manner to that described therein by employing a monoepoxide, such as an alkylene oxide, and a hydroxy functional monocarboxylic acid as described therein. Numerous monoepoxide materials suitable for this purpose will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Among the numerous monomeric polyols which may be employed as the hydroxy functional additive are the various short chain glycols of up to and including 21 carbon atoms which are useful in preparing tbe hydroxy functional polyesters discussed above. Other conventional polyhydric alcohols such as glycerols and sugar alcohols are also among the numerous monomer polyols which will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The hydroxyl bearing copolymer described above for use as a film forming material for compositions of the invention, in general may also be used as a hydroxy functional additive in the preferred high solids coating compositions of the invention. It is the reactive nature of the catalyst generated during cure which allows the compos it ion to cure rapidly at a low temperature. As indicated generally above, the acid functionality of the catalyst reacts with the epoxy functionality of the epoxy functional film former to form an ester and a hydroxyl group.This hydroxyl group, any hydroxyl groups in the film former in addition to the epoxy functionality, any optional hydroxyl groups included in the composition in the form of hydroxy functional additive, any hydroxyl functionality generated as a result of reaction of acid of the sulfonic acid catalyst with epoxy remaining on the polymeric residue of the epoxy bearing compound used to prepare the latent reactive catalyst, and any hydroxy functionality that may be present on that same polymeric residue crosslinks with the amine aldehyde crosslinking agent.It is critical to achieving the desired results of the high solids coating compositions of this invention, i.e., in making them suitable for use as automotive topcoats, fjhat the amount of generated catalyst be sufficient to convert substantially all of the epoxy functionality in the composition to the desired hydroxy functionality by esterification reaction. To this ed, the latent reactive catalyst is included in the composition 1n an amount ranging from about 1 to about 5 weight percent based on the total weight of the film former, crosslinking agent, optional hydroxy functional component and the latent reactive catalyst itself. The amount of acid functionality from the generated catalyst need not be in stoichiometric amounts to the epoxy functionality. This is because of the fac that during curing of the high solids coating composition, residual water present in the composition hydrolyses some of the esterified product back to acid and this hydrolyzed product then, in turn, reacts with additional epoxy functionality. Of course, the amount of latent reactive catalyst which should be included in the composition in order to convert substantially all epoxy to hydroxyl and still maintain a sufficient level of catalyst to effectively catalyze the hydroxyl amino crosslinking reaction, will vary within the above range. As also indicated above, the amine aldehyde materials function as a crosslinking agent by reacting with hydroxyl functionality present in the composition. In the preferred high solids compositions of the invention this hydroxyl functionality may be present as i an organic hydroxyl group on the polymeric residue resulting from generation of the catalyst ii a hydroxyl group on the .ilm former in those cases where that component bears hydroxy as. well as epoxy functionality iii as a hydroxyl group on the optional hydroxy functional additive or iv as a result of ester if icat ion of epoxy functionality of the film former or excess epoxy functionality on the polymeric residue. In order to achieve the outstanding properties which make these preferred high solids coating compositions particularly useful as automotive topcoaX materials, it is essential that the amount of amine aldehyde crosslinking agent be sufficient to substantially completely crosslink the hydroxyl functionality in the coating composition. Therefore, the amine aldehyde resin crossling agent should be included in the composition in an amount ranging from about 15 to about 45 weight percent based on the total weight of the four above discussed major components.Other Materials Of course, it should be recognized that compositions within the scope of this invention, including the preferred high solids coating compositions, ray include other conventional components. These include, but are not limited to, antioxidants, U.V. absorbers, solvents, surface modifiers, wetting agents, pigments, fillers, etc. The invention will be further understood by referring to the following detailed examples. It should be understood that the specific examples are presented by way of illustration and not by way of limitation.

The reaction mixture is refluxed for half an hour more and then a 10 ml acetone solution of two grams of the above initiator is added dropwise and the reaction mixture is refluxed for half an hour. Part of the solvent is distilled out to bring the solids content to 66 . Fourteen 14 parts of this polymer solution, three parts of Cymel 301, 4.2 parts of hydroxy sulfonate and seven parts of n butyl acetate are added to the formulation described in Example 38 The resulting formulation is applied by spraying to primed steel panels which are baked at 140 CC for 20 minutes to obtain coatings with excellent hardness, adhesion and solvent xylene and methyl ketone resistance.
