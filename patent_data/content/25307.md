## Description
This invention relates to apparatus for use in erecting, and a method of erecting, arch sections to support and line an underground roadway. It is particularly concerned with an underground roadway support and lining as is disclosed and claimed in my copending Patent Application No.of even date claiming priority from United KingdomPatent Application No. 79 29943 dated 29th August 1979 . In ssid afcresaid United Kingdom Patent Application there is disclosed an underground roadway support constituted by a series of arch sections bolted or otherwise tied together with each arch section being constituted by a pair of prefabricated panel sections and at least one but usually two or three prefabricateo arch panels bolted or otherwise tied together. The panels base and arch are formed of steel or concretes. An object of the present invention is to provide apparatus for and a method of erecting such arch sections simply and with constant protection for miners working in the roadway including those erecting the arch sections. According to the present invention there is provided apparatus for use in erecting arch sections to support and line an underground roadway, the apparatus comprising a carriage movable along the roadway, an arch support frame carried by the carriage and adapted to support at least one prefabricated arch panel, and means associated with the arch support frame for elevating an arch panel into alignment with a previously erected arch panel. Preferably, the carriage supports a plurality of arch support frames which provide a magazine facility, only the leading arch support frame having arch panel elevating means associated with it. Preferably, the elevating means is a pusher member slidably supported at the centre of the arch support frame. Preferably, the pusher member is movable by a pivotal arm secured to the arch support frame and operated by a handle to which it is connected. Preferably the pusher member is hydraulically operated. Also according to the present invention there is provided a method of supporting and lining an underground roadway comprising the steps of providing prefabricated base panels and arch panels to define an arch section, and tying the arch section to a previously erected arch section. Preferably, the method comprises the steps of conveying at least one prefabricated arch panel to a desired location, elevating it into alignment with a previously erected arch panel and tying them together, disposing a prefabricated base panel under the lower end of the arch panel, and tying the base panel and arch panel together. An embodiment of the present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a perspective view of arch sections formed by the present invention Fig. 2 is a half end view of apparatus for assembling the arch sections in position Fig. 3 is a view in the direction of arrow A in Fig. 2 Fig. 4 is a perspective view of a roadway showing the apparatus of Figs. 2 and 3 in use Fig. 5 is a perspective view of a roadway showing a variation of the apparatus in use and Fig. 6 is a perspective view of a roadway support and lining being constructed. Referring to Fig. 1, there is shown two examples of arch sections used in the production of an underground roadway support and lining. Each arch section 10 consists of prefabricated base and arch panels, whether of steel or concrete, assembled together by, for example, bolting. Adjacent arch sections 10 can be butty and, for example, bolted together to provide a continuous support and lining for a mine roadway. Each arch section is constituted by two base panels 11 and two long arch panels 12. ihergfnay, alternatively, be three arch panels 12A, or four arch panels for example. Two or three arch panels are preferred. The length of the arch panels in the direction of curvature is selected to suit requirements. It can be seen that packing as indicated at 13 can be effected between the arch sections 10 and the earth strata 14. Reference is made to Figs. 2 to 4. In Fig. 4, there is shown a roadway supported and lined by arch sections 10 incorporating two arch panels 12 as illustrated in Fig. 1. As the roadway is advanced it is also necessary to advance the support and lining to ensure that the miners are always under a protective shield, and apparatus is provided for effecting erection of the forward arch sections. As the roadway support and lining advances there is laid a guide rail 15 along the base panels 11 at each side. These guide rails 15 may be permanent or detachable for use in forward locations of the roadway as the support and lining advance. The apparatus for use in erecting the arcisections is a shuttle comprising at each side an elongate roller carriage 16 to each of which is connected an arcuate frame 17. The two frames 17 define an arch frame and at their junction slidably mount a pusher member 18.This pusher member 18 is engaged by an arm 19 of an erector handle 20 pivoted on one of the frames 17 and normally lying within the frame 17. In use, when the roadway is sufficiently cleared for erection of another arch section, the miners locate on the arch frame 17 two arch panels 12 and they push the shuttle to a position where the arch frame 17 lies forwardly of the erected roadway cover and lining.They pull the handle 20 inwardly which causes the arm 19 to pivot upwardly and so cause the pusher member 18 to move upwardly and move the arch panels 12 into line with the immediately previously erected arch panels 12. The miners then butt the supported arch panels 12 against the erected arch panels 12 and bolt them together. The shuttle is now withdrawn and a base panel 11 inserted underneath and into butting relationship with each arch panel 1 2. The base and arch panels 11 and 12 are then bolted together. Finally, adjacent base panels 11 are bolted together. It will be manifest from the above that the miners are always underneath a protective structure even when erecting the new arch section. It is considered that a second pusher member could be suitably linked to the handle 20 to act on the arch panel so that it is aligned over its entire arcuae length with the previously erected arch panel. The arch panels 12 may be bclted together before being elevated and will be bolted together if thee arch panels are employed. It will be manifest that instead of the simple mechanical arrangement shown, the pusher member could be a pair of hydraulic rams operated remotely from a hydraulic power pack by a miner. It is also envisaged that the shuttle may be powered hydraulically along the track. A magazine may be built into the shuttle seeFig. 5 by providing the carriage 16 along its length with arch frames 17 to receive and hold arch panels 12, only the forward arch frame 17 incorporating the arch panel elevating means. In this instance the pusher member is preferably a hydraulic ram arrangement 21 operated from a hydraulic pump 22 suitably coupled to a hydraulic power pack. I is possible when mining by the drill and fire method to advance a shuttle which also incorporates a magazine to cover the rubble see Fig. 4 and permit same to be cleared safely by the miners before withdrawing same to secure the forward arch section in position to the leading end of the established support and lining arch construction, Reference is now made to Fig. 6 which shows a roadway with the arch construction broken away and with a shuttle incorporating a magazine generally indicated at 23. The prefabricated panels 11 and 12 are located above ground level onto trolleys 24. The latter arrive at the arch construction site by hoist and railway. The panels are transferred from the trolleys 24 to the magazine and shuttle unit 23 by a crawler base machine 25. The crawler base machine 25 is situated at the roadside and fitted to one side are two adjustable stabilizer arms 26. Normally the arms 26 will be retracted and lie over the crawler track and when in use, they are at right angles to the machine body as shown. with The machine 25 is fitted an extensible boom arm 27 at the end of which is a powered clamp 28 which positively locates and locks onto each arch panel 12. The clamp 28 is capable of 3600 rotation. A power pack 29 for the crawler base machine 25 also supplies hydraulic power to the magazine and shuttle unit 23 via flexible hoses not shown . The magazine and shuttle 23 instead of being mounted on guide rails may be mounted on a crawler base.Wlthin the magazine are powered facilities such as rems not shown to move the panels forward until thoy fill rest on the erector arch frame. This erector arch frame may comprise a ram operated caliper movement frame which when actuated, moves the complete arch frame outwards until it comes into contac with the ground strata. Within the caliper frame is provision to bring the panels together in union abutment, after which they are secured together. It is b be noted that the base panels 11 may be either post loaded and fitted with load bearing arrangements or lowered onto the floor position and possibly backfilled, The invention therefore also encompasses a mechanical handling system for use in a roadway support and lining erection and comprising a trolley for conveying the prefabficated panels from above ground to the roadway site, a panel storage magazine and shuttle unit from which assembled arch panels are elevated into position against the strata to be supported, and a panel transfer machine having a pivotal boom with a panel clamp at one end for disposition between the trolley and magazine and shuttle unit. It should be noted that the arch support panel may be of a sufficient length to accommodate more than one pair of arch panels. It should also be noted that the rails, instead of being mounted along the base panels may be disposed on the ground.
