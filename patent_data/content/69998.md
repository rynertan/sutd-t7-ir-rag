# Valve pin and method of manufacture.

## Abstract
This invention relates to an improved valve pin for an injection molding system and a method of making the same. The elongated valve pin 10 has a tip end portion 36 which extends from a larger driven end portion 48 into the flow of melt to the cavity. The elongated tip end portion is provided with a desired combination of strength and thermal conductiv ity by having a copper core 60 inside a steel casing 58 . The casing 58 is made by brazing a tip end cap member 64 to a hollow sleeve 62 . A predetermined quantity of cooper wire 68 is then inserted into the casing and melted in a vacuum furnace to form an integral construction. The excess sleeve 62 is then cut off and the end 76 is brazed into a well 74 in the driven end portion 48 of the valve pin. The tip end cap member 64 is then machined to provide a tip end of a desired shape.
