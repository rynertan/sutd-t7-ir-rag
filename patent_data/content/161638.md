## Description
This invention relates to an optical method for the assay of human immunoglobulins by using monoclonal antibodies thereto either alone or in mixtures of two or more antibodies. Immunoglobulins are proteins produced in lymphoid cells particularly plasma cells and play an important role as antibodies in protecting living bodies from bacteria, viruses, and toxins. The assay of immunoglobulin content of body fluids is an important means for the diagnosis, prophylaxis, and prognosis of various diseases. In recent years, remarkable progress has been made in the method of assay for the immunoglobulin in body fluids recently developed assay methods include SRID, laser nephelometry, turbidimetry, RIA, EIA, and latex agglutination. Especially, a method of rapid assay for immunoglobulin by means of a laser nephelometer as an autoanalyzer for the biochemical assay of multiple items has been lately developed and becoming now in wide use. However, the antibody used in the above methods is generally a polyclonal one and, as a consequence, the degree of agglutination caused by the antigen antibody reaction is so high that it is necessary to dilute the sample serum before being assayed. Such dilution makes the assay procedure complicated and tends to introduce an error into the results of assay. Furthermore, the assay by an automatic analyzer is performed, as a rule, on an undiluted sample. As a consequence, hitherto it has been practically impossible to assay the immunoglobulin content simultaneously with biochemical examination of sugars, lipids, enzymes, and the like on the same sample. Of the immunoglobulins in the serum, IgG is present in an extremely high concentration, the ordinary content being 500 to 3,000 mg dl. Accordingly, in an optical method of assay such as turbidimetry or nephelometry using polyclonal antibodies derived from an immunized animal, if the sample is an undiluted serum, a large amount of the antibodies becomes necessary, resulting in an extremely high turbidity which makes the optical measurement impossible. Therefore, previously it was generally believed impossible to carry out the measurement on an undiluted sample. It was necessary for the optical measurement to carry out the antigen antibody reaction in a serum sample of 10 to 30 fold dilution or, in some cases, even 100 to 300 fold dilution e.g. nephelometry . On the other hand, as examples of the methods of clinical chemical analysis using monoclonal antibodies in the antigen antibody reaction, there may be mentioned radioimmunoassay RIA , enzyme immunoassay EIA , and fluoroimmunoassay FIA . In these methods, the antigen or antibody being assayed is labeled with an isotope, enzyme, or fluoroscent substance and after completion of the antigen antibody reaction the amount of antigen or antibody is indirectly determined through the measurement of the substance used in the labeling, the monoclonal antibody being used in order to improve the precision of assay. However, no example of the effective use of monoclonal antibodies is found in the case of direct optical measurement of the degree of agglutination resulting from the antigen antibody reaction. A reason for this seems to be as described below. In the case wherein the antigen is an immunoglobulin such as IgG having only two antigenic determinants per molecule, the IgG molecule can combine with a monoclonal antibody molecule only at two sites and the resulting complex sill not sufficiently grow in particle size to increase the turbidity, contrary to the case of polyclonal antibodies originated from an animal, wherein many antibody molecules, not predeterminable in number, combine with one IgG molecule to increase the particle size of antigen antibody complex, resulting in an increase in turbidity. Therefore, it has been generally believed that with monoclonal antibodies it is impossible to increase the particle size of antigen antibody complex and, hence, the turbidity per unit weight of the antibody to a sufficiently high level suitable for the optical measurement. As is well known to the art, there is a report on the method of assay for immunoglobulin by use of monoclonal antibodies in Clinical Chemistry, Vol. 27, pp. 2044 2047 1981 . The report may be summarized as follows Although there is observed no turbidity due to the antigen antibody reaction when a single monoclonal antibody is used, yet a turbidity sufficient for the measurement is obtained by use of combinations of two or more monoclonal antibodies. Therefore, when used alone, the monoclonal antibodies reported in the above literature produce, upon reaction with antigens, no or scarcely perceptible turbidity. To produce a turbidity comparable to that produced by polyclonal antibodies, it is necessary to use a number of monoclonal antibodies such a combination can replace polyclonal antibodies. In this case, of course the sample should be diluted similarly to the case wherein the conventional polyclonal antibodies are used. The present invention provides a method for the assay of immunoglobulin, which comprises using monoclonal antibodies to human immunoglobulin, which, when used singly or in mixtures, are capable of producing turbidity upon reacting with an antigen, said monoclonal antibodies being produced by a hybridoma formed by the fusion between cells from mouse myeloma cell line and spleen cells derived from the mouse immunized with human immunoglobulin allowing said monoclonal antibodies and an undiluted sample of body fluids to undergo the antigen antibody reaction exposing the resulting antigen antibody complex to light and optically measuring the degree of agglutination caused by the antigen antibody reaction. This invention makes it possible to assay immunoglobulins in body fluids on a biological sample such as serum, as such without sample dilution, by optically measuring the degree of agglutination caused by the antigen antibody reaction. As a consequence, precision of the assay is improved by eliminating the complication of procedure and the error associated with dilution of samples. It is also made possible to incorporate the assay of immunoglobulins into multi item measurements on a single sample, carried out by an automatic analyzer. Therefore, this invention is expected to contribute much to the art. The present inventors made an extensive study to find an optical method of assaying or determining quantitatively human immunoglobulin in an undiluted sample. As a result, it was found that monoclonal antibodies to human immunoglobulin, when used singly that is, not a combination of a number of monoclonal antibodies , produce turbidity upon reaction with an antigen and found that by using said monoclonal antibodies, it is possible to assay optically the human immunoglobulin content of an undiluted sample of body fluids such as serum the sensitivity i.e. the degree of turbidity can be suitably adjusted by using said monoclonal antibodies each alone or in mixtures of two or more of them. The present invention is predicated upon the above discovery. The assay using the monoclonal antibodies of this invention is carried out in the concentration range somewhat lower than that when polyclonal antibodies are used. In fact, however, it was found that the concentration range is favorable for the assay of immunoglobulin in an undiluted sample of body fluids such as serum, the turbidity sensitivity being sufficient for the optical measurement. The assay on an undiluted sample results in an improvement of the precision because of the elimination of complicated procedure and the error of measurement associated with dilution. Moreover, it makes possible to include the immunoglobulin assay into multi item biochemical examination for sugars, lipids, enzymes, and so on, carried out on a single sample by means of an automatic analyzer, resulting in an extension of the field of application of the present method. The first stage is the formation of monoclonal hybridoma excreting the antibodies, which comprises essentially the following three steps The antigens used in the immunization are purified immunoglobulins separated from the human serum. Each immunoglobulin is dissolved in physiological saline or buffer and injected to mouse or rat preferably at a dose of 1 to 300 µg. The immunization is performed several times at predetermined intervals. The primary immunization is generally performed together with an adjuvant such as Freund s adjuvant or alum. The administration is repeated at intervals of 2 to 4 weeks. The final immunization is performed by administrating intraperitoneally or intravenously a solution of an immunoglobulin in physiological saline without using an adjuvant. The animal being immunized is usually rat or mouse, the selection of strain being dependent upon the established tumor cell strain used in the cell fusion. Of the mouse strains, the most frequently used is BALB C which is related to an established tumor cell strain producing no immunoglobulin. Two to four days after the final immunization, the lymph node or the spleen is excised from the animal body and the lymphocyte obtained therefrom is used in the cell fusion. The tumor cell strain used in the cell fusion is P3 X63 8AZ 1 or P3 NS1 1 which derived from P3 X63 mouse myeloma cell line producing no immunoglobulin. In the cell fusion, the lymphocyte is used in an amount of 5 to 20 times the tumor cells. After washing with MEM medium, McCoy medium, RPMI 1640 medium, or an isotonic buffer, the lymphocyte and the tumor cell are centrifugally treated to the pellet form. The loosened pellets are subjected to cell fusion in the presence of Sendai virus HVJ or polyethylene glycol PEG . It is convenient for handling to use 0.5 to 2 ml of a 40 to 60 solution of PEG having an average molecular weight of 1,000 to 8,000. A small amount of dimethyl sulfoxide is sometimes added together with PEG to accelerate the fusion but it is not essential. After the addition of PEG, the cell fusion is allowed to proceed for 1 to 10 minutes. To the reaction mixture is then added slowly 10 to 50 ml of MEM or RPMI 1640 medium to terminate the reaction. Immediately after termination of the cell fusion, the mixture is centrifuged to remove the supernatant. The fused cells are suspended in MEM or RPMI 1640 medium containing 5 to 20 of fetal calf serum FCS . The suspension is fed to a 24 well culture plate in an amount of 1 ml per well so that 1x10⁵ to 5x10⁶ lymphocytes may be present in each well. It is desirable to add feeder cells such as thymus cells or spleen cells of rat or mouse of the same line, the concentration of the feeder cells in the medium being 0.5 2 The assay of immunoglobulins by use of the monoclonal antibodies according to this invention is suitably performed by turbidimetry, nephelometry, or the like. The turbidimetric assay by use of the present monoclonal antibodies can be carried out by means of a known automatic analyzer or a spectrophotometer, the preferred range of wave length being from 340 to 800 nm, though not limitative. In the nephelometric assay a nephelometer with laser as a light source can be used but the invention is not limited to any particular light source or the method of detection. The buffers used in the assay include those which are generally used, such as Tris buffer, phosphate buffer, and veronal buffer. The pH is preferably in the range of 6.0 to 9.0, though not limitative. The type and number of monoclonal antibodies used in the assay are not limited. Depending upon the required sensitivity, the monoclonal antibodies can be used each alone or in mixtures of two or more of them. The amount used of the monoclonal antibody is not limited but generally 0.02 to 2 g of a monoclonal antibody is present in 1 ml of the antibody solution. The immunoglobulins which can be assayed by the method of this invention include human immunoglobulin classes IgG, IgA, and IgM.
