# Dye diffusion transfer process.

## Abstract
A dye diffusion transfer process for producing a dye image s with improved dye density is provided, said process comprising the steps of 1 image wise photo exposing a photographic colour material, which contains at least one alkali perme able silver halide hydrophilic colloid layer which contains in operative contact therewith or therein a non diffusing dye or dye precursor compound that when contacted with an aqueous alkaline liquid remains immobile in an alkali permeable colloid layer and is capable of being reduced by a silver halide developing agent at a rate slower than that of image wise developable silver halide and in re duced state under alkaline conditions is capable of releasing a diffusible dye or dye precursor moiety, and 2 applying in the presence of a developing agent an aqueous alkaline liquid to said photoexposed ma terial, characterized in that said liquid contains tri isopropanolamine.
