# Latently curable organosilicone compositions.

## Abstract
A latently curable organosilicone composition is stabilizbed against premature gelation by the presence of an amount of an unsaturated amide that is sufficient to inhibit gelation of the composition at low, ambient or room temperature but insufficient to prevent hydro silation at an elevated temperature.
