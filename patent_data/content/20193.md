# Apparatus for controlling the actuation of at least one electromagnetic fuel injector.

## Abstract
The apparatus comprises a differential driver amplifier A2 having a first input receiving the control signal through a voltage divider R1, R2, R3, R7, R8 and a second input receiving a regulation signal and having its output connected to the control terminal of a driver transistor T2 having its power terminals connected in series with a voltage supply, the injector coil L4 and a current sensing device R11 developing the regulation signal, said driver amplifier A2 providing a command signal to the control terminal of the driver transistor T2 causing it to conduct to saturation until a peak current level through the coil L4 is obtained and a comparator A4 having a first input terminal receiving the regulation signal and a second input terminal having applied thereto a reference signal having a first value representative of the peak current level and having its output terminal connected to said voltage divider R1, R2, R3, R7, R8 , said comparator A4 switching the reference signal to a second value representative of a holding current level by modifying said voltage divider R1, R2, R3, R7, R8 in response to the regulation signal exceeding the first value of the reference signal, and said differential driver amplifier A2 then providing a command signal to the control terminal of the driver transistor T2 causing it to reduce the current flow through the coil L4 to the holding current level until the end of the control signal once the peak current level is reached.
