# Proportional ribbon tracking for impact printers.

## Abstract
A method of and apparatus for proportional ribbon 23 tracking on a printer including a printwheel 25 , ribbon 23 and hammer all mounted on a carrier for translation opposite a platen 21 . Ribbon lift mechanism 17, 47 is provided for effecting elevation of ribbon 23 to multiple predetermined positions or tracks so that characters may be printed on print receiving medium 22 . Input means 11 receives a character to be printed. The microprocessor 13 , in conjunction with the ROM 15 , characterizes the character in accordance with a predetermined plurality of characteristics. In accordance with ribbon lift and fed algorithms, a particular characteristic of the character to be printed is added to a position on the ribbon upon which at least one prior character has been printed. In this manner a new print position is determined. Thereafter, the new track print position is outputted to the ribbon lift and feed means 17, 47, 18 for effecting elevation of said ribbon 23 to one of a multiple of predetermined positions to thereby approximately maximize the number of predetermined positions of said ribbon with characters thereon which may be printed without character overlap.
