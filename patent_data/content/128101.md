# Method and apparatus for switching yarn in turret type winder.

## Abstract
A method for automatically switching a yarn from a pack age B1 to an empty bobbin B2 when doffing the package, in which a bobbin holder 18 carrying the package is prelimi nary accelerated by an acceleration disc 31 for maintaining a yarn tension in a proper range before yarn switching with a preset urging force of the acceleration disc onto the bobbin holder increased continuously or stepwisely corresponding to a size of the package. An apparatus for carrying out the above method com prises a pressure control means for a fluid operating a rotary actuator 28 utilized for urging the acceleration disc 3 onto the bobbin holder, which means includes a cam displaceable with a growth of the package B1 and a regulator valve actu ated by the cam for outputting a regulated pressure to the rotary actuator 28 . Use of the method and the apparatus in a turret type automatic winder.
