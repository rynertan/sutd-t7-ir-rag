# TEMPERATURE STABLE DRILLING FLUIDS

## Abstract
Water soluble or water dispersible graft copolymers of lignite or humic acid with a vinyl monomer, e.g. acrylic acid, are useful as fluid loss control additives for aqueous oil drilling muds. The copolymers contain at least 20 by weight, preferably 50 80 by weight of lignite or humic acid, based on the dry weight of the product.
