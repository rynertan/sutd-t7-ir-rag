## Description
Optical fibres having a large numerical aperture. The invention relates to optical fibres having a large numeri cal aperture and consisting of multicomponent glasses. The optical fibres may be of the so called multimode stepped index type or of the graded index type. Optical fibres having a large numerical aperture,i.e. approximately 0.30 or larger, usually comprise at least in the core glass germanium dioxide which is a comparatively expensive component, and in addition such a fibre is sensitive to energy rich radiation due to the comparatively high germanium content. This result in an increase of the attenuation of the transported light, which increase only partly disappears after termination of the irradiation. It is an object of the invention to provide optical fibres of large numerical aperture from multicomponent glasses which do not comprise germanium dioxide and in which at least the core glass comprises no boron oxide. This requires a good adaptation of melting temperature and viscosity at the processing temperature of the irulti component glasses used. In addition it is necessary for the glasses used to have a small tendency to crystallization or phase separation.Another object of the invention is to provide glass compositions which satisfy said requirements. According to the invention, these objects can be achieved by means of optical fibres the core glass of which has the molecular composition 57.5 65 SiO2, 0 58 Zr02 Y2O3 , 10 25 Li20 N0 K20 , 12.5 27.58 O CaO ZnO SrO BaO on the understanding that MgO 0 5 , CaO 0 10i, SrO 0 7.5 , BaO 0 15 , ZnO 0 20 , in which, if no BaO is present, the ZnO content is 12.5 20 and, if no ZnO is present, the BaO content is 5 15 and the cladding glass consists of a silicate glass or a borosilicate glass having a refractive index which is at least 2 layer than the refractive index of the core glass and the viscosity of which at the processing temperature is 0.5 to 2 times the viscosity of the core glass expressed in Pa.s. It has been found that in the case in which the cladding glass satisfies the imposed requirements, stepped index fibres and graded index fibres having a numerical aperture exceeding 0.30 can be obtained by means of, for example, the known double crucible method In the range of conpositions indicated for the core glass, the glasses have a melting temperature between 1250 and 1400 C, a refractive index between 1.550 and 1.595, and a viscosity at 11000C between 30 and 100 Pa.s. Preferably, if K20 is present, the content thereof is less than half of the total alkali metal oxide content of the core glass.The tendency to possible crystallization or phase separation upon slow cooling of the coreglass is suppressed by said measure. The same applies to cladding glass A described hereinafter. Examples of suitable cladding glasses are glasses of the following molecular conposition. A. SiO2 60 67.5 ZnO CaO MgO 10 25 , in which CaO 0 5 , MtO 0 10 and ZnO 0 10 , Li20 Na20 K2O 10 25 B. SiO2 5567.5 , A1203 0 7.5 , ZnO CaO MtO 10 15 , in which CaO 0 7.5 , MtO 0 15 and ZnO 0 10 , B203 5 15 , Li20 Na2O K20 10 25 . Within the composition range A, glasses have a melting tem perature between 1300 and 1400 C a refractive index between 1.535 and 1.540 and a viscosity at 11000C between 70 and 200 Pa.s. Within the composition range B, glasses have a melting temperature between 1200 and 14000C, a refractive index between 1.503 and1.52Q and a viscosity at 1100 C between 15 and 250 Pa.s. Cladding glasses of the conposition A have the advantage of having only a small absorption at wavelengths exceeding 1.3 um, this in contrast with cladding glasses of composition B which absorb above 1.3 um as a result of the presence of boron.However, the latter glasses have a lower melting temperature, a lower viscosity and as a result of this a better tensile strength of the fibre and generally a lower refractive index than cladding glasses of composition A, so that a lower refractive index of the core glass can be permitted to achieve the same numerical aperture. The following may be noted with respect to the multicomponent glasses which may be used according to the invention in multimode stepped index and graded index fibres of large numeral aperture. With SiO2 contents less than 57.5 mol. for the core alass, less than 60 rrol. for the cladding glass A and less than 55 rrol. for the cladding glass B, the tendency of crystallization and phase separation, which cause the Rayleigh scattering to increase, of these glasses rapidly increases. With SiO2 contents rrore than 65 moL for the core glass and trore than 67.5 rrol. for the cladding glass, the melting temperature becomes higher than 1400 C so that the processibility of the glasses decreases. In the glass compositions which are used according to the invention in optical fibres, ZnO and MgO improve in particular the corrosion resistance. MgO has a small effect on the refractive index as compared with CaO, ZnO, SrO and BaO, while it causes the light scattering to increase, and this is why it is preferably used in the core glass only in a quantity up to at most 5 trol. . With quantities exceeding 10 trol. in cladding glass A and 15 mol. in cladding glassB, the melting temperature becomes too high for use in optical fibres, while the light scattering also increases. CaO, ZnO, SrO and BaO have a refractive index increasing effect.ZnO is particularly suitable because it causes the Rayleigh scattering to increase only slightly or not to increase at all with increase in concentration. With concentrations larger than those indicated above, however, the tendency to crystallization of glasses rapidly increases. In cladding glass B, the lowest refractive index is obtained when ZnO and CaO are absent and only MtO is present. ZnO and CaO contents of the indicated percentages in the cladding glass B lead to a higher refractive index, it is true, but the corrosion resistance is also improved thereby. The alkali metal oxides reduce the melting temperature and therewith improve the meltability of the said glasses but reduce the corrosion resistance with increasing content for which reason at most 25 mol. is added. The total alkali metal oxide contents in mol. of the core glass and of the cladding glass are preferably mutually equal. In these circumstances galvanic cells which might give rise to buble formation in the double crucible cannot be formed in a platinum crucible when the glasses contact each other. Exchange of alkali metal ions between core glass and cladding glass during the manufacture of optical fibres according to the invention can be prevented by choosing the concentrations of each of the alkali metal oxides present in the core glass and in the cladding glass to be equal.In a preferred emicdiment of the invention the overall concentration is 15 mol. , of which Li2 0 3 mol. , Na20 6 rrol. and K20 6 itol. , with this composition the glass has a minimum melting temperature with a maximum corrosion resistance. Exchange of alkaline earth metal ions will occur with an optically noticeable effect only if the contact time between the core glass and the cladding glass at the processing temperature is suffi ciently long. An A1203 content exceeding 7.5 rrol. in the cladding glass B leads to an increase of the melting temperature to above the limit of 1400 C. A B203 content smaller than 5 mol. in cladding glass B leads to a melting temperature higher than 1400 C. This applies in particular to glasses with 15 tol. K20. B203 contents exceeding 15 mol. leads to a glass having too small a corrosion resistance. The quantity of ZrO2 Y203 is preferably 0 3 itol. . In the indication of the concentration Y2O3 is used because gram rrol. Y203 is comparable with 1 gram mol. ZrO2 as regards the number of gram atoms of yttrium and zirconium. ZrO2 and or Y203 is or are used in the core glass if a large numerical aperture is desired and the permissible quantity of BaO, CaO, SrO and or ZnO is not sufficient to reach the desired refractive index. In particular when ZrO2 is used together with the alkaline earth metal oxides CaO and SrO or together with ZnO, a synergistic effect appears to occur which is expressed in an extra increase of the refractive index above the increase which can be expected from the concentration ZrO2 as appears from the followingTable.Table Quantities in mol. SiO2 ZrO2 CaO SrO ZnO BaO Alkali metal n ox.5 Li20, 10 Na2O, 10K20 .75 25 1.5029 70 5 25 1.5337 62.5 12.5 25 1.5348 62.5 12.5 25 1.5349 62.5 12.5 25 1.5332 62.5 1 12.5 25 1.5552 57.5 5 12.5 25 1.5688 57.5 5 12.5 25 1.5723 57.5 5 12.5 25 1.5710 57.5 5 12.5 25 1.5860 As appears from the Table replacement of 5 rol. SiO2 by 5 mol. ZrO2 causes the refractive index in an alkali metal silicate glass to increase by 0.0308.In an alkali metal silicate glass which also comprises CaO, SrO or ZnO, the increase when replacing 5 mop. by 5 mol. ZrO2, however, is 0.0340, 0.0374 and 0.0378, respectively. For comparison, compositions with BaO are also recorded in which the increase proves to be the expected 0.0308. Similar effects occur when Y203 is used this latter oxide also improves the corrosion resistance of the core glass, while the crystallization tendency remains low. During the preparation of the glasses the usual refining agents may be used, for example, As203 and Sb203. Quantities up to 1 mol.e of As203 and or Sb203 are preferably added to the above mentioned ccmpcstions. It has been found that in practice this also leads to a lower demping in particular at 850 nm. The glasses can be prepared, for example, as follows. Starting materials are alkali metal carbonates and or nitrates the other metals mug, Ca, Sr, Ba and Zn may be used in the form of their oxides, carbonates or nitrates, SiO2 and B203 and or H3BO3 , ZrO2 and or ZrSiO4 , Y203 and Awl203 Materials of the best possible purity are always used. This means that the level of the impurities which absorb in the interesting wavelength ranges if possible is smaller than 0.01 ppm. The glass melts are kept at a temperature above the melting point for some time for example , 1 to 10 hours . Dry gases for example oxygen, carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide, saturated or not saturated with D20 can be blown through the melt for some time.Rods are drawn from the melts. Said rods serve as a starting material for the manufacture of optical fibres. The optical fibres can be manufactured in the manner known for the application of multicomponent glasses, for example, by means of a double crucible method. If desired, a second cladding of a particularly corrosion resistant glass may be provided via said method while using an extra crucible. Dependent on the distance between the outflow apertures of the two crucibles in a double crucible, exchange of alkaline earth metal ions will occur between the core and the cladding glass and a graded index fibre can be obtained. Exchange may occur, for example, between the ions of one or rrore of the alkaline earth metals Ba, Sr and Ca and Zn core glass and the magnesium ion cladding glass . At processing temperatures between 1000 and 1200 C, the distance must be larder than 500 nm. In the case of smaller distances, the contact time for an optically noticeable ion exchange is too small. The invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to the following specific examples.Example 1 An optical fibre was manufactured by means of a double crucible method from glasses of the following molecular composition Core glass Cladding glass 60 SiO2 62.5 SiO2 2.5 iY203 10 ZnO 5 ZnO 2.58 CaO 5 CaO 10 MtO 12.5 BaO 3 Li20 3 Li20 6 Na20 6 Na20 6 K20 6 K20Melting temperature 13500C 14000CRefractive index 1.582 1.5366Viscosity 1100 C 40 Pa.s 1100 C 80 Pa.s.
