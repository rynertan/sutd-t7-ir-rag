## Description
This invention relates to monoazo dyes and their application to textile materials. According to the invention, there are provided water soluble monoazo dyes which, in the form of the free acids, , have the formula EMI1.1 wherein R1 represents hydrogen or optionally substituted alkyl,R2 represents optionally substituted alkyl or optionally substituted aryl, Rr represents hydrogen, lialogen, lower alkyl or lower alkoxy, R4 represents hydrogen, halogen, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy or acylamino, represents hydrogen or optionally substituted alkyl and represents hydrogen, optionally substituted alkyl or optionally substituted aryl or R5 and 26 together with the attached nitrogen atom form a 5 or 6 membered heterocyclic ring. The expressions lower alkyl and lower alkoxy used herein mean alkyl and alkoxy groups having from one to four carbon ators. Optionally substituted alkyl radicals which flay be represented by R1, R2, R5 and R6 include, in particular, optionally substituted lower alkyl radicals, suitable substituents being halogen, hydroxy, cyano, acyloxy, alkoxycarbonyl and phenyl radicals. Optionally substituted aryl radicals which may be represented by R2 and R include optionally y substitut.cd phenyl radicals. Heterocyclic radicals which may be represented by R5, R6 and the nitrogen atom taken together include piperidino, morpholino and pyrrolidino radicals. Acylamino radicals which may be represented by X4 include acotylamino and benzoylamino. It is preferred that each of R1 and R2 is benzyl. The dye of tbe invention may be prepared by diazotising a primary amine of the formula EMI2.1 and coupling the resulting diazo compound with a coupling component of the formula EMI2.2 the symbols R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 and R6 having the meanings given above Primary amines of Formula II may be prepared by sulphonating 4 aminobenzenesulphonamides of the formula EMI2.3 wherein R5 and have the meanings given above. The 4 aminobenzenesulphonamides may themselves be made by rc acting A 4 nitro or 4 acylaminobenzenesulphonyl chloride with an amine R5R6NH and then reducing the nitro group or hydrolysing the acylamino group. The reactions leading to the formatit n of the dyes of the invention may be performed using bohditions that have beer fully described in the prior art for such reactions. Similarly, the dyes may be isolated by known methods and, as in the case of other dyes containing sulphonic acid groups, it is often convenient to isolate and se the dye in the form of their water soluble salts.particularly their alkali netal or ammonium silts and especially sodium salts. It is to be understood that the invention relates to both the free acids and their alts. The dyes of The invention are suitable for applying to polyamide textile materials such as wool and silk but especially to synthetic polyamide textile materials, for example nylon 66 and nylon 6, using any of the general methods known for the application of acid dyes to such materials. The dyes provide yellow td red shades having a high degree of fastness to wet treatments and to light. The dyes of the invention have the virtue of giving completely non phototropic shades on polyamide fibres and in this respect they are superior to dyes having closely related structures. Thus, dyes which have the sulphonic acid group in the radicals represented by R5 instead of in the position shown in Formula I exhibit marked phototropism, that is to cay a temporary change of shade on exposure to light, an effect which is undesirable on both furnishing and clothing fabrics. The invention is illustrated but not limited by the following Examples in which all parts and percentages are by weight. Example 1 A solution of 3.5 parts of sodium nitrate in as parts of water it added to a solution of 14.0 parts of 4 othylaminosulphonylaniline 2 sulphonic acid 100 strength in 500 parts of water and 5 parts of 32 sodium hydroxide solution at 0 5 C. 25 Parts of 35 hydrochloric ecid are then added and stirring is continued at 0 5 C for a further 30 minutes. The excess nitrous acid is then destroyed and the diazo suspension is added to a stirred solution of 13.7 parts of N,N dibenzylaniline in 750 parts of acetone at 20 C. Stirring is continued for a further 3 hours and the monoazo dyestuff is then filtered off and washed with water.The precipitate is suspended in 500 parts of water, 32 sodium hydroxide solution is added to adjust the pH to 7 and the resulting solution is evaporated to dryness. When applied to nylon 66 from a weakly acid bath, a strong reddich yellow shade is obtained which exhibits good wet and light fastness and is non phototropic. The 4 ethylaminosulphonylaniline 2 sulphonic acid used in this Example is prepared as follows 20 Parts of 4 ethylaminosulphonylaniline 100 strength are dissolved in 400 parts of stirred o dichlorobenzene dry at 80 C and after cooling to 20 25 C, 10 parts of sulphuric acid 98 strength are added. Stirring at 20 25 C is continued for 1 hour and the temperature is then gradually raised to reflux 180 C during 30 minutes. Stirring at reflux is continued for Q hours and the water produced is removed by distillation.After cooling to 20 C the precipitate is filtered off, washed with acetone and dried to give 26.3 parts 94 yield of 4 cthylaminostllphonyl aniline 2 sulphonic acid which analysed as follows Calc. C,34.3 H, 4.3 N, 10.0 S, 22.9 C8H12O5N2S2 Found C,34.1 H, 4.1 N, 10.3 S, 23.0 Example 2 A solution of 3.5 rarts of sodium nitrite in 25 parts Or water is added to a solution of 18.2 parts of 4 ethylhexyl aminosulphonyl aniline 2 sulphonic acid 100 strength in 500 parts of water and 5 parts of 32 sodium hydroxide solution at 0 5 C. 25 arts of 35 hydrochloric acid are then added and stirring at 0 5 C is continued for a further 30 minutes The excess nitrous acid is then destroyed and the diazo suspension is added to a stirred solution of 10.3 parts of 3 acetylamino N,N diethylaniline 10N, strength in 600 parts of water and 10 parts of 35 hydrochloric acid at 0 5 C. Saturated sodium acetate solution is then added to adjust the pI to 4 and stirring at 0 5 C is continued for 3 hours. 32 Sodium hydroxide sol olution is then added to adjust the pH to 9 and after adding 120 parts of sodium ci iloride, the precipitate is filtered off, washed with 10 brine solution and dried.When applied to nylon 66 from a weakly acid bath, a strong orange shade is obtained which exhibits good wet and light fastness and is non phototropic. The 4 ethylhexyl aminosulphonyl aniline 2 sulphonic acid used in this Example is made in 90 yield by the method described for 4 ethylaminosulphonylaniline 2 sulphonic acid inExample 1 replacing the 20 parts of 4 ethylaminosulphonylaniline by 28.4 parts of 4 ethylhexyl aminosulphonyl aniline.
