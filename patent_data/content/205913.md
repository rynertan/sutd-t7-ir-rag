## Description
This invention relates to batteries having polymeric electrodes. More particularly, this invention relates to non aqueous secondary batteries having negative electrodes composed of conjugated backbone polymers and alkali metals which are plated on or distributed throughout the polymer matrix. Conjugated backbone polymers, e.g, polyacetylene, polyphenylene, polyacenes, polythiophene, poly phenylene vinylene , polyazulene, poly phenylene sulfide , poly phenylene oxide , polythianthrene, poly phenylquinoline , polyaniline, poly N methyl carbazole , and polypyrrole, have been suggested for use in a variety of applications based upon their characteristic of becoming conductive when oxidized or reduced either chemically or electrochemically. The secondary battery application described by, e.g., MacDiarmid, et al. in US A 4 442 187 Lithium and lithium alloys have been suggested for use as the negative electrode in electrochemical cells. For example, US A 4 002 492 discloses electrochemical cells having an anode consisting essentially of lithium aluminum alloys that contain lithium in amounts between 63 and 92 and the balance essentially aluminum. Anodes composed of lithium and aluminum are also disclosed in Rao, et al., An application of Matsushita Kokai 58 163184 discloses the use of electroconductive polymer as a covering at the surface of the electrode to protect against short circuiting because of dendrite growth. EP A 0070107 Murphy, et al., Composite structures of a conjugated backbone polymer and a non electroactive material have been described in US A 4 294 304 and in the above While batteries have heretofore been constructed in which a conjugated backbone polymer comprises the largest part of the electroactive material, such batteries suffer from a number of disadvantages. For example, such cells have heretofore exhibited strongly varying discharge potentials. Moreover, such cells have relatively low volumetric energy densities. Batteries to be used at room temperature which are constructed with anodes composed of lithium or lithium alloys such as lithium aluminum alloys, also suffer from a number of disadvantages. While lithium is inherently rechargeable, it s practical rechargeability is poor because at practical current densities metallic lithium is electrodeposited in the form of dendrites which can eventually lead to shorting out the cell. High discharge rates can also result in irreversible shape changes in the electrode. In order to minimize the effects of dendritic growth, it has been suggested to employ cell separators, such as permeable membranes or the composite of JP A 58 163184, which act as physical barriers to dendritic growth. Although these solutions are initially effective, eventually the lithium dendrites may penetrate the barriers and establish transient or permanent electronic shorts. It has been suggested that use of alloys of lithium with a less reactive metal, as for example, alloys of lithium and aluminum obviate certain of the disadvantages attendant to the use of lithium as the anodic material. See, for example, US A 4002492. However, such batteries have exhibited relatively low capacities utilization , low rate capabilities and poor cycle lifes. Generally speaking, the present invention obviates one or more of the disadvantages of polymer batteries, and lithium and lithium alloy anode batteries by providing an improved anode for high energy density electrochemical cells which include a cathode containing a cathode active material, an anode containing an anode active material, and a non aqueous electrolyte having an ionic salt of the anode active material dissolved therein. More particularly, this invention provides a battery comprising an anode, a cathode and an electrolyte comprising an organic solvent containing a dissolved alkali metal salt. According to the invention, the anode comprises a porous conjugated backbone polymer substrate having a porosity of at least 20 volume percent, with an alkali metal in zero valent state dispersed through the substrate, the amounts of polymer and alkali metal in the charged state of the battery being 50 to 95 percent by weight of polymer, and correspondingly 5 to 50 percent by weight of alkali metal, based on total weight of polymer and alkali metal. If desired, the porous conjugated backbone polymer or copolymer can be blended with one or more conjugated or non conjugated backbone polymers. The conjugated polymer components are in a reduced n doped electronically conductive form during at least part of the battery cycle, having dispersed therein the elemental alkali metal. The alkali metal cations in said electrolyte diffuse into said porous polymer or copolymer and are deposited as elemental alkali metal during at least part of the charging cycle of said battery, and converted into alkali metal cations during the discharging of said battery. As an essential component, the battery of this invention includes an anode which comprises a mixture of one or more porous conjugated backbone polymers or copolymer, or blends of one or more conjugated polymers or copolymers with one or more conjugated or non conjugated backbone polymers or copolymers hereinafter referred to collectively as conjugated backbone polymers , with at least one or said conjugated backbone polymers being capable of electrochemical n doping insertion by alkali metal cations to an electronically conductive state 10 ³s cm , and which polymers, copolymers or blends having dispersed therein elemental alkali metal. The structure of this anode can vary widely. For example, the anode can be in the form of a porous film of the conjugated backbone polymer with the elemental alkali metal being dispersed therein. In the preferred embodiments, the anode is comprised of compressed powders of conjugated backbone polymers filled by elemental alkali metal which has been electrodeposited by reduction of alkali metal ions in a suitable non aqueous electrolyte at sufficiently low current density to achieve the desired dispersion of elemental alkali metal within the body of the electrode. Useful polymers may be any of the variety of electrochemically n dopable conjugated backbone polymers known to those of skill in the art for use as negative electrodes in batteries. In general, such polymers are sufficienlty porous to allow the inflow and outflow of electrolyte solvent containing dissolved alkali metal cations, and to provide sufficient space for the deposition of elemental alkali metal inside of the conjugated backbone polymer substrate during the charging and discharging of the battery, respectively. These objectives are achieved when the porosity of the polymer is at least 20 volume percent v o . In the preferred embodiments of the invention, the porosity of the polymer is at least 25 volume percent v o , and in the particularly preferred embodiments is from 30 volume percent v o , to 70 volume percent v o . Amongst these particularly preferred are those embodiments of the invention in which the porosity of the substrate is about 50 volume percent v o . Furthermore, the polymer must be of sufficient molecular weight to function as a solid substrate during the charging of the battery. Useful conjugated backbone polymers may be conjugated backbone homopolymers or copolymers, or blends of one or more conjugated backbone homopolymers or copolymers with one or more conjugated backbone or non conjugated backbone homopolymers or copolymers. Useful conjugated backbone polymers can vary widely and include polyacetylene, polyphenylene, if in the para form , poly phenylene vinylene and the like, and blends thereof with other polymers having either conjugated or non conjugated backbones, such as polyethylene or polypropylene. Other conjugated backbone polymers claimed by others as useful in batteries may also be used in the present invention. Such polymers include hydrocarbon polymers polyazulene, poly perinaphthalene , polyacenes, poly naphthalene 2,6 diyl , and the like and polymeric blends thereof. Amongst these illustrative conjugated backbone polymers, polyacetylene, poly phenylene vinylene and poly p phenylene are preferred, and polyacetylene and poly p phenylene are particularly preferred. Most preferred for use in the practice of this invention is poly p phenylene . Useful conjugated backbone polymers are known compounds which can be prepared by conventional means. For example, high quality polyacetylene, a preferred conjugated backbone polymer, can be conveniently prepared by the procedures described in a series of papers by Shirakawa, et al., The second essential component of the anode of this invention is elemental alkali metal which is distributed throughout the electrode. Preferred alkali metals are lithium and sodium, and particularly preferred for use is sodium. In the preferred embodiments of the invention, the alkali metal is electrodeposited on and or in the conjugated backbone polymer substrate in a step prior to battery assembly or during the charging of the battery. The porosity of the polymer substrate and current density are adjusted to achieve the necessary dispersal of alkali metal throughout the bulk of the polymer substrate. The amounts of the various components in the anode can vary widely, depending on a number of factors, as for example, the balance chosen between electrochemical capacity, and the porosity of the polymer, the desired mechanical properties of the anode and the like. In general, the amount of the conjugated backbone polymer component in the anode should be sufficient to provide useful capacities and to impart mechanical stability and good life cycle life to the electrode. According to the invention, the amount of the conjugated backbone polymer component is from 50 to 95 percent by weight based on the total weight of polymer and alkali metal in the anode, and in the particularly preferred embodiments from 70 to 90 by weight, on the aforementioned basis. The anode may include other optional materials known to those of skill in the battery art, and these will not be described herein in great detail. In brief, by way of illustrative examples, the anode may include such other substituents as conductivity aids such as carbon black inert binders such as saturated backbone hydrocarbon polymers and halocarbon polymers such as polyethylene, propylene trifluoroethylene copolymer, and poly tetrafluoroethylene mechanical supports current collectors and the like. Hydrocarbon binders such as polypropylene are generally employed with powdered forms of theconjugated polymers. The anode may also be coated with other materials to allow use of the anode with solvents which would otherwise react with the conjugated backbone polymer in the reduced state. For example, the anode can be coated with the reaction product of an oxirane compound as described in US A 4 472 487 with the reaction product of an organsulfur compound as described in US A 4 472 489 and with the reaction product of certain cyclic compounds as described in US A 4 472 488. The particular polymer and alkali metal chosen for use in any particular situation may vary widely. However, in the preferred embodiments of the invention, the polymer and metal are selected such that the voltage range of reversible electroactivity of the polymer closely matches or more preferably encompasses the electrochemical potential of the alkali metal. The method of fabricating the anode is not critical and can be varied widely. Any method known to those of skill in the art for fabricating polymer substrates having porosity in the ranges of 25 to 75 volume percent can be used. In the preferred embodiments, the anode is fabricated as follows. The polymer which is conjugated or becomes conjugated in its reduced state is in the form of a dry powder, a gel, or a suspension in a suitable solvent. This conjugated polymer may be combined with other additives, such as binders and conductivity aids. This mixture is mechanically or ultrasonically blended or ground together to form an intimate mixture of small particles less than 10 µm . This mixture is then compressed onto a current collector into the desired shape of the electrode. In some instances, it may be further desirable to carry out a final heat setting step. The conditions of the final pressing and heat setting step are adjusted to achieve the desired porosity. The conjugated polymer of this electrode may be chemically or electrochemically reduced to an n type conducting state, preferably after electrode fabrication, but either before or after cell or battery assembly. Finally, excess alkali metal in a zero valent state elemental alkali metal is added to the electrode preferably by electrodeposition either prior to final assembly or during the charging of said battery or electrochemical cell. The current density for the electrodeposition must be maintained at a sufficiently low value to avoid the production of dendrites at the electrode surface and to achieve a dispersal of alkali metal within the interior of the porous electrode. The organic solvents which may be included in the electrolyte of the batteries of the present invention may vary widely and can be organic solvents normally used in batteries. Preferably, these solvents should be electrochemically inert to oxidation and reduction during use while simultaneously being capable of dissolving the desired alkali metal salt at a concentration of preferably about 0.5M and more preferably about 1M, capable of wetting the polymer, and providing an ionic conducitivity equal to or in excess of 10 ⁴S cm, preferably equal to or greater than 10 ²S cm. Examples of such useful organic solvents include propylene carbonate, ethylene carbonate, sulfolane, methyl sulfolane, dimethyl sulfolane, 3 methyl 2 oxazolidone, alkane sultones, e.g., propane sultone, butane sultone the use of sultones as electrolyte compositions is the subject of a related, commonly assigned U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 556,717, now US A 4 528 254, and the use of sultones for coatings on polymer anodes is the subject of a related, commonly assigned US A 4 472 489 , dimethyl sulfoxide DMSO , dimethyl sulfite, tetrahydrofuran THF , 2 methyltetrahydrofuran 2 MTHF , dioxane, dioxolane, 1 2 dimethoxyethane DME , dimethoxymethane, diglyme and glymes. Mixtures of such available organic solvents may also be ued, such as mixtures of sulfolane and dimethoxyethane, or mixtures of propylene carbonate and dimethoxyethane. The organic solvents chosen for use in any particular situation will, of course, depend upon many factors such as the precise electrolyte composition used and the voltage range desired, as well as the choice of cathode and other components of the battery used. A particularly important consideration in choosing a solvent is whether the n doped conjugated backbone polymer employed is subject to attack of the solvent. In the preferred embodiments of the invention when either coated or uncoated anodes are employed, ether type solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, dimethoxyethane, diglyme, 2 methyltetrahydrofuran and mixtures thereof are employed because these solvents are generally not reactive with conjugated backbone polymers, when in their neutral or reduced forms. Salts for use in the electrolyte of the battery of this invention are of the formula Cathodes for use in the practice of this invention are not critical and can be varied widely. Suitable cathodes include materials selected from the group consisting of graphite, intercalation compounds of graphite, high surface area carbons 200 m² g , polymers which are capable of being oxidized acceptor doped . Transition metal chalcogenides and conjugated backbone polymers are preferred cathode materials, especially those having an operating voltage about equal to or greater than 1.5V with respect to the anode. The transition metal chalcogenides, suitable as cathode materials useful in this invention, can contain inserted alkali metals and include the transition metal dichalcogenides such as TiS₂ and, among others, those listed on page 392 of Lithium Batteries edited by J. P. Gabano Academic Press, 1983 and in K. M. Abraham, Solid State Ionics, Vol. 7, pp. 199 212 1982 both incorporated herein by reference . These include with approximate open circuit potentials measured in various organic electrolytes when fully charged nearly or devoid of inserted cations Suitable polymer cathodes include oxidized polyacetylene, poly p phenylene , polyacenes, poly phenylene vinylene , polyazulene, polynaphthalene, poly phenylene sulfide , poly phenylene oxide , polyphenothiazine, polyaniline, polypyrrole, polythiophene, polythianthrene and substituted versions of the above. Such polymers may be coated by reaction, when oxidized, with pyrroles, thiophenes, azulenes, anilines or furans, as described in US A 4 472 988. The secondary battery of this invention can be charged and discharged in accordance with the procedure described in US A 4 321 114. Such procedures are well known to those of skill in the art and will not be described herein in any great detail. The following specific examples are presented to more particularly illustrate the invention. As assembled, the battery of Example I contained enough sodium for approximately 80 theoretical capacity 4 mAh if no sodium were lost to reaction with impurities during initial cycling. More sodium 2.5 mAh was added by inserting a third electrode composed of sodium and passing charge between this sodium electrode and the PPP electrode. The cell PPP vs NaCoO₂ was cycled between fixed voltage limits, 3.6 to 1.6V, at a current of 1 mA 0.6 mA cm² for the first 8 cycles the sodium reference being removed after cycle 5 , then at 2 mA 1.2 mA cm² until cycle number 172 and then at 1 mA until cycle number 223 where cycling was terminated. Because excess sodium was added, it was found on the 8th cycle that the PPP electrode attained a potential of OV vs Na NA with sodium metal being plated and stripped from this electrode over about 75 of its observed 4 mAh capacity i.e., about 3 mAh of sodium was being plated and stripped as sodium metal on each cycle . On cycle 194 when the overall capacity of the cell had declined to about 3 mAh, sodium metal was still being plated and stripped over about 75 of the cell s capacity 2.25 mAh . Thus, very little sodium metal was lost in the 194 cycles and high efficiency for sodium plating and stripping on a PPP substrate has been demonstrated. No evidence for shorting due to sodium dendrites was found over the entire 223 cycles. A half cell was assembled which comprised a PPP electrode constructed as in Example I and a sodium reference and counter electrode in an electrolyte of 1M NaPF₆ in DME. An initial cycle was made between 1.5 and 0.0 volts vs Na Na such that Na ions were inserted and extracted from PPP without the plating of sodium metal. Three more cycles were then made summarized in the Table I below which involved both the insertion and extraction of Na ions in PPP and plating of sodium metal on the electronically conductive substrate comprised of the sodium ion complex with PPP. The cycling results demonstrate high efficiency for the plating and stripping of sodium from a conductive PPP substrate. A battery was assembled as described in Example I with a
