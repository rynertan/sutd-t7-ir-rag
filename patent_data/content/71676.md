## Description
ORGANOTIN POLYMERS, METHOD OF MAKING THEM AND PAINTS CONTAINING THEM. This invention relates to organotin polymers such as are useful in antifouling paints. The use of trialkyl and triaryl organotin compounds to inhibit the attachment and growth of barnacles, algae and other organisms responsible for fouling is well known. Tributyltin and triphenyltin compounds have gained particular importance as biocides in antifouling paints. The use of organotin compounds purely as additives in paint formulations has certain disadvantages, such as their high mammalian toxicity, non durability and unpleasant odour. The advent of organotin polymers to overcome these disadvantages and their subsequent use in antifouling paints has been well known for many years. Organotin groups in polymers are not significantly toxic to the organisms which it is desired to kill. The success of such paints is due to the fact that the polymers undergo a slow hydrolysis, providing a controlled release of organotin groups which is maintained over many months or years. Organotin groups have been incorporated in polymers by means of ether and ester linkages. Both have disadvantages. For example, bis tri n butyltin oxide or triphenyl tin hydroxide may be reacted with a hydroxyl containing polymer to give a polymer containing organotin groups joined to the backbone by means of ether linkages.This type of polymer has poor antifouling properties as the organotin ether linkage is not readily hydrolysable in a marine enviroment, so that the release of biocide is inadequate to prevent fouling. Alternatively, bis tri n butyltin oxide or triphenyltin hydroxide may be reacted with a carboxylcontaining polymer to give a polymer containing organotin groups joined to the backbone by means of ester linkages. This process has the disadvantage that the starting carboxyl containing polymers are not very soluble in inert solvents which are required for the reaction between carboxyl group and organotin compounds. The present invention provides an organotin polymer, which may be prepared from a hydroxyl containing polymer, and which contains organotin groups joined to the polymer backbone by ester linkages. The polymer can be made by modification of existing commercially available polymers which are already in use, e.g. for marine paints. The resulting organotin containing polymers are readily hydrolysed in a marine environment, and therefore have good antifouling properties. The invention provides an organotin polymer, derived from a hydroxyl containing polymer having a hydroxyl value of from 50 to 400, containing pendent groups having the following general formula O.CO.R1CO.OSnR3 Where R is C1 to C10 alkyl, aryl, aralkyl or alkaryl, and R1 is a saturated or unsaturated aliphatic or aromatic C2 to C10 group. These polymers may be formed by reacting a hydroxyl containing polymer with a carboxylic acid anhydride Rl CO 20 under conditions to open the ring and react one, but not both, of the resulting carboxyl groups with a hydroxyl group of the polymer, and then reacting the resulting carboxyl containing polymer with an organotin compound such as an organotin oxide or hydroxide. The hydroxyl containing polymer has a hydroxyl value of from 50 to 400, preferably from 125 to 300. Suitable are polymers of allyl alcohol with styrene, particularly in mole ratios from 1 1 to 1 10.The styrene gives a harder polymer, and improves the film forming, drying and film properties of the resulting paint. In place of styrene may be used other vinyl aromatic monomers such as vinyl toluene or alphamethyl styrene or acrylic monomers such as methyl methacrylate. In place of allyl alcohol may be used a hydroxy acrylate ester such as the 2 hydroxy ethyl or 2 hydroxy propyl ester of acrylic or methacrylic acid. The nature of the polymer is chosen to have a desired range of properties for the resulting product, e.g. a marine paint. The physical properties of the polymer can be modified by reaction with a fatty acid, such as soya oil fatty acid or tall oil fatty acid, prior to reaction with the anhydride. The fatty acid acts as an internal plasticizer. Alternatively a plasticising monomer, e.g. butyl acrylate, can be copolymerised into the backbone. The molecular weight of the polymer is chosen to give a convenient viscosity for the intended end use, e.g. in a marine paint. As the carboxylic acid anhydride, there may be used any cyclic anhydride such as for example, maleic anhydride, succinic anhydride, phthalic anhydride, trimellitic anhydride, the reaction product of maleic anhydride with.butadiene, or the reaction product of maleic anhydride with cyclopentadiene. This is reacted with the hydroxyl containing polymer under conditions to effect ring opening of the anhydride but not to cause crosslinking of the polymer. Ordinary reaction conditions for this conventional reaction may be used, suitable temperatures being from 1300C to 155 C. The ring opening reaction may be monitored by measurement of acid value by aqueous titration. Provided that it is capable of reacting with carboxyl groups, the nature of the organotin compound is not critical. It may for example be an oxide or hydroxide. The three organic groups attached to the or each tin atom may be the same or different.Tributyltin and triphenyltin compounds are most generally used. Preferred reaction temperatures are in 0 the range 80 170 C. The reaction may conveniently be performed under reflux in an inert organic solvent such as xylol which boils at a suitable temperature. Progress of the reaction may be monitored by collecting the evolved water. The resulting polymer preferably contains 10 to 25 by weight, particularly 15 to 20 by weight of tin.When the proportion of tin is below 10 by weight, the antifouling properties of the polymer may not be sufficientl It is not easily possible to incorporate more than about 25 by weight of tin by means of ester linkages into an organic polymer. Under some circumstances it may be preferable to leave a proportion of hydroxyl or carboxyl groups in the polymer to improve its leaching and or hydrolysis properties. More usually, however, equivalent amounts of the reactants are used so that one organotin group is introduced for each hydroxyl group in the starting polymer. These organotin polymers may also be useful as antifungal preservatives for timber. The organotin polymers of this invention may in principle be formed by other methods, though the method described above is preferred a The carboxylic acid anhydride may be reacted with a hydroxyl containing monomer, and the resulting monomer homopolymerised or copolymerised. The organotin compound is then reacted with pendent carboxyl groups in the resulting polymer.b The organotin compound is reacted with the carboxylic acid anhydride, and the resulting tincontaining carboxylic acid reacted with a hydroxylcontaining polymer.
