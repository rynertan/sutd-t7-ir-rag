# INK JET PRINTER AND METHOD OF PRINTER OPERATION

## Abstract
An ink jet printer includes a print head for generating a plurality of groups 88,90, etc, 92,94, etc, and 96,98 etc. of jet drop streams 50 arranged in a first row in which the jet drop streams in each of the groups are uniformly spaced along the row and interspersed with jet drop streams in each of the other groups. A plurality of charge electrodes 52 are provided with each electrode positioned adjacent one of the jet drop streams. A deflection electrode provides a deflection field through which the jet drop streams pass, whereby drops charged to a catch charge level or a guard charge level are deflected to a catcher. Control means repetitively applies print control signals in sequence to the charge electrodes associated with each group of jet drop streams, while simultaneously applying a guard signal to the remaining charge electrodes. This arrangement results in predictable drop to drop and interlet crosstalk which may be compen sated by a shift in charge voltage levels.
