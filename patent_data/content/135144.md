## Description
This invention relates to a liquid gas injection system for introducing mixtures of pure oxygen or oxygenenriched gas and inert purge liquid into wet oxidation reactors internally clad or lined with titanium and operating at elevated temperatures and pressures. Wet oxidation is a well known process for treatment of aqueous solutions or suspensions, and comprises liquid phase oxidation using an oxygen containing gas at elevated pressure and temperature see for example U.SPatent 2,665,249. Commercial use of pure oxygen or an oxygenenriched gas in wet oxidation systems is a recent development. The potential for fires and or explosions when using concentrated oxygen is well documented in the prior art, necessitating specific equipment and procedures to ensure safe operation. The prior art dealing with safe operation of such wet oxidation systems is limited. Wet oxidation of some materials results in a mixture within the reactor which is highly corrosive to conventional materials of construction such as steel or the stainless steels. In such cases the reactor may be lined or clad with titanium to withstand the corrosivity of the reactor contents at the elevated temperatures and pressures. The use of pure oxygen or oxygen enriched air generally exacerbates the corrosion problem. The design of the oxygen inlet nozzle in such a system requires special consideration for the following two major reasons 1. High corrosivity of the reactor contents necessitates that the oxygen inlet nozzle be constructed of titanium Other conventional corrosion resistant materials such as Hastalloy C 276, Carpenter 20 Cb3 and stainless steel are unsatisfactory in exposure to the corrosive reactor contents. 2. Titanium is unsatisfactory as an oxygen inlet nozzle because exposure to oxygen rich gas at wet oxidation temperatures and pressures may lead to spontaneous combustion of the metal and catastrophic failure. Although titanium is very corrosion resistant, it has been shown to be capable of under going spontaneous combustion under certain conditions in the pre sence of oxygen and water at elevated pressures, as reported by F.E. Littman and F.M. Church in Final Report Reactions of Titanium with Water and Aqueous Solution, Stanford Research Institute Project No. SD 2116, June 15, 1958. This dilemma is not addressed by any of the following four publications and patent application, all of which disclose the introduction of air and or oxygen into wet oxidation systems. In Pradt et al U.S. Patent 4,174,280, wet oxidation of oxidizable materials which are insoluble, immiscible and difficult to suspend or emulsify in water, is performed by separately injecting the oxidizable materials into a sealed reactor as a separate concentrated stream. Air or oxygen is introduced into the reactor either as a separate stream or as a mixture with water or aqueous solutionor rsu i j i Contact between oxidizable materials, water and oxygen occurs in the reactor, thus preventing premature oxidation of slugs of the oxidizable matter. U.S. Patent No. 4,369,115 of Bauer discloses a method for introducing pure oxygen or an oxygen enriched gas into the liquid within a wet oxidation reactor. Chowdhury et al U.S. Patent No. 4,395,339, discloses methods for operating pure oxygen wet oxidation systems but does not address the specific mechanical details of the equipment. Bauer et al U.S. Patent No. 4,384,959 discloses methods for achieving safe, relatively low oxygen concentrations in the presence of combustible materials in wet oxidation systems. Chowdhury et al copending U.S. Patent ApplicationSerial No. 346,646, filed February 8, 1982 discloses a nozzle which allows a mixture of oxygen and purge water to be injected into a wet oxidation reactor without being prematurely heated. However, none of the above disclosures teach safe introduction of pure oxygen or oxygen enriched gas into a wet oxidation reactor internally clad or lined with titanium or other metal which may burn in the presence of oxygen at wet oxidation temperatures and pressures. Apparatus for such safe introduction is not shown in any of these patents. The present invention is an liquid gas injection system in a titanium clad or titanium lined wet oxidation reactor which vercomes both the problem of titanium fires due to high oxygen concentrations and the problem of excessive corrosion of non titanium materials such as Hastalloy alloy C 276, Carpenter 20 Cb 3 and the stainless steels. In this invention pure oxygen or oxygen enriched air and a purge liquid are conveyed in a non titanium pipe, which itself is kept isolated from the corrosive environment in the wet oxidation reactor. The non titanium pipe is surrounded by an outer titanium pipe creating an annular space wherein a continuous flow of liquid water or an aqueous slurry non corrosive to the inner pipe, or other non corrosive liquid, is maintained, simultaneously substantially preventing a contact of corrosive reactor contents with the corrodable nontitanium pipe and b contact of pure oxygen or oxygenenriched air with the combustible titanium pipe and inner reactor wall before dilution with carbon dioxide or other inert gas within the reactor. The present invention uses an inlet pipe assembly for injecting a mixture of pure oxygen gas or oxygen enriched air and inert, that is, non corrosive purge liquid into a corrosive wet oxidation mixture within a wet oxidation reactor vessel having wall or walls internally lined or clad with titanium. The inlet pipe assembly comprise a. an outer pipe fabricated of titanium, pass ing through the reactor vessel wall, with a discharge end within the reactor vessel b. an inner pipe concentric to and within the outer pipe, forming an annular space between the inner and outer pipes, with a discharge end within the reactor vessel.The inner pipe is made of material which is less reactive than titanium in an oxygen rich atmosphere c. means to maintain a continuous inflow of inert purge liquid or a mixture of pure oxygen gas or oxygen enriched air and inert purge liquid through the inner pipe into the wet oxidation reactor vessel and d. means to maintain within the annular space a continuous inflow of a second liquid low in molecular oxygen and less corrosive than said wet oxidation mixture. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 is a sidaview of an embodiment of this invention wherein the inlet pipe assembly passes through the reactor vessel side wall. Figure 2 is a sideview of a further embodiment in which the inlet pipe assembly enters the reactor vessel through its bottom. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Figure 1 shows an embodiment of the present invention where the inlet pipe assembly enters the vertical wet oxidation reactor through the side wall.Although the assembly may pass through the side wall at any angle, it is preferred that the angle ffi between the inlet pipes and reactor side wall be between 450 and 900 as measured downward from their intersection on the outside of the reactor wall. In Figure 1, outer pipe fabricated of titanium, passes through reactor vessel wall 2 and liner or cladding 3 at an angle a and has a discharge end within the reactor. Inner pipe is located within outer pipe and concentric to it, forming an annular space 6 between the inner and outer pipes. Inner pipe 3 is made of a material which is less reactive than titanium in an oxygen rich atmosphere, and has a discharge end 7 coterminous or nearly coterminous with discharge end 4 of the outer pipe as further described hereinafter. A continuous inflow g of an inert purge liquid or a mixture of pure oxygen gas or oxygen enriched air and inert purge liquid is introduced into inner pipe 5 and is discharged into the reactor vessel at discharge end 7 to mix with the corrosive wet oxidation mixture 9.The oxygen introduced through pipe 5 results in oxidation of combustibles in the liquid phase within the reactor.During certain periods of operation, for example during start up and shut down of the wet oxidation system, it may be necessary to introduce inert purge liquid only, without any oxygen or oxygen enriched air through the inner pipe 5. This purge liquid faust be chemically nonreactive with oxygen at wet oxidation temperatures and perferably have a vapor pressure dependence on temperature such that considerable vaporization occurs at wet oxidation temperatures to dilute the oxygen gas within the reactor. Water generally comprises the inert purge liquid. The oxygen concentration in the oxidant gas introduced in stream Jl through inner gas pipe is 25 to 100 percent, and is reactive with titanium at such high concentrations under the possible wet oxidation conditions. A continuous aqueous stream 10 is introduced into the annular space 6 between inner pipe 5 and outer pipe 1. This stream is discharged from the discharge end 4 and mixes with inflow8 asboth streams enter the re action zone containing wet oxidation mixture 9. The relatively cool flow 10 surrounds the flow 8 of oxidant, preventing contact of pure or concentrated oxygen with the titanium pipe 1 until sufficient mixing with the reactor contents and or reaction has occurred. In either case, the remaining oxygen is diluted with steam and CO2, eliminating the possibility of a titanium fire. Likewise, the corrosive reaction mixture a is prevented from contact with corrodable inner pipe 5 by the flow of streams 8, and 10. Thus, inner pipe 5 is protected from corrosion and outer pipe 1 is protected from burning. The discharge ends and are oriented so that the flows of oxidant are directed away from the titanium vessel inner wall 3. The flow iaay be upward, downward, or lateral in direction. Of course, cnce the streams are discharge into the reactor and are heated by the reactor contents 9, the oxygen rapidly reacts with combustibles within the reactor. The annulus aqueous stream 10 which surrounds inner pipe 5 in this apparatus may be ordinary process water, produced water from heavy oil processing operations, wastewater, an aqueous slurry of the fuel to be wet oxidized, or any other aqueous stream which is a part of the wet oxidation process. Preferably the dissolved or suspended oxygen in this liquid is less than 2000 ppm. While outer pipe 1 is fabricated of titanium, inner pipe 5 is comprised of a material less subject to combustion by concentrated oxygen, typically stainless steel, Carpenter 20 Cb3, Hastalloy C 276 or even carbon steel. Such metals are subject to rapid corrosion under the highly corrosive conditions created in the high temperature, high pressure wet oxidation reactions. In the preferred embodiment of this invention, the distance between the discharge end of the inner pipe and the discharge end of the outer pipe, as measured along the centerline of the pipes, is less than the diameter of the outer pipe, multiplied by 2.0, and most perferably, multiplied by 0.6. In order to prevent unwanted contact of reaction mixture ss with the inner pipe 4 and oxygen with outer pipe , the velocity of liquid in stream ss is preferably maintained at 0.25 to 20 feet per second, and more preferably at 1 10 feet per second. It is preferred that the Reynold s Number of this stream exceeds 3000. Likewise, the flow 8 of inert purge liquid, without any concurrent gas flow, is preferably maintained at 0.25 to 15 feet per second through inner pipe . More preferably, the velocity is maintained at 0.5 to 5 feet per second, with a Reynold s Number of the liquid alone exceeding 3000. In the embodiment illustrated in Figure 2, the streams 2 and 10 are introduced through the reactor bottom rather than through the sidewall. The apparatus comprises outer titanium pipe 11 having discharge end 12, and inner pipe 13 comprised of a material relatively non reactive to oxygen. Pipe B has discharge endIntroduction of inflow 8 and stream 2 are aE previously described. The discharge ends 12 and 14 may optionally be flared inward and or outward to achieve the desired velocities of streams 8 and ss as they pass into and mix with reactor contents 9. This apparatus, used as described above enables the safe introduction of concentrated oxygen into a high temperature high pressure wet oxidation reactor having reactive titanium walls, where the reaction mixture containing highly reactive fuel is also very corrosive to conventional non titanium materials of construction. EXAMPLE a wet oxidation system using pure oxygen with the reactor constructed of titanium is to be operated at the following conditions Reactor Temperature, OF 600 Reactor pressure, psig 2,000 2 Flow Rate, lbs hr. 8,800 Purge Water Flow Rate, lbs hr. 2,200 Annulus Water Flow Rate, lbs hr. 41,330 Inlet Temperature of Annulus Water, OF 60 The submerged oxygen nozzle is designed to enter the bottom of the reactor as follows 1. Inner pipe for O2 purge water flow 11 2 diameter, Schedule 80 Hastelloy alloy C 276, Carpenter 20 Cb3 or other such material which does not burn easily in purge 2 30 inches long. 2. Outer pipe 3 diameter, schedule 80 titanium 30 inches long. Assuming an overall heat transfer coefficient of 300 BTU hr ft2 OF between the reactor contents and the water in the annulus, the discharge temperature of water into the reactor will be approximately 690F. The velocity of water in the annulus is about 7 ft sec. The corresponding Reynold s Number is 54,830 which assures high turbulence in the annulus so that the inner O2 purge water pipe remains completely submerged in the annulus water and is isolated from the wet oxidation reaction media. The velocity of purge water stream alone in the inner pipe is approximately 0.8 ft sec. with a corresponding Reynold s Number of 8,070 which will insure high turbulence in the 0,2inlet line so as to prevent any backflow of wet oxidation reactor contents even at zero O2 flow.
