## Description
Pneumatic device for unloading pulverulent or granular materials from containers.The present invention refers to a pneumatic device for unloading pulverulent materials cement, flour, inert powders, etc. or granular materials pellets, grains, crushed stone, etc. from containers or container cells, either stationary or of the mobile type that is, installed on trucks, trailers, freight cars and the like.As is known, the extraction of polverulent or granular materials from the above mentioned type of container is carried out by blowing compressed air into it in order to pressurize the container. The air is blown in through special fixed distribution nozzles, usually located at the bottom of the container. When the internal pressure reaches a pre set value, the unloading duct is opened and the material ochres out prevalently due to the difference in pressure between the inside and the outside and, secondarily, due to the drag force exercised by the compressed air itself.The containers of the above mentioned type are generally cylindrical in form, with a truncated cone bottom which favors the flow of material toward the zone of extraction.In order to avoid that some of the materials remains on the bottom, its section must not be greater than the area over which the compressed air works. This fact determines a sensible reduction in the overall useful volume of the container, with an equal area of the cylindrical portion and in relation to the total height. Further, it must be noted that the smaller the volume of the truncated cone section of the container, the greater is the level of its center of gravity with respect to the bottom this has a negative influence on its stability at full load, especially if it is installed on a vehicle, which, to avoid the risk of turning over, must control their speed very carefully. For the above reasons, it seems clear that these problems are directly related to the system of compressed air immission on the bottom of the container during the unloading phase.It is the object of the present invention a pneumatic device for unloading polverulent or granular materials from fixed or mobile containers capable of resolving the above mentioned problems by providing an efficient system of compressed air immission capable of working on successive portions of the bottom of the container until the entire area is covered thus the most suitable dirnension of the container can be selected, without taaing into account the range of action of the air immission system, as is necessary when designing the containers of the known art.According to the invention, therefore, a pneumatic device for unloading pulverulent or granular materials from fixed or mobile containers is provided, connected with the compressed air generator through a feed conduit which sends said compressed air toward the bottom of the container, and which moreover is provided with a valved outlet conduit for unloading the material outside the container, characterized by the fact that it includes a plurality of fixed radial conduits on the bottom of said container and a compressed air distributor unit located centrally with respect to said radial conduits and operatively connected to said air feed conduit, for successively connecting this last with each of said radial conduits which, at their ends, are equipped with means for the distribution of the compressed air into the mass of material lying on said bottom, working on successive, adjacent portions thereof. In one particularly advantageous embodiment of the invention, said radial conduits are inside a disc shaped body located at the bottom of the con tainer which also makes up the bottom of the container itself. In particular, moreover, the distributor may be made to rotate with a suitable motor or by the action of the flow of the compressed air itself which presses on radial baffles suitably set within said distribution unit.The characteristics as well as the advantages of the pneumatic device according to the present invention will be clerer from the following description of preferred embodiments, described by way of example but in no way limiting, with reference to the attached drawings, in which figure 1 is a schematic view of a container cell for pulverulent or granular materials, on the bottom of which is installed the pneumatic device according to a first embodiment of the invention figure 2 shoves a partial cross sectional view of the pneumatic device as shown in figure 1 figure 3 shows a partial plan view of the same device along arrows III III of figure 2 figure 4 is a schematic view of a container cell for pulverulent or granular materials, on the bottom of which is installed the pneumatic device according to another embodiment of the invention figure 5 shows a top plan view of the bottom of said cell figure 6 illustrates cross sectional view of said bottom, along arrows VI VI of figure 5.With reference to figure 1,the numeral 1 indicates a traditional container cell for loose pulverulent or granular materials, suitable for both fixed installation and for mobile installation on road or railway vehicles, and provided with a truncated cone bottom 1a. The numeral 2 indicates an air compressor driven by a motor 3 4 indicates a conduit for the compressed air from compressor 2 to the bottom of container 1. 5 indicates an outlet conduit for the material, provided with an interception valve 6 and a convergent inlet ene Sa above the bottom of container 1. Container bottom substantially comprises two coaxial members a centrally rotating air distributor 7 and a discoidal body 8 pivotally supporting said distributor 7 and extending around it, said body being fixed to container 1.The axis upon which the air distributor 7 rotates is essentially coincident with the vertical axis of symmetry of container 1.As is shown in greater detail in figures 2 and 3, both the distributor 7 and the discoidal body 8 are hollow. In particular, distributor 7 is a ring shaped unit with a substantially inverted t1 shaped cross section, the inner portion of said section being pivotally connected to a shaft 10 coaxial to container 1 through bearings 9.The lower part of distributor 7 is closed by a circular expansion 11 shown in detail in the above mentioned figure 3 formed at the end of conduit 4 for the compressed air, provided with a central opening 12 for engaging a correspondent portion of shaft 10 to which it is secured with a lock ring 13. In this manner, air distributor 7 communicates with air compressor 2 through conduit 4.Distributor 7 is internally equipped with a plurality of equally spaced radial baffles 14, onto which the force of the compressed air coming from conduit 4 is applied said force moves them continually and as a result determines the possibility of continuous rotation of distributor 7.Discoidal body 8 is in its turn made up of two plates 8a and 8b, superimposed and spaced apart, which are concave with a different concavity but which in both cases is directed toward the bottom of the container. upper plate 8a constitutes the proper bottom of container 1, on which the material contained therein lies, while 3ower plate 8b is ring shaped with an internal diameter substantially equal to the external diameter of distributor 7. The two plates, 8a and 8b, are fixed together by means of a plurality of radial sectors 15 which define an equal number of radial conduits 16 between said plates. Discoidal body 8 presents a central housing 17 which forms the seat of rotating air distributor 7 and onto which the entrances of the radial conduits 16 face. The peripheral edge of plate 8b is bent toward the interior of container 1 forming a continuous annular rim 18. Rim 18 is partially superimposed over a corresponding rim 19 formed at the periphery of plate8a, a narrow passage 20 being defined between rims 18 and 19, which are inverse ly sloped with respect to plates 8a and 8b. Passage 20 is substantially faced toward the center of the bottom and put into communication radial conduits 16 with the interior of container 1.On the outside wall of the distributor 7, i.e. the one facing the entrances of the radial conduits 16, there is an opening 21 which, as the distributor rotates due to the action of the compressed air, comes to correspond with each said entrances so putting the radial conduits 16 into communication with the inside of the distributor 7.The above description makes obvious the manner in which the rotating pneumatic device according to the present invention operates. In particular, it has to be noted the fact that the injection of air, distributed uniformly over the entire bottom surface of container 1, forms, when a pulverulent material is present therein, a mixture of air and said material, which, due to itsdensity, lower than the one of the material alone, and the difference in pressure between the inside and the outside favors a uniform unloading of the material through outlet conauit 5.Moreover, the larger surface of the bottom, which is possible thanks to the more efficient air injection, allows for a creater storage capacity with equal height of the truncated cone section of the bottom and, consequently, also a lowering of the center of gravity of the container as a whole.And finally, it is to be noted that, in comparison with known pneumatic unloading devices, when using a compressor of the same power, a greater flowrate of unload material is obtained, with a consequent reduction in time required for the unloading operations.According to a particularly advantageous embodiment of the presente invention, the two side edges 21a and 21b of opening 21 are trimmed, that is, the shearing section of their thickness is inclined at a certain angle with re spect to the radial orientation. Moreover, conduit 4 is of quadrilateral section and is provided with an air flow diverter 22 operated by means of crank 23, which allows for directing the flow of air toward the right or toward the left with respect te the axial direction of the conduit itself. Thus the speed of rotation of distributor 7, determined by the action of the flow of air onto radial baffles 14 and by the reaction the same provokes in sectors 15, can be varied as necessary, given that said action and reaction of the air flow are summed algebraically.In particular, with reference to figure 3, if the flow is directed toward the left, so provoking a clockwise rotation of distributor 7, the reaction of the flow of air onto the sectors 15 will provoke an increase in speed if, instead, the flow is directed toward the right, so determining a counterclockwise rotation of distributor 7, the reaction will cause a slowdown of the movement of distributor 7. The possibility of adjusting the rotation speed of the distributor improves the operating adaptability of the device in the sense that is is possible to select the most favourable working conditions for the type of material to be unloaded. It has been observed, for example, that low rotation rates are more suited to granular materials, while with pulve rulent materials the best results are obtained when high rates are used.It is clear that, even if in the present description reference has been made exclusively to cylindrical container cells whose bottom is in the form of a truncated cone, the unloading device according to the present invention may be advantageously applied to otherwise shaped containers or to multiple type containers, made up of a single container structure, internally subdivised with sectors into cells which may or may not be communicant, each of which is provided with its own bottom for unloading purposes. According to another embodiment of the invention illustrated in figures 4, 5 and 6, the air distributor 7 is rotated by means of a motor instead of by the air itself, while conduit 5 for unloading the pulverulent or granular materialcoces out from the bottom of container 1 and in particular from the center of the same, while distributor 7 rotates around inlet end of said conduit.As is shown in detail in figures 5 and 6, likewise to the previously described embodiment of the invention, a discoidal body 8 made up of two superimposed, spaced plates 8a and 8b is provided the upper one 8a makes up the inside of the bottom of container 1, while plate 8b forms the lower outside part of said bottom and is fixed to the side walls of container 1. Plates 8a and 8b are ringshaped and, in particular, plate 8b carries a bracket 101 which is also substantially ring shaped and concentric with plate 8b the internal edge of bracket 101 is joined with the corresponding internal edge of plate 8a, thus defining the inlet end 5a of the discharge conduit 5. A plurality of radial sectors 15 delimit corresponding radial conduits 16 for the air, which are similarly provided between plates 8a and 8b.Bracket 101 holds air distributor 7 which rotates with respect to the first on ball crown 102 and which forms the lower part of chamber 17 w .ere distributor 7 rotates the upper vault of said chamber is constituted by the internal face of the edge of plate 8a that delimits the inlet 5a of conduit 5. On bracket 101 there is also an eccentrically placed inlet 103 which accomodates the compressed air conduit 4 and a housing 104 for the transmission from the motor not shown to the air distributor 7. To this end, the motor rotates a shaft 104, at the end of which a first conical gear 105 is keyed.Gear 105 operatively engages a toothed conical end 106a of a body 106 which rotates on bearings 107 in an opening 108 of bracket 101 the other end of body 106 carries a cylindrical toothing 106b which engages a corresponding cylindrical tocthing formed on the lower part 7a of the distributor 7 which thus may be rotated with respect to bracket 101 on ball crown 102. The upper part 7b of distributor 7 is integral with the lower one by means of a plurality of alternated connecting pins 109 and springs 110 around inlet 5a. One side wall of upper part 7b of distributor 7 is mantained to sliding contact due to the action of springs 110 with an anti friction member 111, made of, for example, teflon, which is provided along the inlet openings of radial conduits 16.On said side wall an opening 21 is provided, which during the rotation of distributor 7 will put into communication, one after the other, each of radial conduits 16 with the compressed air circuit. All of the gaskets and seals between the various fixed and moving parts necessary to prevent air losses, infiltrations of oil and other materials, are foreseen in the device. They are shown quite clearly in figure 6 and are not described in detail. Blockage of the unloading conduit 5 is obtained by means of a sliding gate 112 which is operated by a hydraulic jack not shown or, another, similar, means sliding gate 112 is tight mounted between the beginning of conduit 5 and bracket 101. The distribution of the compressed air into container 1 takes place in an analogous manner as previously described through passages or windows 113 formed on plate 8a, each of which corresponds to a respective radial conduit 16 and is oriented toward the center of container 1.Further variations and modifications can be made to the pneumatic device for unloading pulverulent of granular materials from fixed or mobile containers, as described above and as illustrated without departing from the scope of the invention itself.
