Appropriate methods which may advantageously be employed therefore include, for example, selective crystallization and chromatography separation, e.g., column chromatography. Since the stereochemical configuration is already fixed in the intermediates if , IV , VI and X it is also possible to separate cis and trans forms at this or even an earlier stage, whereupon the corresponding forms of I may be derived therefrom in the previously indicated manner. The separation of cis and trans forms of such intermediates may be performed by conventional methods as described hereabove for the separation of cis and trans forms of the compounds I . It is evident that the cis and trans diastereomeric racemates may be further resolved into their optical isomers, cis , cis , trans and trans by the application of methodologies known to those skilled in the art.

Antifungal and antibacterial compositions comprising an effective amount of an active compound I , either alone or in combination with other active therapeutic ingredients, in admixture with suitable carriers may be readily prepared according to conventional pharmaceutical techniques for the usual routes of administration.Preferred compositions are in dosage unit form, comprising per dosage unit an effective quantity of the active ingredient in admixture with suitable carriers. Although the amount of the active ingredient per unit dosage may vary within rather wide limits, dosage units comprising from about 50 to about 500 mg and more particularly from about 100 to about 250 mg of the active ingredient are preferred. The compounds of formula I , the acid addition salts and stereochemically isomeric forms thereof are also useful agents for aiding regression and palliation of neoplastic diseases in animal and human hosts. Neoplastic disease, as used herein, is meant to include all types of cancerous growths or oncogenic processes, metastatic tissues or malignantly transformed cells, tissues or organs, irrespective of histopathologic type or stage of invasiveness. For example, the subject compounds may be used in accordance with this invention against such neoplastic disorders as Lewis Lung 3 LL tumor and pulmonary metastases, methylcholanthrene induced sarcoma, Moloney leukemia, sarcoma 180, leukemia L 1210 and the like in laboratory animals. A particularly useful test is against lymphoid L 1210 in mice, which has been shown to have the highest predictability value of animal tumor screens for clinical activity against myclocytic leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, carcinoma of the ovary, colon or breast, Wilm s tumor, neuroblastoma and choriocarcinoma see, for example, CancerChemotherapy Reports, Vol. 50, 173 218 1966 . Another useful test is against fibronarcioma MO 4 inmice, which has been shown to be predictive for antineoplastic chemotherapeuthic agents like cyclophosphamide see Merck Index, 7th volume, page 313 , which is an alkylating antineoplastic agent in lymphomas and certain leukemias. Experiment 1 MO4 in vivo screening.MO4 cells are C3H mouse embryonal cells that have been tranformed by the Kirsten strain of murine sarcoma virus. They are routinely subcultered in Eagle s minimal essential medium supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum. For inocculation in inbred C3 H mice the cells are trypsinized and suspended in complete medium. They are spun down 800 rpm , washed once in Eagle s minimal essential medium without serum and diluted in the same medium at a concentration of 5.106cells per ml. C H mice are inoculated with 0.2 ml of the cell suspension 1. 06 cells mouse by intraperitoneal injection. With this cell inoculum the control mice die after 16 20 days with many tumour nodules on the serous membranes all through the peritoneal cavity and with accumulation of ascitic fluid.The test compounds are administered by intraperitoneal injection 40 mg kg . Survival time is recorded and the results are expressed as T c ratios of the medium survival time T treated c control .The T c ratios of a number of compounds are illustrated in column 1 of table II.Experiment 2 L 1210 in vivo screening.L 1210 mouse leukemia cells are transplanted intraperitoneally in DBA2 C3H mice and collected once a week by rincing the peritoneum with sterile saline. The cells are centrifuged, resuspended in Eagle s minimal essential medium without serum and diluted to a concentration of 5 x 106 cells ml. Each mouse DBA2 C3H F1 hybrid receives 0.2 ml cell suspension intraperitoneally or intravenously. The test compounds are administered by intraperitoneal injection 40 mg kg .

The process of this invention comprises systemically administering to subjects hosting neoplastic disease an effective ameliorating amount of a compound of formula I , preferably admixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Such carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, i. e. oral or parenteral. In preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, elixirs and solutions or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral injection, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, to aid solubility may be included.Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form, as used herein, refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such dosage unit forms are tablets, capsules, pills, powder, packets, wafers, teaspoonfuls, tablespoonfuls and the like, and segregated multiples thereof.The amount of active ingredient per dosage unit may range fro m about 5 mg to about 500 mg, and, preferably, from about 10 mg to about 250 mg. The total dosage of the active ingredient for the treatment of the particular neoplastic disease may depend on the species and size of the subject being treated the particular condition and its severity the particular solubility of the active ingredient and the route of administration. In any case the dose to be used is one non toxic to the recipient. As a dosage regimen, the amount of principal active ingredient systemically administered is an effective amount sufficient to aid regression and palliation of the neoplastic disease in the absence of excessive deleterious side effects of a cytotoxic nature to the host harboring the disease. The examples are intended to illustrate but not to limit the scope of the present invention. A.
