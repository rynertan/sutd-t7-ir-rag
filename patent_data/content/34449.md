# Improvements in hydraulic anti skid braking systems for vehicles.

## Abstract
In an anti skid braking system a supply of operating fluid from a master cylinder 16 to vehicle brake is modulated in accordance with skid signals from skid sensing means 6 . The system incorporates an hydraulic pump 3 of the double acting type having a plunger 24 working in a bore 25 and a working chamber 30 which is in communication with a modulator assembly 2 adapted to control brake application following skid correction.
