# Improvements in or relating to the control of fluid pressure circuits.

## Abstract
A control system for controlling the pressure and pressure balance in two separate fluid pressure circuits 2, 8 . A valve 10 being employed which comprises a balance piston 2 and a regulating piston 3 . Each of the pistons controls a connection of the first and second fluid pressure circuits to a respective relief line 15, 20 . Fluid pressure is applied to the regulating piston 3 to regulate the pressure in one circuit 8 and the balance piston regulates the pressure in the other circuit in relation to that regulated by the regulating piston. A three position switch 32 and two air pressure regulators 30, 31 or a three position switch, 5 , two potentiometers PC, PL and a servo control valve 201 control the pressure applied to the regulating piston to control the pressure required in the first and second circuits for the desired modes of operation. A further balance valve 40 may be dis posed between the first and second circuits.
