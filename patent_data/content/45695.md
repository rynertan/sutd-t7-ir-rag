# Two sheet diffusion transfer photographic assemblages.

## Abstract
Two sheet diffusion transfer photographic assemblages are described wherein an overcoat layer is present on the dye image receiving element of such assemblages. The overcoat layer comprises silica in a hydrophilic colloid which prevents spontaneous delamination during the lamination period, yet permits satisfactory peel apart afterwards.
