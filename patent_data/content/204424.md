# Method and apparatus for gas separation.

## Abstract
Feed gas is directed along the non skin surface of gas separation membrane modules 21 comprising a cylindrical bundle of parallel contiguous hollow fibers 11 supported to allow feed gas to flow from an inlet 22 at one end of a cylindrical housing 21 through the bores 12 of the bundled fibers 11 to an outlet 24 at the other end while a component of the feed gas permeates through the fibers 11 , each having the skin side 13 on the outside, through a permeate outlet 26 in the cylindrical casing 21 .
