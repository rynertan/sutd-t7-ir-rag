Verfahren zur Herstellung eines 2 Halogenresorcinols der allgemeinen Formel I

## Description
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of 2 halogenoresorcinols having the following formula I wherein X represents a halogen atom and R and R₁ may be the same or different and represent a hydrogen atom or a halogen atom, or R and R₁ individually or together represent a substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon group or a substituted or unsubstituted hydroxyl, carboxyl, amino, cyano or amido group and esters or ethers of said hydroxyl, carboxyl and amino groups or salts thereof. The halogenoresorcinols of formula I are compounds which in recent years have become industrially important. For example, in US A 4,296,039 it is disclosed that 2 chlororesorcinol and 2 bromoresorcinol can be used to prepare coumarins which are halogenated in position 8 and which may be used for medicinal purposes. The known methods for preparing 2 halogenoresorcinols do not give satisfactory results. In particular, direct halogenation of the resorcinols produces halogen derivative mixtures which are difficult to separate and the transformation of the resorcinols in dihydroresorcinol, followed by halogenation and the elimination of hydrohalogenacids with the formation of halogenoresorcinols, has proved to be difficult to perform on an industrial scale. The present invention is accomplished by providing a process comprising sulfonating resorcinols which do not contain a halogen in position 2 and then halogenating the resulting sulfonic acids. The halogenated sulfonic acids are subsequently protodesulfonated by acid hydrolysis and, if desired, any functional groups which may be present can be modified. In formula I, the halogen atom X may be chlorine, bromine, iodine or fluorine, but is preferably chlorine, bromine or iodine. Examples of ethers of hydroxyl groups are ethers with lower aliphatic alcohols, for instance those with from 1 7 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, n propyl and isopropyl alcohols, the butyl and amyl alcohols, or aromatic alcohols such as benzyl or phenethyl alcohol. Examples of esters of hydroxyl groups are esters with an organic acid having between 1 and 15 carbon atoms, such as lower aliphatic acids with a maximum of 7 carbon atoms, such as formic, acetic and propionic acids, the butyric acids or the bibasic acids, such as succinic and malonic acid or the aromatic acids, such as benzoic acid and its derivatives or sulfonic acids, such as the alkylsulfonic acids with between 1 and 4 carbon atoms or the arylsulfonic monocyclic acids, such as p toluenesulfonic acid. Examples of esterified carboxylic groups are preferably those with lower aliphatic alcohols with between 1 and 7 carbon atoms or with araliphatic alcohols, such as benzylic and phenetylic alcohol. Important are also the nitrile group CN and the amido groups, such as the amido group CONH₂ or amido groups deriving from secondary amines. The amino groups can be the primary amino group NH₂ or a secondary amino group NH R₂ or tertiary group The hydrocarbon groups for R and or R₁ of formula I, and R₂, R₃ and R₄ discussed above, may be aliphatic, aromatic or alicyclic and each of these groups may be substituted by hydrocarbon residues of the other series. These groups may be C₁ ₁₂ alkyl, preferably C₁ ₇ alkyl, or cycloalkyl, particularly C₃ ₇ cycloalkyl residues and may be substituted by one or more groups, for example by 1 to 3 alkyl groups, preferably with a maximum number of 4 carbon atoms, and especially by methyl groups. In the case of R and R₁ jointly representing a hydrocarbon group, it is preferably an alkylene group with, for example, between 1 and 7 carbon atoms. Each of the above mentioned hydrocarbon groups may be substituted by one or more, preferably by between one and three, organic functional groups, for example by one of the functional groups mentioned above. It is especially preferred that the aromatic hydrocarbon groups, such as phenyl groups, may be substituted with one or more halogen atoms, particularly between 1 and 3 halogens. R and or R₁ may also be a halogen atom such as chlorine, bromine, iodine or fluorine. The esters and ethers of the compounds obtainable by the procedure of the present invention of formula I are preferably those deriving from the hydrocarbon groups or from the above mentioned organic acids. The process of the present invention comprises, in the first stage, the sulfonation of a resorcinol of formula II, where R and R₁ have the same significance as in formula I. This sulfonation leads to the resorcinolsulfonic acids IV when R is different from hydrogen and to the resorcinolsulfonic acids of formula III when R is hydrogen. In both cases, R and or R₁ may be modified whenever they represent, in the original compounds, groups which are hydrolyzable in the process of sulfonation, such as acyloxy or acylamine groups. The resorcinolsulfonic acids III or IV are, in the second stage of the process, subsequently halogenated to give the halogenoresorcinol sulfonic acids V or VI, respectively. Finally, in the third stage of the process, the halogenoresorcinol sulfonic acids V or VI are protodesulfonated to give the 2 halogenoresorcinol I. In this process of protodesulfonation, the groups R and or R₁ which are hydrolyzable in acid pH, can be transformed into free functional groups. These various operations and stages of the process of the invention can be carried out in separate stages, separating the intermediate products after each stage, or they can be carried out without interruption and without isolating the intermediates. As noted above, the groups R and or R₁, which may be hydrolyzed in the process of sulfonation or protodesulfonation, are for example acyloxy and acylamine groups. The procedure of the invention is illustrated in the following reaction scheme. The procedure for the preparation of 2 halogenoresorcinols according to the present invention, consists, therefore, in a sulfonating a resorcinol or derivatives thereof of formula II where R and R₁ have the same significance as for formula I b halogenating the sulfonation product thus obtained c protodesulfonating the thus obtained halogenation product and, if desired, functionally modifying free functional groups and or in liberating functional groups from the corresponding modified functional groups, and or in interconverting among themselves, free or modified functional groups, and or in possibly converting an obtained product into one of its salts. Sulfonation, the first stage of the procedure, may be effected by a per se known sulfonation procedure. For instance, the starting compound resorcinol II can be treated with sulfuric acid with a concentration of between about 90 and 98 or with fuming sulfuric acids with a titer of between about 10 to 20 of free SO₃. The reaction should preferably be carried out at a suitable temperature of between about 5 and 100 C. If the starting compound is resorcinol or one of its derivatives with one single substituent R₁ other than hydrogen, the resorcinolsulfonic acid III is obtained. On the other hand, if one of the starting products of formula II is used, in which R alone or both the substituents R and R₁ are other than hydrogen, the sulfonation product corresponding to formula IV described above is formed, bearing in mind that R and or R₁ may be modified as described above, for instance acyloxy or acylamine R and or R₁ groups may be hydrolyzed to hydroxyl or amino groups. If desired, the resorcinolsulfonic acids of formulas III and IV can be isolated by methods which are themselves per se known. For example, the resorcinolsulfonic acids may be isolated in the form of salts, such as the salts with alkaline or alkaline earth metals, such as sodium, potassium or calcium. The salts can be obtained in a manner which is per se known, for example by treating the sulfonation mixture with an aqueous solution of a hydroxide, for example of an alkaline hydroxide. The salts of the resorcinolsulfonic acids may be isolated by a per se known procedure, varying the methods according to the type of acid present and according to the concentration. Many salts, such as the sodium salt of resorcindisulfonic acid or of its derivatives, can, for instance, be isolated by filtration or centrifugation. Most of the resorcinolsulfonic acids of formulas III and IV, namely those in which at least one of the substituents R and R₁ is other than hydrogen, and their salts, such as alkaline salts, for example sodium salts, are new and also form an object of the present invention. The halogenation reaction, the second stage of the procedure according to the invention, may be conducted in a manner which is also per se known and may be effected on the sulfonation mixture obtained in the first stage, and possibly also after dilution with water and or after conversion of the resorcinolsulfonic acids into salts, especially alkaline salts, as described previously. It is also possible, if the halogenation method described below permits, to operate in anhydrous or almost anhydrous conditions, using either free acids or their salts, such as alkaline salts, operating in organic liquids which must be inert towards the reagents used. For the halogenation reaction, all of the halogenating agents of a phenolic aromatic structure, described in literature for halogenation reactions with chlorine, bromine, iodine and fluorine, may be used. In this way, should it prove desirable to introduce into the compounds of formula III and or IV a chlorine or bromine atom, it is possible to use chlorine or bromine as such, operating in acid or basic or neutral conditions. Alternatively, it is possible to cause the formation of chlorine and bromine themselves in the reaction medium in situ , by either 1 using derivatives which easily yield the halogen and are recommended and described in literature for chlorination and bromination, such as sulfuryl chloride or sulfuryl bromide, chloro and bromo amides or imides ether perbromines, such as dioxane perbromine or 2 using an oxidation reduction reaction such as those caused by mixtures of metallic bromines or chlorines such as alkaline metals and of bromates and chlorates of the same metals in acid aqueous conditions. For the introduction of iodine, it is preferable to use compounds which liberate the iodine in situ, for instance mixtures of iodides and iodates in aqueous acid conditions. Fluorination of the compounds of formulas III or IV may be effected, for instance, by treatment with xenon difluoride or perchloryl fluoride ClFO₃ in suitable, preferably anhydrous, conditions. It has been ascertained that, for chlorination and bromination reactions, operating in aqueous conditions, the halogenation reaction unexpectedly gives good results only when the halogens corresponding to chlorine and bromine are generated in situ, that is, in the same reaction medium and especially in the presence of a suitable quantity of corresponding hydrohalogen acids. On the other hand, when the halogens are used as such, by adding them to the reaction medium, halogenation proceeds with the formation of secondary products which lead to a decrease in the yield and difficulties in the purification of the halogenoresorcinol sulfonic acids and also of the final halogenoresorcinols. In order, therefore, to obtain with optimal yield the chlorination or bromination of the resorcinolsulfonic acids of formulas III and IV or of their salts, it is necessary to operate in an aqueous solution using chlorine or bromine generated in situ, starting with the above mentioned reagents, which easily liberate the halogen in the reaction medium or which generate halogen in the reaction medium or which generate halogen by means of an oxidation reduction reaction. In particular, mixtures of diluted hydrochloric acid and an aqueous solution of an alkaline chlorate favor chlorine generation and mixtures of diluted hydrobromic acid and an aqueous solution of an alkaline bromate favor bromine generation. In place of chlorate or bromate, other oxidants such as manganese dioxide can be used. The chlorination and bromination reactions in aqueous solutions are conducted preferably in the presence of considerable quantities of acids, especially the hydrohalogen acid corresponding to halogen. In particular, operations should be carried out in aqueous solutions containing about 8 to 25 , of hydrohalogenacid and the reaction is carried out preferably at a suitable temperature of between about 5 and 10 C. The chlorination and bromination reactions of resorcinolsulfonic acids or their salts, especially the reactions utilizing free halogens, can also be effected in nonaqueous conditions using suitable diluents which do not react with the reagents used in the operative conditions. In this way, for example, it is possible to use nitrobenzene, dimethylformamide, carbon tetrachloride, methylene chloride concentrated sulfuric acid, or mixtures of the same, such as sulfuric acid and nitrobenzene or sulfuric acid, nitrobenzene and methylene chloride. Small quantities of water up to about 8 may also be present in the reaction medium. In order to obtain good yields it is necessary to operate at a temperature of less than 30 C. By using chlorine and bromine as the halogenating agents and diluent mixtures consisting of sulfuric acid and nitrobenzene, the temperature at which the best yields are obtained is between about 5 and 25 C. The mixture obtained from the sulfonation reaction can be directly chlorinated or brominated without isolating the resorcinolsulfonic acids. It is, therefore, sufficient to add a suitable quantity of diluent, such as nitrobenzene, and chlorine or bromine. The halogenated resorcinolsulfonic acids V and VI are themselves novel compounds and also form, together with their salts, a particular object of the present invention. They may be converted into their metallic salts, and in particular into the alkaline metal salts, such as potassium or sodium, or alkaline earth metals, such as calcium, by adding the corresponding hydroxides to the acid aqueous solutions obtained by diluting the mixture obtained from the halogenation reaction with water. In addition, if desired, the salts may be isolated, for example, by crystallization, which can be achieved by concentration of the reaction mixture. Protodesulfonation, the third step of the process of the invention, which causes the transformation of the halogenoresorcinolsulfonic acids V and VI into the 2 halogenoresorcinols I is achieved by the action, on these acids, of aqueous acids, at temperatures which may vary preferably between room temperature and 150 C. Mineral acids are used for this purpose, such as aqueous solutions of sulfuric acid between 20 and 40 or 36 hydrochloric acid, or diluted organic acids, such as halogenated lower aliphatic acids, such as trifluoroacetic or monochloracetic acid or lower aliphatic sulfonic or monocyclic aromatic acids, such as p toluenesulfonic acid, in aqueous solution, for instance at concentrations of between 20 and 90 , or in a suitable solvent, such as aqueous acetic acid 90 . The duration of hydrolysis depends on the temperature and on the acid used and may vary between 1 and 24 hours. The protodesulfonation reaction may be carried out directly on the mixture obtained from the halogenation reaction, without isolating the halogenoresorcinolsulfonic acids, operating at the above mentioned acid concentrations. One particularly advantageous method of effecting protodesulfonation in the procedure of the invention consists of diluting the halogenation mixture with water, in particular of chlorination or bromination, removing any organic solvent which may be present in a per se known manner, and then hydrolyzing the product thus obtained as described previously. The 2 halogenoresorcinols I resulting from the protodesulfonation of the halogenoresorcinolsulfonic acids are usually found in aqueous solutions and may be separated by per se known procedures. In particular, separation may be effected by extraction with organic solvents, such as chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons and especially symmetric dichloroethane and methylene chloride ethers, especially diethyl ether and methyltertiarbutyl ether alcohols which are only slightly soluble in water, such as amyl alcohols esters of aliphatic organic acids, such as ethyl acetate and butyl acetate. The 2 halogenoresorcinols I can be subsequently purified, for example by distillation in vacuum and or converted into their salts, for example into alkaline metal salts, such as potassium or sodium salts which may be isolated in a per se known manner. The product 2 chlororesorcinol is, like resorcinol, extremely soluble in water the solubility of 2 chlororesorcinol at 25 C in water is 350 mg ml . However, unlike resorcinol, 2 chlororesorcinol is not very soluble in acid aqueous solutions, in particular, at room temperature in sulfuric acid solutions of concentrations of between 20 and 60 at higher concentrations partial sulfonation takes place and in concentrated sulfate solutions or other inorganic salts such as the neutral or possibly acid alkali metal , alkali earth metal , magnesium , or ammonium salts of the hydroacids such as hydrochloric , phosphoric , or nitric acid, or organic acids such as aliphatic acids with a maximum of 7 carbon atoms like for example acetic or chloroacetic acid. For example, the solubility of 2 chlororesorcinol in aqueous H₂SO₄ at 25 C H₂SO₄ at 20 is 77 mg ml H₂SO₄ at 30 is 35 mg ml . For this reason, 2 chlororesorcinol can be separated very conveniently by extraction or precipitation by first of all treating its aqueous solutions with acids or salts such as those previously mentioned. This separation of 2 chlororesorcinol, independently from the procedures described previously, also forms one of the objects of the present invention. If the halogenoresorcinols prepared according to the procedure of the present invention contain functional groups, the halogenoresorcinols can be transformed into their derivatives by functional modification by per se known methods, or the functional groups may be liberated in derivatives of this type obtained by the procedure of the invention. In addition, the free or modified functional groups can be transformed one into the other. These reactions can be carried out in a manner which is per se known. In order to modify functional groups present in the above mentioned hydrocarbon groups and or aromatic functional groups R and or R₁ leaving intact the two hydroxyl groups which appear in formula I, it is necessary to choose suitable methods which allow this type of selective conversion. To esterify aliphatic or aromatic carboxylic groups, the acids are converted into their salts, for example into alkaline salts, and halogenated hydrocarbon are reacted on them. The corresponding amides are obtained by treatment of the esters with ammonia or amine. The primary or secondary amino groups can be alkylated by treatment with alkyl halogens or other alkyl esters such as neutral sulfates or alkyl acids, or by reductive alkylation with appropriate aldehydes, such as formaldehyde and formic acid. It is also possible to prepare quaternary ammonium salts. On the other hand, it is possible to liberate, by known methods, functional groups of the products I obtained according to the procedure of the invention, should they in fact contain functional modified groups utilizing known methods. For example, the hydroxyl groups can be obtained by acid hydrolysis of the ether groups or, possibly, also by reductive scission, or by acid or alkaline hydrolysis of the esterified hydroxyl groups. The carboxyl groups can be obtained by alkaline or acid hydrolysis of the esters. The possible conversion of a functional group into another functional group may be effected according to per se known methods. For example, it is possible to transform an aromatic primary amino group into a hydroxyl group or into a halogen by passing through diazonium salts by means of well known reactions of aromatic compound chemistry, or to transform an aliphatic primary amino group into hydroxyl with nitrous acid. The following examples illustrate, in a nonlimiting way, the procedures of the present invention. In one 500 ml round bottom flask containing 156 ml of sulfuric acid at 96 m m and 52.5 g of resorcinol are added. Before the resorcinol completely dissolves, another 156 ml of sulfuric acid at 96 and another 52.5 g of resorcinol are added. The temperature of the mass tends to increase but does not exceed the maximum temperature of 90 . When the temperature is stable or tends to decrease the mass is heated to 110 and this temperature is maintained for two hours. Then the mass is cooled to room temperature. By thin layer chromatography analysis it is possible to determine that in the reaction mixture there is no resorcinol while the main constituent is the resorcinol 4,6 disulphonic acid with only small quantities of resorcinol monosulphonic acid and resorcinol trisulphonic acid. The cellulose thin layer chromatography analysis is done with an eluent mixture formed by isoamylic alcohol, pyridine, water, acetic acid 2 2 1 1 , Rf 0.25 . The separation of the resorcinol 4,6 disulphonic acid can be done by precipitation of the acid from the reaction mixture by adding concentrated hydrochloric acid. The reaction mixture obtained from Example 1 is poured into a two liter round bottom flask containing 472 g of ice and 480 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid at 37 m m . The temperature of the mixture is cooled to 15 C and, slowly, 60 g of potassium chlorate are added this operation should proceed very slow and last 12 hours . The reaction mixture is allowed to reach room temperature and, after ten hours from the end of the addition of the chlorate, a solution formed by 127.5 g of KOH and 127 g of water is added. After twelve hours the suspension which is at room temperature is filtered. The solid remaining on the filter is formed by the potassium salt of the 2 chlororesorcinol 4,6 disulphonic acid 229 g. Cellulose thin layer chromatography, eluent isoamyl alcohol, pyridine, water, acetic acid 2 2 1 1 . Rf 0.46. The potassium salt of the 2 chlororesorcinol 4,6 sulphonic acid 229 g obtained from Example 2 is treated with 1975 ml of water and 427 g of sulfuric acid at 96 m m . The suspension thus obtained is refluxed for 24 hours. By the thin layer chromatography, it is possible to determine in the reaction mixture the presence of small quantities of resorcinol while mainly the 2 chlororesorcinol 86 g is present. The chromatography analysis is done on silica layer by an eluting mixture formed by methylene chloride acetic acid 90 10 . The reaction mixture obtained from Example 3 is treated with 350 g of H₂SO₄ at 96 obtaining in this way a sulfuric acid solution having a concentration of about 30 m m. The solution is brought to room temperature and then extracted with butyl acetate. The butyl acetate solution is evaporated and a residual of 85.5 g of 2 chlororesorcinol is obtained. Crystals from dichloroethane have a melting point of 97 C. The reaction mixture obtained from Example 1 is brought to 15 C and 120 g of chlorine are than added, always maintaining a temperature of 15 C. The mixture is then poured into a 2 liter round bottom flask containing 450 g of ice and 400 ml of water, and to the resulting aqueous phase is firstly added a solution formed by 150 ml of water and 76 g of sodium hydroxide, and then it is refluxed for 24 hours. The solution is brought to room temperature, and after extraction by diethyl ether, ether evaporation and crystallization of the residual from dichloroethane, 88 g of 2 chlororesorcinol M.P. 97 C are obtained. To the reaction mixture obtained from Example 1, 200 ml of nitrobenzene are added and, keeping a constant agitation, the temperature is brought to 60 C. After 15 minutes, the temperature is cooled to 15 C and 120 g of chlorine are added, always maintaining a temperature of 15 C. The reaction mixture is then poured into a separating funnel containing 450 g of ice and 400 ml of water, the organic phase is separated and the aqueous phase is put in a 2 liter round bottom flask. Firstly, to the aqueous phase is added a solution formed by 150 ml of water and 76 g of sodium hydroxide, and then the resulting mixture is refluxed for 24 hours. The solution is then brought to room temperature and, after extraction with diethyl ether, evaporation of the ether and crystallization of the residual from dichloroethane, 93 g of 2 chlororesorcinol M.P. 97 are obtained. To the reaction mixture obtained from Example 1, 200 ml of nitrobenzene are added and, keeping a constant agitation, the temperature is brought to 60 C. After 15 minutes the temperature is cooled to 15 , 50 ml of methylene chloride is then added and, subsequently, 100 g of chlorine is added, always maintaining a temperature of 15 C. The reaction mixture is then poured into a separating funnel containing 450 g of ice and 400 ml of water, the organic phase is separated and the aqueous phase is put into a 2 liter round bottom flask. Firstly, to the aqueous phase is added a solution formed by 150 ml of water and 76 g of sodium hydroxide, and then the resulting mixture is refluxed for 24 hours.
