# METHOD OF DETERMINING IRON, PYRITE, OR ASH CONTENTS OF COAL

## Abstract
A method for determining iron or pyrite or ash content of coal comprises measuring the attenuation or scattering by a coal sample of 14 keV gamma rays from a ⁵⁷Co Mossbauer source in a non magnetic metallic matrix, both with the source at rest or vibrating with a maximum speed of less than 1 mm sec and also with the source vibrating with a peak speed of at least 5 mm sec, and generating respective output signals as a function of said attenuation or scattering.
