## Description
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM UTILIZING A STRETCHABLE TRAIN OF CARS AND STRETCHABLE BANDCONVEYORS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention The present invention relates to conveying devices of which the components are linked together such that the distance between them varies as a function of velocity.Description of the Prior Art A stretchable bandconveyor is a bandconveyor made of a succession of elements sliding into or above each other and linked to each other by devices for varying the distance between them such that the visible length and the speed of the elements vary along their course. A stretchable train of cars is an endless succession of cars linked to each other by devices varying the distance between them. A stretchable and endless train of cars may be used in combination with bandconveyors at loading unloading stations where the speed of the cars and the distance between them is at a minimum and is syn6hro nized over some distance with the speed of the bandconveyors in order to enable people to go from the bandconveyors to the cars and vice versa. Several variable speed bandconveyors are known in the prior art. One such device uses components which are longer than they are wide. These components slide along each other, while the relative direction of motion progressively changes from a direction perpendicular to the long side of the components to a direction parallel to it, and therefore, the speed of the components varies proportionally to the ratio of their length and width.Another example of a rotating type conveying apparatus is illustrated in U.S. Patent 3,485,182. Bandconveyors which operate at constant speeds and which are used to go into or out of cars moving. at the same speed are also known in the art.Usually, those cars are attached to a cable moving at constant speed, and the distance between them is fixed. These prior art devices do not utilize controllable means for coupling the components and or cars to achieve variable speed and variable distance operation while maintaining the components aligned, i.e. unrotated, with respect to a closed loop path followed by the components. Other known systems use means to control the bandconveyors but they are limited to configurations where the elements of the bandconveyors do not slide within one another or where the elements rotate perpendicularly to the direction of movement. For instance, the device disclosed in U.S.Patent 3,881,423 and French Patent 2,345,329 use cables for connecting cars. However, the winding or stretching means of the cables utilize devices such as a take up reel to control the cable lengths and moreover are not applicable to elements of a stretchable bandconveyor where the elements slide within one another. Swiss Patent 397,999 uses articulated rods for connecting elements sliding above each other as opposed to within one another. This limits the device to expansion ratios of no more than 2 to 1 without having the components rotate because of their geometry. U.S. Patent 4,053,044 and 3,834,520 and 3,462,002 are similar to Swiss Patent 397,999 but they use cables instead of articulated rods. Like the device of Swiss 397,999, these devices are not applicable to stretchable conveyors where the elements slide within one another. U.S. Patent No. 4,370,931 hereby incorporated by reference details a transportation using a closed loop path and a mechanism for controlling the speed of the load carrying components and their distance apart.The mechanism moves the load carrying components along a closed loop path without rotation of the components in a direction traversed to the closed loop path. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the invention a transportation system is provided in which a continuous succession of components, cars or bandconveyor elements travel in a closed circuit and are linked to each other by devices which control and permit variations of the distance between them. The cars continuously move, but before each loading unloading station the distance between the cars is progressively reduced to a minimum by the devices linking the cars together or by devices adjacent to the path followed by the cars. After each station, the distance between the cars.is progressively increased by the same linking devices or by similar adjacent devices up to ta maximum distance. The action of increasing or reducing the distance between the cars will automatically increase or reduce the speed of the cars proportionally to the distance between the cars including the car length .Therefore, the speed of the carts is at a minimum at the station. The loading unloading platform at the station consists of a bandconveyor moving at a speed which is synchronied with the minimum speed of the cars. To increase the capacity of the system, without increasing the width of the cars it is necessary to increase their minimum speed or the speed of the bandconveyors. In the latter case a stretchable bandconveyor may be made of elements having linking means permitting the speed of the elements to be progressively increased and decreased as described in relation to the train of cars. The succession of elements are made to slide above or preferably into each other to maintain a solid surface suitable for transport of passengers. Such a stretchable bandconveyor can be used separately or in combination with the trains of cars.

RETAILED DESCRIPTON OF THE PREFERRED MBODIMENTS Figure 1A illustrates a lateral view of a succession of cars 1 moving from the right to the left. Linking devices 2, such as cables winded around winches, interconnect the cars to one another. In the embodiment illustrated, starting from point A on the right, the cables are completely unwound and the distance between the cars and the speed of the cars is a maximum. Between points A andB, the cables are progressively wound and the distance between the cars and therefore their speed is reduced0 A station where the cars are loaded and unloaded is positioned between points B and C. In the station the cables are completely wound up such that the cars are adjacent each other and move at a speed which is synchronized with the speed of a bandconveyor not shown which moves adjacent the cars to enable passengers to go into or get out of the cars. After point C the cables are progressively unwound again and the distance between the cars and therefore their speed is progressively increased. Figure 1B shows the variation of the speed of the cars as a function of their location. Figure 2 shows a horizontal view of two trains of cars 1 going in opposite directions between two bandconveyors 4 which enable passengers to go into or come out of the cars at a station 6. The cars are linked to each other by linking devices 2 such as cables winded around winches not shown . The cars may have sliding doors 8 which are automatically opened and closed at the beginning and the end of the bandconveyors. The bandconveyors may comprise endless belts equipped with hand rails 5 and devices 3 which prevent jamming between the station platform and bandconveyor. Safety rails 7 may also be provided to prevent people from putting their hands between cars or from entering into the station until the distance between cars has been reduced to a minimum The two rows of cars are separated by a wall 9 to prevent the mixing of the two opposite air flows in order to reduce air drag. One mechanism for controlling the speed of and distance between cars which uses articulated rods positioned to articulate between two rails is disclosed in the above referenced U.S. Patent No.4,370,931. Also discussed therein is a mechanism using threaded rods and nuts for controlling the speed of and distance between cars. The present invention is directed to a variable pitch screw rod mechanism and specifically to the mechanism of Figure 3 which illustrates a transportation device made of an endless succession of alternating elements such as 413, 414, 415, which are dimensioned to slide inside of each other. The variable pitch screw rod 120 is preferably positioned adjacent to the path followed by the elements. It should be understood that while the embodiment described utilizes the elements 413, 414, 415 to form an expandable conveyor segment or component, theoretically at least, any number more than two could be used. The innermost element 415 is connected to the outermost adjacent element 413 by articulation member or hinge 416 which enables a succession of elements to move along a closed loop path 417.The elements are provided with retaining means see Figure 4B for preventing them from sliding completely apart from each other, either when the alternating elements are pushed fully within one another or fully stretched apart from each other. All the alternating elements except one, which is preferably either the innermost element i.e., 415 or the outermost element i.e., 413 not visible , have one or more rods 418 fixed at one end to the element. The other end is adapted to slide in grooves 419 of endless screws 420, which as discussed below may have either a variable pitch thread or a constant pitch thread, depending upon its location along the closed loop path 417. Each rod 418 is fixed on its element such that it is at a predetermined distance, i.e. the minimum distance dm or the maximum distance dM, from adjacent rods when the adjacent elements are respectively fully compressed or fully stretched. The pitch of the thread of the endless screws may vary continuously and progressively from a minimum dm to a maximum dM or vice versa, or from some fraction of dm to the same fraction of dM, as described below in connection with Figure 7. The endless screws may be driven by motors or the like 421 such that the sliding of the rods 418 in the grooves 419 operates to drive the attached element at a speed varying from Vm to VM and the distance between two adjacent rods is varying from dm to dM with Vm VM dm dM see Figure 7 . It is important to fully understand the relationship between the elements, e.g., 412 415, the rods, e.g., 418, and the screws 420. Between two consecutive screws 420 the elements are free to slide one within the other and to move freely along the closed loop path 417. However, when the elements are positioned along the screws 420, they are linked to the groove 419 of the screws 420 by the rods 418 associated with the particular elements. Therefore the movements of the elements will depend upon, and will be caused by, the displacement of the grooves 419 due to the rotation of the screw 420. Therefore, the speed of the elements and their distance apart will depend on the thread pitch of the grooves. The elements are connected to each other such that their distance apart can vary between a minimum, dm and a maximum dM when there are no forces acting on them. When the elements are pushed against each other, their distance apart is always the minimum distance sum , which is a predetermined constant distance. When the elements are pulled away from each other, their distance apart is always a maximum distance do , also a predetermined constant distance. Since the rods 418 are positioned at a fixed point on the elements, their distance apart from each other will vary as the elements vary from a minimum distance dm to a maximum distance dM. When any particular element approaches a rotating screw 420 because it is pulled by the preceding element which has already engaged the groove 419 of that screw and which is therefore driven by that screw, the thread pitch of the groove of that screw is such that the speed of the preceding element is constant and equal to the maximum speed VM over a portion of the screw at least equal to dM. The entrance to the groove of a screw 420 is positioned such that the rod 418 associated with a particular element will coincide with the entrance when the associated rod of the preceding element is at a point along the screw located at a distance dM from the entrance to the screw as measured along the axis of the screw.Therefore the succession of rods 418, associated with a succession of elements, will automatically engage the groove 419 as long as they are pulled by the preceding element at a distance dM from the preceding element. Thereafter the pitch of the thread of the screw may vary to reduce the speed of elements and their distance apart. In the case of such a deceleration screw, the thread pitch on the latter part of said screw will be such that the speed of said element is at a minimum Vm and the distance from one element to the preceding element already disengaged from the screw is at a minimum Sm over a distance at least equal to dm. After disengagement from the screw, the succession of elements push each other at the minimum speed vm until they reach the following screw. The distance between their associated consecutive rods is therefore dm The engagement of the rods 418 with the groove 419 of next screw 420 is automatically assured if the thread pitch of the following screw is such that the speed of the preceding element already engaged in the groove of that screw is equal to vm and the entrance of the groove of that screw is positioned such that the rod associated with the element will coincide with the entrance when the associated rod of the preceding element is at a point along the groove of the screw at a distance dm from the entrance to the groove as measured along the axis of the screw. It is important that all the elements between two consecutive screws are always in a condition whereby they are either being pulled or pushed in order to ensure proper engagement between the rods 418 and the grooves 419. Therefore, the number of elements between the screws must be constant. This is easily assured by having the rotational speed of the screws synchronized such that an element 418 leaves a screw simultaneously as a preceding element enters the following screw. Each element may also be equipped with wheels 422. The maximum distance between two consecutive wheels 422 is approximately equal to the length of any particular elements, e.g., 413 514, which is considerably smaller than the maximum distance between two consecutive identical elements, e.g. the outermost elements such as 413 and 413 , when the elements are fully expanded. If elements sliding above one another, as opposed to within each other, are used, all the elements would be identical and their length would therefore equal the maximum distance between the outermost consecutive elements of the sliding arrangement. The distance between the wheels supporting elements which slide above each other is therefore relatively large when the elements are fully expanded.Their structural geometry therefore must be such that they can carry substantially larger loads over their substantially longer span. This increases the inherent rotation of such elements when they slide above one another. It is, therefore, far less practical to use elements which slide above each other than within one another. The top of Figure 3 illustrates an endless succession of hand grips 423 moving above the elements, generally 412, and located within easy reach of a passenger 424 to facilitate his or her transfer from a fixed platform 425 to the element 412, and vice versa and to enable the passengers to maintain their equilibrium on the elements during accelerations, decelerations and travel along the closed loop path. The hand grips are fixed on overhead trolleys or the like 426 moving along rails 427 and connected to each other by cables 428 such that the distance between two adjacent grips is either minimum and proportional to dm or maximum and proportional to dM when the overhead trolleys 426 are either compressed against or pulled apart from each other.The overhead trolleys further include rods 429 which are free to slide along the grooves 430 of endless screws 431 adjacent the rail 427. Each trolley 426 engages the rail 427 by means of upper wheels 450 and lower wheels 451 although it should be understood that either more or less than the four wheels depicted can be used. In lieu of hand grips, other driven safety or comfort devices can be used with the bandconveyor.For instance, a guard rail positioned alongside the bandconveyor or seating means suspended from the overhead rail or other such devices may be used. The screws 431 have variable threads proportional to the threads of the screws 420 and are driven by motors 432 or the like at a speed proportional to the speed of the screws 420, such that the hand grips move at a speed equal to the speed of the element below it along the visible portion of the closed loop path of the element. Figure 4A illustrates a detailed view of the elements 413, 414 and 415, the articulation 416, the thread following rods 418, the variable pitch thread grooves 419 and the wheels 422. The drawing further depicts the teeth 433 or the like of a comblike device and the side 434 of the grooves on the load carrying surface of the top of elements as are more fully described and illustrated hereinafter inFigure 5 . Figure 4B is a cross section of Figure 4A depicting an exemplary retaining device 444, 445 for preventing the components from sliding completely apart from each other. The retaining means includes slots 452 and 453 positioned to accept the slide members 444 and 445, respectively. At each end of the slots 452 and 453 are positioned stops not shown to restrain the movement of slide members 444 and 445 within their respective slots. Thus, the elements 413, 414 and 415 can be compressed and stretched but cannot be stretched apart or pushed one through the other. It should be understood by the artisan that other retaining means can be used and that more or less than three elements can be used to comprise a succession of alternating elements. The teeth 433 and grooves 434 which form the load carrying surface are clearly understood with reference to Figure 4B. Figure 5 illustrates a detailed view of a portion of the surface and understructure of an embodiment having four alternating elements 413, 414, 415 and 415 , connected to the adjacent element 413 by an articulation 416. It should be understood the magnitude of the variations in the dimensions of the surface details of the components has been exaggerated for clarity. Teeth 433 are set either to the outer element 413 or the innermost element, in this case 415 . The teeth 433 slide in slots 435 provided in the load carrying surface of 413, 414 and 415.The slope of the edges 451 of the teeth 433 and the slope of the leading edges 450, 460 and 470 of the carrying surface of 413, 414, 415, respectively, are shallow enough and the width of the slots 435 and the distance between the teeth 433 are small enough to prevent loads or objects of reasonable size from being squeezed between the edges of the elements 413, 414, 415 and the teeth 433 when the elements slide within one another. Figure 5 also illustrates grooves 434 on the top surface of the outermost element 413 to permit the teeth of a comb like device set on the fixed platform 425 Figure 3 to slide within the grooves 434. The width of those grooves 434 and the distance between those grooves are small enough to prevent the trapping of a load or passenger between the top surface of the elements and the teeth of the comb like device on the platform. The teeth 433 engage slots 435 in the assembly of elements 413, 414 and 415 such that, when elements 413, 414 and 415 are compressed together, the grooves 434 of the outermost elements 413 and 413 face each other and therefore make a continuous groove. Figures 6A and 6B illustrate an alternative embodiment of the invention and depict, respectively, a lateral and a cross sectional view of a succession of cars 445 suspended from a monorail 436 and connected to each other by cables 437 and having rods 438 which can slide within grooves 439 made on endless screws 440 having a variable pitch thread. The screws are driven by motors 441 or the like and the thread pitch is designed so that the cars are pulled from one screw the leftmost screw inFigure 14A to the next screw at a constant maximum speed VM or so that the cars 435 are pushed from one screw to the next at a constant minimum speed Vm and that the rightmost screw in Figure 6A will progressively accelerate the cars 445 to a constant maximum speed VM in accordance with the pitch designs illustrated in Figure 7. A bandconveyor 442 may be provided to move along synchronously with the cars, on that portion of the car path where the car speed is at or near a minimum, i.e. at a passenger station, to permit the transfer of passengers 443 from the bandconveyor to the cars and vice versa. It should be understood that the cars 445 of Figure 6A generally correspond to the succession of grips 423 of Figure 3 and that the bandconveyor 442 of Figure 6A may be a succession of elements e.g. 413, 414, 415 as depicted in Figure 3 except that the maximum speed of the elements of the bandconveyor is equal to the minimum speed of the cars and therefore the speed of the elements is equal to the speed of the cars along a portion of the visible part of the closed loop paths of the elements, thereby permitting passenger transfer only along that portion. It should be understood that the relationship between the endless screws driving the bandconveyor and the endless screws driving the cars has to be such that at the location of the transfer portions, the car speed is constant and at its minimum and synchronized to the bandconveyor speed which is at ita maximum. Turning now to Figure 7, there is depicted at the top of the figure, in diagram form, an accelerating screw or threaded rod placed at the end of station 1 which corresponds, for instance, to the rightmost screw in Figure 6A and the development of the pulling screw, decelerating and pushing screw placed at the beginning of the next station station 2 , which may correspond to the leftmost screw inFigure 6A, with associated diagrams of the speed of the cars, and the distances between adjacent cars and adjacent threads. It should be understood that this diagram specifically pertains to the embodiment ofFigures 6A and 6B but the explanation of the threaded rods is also applicable to the embodiment of Figures 3 5. Assume that cars A and B are moving from left to right at a constant speed equal to the minimum speed vm and, therefore, the thread or pitch of the endless screws constant and equal to a minimum Tm.Therefore, we have Tm cotg a m .s D, 1 where alpha m is the angle between the groove and the axis of the screw and D is the diameter of the screw. Vjn 1 1 Tm 2 where X 1 is the rotation speed of the screw expressed in number of revolutions per unit of time. As the car A moves from its illustrated position toward that of car B in Figure 7 at a constant speed vm, the distance between the middle of the car A and the middle of the following car on its left not shown on the figure is constant and equal to a minimum dm which should be a multiple of Tm for example, in this case dm 4 Tm . This is important to assure that the following car will approach the screw in such a way that its rod will exactly engage the groove of the endless screw. In practice, those cars may be one against the other moving along the bandconveyor placed at the station to permit the transfer of passengers from the station to the cars.The length of the cars should be equalsto dm and the width of the groove should be large enough at its entrance to permit small fluctuations of dm or the rods may be fixed to their associated car by a flexible means to allow them some degree of lateral movement. As the screw rotates, the distance di between the car A and the succeeding car B increases, since car B is moving during that same period of time from its position as illustrated inFigure 7 toward the position of car C at an increasing speed vi along the groove which has an increasing thread or pitch Ti which makes a decreasing angle ai with the axis of the screw. vi Vm a ti 3 where a is the desired acceleration and ti is the time taken by the car B to go from B to the point i. For simplicity it is assumed that the desired acceleration is constant. Otherwise equation 3 would be EMI18.1 and all the following equations should be revised accordingly. If xi is the distance from the initial position of car p to i, we have xi vm ti a ti2 2 4 which permits the calculation of ti as a function of the position of i on the screw and therefore of vi.We also have vi 1 D cotg alpha i with 1 , a constant 5 This permits the calculation of i but Ti D cotg alpha i since the development of the groove is a curve and since alpha i is varying. But if i 1 ts the point on the groove to the left of i on the line parallei to the axis of the screw, we have xi 1 Vm , Ti 1 ati 12 2 6 where ti 1 is the time taken by the car B to go from point b to point i 1.The time. of one full revolution of the screw can be calculated as follows ti ti 1 i i 7 The distance along the axis of the screw corresponding to one turn of the screw can be written as xi xi 1 Ti 8 where Ti is the patch of the scrw. In this example, where the screw must make four revolutions to get each car to the position of the preceding car and where i 1, i 2, i 3, and i 4 are the successive points of the groove at the right of i and on the same axis parallel to the axis of the screw, di Ti 1 Ti 2 Ti 3 Ti 4 Xi 4 Xi 9 With those equations it is possible to calculate vi,Ti, ai and di at any point between b and d as shown on the diagram. At the point of d along the screw axis the speed of the car is equal to the maximum speed and the angle between the groove and the axis of the screw is a minimum and equal to alpha M. Assuming the screw does not end at point d, the distance Ti 1 between point d and a following point on the groove to the right of d and on the axis of the screw would be equal to TM and the distance between the car D and the preceding car i.e. to the right of D is equal to 4 TM i.e., the cable is fully stretched and the acceleration screw is no longer necessary . Under these conditions TM Tm. dM dm VM Vm 10 but TD Z Tg as clearly shown in the lefthand graph ofFigure 7. The portion of the accelerating screw between a and b may not always be necessary inasmuch as at station 1 the cars abut against each other and are therefore pushed at a uniform speed vm by a pushing screw located at the beginning of station to the left of A and not shown on the figure . As car D leaves the accelerating screw, it is pulled by the preceding cars which are themselves pulled by the pulling screw located along the car path toward the following station and shown in Figure 7 to the right of the accelerating screw. The forces developed by the pulling screw may be limited to what is necesesary to overcome the energy loss between the two stations due to friction and the like. The thread is constant and the length of the pulling screw must be at least equal to dM in order to always have at least one car pulled by the screw. The car being pulled will in turn pull all the following cars. The distance between a car AA and the car BB is equal to dM and the distance between the car AA and the car D is a multiple of dM. Again it is important that the cars should preferably approach the pulling screw in such a way that their associated rods will properly engage the groove of the pulling screw. This will be automa tically done if the length of the pulling screw is equal or greater than dM and if dM is a multiple of the thread pitch of the pulling screw T M here dM. tT M . Note that in the example dM is equal to the length of the cable plus the length of the car. In practice since the cables are not infinitely rigid, dM can vary slightly and therefore the entrance of the groove at point a must be wide enough to provide for the small variations 6f the distance between the car BB when at b and the car AA at a , since the car AA is pulled by the car BB. The pulling screw can be attached to a decelerating screw, but in the case illustrated the pullingscrew is separate and rotating at twice the speed, Xi of all the other screws in order to keep the angle ai large and therefore the stresses perpendicular to the direction of motion of the cars as small as possible. In this case, we therefore have T M TM 2 11 and cotg a1 cotg aM 2 12 It is also within the scope of the invention to have more pulling screws at different locations between the stations in order to reduce the energy lost from friction or other sources between two pulling screws where the distance between the stations is large.Alternatively, the system may have small motors on each or some cars to offset the frictional and other energy losses. The decelerating screw sould be very close to the last pulling screw, since the car BB should not lose any significant speed between the points b and b and the cables to the left and right of the car BB are already loose since di starts to decrease from point a at a distance SM from b . The decelerating screw is exactly the opposite of the accelerating screw if a corresponding deceleration is desired. Similar mathematical formulas therefore pertain. In the two embodiments discussed above using threaded rods to drive the components, the rods are placed at fixed locations and the cars or handrail trolleys or bandconveyor elements or the like components track the threaded rods. When a small number of fixed rods is used, their size can be quite large, in fact for some applications several hundred feet long. They will obviously have to be supported between their extremities. One relatively easy way to construct such rods is to use steel pipe as the wore . As depicted in Figure 8, a steel core 500 is coaxially disposed within an outer pipe 502 in which a groove following the appropriate thread path and cut to the appropriate width has been formed. The two pipes are rigidly joined by either metallurgical bonding e.g. welding or mechanical bonding e.g. screws . Advantageously, the inner pipe can be filled with some sound deadening material. Alternatively, the inner pipe may be a frame welded or otherwise bonded to the outer pipe. The assembly will then be capable of transmitting forces to the cars from the motors placed at the ends of the pipe. Standard 32 and 36inch still pipes are sufficiently strong for most practical applications. When the distance between stations is large, it is recommended that small motors be provided on some or all the cars to offset the energy losses due to friction and the like in order to maintain a reasonable tension in the cables. These motors are preferably coupled with devices for measuring the tension in the cables pulling the associated cars.Switching devices would also preferably be provided to start the motors automatically when the cable tension exceeds a predetermined stress and to stop the motors automatically when the tension is less than a smaller predetermined stress.
