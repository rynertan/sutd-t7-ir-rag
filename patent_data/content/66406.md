In particular, the invention relates to a class of penicillins having an aminothiazole group in the side chain. The invention also relates to a process for the preparation of such compounds and to pharmaceutical compositions comprising them. According to the present invention there is provided a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or in vivo hydrolysable ester thereof EMI1.1 wherein R1 is hydrogen and R2 is an optionally substituted five or six membered heterocyclic group containing one or two nitrogen heteroatoms or R1 and R2 together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached form an optionally substituted five or six membered heterocyclic group containing one or two nitrogen heteroatoms. The compounds of the present invention include the pharmaceutically acceptable esters of compound I which hydrolyse readily in the human body to produce the parent acid, for example, acyloxyalkyl groups, such as acetoxymethyl, pivaloyloxymethyl, a acetoxyethyl, aacetoxymethyl and a pivaloyloxyethyl groups alkoxycarbonyloxyalkyl groups, such as ethoxycarbonyloxymethyl and a ethoxycarbonyloxyethyl dialkylaminoalkyl groups such as diinethylaminomethyl, dimethylaminoethyl, diethylaminomethyl or diethylaminoethyl and lactone groups such as phthalidyl or dimethoxyphthalidyl. The compounds of the present invention contain both an amino group and a carboxyl group and may, therefore, exist as the zwitterion or may form salts with suitable acids or bases.

The carboxyl group may be regenerated from any of the above esters by usual methods appropriate to the particularRx group, for example, acid and base catalysed hydrolysis, or by enzymically catalysed hydrolysis, or by hydrogenation. A reactive N acylating derivative of the acid III is employed in the above process. The choice of reactive derivative will, of course, be influenced by the chemical nature of the substituents of the acid. Suitable N acylating derivatives include an acid halide, preferably the acid chloride or bromide. Acylation with an acid halide may be affected in the presence of an acid binding agent, for example tertiary amine such as triethylamine or dimethylaniline , an inorganic base such as calcium carbonate or sodium carbonate or an oxirane, which binds hydrogen halide liberated in the acylation reaction.The oxirane is preferably a C1 6 1,2,alkylene oxide such as ethylene oxide or propylene oxide The acylation reaction using an acid halide may be carried out at a temperature in the range 500C to 500C, preferably 200 to 200c, in aqueous or non aqueous media such as aqueous acetone, aqueous tetrahydroform, ethyl acetate, dimethylacetamide, dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, dichloromethane, 1,2 dichloroethane, or mixtures thereof.Alternatively, the reaction may be carried out in an unstable emulsion of water immiscible solvent, especially an aliphatic ester or ketone, such as methyl isobutyl ketone or butyl acetate. The compounds of formula I may also be prepared by reacting a compound of formula V EMI7.1 wherein the amino group is optionally substituted with a group which permits acylation to take place and Rx is as defined with respect to formula II above, with an Nacylating derivative of an acid of formula VI EMI7.2 wherein RÚ and Rê are as defined with respect to formula I and any reactive groups therein may be protected and thereafter, if necessary, carrying out one or more of the following steps i removing any carboxyl blocking group RX ii removing any protecting groups on the side chain group iii converting the product into a salt or in vivo hydrolysable ester thereof. The antibiotic compounds according to the invention may be formulated for administration in any convenient way for use in human or veterinary medicine, by analogy with other antibiotics, and the invention therefore includes within its scope a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula I above together with a pharmaceutical carrier or excipient. The compositions may be formulated for administration by any route, such as oral,topical or parenteral. The compositions may be in the form of tablets, capsules, powders, granules, lozenges, creams or liquid preparations, such as oral or sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions. Tablets and capsules for oral administration may be in unit dose presentation form, and may contain conventional excipients such as binding agents, for example syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth or polyvinylpyrollidone fillers, for example lactose, sugar, maize starch, calcium phosphate, sorbitol or glycine tabletting lubricants, for example magnesium stearate, talc, polyethylene glycol or silica disintegrants, for example potato starch or acceptable wetting agents such as sodium lauryl sulphate. The tablets may be coated according to methods well known in normal pharmaceutical practice. Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of, for example, aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups or elixirs, or may be presented as a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use.Such liquid preparations may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents, for example sorbitol, methyl cellulose, glucose syrup, gelatin, hydroxyethylcellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, aluminium stearate gel or hydrogenated edible fats, emulsifying agents, for example lecithin, sorbitan monooleate, or acacia non aqueous vehicles which may include edible oils , for example almond oil, oily esters such as glycerine, propylene glycol, or ethyl alcohol preservatives, for example methyl or propyl p hydroxybenzoate or sorbic acid, and, if desired, conventional flavouring or colouring agents. Suppositories will contain conventional suppository bases, e.g. cocoa butter or other glyceride. For parenteral administration, fluid unit dosage forms are prepared utilising the compound and a sterile vehicle, water being preferred. The compound, depending on the vehicle and concentration used, can be either suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. In preparing solutions the compound can be dissolved in water for injection and filter sterilised before filling into a suitable vial or ampoule and sealing. Advantageously, agents such as a local anaesthetic, preservative and buffering agents can be dissolved in the vehicle. To enhance the stability, the composition can be frozen after filling into the vial and the water removed under vacuum. The dry lyophilized powder is then sealed in the vial and an accompanying vial of water for injection may be supplied to reconstitute the liquid prior to use.Parenteral suspensions are prepared in substantially the same manner except that the compound is suspended in the vehicle instead of being dissolved and sterilization cannot be accomplished by filtration. The compound can be sterilized by exposure to ethylene oxide before suspending in the sterile vehicle. Advantageously, a surfactant or wetting agent is included in the composition to facilitate uniform distribution of the compound. The compositions may contain from 0.1 by weight, preferably from 10 60 by weight, of the active material, depending on the method of administration. Where the compositions comprise dosage units, each unit will preferably contain from 50 500 mg of the active ingredient.The dosage as employed for adult human treatment will preferably range from 100 to 3000 mg per day, for instance, 1500 mg per day depending on the route and frequency of administration. The compound of formula I may be the sole therapeutic agent in the compositions of the invention or a combination with other antibiotics or with a ss lactamase inhibititor may be employed. Advantageously, the compositions also comprise a compound of formula VII or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof EMI10.1 wherein A is hydroxyl, substituted hydroxyl, thiol, substituted thiol, amino, mono or di hydrocarbylsubstituted amino, or mono or di acylamino.
