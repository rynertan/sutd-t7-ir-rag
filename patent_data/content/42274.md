# FRONT DERAILLEUR

## Abstract
This invention relates to a front derailleur for a cycle for use in switching a drive chain between different ones of a plu rality of front chain wheels by operation of a control wire W connected thereto. The derailleur comprises a base member 1 having a mounting means 2, 3 for securing said base member 1 to the seat tube S with said base member 1 ex tending generally horizontally and radially outwardly of said seat tube S a pair of first and second link members 10, 11 pivotally connected by first and second pivot shafts 12, 13 re spectively, to said base member 1 , and a chain shift means 14 pivotally connected to the link members 10, 11 by third and fourth pivot shafts 15, 16 . Known such derailleurs are rel atively large and generate a considerable air resistance during riding of the cycle. According to this invention the first, second, third and fourth pivot shafts 12, 13, 15, 16 are disposed so as to extend generally vertically in use of the derailleur, said first and second link members 10, 11 being pivotally connected by the first and second pivot shafts 12, 13 at their forward portions and by the third and fourth pivot shafts 15, 16 at their rearward portions so as to extend generally horizontally and longitudi nally of the cycle in use of said derailleur.
