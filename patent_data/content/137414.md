# High speed processing system for computer system.

## Abstract
A computer system performs processings such as inferrence by sequentially executing rules 201 each with its if part 211 stored in a working memory. The computer system comprises a production memory storing rules such as the laws of experience and nature and a working memory storing facts and hypothesis. A possibly executable rule 261 selecting system is for implementing a high speed processing the above computer system the speed being sufficiently high in practical use to such a degree that it can satisfy the strict real time performance such as required in command and control. To this end, the selecting system overcomes abrupt reduction of performance due to the increase of the number of rules or conditions, facts and variables. A high speed processing system for the above computer system has a network structure 106 for storing the interrela tion among the rules the network registers or stores, in searching if parts of then parts 212 of the rules, which rule is fired by the satisfaction of which if part and which if part is newly satisfied or unsatisfied by the execution of the then part. The processing system processes the case where the rules include variables. To this end this processing system groups the if items and then items which may be matched with each other depending on variable values, and takes representatives of the respective grouped items as association items 245 to store the facts by the local parts 243 of the association items.
