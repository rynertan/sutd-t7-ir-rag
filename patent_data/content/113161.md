# Method of fabricating a schottky gate field effect transistor.

## Abstract
A Schottky gate FET is fabricated by forming on a semiconductor substrate 20 first and second stacks 26a, 26b facing each other. Each stack 26a, 26b is constructed by an ohmic electrode 24a, 24b and a spacer film 25a, 25b . On the substrate 20 having stacks 26a, 26b formed thereon an insulation layer is formed and is anisotropically etched in the direction of its thickness until the planar surface portions are exposed. As a result, portions 27a, 27b of the insulation layer remain on opposing side walls of the stacks 26a, 26b . After removing the spacer films 25a, 25b to define stepped portions between each remaining portion 27a, 27b and each electrode 24a, 24b , a layer of a metallic material capable of forming a Schottky barrier with the substrate 20 is formed, The remaining portions 27a, 27b are removed to pattern the metallic material layer, thereby forming a Shottky gate electrode 28 c .
