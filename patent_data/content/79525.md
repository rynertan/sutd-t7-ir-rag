# Endoscope apparatus with electric deflection mechanism.

## Abstract
There is disclosed an endoscope apparatus 10 includ ing an electric deflection mechanism which has an insertion section 23 with a deflection portion 25 to be freely deflected, a control section 11 , electric motors 13, 14 , wire drums 19, 20 and angulation wires 21, 22 . A single deflection control lever 27 is arranged in the control section 11 to arbitrarily deflect a distal end portion 26 in any direction. The motors 13, 14 are properly rotated in the forward or reverse direction in accordance with the manual operation of the deflection control lever 27 , thereby proper ly and very precisely deflecting the deflection portion 25 of the insertion section 23 under the control of the operator through the electric deflection mechanism.
