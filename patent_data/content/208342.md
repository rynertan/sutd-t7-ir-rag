## Description
The invention relates to an office automation system comprising a memory for storing coded information, a printer which can print coded information on a sheet of receiving material fed to the printing station of the printer, at least one command inputting device for inputting control commands for the office automation system, and a control system which in response to a first control command carries out a printing job, which control system during the performance of the printing job draws from the memory the information specified by the first control command and feeds it to the printer for printing. A system of this kind is known from EP A 61 571. The known system comprises a number of word processors connected to a common printer. A printing job can be started from each word processor. If a printing job has to be performed by means of such a system, a number of operations first having to be carried out by the operator at the printer, such as e.g. changing the usual type of paper for a type of paper of a different kind, the operator will first have to carry out these operations and then input the order for carrying out the printing job. If the printer is at some distance from the work station, as is not unusual in extensive office automation systems, the annoying consequence to the operator is that he often has to go from the work station to the printer and back. The object of this invention is to provide an office automation system with greater user friendliness. According to the invention, this object is attained in that an office automation system according to the preamble is provided with detection means for detecting a specific event caused by the operator with the printer, in that the detection means in response to a second control command added to a first control command detect whether the event determined by the second control command takes place and, after detecting the said event, send a detection signal to the control system, and in that the control system in response to the second control command postpones the start of the performance of the printing job until the detection signal has been received. In a variant of the invention, which is characterised in that the printer is provided with an inputting device for inputting a code by the operator, and in that the detection means in response to the said second control command detect whether an input code corresponds to the required code and, the detection means upon conformity between the compared codes, offer the detection signal, the operator can easily cancel postponing the start of the printing job after the necessary operations have been carried out. This variant too offers the opportunity of printing being held up, in the case of printing very confidential information, until an authorized person is present at the printer and has input the said code. In such situations, the code to be input will generally be a secret identity code. An attractive variant of the invention is characterised in that the printer is provided with a display means for displaying a message, and in that the printer is provided with means which display a message determined by a said second control command in the event of the control device waiting for the said detection signal prior to starting the printing job determined by the first control command. The invention and other advantages thereof will be explained in detail hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawing. The drawing represents an embodiment of the office automation system according to the invention. The office automation system comprises a number of work stations 1 coupled via a central control station 2 to a common printer 3. Work station 1 is one of a conventional type, such as e.g. a word processor, provided with a keyboard 4 and a screen 5. Keyboard 4 can be used to input the edit texts and for inputting control commands for the office automation system. The input or edited text can be displayed on the screen. The central control station 2 comprises a memory 6 in which the input text information is stored. Central control station 2 is connected via a data transmission channel 7 to printer 3. Printer 3 is a laser printer of conventional type comprising a control panel 8, a laser print module 9, an automatic feeder 10, a semi automatic feeder 11 and a delivery tray 12. Control panel 8 is provided with pushbuttons 13 for manually inputting codes, and with a display means 14 on which messages can be displayed. By means of the automatic feeder 10 it is possible to feed sheets of receiving material from a storage magazine 15 to the laser print module 9. Sheets of receiving material fed manually to the input slot 16 can be introduced by means of the semi automatic feeder 11. Information fed to the printer via the data transmission channel 7 is printed in laser print module 9 on a sheed fed via the automatic feeder 10 or the semi automatic feeder 11. After the information has been printed in the laser print module 9 on a fed sheet the printed sheet is deposited in the tray 12. If a user of the office automation system wishes to print part of the text information stored in memory 6, he can introduce an input command to start a printing job via keyboard 4 of work station 1. The latter transmits the input command to central control station 2, which then creates a printing job for sending the text information specified by the said input command from memory 6. The newly created printing job is put into a queue of printing jobs which have already been created but not yet finished. The central control station 2 calculates a first time required by the printer to perform the newly created printing job and sends this information to the work station 1. Moreover the expected total time needed for printing out all the printing jobs in the queue is calculated and this total time second time is also sent to the work station 1 in question. By displaying these times on the screen of the work station, and, moreover, having the second time counted back to zero with a real clock, the operator always knows when his new printing job can be performed. By inputting more successive printing jobs the work station 1 displays for every job the calculated times together with a job dedicated running indicator. The central control station 2 processes the printing jobs in the queue in order. As soon as the printer has completed printing the information offered by a preceding job, the next printing job in the queue is started. After the printing job has been started, the central control station 2 draws the text information for printing from memory 6 and transmits it via data transmission channel 7 to printer 3, in which the information is printed on the sheetlike receiving material offered to the laser print module 9 via one of the feeders. The above is a description of the printing process for printing jobs initiated by a standard input command. In the office automation system according to the invention, a plurality of commands to control the performance of the printing job can be added to the standard input commands for starting printing jobs. A command of this kind may, for example, indicate that the paper in magazine 15 must be changed before starting the printing job. Another command, for example, may indicate that the information must be printed on a sheet of receiving material input via the semi automatic feeder 11. Yet another command, for example, may indicate that the printing job may not be started until a certain identity code has been input via the keys 13 on the control panel 8. The identity code may be added to the command. Changing the paper in the magazine 15 may, for example, be necessary if the information to be printed is to reproduced on a type of paper differing from a standard type, e.g. if it is required to print on a different colour paper, or if a form is to be used which has a preprinted section. If, when a print order is input, a command has been given to understand that a print must be printed on sheets fed via the semi automatic paper feeder 11, as soon as this print job has reached the head of the queue, a message will be sent to the work station 1 and the print job will again be put at the back of the queue unless the operator has responded to this message within the predetermined time. If the response has been made at the proper time a message is fed by the central control station 2 to the printer 3 and this message is displayed on display means 14. This message indicates that a sheet of receiving material must be introduced into the machine via the entry slot 16 of the semi automatic paper feeder. Also, the message indicates that the operator must show by pressing a predetermined key 13 that the printing job may be started. As soon as the operator has pressed the correct key 13 and a detector 17 has detected the presence of a sheet in the semi automatic paper feeder, printer 3 sends an answer back to central control station 2. If central control station 2 receives the answer back within a predetermined time after the message has been sent, the printing job is started and the information to be printed on the first sheet will be fed to the printer 3 for printing. If the answer back is not received by control station 2 within the predetermined time, the job in question is again put at the back of the queue. If the command added to the input printing order indicates that confidential information is involved, then as soon as the printing job in question reached the head of the queue a message is sent to the work station 1 at which the relevant order has been input. This message is reproduced on the screen 5 of this work station. If this work station operator responds to this message within a predetermined period, e.g. 30 seconds, and inputs an answer back command via the keyboard 4 of this work station, a message will then be transmitted to printer 3 to show that an identity code input is required. The operator of the printer 3 then has the opportunity to input the identity code within a predetermined time via the keys 13 of the control panel. As soon as the correct code has been input, a message is fed to control station 2 which in response thereto starts to perform the printing job in question.
