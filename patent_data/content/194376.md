# A CLUTCH RELEASE ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
The assembly has a cylindrical housing 23 provided with an annular end wall 22 engaged with, or mounted on, the flange 18 of a bearing carrier 12 . A non revolving race 20 of the bearing 12 is engaged against the housing end wall such as to permit lateral displacement of the race relative to the housing end wall. A revolving race 25 of the bearing supports an annular adapter 30 having an outward ly extending flange 32 engaged with the release fingers 34 of the clutch mechanism. The housing is closed by an annular end cap 35 having a flange 41 radially extending between the end face of the revolving race and the adapter flange and provided with a seal 44 having its lip engaged with the revolving race end face or with the back surface of the adapter flange. A second annular seal 60 is preferably provided between the end of the adapter opposite to the flange 32 and a surface 21 of the housing end wall 22 . The seals permit rotary motion between the bearing ele ments and transverse motion such as to allow the bearing to self align within the housing. A Belleville spring 38 is disposed within the housing such as to bias the non revolving race end face into engagement with the housing end wall 22 , with a force sufficient to hold the surfaces in engagement but insufficient to prevent lateral motion of the non revolving race relative to the housing.
