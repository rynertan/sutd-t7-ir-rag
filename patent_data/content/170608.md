Patent No. 4,227,631, entitled Valve for a Spray Container, issued toHilmar Schneider on October 24, 1980, teaches a valve for an aerosol spray container which has a mixing chamber for mixing a gas propellant with an active ingredient in order to produce a finely atomized spray. The gas propellant enters into the valve housing by means of sufficient clearance between the walls of the valve body and the valve housing.

These channels combine in a second mixing chamber resulting in still further atomization of the spray and more efficient utilization of substantially the entire container content.
