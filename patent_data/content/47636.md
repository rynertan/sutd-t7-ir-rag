# Rotary dryer.

## Abstract
A rotary dryer 10 is provided with interacting heat transfer stator 14 and rotor 16 for improved processing capability. The stator 14 comprises a stationary row of planar heat exchange banks 64 supported within the vessel 12 of the dryer 10 . The rotor 16 has a complemental number of annular heat exchange vanes 38 interleaved between the heat exchange banks 64 of the stator 14 to create desired low level agitation of the processed material as the rotor 16 turns and to provide increased heat transfer efficiency. The vanes 38 on the rotor 16 and the banks 64 of the stator 14 each comprise an open grillwork of tubular members 44, 66 whereby the processed material may flow freely through the vanes 38 and banks 64 between an inlet 26 and an outlet 28 for additionally increased heat transfer efficiency and reduced residence time for the material.
