# Highly absorbent resin.

## Abstract
A highly absorbent resin which is essentially a polyamine crosslinked, partial neutralization product ob tained by reaction of an alkali metal hydroxide with a carboxyl containing polymer selected from the group consisting of alpha olefin maleic anhydride copolymers, vinyl compound maleic anhydride copolymers, polyacry lic acid, polymethacrylic acid, and mixtures thereof, the degree of neutralization of the said neutralization pro duct being 0.4 to 0.8 equivalent of total carboxyl groups of the said carboxyl containing polymer, the amount of polyamine as a crosslinking agent being not more than 2 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the neutrali zation product on the uncrosslinked basis, the resin being capable of absorbing at least 20 times its own weight of distilled water. The resin has good resistance to heat and good durability in the hydrous condition.
