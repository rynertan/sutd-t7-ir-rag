# A nuclear reactor control rod having a reduced worth tip.

## Abstract
A control rod with a reduced worth tip is provided for a nuclear reactor which includes an elongated tubular cladding with its opposite ends closed and having a lower end portion with pellets of a neutron absorbing material, such as B₄C, and of an inert material, such as ZrO₂ alternately disposed therein, so as to gradually reduce the rate of change of the neutron flux experienced at the rod s lower end portion as it moves in and out of the fuel assembly thereby to alleviate pellet clad interac tion and reduce the likelihood of fuel rod failure.
