## Description
BENZOTHIOPHENE COMPOUNDS AND PROCESS FOR PREPARING THEM This invention relates to the field of biochemistry, and provides pharmaceutical agents which are antiestrogens and antiandrogens. The invention provides novel 6 hydroxy 2 4 hydroxyphenyl 3 4 2 piperidino or 3 methylpyr rolidino ethoxy benzoyl benzo b thiophene compounds of the formulaEMI1.1 physiologically acceptable esters and ethers thereof, and physiologically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds or of the ethers or esters thereof, wherein R is CH2CH2CH2 or CH CH3 CH2 . More particularly, the invention provides novel compounds of the formulaEMI1.2 wherein R is CH2CH2CH2 or CH CH3 CH R1 and R2 independently are hydrogen, COR or R 3 R is hydrogen, C1 C14 alkyl, C1 C3 chloro alkyl, C1 C3 fluoroalkyl, C5 C7 cycloalkyl, C1 C4 alkoxy, phenyl, or phenyl mono or disubstituted withC1 C4 alkyl, C1 C4 alkoxy, hydroxy, nitro, chloro, fluoro or tri chloro or fluoro methyl and R4is C1 C4 alkyl, C5 C7 cycloalkyl or benzyl and the physiologically acceptable acid addition salts thereof. The invention also provides a preferred process for preparing a dihydroxy compound of the formulaEMI2.1 or a physiologically acceptable ether or ester thereof, or a physiologically acceptable acid addition salt of the dihydroxy compound or of the ether or ester thereof wherein R is CH2CH2CH2 or CH CH3 CH2 which comprises the steps of a acylating a protected starting compound of the formula EMI3.1 wherein R5 is CE3, COR6, or SO2R6 and R6 is C1 C4 primary or secondary alkyl, trifluoromethyl, trichloromethyl, phenyl, p tolyl, p anisyl, or mono or di halo or nitro phenyl under Friedel Crafts conditions with an acylating agent of the formulaEMI3.2 wherein R7 is chloro, bromo, iodo, or an activating ester group R8 is X, 3 methylpyrrolidino, or piperidino and X is chloro, bromo, or SO2R6 8. b when R is X, displacing X with a secon dary amine selected from the group consisting of 3methylpyrrolidine and piperidine c when R5 is SO2R6, cleaving the R5 groups to obtain a dihydroxy product of formula I d when R5 is CH3 or COR6, optionally cleaving one of the R5 groups of the product to obtain a monohydroxy product e optionally alkylating the monohydroxy product of step d to obtain a monoether product also having one remaining R5 group f optionally cleaving the remaining R5 group of the product of step e to provide a monohydroxy, monoether product g when R5 is CE3 or COR6 optionally cleaving both R5 groups of the product of step a or b to provide a dihydroxy compound of formula I h optionally reacylating the product of step c or g to obtain a diester or monoester product. The general chemical terms used in the formulae above have their usual meanings. For example, the terms C1 C14 alkyl, C1 C4 alkoxy and C1 C4 alkyl include groups such as methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, butyl, s butyl, tetradecyl, undecyl, neopentyl, 2,2 dimethylhexyl, 3 ethylnonyl, 3 butylheptyl, dodecyl, methoxy, propoxy and i butoxy. The terms C1 C3 chloroalkyl and C1 C3 fluoroalkyl include methyl, ethyl, propyl and isopropyl substituted to any desired degree with chlorine or fluorine atoms, from one atom to full substitution.The term C5 C7 cycloalkyl includes cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl and cycloheptyl. Estradiol is transported throughout the body in the bloodstream and passively enters cells. However, only certain tissues exhibit responses to the hormone and are accordingly designated target tissues. These target tissues are characterized by specific estrogen receptors. The interaction of estradiol with estrogen receptors is an early event in a complex series of events which result in an estrogenic response. The uterus is considered the primary target tissue for estrogen. It is rich in estrogen receptors and exhibits dramatic growth under the influence of estradiol.Consequently the uterotropic response of rodents pro vides a reproducible model for the evaluation of estrogenic and antiestrogenic activity as well as the study of interactions with estrogen receptors. A relationship has been established between estrogen sensitivity or dependency and the occurrence of estrogen receptors in certain mammary cancers as well as in benign fibrocystic disease of the breast.The neutralization of estrogen influence on those tissues is expected to benefit patients with those conditions by causing regression or preventing recurrence of the condition. Antiestrogens antagonize the action of estrogens in animal models and display clinical efficacy in most mammary cancers which contain estrogen receptors.They interact with estrogen receptors, and elicit partial estrogenic response. Thus, the ability to antagonize the effect of estradiol is related to and restricted by the degree of intrinsic estrogenicity of the compound. The compound that evokes the greatest degree of estrogen antagonism, accordingly, is expected to be the most beneficial. Similarly, androgen circulates and is taken up by androgen receptive tissues. Prostatic cancer is a clinical condition believed to have androgen dependency or sensitivity, as does the condition known as benign prostatic hypertrophy. Accordingly, antiandrogens are in demand, and anti androgenic testing is successfully carried out based on the rapid growth of the rodent prostate under the influence of androgen. Antiestrogens have been under investigation for some years, and at least one such compound is presently being sold for palliative cancer therapy.This drug is tamoxifen, l 4 6 dimethyaminoethoxy phenyl 1,2 diphenylbut 1 ene. Another group of known antiestrogens are the dihydronaphthalenes of U.S. Patent 4,230,862, of Suarez and Jones. The most important compound of this group is trioxifene mesylate, 2 4 2 pyrrolidinoethoxy benzOyl 1 4 methoxyphenyl 3,4 dihydronaphthalene, methanesulfonic acid salt, which has been clinically tested in cases of advanced breast cancer. Another group of antiestrogens are the benzothiophenes of Jones and Suarez, U.S. Patent 4,133,814.Tests of one of their compounds, 6 hydroxy 2 4hydroxyphenyl 3 4 2 pyrrolidinoethoxy benzoyl benzo blthiophene, have. been published by Black andGoode, Life Sciences 26, 1453 58 1980 . The same article also discussed similar tests of tamoxif en and trioxifene as estrogens and antiestrogens. The authors concluded that the above benzothiophene was considerably more effective as an antiestrogen, and considerably less estrogenic, than either tamoxif en or trioxifene. The compounds of the present are antiestrogens and antiandrogens, and are used as pharmaceuticals for antiestrogen and antiandrogen therapy, especially in the treatment of mammary and pro static tumors and in the treatment and prophylaxis of mammary and pro static fibrocystic disease. This invention provides two benzothiophene compounds and the physiologically acceptable esters and ethers which are formed on one or both of the hydroxy groups of the compounds. The invention also provides physiologically acceptable salts of the compounds in any of their forms. Pharmaceutical chemists will easily recognize that physiologicallyactive compounds which have accessible hydroxy groups are frequently administered in the form of physiologically acceptable esters or ethers. The literature concerning such compounds, such as estradiol, provides a great number of instances of such esters and ethers. The compounds of this invention are no exception in this respect, but can be effectively administered as ethers or esters, formed on either one or both of the hydroxy groups, just as one skilled in pharmaceutical chemistry would expect. While the mechanism has not yet been investigated, it is believed that ethers and esters are metabolically cleaved in the body, and that the actual drug, when such a form is administered, is the dihydroxy compound itself.It is possible, as has long been known in pharmaceutical chemistry, to adjust the rate or duration of action of the compound by appropriate choices of ester or ether groups. For example, the cycloalkyl ethers are known to increase the duration of action of many hydroxygroup bearing physiologically active compounds. The physiologically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of this invention may be formed of the dihydroxy compounds themselves, or of any of their esters or ethers, and include the physiologically acceptable salts which are often used in pharmaceutical chemistry. For example, salts may be formed with inorganic or organic acids such as hydrobromic acid, hydriodic acid, sulfonic acids including such agents as naphthalenesulfonic, methanesulfonic and toluenesulfonic acids, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, tartaric acid, pyrosulfuric acid, metaphosphoric acid, succinic acid,.formic acid, phthalic acid, lactic acid and the like, most preferably with hydrochloric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, maleic acid, acetic acid and propionic acid.It is usually preferred to administer a compound of this invention in the form of an acid addition salt, as is customary in the administration of pharmaceuticals bearing a basic group. A group of representative compounds according to the invention will be mentioned by name, to assure that the reader of this document fully understands the compounds. 6 hydroxy 2 4 hydroxyphenyl 3 4 2

The preferred compounds of this invention are 6 hydroxy 2 4 hydroxyphenyl 3 4 2 3 methylpyrrolidino ethoxy benzoyl benzo b thiophene and its physiologically acceptable salts, especially the hydrochloride.Other preferred. compounds include 6 acetoxy 2 4 acetoxy phenyl 3 f4 2 3 methylpyrrolidino ethoxy benzOyll benzo b thiophene, 6 ethoxycarbonyloxy 2 4 ethoxy carbonylOxyphenyl 3 4 2 3 methylpyrrolidino3ethOxy benzoyl benzo b thiophene, 6 benzoyloxy 2 4 benzoyloxy phenyl 3 4 2 3 methylpyrrolidino ethoxy benzOyl benzo b thiophene and 6 methoxy 2 4 methoxyphenyl 3 4 2 3 methylpyrrolidino ethoxy benzoyl benzo b thiophene, 6 hydroxy 2 4 hydroxyphenyl 3 4 2 piperidinoethoxy benzoyl benzo b thiophene and its physiologically acceptable salts, especially the hydrochloride. Other preferred compounds include 6 acetoxy 2 4 acetoxy phenyl 3 4 2 piperidinoethoxy benzoyl benzo b3 thiophene, 6 ethoxycarbonyloxy 2 4 ethoxycarbonyloxy phenyl 3 4 2 piperidinoethoxy benzoyllbenzorblthiophene, 6 benzoyloxy 2 4 benzoyloxyphenyl 3 4 2 piperidinoethoxy benzoyl benzo b thiophene and 6 methoxy 2 4 methoxyphenyl 3 4 2 piperidinoethoxy benzoyl benzo b thiophene, and their physiologically acceptable salts, especially the hydrochlorides. The effect of the compounds of this invention is described as alleviating the pathologicai conditions, to indicate that complete cure of the conditions cannot always be expected, but that use of an effective dose of the compounds will benefit the subject by causing at least some regression of the condition. When the compounds areused preventively, as in a subject who has suffered from an occurrence of mammary fibrocystic disease and is at risk of further occurrences, the compounds will preven.t such occurrences or, at least, lessen or delay the severity of their effects. Use in human subjects is preferred. The compounds of this invention are improved antiestrogens, compared to earlier compounds, because they have a higher ability to inhibit estrogenic response and have less inherent estrogenicity than the earlier compounds. The compounds of this invention, accordingly, give a greater antiestrogenic effect for a given dose of compound, inhibit more effectively at the optimum dose, and contribute less incidental estrogenic response than any prior known antiestrogen. Their antiandrogenic properties, combined with their antiestrogenic properties, make the compounds of this invention still more unique. It is believed that the present compounds are relatively quite free of a histological side effect com mon to earlier anti estrogens. Tamoxifen, for example, causes abnormal growth of uterine epithelial cells.Preliminary studies indicate that the present compounds either cause no abnormality of epithelial cells of the uterus, or cause only extremely slight abnormal growth. The exact mechanism of an antiestrogen, in treating mammary cancer is not known It is believed, however, that the antiestrogen, circulating in the body, competes with endogenous estrogens for estrogen receptor sites in the cancer. To be effective, the antiestrogen must find and bind to receptor sites, and prevent estradiol from occupying them Clearly, if the antiestrogen has inherent estrogenicity of its own, it is likely to enable the cancer to grow just as if the cancer had absorbed endogenous estrogen, The biological tests reported above show the low estrogenicity, high antiestrogenicity and strong affinity for estrogen receptor sites of the compounds of this invention. Accordingly, a most important embodiment of the present invention is a method of alleviating mammary cancers which comprises administering a compound of this invention at an effective rate to a patient suffering from or at risk of such a cancer. The antiestrogens of this invention are believed to have other biological effects as well.Antiestrogens play a role in the treatment of fibrocystic disease of the mammary glands, which role is as yet less well defined than is their use in the treatment of mammary cancers. It is believed, however, that fibrocystic disease, which manifests itself in benign lumps or growths in mammary tissue, is estrogendependent. It has been established that the administration of antiestrogens to patients who have or who have shown a tendency toward fibrocystic disease can alleviate it by both causing the regression of the symptoms of it, and preventing its recurrence. Accordingly, the administration of a compound of this invention to a patient having or at risk of fibrocystic disease to alleviate the disease, is an important embodi ment of the invention. Further, the tests presented above illustrate that the compounds of this invention have an important antiandrogenic effect on the prostate gland Benign prostatic hypertrophy is a very common and distressing condition, manifested by abnormal growth of the prostate gland. An effective drug for the control of this condition has long been sought. The tests reported above show that compounds of this invention have a strong effect on androgen stimulation and maintenance of the size of the prostate gland. Accordingly, it is expected that the compounds of this invention can be administered to males suffering from or at risk of benign prostatic hypertrophy to alleviate the condition.The method of alleviating benign pro static hypertrophy by administering an effective dose of a compound of this invention is, accordingly, an important embodiment of the invention.. Similarly, use of anti androgens in patients suffering from prostatic cancer is known to interrupt the progression of the cancer, because prostatic cancer is dependent upon androgen for its growth, and the anti androgenic compounds of this invention interrupt the course of the disease by preventing the cancer from utilizing endogenous androgen in the patient s system.The exact mode of action of the compounds as antiandrogens has not been elucidated, but the in vivo tests reported above show clearly that the compounds are, indeed, anti androgens. Accordingly, the use of the compounds of this invention to alleviate pro static cancer is another important embodiment. of the invention. The tests which have been applied to a representative compound of this invention were carried out in standard laboratory animals, as described above.The tests which have been applied to the compounds are believed to be clearly predictive of beneficial effects in humans, based on the effects in laboratory animals. The dose of a compound of this invention to be administered to a human is rather widely variable.It should be noted that it may be necessary to adjust the dose of a compound when it is administered in the form of a salt, such as a laurate, the salt forming moiety of which has an appreciable molecular weight.The general range of effective administration rates of the compounds is from about 0.05 mg. kg. day to about 50 mg. kg. day. A preferred rate range is from about 0.1 mg. kg. day to about 10 mg. kg. day, and the most highly preferred range is from about 0.1 mg. kg. day to about 5 mg. kg. day. Of course, it is often practical to administer the daily dose of a compound. in portions, at various hours of the day. The route of administration of the compounds of this invention is not critical. The compounds are known to be absorbed from the alimentary tract, and so it is usually preferred to administer a compound orally for reasons of convenience. However, the compounds may equally effectively be administered percutaneously, or as suppositories for.absorption by the rectum, if desired in a given instance. The compounds of this invention are usually administered as pharmaceutical compositions which are important and novel embodiments of the invention because of the presence of the compounds. All of the usual types of compositions may be used, including tablets, chewable tablets, capsules, solutions, parenteral solutions, troches, suppositories and suspensions.Compositions are formulated to contain a daily dose, or a convenient fraction of a daily dose, in a dosage unit, which may be a single tablet or capsule or a convenient volume of a liquid. In general, compositions contain from about 0.000006 to about 60 of compound, depending on the desired dose and the type of composition to be used. The activity of the compounds does not depend on the compositions in which they are administered or on the concentration. of the composition. Thus, the compositions are chosen and formulated solely for convenience and economy. Any of the compounds may be readily formulated as tablets, capsules and the like it is preferable to prepare solutions from water soluble salts, such as the hydrochloride salt. In general, all of the compositions are prepared according to methods usual in pharmaceutical chemistry. Some discussion will be provided, followed by a group of typical formulations. Capsules are prepared by mixing the compound with a suitable diluent and filling the proper amount of the mixture in capsules. The usual diluents include inert powdered substances such as starch of many different kinds, powdered cellulose, especially crystalline and microcrystalline cellulose, sugars such as fructose, mannitol and sucrose, grain flours and similar edible powders. Tablets are prepared by direct compression, by wet granulation, or by dry granulation. Their formulations usually incorporate diluents, binders, lubricants and disintegrators as well as the compound.Typical diluents include, for example, various types of starch, lactose, mannitol, kaolin, calcium phosphate or sulfate, inorganic salts such as sodium chloride and powdered sugar. Powdered cellulose derivatives are also useful. Typical tablet binders are substances such as starch, gelatin and sugars such as lactose, fructose, glucose and the like.. Natural and synthetic gums are also convenient, including acacia, alginates, methylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone and the like.Polyethylene glycol, ethylcellulose and waxes can also serve as binders. A lubricant is necessary in a tablet formulation to prevent the tablet and punches from sticking in the die. The lubricant is chosen from such slippery solids. as talc, magnesium and calcium stearate, stearic acid and hydrogenated vegetable oils. Tablet disintegrators are substances which swell when wetted to break up the tablet and release the compound. They include starches, clays, celluloses, algins and gums. More particularly, corn and potato starches, methylcellulose, agar, bentonite, wood cellulose, powdered natural sponge, cation exchange resins, alginic acid, quar gum, citrus pulp and carboxymethylcellulose, for example, may be used, as well as sodium laurel sulfate. Tablets are often coated with sugar as a flavor and sealant, or with film forming protecting agents to modify the dissolution properties of the tablet. The compounds may a lso be formulated as chewable tablets, by using large amounts of pleasant tasting substances such as mannitol in the fonnulation, as is now well established in the art. When it is desired to administer a compound as a suppository, the typical bases may be used Cocoa butter is a traditional suppository base, which may be modified by addition of waxes to raise its melting point slightly. Water miscible suppository bases com prising, particularly, polyethylene glycols of various molecular weights are in wide use. The effect of the compounds may be delayed or prolonged by proper formulation. For example, a slowlysoluble pellet of the compound may be prepared and incorporated in a tablet or capsule. The technique may be improved by making pellets of several different dissolution rates and filling capsules with a mixture of the pellets. Tablets or capsules may be coated with a film which resists dissolution for a predictable period of time. Even pareneral preparations may be made long acting, by dissolving or suspending the compound in oily or emulsified vehicles which allow it to disperse only slowly into the serum. The following typical formulae are provided further to assis.t the formulations chemist.

The starting compound is protected, acylated and deprotected to form the desired dihydroxy compound.Biologically active ethers and esters may then be formed if desired. Other variations of the process are also conveniently used and will be explained below. Protection The first step in the usual synthesis is to protect the hydroxy groups, as indicated below.EMI31.1 wherein R5 is R4, COR6 or SO2R6 R4 is C1 C4 alkyl,C5 C7 cycloalkyl, or benzyl and R is C1 C4 primary or secondary alkyl, C1 C3 fluoroalkyl, C1 C3 chloroalkyl,C1 C4 alkylphenyl, C1 C4 alkoxyphenyl, mono or dinitrophenyl or mono or di chloro or fluoro phenyl. Alternatively, the 2 phenylbenzothiophene may be formed with R4 protecting groups in place on the compound as it is synthesized, as discussed further below. The R4 groups are then kept in place on the compound throughout the process. The COR6 and SO2R6 groups are placed on the dihydroxy compound according to methods known in the art. For example , when a COR6 group is desired, the dihydroxy compound is reacted with an acylating agent such an an acyl chloride, bromide, cyanide or azide, or with an appropriate anhydride or mixed anhydride. The reactions are conveniently carried out in a basic solvent such as pyridine, lutidine, quinoline or isoquinoline, or in a tertiary amine solvent such as triethyl amine, tributylamine, methy lp iper idine or the like.The reaction may also be carried out in an inert solvent such as ethyl acetate, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, dioxane, dimethoxyethane, acetonitrile, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone or the like, to which at least one equivalent of an acid scavenger, such as a tertiary amine, has been added. Acylation catalysts such as 4 dimethylaminopyridine or 4 pyrrolidinopyridine may be used, if desired. See, in general,Haslam, Tetrahedron 36, 2409 33 1980 .The acylation reactions which provide COR5 groups are carred out at moderate temperatures in the range of from 250C. to 100aC, Such acylations of the hydroxy groups may also be performed by acid catalyzed reactions of the appropriate carboxylic acids, in inert organic solvents or neat Acid catalysts such as sulfuric acid, polyphosphoric acid, methanesulfonic acid and the like are used. The COR6 groups may also be provided by forming an active ester of the appropriate acid, such as the esters formed by such known reagents as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, acylimidazoles, nitrophenols, pentachlorophenol, N hydroxysuccinimide and l hydroxybenzo triazole. See, for example, Bul. Chem. Soc. Japan 38, 1979 1965 , and Chem. Ber., 788 and 2024 1970 . Other techniques are also known, such as by means of mixed anhydrides of the phosphorus compounds,Shioiri and Hamada, J. Org. Chem. 43, 3631 32 1978 the use of 2 haloheterocyclic compounds such as 2chloropyridine, Narasaka et al., Chem. Let., 763 66 1977 and the use of thiol esters. All of the above techniques of acylations which provide COR6 groups are carried out in solvents as discussed above. Those techniques which do not produce an acid product in the course of the reaction, of course, do not call for an acid scavenger in the reaction mixture. Still other acylation methods are also use 6 ful, such as the use of an R6 substituted ketene in an inert solvent, as discussed above, at a low temperature in the range of 300C. to 250C. Still further, the dihydroxy compound can be first converted to its dianion by treatment with a very strong base such as sodium hydroxide, sodium methoxide, potassium hydride, sodium hydride, n butyllithium or the like, in order to obtain more complete reaction with the reagents which have been mentioned above. Acylation by the dianion technique is carried out in an inert solvent as described above, with no additional base or catalyst. The temperature of reactions according to the dianion technique is from 300C. to 500C. When When a SO2R protected compound is desired, the dihydroxy starting compound is reacted with, for example, a derivative of the appropriate sulfonic acid, such as a sulfonyl chloride, bromide or sulfonyl ammonium salt, as taught by King and Manoir, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 97, 2566 67 1975 . The dihydroxy compound can also be reacted with the appropriate sulfonic anhydride. Such reactions are carried out under conditions such as were explained above in the discussion of reactions with acyl halides and the like. The SO2R6 groups may also be provided by reaction of the dihydroxy compound with an appropriately substituted sulfene under conditions as discussed above for reactions with substituted ketenes. Still further, any of the sulfonate producing reactions may be carried out on a dihydroxy compound in the dianion form, as discussed above. It should be noted that the R4 and COR6 groups used as protecting groups are within the scope of preferred biologically active groups, as discussed above, and thus it is entirely practical to use a given group as a protecting group in the synthesis, and to keep it in place on the product as an active ether or ester. Acylation The protected starting compound is acylated as the second step in the usual synthesis. The acylation can be done either with an acylating agent already containing the 3 methylpyrrolidinoethoxy group o f the desired product, or with a precursor of it, as shown below. EMI35.1 wherein X is bromo, chloro, iodo or OSO2R6. The acylating agents are discussed in detail below. The acylating agent of reaction B is made by known procedures. For example, 3 methylpyrrolidine may be prepared by reduction of 3 methylsuccinimide, and reacted with ethylene oxide to obtain l hydroxy 2 3methylpyrrolidino ethane. That compound is reacted with thionyl chloride to prepare the l chloro counterpart, which is reacted with an ester of 4 hydroxy benzoic acid to prepare the ester form of the acylating agent of reaction B. The ester is hydrolyzed to the acid, and chlorinated or otherwise converted to an active form. It is obvious that this general scheme may be varied, as by changing the order of the steps, to prepare the desired acylating agent. The acylation of reactions B and C is aFriedel Crafts acylation, and is carried out in the usual way. Either a Lewis acid or a proton acid may be used as the Friedel Crafts catalyst an excellent discussion of such catalysts appears in Olah, FriedelCrafts and Related Reactions, Interscience Publ., NewYork, London and Sidney, 1963, vol. I, Ch. III and IV. As explained bsr Olah, the classical FriedelCrafts catalysts were Lewis acids. Such metal halides as aluminum chloride, aluminum bromide, zinc chloride, boron trifluoride, boron trichloride, boron tribromide, titanium tetrachloride, titanium tetrabromide, stannic chloride, stannic bromide, bismuth trichloride and ferric chloride are well known catalysts and are useful in this acylation, especially for acylations of reaction B. The proton acid catalysts are also useful for this acylation, especially for acylations of reaction C, and include such substances as phosphoric acid, polyphosphoric acid, perchloric acid, chlorosulfonic acid, alkylsulfonic acids such as methanesulfonic and ethanesulfonic acids, toluenesulfonic and benzenesulfonic acids, sulfuric acid, chloroacetic acid and trifluoroacetic acid. It is preferred to carry out the acylation with aluminum chloride or trifluoromethanesulfonic acid. The acylation is ordinarily carried out in a solvent, and any inert organic solvent which is not significantly attacked by the conditions may be used.For example, halogenated. solvents such as dichloromethane, 1,2 dichloroethane, chloroform and the like may be used, as can aromatics such as benzene, chlorobenzene and the like, alkanes such as petroleum ether, hexane and the like, and nitrohydrocarbons such as nitrobenzene and nitroalkanes. It has been found that toluene is rather easily acylated under the conditions used in theFriedel Crafts acylation step, and so it is important, when toluene is used in an earlier step of the process, to remove it as completely as possible from the protected starting compound, to avoid wasting the acylating agent. The acylations may be carried out at temperatures from about the ambient temperature to about 1000C., preferably at the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture for processes catalyzed with the preferred proton acid, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, and preferably at about ambient temperature for Lewis acid catalyzed processes. The acylating agent used in the acylations B and C is an active form of the appropriate benzoic acid, wherein R7 is one of the recognized active groups, such as a chlorine atom, a bromine atom, or an activating ester. Appropriate activating esters are formed, as is well known, with hydroxybenzotriazole, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and the like. The group R7 may also indicate an anhydride, especially a mixed anhydride such as those formed with small carboxylic acids such as acetic acid, formic acid and especially sulfonic acids. It is preferred, when the basic side chain is added according to reaction B above, to use as the acylating agent a small excess 1.05 1.5 molar of the proper benzoyl halide, and to use, as the FriedelCrafts catalyst, a slight molar excess of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, or, alternatively, fluorosulfonic acid, p toluenesulfonic acid, a dihalophosphoric acid or concentrated sulfuric acid. Alternatively, the reaction is also carried out in a preferred manner by using a substantial excess 1.5 to 3.5 molar of the benzoyl halide in the presence of a large excess 2 12 molar of aluminum chloride other Lewis acid catalysts, such as aluminum bromide and the like may also be used. In the case of acylations according to reaction C above, it is preferred to carry out the acylation in the presence of a strong acid such as was discussed immediately above. In this reaction, a full equivalent of acid is not necessary a catalytic amount of acid is adequate. It is preferred to carry out the acylation steps in an inert halogenated solvent such as chloroform, dichloromethane, benzene, 1,2 dichloroethane and the like. In general, see as to such acylation reactions an article by Effenberger, Angew. Chem.Int. Ed. Engl. 19, 151 230, especially 163 65 1980 . Displacement When the starting compound is acylated according to reaction C above, the 3 methylpyrrolidino orpiperidino group of the product is subsequently put in place by displacing the X group with 3 methylpyrrolidine or piperidine. The X groups are leaving groups, which are easily displaced by the amine according to known methods. For example, the displacement is carried out in an inert solvent such as ketones in the nature of acetone or methyl ethyl ketone, esters such as ethyl acetate and propyl formate, alcohols such as methanol or ethanol, nitriles such as acetonitrile, or amides such as dimethylacetamide and dimethylformamide, or in such inert solvents as hexamethylphosphoramide, and in the presence of an acid scavenger such as alkalimetal carbonates and bicarbonates and the like. At least an equimolar quantity of acid scavenger is needed, and preferably a moderate excess. The displacement is carried out at ambient temperature, or may be carried out at moderately elevated temperatures from about ambient temperature to the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture. More preferably, the displacement may be carried out in the additional presence of a catalytic amount of iodide ion, which acts as a catalyst for the displacement. When iodide is used in the mixture, the temperature range is lower, from about OOC. to, preferably, the ambient temperature, although elevated temperatures are possible in some instances. Further, the anion of 3 methylpyrrolidine or of piperidine may be formed before the reaction is carried out, as by contact with a very strong base such as sodium hydride or an alkyllithium compound. The use of an anion does nototherwise change the manner in which the displacement is carried out, except that an acid scavenger is not needed. Deprotection When a dihydroxy compound of this invention, of formula I above, is needed, it is obtained by cleaving the protecting groups, R5, from the acylated compounds. Deprotection is carried out after displacement, when the 2 step acylation displacement route is used. Both acyl and sulfonyl protected compounds have been deprotected by simple hydrolysis with strong or moderately strong bases. For example, bases such as alkali metal hydroxides may be used for the hydrolysis, at temperatures from about the ambient temperature to about 1000C, At least two equivalents of base are needed, of course Such hydrolyses are conveniently carried out in hydroxylic solvents, especially aqueous alkanols.The reactions may be also carried out, however, in any convenient solvent which lends itself to hydrolysis reactions, such as polyols including ethylene glycol, ethers such as tetrahydrofuran and the like, ketones such as acetone and methyl ethyl ketone and other polar water miscible solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide. A preferred solvent system is a mixture of methanol and tetrahydrofuran, at ambient temperature.The cleavage may also be carried out with other bases, including, for example, sodium methoxide, potassium t butoxide, hydrazine, hydroxylamine, ammonia, alkali metal amides and secondary amines such as diethylamine and the like. In some instances, when very strong bases are used, reaction temperatures in the range of from about 0oC. to the ambient temperature will give adequately rapid reaction rates. The hydrolysis step lends itself well to reaction with the base in a 2 phase system with the assistance of a phase transfer catalyst. Such catalysts are now well known and are found among the tetraalkyl ammonium halides and among the crown ethers, such as dicyclohexyl 18 crown 6 ether. In the case of compounds protected with COR6 groups, hydrolysis is readily carried out with acid catalysts, such as methanesulfonic acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, a mixture of hydrobromic acid acetic acid, or with acidic ion exchange resins. Such acid catalyzed hydrolyses are carried out in hydroxylic solvents, such as water, alkanols, aqueous alkanols, or a mixture of tetrahydrofuran methanol. It is preferred to carry out such hydrolyses at about the reflux temperature of the mixture, but, when particularly strong acids are used, temperatures as low as the ambient temperature are efficient. A partially hydrolyzed compound is often desired, where only one of the hydroxy groups is deprotected. Such compounds may be prepared by any of the hydrolytic methods described above, by limiting the amount of base or the time of the reaction, or by lowering the temperature, so as to obtain less than complete hydrolysis. Such procedure usually produces a mixture of partially hydrolyzed compounds, which are separated by chromatography. Basic hydrolysis in a primary or secondary alcohol solvent produces a relatively small amount of a mixture of compounds wherein one of the hydroxy groups has been hydrolyzed, and the other has been converted to an alkyl ether where the alkyl group is derived from the alcohol solvent. The major product of the reaction is the dihydroxy compound. Such monoethers are com pounds of this invention, wherein one of R1 and R2 is 4 hydrogen and the other is an R4 alkyl group derived from the alcohol. When the starting compound was protected with R4 alkyl, cycloalkyl or benzyl groups, the protecting groups may be removed by known ether cleavage methods, most preferably in the presence of ethanethiol and aluminum chloride, as explained below in detail. It has been found that the steps of dis 5 placement and cleavage of the protecting groups, R can be combined to produce the dihydroxy compound in one step from an intermediate having a leaving group, X, on the side chain. The intermediate having the X group on the side chain is dissolved in a solvent which is suitable for processing at high temperature. Di methylformamide is a particularly suitable solvent, as also is dimethylacetamide. Other solvents can be used as well, such as high molecular weight alkanes and halogenated alkanes having high boiling points. The intermediate is dissolved in the solvent, and 3 methyl pyrrolidine or piperidine is added, preferably with a catalytic. amount of an iodide salt or a phase transfer catalyst to assist in the displacement reaction.The reaction mixture is stirred for a short time, such as a few hours, which serves to. displace X, and the mixture is then heated to an elevated temperature in the range of about l000 l500C., with appropriate stirring, and preferably under an inert gas atmosphere. The R5 protecting groups then hydrolyze to produce the desired dihydroxy compound in a single step. Ethers and Esters When it is desired to prepare a compound of this invention wherein one or both of R1 and Rê is an ether group, the ether is prepared by placing the R4 moiety on one or both of the hydroxy groups in a manner commonly used for the preparation of ethers. For example, the R4 group may be added by reaction with an appropriate diazo compound, such as diazomethane, phenyldiazomethane or trimethylsilyldiazomethane seeHashimoto et al., Tet. Let., 4619 22 1980 . Such reactions are effectively carried out in solvents including esters such as ethyl acetate, halogenated solvents including dichloromethane and chloroform, and ethers including diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran.Methanol or boron trifluoride is used as a catalyst, and the process is usually carried out at low temperatures from about 450C. to about 0 C. Alternatively, alkylations may be carried out with the assistance of reagents such as trimethyloxosulfonium hydroxide, trimethylsulfonium hydroxide and trimethylselenonium hydroxide all of which provide methyl groups , as taught by Yamauchi, Tet. Let., 1787 90 1979 . Alkylations with these reagents are carried out in solvents which are conducive to SN2 displacements such as dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylformamide, hexamethylphosphoramide, acetone, acetonitrile and the like, usually at elevated temperatures from about 400C. to about the reflux temperature of the mixture. Such alkylations may neatly be used to provide a mono ether product, wherein one of R1 and Rê is an R4 alkyl group, by partially hydrolyzing the inter mediate product r so that one of the R5 protecting groups is left in place, alkylating, and completing the hydrolysis to remove the remaining R5 group. It is preferable, however, to prepare monoethers by using an ultimate starting compound in the mono ether form, and using the ether group as a protecting group through the synthesis, protecting the other hydroxy with an acyl or sulfonyl group. When a compound is desired wherein one or both of R1 and R2 are COR3, it may often be most convenient to prepare the compound using an R5 protecting group other than the desired COR group, hydrolyze off the protecting group, and re acylate one or both of the hydroxy groups at the end of the synthesis. Such acylations are carried out as described above in the discussion of COR5 groups as protecting groups. A particularly preferred condition for final acylations is to use tetrahydrofuran as the solvent and potassium carbonate as the acid scavenger for acylating agents such as acetic anhydride, benzyl chloride, ethyl chioroformate and the like.Another preferred reaction condition for very reactive acylating reagents such as trifluoroacetic anhydride is to use an equivalent of the corresponding acid trifluoroacetic acid in the above instance in tetrahydrofuran at about ambient temperature, and to add the acylating agent as the last addition to the reaction mixture. Methyl Protected Route A particularly preferred route for preparing the dihydroxy compound of this invention is performed by preparing a dimethyl protected benzothiophene starting compound, and acylating with the basic side chain according to a variation of reaction scheme B above. The methoxy groups are preferably cleaved with ethanethiol to prepare the dihydroxy compound in good yield, and without isolation of any of the intermediate products. The methyl protected starting compound is most easily obtained by a synthesis which is exemplified below in the first part of Preparation 1. The process is carried out by reacting 3 methoxybenzenethiol and bromo 4 methoxyacetophenone in the presence of a strong base at a relatively low temperature, to form a J methoxyphenylthio 4 methoxyacetophenone, which is then ring closed with an agent such as polyphosphoric acid at a high temperature to obtain the desired starting compound. The acylation is a Friedel Crafts acylation, and is carried out in the usual way, using aluminum chloride or bromide, preferably the chloride, as the acylation catalyst. The acylation is ordinarily carried out in a solvent, and any inert organic solvent which is not significantly attacked by the conditions may be used.For example, halogenated solvents such as dichloromethane, 1,2 dichloroethane, chloroform and the like may be used, as can aromatics such as benzene, chlorobenzene and the like. It is preferred to use a halogenated solvent, especially dichloromethane. The acylations may be carried out at temperatures from about 300C. to about 1000C.,, preferably at about ambient temperature, in the range of about 150C. to about 300C. The acylating agents an active form of the appropriate benzoic acid, wherein R7 is a chlorine or bromine atom. The preferred acylating agent is that wherein R7 is chloro. The acyl chloride used as an acylating agent may be prepared from the corresponding carboxylic acid by reaction with a typical chlorinating agent such as thionyl chloride. Care must be taken to remove any excess chlorinating agent from the acyl chloride, however. Most conveniently, the acyl chloride is formed in situ, and the excess chlorinating agent is distilled off under vacuum. The stoichiometric amounts of the benzothiophene and the acylating agent may be used effectively.If desired, a small excess of either reactant may be added to assure that the other is fully consumed. It is preferred to use a large excess of the acylation catalyst, such as about 2 12 moles per mole of product, preferably about 5 10 moles. The acylation is rapid. Economically brief reaction times such as from about 15 minutes to a few hours provide high yields of the acylated intermediate.Longer reaction times may be used if desired but are not usually advantageous. As usual, the use of lower reaction temperatures calls for relatively long times. The acylation step is ended, and the demethylation step begun, by adding to the reaction mixture a sulfur compound chosen from methionine and compounds of the formula R9 S R10, wherein R9 is hydrogen or unbranched C1 C4 alkyl, and 10 is C1 C4 alkyl or phenyl. The sulfur compounds are, most preferably, the alkyithiols, such as methanethiol, ethanethiol, the preferred agent, isopropanethiol, butanethiol and the like dialkyl sulfides, such as diethyl sulfide, butyl s butyl sulfide, ethyl propyl sulfide, butyl isopropyl sulfide, dimethyl sulfide, methyl ethyl sulfide and the like benznethiol methionine and alkyl phenyl sulfides such as methyl phenyl sulfide, ethyl phenyl sulfide, butyl phenyl sulfide and the like. It has been found that the demethylation goes best when a substantial excess amount of the sulfur compound is used, in the range of from about 4 to about 10 moles per mole of the starting benzothiophene. The process can be carried out, although less efficiently,.with a smaller amount of the sulfur compound in the range of about 2 or 3 moles per mole of starting compound. It is also possible to use a small amount of the sulfur compound, such as 2 or 3 moles per mole of starting compound, and to improve the yield by the addition of about I to 3 moles of an alkali metal halide, such as sodium, potassium or lithium chloride, iodide or bromide. A similar effect of sodium iodide is shown by Niwa et al., Tet. Let. 22, 4239 40 1981 . The demethylation reaction goes well at about ambient temperature, in the range of from about 150C. to about 300C., and such operation is preferred.However, the demethylation step may be carried out at temperatures in the range of from about 300C. to about 500C. if it is desired to do so. Short reaction times in the range of about 1 hour have been found to be adequate. After the product has been demethylated, it is recovered and isolated by conventional means. It is customary to add water to decompose the complex of the acylation catalyst addition of dilute aqueous acid is advantageous. The product precipitates in many instances, or may be extracted with an organic solvent according to conventional methods. The compounds of this invention, as discussed above, dre very often administered in the form of acid addition salts. The salts are conveniently formed, as is usual in organic chemistry, by reacting the compound of this invention with a suitable acid, such as have been described above. The salts are quickly formed in high yields at moderate temperatures, and often are prepared by merely isolating the compound from a suitable acidic wash as the final step of the synthesis.The salt forming acid is dissolved in an appropriate organic solvent, or aqueous organic solvent, such as an alkanol, ketone or ester. On the other hand, if the compound of this invention is desired in the free base form, it is isolated from a basic final wash step, according to the usual practice. A preferred technique for preparing hydrochlorides is to dissolve the free base in a suitable solvent and dry the solution thoroughly, as over molecular sieves, before bubbling hydrogen chloride gas through it. All of the above reaction steps give acceptable yields when the stoichiometric amounts of the reactants are used, except as noted in certain specific steps above. As is normally the case in organic chemistry, improved yields are given by the use of an excess amount of one of the reactants, and it is practical to use an excess amount of the cheaper or the more easily obtained reactant. For example, in the formation of the protected starting compounds, it is practical and economical to use an excess of the acylating or sulfonating agent, to assure complete reaction of the more expensive dihydroxy starting compound. Excesses in the range of from about 1 toabout 25 are conveniently used, when an excess of one reactant is desired.

The following reports of biological tests illustrate the usefulness of the compounds of this invention. The compound used in many of the tests reported below was the dihydroxy compound, 6 hydroxy 2 4 hydroxyphenyl 3 4 2 piperidinoethoxy benzoyli ben20 b3thiophene. The first test reported below is used to determine the estrogenic potency of compounds It is well known that many compounds having antiestrogenic activity also, typically, have estrogenic activity. As has been explained, estrogenic activity is a liability in an antiestrogen, and thus it is important to identify antiestrogens having a. minimum amount of estrogenic activity. Test 1 Estrogenic Response Test This test was conducted with immature 40 45 g.female rats, immature 11 13 g. mice, and adult ovariectomized mice. The rats were tested in groups of six, and mice in groups of ten. All of the laboratory animals were from standardized strains and were equilibrated to the laboratory before the test started.Each test was begun by administering the test compound daily for three days, as a subcutaneous injection or by oral gavage, as indicated below in the reports of individual experiments. Untreated control animals were included in each experiment, along with animals to which estradiol was administered subcutaneously. The estradiol treated animals provided positive controls, showing the physiological effect of a potent estrogen on the individual group of animals used in the experiment The usual dose of estradiol was 0.1 mcg. day, which dose approximates the physiological level. The test animals were treated for three days and sacrificed on the fourth day, and the uteri were removed, freed of extraneous tissue, and blotted with paper towels. The uteri were weighed to the nearest 0.1 mg. The tables below report the results of representative experiments. The doses of estradiol and of the compound of this invention are given as the total of the three daily doses. The uterine weights are given, in mg., as the means of all of the organ weights of the animals in a group. Compounds are referred to by their example numbers above.

One group of compound treated animals was given estradiol at 0.1 mcg. day for three days, and was given 0.1 mcg. of estradiol and 1 mg. of the compound of this invention on the fourth day. The animals were sacrificed on the fifth day and their mean uterine weight was 56.4 mg. Another group of treated animals was given 0.1 mcg. of estradiol per day for three days and was given 0.1 mcg. of estradiol and 1 mg. of the compound of this invention on each of the following three days.The animals were sacrificed on the seventh day and their mean uterine weight was 57.0 mg. A final group of compound treated animals was given 0.1 mcg. of estradiol on each of three days, and was then given 0.1 mcg. of estradiol and 1 mg. of the compound of this invention on each of the following five days. They were sacrificed on the ninth day and their mean uterine weight was found to be 50.7 mg. Another group of control animals was sacrificed on the ninth day of this experiment, since the animals had been growing through the long period of the experiment, and their mean uterine weight was found to be 31.1 mg. The results of the experiments reported in this test clearly show that the compounds of this invention are capable of reversing an established estrogenic response when the compounds are administered after the response is established. Additional experiments have been done to determine the ability of the compounds of this invention to bind to the estrogen receptor, and their rate of dissociation from the receptor, relative to the rate of dissociation of estradiol. Test 4 Relative Binding Affinity Tests A group of immature 40 45 g. female laboratory rats of a standardized strain were sacrificed, and their uteri were promptly removed and dissected free of adhering fat and other extraneous tissue. The uteri, which were constantly kept cold, were homogenized in a buffer which contained lOmM tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane, hydrochloride, and 1.5mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid at pH 7.4, at a concentration of 1 uterus ml. The homogenate was then centrifuged for one hour at 100,000 x G at 40C., and the supernatant, containing the cytosol fraction, was retained. One half ml. of the cytosol preparation was added to each of a group of tubes which contained l0nM of 2,4,6,7 3H estradiol, or the labeled estradiol plus log concentrations from 10 to 1000 nM of unlabeled competitor which could be the compound to be tested, that of Example 4, or additional, unlabeled, estradiol. All assays were performed in duplicate, and all assays in a given experimental group were carried out on aliquots from the same pool of cytosol preparation. Samples were then mixed and incubated at specified temperatures Each incubation was ended at the specified time by cooling the sample and adding 0.5 ml. of a dextran coated charcoal suspension contain ing 10ia4 tris tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane, hydrochloride, lmM of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 1 of charcoal and 0.18 of dextran at pH 8. The samples were agitated frequently for fifteen minutes at 40C., and then centrifuged at 800 x G at the same temperature for fifteen minutes. The supernatant from the centrifugation contained the cytosol preparation, free of unbound estradiol and estradiol competitors, which were adsorbed by the charcoal. Each one half ml. aliquot of supernatant was transferred to a 20 ml. vial of scintillation solution, and DPM was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The difference between total DPM in control samples containing only labeled estradiol, and that observed in the presence of 1000 nM of unlabeled estradiol was considered to be specific binding. The concentration of unlabeled estradiol on the inhibition curve which corresponded to 50 inhibition of specific binding was determined, as was the concentration on the inhibition curve of the compound of this invention which corresponded to 50 inhibition of specific binding. Relative binding affinity RBA was calculated as the concentration of estradiol which gave 50 inhibition, divided by the concentration of the test compound which gave 50 inhibition. Experiments were carried out at 4 , 150 and 300C., and for periods of one half hour, one hour and 24 hours in various tests. The table below lists the relative binding affinities which were found in a number of experiments, carried out as described above, at the various conditions listed in the headings of the table.

The compounds of this invention have also been tested to determine the facility with which they dissociate from the estrogen receptor. Test 5 Dissociation Tests A cytosol preparation was made as described in Test 4, but at a concentration of 2 uteri per ml.One half ml. aliquots of the cytosol preparation were incubated for one hour at 40C. with 2,000 nM of the compound of Example 4, or of unlabeled estradiol.After one hour, 0.5 ml. of dextran coated charcoal suspension was added, the samples were agitated frequently for fifteen minutes, and were then centrifuged at 800 x G at 40C. for fifteen minutes to remove unbound molecules. One half ml. aliquots of the treated cytosol preparation were then transferred to two sets of tubes, one containing 10 nM of labeled estradiol and the other containing 1,000 nM of unlabeled estradiol as well as 10 nM of labeled estradiol. Two sets of samples were run for each condition. The samples wer then incubated at specified temperatures and times, and were terminated at the end of the designated times by cooling them in an ice bath and adding 0.5 mi. of the dextran coated charcoal suspension to each. The samples were agitated and centrifuged, and 0.5 ml. of supernatant from each was added to scintillation fluid for determination of DPM as described under Test 4. The DPM observed in samples containing 1,000 nM of unlabeled estradiol was subtracted from the readings for corresponding samples with labeled estradiol only, to determine specific binding for each condition.The percent difference in specifically bound DPM between the cytosol exposed to the compound of this invention, or of unlabeled estradiol, and unexposed controls, at each time point was determined and expressed as relative percent bound for the compound and for estradiol.

The effect of a representative compound of this invention against mammary tumors in the rathas been determined in tests carried out as follows. Test 6 Tests Against DMBA Induced Tumors Mammary tumors were induced in adult female virgin rats by a single 20 mg. oral dose of 7,12 dimethylbenzanthracene. Within about six weeks, visible and palpable tumors were present in the mammary tissue of the rats, and the rats were allocated into treatment and control groups in such a way that each group contained animals having approximately the same size and number of tumors. The size of the tumors was estimated by measuring their cross sectional area. At the end of the test, the animals were ovariectomized, all treatments were stopped, and the animals were observed to determine if the tumors regressed, due to the lack of estrogen in the system.Most of the DMBA induced tumors evidently were estrogendependent, because most of them immediately regressed upon ovariectomy. Exceptions, where the tumors did not regress after ovariectomy, are foot noted in the reports of individual experiments below. Experiment A In this experiment, 6 hydroxy 2 4 hydroxy phenyl 3 4 2 piperidinoethoxy benzoyl benzoEb thio phene was administered orally to each animal for eight weeks. In the first two week period, the animals were given 0.1 mg. kg. day, which dose was increased to 5, 10 and 20 mg. kg. day in successive two week intervals.The control animals were handled each day and given an oral dose of 0.5 ml of corn oil, as a blank. At the end of the eight week period, the tumors of the control animals had total cross sectional areas which averaged 1957 square millimeters, and ranged from 512 square millimeters to 4030 square millimeters. The animals which had been treated with the compound of this invention, in contrast, had an average total cross sectional area of tumor of 345 square millimeters, ranging from complete regression to one animal having 1550 sq. mm. total cross sectional area.The tumors of this animal, however, were not estrogendependent, and did not regress when the animal was ovariectomized. One animal in the compound treated group could not be evaluated, because its tumors had changed to an impalpable form, or, perhaps, had completely regressed but had left some abnormalities in the tissue after its regression.Experiment B In this experiment, the same compound was administered at 20 mg. kg. day, orally, for four weeks.In other respects, the test was run in the same way as that of Experiment A above. At the end of the four weeks, the average total tumor area of the control animals was 487 square millimeters, ranging from 178 to 886 square millimeters. The tumors of one of the compound treated animals had completely regressed, with no palpable tumor present at the end of the four week period, the other five animals had tumor areas from 16 to 668 square millimeters the average total area of the treated animals was 152 square millimeters. The large tumor of the compound treated animal having an area of 668 square millimeters was found to shrink after ovariectomy, but its growth had been checked, and it had not significantly grown, since the second week of the experiment. Thus, it was apparently a partially estrogen dependent tumor.Experiment C This experiment was also carried out for four weeks, and two groups of treated animals were used.One group of animals received 20 mg. kg. day of the same compound used in Experiments A and B, and the other received 40 mg. kg. day. The animals were not ovariectomized at the end of the experiment. At the end of the four weeks, the control animals, of which there were ten, were found to have an average total tumor area of 958 square millimeters, ranging from 168 to 2,094 square millimeters. The average cross sectional tumor area of the animals which received the low dose of the compound of this invention was 441 square millimeters, with a range from no tumors present to 1907 square millimeters. The animals which received the high dose of the compound had even smaller tumors, averaging 304 square millimeters, with a range from 116 to 758 square millimeters.Experiment D This experiment was followed for five weeks.The treated animals received 1 mg. kg. per day of 6 methoxy 2 4 hydroxyphenyl 3 4 2 piperidinoethoxy benzoyl benzo bjthiophene, hydrochloride, as a subcutaneous injection in corn oil. The animals were not ovariectomized at the end of the experiment. At the end of four weeks, the seven control animals had an average total tumor area of 1,446 square millimeters, ranging from 592 to 2,400. At the end of five weeks, the tumors of two of the control animals had burst and were unmeasurable the tumors of the other five controls averaged 1,487 square millimeters in total area, ranging from 966 to 2,123. The tumors of three of the eight treated animals had completely regressed by the fourth week of the test the average total tumor area of the treated group was 692 square millimeters. If one animal having a tumor area of 3764 sq. mm. is ignored, the average tumor area of the other seven is 254 sq. mm. At the fifth week of the test, the largest tumors of the treated animal having the largest total at four weeks had burst and were unmeasurable. The other seven treated animals averaged 398 square millimeters, ranging from the three completely regressed animals to one with a single 1974 sq. mm. tumor. Test 7 Anti Androgen Tests The antiandrogenic property of the compounds was evaluated in the following tests, in which the compound of Example 3 was used again. Experiment A The animals used in this test were adult male rats having a body weight which averaged about 330 g.when the experiment ended. All of the animals to be used in the experiment were castrated by the scrotal route, and were held untreated for 3 days. On the fourth day, subcutaneous administration of 0.1 mg. day of an exogenous androgen, testosterone propionate, was begun, and was continued for seven consecutive days.An untreated control group of animals received injections of 0.1 ml. day of corn oil as a blank treatment.The compound of this invention was administered orally or subcutaneously to the treated animals in 0.1 ml. of corn oil, at the same time that the androgen was administered. The animals were sacrificed 24 hours after the last injection of testosterone propionate, the ventral prostate glands were removed and weighed, and the mean of the weights of each treatment group was reported. The table below reports the mean weights resulting from administration of various doses of the compound along with androgen. Each treatment group of animals in this experiment consisted of seven to nine animals, except for the untreated control group, which contained twelve animals. The results of the experiment were as follows. Mean Prostate Treatment Weight Untreated control 40 mg. Androgen only 309 1 mg. day compound, S.C. 201 0.1 mg. day compound, S.C. 235 0.0a mg. day compound, S.C. 253 1 mg. day compound, oral 242 0.1 mg. day compound, oral 267 0.01 mg. day compound, oral 192 Experiment B This experiment was carried out in the same manner as Experiment A above, except that the test animals were immature male rats, weighing about 120 g.each at sacrifice. Each treatment group consisted of six or seven animals. All treatments in this experiment were administered by subcutaneous injection. The amount of the androgen administered was only 20 mcg. day because of the small size of the animals. Mean Prostate Treatment Weight Untreated control 12.6 mg. Androgen only 48.7 S mg. kg. day compound 36.6 0.5 mg. kg. day compound 33.8 One animal in this group had a surprisingly large prostate weighing 54 mg. If this animal is excluded from the group, the average weight is 30.5. Experiment C This experiment was also conducted in immature rats having average body weight of about 115 g.when the experiment ended. In other respects, the experiment was as described under Experiment B above.The treatment groups consisted of ten animals each, except for the androgen only group, of 16 animals, and the 5 mg. kg. group, of nine animals. Mean Prostate Treatment Weight Untreated control 11.4 mg. Androgen only 43.5 5 mg. kg. day compound 29.0 0.5 mg. kg. day compound 31.1 0.05 mg. kg. day compound 34.0 The experiments above show clearly that the representative compound of this invention in the tests inhibited a large part of the abnormal prostate growth caused by the administration of exogenous androgen, and therefore that the compounds of this invention are of interest and importance in the treatment of androgendependent abnormal conditions, especially benign prostatic hypertrophy and prostatic cancer. As has been stated, this invention provides a method of alleviating a pathological condition of an endocrine target organ, which condition is dependent or partially dependent on an estrogen or on an androgen, which comprises administering an effective dose of a compound as described above to a subject suffering from such a condition or at risk of suffering from such a condition.
