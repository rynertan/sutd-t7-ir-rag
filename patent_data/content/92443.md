## Description
SUNFLOWER SEED MILK The present invention relats to drinking compositions and their production, and provides an aqueous vegetable seed milk composition comprising sunflower seed constituents, the composition having a pH of at most 8.0 and containing at least sunflower seed proteins and lipids but substantially no solid matter from sunflower seed hulls. The constituents of the composition are present in the aqueous medium principally in any of the conditions of emulsion, suspension and dissolution, in the state generally called vegetable seed milk.The compositions of the present invention include those obtained by separating protein and lipid seed constituents e.g. by means of extraction and mixing and emulsifying the separated products. Sunflower seed is an oil seed with the second largest output in the world its output in the 1978 79 agricultural year is said to be about 13,000,000 tonnes Yushi Oil and Fat , Vol.33, 54 . Heretofore, of the constituents of sunflower seed, the oil alone has been used for human consumption other constituents, proteins and glucosides, have been used only in animal feedstuff. Also, the use of processed sunflower seed for human food is said to be unsatisfactory, although it is seen in part in snack foods. Generally, sunflower seed contains 40 to 602 of oil, which has high contents not only of linoleic acid, an unsaturated fatty acid, but also of a tocopherol which is vitamen E of strong physiological activity. Further, sunflower seed is rich in vitamin B complex, and proteins from the seed contain sulfurcontaining amino acids in relatively large amounts.Sunflower seed is thus an important food resource in terms of health, and in the present situation of worldwide food shortage development of novel foods from sunflower seed and its constituents is an important contribution to the effective use of under exploited food resources. We have found no patents or literature on compositions containing as essential constituents sunflower seed lipids and proteins, but there is one case in which sunflower seed proteins have been proposed for use in a drink. As far as we know, the only case of this is disclosed in Can.Inst.Food Sci.Technol. J., Vol.10, 229 1977 , according to which cow s milk is enriched by defatting sunflower seeds with petroleum ether, further treating the defatted powder to remove chlorogenic acid, which causes coloration and then blending the product with cow s milk. This protein enriched milk contains substantially no lipids and is fundamentally different from the composition according to the present invention. Although sunflower seed has characteristics as described above, vegetable seed milk obtained from it, because of chlorogenic acid and polyphenols contained in the seed, is colored green and has an astringent taste, and was therefore considered unsuitable for drinking. In addition, since proteins in sunflower seed are globulins sparingly soluble in water, the vegetable seed milk is low in protein content and watery, and was considered to be inferior in tastiness for drinking purpose. The present invention provides a vegetable seed milk comprising the constituents of sunflower seed which can be superior in smell, taste and color to prior seed milks. Conventional vegetable seed milk includes soy milk made from soyabean which is produced in large amounts by the modern process. Soy milk has an unfavourable grassy smell, heavy flavour and bitterness and in spite of the recent considerable progress of deodorizing techniques, it does not yet find general acceptance. The composition according to the invention has no such unfavourable flavour and bitterness. The solid content of the composition according to the present invention is not critical, but it is preferably 3 to 20 , more preferably 5 to 15 . In the composition of the present invention, lipids and proteins from sunflower seed are essential components, but constituents of other oil seeds and or animal proteins may also be present. As the oil seeds other than sunflower seed, soyabean, peanut, pine nut, sesame, cacao bean, safflower and the like may be used according to taste. It is desirable that the constituents of sunflower seed constitute no less than 20 of the total non aqueous content of the composition of the present invention. The composition according to the present invention contains substantially no solid matter from the sunflower seed hull since the hull is made up of insoluble polysaccharides e.g. cellulose , lignins, etc., it would give a blackish color to the composition even if finely pulverized, and would make the composition undesirably rough to the tongue. It is therefore desirable to remove the hull from sunflower seeds in advance or by centrifugation in the course of production to make the composition substantially free from the hull. The pH of the composition of the present invention is 8.0 or less. When the pH is more than 8.0 the composition has undesirable color and smell in extreme cases, the composition may be green and or have a mouldy odor suggestive of wet soil. As to the physiochemical state of the composition according to the present invention, it is essential that the constituents of sunflower seed or other components are not in simple admixture, but in emulsion, suspension or dissolution, in the aqueous medium, i.e. in the state of the so called vegetable seed milk. Thus, said composition is a novel one suitable for drinking having a milky white to slightly yellowish cream appearance as well as fluidity to semi fluidity. The composition according to the present invention may be used for drinking with or without flavoring or perfuming according to taste or need, and it may be eaten in semi solid gelled condition. The composition is fundamentally a simulated dairy product, and may be used as such where milk, for example cow s milk, is used. The composition of the present invention may contain other components such as milk proteins, polysaccharides, edible reducing agents, metallic ion chelating agents, surfactants, pH regulators, and the like. The sunflower seed milk alone is not always storage stable and on long storage may gel and coagulate to become unsuitable for drinking. To improve storage stability it is desirable to add milk proteins and or polysaccharides. The milk protein may be used in the form of milk, dairy products and substances or compositions containing proteins extracted therefrom. As milk, cow s milk, goat s milk and the like are available according to taste, but cow s milk is preferred because of its abundance and stability. As dairy products, skim milk, concentrated milk, whole milk powder, skim milk powder, whey and the like may be used. Further, substances or compositions containing proteins extracted from milk or dairy products include for example casein and its potassium, sodium or calcium salt and compositions containing them, lactalbumin and the like. The protein content of sunflower seed milk is low compared with its lipid content and it is sometimes preferred to enrich the proteins. Milk proteins may thus not only improve storage stability but also usefully enrich the protein content milk proteins also improve the amino acid pattern and the tastiness of the product. The amount of these milk proteins added is not critical, but a suitable amount thereof is 1 to 200 , as milk proteins, based on the vegetable seed proteins preferably, the amount is to to 50 . Of the foregoing milk proteins, cow s milk, skim milk obtained from cow s milk, skim milk powder, whey, casein, the potassium, sodium or calcium salt of casein, and lactalbumin are preferably used. Polysaccharides may be used alone or together with milk proteins. As polysaccharides, for example pectin, alginic acid, sodium alginate, carrageean, gum arabic, gum tragacanth, cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose and the like may be used. A sufficient amount of polysaccharides is 0.01 to 5 based on the vegetable seed milk composition more preferably, the amount is 0.05 to 1.0 . Further, metallic ion chelating agents may be used, if necessary, to inhibit the function of metallic ions which are contained in vegetable seed milk and considered to promote the gelation and coloration of the vegetable seed milk. As metallic ion chelating agents polyphosphoric, citric and phytic acids and potassium or sodium salts thereof may be used. By using metallic ion chelating agent, gelation of vegetable seed milk particularly gelation on heating can be prevented to some degree the effect on prolonged storage stability is not always satisfactory, however, and it may therefore be preferred to use milk proteins together with metallic ion chelating agents. A sufficient amount of metallic ion chelating agent used is 0.001 to 2 , preferably 0.01 to 1 . More preferably, edible reducing agents such as ascorbic acid, erisorbic acid, sulfurous acid and the sodium and potassium salts thereof and the like may be used for preventing vegetable seed milk from coloration during storage. The amount of reducing agent is not critical, but may be 0.001 to 5 based on the vegetable seed milk. For example, with vegetable seed milk having a solid content of about 10 , the object of the present invention can sufficiently be achieved by the addition of 0.1 to 1.0 of the agent. In producing the composition of the present invention, a thin skin, called a skin layer, is preferably removed from the sunflower seeds in order to obtain a smoother taste. The kind of sunflower seed ranges from those having an oil content of about 50 called oil seeds to those having a relatively low oil content called confectionary seeds . In producing the composition of the present invention, these kinds may be appropriately selected according to taste, or used in mixtures without particular distinction. Production of the composition of the present invention with a mixture of sunflower seed and other oily seed is included in the scope of the present invention production of the composition by separately producing vegetable seed milks from sunflower seed and the other oily seed and mixing the milks is also included. As described above, there are various kinds of oily seed other than sunflower seed, but soyabean is preferred. Unlike sunflower seed, soyabean contains more proteins than lipids, and for example, when a sunflower seed soyabean 1 1 by weight mixture is used as a raw material, compositions containing lipids and proteins in a ratio of about 1 1 can be obtained, and the grassy smell peculiar to soy milk can be decreased substantially.The first limiting amino acid of sunflower seed is lysine, while an amino acid that soyabean lacks is a sulfur containing acid such as methionine and cystine.Consequently, by using sunflower seed and soyabean together as raw material, emulsified drinks improved in amino acid composition and richer in nutriment are obtained. In the present invention, in order to regulate the lipid protein ratio of vegetable seed milk according to taste and to achieve a further improvement in nutriment and tastiness, not only sunflower seed alone, but also any of a defatted products and lipids obtained thereform, b oily seeds other than sunflower seed and c defatted products and lipids obtained from b also can be used as raw material. In the present invention, therefore, the term 1sunflower seed used as raw material means not only the seed itself, but also secondary processed products containing the constituents of the seed. Similarly, the term oily seeds other than sunflower seed also includes secondary processed products containing the constituents thereof. By choice of raw material the lipid content is reduced or the protein content increased according to taste, thereby regulating the lipid protein ratio to, for example, about 1 1 which is similar to that of cow s milk. In such a case, vegetable seed milk may be produced from mixed raw material, as described above, but a protein lipid ratio suited to taste can also be obtained by using previously defatted sunflower seed or the seed and other materials in producing the vegetable seed milk. The defatting method is not critical, and defatting may be carried out, for example, by pressing and or extraction with n hexane solvent. As the defatted product of sunflower seed, either of more than 80 defatted products substantially free from lipids or partially defatted products obtained by 20 to 80 defatting, will do. Preferably, the defatting is carried out so as to minimize the denaturation of proteins by heat and solvent. As examples of the defatted products subtantially free from lipids, oil cake, which is a by product from commercial production of sunflower oil, and the like may be used. Generally, lipids are substantially absent from oil cake after separation of sunflower oil generally called meal or flour , concentrates and isolates having an increased content of proteins. For producing vegetable seed milk having a desired protein lipid ratio using these defatted products of sunflower seed substantially free from lipids, it is sufficient to add lipids as need arises. Consequently, when sunflower seed substantially free from lipids is used, vegetable seed milk having a desired protein lipid ratio can be produced by adding a non defatted sunflower seed or a sunflower oil and or a vegetable oil other than sunflower. Also the defatted product or lipids of oil seeds other than sunflower seed may be added. As the vegetable oil other than sunflower, the oil of various oil seeds, for example, safflower oil, corn oil, soyabean oil, cotton seed oil, palm oil, etc. may be used. The method of adding these oils is not critical for example, in a step of pulverizing defatted sunflower seeds, these oils are added simultaneously or the defatted sunflower seeds are pulverized in the presence of water having these oils previously emulsified therein. In this case, lipids other than those of sunflower seed enter the vegetable seed milk, but the flavour of sunflower seed is sufficiently made use of unlike a case wherein a simple mixture of sunflower seed and soyabean is used as raw material. When partially defatted products of sunflower seed are used, it is sufficient to previously defat a required amount so as to obtain vegetable seed milk having a desired protein lipid ratio. By this means, desired vegetable seed milk can be obtained using the defatted product alone of sunflower seed. In this case, addition of lipids is not always necessary, but lipids may be added for further regulation of the protein lipid ratio. When vegetable seed milk is produced using sunflower seeds not partially defatted to a desired degree, vegetable seed milk having a desired protein lipid ratio can be produced by the addition of proteins or lipids. It is undesirable to store defatted sunflower seed for long periods, so that after the defatting immediate production of the vegetable seed milk is preferred. By using the defatted material as described above, compositions of the present invention having, for example, a protein content of 0.1 to 10 and a lipid content of 0.1 to 20 can be produced. When the composition is however used for drinking as vegetable seed milk, both its protein content and lipid content are preferably about 1 to about 5 . Further, when it is used, for example, as coffee whitener or whipped topping, it is preferred that the protein content is about 1 to about 5 and the lipid content is about 10 to about 20 . Vegetable seed milk can be produced, for example, by pulverizing sunflower seeds in the presence of water to extract the constituents of the seeds into the aqueous phase, and separating solid matters from the aqueous extract. Sunflower seed or a mixture of sunflower seed and other oily seed may be roughly crushed prior to the steps described below. In the present invention, sunflower seed, and any other oily seeds used together therewith, may separately be soaked in water prior to pulverization.The soaking time and temperature required are not critical, but such a high temperature and prolonged soaking as to cause thermal coagulation of proteins should be avoided. One object of soaking is to remove as much chlorogenic acid as possible and it is therefore best to remove the soaking water by draining .This object can be attained by prolonged soaking at less than 40 C, for example, about room temperature, or by shorter soaking at more than 40 C. A temperature more than 40 C is preferred also for obtaining more stable vegetable seed milk, and more preferably the temperature is 70 to 140 C. High temperature and prolonged soaking is not preferred because of the percent recovery of proteins being lowered. Consequently, such soaking conditions as 700C x within 2 hours, 1000C in boiling water x within 30 minutes, 1200C x within 20 minutes, etc. can be given as example. For carrying out soaking either boiling or steaming may be employed in addition to soaking in aqueous media, provided that substantial thermal coagulation of proteins is avoided. When sunflower seed and other oil seeds are to be used together, it is preferred that they are separately soaked, to avoid migration to the other seeds and hence presence in the milk product of chlorogenic acid soaked from the sunflower seed. For the same reason, the seed after soaking is preferably drained before the subsequent steps. However, a liquor obtained by soaking of seeds other than sunflower seed and then draining, may be used for soaking sunflower seeds. This is preferred not only for reducing the amount of waste water to be treated, but also because chlorogenic acid from sunflower seed is reduced by its reaction with proteins present in the liquor, so that loss of sunflower seed protein owing to reaction with chlorogenic acid is decreased. The seed after soaking and draining may be roughly crushed prior to pulverization. When sunflower seed is used together with other oily seeds, the rough crushing may be carried out either before or after mixing the seeds. The roughly crushed seed may be soaked, but such a degree of rough crushing should be avoided as to increase the effusion of the constituents of the seed. The seed, optionally after soaking and draining as above, is then pulverized in the presence of water. The object of pulverization first step is pulverization and dispersion for carrying out an efficient extraction of the seed constituents. Pulverization can be carried out with conventional equipment e.g. cutter type mixers, colloid mills, grinder type mills, hammer mills, etc. Two or more machines, which may be same or different, may be used connected in series. This operation may be carried out batchwise or continuously. The amount of water used is not critical, but from the standpoints of protein concentration and taste, it is preferably not more than 30 times by weight, preferably about 5 times by weight based on the seed. The water used is not critical, and it may be any of city water, ion exchange water, distilled water, alkaline water, heated water, deaerated water and the like. Further, milk protein, edible reducing agent and the like may be added at this first step, and in this case, they may be previously pulverized in the presence of added water. After pulverization solid matter is removed from the extract by usual means such as filtration or centrifugation It is preferred that the pulverized product has an adjusted pH.of 6.5 to 7.5. After completion of the first step, the pulverized product is preferably heat treated with stirring second step . In the second step, it is more preferred for the vegetable seed milk to have an adjusted pH of 6.5 to 7.5. After completion of the second step, it is further preferred to re pulverize the vegetable seed milk third step . As described hereinbefore, the first step is . one to pulverize sunflower seed in the presence of water. When a mixture of sunflower seed and other different oil seeds is used in place. of sunflower seed, both the seeds are mixed prior to this step. Consequently, in explanation on this step and steps following it, unless otherwise stated, the term sunflower seed shall also mean a mixture of sunflower seed and oily seeds other than sunflower seed . The pH adjustment of vegetable seed milk obtained at the first step is carried out by adding an alkaline substance.The addition of alkaline substance is carried out on or after pulverization, but the pH may be adjusted in steps on and after pulverization. When insoluble solid matter is removed after completion of pulvewization, the p9 needs to be adjusted before the removal of said solid matter. The pH regulating agent is not critical, but alkaline substances such as sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium hydrogencarbonate, sodium phosphate, sodium monohydrogenphosphate, sodium citrate, etc. and aqueous solutions thereof may be used. When the pH is less than 6.5, the protein content and solid content of vegetable seed milk obtained by the removal of said insoluble solid matters are lowered, thereby giving a watery taste. While pH values more than 7.5 give increased protein content and solid content, but are not preferred in terms of the color and smell of the vegetable seed milk obtained.That is, when the pH is made 7.5 or more, the coloration of vegetable seed milk increases, and in extreme cases, the vegetable seed milk is colored green. Also, the vegetable seed milk may have a mouldy odor suggestive of wet soil. In the second step, the vegetable seed milk or slurry obtained by pulverization may be maintained with stirring at a temperature of from 650C to the boiling point. This step may be carried out by stirring the vegetable seed milk or slurry by means of a temperature controllable line mixer during transportation between the first step and the third step, or by maintaining it at such temperature in a stirring vessel. The elevated temperature is preferably maintained for not less than 5 minutes, e.g. for 180 minutes. For stirring, usual stirring is satisfactory, and high speed and high shear stirring machines as used in pulverization and emulsification are not always necessary.The present inventors examined the influence on protein recovery of the temperature and time of the soaking of sunflower seed. As a result, it was found that the percent recovery of proteins was lowered with increase in the soaking time and soaking temperature.On 10 minutes and 30 minutes soaking at varying temperatures of 600C, 80tC and 1000 C, reduction in the percent recovery of proteins became larger at higher temperatures and, for the same temperature, at longer periods of soaking time. The present inventors assumed that this phenomenon was due to the thermal coagulation of proteins. For the heat treatment step second step , however, the present inventors surprisingly found that the percent recovery of proteins after the removal of insoluble solid matter increased at higher temperatures and at longer periods of retention time. That is, when 10 minutes and 30 minutes heat treatment carried out with stirring at varying temperatures of 500C, 650C and 80VC, the.percent recovery of proteins after the removal of insoluble solid matters increased at higher temperatures and, for the same temperature, at longer periods of retention time. The effect of the temperature of this heating step on the percent recovery of proteins is not related to whether or not soaking has been carried out and when soaking has been carried out, the effect is not related to the soaking conditiors,giving a larger percent recovery of proteins as an increase in the temperature and retention time of this step. When the temperature and retention time of this step are definite, however, the percent recovery of proteins depends upon wheLher or not soaking. has been carried out or the soaking condition, and it is largest when soaking has not been carried out. In this second step, it is more preferred for the vegetable seed milk to have an adjusted pH of 6.5 to 7.5. The pH adjustment is carried out by the addition of the foregoing pH regulating agents. The addition of the agent may be at the first and or second step. When the pH is adjusted at the first step, it is preferred to use alkaline water as the water for pulverization.As the alkaline water, aqueous solutions of the foregoing pH regulating agents may be used. By regulating both the temperature and the pH, the percent recovery of proteins and that of solid matters are further improved, and vegetable seed milk having an improved taste is obtained. The third step is one to re pulverize vegetable seed milk after the second step. Re pulverization can be carried out in the same manner as in the first step, and the equipment used may be the same as used in the first step, but in this case, high pressure homogenizers can effectively be used. The third step makes the recovery of proteins and solid matters more efficient and improves emulsion stability. From the sunflower seed milk obtained through the third step, are removed insoluble solid matters as need arises. For the removal of said matters, centrifuges, sieves, etc. may be used. To vegetable seed milk after removal of the insoluble solid matters may be pasteurized or sterilized, homogenized, cooled, filled or the like if necessary.These steps may be carried out satisfactorily by the usual methods.For the homogenization, for example, high pressure homogenizers can effectively be used. A method having a combination of the first, second and third steps is very desirable. Vegetable seed milk can be produced by the method as described above, but, as mentioned above, it is preferred to add milk proteins in order to prevent the seed milk from gelation. Milk proteins may be added at the first, second or third step.The addition may be carried out even after the third step, and when pasteurization or sterilization is to be applied, it is preferably carried out before pasteurization or sterilization. When milk proteins are powdery, they may be added as aqueous solution. Similarly, polysaccharides, metallic ion chelating agents and edible reducing agents may be added at any of the foregoing steps. Suitable sweetening agents, perfuming agents, coloring agents, flavoring agents and the like may be added to the vegetable seed milk thus obtained according to taste. As described above, sunflower seed and proteins obtained thereform are very important resources, but at present, it is a fact that use of sunflower seed as foods and that of proteins extracted therefrom is limited. One of the reasons for this is that, since sunflower seed contains polyphenols, particularly chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid, green and brown colorations occur under heating and alkaline conditions. Such coloration not only lowers the value of sunflower seed as foods, but also restricts the utility of proteins because of the proteins turning insoluble owing to their reaction with the polyphenols. The conventionally employed method to remove polyphenols, particularly chlorogenic acid, having undesirable properties like this is extraction with organic solvents, as disclosed, for example, in Japanese Patent Application Laid open No.108100 1976. In the method disclosed in said applicationSunflower seed is powdered, defatted with n hexane and dried to obtain a powder, and this powder is extracted eight times with an extracting solvent comprising a dilute hydrochloric acid having a pH of 2.30 and 92 parts of n butyl alcohol, of which the pH is kept, for example, at the isoelectric point of protein. This method is good in chlorogenic acid extracting effect, but not always satisfactory in that, since an organic solvent is used as extracting solvent, problems such as residual toxicity and denaturation of protein are caused. In addition, since the extraction should be repeated eight to ten times in order to carry it out effectively, eight to ten extracting vessels should be installed to apply this method in industry. Consequently, this method is not a satisfactory one. Also, this method is quite useless as a means to remove polyphenols from the vegetable seed milk according to the present invention. The present invention allows one to remove polyphenols from vegetable seed milk obtained by pulverization of sunflower seed in the presence of water, and by this method, polyphenols can be removed easily and effectively from the vegetable seed milk. Consequently, the vegetable seed milk obtained by this method of the present invention shows little or no coloration under heating or alkali conditions. The characteristic ofthis method of the present invention is that an object to be treated for the removal of polyphenols is vegetable seed milk obtained by pulverizing sunflower seed in the presence of alkali by means such as grinding. The vegetable seed milk . is produced, for example, by the foregoing methods. In removing polyphenols, the removal of insoluble solid matters present in the vegetable seed milk is not always necessary, but for a prolonged continuous run, to remove the insoluble solid matters at either one of the steps in the course of vegetable seed milk production is desirable. As means to remove polyphenols, molecular sieve membranes may be used. The material and form of molecular sieve membranes are not particularly limited, and cellulose membranes, ultrafiltration membranes having an anisotropic structure, disk form flat membranes, hollow fibers and the like may optionally be used according to the method of use. Also, molecular sieve membranes may optionally be used for dialysis, concentration, diafiltration, etc. Further, as means to remove polyphenols, various types of adsorbing resin may also be used. As such resin, adsorbing resins of polystyrene type, particularly various types of non functional type resin, for example, commercially available products such as Duolite S 861, DuoliteS862, Duolite S 863 styrene type adsorbing resins, Sumitomo Chemical Co. Ltd. and the like, may be used effectively. The method of using adsorbing resins is not critical, and for example, it may be either of a batch form or continuous form wherein vegetable seed milk is passed through a column packed with the resins. The vegetable seed milk obtained as above may also be used as coffee whitener and whipped topping with addition of vegetable oils. Recently, various simulated dairy products making use of soyabean protein and or vegetable fat have been developed, and used as coffee whitener and whipped topping. But soyabean protein used for the production of various simulated dairy products, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid open No.144764 1976, is sq Axan protein isolates. Fundamentally, coffee whitener and whipped topping ought to be produced by adding a vegetable oil and fat to soyabean milk having appropriate solid content, followed by emulsification, but . expensive soyabean protein isolates is used because the grassy smell peculiar to soyabean does not suit the flavor of coffee whitener and whipped topping. Contrary to this, vegetable seed milk compositions containing an increased oil content as compared with protein content obtained by adding a vegetable oil and fat to the vegetable seed milk of the present invention, are suitable as coffee whitener and whipped topping. As vegetable seed milk used as material for this purpose, vegetable seed milk comprising sunflower seed or sunflower seed and a seed other than sunflower seed may be used. As the seed other than sunflower seed,soyabean peanut, pine nut and the like may be used according to taste. The amount of vegetable oil and fat used is preferably 2 to 30 times by weight based on the protein content of the vegetable seed milk. The proportion of vegetable fat in the total composition including fat resulting from vegetable seed milk is, for example, preferably about 3 to about 20 for use as coffee whitener, and about 20 to about 35 for use as whipped topping. As the vegetable oil and fat, cocoa nut oil, palm oil, cacao oil, sunflower oil, soyabe oil, cotton seed oil and the like may be used. preferably, for the purpose of improving the stability of emulsion comprising sunflower seed milk and vegetable oil and fat, surface active agents are added. By adding surface active agents, an emulsion condition useful as coffee whitener and whipped topping can be maintained. As the surface active agents, glycerin fatty acid esters, sorbitan fatty acid esters and sucrose fatty acid esters are preferably used. A suitable amount of surface active agent to use is 0.05 to 5 based on the vegetable seed milk more preferably, the amount is 0.1 to 2 . A pH regulating agent may be added if necessary.particularly when the vegetable seed milk composition of the present invention is used as coffee whitener. The term pH regulating agent referred to herein means an inorganic salt acting as a buffer to prevent proteins from coagulation and precipitation due to the acidity of coffee, even when the vegetable seed milk composition of the present invention is used as coffee whitener. As such a pHregulating agent, there may be used phosphates, citrates, borates and the like, e.g. disodium hydrogen phosphate, dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium citrate and the like. A suitable amount of pH regulating agent is 0.05 to 5 based on the vegetable seed milk more preferably, the amount is 0.1 to 2 . More preferably, in these cases, milk proteins and polysaccharides are also added to prevent the gelation and coagulation of the vegetable seed milk composition. It is also preferred to use edible reducing agents in order to prevent coloration. The content of water from skim milk and concen trated milk among milk and dairy products, together with that of water from vegetable seed milk, is important because the water content of the foregoing composition is mainly determined by said content. The water content of the foregoing composition is not critical, but is limited to some degree depending upon the form and method of use of the composition.For example, when the composition is used as coffee whitener, its water content is preferably about 60 to about 90 in general, and when used as whipped topping, its water content is preferably about 50 to about 70 in general. Consequently, the solid content of vegetable seed milk, amount of vegetable fat added, and solid content of milk and or dairy products should be regulated so as to obtain a water content suitable for the form and method of use. The foregoing vegetable seed milk composition can be regulated by blending with vegetable seed milk, vegetable oil and fat, surface active agents and if necessary, pH regulating agents, and preferably, additional milk proteins, polysaccharides, edible reducing agents and metallic ion chelating agents.For example, the regulation of the composition can be carried out as follows To sunflower seed milk, or vegetable seed milk obtained from sunflower seed and O oily seeds other than sunflower seed, are added surface active agents and if necessary, pH regulating agents and preferably, nilk proteins, polysaccharides, edible reducing agents and metallic ion chelating agents with stirring to obtain a vegetable seed milk composition the vegetable seed milk composition thus obtained is pre emulsified after or while adding vegetable oil and fat, to which surface active agent has been added if necessary, so that the amount of the vegetable oil and fat is 2 to 30 times by weight based on proteins contained in the vegetable seed milk and after pasteurization or sterilization, the pre emulsified composition is further homogenized by means of a high pressure homogenizer. For the pre emulsification, the commonly employed equipment having a mechanical stirrer may be used satisfactorily.Such equipment includes for example cutter type homogenizers.The stirring time is not critical, but preferably is about 5 to about 30 minutes. Further, for minimizing coloration, stirring under non oxygen atmosphere or under reduced pressure is preferred. Homogenization by high pressure homogenizers may be carried out by either a one step or a two step one. In the onestep method, the pressure is preferably regulated to 100 to 300 kg cm2, and in the two step method, the pressure is preferably regulated to 100 to 200 kg cm2 for the first step, and 50 to 150 kg cm2 for the second step. In practicing the present invention, in addition to the foregoing components, other components, as usually added to this type of simulated dairy product, such as perfuming agents, coloring agents, flavoring agents, etc. may be added if necessary. The present invention is illustrated in more detail with reference to the following Examples,Example 1 Five hundred grams of a hull free dehulled sunflower seed was soaked for 5 minutes in 2,000 g of boiling water, followed by draining.
