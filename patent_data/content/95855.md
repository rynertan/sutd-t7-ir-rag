## Description
PROCESS FOR POLYMERIZING ETHYLENE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1 Field of the Invention This invention relates to a process for the polymerization of ethylene. More particularly, it relates to a process for the high pressure polymerization of ethylene or a mixture of ethylene with an a olefin having at least three carbon atoms using a Ziegler type catalyst having an enhanced activity. 2 Description of the Prior Art Several proposals have been made on the high pressure polymerization of ethylene using a Ziegler type catalyst. For example, Japanese Examined PatentPublication No. 48 6183 discloses a process in which a catalyst obtained from a trivalent titanium compound and an organic aluminum compound is preliminarily treated by contacting the catalyst with an a olefin and ethylene is polymerized under a high pressure in the presence of the preliminarily treated catalyst. According to this process, the amount of polyethylene formed per unit amount of the trivalent titanium compound used is small.For example, in Example 1 of this patent publication, the amount of polyethylene formed per gram of titanium trichloride is as small as about 8,600 g, and therefore, the operation of removing the catalyst residue from the formed polyethylene is indispensable. As means for increasing the yield of polyethylene based on the catalyst used, there is known a process in which ethylene is polymerized under a high pressure in the presence of a catalyst obtained from a solid catalyst component comprising a titanium compound supported on a magnesium compound and an organic aluminum compound see JapaneseUnexamined Patent Publications No. 56 99209 and No.56 161406 . The amount of polyethylene formed per unit amount of the solid catalyst component according to this process is much larger than in the above mentioned process. However, in order to omit the operation of removing the catalyst residue from the formed polyethylene, it is necessary to further increase the yield of polyethylene based on the solid catalyst component. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is a primary object of the present invention to provide a process for the high pressure polymerization of ethylene in which the amount of polyethylene formed per unit amount of the solid catalyst component is very large. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a process for the polymerization of ethylene, which comprises polymerizing ethylene or a mixture of ethylene with an alpha olefin having at least 3 carbon atoms under a pressure of at least 200 kg cmê at a temperature not lower than 125QC in the presence of a catalyst obtained from A a solid catalyst component and B an organic aluminum compound represented by the following formula I Rn4AlXê3 n I wherein R4 is an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, Xê is a halogen atom, and n is a number of from 1.5 to 3, said solid catalyst component being obtained by 1 reacting an aluminum halide with a silicon compound represented by the following formula II 2 R1 Si OR 4 m Il m1 wherein RÚ is an alkyl group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms or a phenyl group, Rê is an alkyl group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, and m is 0, 1, 2 or 3, 2 reacting the reaction product with a Grignard compound represented by the following formula III R3MgX1 III wherein R3is an alkyl group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms and X1 is a halogen atom, to form a carrier, and then, 3 contacting the carrierwith a titanium tetrahalide. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS According to the present invention, polyethylene is obtained in an extremely high yield based on the solid catalyst component. Therefore, the operation of removing the catalyst residue from the polyethylene as formed can be omitted. Furthermore, not only a high density ethylene homopolymer, but also a linear low density ethylene copolymer can be obtained by copolymerizing ethylene with an a olefin having at least 3 carbon atoms.

It is preferable that the aluminum halide be used for the reaction in an amount of from 0.1 to 10 moles, more preferably from 0.3 to 2 moles, per mole of the silicon compound. The reaction of the aluminum halide with the silicon compound is ordinarily carried out by stirring both the compounds in an inert organic solvent at a temperature of from 500C to 1000C for from 0.1 to 2 hours. The reaction proceeds with generation of heat, and the reaction product is obtained in the form of a solution in the inert organic solvent. The reaction product is used in the form of the solution in the inert organic solvent for the reaction with a Grignard compound. As the Grignard compound represented by the formula III , an alkyl magnesium chloride, i.e., the compound of the formula III in which X1 is a chlorine atom, is preferably used.

A compound represented by the following formula R5 O R6 wherein R5 and R6 are an alkyl group having 2 to 8 carbon atoms, is preferably used as the ether in which the Grignard compound is dissolved. As examples of the ether, diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, di n butyl ether and diisoamyl ether can be mentioned. The reaction is carried out ordinarily at a temperature of from 50 to 1000C and preferably at a temperature of from 20 to 250C. The reaction time is not particularly cirtical, but ordinarily, the reaction is conducted for not less than 5 minutes. As the reaction proceeds, the formed white carrier is precipitated.

The so obtained solid catalyst component is separated from the reaction mixture by filtration and washed with an inert organic solvent. The titanium content in the solid catalyst component is 0.5 to 10 by weight. As specific preferred examples of the organic aluminum compound represented by the formula I , there can be mentioned those in which n is 3 namely, which is represented by the formula R34Al , such as triethyl aluminum, triisobutyl aluminum and tri n hexyl aluminum, and those in which n is less than 3 and X2 is a chlorine atom, such as dimethyl aluminum chloride, diethyl aluminum chloride, dibutyl aluminum chloride, dihexyl aluminum chloride, methyl aluminum sesquichloride, ethyl aluminum sesquichloride, butyl aluminum sesquichloride and hexyl aluminum sesquichloride. Of these organic aluminum compounds, those which are represented by the formula R4nAlX23n n is at least 1.5 but less than 3 are more preferable than those which are represented by 4 the formula R 3Al, because the former exhibit more enhanced catalytic activity.Diethyl aluminum chloride and dibutyl aluminum chloride are most preferable. The organic aluminum compound is ordinarily used in an amount of from 1 to 1000 moles per gram atom of titanium in the solid catalyst component. As specific examples of the inert organic solvent used in the respective stages in the preparation of the solid catalyst component, there can be mentioned aliphatic hydrocarbons such as n hexane and n heptane aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene and xylene and halogenated products thereof.
