# Mixing valves.

## Abstract
A thermally operated mixing valve including a single control knob 78 , a valve member 32 , a thermally respon sive control member 60 , and means for positively shutting off the flow of mixed liquid from a mixing chamber 56 when the valve is closed. In order that the mixing valve can maintain a pre set temperature of the flow of mixed liquid within closely control led limits, the valve member 32 is a jumper element mov able in opposite directions in a control chamber to restrict or cut off the flow of hot or cold liquid respectively. The valve member 32 can abut against a spring loaded annular abut ment ring 34 to shut off the flow of hot liquid to the mixing chamber 56 and when the abutment ring reaches the limit of its travel the valve member 32 can move away from it to allow hot liquid to flow to the mixing chamber 56 around the outside of said valve member 32 .
