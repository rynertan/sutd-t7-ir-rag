# Sheet stacking apparatus including an aligner.

## Abstract
An aligner 46 is positionable adjacent a sheet stack ing bin i.e. 14 to engage sheets fed to the bin and drive them to reference edge 32A . The aligner comprises a rotatable shaft 52 carrying resilient radial flaps. The flaps are of a size such that sheets fed to the bins are both edge and surface engaged by the flaps. Preferably, the slots between the flaps are arranged such that they are posi tioned in a helix round the shaft.
