# Scroll type fluid displacement machine and composite scroll type fluid displacement machine.

## Abstract
A scroll type hydraulic machine having a first station ary scroll 43 with a first scroll wrap 44 , a first orbiting scroll 29 with a second scroll wrap 42 on one surface thereof interleaved with the first scroll wrap 44 , a first orbiting scroll shaft 30 on the other surface of the first orbiting scroll 29 , a second stationary scroll 143 having a third scroll wrap 144 , a second orbiting scroll 130 having a fourth scroll wrap 142 on one surface interleaved with the third scroll wrap 144 , a second orbiting scroll shaft 130 provided on the other surface of the second orbiting scroll 129 , and a crank mechanism. The crank mechanism includes a rotatably driven crankshaft 20 having an eccen tric through hole 21 extending lengthwise therethrough, an eccentric shaft 22 rotatably supported by bearings 23 in the eccentric through hole 21 , and first and second eccen tric ring mechanisms 28, 128 . Each eccentric ring mecha nism is provided at one end of the eccentric shaft 22 and is rotatable with respect thereto. The orbiting scroll shafts 30, 130 are driven in an orbital pattern through the respec tive eccentric ring mechanisms 28, 128 .
