## Description
The present invention is directed to covalently modified bacterial polysaccharides and immunogenic proteins and to covalent conjugates of such polysaccharides linked by a bigeneric spacer, which permits proof of covalency and facilitates purification and concentration of biologically desirable entities, with immunogenic bacterial membrane or other proteins, which conjugates are useful components of bacterial vaccines. The present invention also relates to methods of preparing such polysaccharides, proteins and conjugates and methods of confirming the covalency of the conjugate linkage between polysaccharides and proteins. Purified capsular polysaccharides of bacteria have been used to prepare vaccines against the cognate bacteria, but the resulting immune responses have often been less satisfactory than desirable, especially in very young children or individuals with immature or deficient immunological systems. The Care must be exercised in the selection of the protein which is to be combined with these polysaccharides, however. Certain proteins e.g., pertussinogen are non specific stimulators of the immune system in infants. These proteins can, to a degree, enhance the immune response to polysaccharide antigens, but unfortunately, such non specific activation leads to unwanted biological effects i.e., reactogenicity . The much preferred specific enhanced immune responses to these polysaccharide antigens can be achieved in infants by conjugating these polysaccharides to appropriate proteins, as first reported by W. F. Goebel and O. T. Avery in 1929 The means of combining the polysaccharide and protein must also be carefully considered. If, as is believed, the immunological enhancement is realized as a result of the molecular proximity of the polysaccharide determinants to the protein carrier determinants, these moieties should not easily separate in the biological system. Non covalent complexes, arising from the polyanionic character of the polysaccharides and the polycationic character of carrier proteins, may stimulate immune responses, but these complexes are chemically labile and the resultant immune responses appear to show T cell independency. By contrast, covalent conjugates of polysaccharides and protein would possess much greater chemical stability and could demonstrate T cell dependent immune responses. Covalent polysaccharide protein conjugates have been claimed in the literature, but the exact nature of the covalent linkage has not been proven or quantified since the only assay for covalency has been activity Additionally, polysaccharides linked to diazotized aromatic amines were coupled to the protein s tyrosines in K. K. Nixdorff In none of these cases was covalency demonstrated other than by the implications of an aggregated molecular weight, thereby confusing covalency with the interaction of polyanions and polycations in molecular complexes, as these complexes will also give an aggregate molecular weight. It was therefore an object of this invention to link polysaccharide determinants to protein carrier determinants such that the molecular proximity of these moieties could be maintained in biological systems. It was another object of this invention to covalently link capsular polysaccharides with carrier proteins and to develop a method by which the covalent nature of this linkage could be proven and quantified. It was an additional object of this invention to obtain chemically stable polysaccharide protein conjugates which demonstrate T cell dependency and which would be useful as vaccine components for eliciting protective serum antibody to certain bacteria, particularly the cognate bacteria of the polysaccharides used. It was a further object of this invention to develop a method for solubilizing polysaccharides, particularly polyanionic polysaccharides, and covalently modifying these polysaccharides in preparation for preparing the polysaccharide protein conjugates. It was one more object of this invention to develop a method of purifying and concentrating covalently linked polysaccharide protein conjugates to remove unconjugated macromolecules and excess reactants. It was still a further object of this invention to develop methods of treatment employing these conjugates in immunologically effective vaccines for use against, e.g., meningitis and otitis media. The present invention is directed to covalently modified bacterial polysaccharides and to chemically stable conjugates of such polysaccharides with covalently modified immunogenic membrane proteins, viral protein subunits, synthetic polypeptides, bacterial toxoids or other suitable immunogenic proteins, which conjugates are useful components of immunogenic bacterial vaccines. The polysaccharide protein conjugates of this invention are coupled through bigeneric spacers containing a covalent thioether group, wherein the bigeneric spacers are atom chains linking macromolecules such as polysaccharides and proteins , part of which spacers originate with one modified macromolecule e.g., the covalently modified polysaccharide and the other part of which originate with the other modified macromolecule e.g., the functionalized protein . In the process according to the instant invention, the polysaccharide is covalently functionalized in one or more steps to produce a polysaccharide with pendant electrophilic centers or pendant thiol groups. Preferably, the polysaccharide is first solubilized in a non hydroxylic organic solvent, then derivatized with a bifunctional activation agent before being reacted with a bis nucleophile. The nucleophile functionalized polysaccharide is then either reacted with a reagent to generate pendant electrophilic sites or reacted with a reagent to generate pendant thiol groups. By proper selection of the bis nucleophile, i.e., one which would react with the activated polysaccharide and result in a covalently modified polysaccharide with pendant electrophilic sites or thiol groups, or selection of the proper nucleophile, further functionalization of the nucleophile functionalized polysaccharide may be avoided. Independent of the covalent modification of the polysaccharide, the appropriate bacterial carrier protein is reacted with reagents generating pendant thiol groups or with reagents generating pendant electrophilic centers, in either a one or two step process. The appropriately covalently modified polysaccharides and proteins are then reacted to form the covalent polysaccharide protein conjugates and purified to remove unconjugated macromolecules and excess reagents and to permit the immunogenic dosage to be determined based on covalently linked polysaccharide. The covalent nature of the linkage may be absolutely proven and defined by cleaving as by hydrolysis the polysaccharide from its pendant electrophilic or thiol group moiety, and cleaving the protein from its pendant thiol or electrophilic group moiety, then analyzing for the thioether containing bigeneric spacer molecule, such that determination of the spacer concentration relative to a marker amino acid lysine analysis for the protein determines covalency. Immunogenic vaccines containing immunologically effective amounts of the polysaccharide protein conjugates or their derivatives may then be prepared. The conjugates of the instant invention may be any stable polysaccharide protein conjugates, coupled through bigeneric spacers containing a thioether group and primary amine, which form hydrolytically labile covalent bonds with the polysaccharide and the protein. Preferred conjugates according to this invention, however, are those which may be represented by the formulae, Ps A E S B Pro or Ps A S E B Pro, wherein Ps represents a polysaccharide Pro represents a bacterial protein and A E S B and A S E B constitute bigeneric spacers which contain hydrolytically stable covalent thioether bonds, and which form covalent bonds such as hydrolytically labile ester or amide bonds with the macromolecules, Pro and Ps. In the spacer, A E S B, S is sulfur E is the transformation product of a thiophilic group which has been reacted with a thiol group, and is represented by The polysaccharides of this invention may be any bacterial polysaccharides with acid groups, but are not intended to be limited to any particular types. Examples of such bacterial polysaccharides include The proteins according to this invention are those of proven safety and demonstrable immunogenicity, but are not limited to any particular type. Suitable proteins include bacterial membrane proteins any of various plant proteins, such as edestin or soybean trypsin inhibitor viral protein subunits, such as hepatitis A or B, herpes gD or gC, Epstein Barr or varicella zoster subunits synthetic polypeptides diphtheria toxoid or tetanus toxoid, but are preferably Then the conjugates, Ps A E S B Pro, according to this invention may contain spacers whose components include derivatives of, In the process of the instant invention, the polysaccharide is covalently modified by a solubilizing it in a non hydroxylic organic solvent, then b activating it with a bifunctional reagent, c reacting this activated polysaccharide with a bis nucleophile, and finally, if necessary, further d functionalizing this modified polysaccharide by either reaction, i with a reagent generating electrophilic e.g., thiolphilic sites or, ii with a reagent generating thiol groups. The protein is conversely either reacted i with a reagent generating thiol groups or ii with a reagent generating thiolphilic sites, then the covalently modified polysaccharide and the functionalized protein are reacted together to form the stable covalently bonded conjugate and the final mixture is purified to remove unreacted polysaccharides and proteins. The process of this invention also includes selection of a nucleophile or bis nucleophile which will react with the activated polysaccharide to form a covalently modified polysaccharide with pendant electrophilic sites or pendant thiol groups, thereby obviating the need to further functionalize the bis nucleophile modified polysaccharide prior to reacting the covalently modified polysaccharide with the covalently modified protein. Also, the functionalization of the protein to either moiety form may be accomplished in more than one step according to the selection of reactants in these steps. In the first step toward covalently modifying the polysaccharide, the solid polysaccharide must be solubilized. Since the nucleophilic alcoholic hydroxyl groups of a polysaccharide cannot compete chemically for electrophilic reagents with the hydroxyls of water in an aqueous solution, the polysaccharide should be dissolved in non aqueous non hydroxylic solvents. Suitable solvents include dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylacetamide, formamide, N,N dimethylimidazolidinone, and other similar polar, aprotic solvents, preferably dimethylformamide. In addition to the use of these solvents, Applicants have found that converting the polysaccharides of their invention e.g., the capsular polysaccharides of Partially hydrolyzed Subsequent steps are then directed to overcoming the other significant physico chemical limitation to making covalent bonds to polysaccharides, that being the lack of functional groups on the polysaccharides, other than hydroxyl groups, which are reactive enough with reagents commonly or practically used for functionalization of units with which bonding is desired. Activation of the polysaccharide to form an activated polysaccharide, reaction with bis nucleophiles to form a nucleophile functionalized polysaccharide, and functionalization with reagents generating either electrophilic sites or thiol groups, are all directed to covalently modifying the polysaccharide and developing functional groups on the polysaccharide in preparation for conjugation. In the next step, the solubilized polysaccharide is activated by reaction with a bifunctional reagent at about 0 50 C, while stirring for ten minutes to one hour, with the crucial weight ratio of activating agent to polysaccharide in the range of 1 5 to 1 12. In the past, this activation has been accomplished by reaction of the polysaccharide with cyanogen bromide. However, derivatives activated with cyanogen bromide, which has a proclivity for vicinal diols, have shown transient stability during dialysis against a phosphate buffer. Therefore, while activation with cyanogen bromide is still possible according to the present invention, this reagent is poorly utilized in activation of polysaccharides and is not preferred. Instead, preferred bifunctional reagents for activating the polysaccharide include carbonic acid derivatives, Carbonyldiimidazole, a particularly preferred reagent, will react with the hydroxyl groups to form imidazolylurethanes of the polysaccharide, and arylchloroformates, including, for example, nitrophenylchloroformate, will produce mixed carbonates of the polysaccharide. In each case, the resulting activated polysaccharide is very susceptible to nucleophilic reagents, such as amines, and is thereby transformed into the respective urethanes. In the next stage, the activated polysaccharide is reacted with a nucleophilic reagent, such as an amine, particularly diamines, for example, An activated polysaccharide, when reacted with a diamine, e.g., 1,4 butanediamine, would result in a urethane form polysaccharide with pendant amines, which may then be further functionalized by acylating. Mixed carbonates will also readily react with diamines to result in pendant amine groups. Alternatively, the activated polysaccharide may be reacted with a nucleophile, such as a monohaloacetamide of a diaminoalkane, for example, 4 bromoacetamidobutylamine see, W. B. Lawson The last step in preparing the polysaccharide, the further functionalization, if necessary, of the polysaccharide, may take the form of either reacting the nucleophile functionalized polysaccharide with a reagent to generate electrophilic i.e., thiophilic sites, or with a reagent to generate thiol groups. Reagents suitable for use in generating electophilic sites, include for example, those for acylating to α haloacetyl or α halopropionyl, derivative such as Reagents suitable for use in generating thiol groups include, for example, acylating reagents, such as thiolactones, e.g., By these steps then, covalently modified polysaccharides of the forms, Ps A E Separate functionalization of the protein to be coupled to the polysaccharide, involves reaction of the protein with one or more reagents to generate a thiol group, or reaction of the protein with one or more reagents to generate an electrophilic i.e., thiophilic center. In preparation for conjugation with an electrophilic functionalized polysaccharide, the protein is reacted in one or two steps with one or more reagents to generate thiol groups, such as those acylating reagents used for generating thiol groups on polysaccharides, as discussed on pages 15 17 above. Thiolated proteins may also be prepared by aminating carboxy activated proteins, such as those shown in Atassi When E B is In preparing for conjugation with a covalently modified bacterial polysaccharide with pendant thiol groups, the protein is acylated with a reagent generating an electrophilic center, such acylating agents including, for example, Formation of the conjugate is then merely a matter of reacting any of the covalently modified polysaccharides having pendant electrophilic centers with any of the proteins having pendant thiol groups at a pH of 7 to 9, in approximate equiweight ratios, in a nitrogen atmosphere, for from six to twenty four hours at from about 17 to 40 C, to give a covalent conjugate. Examples of such reactions include Similarly, any of the covalently modified polysaccharides with pendant thiol groups may be reacted with any of the proteins having pendant electrophilic centers to give a covalent conjugate. An example of such a reaction is Should the electrophilic activity of an excess of haloacetyl groups need to be eliminated, reaction of the conjugate with a low molecular weight thiol, such as n acetylcysteamine, will accomplish this purpose. Use of this reagent, n acetylcysteamine, also allows confirmation accounting of the haloacetyl moieties used see Section D , because the S carboxymethylcysteamine which is formed may be uniquely detected by the method of Spackman, Moore and Stein. These conjugates are then centrifuged at about 100,000 X G using a fixed angle rotor for about two hours at about 1 to 20 C, or are submitted to any of a variety of other purification procedures, including gel permeation, ion exclusion chromatography, gradient centrifugation, or other differential adsorption chromatography, to remove non covalently bonded polysaccharides and proteins, using the covalency assay for the bigeneric spacer see below as a method of following the desired biological activity. The further separation of reagents may be accomplished by size exclusion chromatography in a column, or in the case of very large, non soluble proteins, such as Analysis of the conjugate to confirm the covalency, and hence the stability of the conjugate, is accomplished by Applicants by hydrolyzing preferably with 6N HCl at 110 C for 20 hours the conjugate, then quantitatively analyzing for the amino acid of the hydrolytically stable spacer containing the thioether bond and constituent amino acids of the protein. The contribution of the amino acids of the protein may be removed, if necessary, by comparison with the appropriate amino acid standard for the protein involved, with the remaining amino acid value reflecting the covalency of the conjugate, or the amino acid of the spacer may be designed to appear outside the amino acid standard of the protein in the analysis. The covalency assay is also useful to monitor purification procedures to mark the enhancement of concentration of the biologically active components. In the above examples, hydrolysis of One or more of the conjugates of this invention may be used in mammalian species for either active or passive protection prophylactically or therapeutically against bacteremia caused by the cognate organism, such as, in the preferred embodiments of this invention, In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the conjugate is used for active immunogenic vaccination of humans, especially infants and children. For additional stability, these conjugates may also be lyophilized in the presence of lactose for example, at 20 µg ml of H. flu polysaccharide 4 mg ml lactose or 50 µg ml of pneumococcal polysaccharide 10 mg ml lactose prior to use. A preferred dosage level is an amount of each of the conjugates or derivative thereof to be administered corresponding to 25 µg of polysaccharide in the conjugate form for conjugates of pneumococcal polysaccharides and 10 µg of polysaccharide in the conjugate form for conjugates of H. flu type b polysaccharide in a single administration. If necessary, an additional one or two doses of conjugate or derivative thereof of the The invention is further defined by reference to the following examples, which are intended to be illustrative and not limiting. The salts and soy peptone were dissolved in small volumes of hot, pyrogen free water and brought to correct final volume with additional hot, pyrogen free water. The fermenters or flasks were then sterilized for about 25 minutes at 121 C and after cooling, yeast extract diafiltrate 1 , glucose 2 , NAD 3 , and hemin 4 were added aseptically to the flasks or fermenters prior to inoculation. The fermentation was maintained at 37 C with 100 rpm agitation and monitored by optical density O.D. and pH determinations until a typical O.D. of 0.39 was reached after about 5.5 hours . Approximately 40 liters of the product of C Stage was used to inoculate an 800 liter fermenter containing 570 liters of production medium prepared as described above , scaled to the necessary volume and 72 of UCON LB625 antifoam. The fermentation was maintained at 37 C with 100 rpm of agitation, with the O.D. and pH levels being checked about every two hours until the O.D. was similar for a two hour period, at which time the fermentation was terminated a typical final O.D. was .54 after 12 hours. . Approximately 600 liters of the batch was inactivated by harvesting into a kill tank containing 12 liters of 1 thimerosal.

The following procedures were used in performing the assays 360 ml of fresh Dowex 50X8 200 400 mesh strong acid cation exchange resin Bio Rad was charged to a sterile chromatography column and washed with 1500 ml of sterilized, distilled sd water and soaked overnight in 800 ml of sd water. The resin was then sequentially washed with one liter of 60 40 sd water methanol, one liter 40 60 sd water methanol, and one liter of sd water. The resin was then sterilized by soaking in 650 ml of 3N hydrochloric acid 200 ml HCl, diluted to 800 ml with water . This acid form resin was aged 19.5 hours and then washed free of excess acid with H₂O. To this column was then added 700 ml of a 1 1 mixture of water 40 tetrabutylammonium hydroxide, which was percolated through the resin until the effluent was basic pH 10 . The resin was washed free of excess base with approximately 2 liters of water and then transferred to a sterile jar. The final effluent was sterile and pyrogen free. A 250 ml round bottom flask fitted with a magnetic stirrer was charged with 3.29 g of HIb and 84 ml of water. The mixture was stirred for 20 minutes and then an additional 15 ml of water was added. Stirring was continued for an additional 30 minutes until all HIb was in solution. The HIb solution was then applied to 150 ml of Dowex 50X8 200 400 mesh, tetrabutyl ammonium form in a 45 mm X 270 mm column. Ten ml of water was used as a rinse. The column was topped with water and pressure was applied with a hand pump through a Millex FG .22 µ filter . Fifty ml fractions were collected in sterile Nalgene centrifuge tubes 50 ml and each tube was assayed for organic material by applying an approximately 10 µl aliquot, using a sterile melting point capillary, to a silica gel plate.

The flask was capped and the solution was stirred at room temperature for 35 minutes. During this time, 32 ml of the butane diamine solution prepared in A was charged to a 100 ml round bottom flask containing a magnetic stir bar and stirred in an ice bath for about 5 minutes. After the 35 minute stir time, the DMF solution was added, with a pipet, to the cold 1,4 butane diamine solution.

To a 6 ml serum vial containing 42 mg ethylene diamine tetracetic acid and 8 mg dithiothreitol, gas added 5 ml of pH 11.3 borate buffer. 3.8 ml of the above solution was charged to a 50 ml round bottom flask and 11.5 ml of a solution of The flask was capped with a mushroom type serum stopper and the air replaced by nitrogen using a Firestone valve ACE Glass Co. . 53 mg of N acetylhomocysteine thiolactone was added in a nitrogen box, and the resultant solution was aged in the N₂ atmosphere at room temperature for 16.7 hours. This solution was then applied to a column containing 120 ml of Sephadex G25 fine , which was operated in the nitrogen box. Elution was with pH 8 phosphate buffer and 5 ml fractions were collected and assayed by the Ellman test for thiols. Baseline separation of high molecular weight i.e., protein thiol from lower molecular weight material was effected. The high molecular weight fractions were combined and added to one of the 50 ml flasks containing 0.06 g of HIb BuA₂ BrAc section IV .
