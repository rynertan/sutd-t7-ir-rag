# REMOTE SENSOR TELEMETERING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A telemetering system for remotely measuring a physical parameter of an object such as a human or animal includes a sensor device including a tuned cir cuit and a sensor device coupled for altering the figure of merit of energy storage Q of the tuned circuit in response to variations in the physical parameter, and an indicator unit for transmitting a signal to intermit tently ring the tuned circuit with a burst of oscillating electromagnetic energy and sense the resultant ring signal generated by the tuned circuit. The indicator unit measures the rate of decay of the sensed ring signal after the end of each transmitted eergy burst as a measure of the Q of the tuned circuit. The indicator unit includes a microprocessor which generates a mea sure of the rate of decay and then computes the meas ure of the physical parameter according to a prestored functional relationship between the physical parameter measure and the decay rate of sensed ring signal. The computed measure is then displayed in a display de vice. A phase locked loop circuit in the indicator unit is coupled to alter the phase and hence the frequency of the transmitted signal to be in phase with the reso nant frequency of the tuned circuit. The decay rate may be measured by generating a ratio of peak voltage values sampled at two different but predefined times after the sensed ring signal begins decaying.
