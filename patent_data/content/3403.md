# Thermally insulating, fire resistant material and its production.

## Abstract
The invention relates to thermally insulating, fire resistant material and its production. A problem associated with fire resistant material comprising refractory material and a binder is the tendency, in use, of the material to disintegrate due to bond failure. In the invention, hollow particles of a glass or of a ceramic are combined with a binder to give a material where the proportions of binder are such that the material is capable of deformation at high temperatures e.g. up to 1100 C without fracture or loss of cohesion. A specific example consists of 93 by weight of hollow spherical particles of pulverised fuel ash and 7 by weight of sodium silicate binder. The material is particularly useful in the protection of steel structures.
