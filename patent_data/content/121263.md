# A method for removing polymer scale deposited on reactor walls and a polymer scale removing agent therefor.

## Abstract
The invention provides an efficient method for removing polymer scale deposited on the walls of the polymerization reactor after completion of a polymerization run of an ethylen ically unsaturated monomer, e.g. vinyl chloride, in an aque ous medium. The polymer scale adhering to the walls is soaked with a scale remover solution containing a soluble cellulose derivative, such as ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose and the like, applied thereto and, after stand ing as wet for a while, washed down easily with water. Certain additives to the solution, e.g. acids, alkalis, paraffins and emulsifying agents, may further enhance the effectiveness of the remover solution.
