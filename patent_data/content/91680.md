# Magnetic bubble device using thulium containing garnet.

## Abstract
Certain tm containing iron garnet compositions provide layers having desirably low values of temperature coefficient of bubble collapse field and permit the fabrication of 1.2 µm diameter magnetic bubble devices. The compositions, based on Tm substitution on dodecahedral sites of La,Bi , Sm,Eu ,R ₃ Fe,Al,Ga ₅O₁₂, are grown by liquid phase epitaxy onto suitable substrates. Bubble devices that incorporate the layers find applications in high density information storage.
