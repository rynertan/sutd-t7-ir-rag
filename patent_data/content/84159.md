# Sensing device for human lung exhalation inhalation air flow measurement.

## Abstract
A spirometer is provided having an air flow path 32 with a housing 24 extending between the ends of a container 12 . A paddle wheel rotor 42 rotates within a cavity and partially cuts across the flow path to define an air gap. The ratio of the cross sectional area of the air gap to the inlet to the flow path is approximately 1 3. A light source detector 80 is activated by a chopper wheel 72 coaxially mounted with the rotor 42 and adapted to rotate therewith. The detector 80 generates a train of pulses proportional to the rotation of the rotor 42 which in turn is proportional to the volume of air flowing through the air path 32 .
