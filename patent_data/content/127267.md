# Disposable dispenser for dispensing contaminatable and non contaminatable liquids.

## Abstract
A disposable self contained manifold type multiple stroke dispenser is provided which has sufficient capacity for dispensing 96 microliter quantities of liquid without refill to accommodate a standard 96 well microtitration plate 30 . It comprises a rigid manifold 20 and a plunger assembly 22 removably mounted on an annular collar 78 defining a fill port for the manifold. The latter has a set of dispensing tips 24 uniformly spaced apart in a straight row along the bottom of the manifold for simultaneously dispensing liquid samples into a row of wells 28 of the microtitration plate 30 upon actuation of the plunger assembly 22 .
