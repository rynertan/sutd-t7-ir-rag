# Electrothermal atomiser.

## Abstract
An electrothermal atomiser comprises a graphite tubular member 1 which is clamped between two pairs of graphite contact members 3,5 . The contact members are provided with semicircular grooves 14,22 between which the tubular member is clamped with a sufficient force to flex the wall of the tubular member to conform to the profile of the grooves. This arrangement improves the electrical contact between the tubular member 1 and the contact members 3,5 as contact over an area is provided rather than point or line contact.
