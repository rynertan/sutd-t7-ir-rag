# Pulse width control circuit in which a feedback amount is vaired depending upon an operating temperature.

## Abstract
In a pulse width control circuit, particularly in an electronic ignition system for an automobile engine, the timing and width of output pulses, e.g. ignition current pulses, is controlled by comparing a signal responsive to input pulses, e.g. pulses synchronized with the engine s rotation, with a comparison level. According to the invention said comparison level is automatically varied in response to an operating temperature, e.g. the engine temperature, thereby ensuring uniform production of output pulses without pulse gaps in both the low speed low temperature and high speed high temperature ranges of the engine.
