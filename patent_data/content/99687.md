# A mould assembly for casting metal articles and a method of manufacture thereof.

## Abstract
The application relates to a mould assembly 10 includ ing a plurality of individual moulds. Presently such assemb lies are made by joining smaller wax patterns together and coating the assembly with ceramic. The layered structure of the ceramic produced by this process can cause flaking and parts of the assembly cannot be replaced if one is faulty. In addition, for casting directionally solidified parts ceramics of greater refractoriness are required. The mould assembly 10 of the present application is made by separately transfer moulding a starter base 16 , a plurality of moulds 12 , a downpole 14 and pouring cup 19 , providing each with mechanical locking features, such as screw threads, and joining them together into the assembly. Much greater flexibility is thereby achieved in materials and wall thicknesses which can be different in different parts of the assembly to suit strength and heat transfer requirement, individual bits can be replaced, and the transfer moulding produces a compact homogeneous cera mic structure.
