However, these compounds can be prepared as enantiomeric mixtures containing both the active and inactive epimers. This invention encompasses the enantiomeric mixture, as well as any other composition containing the isomers with the absolute configuration specified above. The ss lactams of formula I have activity against a range of gram negative and gram positive organisms. The compounds of this invention can be used as agents to combat bacterial infections including urinary tract infections and respiratory infections in mammalian species, such as domesticated animals e.q,, dogs, cats, cows, horses, and the like and humans, For combating bacterial infections in mammals a compound of this invention can be administered to a mammal in need thereof in an amount of about 1.4 mg kg day to about 350 mg kg day, preferably about 14 mg kg day to about 100 mg kg day.All modes of administration which have been used in the past to deliver penicillins and cephalosporins to the site of the infection are also contemplated for use with the novel ss lactams of this invention.

The compounds of formula I wherein R2 is aryl can be prepared from an azetidine having the formulaEMI12.1 wherein Y is a leaving group such as iodine or toluenesulfonyloxy and A1 is a nitrogen protecting group, e.g., benzyloxycarbonyl, triphenylmethyl or t butoxycarbonyl. Reaction of a compound of formula II with the appropriate phenolic compound having the formula III R2 E wherein R2 is aryl, in the presence of base, e g., sodium hydride, yields the corresponding compound having the formulaEMI13.1 Introduction of the sulfo substituent onto a compound of formula IV yields a compound having the formulaEMI13.2 This is accomplished by reacting a compound of formula IV with a complex of pyridine and sulfur trioxide.The reaction can be run in an organic solvent or in a mixture of organic solvents, preferably a mixture of a polar solvent such as dimethylformamide and a halogenated hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane. This reaction yields a compound of formula V wherein Ms is pyridinium ion. Instead of using a pre formed complex of pyridine and sulfur trioxide, the complex can be formed in situ, e.g., using chlorosulfonyl trimethyls ilyl ester and pyx iodine as reagents. Alternatively, a complex of dimethylformamide sulfur trioxide, 2 pico line sulfur trioxide or 2,6 lutidine sulfur trioxide can be used.

To prepare those products of formula I wherein R2 is NH2 CH2 n a compound of formula X wherein R2 is alkoxycarbonylalkyl is selectively reduced using, for example, a chemical reducing agent such as sodium borohydride to yield a compound having the formulaEMI21.2 The hydroxyl group of a compound of formula XX can be converted to a leaving group by reaction with a reagent such as g toluenesulfonyl chloride and then reacted with sodium azide to yield a compound having the formulaEMI21.3 Hydrogenation of a compound of formulaXXI followed by protection of the resulting amino group yields the corresponding compound having the formulaEMI22.1 wherein A3 is a nitrogen protecting group.It is important that A1 and A3 be different protecting groups. Introduction of a sulfo substituent to the l position of a compound of formulaXXII can be accomplished using the procedures described above for the introduction of a sulfo substituent onto a compound of formula IV. The resulting compound has the formulaEMI22.2 Deprotection of the 3 amino group of a compound of formula XXIII followed by acylation of the resulting compound yields a compound having the formula EMI23.1 Deprotection of the amino group in the 4 position yields the desired product of formula I.

Removal of the amino protecting group from a compound of formula XXVII followed by acylation yields the desired product of formula I wherein R is methoxy. An alternative synthesis for preparing the compounds of formula I wherein R is methoxy utilizes a compound having the formulaEMI24.2 as a starting material A1 is preferably benzyloxycarbonyl . Halogenation of a compound of formula XXVIII yields the corresponding compound having the formula EMI25.1 Methoxylation of a compound of formula XXIX followed by reduction with a reagent such as trimethylphosphite yields an intermediate having the formulaEMI25.2 A sulfo group can be introduced in the l position of a compound of formula XXX using the abovedescribed techniques. Removal of the nitrogen protecting group, followed by acylation, yields the desired product of formula I whereinR is methoxy. In the above methoxylation procedures, when R2 is KH2 CH2 n , , it will also be necessary to protect and deprotect the free amino group.
