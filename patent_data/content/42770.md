# Method of immobilizing nuclear waste in glass.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a method of immobilizing nuclear waste in glass. A composition is prepared of 60 to 100 of a hydrolyzed glass forming silicon compound and up to about 40 of a glass forming aluminum compound. About 1 to about 50 liquid nuclear waste and up to about 10 solid nuclear waste is mixed into the composition. The composi tion is heated to about 200 to about 500 C to drive off water and organics, with the resulting vitreous product totally containing the nuclear waste. Finally, this product can be sintered at about 800 to about 900 C to reduce porosity, or worm pressed into block form.
