# Hot water tank with reduced heat loss.

## Abstract
The outlet fitting 5 of the hot water tank is connected to a pipe 7 by way of a nipple 6 including an internal damper 8 . This is constituted by a sleeve 9 having sector shaped flaps 10 integrally hinged to it by hinge portions 11 . In a no flow standby condition, the flaps 10 extend transversely across the sleeve 9 to close off the fitting 5 and prevent hot water heat loss by convection. During periods of water flow, the flaps are pivoted to a dotted line open position to permit water flow through the fitting with minimum restriction.
