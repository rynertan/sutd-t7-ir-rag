# Method and apparatus for continuous casting of metal.

## Abstract
A continuous centrifugal casting machine employs a rotat ing water cooled mould in which a tubular mould cavity 18 is formed by a number of pallet conveyors 30 , each having a flight defining a part cylinder. The conveyors 30 are driven so that pallets 32 thereof form the tubular mould which moves with the casting, thus eliminating relative movement between the mould and the casting. The conveyors 30 are housed in side a rotating drum 22 so that centrifugal force causes molten metal, such as steel, poured against the wall of the mould cavity at one end to form a comparatively thin walled tube which exits from the other end of the mould cavity 18 . The tube may be helically slit to form sheet.
