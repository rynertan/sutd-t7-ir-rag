# Apparatus for generating a velocity profile for movement of a body by a servo system.

## Abstract
A servo system generates a velocity profile for moving a body eg a magnetic disk file actuator arm from one position to another by dividing the time during which the body is moving into a plurality of segments, each segment being one half as long as the preceding segment. For each segment the same predetermined number of desired velocity values are stored and used to control the velocity of the moving body. This results in increasing resolution of the velocity wave as the body approaches its desired position, while not requiring excessive storage capacity for storing the desired velocity values.
