# Ceramic honeycomb body.

## Abstract
A ceramic honeycomb body 1 has a plurality of through holes 4 defined by partition walls 2 so as to be separated from each other, and fins 3 are integrally formed with selected partition walls 2 so as to extend into the through holes 4 surrounded by such selected partition walls 2, whereby the cross sectional area of the through hole 4 is selectively reduced by the fins 3 thus provided.
