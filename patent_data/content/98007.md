# Enclosed disk drive with improved air filtration system.

## Abstract
A disk drive assembly 10 includes an internal air filter 14 which is placed adjacent to but downstream from, the actuator assembly area 13 thereby to pass air which has been decelerated from the rotating disk 11 and passed through the actuator assembly area 13 to the rotating disk 11 while simultaneously filtering this air to remove parti cles. By passing through the actuator assembly area 13 the air cools the actuator assembly and removes certain particles from this area as it is filtered.
