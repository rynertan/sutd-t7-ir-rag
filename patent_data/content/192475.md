# AUTOMATIC CLOSING ACTIVATOR

## Abstract
A temperature actuated traction device comprises an element 30 of a heat responsive memory material, to respective ends of which are connected two relatively movable parts 13, 16 . One part 13 is connected to a load which is to be displaced relatively to the other part 16 to cause a change in shape of the ductile element 30 when cold. Heating means is provided to cause heating of the element 30 to restore it to its original shape whereby a restoring force is applied to the displaced load, and a spring 20 is provided to allow yielding of the other part 16 under traction applied to the load when the element 30 is hot.
