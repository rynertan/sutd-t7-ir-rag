# DYNAMIC ADDRESSING FOR VARIABLE TRACK LENGTH CACHE MEMORY

## Abstract
A data storage system includes a host computer 10 and magnetic disk units 26 of diverse types. A solid state cache memory 30 stores data records at addresses which are generated by a microprocessor 40 in the cache manager 32 . These addresses include a beginning of track address and an end of track address which span a frame having enough memory locations to store an entire track for a particular type of disk unit 26 .
