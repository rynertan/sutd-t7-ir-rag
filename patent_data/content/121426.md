## Description
This invention relates to an erasable optical recording medium capable of erasing previously recorded information or recording new information while erasing previously recorded information, and a method of optical recording and erasing using the same medium, and more particularly to an optical recording medium capable of sufficiently recording information and erasing the recorded information with a light source of small energy and a method of optical recording and erasing using the same medium. The quantity of information to be recorded and reproduced has been tremendously increasing in recent years, and there is a keen demand for an innovative method capable of recording and reproducing at higher speed and higher density as compared with conventional information recording and reproducing methods. In this regard, current attention has been directed to various methods of recording and reproducing the information optically. Typical examples of hitherto proposed methods in this field are as follows. As a first example, a recording method reported by D. Maydan, The Bell System Technical Journal, Vol. 50, No. 6 1971 , pp. 1761 1788, involves the use of a thin film about 0.1 µm of a low melting point metal such as In or Bi formed on a glass or plastic substrate. When a laser beam is applied to the metal thin film in very tiny spots about 10 µm or smaller in diameter , tiny cavities are formed in the illuminated spots through the absorption of light, the rise in temperature and resultant fusion, and displacement and or evaporation of the metal. Thus, the illuminated spots become transparent or translucent, so that an optically reproducible and permanent image is formed. As a second example, U.S. Patent No. 3,636,526 proposes the use of an amorphous semiconductive material, more specifically a calcogenide not containing oxygen, as typified by Ge₁₅Te₈₁Sb₂S₂, As₂S₃ and As₂₀Se₆₀Ge₂₀. When light such as a laser beam is applied to a thin film of such material, there occurs a change in the bonding state of the atoms of the material as a result of a temperature increase by absorption of light, so that the thin film exhibits a change in the optical density in the illuminated area. By this change in optical density, the information is recorded. As a third example, U.S. Patent No. 3,983,542 discloses facilitating the transfer from a low optical density state an amorphous state to a high optical density state a crystalline state by adding halogen, iodine, bromine, oxygen, steam, alkaline metal element, sulfur, selenium, tellurium or others to a base recording material. Our US 3,971,734 and FR 2242744 and GB 1457470 discloses a recording material having a thin film of a mixture of a an oxide or suboxide of tellurum and b a vanadium oxide or a suboxide of lead. By irradiation with visible light, e.g. a laser, or infrared radiation, the optical density of the film is increased so as to make a recording. Our US 4,278,734 and DE 2,933,253 A discloses an erasable recording medium wherein the photosensitive component is a thin film of a a suboxide of a metal or semimetal of group IIIB, IVB, VB or VIB of the periodic table, e.g. of Te, Ge, Sn and or Si or of Bi, Sb, Tl and or In and b up to 50 mole of S and or Se not as an oxide , and which can be formed by vacuum evaporation of the mixture. Recording is made by visible or near infrared rays to cause local darkening of the film and a recording can easily be erased by further such irradiation with light of sufficient energy. Our JP A 58 54338 discloses a recording medium in which elemental TE is dispersed in stoichiometric oxides, such as GeO₂, SiO₂ and SnO₂. The present invention has as its principal object the provision of an optical recording medium having a photosensitive layer capable of recording information, and of erasing the recorded information and recording other information,repeatedly and satisfactorily. It is another object of the invention to provide an optical recording medium capable of recording and erasing repeatedly and satisfactorily with an excellent resistance to humidity, not deteriorating in a short time if left exposed in the atmosphere. It is a further object of the invention to provide an optical recording medium in which a high optical density state and a low optical density state are respectively retained in a stable state. It is still another object of the invention to provide an optical recording medium which may be manufactured easily by a vacuum deposition or sputtering method. It is a still further object of the invention to provide a method of recording information optically by using the optical recording medium of this invention. According to the invention we provide an optical recording medium having a support and a layer of photosensitive composition whose optical density varies reversibly when irradiated with light, the composition comprising The invention also provides an optical recording medium having a support and a layer of photosensitive composition whose optical density varies when irradiated with light, the composition comprising The invention further provides an optical recording medium having a support and a layer of photosensitive composition whose optical density varies when irradiated with light, the composition comprising In particular, in order to vary the optical density with a small light energy, the content of the second element is set somewhere between 10 and 30 mol . When the first element is Te and the second elements are Sn and Ge, the contents z₁ and z₂ of Sn and Ge are set respectively within 10 mol z₁ 30 mol and 0 z₂ 10 mol . In this case, the value of The optical density of the medium varies when it is irradiated with light. Thus the invention also provides a method of optical recording which comprises imagewise irradiating said photosensitive layer of the medium of the invention with light of relatively high energy density and of a wavelength which cause an increase in optical density of the layer the recording can be erased by reversing the change in optical density by further irradiation with light of lower energy density. A laser beam is suitably used for irradiation. In its various embodiments, the light irradiating conditions when applying light energy to the photosensitive layer are determined to satisfy the following expressions In one embodiment, to satisfy said irradiation conditions, the laser beam is reduced to a circular spot when varying the optical density of the photosensitive layer from a high state to a low state, and the beam is widened to a slender elliptical form when changing the optical state of the layer from a low state to a high state. In another embodiment, the photosensitive layer is formed on a rotary disc, and the disc rotating speed is higher when changing from a high density to a low density than when changing from a low density to a high density. This invention provides various advantages, among which are as follows. The invention will be better understood and appreciated, along with other objects and features thereof, from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the drawings. Referring now to FIG. 1, an optical recording medium is generally indicated by numeral 10, which is composed of a base 11, a thin film photosensitive layer 12, and a protective layer 14. Examples of usable materials for the base 11 include metal such as aluminum and copper, glass such as quartz, pyrex and soda glass, synthetic resin such as ABS resin, polystyrene, PMMA polymethyl methacrylate as one kind of acrylic resin, polyvinylchloride, and transparent film such as acetate, poly tetrafluoro ethylene , polycarbonate and polyester. Among others, when a polycarbonate film, polyester film or PMMA plate is used, the transparency is excellent and it is effective to optically produce the formed signal images. The thin film photosensitive layer 12 is formed on the base 11 by a vacuum deposition or sputtering method. This photosensitive layer 12 has the composition of said components a and b or a , b and c defined above. The protective layer 14 is formed on this thin film photosensitive layer 12 to protect the photosensitive layer. As this protective layer 14, the same material as the base 11 may be used, and this material may be adhered by using an ultraviolet curing resin or by vacuum deposition. The photosensitive layer 12 may include a said suboxide for example TeO The individual internal structures and functional mechanism of these compositions are not fully elucidated, but at least two models may be considered. The first model is a mixture of an oxide such as TeO₂, Sb₂O₃ and a semimetal or metal such as Te or Sb, which are mixed in extremely small particles of size about 20 Å 10 Å 1mm . The second model is a composition not containing a semimetal or metal, e.g. a composition represented by TeO Based on these models, the recording principle for the blackening transition of said composition may be assumed as follows. In the case of compositions represented by TeO These changes are theoretically reversible, but it was conventionally relatively difficult to return the optical constants n and k , changed to the darkened or blackened state, to the original values, that is, to return the reflectivity and transmission to the initial values. It appears that the particles of metal or semimetal in the composition, once increased in size, cannot be restored to the initial small particles. In general, in order to increase the size of fine particles, it is necessary to heat the substance to its melting point in a short time and then to slowly cool or to keep the temperature near the melting point for a long period. To reduce the size, in contrast, it is necessary to heat the substance once over the melting point to fuse the substance and then suddenly cool to freezing while the particles are small in size. However, for instance, in the case of compositions represented by TeO To solve these problems, it is intended to enhance the reversibility of the particle size of the thin film of the composition by adding a substance to satisfy at least one of the following conditions in the thin film. As a result of experiments, it was found that the particle size can be changed reversibly when at least one of said second additives, capable of satisfying at least one of the conditions stated above, is added to the thin film of said composition in a state where at least part of such substance is not an oxide. The substances of the above group, generally, have large light absorption, large thermal conductivity as a single element, and a distinct melting point and boiling point. When they are bonded with fine particles of metal or semimetal to form said composition, it is easier to control the melting point, boiling point and vapor pressure of said composition. Accordingly, they are considered to be useful for facilitating the reversible changes of the optical characteristics of the composition. In addition, these substances are easy to handle in a vacuum deposition or sputtering process, and it is easy to form a thin film. However, as will be mentioned later, the number, kind and quantity of the substances to be added and selected from the above group varies depending on the kind of a composition represented by MO Incidentally, when Ge was added to the composition, the state of low optical density, after quick cooling of the thin film of the composition following irradiation with a laser beam, was very stable, and the effect was to considerably improve the storability of recorded signals. This seems to be because the tendency of fine particle to increase in size is drastically weakened when Ge particles are bonded with fine particles of metal or semimetal existing in the composition, thereby preventing the fine particles from growing in size if heated to some extent. The addition of metal or semimetal elements, such as Sb, Tl, Bi, Sn or In, Cu, to the composition seems to suitably enhance the stability of the recording or erasing state and to improve the reversibility. Thus, by adding a plurality or metals or semimetals, differing in effects, to the composition, the recording and erasing characteristics of the thin film of the composition may be freely adjusted. The thin film of the composition usually presents a pale brown color when freshly formed by vacuum deposition, and turns to a dark brown color this phenomenon being called darkening or blackening to vary in the optical density when provided with a light energy at a relatively weak power and a relatively long pulse width. When the darkened or blackened thin film is provided with a light energy at a relatively strong power and a relatively short pulse width, in contrast, the optical density is lowered this phenomenon being called whitening . Reversible changes are thereby created. The composition represented by MO For example, in a composition including TeO The methods of forming said thin film photosensitive layer 12 by vacuum deposition using one vacuum deposition source will now be explained. FIG. 2 illustrates a vacuum deposition apparatus used for this purpose. The degree of vacuum in the vacuum apparatus 16 is between 133 mPa and 0.133 mPa 10 ³ Torr to 10 ⁶ Torr . For example, as one vacuum deposition source, that is, as a raw material 18 for vacuum deposition, an oxide M When stable quartz, alumina, ceramic, platinum, etc. is used for the container 20 for heating and vacuum deposition, the raw material may be further blended with a powder of a reducing agent R Fe, Cr, W, etc. , and the container 20 may be heated by a coil heater 30. The heating temperature is selected within the range of 600 C through 1,000 C. Another method is to form a thin film photosensitive layer by vacuum deposition on the base by evaporating simultaneously from two sources. FIG. 3 shows a vacuum deposition apparatus used in this process. The degree of vacuum of a vacuum deposition apparatus 32 should be selected within the range of 10 ³ through 10 ⁶ Torr. An oxide M Further increasing the sources, it is also possible to evaporate and form simultaneously from three sources, for example, M Meanwhile, when the content x2 of the second element which is contained in the thin film photosensitive layer exceeds 50 mol , generally, a greater power for whitening is required of the light source, for example, the laser beam. There is also a method of forming a thin film photosensitive layer containing two second elements M In the vacuum deposition, by setting the rate of vacuum deposition from each source according to the design of the thin film composition, shutters 90, 92, 94 and 96 are opened when reaching the target value, and a thin film photosensitive layer containing additive substances M Instead of the vacuum deposition, it is also possible to form a thin film photosensitive layer on a base by a high frequency sputtering method. For instance, oxides such as M It was found that the contents of the second elements in the thin film photosensitive layer vary the recording and erasing characteristics of the thin film significantly, as will be explained later. As stated above, the thin film photosensitive layer obtained by the above stated method generally presents a pale brown color, though somewhat different according to the types of additives. When this photosensitive layer is irradiated with a light energy of a relatively long pulse width and a relatively weak power, the optical density turns to a dark brown color, which is referred to as a darkening or blackening phenomenon. When this darkened or blackened photosensitive layer is irradiated with a light energy of a relatively strong power and a relatively short pulse width, the dark portion returns to the original pale brown color, which is referred to as a whitening phenomenon. Using a laser beam, for example, when the thin film photosensitive layer is alternately irradiated with light of mutually different conditions by properly varying the irradiation power and irradiation duration, the optical density of the layer may be repeatedly increased and decreased blackened and whitened . Generally, however, as the content of the second element increases, the laser irradiating duration for darkening or blackening becomes shorter, and the power of a laser beam necessary for whitening increases. To the contrary, when the content of a second element decreases, it is found that the irradiation duration of a laser beam for darkening or blackening becomes longer while the power of a laser beam for whitening decreases. In short, an increase of the content of a second element makes the darkening or blackening easy and whitening difficult, whereas a decrease of the content of a second element makes the darkening or blackening difficult and whitening easy. By properly determining the content of a second element, therefore, it is possible to produce an optical recording thin film photosensitive layer having recording and erasing characteristics suited to the conditions of use of the recording medium, laser power, rotating speed, or disc diameter. Generally speaking, when the content of the second element obtained in the thin film photosensitive layer exceeds 50 mol , the power of the laser beam for whitening increases. More specifically, when using a semiconductor laser with maximum output of about 25 mW, which is a light source for small output power, it is found that the characteristics of repeatedly recording and erasing are excellent in the content range of the second element within 10 to 30 mol , so that a thin film photosensitive layer capable of darkening or blackening and whitening satisfactorily may be obtained. This, however, does not necessarily hold true when Te is used as the second element, and a sufficient reversibility was recognized even when its content was 70 mol . When the content of Te as the second element was selected within the range of 10 through 70 mol , a sufficient reversibility was obtained. Referring now to FIGS. 5 to 8, methods of recording, reproducing and erasing information on said optical recording member are explained. On said optical recording member, information may be recorded, reproduced and erased by using, for example, a xenon flash lamp, He Ne gas laser, or semiconductor laser. Relating first to a recording method by use of a xenon lamp, the process is explained in reference to FIG. 5 . A thin film photosensitive layer for optical recording 98, having light absorbing characteristic which was explained in FIGS. 1 to 4, is formed on a substrate 100 to make an optical recording medium, and a mask 102 having patterns 102a locally differing in the light transmission is tightly mounted on the medium. When illuminated by a xenon lamp 104 from above, the exposed portion 98a of the medium is darkened or blackened, and a contrast image 98a corresponding to the pattern is formed on said photosensitive layer 98. In this case, the emission width of the xenon lamp 104 is relatively long, about 1 msec, and it is difficult to whiten the darkened or blackened portion by using this lamp. But it is possible to whiten this darkened or blackened portion by other means such as a gas laser and semiconductor laser. A recording method by use of a gas laser is now explained with reference to FIG. 6. A laser beam source 106 may be, for example, a He Ne laser λ 632.8 nm , He Cd laser λ 441.6 nm , or Ar laser λ 514.5 nm . A laser beam 108 is emitted from a laser tube 106 and undergoes an intensity modulation depending on the signal in a modulator 110, such as an electro optical modulator or ultrasonic modulator, and is formed into a spot by a focusing lens 114 through a mirror 112. The laser beam 108 is applied to the optical recording medium at a light intensity corresponding to the signal. The medium comprises the base 118 and the thin film photosensitive layer 116 disposed thereon having light absorbing characteristics. By the relative movement of the light beam and the optical recording medium, signals are sequentially written on said recording medium. FIG. 7 shows the use of a semiconductor laser λ 830 as a laser light source. Since a semiconductor laser generally emits beams of a relatively wide spread angle of about 20 degrees, a spot is formed by using two lenses. The beam emitted from the semiconductor laser 120 is changed to a quasiparallel light 124 by a first lens 122 and is focused to a spot light 128 by a second lens 126. Then the laser spot light 128 is applied to the optical recording medium which comprises a base 132 and thin film photosensitive layer 130 having light absorbing characteristics, at a light intensity corresponding to the signal. When a semiconductor laser is used, internal modulation is easy, unlike the case wherein a gas laser is used, and an optical modulator is not necessary. The illuminated portion of the thin film photosensitive layer 130 is darkened or blackened, and the information is recorded as a change in the optical density. When a laser is used, the intensity or pulse width of the laser beam may be freely selected by modulating it. Therefore, when information is recorded on a whitened photosensitive layer, the information may be recorded by darkening or blackening, using a light of relatively weak and long pulse width, and the recorded information may be erased by whitening, using a light of relatively intense and short pulse width. When information is recorded on a darkened or blackened photosensitive layer, the information may be recorded by whitening, using a light of relatively intense and short pulse width, and the recorded information may be erased by darkening or blackening, using a light of relatively weak and long pulse width. Thus, either method may be employed. At this time, it is necessary to set the irradiating light power density P mW µm₂ and irradiating light pulse width τ nsec properly. In the thin film photosensitive layer for optical recording, the darkening or blackening light irradiating power density P Relating now to methods of reproducing the thus recorded signals, the thin film photosensitive layer presents a pale brown color in the unrecorded state and when information is recorded, by darkening or blackening, turns dark in the recorded state. The optical density is increased, while the reflectivity varies at the same time. To read out recorded information signals, either light transmission type reproduction or light reflection type reproduction may be possible as shown in FIGS. 8 and 9. First referring to FIG. 8, the transmission type reproduction method is explained. As an illuminating light source 134, a tungsten lamp, He Ne laser, semiconductor laser, light emitting diode or the like may be used. The light from this light source 134 is reduced to a spot 138 by a focusing lens 136, and the information signal image 140 which is recorded on the photosensitive layer 139 is illuminated from the back side. The transmitted light from the optical recording medium 141 passes through a lens 142 to become a detected light 144, which enters a photosensitive diode 146. The intensity of the detected light 144 is reduced to about 1 2 through 1 10 when the signal image 140 is illuminated as compared with that in the no signal state. Thus the signal is reproduced by detecting the difference in intensity of the transmitted lights. FIG. 9 shows the reflection type reproduction method. A laser beam 148 passes through a half mirror 150 and, thereafter, is focused by a focusing lens 152 and reduced into a spot light 154. The spot light 154 illuminates the signal image 159 on the photosensitive layer 157 of optical recording medium 155. The light reflected from the optical recording medium 155 passes back through the lens 152 and is reflected by the half mirror 150, and is focused by a focusing lens 154 to enter a photosensitive diode 156, from which a reproduction signal is produced. The present invention is further described below by referring to various embodiments of the thin film photosensitive layer. Tellurium oxide TeO₂ and an alloy of tellurium and tin Te₈₅Sn₁₅ was used as sources of starting materials for vacuum deposition, and a thin film was formed by using a two source evaporation apparatus as shown in FIG. 3. A quartz crucible was used as a heating and evaporating boat, and coil heaters were used to produce heat. A thin film photosensitive layer of about 120 µ m in thickness represented by TeO The thin film photosensitive layer obtained in this process has a pale brown color. When this photosensitive layer was irradiated with a pulse of light for 200 nsec by using a semiconductor laser of λ 830 nm, the illuminated area of the photosensitive layer turned to a dark brown color at a power density of 0.6 mW µm² or more. When this darkened or blackened portion is irradiated with a short pulse of light for 40 nsec at an irradiation power density of 5 mW µm², the illuminated area was whitened to return to the original state. The spectral transmission curve of this photosensitive layer indicated a transmission of over 20 in the vicinity of the semiconductor laser wavelength of 0.8 µm as shown in curve a₁ in FIG. 10. The spectral transmission curve in the darkened or blackened recorded state of this thin film photosensitive layer, as indicated by curve a₂, was greatly decreased. Therefore, within the wavelength range of a semiconductor laser, a ΔT, or difference in transmission between darkening or blackening and whitening, of over 20 may be obtained. Recording and erasing occur due to the difference between the curves a₁ and a₂. A similar effect was obtained when In, Ge, Zn, Tl, Bi or Cu was used as a second element instead of Sn. A bismuth oxide Bi₂O₃ and an alloy of bismuth and tellurium Bi₅₀Te₅₀ were used as starting materials of evaporation, and a photosensitive layer represented by BiO When this thin film photosensitive layer was irradiated with a pulse light for 200 nsec by use of a semiconductor laser with wavelength of 830 nm, the photosensitive layer turned to a grayish brown color at a power density of 0.5 mW µm² or more. When this darkened or blackened portion was irradiated with a pulse light for 40 nsec, the illuminated portion was whitened at a power density of 4 mW µm² or more, and thereby returned to the original state. The spectral transmission curve in the whitened state of this thin film photosensitive layer was shown by curve d₁ in FIG. 11, and that in the darkened or blackened state was shown by curve d₂, and the change in transmission between darkened or blackened state and whitened state, that is, the quantity of change of writing in the vicinity of a semiconductor laser wavelength of 0.8 µm, was ΔT 10 . When other second elements, such as Ge, Sn, In, Zn, Tl, Bi, Pb, Al or Cu were used instead of Te, similar effects could be obtained, but the effect of Te was particularly high. Similarly, with the combination of Sb₂O₃ and Sb₅₀Te₅₀ and Tl₇₅Te₂₅, or In₂O₃ and In₅₀Te₅₀, thin film photosensitive layers represented by BiO FIGS. 11 and 12 show the respective spectral transmission curves before and after darkening or blackening, wherein d₁, e₁, f₁ and g₁ refer to the whitened state, and d₂, e₂, f₂, and g₂ relate to the blackened state. In individual films the state changes from d₁ to d₂, e₁ to e₂, f₁ to f₂, g₁ to g₂, and vice versa. These films, when compared with the thin film photosensitive layers which contain a composition represented by TeO Also in the case of thin film photosensitive layers including compositions represented by BiO It is also possible to vary the sensitivity and Δ T or writing change quantity, by combining several materials of embodiments 1 and 2. When three evaporating sources, TeO₂, Te and Sn, are used as the starting materials, a thin film photosensitive layer was formed by using a four source type evaporating apparatus as shown in FIG. 4. As a heating and evaporating boat, a copper crucible was used, and the sources were directly heated by an electron beam to form a thin film photosensitive layer represented by TeO The thin film photosensitive layer obtained in this method had a pale brown color. When this photosensitive layer was irradiated with a laser beam by use of a semiconductor laser having a wavelength of 830 nm, the layer was darkened when the power density of the laser beam irradiation was greater than 0.6 mW µm², and its reflectivity R increased to about double the reflectivity R The darkened or blackened region of the thin film photosensitive layer, which was irradiated with a laser beam having a power density of 0.8 mW µm², was further irradiated with a laser beam of enhanced power density. The illumination region was whitened at a power density of over 5 mW µm², and the reflectivity returned to the original level. FIG. 14 shows the results of the investigation of the difference in the whitening characteristics according to the content of Sn when the thin film photosensitive layer was irradiated with a laser beam at a power density of 6 mW µm², in which k, l and m correspond to a Sn content of 20, 10 and 5 , respectively. From this graph, it is shown that the laser beam irradiation duration required to whiten the thin film photosensitive layer represented by TeO FIG. 15 describes the spectral transmission and spectral reflectivity of the same thin film at a Sn content of 10 mol , wherein o₁ and p₁ refer to the transmission and reflectivity in the whitened state and o₂ and p₂ are those in the darkened or blackened state. As evident from this graph, in the vicinity of a semiconductor laser beam wavelength of 830 nm, a transmission change Δ T of over 20 and a reflectivity change ΔR of about 10 may be obtained. Recording and erasing occur due to repeated changes between these two states. When TeO₂, Te and Ge as the starting materials were used, a thin film photosensitive layer represented by TeO By use of the four source vacuum deposition apparatus shown in FIG. 4, several trial thin film photosensitive layers TeO The above stated four sources, Te, TeO₂, Sn and Ge, were simultaneously evaporated on a base to form a thin film photosensitive layer represented by TeO FIG. 17 shows the results of the investigation of changes in the transmission in an atmosphere of temperature 50 C and relative humidity 90 RH, relating to the thin film photosensitive layer represented by TeO When the former photosensitive layer was taken out after the lapse of 100 days and was irradiated with a semiconductor laser beam, it reached the saturation of darkening or blackening in about 500 nsec at an irradiating power of 1 mW µm². When this darkened portion was irradiated with a pulse light for about 50 nsec at a power of 7 mW µm², the irradiated portion was whitened. By the use of In, Tl, Bi, Cu or Sb as the second elements instead of Sn or Ge, experiments similar to those in embodiments 3 and 4 were made. As a result, a pale brown colored thin film photosensitive layer was obtained in all cases. In these photosensitive layers, darkening or blackening and whitening phenomena were recognized when the content z of the second element was according to 0 z 50 mol . Especially in a range of 10 z 30 mol , the recording and erasing performance could be confirmed in a disc form by the use of a method which will be explained in embodiment 10 below. Of these substances, In and Bi presented effects similar to those of Sn. It was found that Bi and In contributed to enhance the light absorption rate of the photosensitive layer, and at the same time, control the rate of darkening or blackening by varying the content thereof. The second element Sb was effective to increase the transmission without varying the darkening or blackening temperature. For instance, Sb was useful for increasing the transmission variation ΔT in a recording and reproducing system to detect penetrating light. Meanwhile, a photosensitive layer containing Tl as a second element was found to be extrememly high in recording and erasing sensitivity. Three sources, Bi₂O₃, Bi and Te, were used as the starting material for vacuum deposition, the rate thereof was set at 5 Å sec, 10 Å sec, and 2 Å sec, respectively. A thin film photosensitive layer represented by BiO When this thin film photosensitive layer was irradiated with pulsive light for 200 nsec by the use of a semiconductor laser with a wavelength of 830 nm, it turned to a grayish brown color at an irradiating power density of about 0.5 mW µm². When this darkened region was irradiated with pulsive light for 40 nsec, the irradiated portion was whitened and returned to the original pale color at an irradiating power density of over 4 mW µm². In FIG. 11, d₁ and d₂ are the curves of the spectral transmission in the whitened state and darkened or blackened state, respectively, of this thin film photosensitive layer. In the BiO The second element or elements acted almost the same as observed in the previous embodiments of GeO Similar to the method used with respect to the BiO FIGS. 11 and 12 show the spectral transmission curves in the whitened state d₁, e₁, f₁ and g₁ and in the blackened state d₂, e₂, f₂ and g₂. When the thin film photosensitive layer of BiO These photosensitive layers were similar to the TeO The content of Te could be selected within the range of 10 through 70 mol . In the case of SbO When these second elements were combined with Te, or with both Te and Ge, both the variation and stability were improved. It was found that Te was very effective for its absorption while Ge was very effective for the stability of the whitened state. At the time, the maximum practical content of Ge was about 10 mol , and the darkening or blackening was difficult at a higher content. Regarding the total content of the second elements, reversibility was recognized at a maximum of 70 mol . Thin film photosensitive layers of BiO Using a four source type of vacuum deposition apparatus such as shown in FIG. 4, two of the four sources were TeO₂ and Te and the other two were selected from Ge, Bi, Sn, Sb, and In and TeO In these layers, darkening or blackening and whitening changes were recognized with a total content of the second elements of 50 mol or less. It is also possible to vary the characteristics by using more elements. The following examples relates to production of a thin film by a sputtering method. FIG. 18 is a plan of a disc shaped target 4 inches in diameter and 5 mm in thickness used in the sputtering process. A target main body 158 is composed of TeO₂ of which sector plates of Te 160 and Sn 162 are arranged at a surface area ratio of TeO₂ Te Sn equal to 2 2 1. In this state, sputtering was continued for 10 minutes in an argon Ar gas atmosphere, and a pale brown colored thin film was obtained. When this film was irradiated with a semiconductor laser beam with a wavelength of 830 nm for 500 nsec at an irradiating power density of 0.8 mW µm², the irradiated portion was blackened. When this blackened portion was irradiated for 50 nsec at a power density of 7 mW µm², the irradiated portion returned to an original pale color state. In the embodiments explained so far, at least part of the second element exists in the photosensitive layer in a non oxide state, and at least part of the second element is present in the photosensitive layer in a metal or semimetal state. Further, at least part of the second element forms an intermetallic compound for example, Te Ge together with part of the first element within said photosensitive layer. Still, at least part of the first element forms an oxide of stoichiometric composition when the first element has the maximum valence in a stable state. Referring then to FIG. 19, a method of recording and erasing the information on the recording medium of this invention by using two semiconductor lasers differing in the spot length is described below. An optical information recording medium is formed into a disc 164, 200 mm in diameter. The optical system on the left side is for whitening and reproducing. The light emitted from a semiconductor laser 166 for whitening is changed to quasiparallel light 170 by a first lens 168, shaped into a circle by a second lens 172, changed again to parallel light 176 by a third lens 174, reduced to a wavelength of about 0.8 µm by a fourth lens 180 through a half mirror 178, and focused into a circular spot 182. The irradiation by this circular spot light on the surface of disc 164 rotating at a speed of 1800 rpm provides the same effect as when a pulse light of relatively high power density and relatively short irradiation time is applied. Therefore, if the recording film is preliminarily blackened, a whitening signal 186 may be recorded on a blackened track 184 by laser modulation. The signal may be detected by a photosensitive diode 194 through a lens 192 which receives a reflected light 188 from the disc 164 through the half mirror 190. The right side optical system is for blackening. The beam 196 emitted from a laser for blackening is changed to a quasiparallel light 206 by a third lens 204 a mirror 208 changes the direction of the quasiparallel light 206 , and is transformed into a slender oval spot light 212 by a fourth lens 210 which is projected on the disc surface. When the longitudinal direction of this slender spot light is adjusted to match the rotating direction of the disc, the same effect is obtained on the disc surface as when irradiated with a pulse light of relatively weak irradiating power density and relatively long irradiation time. Therefore, the photosensitive layer may be blackened at the same rotating speed as used with a whitening spot light. In this embodiment, a thin film photosensitive layer of TeO This example is a method of recording, erasing and reproducing by use of a semiconductor laser. The same disc as in embodiment 11 was used, and the same semiconductor laser and optical system as in embodiment 11 were used here for whitening and reproducing. The method of recording by whitening on a preblackened disc was the same as that in embodiment 11. In FIG. 19, the light emitted from the semiconductor laser was similarly reduced to a spot of about 0.8 µm diameter on a recording plane of the disc which was rotating at 1800 rpm, and the irradiated portion was whitened. The recorded signal was reproduced, as in the case of the previous embodiment, by irradiating with a laser beam with the power lowered to about 0.5 mW µm². To erase the whitened signal, i.e., recorded signal, the disc rotating speed was lowered, for instance to 300 rpm, and a laser beam was applied to the disc at a power density of about 1 mW µm². As a result, the recorded portion was blackened, that is erased.
