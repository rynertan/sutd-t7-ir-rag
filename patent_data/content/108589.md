# CHARGE ELECTRODE MEANS FOR AN INK JET PRINTER

## Abstract
The invention provides charge electrode means for an ink jet printer, comprising a pair of members 1 , which are preferably planar members of electrically insulating material, mounted in spaced relation to one another so as to provide a gap 2 between opposed surfaces 3 thereof, opposed charge electrode layers 7 of electrically conductive material on said opposed surfaces 3 , and means 4 electrically connecting said opposed charge electrode layers 7 .
