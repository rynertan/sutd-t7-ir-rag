# A BOOM ELEMENT FOR A FLEXIBLE FLOATING BARRIER USABLE IN SHALLOW OR TIDAL WATERS AND A METHOD OF CONTAINING POLLUTANTS IN SUCH WATERS

## Abstract
A flexible floating barrier or boom for containing the spread of oil and other pollutants floating in shallow tidal waters comprises a flexible buoyancy tube 1 and two jux taposed flexible ballast tubes 2 . The buoyancy tube is dis posed above and intermediate the ballast tubes and is joined in contiguous relation with the latter. The buoyancy tube may be inflated with air or plastics foam material whilst the ballast tubes are filled with water so that the boom floats with the buoyancy tube projecting above the surface of the water and the ballast tubes below the surface. A weighted skirt 4 depends from the buoyancy tube between and below the ballast tubes. In tidal waters, when the tide ebbs, the boom settles onto the sea or river bed in an erect position and the ballast tubes seal against the bed so that polluted water may be contained behind the boom.
