# Technique for verifying genuineness of authenticating device.

## Abstract
A given type of authenticating device operates as a diffractive subtractive color filter that exhibits a reflectivity spectrum that includes a peak occurring at a wavelength that varies as a substantially linear function of the angle of incidence of polychromatic illuminating light having a parti cular polarization. The verification technique involves simul taneously illuminating a sample device at 200 over a range of angles of incidence α₁ α₂ by the polychromatic light 230 , and then employing the light 232,234,242 reflected from the sample to illuminate a reference device at 202 which is known to be genuine over the same range of angles of incidence α₁ α₅, α₂ α₆ . A sample device is indicated as being genuine only if both the respective ratios of the intensity 13 of light 244 reflected from the reference device to the intensity 11 of the illuminating polychromatic light and to the intensity 12 of light reflected from the sample device exceed respective threshold values.
