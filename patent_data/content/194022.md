# Safety coupling device for robotic tooling.

## Abstract
A coupling device 25 includes a first support member 28 which is connected to the arm 18 of a robot 15 and which supports a second support member 44 for universal tilting and axial movement from an aligned normal position. The second support member supports robotic tooling 26 . A set of springs 72 and balls 58 coupled by pins 56 to the second support member, bias the support members to the normal position. The balls normally engage associated contact plates 61 carried by the first support member 28 , and the balls and their associated contact plates are connected in series to an electrical control circuit. The circuit is effective to stop movement of the robot arm when any ball separates from its contact plate in response to minute tilting or axial movement of the second support member in the event the tooling or article carried by the tooling is accidentally hit or overloaded.
