## Description
The present invention relates to a microbiological process for producing peroxidase. More particularly, the invention relates to a process for producing a novel peroxidase from a microorganism of a new genus Peroxidase is an enzyme that oxidizes a variety of compounds in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Currently, peroxidase is used as a clinical or diagnostic reagent in combination with a variety of oxidases for the assay of glucose, cholesterol, phospholipids and uric acid. Another current use of peroxidase is as a marker enzyme in enzyme immunoassay. The only commercially available sources of peroxidase are plants such as horseradish and Japanese radish. Since the peroxidase originating from such plants contains isozymes of slightly different properties, they must be separated laboriously in order to obtain a pure form of peroxidase suitable for use as a diagnostic reagent. The present inventors made various efforts to obtain from fast growing microorganisms a peroxidase that is comparable to the conventional peroxidase derived from horseradish or Japanese radish in that it can be used either as a clinical or diagnostic reagent or as a marker enzyme in enzyme immunoassay. To attain this object, the inventors isolated a large number of naturally occurring microorganisms and examined their ability to produce peroxidase that develops color with the aid of a hydrogen donor such as a 4 AA phenol system, MBTH DEA system or ABTS. As a result, the inventors have found a strain of microorganism belonging to a new genus that produces peroxidase in a high yield. The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of this finding. The strain disclosed by the present invention has the following mycological properties. Smear preparations and slide cultures of the strain of the invention on several culture media were prepared for observation of the process of conidium formation and appearance of conidiophores and conidia. Conidiophores are difficult to discern from vegetative hyphae. The process of conidium formation is of thallic type. The formation of a conidium starts with the cutting off of the tip of the hypha from the base portion. The residual hypha is then fragmented either in the center or at the point slightly above the center to form a conidium. At the same time, a new shoot of a hypha arises from the side of the residual hypha immediately beneath the cut plane, and another conidium is formed by the process just described. This process is repeated to form conidia, sometimes yielding a spherical cluster of conidia at the terminal of a hypha. The hypha arising from the side of the residual hypha immediately beneath the cut plane may sometimes continue to grow. The conidia are in the form of short cylindrical with rounded ends. Hyaline. The surface of conidia is smooth. Diameter in the range of 3.8 6.0 x 1.5 2.5 µm. The pH range that enables the growth of the microorganism disclosed by the present invention is from 4 to 10, with the optimum range being 6 9. The growth temperature is in the range of 10 45 C, with the optimum range being 30 40 C. Noting that the mycological properties of the microorganism disclosed by the present invention are characterized by the thallic type of conidiogenesis, the inventors referred to W. B. Kendrick and J. W. Carmichael, Hyphomycetes in The Fungi, vol, IVA Ainsworth, G.C. et al eds. and to J. W. Carmichael, W. B. Kendrick, I. L. Conners and L. Sigler, Genera of Hyphomycetes, for finding a genus to which the microorganism of interest would belong. However, the inventors were unable to locate a specific genus that included a microorganism having morphological characteristics identical with those of the strain of interest. The inventors therefore concluded that the strain would appropriately be classified as belonging to a new genus of Type species The strain just described was isolated from the soil. The strain used in the present invention may be cultured by inoculating a liquid or solid medium with spores or hyphae from the strain or a liquid seed culture obtained by precultivation. A liquid medium may contain any common carbon sources such as glucose, fructose, xylose, saccharose, maltose, soluble starch, molasses, glycerol and mannitol. Usable nitrogen sources include naturally occurring substances such as peptone, yeast extract, malt extract, meat extract, casamino acids, and corn steep liquor, as well as organics such as urea, and inorganics such as sodium nitrate and ammonium nitrate. Inorganic salts e.g. phosphates, magnesium sulfate, iron sulfate and copper sulfate and vitamins may optionally be used as trace nutrient sources. Any of these components may be incorporated in a medium in any concentration that will not be detrimental to the growth of the microorganism of interest. For practical purposes, carbon sources are generally used in concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10 wt , preferably from 1 to 5 wt , while nitrogen sources are in the range of 0.01 to 5 wt , preferably 0.1 to 2 wt . The cultivation temperature ranges from 10 to 45 C, preferably from 30 to 40 C. The medium is adjusted to a pH value in the rnage of 4 10, preferably 6 9, and cultivation is conducted by agitation culture under aeration, shake culture or stationary culture, for a period which generally lasts 3 to 14 days. A solid medium may be prepared from wheat bran, rice hulls, rice bran or any other suitable materials that are mixed with 50 100 wt of water. Cultivation is carried out at temperatures between 10 and 45 C, preferably between 30 and 40 C, for a period of 3 14 days. If necessary, the medium may be supplemented with suitable nitrogen sources, inorganic salts or trace nutrient sources. For mass cultivation, a liquid medium is preferred. The culture obtained by the procedures described above has peroxidase accumulated therein. The term culture used here means either the cultured cells, the culture supernatant, the mixutre thereof or a culture filtrate if a liquid medium is used if a solid medium is used, the term culture means the mixture of the cells and the medium on which they have grown. For example, if a liquid medium is used, peroxidase may be recovered from the culture mixture by the following procedures. When the full growth of the organism is attained, the culture mixture is subjected to a suitable solid liquid separation means such as cetrifugation or filtration, so as to obtain a crude enzyme solution free from the cells and insoluble matter. Peroxidase in the cells may be extracted by disrupting them by a suitable method such as grinding or ultrasonic treatment. Cells may be directly subjected to an ultrasonic treatment in a culture medium so as to disrupt the cells and a crude enzyme solution may be obtained by removing any insoluble matter from the treated solution. If cultivation is performed on a solid medium, a crude enzyme solution may be obtained by the following procedures water is added to the solid medium containing the cultured cells, and any insoluble matter is removed from the mixture either immediately or after disrupting the cells by a suitable means such as ultrasonic treatment. A pure form of peroxidase may be isolated from the crude enzyme solution by conventional enzyme purification techniques, such as organic solvent fractionation, ammonium sulfate fractionation, dialysis, isoelectric precipitation and column chromatography, which may be used either independently or in combination. The activity of the peroxidase in accordance with the present invention may be determined by the following method, wherein a 4 AA phenol system, for example, is used as a hydrogen donor. First, 1.3 ml of 0.1 phenol solution, 0.25 ml of 0.2 4 AA solution and 0.2 ml of 0.02 hydrogen peroxide solution are added to 1 ml of 0.1M phosphate buffer pH, 7.0 and the mixture is prewarmed to 37 C. To the pre warmed mixture, 0.25 ml of a specific enzyme solution is added and subjected to reaction for 10 minutes. After the reaction, 0.2 ml of 20 sodium azide solution is added and the absorbance of the mixture is measured at 500 nm to obtain a reaction value, which is compared with a control value obtained by the same procedure except that the hydrogen peroxide solution is replaced by an equal volume 0.2 ml of water. One unit U of peroxidase activity is indicated as the amount of oxygen that oxidizes 1 micromole of 4 AA phenol per minute. The activity U ml of peroxidase in an enzyme solution or culture solution is determined by the formula 0.198 x 0.D.₅₀₀ x the dilution rate of the enzyme or culture solution , wherein 0.D.₅₀₀ is the absorbance value after subtracting the control value. The peroxidase obtained by the present invention has the following properties. The peroxidase in accordance with the present invention catalyzes the oxidation of various compounds in the present of hydrogen peroxide by the mechanism shown below wherein AH₂ is a hydrogen donor, and A is an oxidized hydrogen donor . The specificity of the peroxidase for a variety of hydrogen donors is shown in Table 1. The optimum pH range at which the peroxidase exhibits the highest activity was checked by using samples having the same formulation as used for the assay of peroxidase activity in above 1 , except that different buffers were used for different pH ranges 0.1M acetate buffer for pH 3.5 5.5, 0.1M phosphate buffer for pH 5.5 8.0, 0.1M tris HCl buffer for pH 7.5 9.0, and 0.1M glycine sodium hydroxide buffer for pH 8.5 9.0. The results are summarized in Fig. 1. The activity of the peroxidase was measured over the temperature range of 10 80 C, and the results are shown in Fig. 2. Different buffers were used for different pH ranges 0.1M acetate buffer for pH 3.5 5.0, 0.1M phosphate buffer for pH 6.0 8.0, 0.1M tris HCl buffer for pH 8.0 9.0, and 0.1M glycine NaOH buffer for pH 9.0 12.0. 0.9 ml of a specific buffer solution was added to 0.1 ml of the peroxidase solution and the mixture was left to stand at 30 C for 16 hours. The so treated enzyme solution was diluted 10 fold with 0.02M phsophate buffer pH, 7.0 and the activity of the enzyme was measured. The results are shown in Fig. 3. Samples each prepared by adding 0.1 ml of the enzyme solution to 1.9 ml of 0.02M phosphate buffer pH, 7.0 were held at varying temperature 20 90 C for 30 minutes. Immediately thereafter, the samples were cooled with iced water for 10 minutes and the residual enzyme activity in each sample was measured. The results are shown in Fig. 4. Analysis by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the peroxidase in accordance with the present invention had a molecular weight of about 36,000. The peroxidase was found to have an isoelectric point of 3.4 as a result of isoelectric focusing at 900 volts for 40 hours using Amphorite Pharmacia as a carrier pH, 3 10 . The analytical data of the peroxidase of the invention is summarized in Table 2. The analytical data suggest that the peroxidase in accordance with the present invention is novel and characterized by the absence of isozymes. Because of the absence of isozymes, this peroxidase is particularly useful as a marker enzyme in enzyme immunoassay. Thus, in place of horseradish peroxidase used in the method by Avrameas Immunochemistry, The following Examples are provided for further illustration of the invention. Ten milliliters of a medium pH, 6.0 containing 1 glucose, 0.5 polypeptone, 0.3 yeast extract and 0.3 malt extract was put into a test tube having a diameter of 24 mm, and sterilized at 120 C for 15 minutes. The sterilized medium was inoculated with one loopful of Five liters of a medium pH, 6.0 containing 1 glucose, 0.5 polypeptone and 0.3 yeast extract was charged into a 15 liter jar fermenter and sterilized by heating at 120 C for 40 minutes. The sterilized medium was inoculated with 200 ml of a liquid preculture of Three liters of a medium having the same composition as used in Example 1 was divided into 30 equal volumes, which were distributed among the corresponding number of 500 ml culture flasks, and sterilized by heating at 120 C for 20 minutes. A liquid preculture 10 ml of The peroxidase in accordance with the present invention has no isozymes present and is more suitable than the conventional peroxidase of plant origin as a clinical and diagnostic reagent or a marker enzyme in enzyme immunoassay. The peroxidase of the invention is produced from a microorganism, so it has the additional advantage of being supplied consistently in large quantities.
