# MEASURING DEVICE FOR SURFACE AND SUBSURFACE DEFECTS IN METAL BODIES ABOVE THE CURIE TEMPERATURE

## Abstract
The sensor is constituted by a magnetic core with pole pieces and by an electric coil wound on the body of said core. With said coil there are associated a sinusoidal current generator and impedance measurement means. A processor determines the presence of surface and subsurface defects in metal bodies above the Curie temperature.
