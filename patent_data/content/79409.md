# Improvements in scraper chain conveyors.

## Abstract
Attachment of a scraper member such as a flight bar 14 to a scraper conveyor chain 2 moving in pans 12 is effected by means of a land 42 formed on an extension 36 of the flight bar seating in a chain link 44. The driving force of the chain is transmitted to the flight bar through the land and no loading is transmitted to a retaining finger piece 50 bolted to the flight bar using a square headed bolt 34 captive against a shoulder on the flight bar. The retaining finger piece is symmetrical and hence reversible. In another embodiment, a short saddle piece serving as a race cleaner and chain support may also be secured to the chain by means of a land co acting with the chain and retained on the chain by means of retaining pins.
