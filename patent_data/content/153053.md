## Description
This invention relates to video display apparatus comprising a display device including a plurality of display cells arranged in an X Y matrix. A video display device such as the Sony Jumbotron in which display cells are arranged in a 2 dimensional X Y matrix form and the display cells are respectively driven by desired data to display a desired picture is known. We have proposed as a display cell usable in such a video display device the following. Referring to Figures 1 to 4 of the accompanying drawings, these show a front view of a luminescent display cell, a sectional view taken on line A A of Figure 1, a sectional view taken on line B B of Figure 1 and a partially cut away perspective view of the cell. The cell comprises a glass envelope 1 comprising a front panel 1A, a rear plate 1B and a side wall 1C. Within the glass envelope 1 are disposed a plurality of luminescent display segments 2 2R, 2G, 2B , a plurality of cathodes K K The wire cathodes K are each stretched between a pair of conductive support members 6 and 7 which are disposed on respective side portions of the rear panel 1B. One support member 6 is for fixing one end of each wire cathode K, while the other support member 7 is provided with a spring portion 7a to which is fixed the other end of each wire cathode K. With this arrangement, an even extension of the wire cathode K due to a rise of temperature would be absorbed by the spring portion 7a, and thus the wire cathode K never becomes loose. The first grids G On the other hand, a separator 10 formed of a conductive material is disposed to surround the display segments 2R, 2G and 2B. The separator 10 not only serves as a shield for preventing secondary electrons 31 see Figure 6 induced by impingement of electron beams 30 from the wire cathodes K on the first or second grid G₁ or G₂ from rendering an adjacent display segment 2 luminous, but also serves to form a diffusion lens which functions to spread the electron beam 30 from each wire cathode K so that the electron beam 30 is radiated throughout the corresponding display segment 2. In addition, the separator 10 is used as power supply means for supplying a high voltage, for example 10 KV, to each display segment 2. In assembling, the separator 10 is supported between the front panel 1A and a side wall 1C of the glass envelope 1 and fixed by frit. More specifically, as shown in Figure 7 of the accompanying drawings, the separator 10 is in the form of a frame partitioned in threes to surround the display segments 2, and on first opposed upper ends thereof are formed outwardly projecting supporting pieces 11, while on the other opposed upper ends are formed anode leads 12 for the supply of high voltage anode voltage . Furthermore, on the side portions of the separator 10 are formed outwardly bent resilient positioning pieces 13. When the separator 10 is inserted from above into the inside of the side wall 1C, as shown in Figure 8 of the accompanying drawings, the supporting pieces 11 abut the upper end face of the side wall 1C thereby to support the separator 10, and at the same time the bent portions 13 abut the inner surface of the side wall 1C thereby to position the separator 10 in central fashion. Also provided on the upper end portion of the separator 10 are inwardly bent lugs 14 each having a projection 15 formed on the surface thereof. When the front panel 1A is placed and sealed on the side wall 1C after enclosing the separator 10 in the side wall 1C, the projections 15 contact the carbon layer 3 or the metal back layer 5 see Figure 9 of the accompanying drawings . As a result, the high voltage from the anode leads 12 is fed in common to the display segments 2R, 2G and 2B. In an assembled state, the anode leads 12 to which are applied the high voltage are taken out to the exterior through the sealed portion between the front panel 1A and the upper end face of the side wall 1C, while the leads of the wire cathodes K, the first grid G₁ and the second grid G₂ are taken out to the exterior through a sealed portion between the rear plate 1B and the side wall 1C. The leads of the cathodes K, the first grids G₁ and the second grid G₂ are brought out together for supporting purposes. For example, in each of the first grids G The glass envelope 1 is provided by sealing the front panel 1A, the side wall 1C and the rear plate 1B with respect to each other by frits 22 see Figure 9 . To the rear plate 1B a chip off pipe 21 for gas exhaust is fixed by frits. Operation of the above display device will now be explained. An anode voltage of, say, 10 KV or so is supplied through the anode leads 12 to the red, green and blue display segments 2R, 2G and 2B. To each of the first grids G Such a luminescent display device can be made thin. Moreover, the low voltage side leads such as the cathode and first and second grid leads are taken out from the rear plate 1B side of the glass envelope 1, while the high voltage side anode leads 12 are taken out from the front panel 1A side. Therefore, possible dangers during discharge and wiring can be avoided, thus ensuring a stable luminescent display. Moreover, since the anode voltage applied separator 10 surrounds each display segment 2, a diffusion lens is formed by the separator 10. Therefore, even if only the first grids G₁ are curved and the second grid G₂ is flat as shown in Figure 6 , the electron beam 30 from the wire cathode K spreads laterally in the direction of the slits 8 and 9 and is radiated to the entire surface of the display segment 2. At the same time, the secondary electrons 31 from the first or second grid G₁ and G₂ are obstructed by the separator 10, so the adjacent cut off display segment 2 is not rendered luminous. In the case of a colour display for example, in the case of a 9300 Since the wire cathodes are used with a temperature restriction, that is, the loading of the oxide cathode is set at a ratio of one to several tens to prevent a reddish appearance, the number of electrons emitted per cathode is small. One method of solving this problem might be substantially to enlarge the surface area of oxide by winding a tungsten wire spirally, for example. But, in the case of a long spiral, it is likely that there will occur loosening or vibration of the cathode. In view of this, a construction as shown in Figures 10 and 11 of the accompanying drawings has been proposed. In this example, a core 35 formed of a high temperature material such as, for example, tungsten or molybdenum, is provided, and its surface is coated with an insulating material 36 such Al₂O₃. Then tungsten wire 37 serving as a heater is wound spirally thereon and an electron emissive material 38, for example carbonate, is bonded to the spiral portion by spraying or electrodeposition to form a directly heated cathode 34. The core 35 is fixed at one end thereof to one support member 6 and at the other end thereof to the spring portion 7a of the other support member 7 by spot welding or other suitable means, it being stretched under tension. The tungsten wire 37 is fixed between one support member 6 and a second support member 6 on the other side by spot welding or other suitable means. Thus, in the above construction, the cathode is wound spirally onto the core 35 coated with the insulating material 36, and the core 35 is stretched by the spring portion 7a, whereby problems such as shorting between spiral portions and thermal deformation of the spiral can be eliminated. Moreover, the oxide surface area is substantially increased, and a uniform temperature distribution area A with reduced temperature difference between the ends and the centre of the cathode becomes wider. As a result, the number of electrons emitted can be increased, and as a whole, therfore, it is possible to increase the amount of allowable current per cathode. The curve I in Figure 11 represents a temperature distribution. Thus, the luminescent display device is formed. In this case, since the separator supplied with the same high voltage as that applied to the display segments is positioned to surround the plurality of display segments, a diffusion lens is formed whereby an electron beam from the cathode is spread laterally and radiated to the entire surface of each display segment or element. Consequently, it is possible to make a high luminance display. Moreover, by the presence of the separator, secondary electrodes from a control electrode or accelerating electrode are obstructed, not rendering the adjacent cut off display segment luminous, and thus a stable luminescent display can be effected. When a picture display apparatus is formed by using the above luminescent display devices, the following assembly method is used. A plurality of the above luminescent display devices or cells 40, for example, 6 column x 4 row 24 luminescent display cells 40 are incorporated in a unit case 41 to form one unit as shown in Figure 12 of the accompanying drawings. Then, a plurality of the above unit cases 41 are arranged in an X Y matrix form, for example, 7 column x 5 row 35 to form a block and then five blocks are arranged laterally to form a sub module. Then, a plurality of the sub modules are combined in an X Y matrix form, for example, 9 column x 4 row 36. By using a plurality of the sub modules, a jumbo sized picture display apparatus of, for example, 25 m column x 40 m row can be constructed. In this case, the number of the display cells 40 is Figures 13A and 13B of the accompanying drawings are respectively a front view and a cross sectional view of the whole of a built up jumbo sized picture display apparatus. The whole of this jumbo sized picture display apparatus is a building which is, for example, 42 m in height and 47 m in width. The upper portion of the building is made as a display portion which is provided with nine floors, each floor having a height of 2.688 m. On each floor there are located four sub modules in the lateral direction. Moreover, on the lower portion of the building there may, for example, be formed a stage for entertainments, an anteroom, and a central control room for operating and managing the display apparatus and the stage. In this case, since twenty four luminescent display cells 40 form a unit and a plurality of units are employed to assemble the whole picture display device, the display device becomes easy to handle and also easy to assemble. In this case, each unit is formed as a 40 cm square shape. In such a picture display apparatus, when the display signal for each display cell 40 is transmitted, it is impossible to perform the signal transmission in parallel for about 450,000 picture display segments 2. Thus, the signal transmission is carried out by a scanning method. In this case, however, the structure of the display apparatus is of a unit utilization type, and if the known line sequence scanning is employed, a large number of connections between the respective units in the lateral direction is required and the installation thereof becomes complicated. Moreover, if the display apparatus is jumbo sized as described above, and if the signal transmission is carried out in an analog fashion, errors such as cross talk and time base error are easily caused. Thus, it might be considered that the signal should be transmitted in the form of a digital signal However, if a flat cable is used as the transmission line, the transmission speed is generally restricted to about 300 kHz. On the other hand, the time available to send the signal to the whole picture screen is limited to 1 30 second. Moreover, in the above display apparatus, the brightness characteristic of each display cell 40 tends to fluctuate. Generally, in a display cell of mass production type, due to the distance between the cathode and the grid, variations in the deposition of carbonate which forms the electron emission substance, or secular variation in the carbonate, the electron emission characteristic of the cathode fluctuates and hence the brightness characteristic vary from one display cell to another. Accordingly, when a large number of the display cells are aligned to form a display screen, the brightness characteristics vary due to these fluctuations in the electron emission characteristics, so that the whole display becomes deteriorated in quality. Therefore, even if the control is such that a large number of the brightness steps are available, such brightness steps become non effective. While it might be considered that, for example, a variable resistor could be provided for each display cell for fine adjustment of the brightness thereof, when there are a very large number of display cells such adjustment becomes very difficult. According to the present invention there is provided a video display apparatus comprising The invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, throughout which like parts are referred to by like references, and in which Figure 14 is a block diagram showing an embodiment of the video display apparatus according to the present invention. In this embodiment the video signals from a television camera 101, a video tape recorder VTR 102, or a tuner 103 selected by an input change over switch 104. These video signals are each a composite video signal of, for example, the NTSC system. The video signal selected by the switch 104 is supplied to a decoder 105 in which it is decoded to three colour component signals of red, green and blue. these three colour component signals are respectively supplied to analog to digital A D converters 106R, 106G and 106B and converted to 8 bit parallel digital signals, respectively. These digital signals are supplied alternately to memories 171 171R, 171G, 171B and memories 172 172R, 172G, 172B each of which has one field capacity. The memories 171 and 172 each form a scanning converter which provides four horizontal lines from five horizontal lines. Further, for 189 horizontal lines, for example, selected from each field of the scanning converted signal, there are derived one output at every three horizontal lines, totally 63 x 8 bit parallel outputs. The order of deriving the signal from the scanning converter is a specific one, such that after the supply of the signal to one of the units described previously has been completed, the supply of the signal to the next adjacent unit will be done. That is, as shown in Figure 15, when there are two adjacent units U₁ and U₂, in one field the digital data for a segment corresponding to each cell is sequentially derived from one memory in the numbered order, and after the segment data corresponding to three horizontal lines comprising cells 201 to 204, 205 to 208 and 209 to 212 in the left unit U₁ have been completely derived, the segment data corresponding to three horizontal ines of cells 213 to 216, 217 to 220 and 221 to 224 in the right unit U₂ are derived. Then, the derivation of the segment data is shifted to the right side unit successively. The segment data corresponding to the horizontal lines of cells marked by the corresponding numbers with a dash in Figure 15 are derived from the other memory in the next field by interlace scanning. These segment data are derived at the same time from the respective memory 171 or 172, respectively. This data deriving is carried out such that 63 data at every three lines are simultaneously derived. The data thus derived are supplied to a data selector 108 in which at every field the red, green and blue data are dot sequentially selected from the memory in which no writing is carried out thereby to form the data signal of 63 x 8 bit parallel . The data signals so formed are fed to a multiplexer 109 in which 8 bit parallel signals are respectively converted to serial data signals. The signals thus converted are supplied to an optical converter 110 and converted thereby to the corresponding optical signal. The optical signals of 63 data at every three horizontal lines are transmitted through optical fibre cables 301, 302, ... 363 to centre portions of lateral groups 401, 402, ... 463 respectively where each group represents the total units of the display apparatus arranged laterally. Then, for example, in the uppermost group 401 of the units, the optical signal from the optical fibre cable 301 is fed to a photo electric converter 111 and converted thereby to the corresponding electrical signal. This converted data signal is supplied to a demultiplexer 112 in which the serial data signal is converted to the 8 bit parallel signal. This parallel data signal is supplied at the same time through a bus line 113 to, for example, 100 units 114₁, 114₂, ... 114₁₀₀, which are laterally arranged, in parallel. The signal from the photo electric converter 111 is further supplied to a sync separator 115 in which synchronizing signals are formed by a predetermined pattern generator. The synchronizing signals therefrom are fed to a timing generator circuit 116 in which there are respectively generated a frame pulse signal FP which is inverted at every field as shown in Figure 16A, a unit clock signal UCK which has 255 cycles during a half period one field of the frame pulse signal as shown in Figure 16B, an element clock signal ECK which contains 38 cycles during two cycles of the unit clock signal UCK as shown in Figure 16C, and a start pulse SSP which is formed by one element clock signal amount at every inversion of the frame pulse signal as shown in Figure 16D. The frame pulse signal FD, unit clock signal UCK and element clock signal ECK are supplied together with the above data signal through the bus line 113 to the respective units 114₁, 114₂, ... 114₁₀₀ in parallel while the start pulse is supplied to the first unit 114₁. Operation similar to the above is carried out in each of the 63 groups 401, 402, ... 463. In each of the units above, the signal translating circuit is formed as shown in Figure 17 and comprises a shift register 121 having 38 stages. In this case, the element clock signal ECK from the timing generator circuit 116 through the bus line 113 is supplied to the clock input terminal of the shift register 121 and the start pulse SSP is supplied to its data input terminal. Then, from the respective stages of the shift register 121 there are delivered sequentially shifted signals S₁, S₂, ... S₃₈ as shown in Figure 16E. The signals S₁ to S₃₆ are respectively supplied to the display segments or elements 201R, 201G, 201B, 202R, 202G, 202B, ... 212R, 212G, 212B of each of the cells 201 to 212 and to elements 201 R , 201 G, 201 B, 202 R, 202 G, 202 B, ... 212 R, 212 G, 212 B of each of the cells 201 to 212 . In Figure 17, the circuits in one dot chain line block are equivalent with one another. The data signals, as shown in Figure 16F, from the bus line 113 are supplied to all the elements 201R to 212 B in parallel. The frame pulse signal FP is supplied to the elements 201R to 212B and to the elements 201 R to 212 B after being reversed in phase by an inverter 122. The signal S₃₈ from the shift register 121 is supplied to a D type flip flop 123 which then produces a start pulse signal SSP to be supplied to the next adjacent unit as shown in Figure 16G. The signal circuit which will drive each element is constructed as shown in Figure 18 and comprises an 8 bit latch circuit 131 which is supplied at its data input terminals with the data signal from the bus line 113. An AND circuit 132 is provided which is supplied with the frame pulse signal FP or its inverted signal and one of the signals S₁ to S₃₆. The output from the AND circuit 132 is supplied to the control terminal of the latch circuit 131. An 8 bit down counter 133 is provided which is supplied at its preset terminals with the output from the latch circuit 131, at its load terminal with the load pulse signal S₃₈ from the shift register 121 and at its clock input terminal with the unit clock signal UCK from the bus line 113, respectively. When the counter 133 is in a condition other than the all zero condition, it produces an output signal which is supplied to the first grid G₁ of each element mentioned above. The output signal of the counter 133 is phase inverted by an inverter 134 and then supplied to the count stop terminal of the counter 133. Accordingly, in each element of each unit, at the times of the signals S₁ to S₃₆, the data from the bus line 113 are latched in the latching circuit 131 of the corresponding element and then held therein. The data held therein are preset to the counter 133 at the time of the signal S₃₈. The preset data are then counted down until the counter 133 reaches the all zero condition, so that at the output terminal of the counter 133 there is developed the pulse width modulated signals in accordance with each data signal. In this case, the counter 133 counts down the preset data in response to the unit clock signal UCK. Since this unit clock signal has 25 cycles during one field period, when the data has the largest value, a display element is displayed during one field period continuously, while when the data has the smallest value, the display element is not displayed so that the display therebetween can be divided into 256 brightness steps. The first grid G₁ of each element can be driven by the pulse width modulated signal. Moreover, at the time of the signal S₃₈ the start pulse signal for the next adjacent unit is produced. Thereafter, an operation similar to the above operation is sequentially carried out for 100 units arranged laterally. Moreover, the data latching operation of each unit is performed during the 2 cycle period of the unit clock signal UCK so that such operation for 100 unit arranged laterally is completed in 200 cycles. Therefore, by utilizing the remaining 55 cycles, special control signals such as the synchronizing signal and so on can be transmitted. Since in the next field the frame pulse signal FP is inverted in phase, a similar operation is carried out for the other picture elements of the interlace scanning. At this time, the preset pulse is supplied to the picture elements which were driven in the previous field, so that the same display is performed twice on each picture element during the successive 2 field intervals. Thus, the displays are performed on 100 units which are arranged laterally. Further, such display is performed for the 63 vertical direction groups of units in paralle at the same time, whereby a whole picture is displayed. Moreover, in the above display apparatus, a drive circuit which drives each luminescent display cell 40 is constructed as shown in Figure 19. In Figure 19, the red, green and blue pulse width modulated signals from the pulse width modulated signal forming circuit 500 are respectively supplied to bases of switching transistors 501R, 501G and 501B. The emitters of the transistors 501R, 501G and 501B are respectively grounded and the collectors thereof are respectively connected through resistors 502R, 502G and 502B of high resistive value, for example, 100 kilohms to the first grids G Furthermore, the cathodes K In this circuit, since the voltage from the voltage source 503 of 50 V is supplied through the resistors 504R and 502R 504G and 502G and 504B and 502B of high resistive value to the first grids G In this case, the cathode current Ik which is proportional to the electron emission, the target current IT which is proportional to the brightness and the grid current IG satisfy the relation Thus, the target current relating to the brightness is a value which is proportional to the grid current. Accordingly, in the above circuit, when the grid currents I In other words, since the resistive values of the resistors 504R and 502R 504G and 502G and 504B and 502B are selected so as to become sufficiently large relative to the equivalent impedance when the cathodes K If one of each pair of the resistors 504R and 502R 504G and 502G and 504B and 502B only is provided with the resistive value of 200 kilohms, the same constant current effect can be achieved. However, when only the resistors 502R, 502G and 502B are 200 kilohms in resistive value, the voltage of 50 V is directly supplied to the transistors 501R, 501G and 501B, so that it is necessary to increase the breakdown voltage of the transistors 501R, 501G and 501B. While, when only the resistors 504R, 504G and 504B are 200 kilohms in resistive value, there is a risk that the transistors 501R, 501G and 501B may be destroyed by the discharge from the display screen side. In order to protect the transistors 501R, 501G and 501B from such destruction, it is preferred that a pair of resistors are used as the example mentioned above. Furthermore, there is a risk that the constant current will fluctuate due to variations in the resistors 502R and 504R 502G and 504G and 502B and 504B. However, this will cause no substantial problem if a resistor having an error of within about 5 is used. Such resistors are easily available on the market. Thus, a jumbo sized picture of, for example, 25 m column x 40 m row is displayed. With the above picture display apparatus, since the data are sequentially transmitted at every unit and after the data transmission of one display unit is completed, the data of the next adjacent display unit is transmitted, the display operation is completed at each unit. As a result, the wiring between the respective units only requires one line to transmit the start pulse SSP from one unit to the next unit, so that the connections become quite simple. The supply of the data signal and so on from the bus line to each unit can be performed by using a multi contact connector. Therefore, when the units are attached or exchanged, the work becomes simple and the assembling and repairing thereof become quite easy. For example, if one unit becomes out of order, it is sufficient that the unit is exchanged for a new good unit. Upon this exchange, since the number of lines for electrical connection is small, the exchange can be done rapidly and easily. Moreover, risk of trouble caused, for example, by a contact miss can be reduced. Moreover, as an emergency measure, it is sufficient that a counter which can count up to 38 is connected between the input and output terminals for the start pulse of an inoperative unit and then this inoperative unit is removed. In this case, there is no adverse effect on the other units Furthermore, when the operation of a certain unit is to be checked, since the signal is completed within the unit, the check is very easy. Also, since the data is transmitted in parallel to every laterally arranged unit, the transmission speed is made low. That is, the data transmission speed in the above embodiment becomes as follows Further, the data transmission is such that the data of 2 field amounts of the interlace scanning are transmitted in one frame interval and the data is rewritten only once in each picture element at one frame interval. However, the display is repated in two sequential fields and the display frequency is 60 Hz, so that the generation of flicker can be suppressed. Moreover, in the above display apparatus, the first grid current is made a constant current, so that fluctuation of the brightness characteristics on the phosphor screen can be prevented. As a result, the brightness on the display screen can be prevented from becoming irregular and, when the display apparatus is formed as a colour display apparatus, irregularities in the colour are avoided. Since the brightness does not fluctuate, brightness adjustment is not necessary. Accordingly, the adjustment of the whole of the display apparatus can be simplified, and installation of the display apparatus is also made easy. Furthermore, it becomes unnecessary to provide the cut off adjustment variable resistors, and since the constant current driving is carried out forcibly, it is free from the influence due to secular variation of the electron emission.
