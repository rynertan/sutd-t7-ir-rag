# Treatment of effluent gases from the manufacture of fertilizer and products obtained thereby.

## Abstract
Reaction of phosphoric acid with ammonia by known means to produce nitrogen phosphate fertilizer results in an effluent gas containing ammonia together with fluoride and other particulates. Conventionally, the effluent is washed with aqueous phosphoric acid to remove ammonia and subse quently the effluent is scrubbed with large amounts of pond water to remove residual particulates. The large amounts of pond water required means that large ponds have to be con structed and maintained and in addition to the undesirable cost of so doing there is additional disadvantage in that large areas of land cannot be put to better use. The invention enables treatment of the effluent with at least comparable results but without the need for large ponds by washing the effluent with concentrated aqueous phosphoric acid, for example by contact in a venturi 16 of a chamber 14 in a contactor 12 , and contacting the remaining effluent with target particles of solid sorbent, for example by injecting into the effluent a sorbent laden secondary gas stream in a chamber 28 , to capture particulates carried in the effluent.

## Description
Treatment of effluent gases from the manufacture of fertilizer ar products obtained thereby. This invent ion relates to an improved process for the reduction of air and water pollution resulting from the manufacture of fertilizer. In the manufacture of fertilizers aqueous phosphoric acids or acid salts thereof are produced and reacted with ammonia to produce various nitrogen grades of fertilizer such as monoammonium or diammonium phosphate. In one common process, phosphate roc containing fluorapatite LCa5F PO4 3 is ground and reacted with aqueous sulfuric acid. After filtering to separate gypsum and other insoluble by products, the crude aqueous phosphoric acid is concentrated by evaporation. Substantial quantities of fluoride gases are produced which are scrubbed from the effluent gases and substantial cooling is required.Large ponds are employed as repositories for insoluble by products and as a source of recycle water for washing the filters and for scrubbing and cooling. Such ponds are costly to build and operate and are of increasing concern as a source of water and air pollution. When aqueous phosphoric acid is reacted with ammonia, the resulting effluent gases contain substantial quantities of ammonia, fluoride, and other particulates. Conventionally, these gases have been washed with aqueous phosphoric acid to recover ammonia and a portion of the particulates, and thereafter scrubbed with pond water in a packed enclosure before e7 austing to atmosphere. Washing with phosphoric acid releases fluoride gases such as HF and SiT, and copious quantities of pond water are subsequently required for cooling to more effectively remove the fluoride gases and submicron particulates. It has been estimated that the cooling ponds employer cost per acre between US 20,000 and US 30,000 to build and between US 20CO and US 5000 per year to maintain. Expensive piping is also required and all overflows must be carefully neutralized. A typical integrated site will require a cooling pond area of one hundred acres or more, about one half of which may be required to scrub the effluent gases from the ammonia phosphoric acid reactor. The phosphoric acid used to wash the gases has been restricted to aqueous concentrations between 201c and 4O P205 by weight because, at higher concentrations, increasing quantities of submicron fluoride particulates such as No4 , NR4 HF and IÂµH4 25iF6 are produced which are very difficult to remove from the gases. As a result, substantial water is present in the ammoniated acid when it is returned to the process for drying and conversion to product. About 85 99 of the ammonia in the effluent gases has been thus recovered. Since pond water typically is highly acidic, scrubbing with phosphoric acid is sometimes omitted and pond water is employed throughout. As will be appreciated from the specific Stample which follows, the present invention enables the effluent gases from an ammonium fertilizer reactor to be treated more effectively and more economically, without the need for cooling water with its attendant cooling pond. The invention also enables an improved rate of recovery of ammonia and a decrease in the water load on the dryer, and enables the separated wastes to be provided in a convenient solid form which can be used or readily disposed of as described hereinafter. According to the invention, there is provided a proc ess which comprises washing the effluent gas stream from an ammonia reactor, with or without inclusion of effluent gases from the product dryers, with concentrated phosphoric acid having a P205 content by weight between 45i and 55 , and most preferably fC , followed thereafter by treatment of the gases by contact them with dry, finely divided, target particles of sorbent material, anti separating the particulate material from the gas. By naming a dry process to. capture particulates and acid gases, the need for cooling water is eliminated, and by using concentrated phosphoric acid as the scrubbing liquid, moisture saturation of the gases is avoided which may interfere with the subsequent dry sorption process. A number of suitable dry processes are known. For e ample, the use of target particles of nepheline syenite, phonolite, calcium hydroxide or the like is disclosed in U S. Patents 3,721,066 2,773,663 3,808,774 3,854,417 3,995,005 and 3,969,482. As disclosed therein, the target particles which contact the gas may be used as a preccating on baghouse filters, may be introduced into the gas stream as.a dry powder, or may be entrained in a secondary air or other gas stream, Most preferably, however, they are mized in a secondary air or other gas stream and injected into the primary effluent gas stream with a relative velocity sufficient to capture the contaminating particulates by impact, To obtain distribution of the target particulatas throughout the effluent gas while maintaining relative velocity, the secondary stream may conveniently be introduced into the interior of the effluent stream. Preferably, the second gas stream is introduced into the effluent gas stream c ountercurrently thereto. The target particulates are large enough so that after they combine with contaminating particulates, the resulting particle size and mass will be such as to permit efficient capture and separation by conventional gas cleaning equipment. Apparatus for treating an effluent gas stream in this manner may conveniently comprise a first conduit for carrying the effluent gas stream along z first flow path, and a second conduit communicating with the first conduit.Means are provided for producing a secondary gas stream in the second conduit and for injecting target particulates into the secondary gas streamer a location sufficiently removed from the outlet end of the second conduit to permit the target particulates to become dispersed by and suspended in the secondary gas stream before introduction into the effluent gas stream. The exit end of the second conduit communicates with the interior of the first conduit.Distributor means located within the first conduit is preferred. The distributor means is preferably arranged to introduce the secondary gas stream countercurrently into theeffluent gas stream. It is further preferred to employ means for accelerating the effluent gas stream during introduction of the secondary gas stream, which accelerating means may comprise deflector means directing the effluent stream toward or away from the first conduit walls. The target particles preferably have an average particle size between 3 and 50 microns, more preferably 10 20 microns, and are preferably alkaline reacting materials so as to remove residual contaminating acid gases. Nepheline syenite is most preferred. The target particles and contaminating particulates may be separated from the gas in any convenient way, for example by baghouse filters as mentioned above or a cyclone separator. While the use of concentrated phosphoric acid to wash ammonia from the gases as described above is preferred, conventional phosphoric acid of lower concentration or acidic pond water may also be used, but with lowered efficiency. Some heating of the gases may be necessary to maintain a dry bulb temperature at least 600 20 above dew point during particulate separation. The following is a specific description intended to illustrate the invention, reference being made to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a schematic illustration of a preferred embodiment of the invention Figure 2 is a side view, partially broken away and on an enlarged scale, of preferred apparatus in which to mix washed effluent stream and secondary particulateladen air stream chamber 28 of Figure 1 Figure 3 is an end view of the apparatus shomm inFigure 2 in addition showing certain features or conduit 26 of Figure 1 and Figure 4 is a partially exploded view of the distributor shown general at 10 in Figures 2 and 3. Ref erring to the drawing, aqueous phosphoric acid shown as P205 is reacted with ammonia in NP reactor 10 to obtain ammonium phosphate salts and the UP product recovered for further processing, for example drying and granulating. The effluent gases S1 from the reactor 10 containing ammonia, fluorides and solid particulates are passed into the venturi contactor 12. Contactor 12 comprises an inner chamber 14 open at each end with a venturi 16 in its upper portion, and an outer concentric chamber 18 having a gas outlet 24 and fluid outlet 25.Concentrated phosphoric acid P205 is sprayed into the gas S1 as it enters the venturi 160 The acid reacts with and captures the majority of the ammonia entrained in effluent S1 and the resulting liquid is drained from the bottom of contactor 12 through outlet 25.with a portion recirculated to contactor 12 as shown at 20 and another portion or slipstream returned to reactor 1G as shown at 22.Typically, a major portion of the phosphoric acid product is recirculated to contactor 12, The contact of the ammonia laden gases with the concentrated phosphoric acid results not only in the absorption of ammonia but also the formation of ammonium fluoride, ammonium bib fluoride particulates and some HF and SiF4. Effluent gas Si is passed downwardly through vertical chamber 14, outwardly through its open lower end into annular chamber 18 where it passes upwardly to the gas outlet 24, and exits as washed gas S2 into a conduit 26. In chamber 28, the gas S2 is mixed with a secondary air stream 30 into which target particles of sorbent material have b en dispersed. The secondary stream 30 is preferably injected from a plurality of radial positions into the mixing chamber 28, which may comprise a portion of the duct 26, with a relative velocity sufficient for the target particles to capture by impact the contaminating particulates in stream S2. The combined gas stream S3 then passes to separating apparatus 32 which may comprise a cyclone or other apparatus of known construction, but which is preferably a baghouse. In the preferred mixing shown in Figures 2 4 a curved upper section 34 of a supply conduit 30 for secondary airstream and particulate extends through the wall of section 22t of conduit 26 of Figure 1 and has a flange 32 for joining curved upper section 341 to the remainder of conduit 30.The inner extremity of curved upper section 34 is fixed by supports 42a, 42b and 42c and is joined to a first right truncated cone 38 forming part of distributor 100 and made of sheet material, the truncated cone 38 having its larger base directed upstream with respect to the flow path of gas six Located concentrically within and spaced from cone 38 is a second right cone 501 having its apex directed downstream with respect to the flow of and upstream with respect to the flow of gas A2.Cones 38 and 50 define therebetween an annular passageway for the secondary gas stream A2 which terminates in an annular orifice 40t through which the stream A2 is introduced and injected countercurrently into effluent gas S2. Together they constitute distributor means for introducing and injecting stream A2 into stream 52 at a plurality of positions about the axis of duct 121. A third right cone 52 is provided with its base joined to the base of cone 50 and with its apex directed upstream with respect to the flow of gas S2 Cone 52 serves both as accelerating means for the acceleration of gas stream S2 during introduction of stream A2 S and as deflector means for deflecting the flow of S2 toward the walls of conduit 26 of Figure 1 transversely across the orifice 4Q Cone 50 is secured to cone 38 by means of bolts 54 and is spaced therefrom by means of four spacer members 58 v As shown in Figure 3, a hinged door 46 is provided upstream of flange 24t for providing access to the interior of conduit 26.Also shown is a pipe stub 44 for connection to a fume hood not shown over a particulates supply hopper not shown to prevent escape of target particulate to the atmosphere. By means of the apparatus shown in Figures 2 4, the gas stream A2 and dispersed target particulates are introduced into the interior of stream S1, with good distribution and high relative velocity. Relative velocity as used herein refers to the algebraic sum of the vectors of the flow of gas stream S2 and A2 parallel to the axis of duct 26 during introduction ofA2 into S,. relative velocity of 20 200 feet per second 6.096 60.96 m sec. is preferred and from 50150 15.24 45.72 rn sec. is more preferred.By the means shown, an efficiency of capture of submicron particulates equivalent to a liquid venturi having an inlet to throat pressure drop of from 50 to 150 inches 1 27 3.81 metres water gauge can be obtained with substantially reduced power, without contaminated wash liquid, and with reduced corrosion. imbile circular sections for conduits and cones are preferred as shown, other polygonal or oval sections can be used. Preferably, the same sections are used on all concentric parts to maintain uniformity of flow about the longitudinal axis of conduit section 22 . From Figures 2 4, it will be noted that while the flow is countercurrent, there are also radial components of flow as the streams S2 and 92 merge. As used herein, the term countercurrent includes such flow where there is a substantial vector component of motion against the direction of flow of the primary effluent stream S2 parallel to the axis of conduit 12. Countercurrent injection of the dispersed target particles distribute I interiorly of the walls of the conduit is preferred.. The cleaned gas stream S4 is not saturated with moisture and is exhausted from the separator 32 with essentially no visible appearance. Except for the scrubbing materials, no heat is added to or removed from the gas. The solids separated within separator 32 are removed as a free flowing powder at 34. They include the target particulates, preferably nepheline syenite, and recovered contaminating particulates and acid gases, principally as ammonium fluoride ammonium fluoride ENH4F.HF , and ammonium fluosilicate NH4 2Si 63 . The solids collected may be mixed with the fertilizer product for sale or the ammonium fluoride salts may be dissolved in a concentrated form and a portion of the insoluble nepheline syenite separated and recycled.The ammonium fluoride salts may also be sold as a fluxing agent in the manufacture of nonferrous metals or may be added to impure phosphoric acid as a clarifying agent. The mixed gas stream S3 contains sufficient moisture for activation of nepheline syenite or other target particulate material as disclosed in the above referenced patents but is sufficiently low in relative humidity to avoid plugging separator 32. Typically, the gas stream has a dry bulb temperature above 125 F 51.6 rec. C and from 400F 4.4 rec.0C to 800F 26.6 rec.0C higher than its dew point temperature. A temperature difference of at least 200F 6.6 rec C should be maintained. If desired, the gases effluent from apparatus such as a drier or granulator provided to treat the fertilizer product of the NP reactor 10 can be similarly treated together with or separately from the effluent gases from the NP reactor. The following Example is intended further to illustrate the invention. Exam l e 60,000 A actual cubic feet per minute i699.01 m3 min. of effluent gas s1 having a dry bulb dew point temperature of 155 1500 68. 3 rev 65.5 rec C and containing 2 pounds per hour fluoride, 1,000 pounds 453.59 kg per hour of NH3, , and 500 pounds 226.79 kg. per hour of contamineting particulates was passed into venturi 16 of contactor 12. 900 US gallons 3.407 m3 per minute of phosphoric acid at 50 wt. P205 were recirculated through chamber 14 of contactor 12, and a slipstream of the recirculating liquid was returned via conduit 22 to reactor 10. 55,000 ACR6 actual cubic feet per minute 1557.5 m3 min. of scrubbed gas S2 were recovered from contactor 12 having a dry bulb wet bulb temperature of 184 1270F 84.4 rev 52.7 rec C and having a fluoride content of 2 pounds 0.9072 kg per hour, NH3 content of 10 pounds 4.536 Xg. per hour and a contaminating particulate content of 700 pounds 317.51 kg. per hour.A secondary air stream of 3,000 ACFM 84.95 m3 min.. at 900F 32.2 rec C dry bulb , having 60 pounds 27.216 k per hour of nepheline syenite with an average particle size between 10 and 20 microns dispersed therein, was injected into the stream S2 within chamber 28.The mixed gas streamS3 exited from chamber 28 at 58,000 AC y 1642.37 m3 min. and with a temperature, dry bulb wet bulb, of 178 125 F 81 1 rec. 51.6 rec.0C and was passed through a baghouse 32. Effluent gas stream S4 was discharged at the rate of 58,000 AC DI 1642.37 m3 min. at a dry bulb wet bulb temperature of 178 1250 81.1 rec 51.6rec C and with an ammonia gas content of 3 pounds 1.361 kg. per hour, fluoride gas content of 0.5 pounds 0.2268 k per hour and a particulate material content of about 14 pounds 6.35 kg per hour. About 99 st. of the NH3 in the effluent gas was recovered as product. A comparison between the prior art process and the present process is given in the Table below for 2 plant having a production rate of dried NP product of about 140 US tons 127006 kg. per hour.

Concentrated phosphoric acid, about 45 55 P205 by weight, is preferred for use in the process herein disclosed. Improved ammonia recovery is obtained, less drying is required to recover product therefrom, and subsequent heating of the gases is usually unnecessary.However, if desired, lower concentrations of P20s, or acidic pond water may be used. Subsequent dry scrubbing of particulates as described will still eliminate most of the pond water now used with its attendant cost and limitations. With such acids, some heating of the gases may be necessary to maintain dry bulb gas temperature about 200F 6r6 rec. C or more above dew point during particulate material separation. Such heating, where required, may be provided at any suitable location. Such heating may be applied, for example, to one or more of gas streams S1, , 53 or the secondary stream 30 as shown in the drawing. As illustrated and described above, the present invention is more economic than presently used technology, minimizes secondary pollution, conserves land, and can produce separated solids as a saleable product.
