# Apparatus and method of NMR imaging with off center zoom scan.

## Abstract
In Fourier transform NMR imaging, magnified images free of aliasing artifacts are achieved by band limiting the NMR signal in the X and Y axes directions thereby avoiding under sampling. Band limiting in the X axis direction is accomplished by reducing the signal bandwidth by a low pass filter before AD conversion. In the Y axis direction, the signal is band limited by providing selective excitation of the spin isochromats, such that only spins in a selected Y region of the object are available to contribute to the signal. When the region of interest is not centered, offsets in the X and Y axes, directions are obtained by shifting the receiver frequency by an amount Î”f
