# Carbonaceous pitch with dormant anisotropic components, process for preparation thereof, and use thereof to make carbon fibres.

## Abstract
A novel carbonaceous pitch is provided which is optical ly isotropic in nature and which is converted into optically anisotropic when shear forces are applied thereto. The carbonaceous pitch may be obtained by hydrogenating the mesophase of a mesophase pitch to the extent that the mesophase is rendered soluble in quinoline. The novel carbonaceous pitch is useful as a binder, an impregnator or, especially, as a precursor material for the production of highly oriented, high strength and high modulus carbon fibers, needle coke or like carbonaceous materials.
