# New methylene phosphonic acid scale inhibitor compositions derived from aminohydrocarbylpiperazine urea adducts.

## Abstract
Certain methylene phosphonic acid derivatives of aminohydrocarbyl piperazine urea adducts are good threshold agents to prevent metal ion precipitation in aqueous solutions. The adducts have the formula
