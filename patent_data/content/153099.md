# Combustion cylinder construction for oil burners.

## Abstract
A combustion cylinder construction 12 for an oil burner 10 having a wick 22 , is disclosed, which is adapted to adjust combustion while preventing the adhesion of soot, moisture and the like on the inner surface of a heat permeable cylinder 68 to keep it clean during combustion. The combustion cylin der construction includes a first heat permeable cylinder 34 and a second heat permeable cylinder 68 supported on the first heat permeable cylinder, with a gap 70 being defined therebetween which serves to introduce air from the exterior therethrough to the overall inner surface of the second heat permeable cylinder.
