# A timing system.

## Abstract
A system is provided for producing on board timing for a vehicle traversing a course such as a car raceing circuit or a speedboat course defined by marker buoys. The vehicle is equipped with a magnetic sensing coil 22 for producing elec trical signals in response to detection of magnets disposed at one or more positions along the course. In the case of buoy markers, the magnets 26 may be mounted on certain of the buoys 10, 13, 14, 17 . The output from the sensing coil 22 is used to control on board timing circuitry to enable the average vehicle speed over the course to be determined and displayed.
