# A helically shaped intake port of an internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
An engine comprising an intake port 6 which has a separating wall 12 projecting downwardly from the upper wall 11 of the intake port. The separating wall defines a helical portion B , an inlet passage portion A tangentially connected to the helical portion, and a bypass passage 28 interconnecting the inlet passage portion and the helical portion. The intake port has a bottom wall 21 having a transverse width which is approximately equal to the diameter of the valve head of the intake valve 5 . The opposed peripheral edges of the bottom wall are located on the extensions of the tanget lines of the outer periphery of the valve head of the intake valve. A rotary valve 25 is arranged in the bypass passage and is actuated by a vacuum operated diaphragm apparatus 40 . The rotary valve is opened when the amount of air fed into the cylinder of the engine is increased beyond a predetermined value.
