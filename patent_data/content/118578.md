## Description
POLYETHERS CONTAINING 2, 2, 6, 6 TETRAMETHYLPIPERIDINYL CARBOXYLIC ACID ESTER GROUPS AND SYNTHETIC RESIN COMPOSITIONS Polymers such as polyethylene, polypropylene,ABS resin, polyvinyl chloride and polyurethane undergo degradation and discoloration when subjected to irradiation by ultraviolet light such as sunlight, with deterioration in mechanical strength. Accordingly, various kinds of light stabilizers have been incorporated in such polymers to lessen their deterioration. However, the available stabilizers are unsatisfactory in their stabilizing effectiveness, unstable to heat and oxidation, and soluble in water or organic solvents.Some stabilizers even impart a color of their own to the polymers. 2, 2, 6, 6 tetramethyl piperidine compounds do not impart color to the polymer, and act as quencliers. Many piperidine compounds, therefore, are proposed as light stabilizers. Crook U.

Synthetic resins that can have their resistance to deterioration enhanced with polyether piperidyl esters and ethers according to this invention include Ó olefin polymers such as polyethylene7 polypr ne, polybutene, poly 3 methylbutene, or mixtures thereof, and copolymers with other monomers such as ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer ethylene propylene copoly mer polystyrene polyvinyl acetate polyacryl esters copoly mers from styrene and another monomer for example, maleic an hydride, butadiene, and acrylonitrile acrylonitrile butadiene styrene copolymer, acrylic acid ester butadiene styrene copoly mer, methacrylic acid ester butadiene styrene copolymer, poly methacrylate esters such as polymethacrylate polyvinyl alcohol polyvinyl formal polyvinyl butyral linear polyesters, polyamides polycarbonates polyacetals polyurethanes cellulosic resins phenol formaldehyde resins urea formadehyde resins melamine formaldehyde resins epoxy resins unsaturated polyester resins silicone resins halogen containing resins such as polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene chloride, polyvinyl idene fluoride, and copolymers thereof, and rubbers such as isoprene rubber, butadiene rubber, epichlorohydrin rubber, chloroprene rubber, and blends of any of the above. The polyether piperidyl esters and ethers of the invention can be combined with conventional heat stabilizers such as phenolic antioxidants, polyvalent metal salts of organic acids, organic phosphites, thioethers, and other known heat stabilizers, thereby constituting light and heat stabilizer compo sitions of the invention. The phenolic antioxidant contains one or more phenolic hydroxyl groups, and one or more phenolic nuclei, and can con tain from about eight to about three hundred carbon atoms. In ad dition, the phenolic nucleus can contain an oxy or thio ether group. The alkyl substituted phenols and polynuclear phenols, because of their molecular weight, have a higher boiling point, and therefore are preferred because of their lower volatility. There can be one or a plurality of alkyl groups of one or more carbon atoms. The alkyl group or groups including any alkylene groups between phenol nuclei preferably aggregate at least four carbon atoms. The longer the alkyl or alkylene chain, the better the compatibility with polypropylene, inasmuch as the phenolic compound then acquires more of an aliphatic hydrocarbon character, and therefore there is no upper limit on the number of alkyl carbon atoms. Usually, from the standpoint of avail ability, the compound will not have more than about eighteen carbon atoms in an alkyl, alicyclidene and alkylene group, and a total of not over about fifty carbon atoms. The compounds may have from one to four alkyl radicals per phenol nucleus. The phenol contains at least one and preferably at least two phenolic hydroxyls, the two or more hydroxyls being in the same ring, if there is only one. In the case of bicyclic phenols, the rings can be linked by thio or oxyether groups, or by alkylene, alicyclidene or alicyclidene or arylidene groups. The monocyclic phenols which can be employed have the structure EMI26.1 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen halogen and organic radicals containing from one to about thirty carbon atoms, such as alkyl, aryl, alkenyl, alkaryl, aralkyl, cycloalkenyl, cycloalkyl, alkoxy, and acyl where RÚ is aryl or cycloalkyl.EMI26.2 X1 and 5 are integers from one to four, and the sum of x1 and X2 does not exceed sis The polycyclic phenol phenol is one having at least two aromatic nuclei linked by a polyvalent linking radical, as defined by the formula EMI27.1 wherein Y is a polyvalent linking group selected from the group consisting of oxygen carbonyl sulfur sulfinyl aromatic, aliphatic and cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon groups and oxyhydro carbon, thiohydrocarbon and heterocyclic groups. The linking group can have from one up to twenty carbon atoms. Ar is a phenolic nucleus which can be a phenyl or a polycarbocyclic group having condensed or separate phenyl rings each Ar group contains at least one free phenolic hydroxyl group up to a total of five. The Ar rings can also include additional rings connected by additional linking nuclei of the type Y, for example, Ar Y Ar Y Ar. m1 and m2 are numbers from one to five, and n1 and n2 are numbers of one or greater, and preferably from one to four. The aromatic nucleus Ar can, in addition to phenolic hydroxyl groups, include one or more inert substituents. Examples of such inert substituents include hydrogen, halogen atoms, e.g, chlorine, bromine and fluorine organic radicals containing from one to about thirty carbon atoms, such as alkyl, aryl, alkaryl, aralkyl, cycloalkenyl, cycloalkyl, alkoxy, aryloxy and acyloxyEMI27.2 where R is aryl, alkyl or cyclo alkyl, or thioxycarbon groups having from one to about thirty carbon atoms, and carboxylEMI28.1 groups. Usually, however, each aromatic nucleus will not have more than about eighteen carbon atoms in any hydrocarbon substituent group. The Ar group can have from one to four substituent groups per nucleus. Typical aromatic nuclei include phenyl, naphtyl, phenaphtryl, triphenylenyl, anthracenyl, pyrenyl, chrysenyl, and fluroenyl groups. When Ar is a benzene nucleus, the polyhydric polycyclic phenol has the structure EMI28.2 wherein R1, R2 and R3 are inert substituent groups as described in the previous paragraph and and m3 are tegers from one to a maximum of five m2 is an integer from one to a maximum of four x1 and x3 are integers from zero to four and x2 is an integer from zero to three y1 is an integer from zero to about sis and y2 is an integer from one to five, preferably one or two. Preferably, the hydroxyl groups are located ortho and or para to Y. Exemplary Y groups are alkylene, alkylidene, and alkenylene, arylene, alkyl arylene, arylalkylene, cycloalkylene, cycloalkylidene and oxa and thia substituted such groups tetrahydrofuranes esters and triazino groups. The Y groups are usually bi, tri or tetravalent, connecting two, three or four Ar groups. However, higher valency Y groups connecting more than four Ar groups, can also be used.According to their constitution, the Y groups can be assigned to subgenera as follows 1 Y groups where at least one carbon in a chain or cyclic arrangements connect the aromatic groups, such as EMI29.1 EMI30.1 EMI30.2 2 Y groups where only atoms other than carbon link the aromatic rings, such as O , S ,EMI30.3 and S x where x is a number from one to ten 3 Y groups made up of more than a single atom including, both carbon and other atoms linking the aromatic nuclei, such as EMI31.1 EMI31.2 Although the realtion of effectiveness to chemical structure is insufficiently understood, many of the most effective phenols have Y groups of subgenus 1 , and accordingly this is preferred.Some of these phenols can be prepared by the alkylation of phenols or alkyl phenols with polyunsaturated hydrocarbons such as dicyclopentadiene or butadiene. Representative phenols include guaiacol, resorcinol monoacetate, vanillin, butyl salicylate, 2,6 di tert butyl 4methyl phenol, 2 tert butyl 4 methoxy phenol, 2,4 dinonyl phenol, 2,3,4,5 tetradecyl phenol, tetrahydro alpha naphthol, o , m and p cresol, o , m and p phenylphenol, o , m and p xylenois, the carvenols, symmetrical xylenol, thymol, o , mand p nonylphenol, o , m and p dodecyl phenol, and o , mand p octyl phenol, o , and m tert butyl p hydroxy anisole, p n decyloxy phenol, p n decyloxy cresol, nonyl n decyloxycresol, engenol, isoeugenol, gryceryl monosalicylate, methyl phydroxy cinnamate, 4 benzyloxy phenol, p acetylaminophenol, p stearyl aminophenol, methyl p hydroxybenzoate, p dichlorobenzoyl aminophenol, p hydroxysalicyl anilide, stearyl 3,5 di methyl 4 hydroxy benzyl thioglycolate, stearyl ss 4 hydroxy 3,5 di t butylphenyl propionate, distearyl 3,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxybenzylphosphonate, and distearyl 4 hydroxy 3 methyl 5 t butyl benzylmalonate.

A com mercially availubla member of this class is WLngstay t, exemplified by dicyclopentadiene tri 2 tert butyl 4 methyl phenol of the formula EMI36.1 The polyhydric polycyclic phenols used in the invention can also be condensation products of phenols or alkylphenols with hydrocarbons having a bicyclic ring structure and a double bond or two or more double bonds, such as Ó pinene, ss pinene, dipentene, limonene, vinylcyclohexene, dicyclopentadiene, allo ocimene, isoprene and butadiene. These condensation products are usually obtained under acidic conditions in the form of more or less complex mixtures of monomeric and polymeric compounds. However, it is usually not necessary to isolate the individual constituents.The entire reaction product, merely freed from the acidic condensation catalyst and un changed starting material, can be used with excellent results. While the exact structure of these phenolic condensation products is uncertain, the Y groups linking the phenolic nuclei all fall into the preferred subgenus 1. For method of prepara tion, see e.g., U.S. patent No.3,124,555, U.S. patent No. 3,242,135, and British patent No D 50 j,. When the polyether piperidyl ester or ether is used with a polyvalent metal salt of an organic acid, the organic acid will ordinarily have from about six to about twenty four carbon atoms. The polyvalent metal can be any metal of. Group II of the Periodic Table, such as zinc, calcium, cadmium, barium, magnesium and strontium. The alkaly metal salts and heavy metal salts such as lead salts are unsatisfactory. The acid can be any organic non nitrogenous monocarboxylic acid having from six to twenty four carbon atoms. The aliphatic, aromatic, alicyclic and oxygen containing heterocyclic organic acids are operable as a class. By the term aliphatic acid is meant any open chain carboxylic acid, substituted, if desired, with nonreactive groups, such as halogen, sulfur and hydroxyl. By the term alicyclic it will be understood that there is intended any cyclic acid in which the ring is nonaromatic and composed solely of carbon atoms, and such acids may if desired have inert, nonreactive substituents such as halogen, hydroxyl, alkyl radicals, alkenyl radicals and other carbocyclic ring structures condensed therewith. The oxygen containing hetero cyclic compounds can be aromatic or nonaromatic and can include oyygen and carbon in the ring structure, such as alkyl substituted furoic acid.The aromatic acids likewise can nonreactive ring substituents such as halogen, alkyl and alkenyl ,groups, and other saturated or aromatic rings, condensed there with As exemplary of the acids which can be used in the form of their metal salts there can be mentioned the following hexoic acid, 2 ethylhexoic acid, n octoic acid, isooctoic acid, capric acid, undecyclic acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, margaric acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, ricinoleic acid, behenic acid, chlorocaproic acid, hydroxy capric acid, benzoic acid, phenylacetic acid, butyl benzoic acid, ethyl benzoin acid, propyl benzoic acids hexyl benzoic acid, salicylic acid, naphthoic acid, 1 naphthalene acetic acid, orthobenzoyl benzoic acid, naphthenic acids derived from petroleum, abietic acid, dihydroabietic acid, hexahydrobenzoic acid, and methyl furoic acid. The water insoluble salts are preferred, because they are not leached out when the plastic is in contact with water.Where these salts are not bown, they are made by the usual types of reactions, such as by mixing the acid, or anhydride with the corresponding oxide or hydroxide of the metal in a liquid solvent, and heating, if necessary, until salt formation is complete. A variety of organic triphosphites and acid phosphites can be employed, of which the following are exemplary. The organic triphosphite can be any organic phosphite having three or more organic radicals attached to phosphorus through oxygen. The acid phosphite can be any organic phosphite having one or two organic radicals attached to phosphorus through oxygen. These radicals can be monovalent radicals, in the case of the triphosphites, diphosphites and monophosphites. The organic triphosphites in which the radicals are monovalent radicals can be defined by the formula EMI39.1 in which and and R3 are selected from the group consisting of alk yl, alkenyl, aryl, alkaryl, aralkyl, and cycloalkyl groups having from one to about thirty carbon atoms. The acid phosphites are defined by the same formula, butone or t vo of R,,, and R3 is hydrogen or a cation of a metal or ammonium Also included are the organic triphosphites having a bivalent organic radical forming a heterocyclic ring with the phosphorus of the type EMI40.1 in wich. R4 is a bivalent organic radical selected from the group consisting of alkylene, arylene, aralkylene, alkarylene and cycloalkylene radicals having from two to about thirty carbon atoms, and R5 is a monovalent organic radical as defined above in the case of R1, R2 and R3 R5 is hydrogen or a cation, in the case of the acid phosphites. Also useful organic triphosphites are mixed hetero cyclic open chain phosphites of the type EMI40.2 More complex triphosphites are formed from trivalent organic radicals, of the typeEMI40.3 in which R6 is a trivalent organic radical of any of the types ofR1 to R5, inclusive, as defined above. A particularly useful class of complex triphosphites are the tetraoxadiphosphaspiro undecanes 6f the formula EMI41.1 where R1 and R2 are selected from the group consisting of aryl, alkyl, aryloxyethyl, alkyloxyethyl, aryloxyethoxyethyl, alkyloxyethoxyethyl and alkyloxypolyethoxyethyl having from about 1 to about 30 carbon atoms. In the case of the acid phosphites, one or both of R1 andR2 is also hydrogen or a cation. An especially preferred class of organic triphosphites and acid phosphites have a bicyclic aromatic group attached to phosphorus through oxygen, with no or one or more phenolic hydroxyl groups on either or both of the aromatic rings These phosphites are characterized by the formula, EMI41.2 in which Ar is a mono or bicyclic aromatic nucleus and m is an integer of from 0 to about 5.EMI42.1 is one or a plurality o organic radicals as defined above for R1 to R6, taken singly or together in sufficient number to satisfy the valences of the two phosphite oxygen atomsOne or bothEMI42.2 radicals is also hydrogen, in the case of the acid phosphites, and can include additional bicyclic aromatic groups of the type HO m Ar The cation in the case of acid phosphites can be a met such as an alkali metal, for instance, sodium, potassium or lithium an alkaline earth metal, for instance, barium, calcium, or a nontoxic polyvalent metal, such as magnesium, tin and zinc. Usually, the triphosphites and acid phosphites will not have more than about sixty carbon atoms.

The thiodipropionic acid ester has the following formula R1OOCCH2CH2 S CH2CH2COOY in which R1 is an organic radical selected from the group con sisting of hydrocarbon radicals such as alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, cycloalkyl and mixed alkyl aryl and mixed alkyl cycloalkyl radicals hydroalkyl and hydroxyalkyloxyalkylene radicals and esters thereof with aliphatic carboxylic acids and Y is selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen, b a second R radical R2, which can be the same as or different from the R1 radical, c a polymeric chain of n thiodipropionic acid ester units XO OCCH2CH2SCH2CH2COOXO nOCCH2CH2 S CH2CH2COOZ where Z is hydrogen, R2 or M, n is the number of thiodipropion ic acid ester units in the chain, and X is a bivalent hydrocarbon group of the type of R1,that is, alkylene, alkenylene, cycloalkylene, mixed alkylene arylene and mixed alkylenecycloalkylene radicals hydroxyalkylene and hydroxyalkyloxyalkylene radicals and esters thereof with aliphatic carboxylic acids th,e value of n can range upwards from 0, but there is no upper limit on n except as is governed by the ratio of carbon atoms to sulfur atoms as stated below and d a polyvalent metal M of Group of the periodic table such as zinc, calcium cadmium, barium, magnesium and strontium. the The molecular weights of the R and Y radicals are taken siich that with the remainder of the molecule the thiod propionic ester has a total of from about ten to about sixty carbon atoms, per sulfur atom. Accordingly, the various thiodipropionic acid ester species coming within the above designated categories within the general formula can be defined as follows a R1OOCCH2CH2SCH2CH2COOH b R1 OOCCH2CH2SCH2CH2COOR2 c R1O OCCH2CH2SCH2CH2COOX O nOCCH2CH2SCH2CH2COOZ d R1OOCCH2CH2SCH2CH2COOM In the above formulae R1 and R2, M, X and Z are the same as before and the value of n1 can range upwards from 1, but there is no upper limit on n1 except as is imposed by the ratio of carbon atoms, as stated below In the polymer c , as in the other forms of thiodipropionic acid esters, the total number of carbon atoms per sulfur atom is within the range from about ten to about sixty. The R radical of these esters is important in furnishing compatibility with the polymer. The Y radical is desirably a different radical, R2 or M or a polymer, where R is rather low in molecular weight, so as to compensate for this in obtaining the optimum compatibility and nonvolatility. Where Y is a metal, the thiodipropionic acid ester furnishes the beneficial properties of the polyvalent metal salt which is described above.

In additio, other conventional additives for synthetic polymers, such as plasticizers, lubricants, emulsifiers, anti static agents, flame proofing agents, pigments and fillers, can be employed. The stabilizer or combination is incorporated in the polymer in suitable mixing equipment, such as a mill or a Banbury mixer. if the polymer has a melt viscosity which is too high for the desired use, the polymer can be worked until. its melt viscosity has been reduced to the desired range before addition of the stabilizer. Mixing is continued until the mixture is substan tially uniform. The resulting composition is then removed irom the mixing equipment and brought to the size and shape desired for marketing or use. The stabilized polymer can be worked into the desired shape, such as by milling, calendering, extruding or injection molding or fiber forming. In such operations, it will be found. to have a considerably improved resistance to reduction in melt viscosity during the heating, as well as a better resistance to discoloration and embrittlement on ageing and heating.
