# Laser welding method and apparatus.

## Abstract
A laser welding method and apparatus for welding stacked coated members 1, 2 in which voids in the welds are positively eliminated. A spacer 14 is disposed between the two members 1, 2 to be welded. This provides a path 16 for discharging gas formed by heating the coating material. The method and apparatus of the invention are useful for the laser welding of base members coated with metals having a lower melting point than the metal of the base, paints and oils. Preferably, the width of the gap is in a range of 0.1 mm to 0.5 mm.
