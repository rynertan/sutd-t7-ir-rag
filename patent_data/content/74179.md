# Absorbent composition.

## Abstract
An absorbent composition comprising the reaction product at elevated temperature and pressure of hydrolyzed starch polyacrylonitrile graft copolymer and a polyhydric alcohol such as glycerol in the amount of between about 3 and 20 is described. This composition exhibits good fluid absorbency and fast wicking properties and is particu larly useful in producing absorbent laminated film for use in diapers, paper towels and the like. There is also described an improved absorbent laminated film prepared with the above absorbent composition and a method for preparing such absorbent laminated film.
