# Oxygen concentration detector.

## Abstract
An oxygen concentration detector comprises an oxygen ion conductive solid electrolyte 1 and electrodes 3, 4, 11 provided thereon to form an oxygen concentration cell for detecting oxygen partial pressure in a gas such as exhaust gas from an internal combustion engine. The oxygen concentration detector according to the invention further comprises an AC power source 6 supplying to the elec trodes 3, 4, 11 an AC having a frequency at which a polarization of AC component is caused mainly due to a polarization of the solid electrolyte to detect an impedance of the solid electrolyte and the electromotive force of the oxygen concentration cell.
