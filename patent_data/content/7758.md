Using sulfonated polymers as the most preferred example of the anionic polymers of this invention, the ionically cross linked ionomers of this invention may be readily prepared from the sulfonate precursor, for example a free sulfonic acid, by direct neutralization, either in bulk or in solution with an alkyl ammonium hydroxide wherein the cation is selected from one of the specified classes, or by a primary, secondary or tertiary amine from one of the speci dried classes, or by a combination of these neutralizing agents.Another means of preparation is by double decomposition metathesis of a salt of the sulfonic acid with an alkyl ammonium salt of an acid which is weaker i.e. has a lower pKa than the sulfonic acid, or by double decomposition in a multiphase fluid medium in which the salt of the displaced counter ion is selectively removed from the phase containing the polymer to a phase in which the ammonium ionomer is substantially insoluble. The properties and utility of the ionic salts of this invention vary over a wide range depending on the structure of the anionic polymer, the average molecular weight and molecular weight distribution, the degree of neutralization of the anionic groups in the polymer, the mole concentration of the alkyl ammonium salt groups in the polymer, and in particular, the type and variety of the substituents attached to the nitrogen. The ionic salts can range from water soluble polyelectrolytes useful as adhesives and thickening agents to elastomers or hard resins which are thermoplastic at elevated temperatures permitting the products to be extruded, injection molded, vacuum formed and sheeted. A particularly useful form for an ionomer is a waterinsoluble elastomer which can be melt fabricated and then used without curing, and which can subsequently be reprocessed at elevated temperature since the ionomer does not contain permanent crosslinks.The preferred polymers.are as follows I.

The following examples more fully illustrace the invenrioz1. EXA N2LE 1 PREPARATION OF QUATERNARY AMMONIUM HYDROXIDES Four quaternary ammonium halides were obtained from the sources cited below and converted to the hydroxide form by the procedure described below. Dioctadecyldimethyl ammonium chloride, and octadecyltrimethylammonium chloride were purchased from Lachat Chemical Company. Decamethylene bistrimethyl ammonium dibromide was purchased from CityChemical Co pany. Triethyloctadecylammonium bromide was prepared via quaternization of criethyl amine by octadecyl bromide. In order to convert these halides to the hydroxide form, a percolacion column having a height to diameter ratio of approximately 15 1 was packed with AmberlystA 29, a commercially available anionic macroreticular ion exchange resin markeced as the chloride salt byRohm and Haas Co., Philadelphia, PA. The resin was converted to the hydroxide form by slowly passing 6.5 Ded volumes of a 10 wt. aqueous solution of reagent grade sodium hydroxide downward through the bed, followed by discilled water until the effluent had a pH of 7.0. The water in the column and in che resin was then displaced by percolating 15 volumes of anhydrous methanol downward through che column. Each of the above four quaternary ammonium halides was dissolved in 300 ml. of a solvent consisting of either anhydrous methanol or ethanol, or mixcures of these alcohols with either benzene or cyclohexane depending on che solubility characteristics of che particular halide. The various solution which ranged in concentration from about 0.5 to 20 grams of halide per 300 ml. of solvent were percolated through a freshly prepared column of che hydroxide form of the ion exchange resin. The receiver for the percolaced solution was blanketed with oxygen free nicrogen When sealed and refrigerated until used.Just before use an aliquoc of each solution was titrated wich standard alkali in order to check the basicicy. In addition to che quaternary ammonium hydroxides which were prepared above, the following qua ternary ammonium reagents were purchased in their hydroxide form fromSouthwestern Analytical Chemicals Company of Austin, Texas. N CH3 4 OH N CH2CH3 4 OH EXAMPLE 2 PREPARATION OF QUATERNARY AMMONIUM SALTS OF A SULFONATED EPDM An EPDM available on a commercial scale VISTA ON from Exxon Chemical Co., New York, New York, which comprised 52 wt. 7. of ethylene, 43 wt. of propylene and 5 wt. X of 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene and had a number average molecular weight of 35,000 and a Money viscosityML commat 100 C 1 8 min. of 42 was sulfonated using acecyl sulfate in accordance with the method disclosed in U.S.Patent 3,836,511. This free acid form of the sulfonated polymer was isolated from solution by steam stripping and dried on a warm two roll mill. The product was stored ac a temperature of 80 C prior to use. On the afternoon before che day of neutralization the free acid sulfonated polymer was cut into pieces and placed in a mixed solvent consiscing of 95 toluene and 5 methanol by volume, to prepare a solution having a concentration of 20 grams per liter. The mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight during which the polymer dissolved except for some small pieces of gel.In the morning the solution was filtered, and on nitration of an aliquot was found to have an acidity of O.39 milliequivalents of hydrogen per 100 ml. The following qua ternary ammonium hydroxides which were described in Example 1, were used to neutralize aliquots of the free acid sulfonated EPDM solution. 1. C18H37 2N CH3 2 OH 2. C2H5 3 N C18H37 OH 3. CH3 3N CH2 10N CH3 3 2 OH 4. C18H37 3 N CH3 3 OH 5. N CH3 4 OH 6. CH2CH3 4 OH The aliquots of the sulfonated EPDM solution were overbased with each of che quaternary ammonium hydroxide samples by the addition of 1.2 equivalents of the quaternary ammonium hydroxide per equivalent of sulfonic acid. The solutions were stirred under nitrogen for about 10 minutes, checked for basicity and slightly acidified with 2.5 acetic acid in methanol. Approxi ately G.25 equivalencs of the acetic acid were added per equivalent of acidity previously present in che solution.On neutralization some of che samples became cloudy. These cloudy solutions were clarified by che addition of toluene.The products were recovered by precipitation with about 10 volumes of methanol, followed by settling and decan tat ion of the supernatant liquid. Ln some cases where settling was incomplete, the solutions were centrifuged to consolidace the precipitate. Each of che recovered ionomers was overlaid wich sufficient methanol to cover the product then 0.1 by weight based on the weight of recovered product of a phenolic antioxidant antioxidant 2246 was added to each sample and after standing overnight the methanol was decanted and the products dried at room temperature in a vacuum oven for several days. While all of the sulfonate groups in the above and subsequent examples were completely neutralized, i.e.100 neutralization, in certain inscances it is desirable to partially neutralize. the anionic groups present in the polymer, e.g. 5 to 957. wich the quaternary ammonium hydroxides and leave some free acidity or complece che neucralizarion with a different counterion.EXAMPLE 3 PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF A SULFONATED EPDM CONTAINING MONOVALENT QUATERNARY AMMONIUM COOUNTERIONS Test pads were molded from the ionomer materials prepared from Samples 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 and 6 ofExample 2. The test pads were compression molded at 160 C. using a preheat of 2 minutes and 3 minutes under pressure.Microtensile pads having a thickness of about 0.6 em. and test regions measuring 2.54 mm. in widrh and 12.7 mm. in length were cut from the pads. Tensile screngths of the samples were measured at 25 C. and 100 C. with an Instron TM cable model instrument, using a pulling speed of about 51 mm. per minute. In addition, the melt flow races of che polymers were determined at 1500C., using rhe standard capillary and instru ment specified in ASTM 1238 70. The weight of the probe plus the added weight was 12.5 kilograms. Flow rates were measured electronically as probe displacement per minute and these results were converted to grams per 10 minutes using a conversion factor. The results are given inTable I. The first data column in Table I compares the melt flow rates at 150 C. of materials containing various monovalent quaternary ammonium counterions. It is apparent that the samples containing the long chain counterions Samples 1 , 2 and 4 have nrch higher melt flow and are softer than the short chain counterions Samples 5 and 6 . TABLE I PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF A SULFONATD EPDM CONTAINING VARIOUS MONOVALENT QUATERNARY AMMONIUM COUNTERIONS Melt Flow Rate Tensile Strength Sample Structure of 150 C, 250 psi psi Number Counterion g 10 min. 25 C 100 C 1 C18H37 2N CH3 2 0.020 1700. 70. 2 C2H5 3NT C18R37 0.030 1110. 60. 4 C18H37 N CH3 3 0.0085 5 N CH3 4 0.0030 6 N C2H5 4 0.0045 Higher melt flow usually results in easier melt processing such as by extrustion or injection molding. Softer elastomers tend to be more appropriate for applications requiring high degrees of flexibility and low stiffness such as, for example, hot melt sealants for joints which exper ience movement over time, or for gloves or shoe parcs which require high flexibility or softness. The difference in material properties which is caused by substituting quaternary ammonium counterions con raining long chain substituents for shorter chain sub stituents is more clearly illuscraved by direct comparison of the compositions in Table I. Sample 6 , containing the tetraethylammonium counterion gives a low melt flow rate of 0.0045 grams per 10 minutes. In one of the ethyl substituents of Sample 6 is replaced by an occadecyl substituent, Sample 2 is obtained. So, it is seen that the substitution of the long chain for the short chain re sults in an increase in melt flow by more than 6 times. Sample 5 , which contains the short methyl substituents on the councerion has a very low melt flow rate of 0.0030 grams per 10 minutes. Replacing one of the methyl groups with an octadecyl group gives Sample 4 it can be seen from Table I that Sample 4 has almost 3 times the melt flow rate of Sample 5 . If a second methyl substituent of Sample 5 is replaced by an octadecyl group, then Sample 1 is obtained. Sample 1 which contains the dioctadecyl dimethyl a nonium counterion has over six times the melt flow rate of the tetramethyl ammonium counterion. It is clear from these results that utilizing long chain substituents instead of short chains in a quaternary ammonium counterion results in materials having better processing higher melt flow rates , and which are weaker and softer.EXAMPLE 4 PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF A SULFONATED EPDM NEUTRALIZED WITH POLYVALENT QUATERNARY AMMONIUM COUNTERIONSA. A Divalent Quaternary Ammonium Counterion Sample 3 of Example 2 was neutralized with the diva lent cation 1 CH3 3 N CH2 10 N CH3 33 . Test pads of this material were compression molded at 160 C, and microtensile pads as described in Example 3 were cut from the pads. Tensile strengchs were measured at 250C and 100 C using a pulling speed of 51 mm. per minute. Also, the melt flow rate was measured using che method described inExample 3. The results were as follows Sample Number ..... 3 Structure of Counterion ........... CH3 3N Ch2 10N CH3 3Melt Flow Rate at 1500C, 230 psi .. 0.0035 g 10 minutesTensile Strenght at 25 C ........... 1820. psiTensile Strenght at 100 C........... 180. psi It is seen that this sample containing this divalent counterion has melt flow rate which is less than one half of the lowest flow rate long chain counterion sample of Table I. In fact, the melt flow race of this material is almost as low as the cecramechyl ammonium counterion sample Sample 5 of Table I .In addition to its low melt flow rate and resultant high melt strength the diva lent sample 3 has a high tensile strength than the values listed for the long chain counterion samples inTable I. In particular, Sample 3 has an excellent 100 C tensile strength. This sulfonated material neutralized with this diva lent ammonium counterion has a low melt flow rate and high tensile strength at elevated temperature even though its diva lent counterion contains a fairly long ten carbon chain. Higher tensile strengths are obviously desirable in many applications which subject an article to high stresses, such as hoses or flexible industrial belts.High melt strength can be desirable in some fabrication processes such as blow molding or blow forming of thin flexible sheets.B. A. Polyvalent Quaternary Ammonium Counterion Maznifloc 577C is a Polovalen Quaternary ammonium chemical having the structureEMI18.1 it has 2 n relatively low degree of polymerization. It is manufactured by the American Cyanamid Company. This material was converted to the hydroxide using the procedures cf Example 1, and it was used to neucralize a free acid sulfonated EPDM similar to that prepared in Example 2. A solution of this free acid containing 20g of polymer per liter of solvent had an acidity of 0.C057 milliequivalents of hydrogen per 100 ml. The neutralization procedure was similar to that used in Example 2.The isolation of the neutralized solfonated polymer from the solution was as follows. The solution was steam stripped co remove the solvencs and precipitate the ionomer as a crumb for about one half hour ac which cime the polymer had lose any tendency toward cackiness. The solids were filtered and washed in a Waring blender successively with methanol, discilled water and methanol. About 0.3 wt. Z of a hindered phenol antioxidant antioxidant 2246 was added to che polymer before each wash. The polymer crumb was air dried ac room cemperacure and further dried at room temperature under a vacuum. For comparison with this polyvalent quaternary ammonium councerion, tetrramethylammonium hydroxide was used for the polyvalent counterion. The neutralzation and isolacion procedures were similar to che ones used br che polyvalent counterion. Tensile measurements and melt flow measuremencs were made on the samples containing the polyvalent and tetramechyl ammonium counterions using the methods described in Example 3. It was found thac the sample containing the polyvalent quaternary ammonium counterion had a lower melt flow race, and higher censile strengths and modulii at both 25 C and 100 C as compared with the tetramethylammonium counterion.This demonstrates that a sulfonated polymer containing a polyvalenc ammonium counterion can result in lower melt flow and higher melscFength , and higher tensile strength and modulus than monovalent quaternary ammonium counterions of similar structure EXAMPLE 5 PREPARATION AND PHYSICAL PROPERIES OF A SULFONATED EPDM NEUTRALIZED WITH LONG CHAIN MONOVALENT AMINES An EPDM having a Mooney viscosity . L commat lG0 C 1 8 min. of about 20 was used as the starting material for making a lighcly sulfonated polymer.This EPDM con cained about 5 wt. of 5 echylioene 2 norbornene and it concained about 50 wc. of ethylene. It was sulfonatec using acetyl sulfate in accordance with the method d isclosed in U.S. Patent 3,836,511, to produce the free acid form of the polymer. This material was isolated by steam stripping and dried on a warm mill. This dried polymeric sulfonic acid was dissolved at a concencration of 30 gram per licer in a mixed solvent consisting of 93 toluene and 7 methanol by volume. By titration of an aliquot, che polymer was found co have an acidity of 25 milliequivalents of acid per 100g or polymer. The acid form of che lighcly sulfonated EPDM was divided into a number of portions, and different portions were neutralized in solution by the long chain amines listed below 7. C20,22H41,45NH2 8. C20,22H41,45N CH3 2 9. C20,22H41,45 2 N CH3 1C. C12H25 3NThe double subscripcs in Samples 7, 8 and 9 indicace that these materials contain a major amount of boch C20R41 andC22H45 in the long chain substituent s . These amines also concain a minor amount of C18H37 in their long chain substituent s . These three samples were obtained from the Humko Sheffield Chemical Company Sample 7 asKemamine P 190 D, Sample 8 as Kemanine T 1902 D, andSample 9 as Kemanine T 1901.Sample 10, tridodecylamine was obtained from the Eastman Chemical Company. Portions of the free acid sulfonated EPDM solution were slightly overbased with each of the above long chain amines by the addition of 1.15 equivalents of che longchain amine per equivalent of sulfonic acid. The solutions were stirred ac room temperature for about 20 minutes. The neutralized polymers were recovered rrc the solution by steam scripping and dried on a hoc tworool mill. Tensile pads were molded from che amine neu.ralized sulfonated EPDM s in che manner described inExample 3, and microtensile test dumbbells were cuc from the pads. Tensile strengths of the sulfonated EPDM s neutralized with the four long chain amines were measured at room temperature on an Inscron TM table model apparatus at a pulling speed of 51 mtn. per minute. In addition, melt flow rate measurements were made using the procedure described in Example 3. The results are shown in Table II.

This change also results in a soft material lower modulus and tends to reduce strength.In comparing Samples 8 and 9 of Table II it is observed thac substituting a long chain in place of a short chain sub stiruent further increases the melt flow rate, and further increases softness. The last sample 10, in Table II illustrates that the presence of additional long chain substituents, C12 in chis case, can be more important in increasing melt flow increasing softness then simply having a large amount of hydrocarbon in a lesser number of long chains e.g., Sample 10 with chree long chains but only 36 carbon atoms has greater melt flow and softness chan Sample 9 with over 40 carbon atoms. In order to determine the relative effects on physical properties of neutralizing an ionomer wich an amine containing a long chain substituant of cwelve carbons or more as compared with an amine of corresponding structure out containing shorter substituents, a short chain amine was utilized as a neutralizing agenc. Tripropylamine, N C3H7 3, was obcained from Aldrich Chemical Company.It was used to neutralize a portion or che free acid sul fonated EPDM described earlier in this example and it was worked up in exactly the same manner as the materials neutralized wich the long chain amines, and censile samples were prepared, and tensile and melt flow race measurements were made. The physical properties of the sulfonated EPDM neutralized with cripropylamine are presenced in Table III. For comparison, results for an amine of similar for chree hydrocarbon substituents of che same structure but having long 12 carbon chain substituents are also shown in Table III. It is seen that changing he propyl substituents of Sample 11 to dodecyl substicuents to gec Sample 10 has a dramatic effect on melt flow rate, strength, softness modulus , and elongation.The material neutralized with the amine containing the 12 carbon substituents tridodecylamine has over 5 times the melt flow rate of the sample neutralized with tripropylamine a lso, Sample 10 is much softer and has much higher elongation and much lower tensile strength. The much higher melt flow rate and greacer softness of the material neurralized with the long chain amine make it useful where high processing rates are desirable, such as in injection molding or extrusion. Also, these properties would be useful in caulking compounds and hoc melt sealancs.
