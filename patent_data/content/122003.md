## Abstract
A fluid jet assisted ion projection printing apparatus having a housing 78 including ion generation and ion modulation regions. A bent path channel 76 , disposed through the housing, directs transport fluid with ions entrained therein adjacent an array of modulation electrodes 74 which control the passage of ion beams from the apparatus. The modulation electrodes are sup ported upon a planar substrate, and include a first portion 74 , extending in the plane of the substrate, and a second portion 72 , which is either coplanar or departs from the plane of the substrate by an angle of less than 45 . The width of the bent channel is chosen to provide laminar flow therethrough so that ions will not be lost to the channel walls as the transport fluid negotiates its way along the bent path.
