# Refined electrical insulating oil and oil filled electrical appliances.

## Abstract
A refined electrical insulating oil and oil filled electrical appliances impregnated therewith. The electrical insulating oil is quite suitable for use in oil filled electrical appliances in which insulating materials or dielectric materials made of plastics are employed. The electrical insulating oil is prepared by refining a mixture of unsaturated dimers of styrenes and alkylbiphenyls and or alkylnaphthalenes, using a solid acidic substance.
