# Composition of polyester resin.

## Abstract
Compositions comprising high molecular weight poly ester resins, especially poly alkylene terephthalate resins, and graft derivations of ethylene propylene terpolymers are compatible over a broad range of amounts. The resultant blends are processable into shaped articles which have a very glossy surface, and they also substantially retain the mechanical properties of the polyester resins alone.

## Description
COMPOSITION BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to compositions comprising blends of polymer resins. More particularly, it relates to blends of high molecular weight linear polyesters and copolyesters of glycols and terephthalic and or isophthalic acid with graft derivatives of ethylene propylene terpolymers. With the development of molecular weight control, the use of nucleating agents and two step molding cycles, poly ethylene terephthalate has become an important constituent of injection moldable compositions. Poly l,4 butylene terephthalate , because of its very rapid crystallization from the melt, is uniquely useful as a component in molding resins. The latter is commercially available e.g. VALOR0 GeneralElectric Co. . Work pieces molded from such polyester resins, alone or combined with reinforcements, in comparison with other thermoplastic, offer a high degree of surface hardness and abrasion resistance, high gloss, and lower surface friction. Grafted derivatives of ethylene propylene diene terpolymer and compositions of such polymers with other resins are known in the art and described in the patent literature. Several of them are commercially available e.g. ROVES Uniroyal, Inc. . It has been disclosed, for instance, that olefinic copolymers and terpolymers can be grafted with styrene, styrene acrylonitrile, methyl methacrylate, styrene methyl methacrylate and, blended e.g., with styrene acrylonitrile copolymer resins, to provide thermoplastics which can be molded, extruded or vacuum formed into articles having good tensile and impact strengths. Polymers and blends of these types and methods of their preparation are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,166,081 and U.S. PatentNo. 4,202,948.Thermoplastic resin blends of polysulfone resin and graft derivatives of ethylene propylene terpolymers are also described in U.S. Patent No.3,641,207. It has now been discovered that graft derivatives of ethylene propylene non conjugated diene terpolymers as described can be blended with polyesters to obtain advantageous properties after molding. Surprisingly, such properties are obtained over a wide range of compositions. Especially noteworthy are the retention of gloss in the blends and enhanced resistance to environmental stress cracking and crazing. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to the present invention there are provided thermoplastic compositions suitable for extrusion, molding, or shaping by other means into various articles, comprising an admixture of a a polyester resin, and b an ethylene propylene non conjugated diene interpolymer grafted with the homopolymer or copolymer of monoethylenically unsaturated monomers as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,202,948, for example, styrene, styreneacrylonitrile, methyl methacrylate or styrene methyl methacrylate, halostyrenes, alpha methylstyrene, p methylstyrene acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, the lower alkyl esters of acrylic and methacrylic acid, styrene maleic anhydride and the like. The compositions are moldable into parts, pieces and articles which possess a very glossy surface.Mechanical properties such as impact strength are comparable to those of conventional polyester blends.The compositions are able to tolerate the presence of stress cracking agents, such as gasoline, and or other additives which normally attack or otherwise have a harmful effect on polyesters. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Preferred for use as component a in the compositions of this invention are high molecular weight polyester resins, especially poly C1 C4 alkylene terephthalate resins. The polyester resins suitable for use in the practice of this invention are available commercially or can be prepared by known techniques, such as by the transesterification of esters of terephthalic acid with ethylene glycol or butanediol followed by polymerization or by heating glycols with free acids or with halide derivatives thereof or by similar processes.These are described in U.S. Patent No. 2,465,319 toWhinfield, et al. , in U.S. Patent No. 3,047,539 toPengilly , and elsewhere in the literature. Special mention is made of poly l,4 butylene terephthalate resin which is available from GeneralElectric Company under the trade designation VALOR0 resin, poly ethylene terephthalate resin, and mixtures of the two resins. They may contain minor amounts, e.g., from 0.5 to 15 mole percent of the total repeat units, of other aliphatic linkages, e.g., those of from 2 to 10 carbon atoms, such as dimethylene, trimethylene, hexamethylene, decamethylene, and the like, linkages, as well as cycloaliphatic, e.g., 1,4 cyclohexanedimethylene linkages. In addition to the terephthalic acid units, other dicarboxylic units, such as adipic, napthalene dicarboxylic, isophthalic and orthophthalic units may be present in small amounts, e.g., from about 0.5 to about 15 mole percent of the total acid units. Preferably, the foregoing polyester resins will have an intrinsic viscosity of at least about 0.2 deciliters per gram as measured in 60 40 phenol tetra chloroethane at 30 C., for poly ethylene terephthalate , and at least 0.6 deciliters per gram, same basis for poly l,4 butylene terephthalate . Component b is a resinous composition of the homopolymer or copolymer of monoethylenically unsaturated monomers as disclosed in U.S. Patent No.4,202,948 grafted to a rubbery terpolymer comprising copolymerized units of ethylene and propylene and a non conjugated diolef in diene . The non conjugated dienes used in the preparation of the terpolymer elastomers may include open chain non conjugated dienes, such as 1,4 hexadiene and also cyclic especially bridged ring non conjugated dienes such as dicyclopentadiene, 5 methyl 2 norbornene, 5 ethylidiene 2 norborne, and 1, 4 cyclooctadiene. The respective weight ratio ethylene to propylene in the elastomer may range from 40 60 to 75 25. The content of the additional monomer, such as the non conjugated diene in the terpolymer can range from about 1 to about 20 by weight. The preferred diene is 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene. Methods for the preparation of the foregoing rubbery terpolymers are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,933,480 3,000,866 and 3,000,867. The resin forming monomers useful for copolymerization with the described rubbery copolymers and terpolymers include styrene, g methylstyrene, p methylstyrene and other alkyl ring substituted styrenes and acrylics such as acrylonitrile, acrylates and alkacrylates. The ester portion of the acrylate is generally alkyl from one to about eight carbon atoms, inclusive, preferably one to about six carbon atoms, inclusive.The alk portion of the alkacrylate is alkyl of one to three carbon atoms, inclusive. Examples of acrylate and alkacrylate include ethylacrylate, n butyl acrylate, 2 ethylhexylacrylate, methylmethacrylate, propylethacrylate and isopentylpropacrylate. Mixtures of styrenics and acrylates can also be employed. Especially preferred are mixtures of styrene and acrylonitrile. As explained above, the graft copolymers are prepared by polymerizing the resin forming monomers, e.g., styrene and acrylonitrile, in the presence of the rubbery terpolymer, e.g., ethylene propylene diene. In one procedure, the rubbery copolymer or terpolymer is dissolved in an inert organic solvent, e.g., benzene, to form a cement, to which is added the desired amount of resin forming monomers and a radical initiator, e.g., peroxide. The mixture is heated to decompose the initiator and to polymerize the monomers. The graft copolymer which results is isolated, e.g., by precipitation with an antisolvent such as methanol. The evidence indicates that at least a portion of the resin grafts onto the rubber to form a graft copolymer made up of a rubbery spine or backbone polymer and resinous side chains. The proportion of resin forming monomers to rubber used in the graft polymerization can vary, for instance, from 1 4 to 4 1 on a weight basis. The graft copolymers and methods of their preparation are described in greater detail by F.X. O Shea ln U.S Patent No. 3,642,950, by Albert Fournier, Jr. andCharles Paddock in U.S. Patent No. 4,166,081 andPeascoe in U.S. Patent No. 4,202,948. Suitable materials are also available commercially fromUniroyal, Inc. Co., Naugatuck, Connecticut under the trade designation ROVE 0 resins. Components a and b are compatible in widely variant proportions, for example, from 5 to 95 parts by weight of a and from 95 to 5 parts by weight of b , per 100 parts by weight of a and b combined, with particular amounts being dependent on specific requirements. The compositions can also include one or more other ingredients, such as supplementary non resinous additives conventionally employed with polyester resins and blends of such resins. Examples include mineral fillers, e.g., clay, talc, mica, etc., reinforcing agents, e.g., fibrous or flaked glass, graphite whiskers, aluminum shavings, wollastonite, titanate whiskers, carbon filaments, etc. pigments, dyes processing aids stabilizers antioxidants and so forth.These materials can be added in conventional amounts, e.g., from 1 to 50 by weight of the total composition. Preparation of the compositions may be accomplished by tumble blending components a , b , and any other ingredients, extruding the blend and then injection molding the extrudate. The mode of preparation is not essential, however, and other well known procedures for preparing molded polyesters can be utilized.
