# Liquid phase synthesis of hexafluoroacetone.

## Abstract
A process for the preparation of hexafluoroacetone which comprises contacting, in the liquid phase, hexa fluorothioacetone dimer in the presence of an aprotic solvent containing a catalytic amount of an alkali metal fluoride with a gaseous oxidant selected from the group consisting of air, O₂, O₃, NO₂ and NO is disclosed. The preferred aprotic solvent is dimethylformamide, and the preferred gaseous oxidant is O₂.
