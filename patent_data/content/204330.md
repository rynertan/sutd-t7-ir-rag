# Dynamic vibration absorber.

## Abstract
An elliptical inner frame 12a is supported in a ring shaped outer frame 10a , as a body of a dynamic vibration absorber, by means of first coil springs 14 which are stretch ed in an X direction. A weight 12 is supported in the inner frame 12a by means of second coil springs 14a, 14a which are stretched in a Y direction. Thus, the second coil springs 14a and the mass of the weight 12 form a Y direction dynamic vibration absorber unit 22 , while the first coil springs 14 and the respective masses of the weight 12 and the inner frame 12a constitute an X direction dynamic vibra tion absorber unit 21 .
