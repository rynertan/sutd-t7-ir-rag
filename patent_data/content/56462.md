# Electromagnetic fluid pump.

## Abstract
This invention relates generally to fluid pumps of the type which may be used, for example, to aerate water in an aquarium. Specifically, the pump of the invention comprises an electromagnet motor unit 14 including an electromagnet 70 for producing a reversing magnetic field to drive a fluid pump unit including a pump casing 32 and a flexible diaphragm 16 defining a fluid pumping chamber 18 . A permanent magnet 30 is carried by the flexible diaphragm and is alternately repelled and attracted by the magnetic field to displace the diaphragm to expand and contract the pumping chamber.
