# TESTING OF ENVELOPES USED IN THE RETREADING OF TYRES

## Abstract
A stripped tyre 10 is placed on a rim 12 with a curing tube 14 located between the tyre and rim. A pre cured tread 16 is then placed around the tyre and an envelope 18 is placed around the tyre and tread. The envelope is clamped and sealed against the side wall of the tyre by flange plates 20 . The envelope is tested for leaks, either in its wall or in its mounting against the tyre, by evacuating air through an envelope valve 19 , stopping the evacuation of that air and then observing a guage indicating the pressure between the tyre tread and the envelope.
