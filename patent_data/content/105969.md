## Description
The field of the inyention concerns security documents having defeating indiciR for effective protection against counterfeiting. Considerable effort has been directed to provide a security document difficult to counterfeit. Means were sought whereby the geriuineriess of the security document can be effectively discerned. In order to be acceptable, the means only should be detectable under limited circumstances, and should otherwise be undetectable. Acceptable means should be capable of encoding. When detected, such means should have a clear and unmistakable presence, should withstand wear, aging and other physical impairment of the substrate and should be economically feasible. The code should not be obviously visible, should not be capable of application by standard printing techniques, should be applicable to various types of substrates employed to form document of a security nature, should require high cost, highly specialized equipment for application, yet provide a document only marginally increased in cost over the non coded product. Further, the coating of which the code is formed must be formed of a material which is non toxic, stable, and detectable with low cost equipment. Accordingly, the invention thus provides a method of detecting the presence of a coating upon a printed substrate comprising a document of value the coating is solely machine detectable as a measure of electrical capacitance between a plate electrode and a portion of said coating. The invention thus further provides a printing medium for forming the security document, the printing medium having a machine detectable mark including a substrate of a first material forming thet mark and deposited on a portion only of one surface of the substrate, characteri7ed in that particles of the second material are embedded at limited locations in said first material including a subsurface region under the coating, said second material being only detectable by electrical capacitance detection. Still further, the invention provides a security document of value having a mark detectable by apparatus responsive to a particular physical characteristic of the mark and thereby distinguishable from a counterfeit document lacking such a mark characterized by a substrate of a first material free from said physical characteristic, a mark defining coating of a second material having said physical characteristic, said coating consisting of a particulate generally invisible very thin layer sputterdeposited on a portion only of one surface of the substrate and a sub surface region below said thin layer formed of discrete particles of said second material embedded within said first material under said coating, as a continuation of said thin surface layer, the physical characteristic of said particulat material being eIec trical capacitance, said second material being visually nondetectable but its presence capable of being sensed only by said detecting apparatus and visually observable matter printed on said document.

Figure 20 is a diagrammatic flow diagram of the process for handling a web through the process of forming the security document according to the invention Briefly, a coating is applied to a substrate.The coating hazes a physical characteristic which is machine only detectable but otherwise is invisible. The defectable physical characteristic preferably is electrical capacitance.The coating may be applied in a prescribed pattern, in continuous bands along the one dimension of the document , in combination with printing, overprinting or the like, or alone, and constitutes a code. Further, the first or characteristic containing coating may be overlaid with a second coating in partial or full registry therewith. Portions of the first coating, that is, particles thereof, enter the substrate below its surface by being driven thereinto during deposition of the said coating. By machine only detectable it is meant that the coating is not visible and can only be detected by some detecting machine,i.es is not observable to the naked eye. Referring now to the drawings, in Figures 1 and 2 a security document, in the form of a stock certificate, is indicated generally by reference character 1 and comprises a substrate 2 and a coating in the form of three bands 3, 4 and 5 deposited on a portion thereof. Substrates may be formed of paper, that is a porous fibrous cellulosic material, or may comprise a spunbound polyolefin composition,e.g. polyethylene or polypropylene such as marketed under the trademark TYVEK by the E. M. DuPont DeNemous Company and or is described inUnited States Patent 3,169,899 Steuber . The coating must have a distinctive physical characteristic, e,g., electrical conductivity, resistivity, etc. which is absent from the substrate.The deposit of said coating on the substrate can be effected at any time subsequent to formation of the substrate. It may be accomplished by use by coating apparatus as shown in diagrams or by a modification of the apparatus as shown in the patent to Kuehnle, No. 3,829,373 entitled THIN FILEI DEPOSITION APPARATUS USING SEGMENTED TARGET MEANS . The coating apparatus which deposits the bands 3, 4 and 5 of electrically conductive material, such as indium tin oxide at specific locations on substrate 2 The bands, and particularly the location the reo f, consti tute a code which identifies the finished document as a genuine document and also can serve as a code representing denominational values. In the illustrated example, which is a stock certificate for 100 shares, the location coda is a bar code in which both the width and number of bars are significant.The code identifying the number of shares consists of a wide band 3 and two narrow bands 4 and 5, as illustrated. The invention is applicable to all documents of value, including currency. Substrate 2 carrying bands 3 4 and 5 thereafter is printed with words or other indicia required to complete the finished document 1 The printing of such documents is commonly done by an itaglio printing process, in which the substrate material is forced under high pressure into inked recesses in a printing plate, so that the material of the substrate is raised in ridges under the ink, as shown at 2a in Figure 2. The bands 3, 4 and 5 have a thickness preferably less than 200 Angstrom units, and are transparent and invisible.The ink deposited on the substrate during the printing process typically has a thickness, including the raised ridge in t substrate, of about 0.002 . Thus, the ink thickness is about twenty thousand times the thickness of the conductive bands 3, 4 and 5, as indicated by the dimensions X and 2G 000 X inFigure 2. The contours of the inked letters as shown in cross section at 6 in Figure 2, are variable when viewed on a scale such as that employed for the vertical dimensions in Figure 2. The contours shdwn at 6 in Figure 2 are idealized. Some of the particles of the coating material are driven into the substrate during the coating process and penetrate the substrate to a considerable depth, forming sub surface re gions 8 Figure 2 . Regions 8 are much thicker than the coatings 3, 4 and 5. For example, the depth of penetration of the particles may range up to about 6,000 X where X is the thickness of the sputtered coating. The density of distribution of the penetrated particles is greatest near the surface of substrate 2, said density decreasing inversely with the depth of penetration. Preferably, the thickness of the coating bands 3, 4 and 5 should not exceed about 200 Angstrom units so that the coating is as thin as possible with maintenance of its integrity. Generally, the coating thickness is limited to that which would make the coating readily visible. In some instances, even a visible coating may be acceptable or even desirable. With some coating materials, the thickness can be greater than 200 Angstrom units without the coating becoming visible. It is important that the likely counterfeiter be unaware of the presence of the code. Where the coating material is indium tin oxide, the coating is not visually apparent at a thickness of 200 Angstom units. Further, reduction in coating thickness is an economic benefit in speeding the coating process. Referring to Figure 3, a security document 10 differs from the document represented by reference character 1 in that the document 10 is printed first and the characteristic coating represented by reference character 7 is applied thereafter. Thus the inke d letters appear to provide characters 7 having the coating bands 10 , 11 and 12. The banks 10 , 11 and 12 cover some of the inked letters completely.The particles which penetrate the letters during the coating process do not go all the way through those letters, since the ink ley er is thicker than the maximum depth of penetration of the particles. Both the coated bands 3, 4 and 5 and 10 , 11 and 12 can be detected either conductively, inductively or capacitatively preferably, capacitive detection is elected. Referring to Figure 4, the substrate 2 of Figure 2 is illustrated but the overprint 6 is absent. Such a material can be prepared as a printable sheet material in condition for printing to make same into a document of value. In Figure 5, the substrate 13 has been supplied with a coating 16. A second coating 17 is applied to the opposite surface of the substrate 15. Both coatings 16 and 17 may be electrically conductive, and each may be detected separately and conductively by apparatus including spaced contacts which physically engage one coating. Inductance or capacitance means would detect both coatings at the same time, and could be used if the two coatings and the detecting apparatus were designed to cooperate. This is desired. The document 20 of Figure 6 carries a coating 20 and the second coating 21, which partially overlaps the coating 20. Either coating 20 or 21 may be electrically conductive and the other ndn conductive. Alternatively, both coatings may be electrically , conductive. Using the two coatings of different materials both electrically conductive, enables the conductivity of the combined coatings to be controlled so that the conduc tivity remains within predetermined limits. The document 22 of Figure 7 carxies coating 23 completely overlapping coating 22 . Again, eithe r or both coatings may be electrically conductive. If only the coating 22 is electrically conductive, sensing by contact is not possible but so that sensing must be effedted by capacitive measurements, Since the coatings 20 and 21 are of different materials, the characteristics of the substrate 13 in regions under. only one coating, as at 20a, will be different from the characteristics in re g ions under the overlapped coatings, as at 21a. This difference is indicated by the different representations used in the Figure for the two regions.Similar differences in the characteristics of the substrate are indicated, in similar manner, in Figure 7. In Figure 8, a coated substrate is illustrated on which a coded electrically conductive coating is applied in spaced regions such as bands 24, with the spaces between the bands 24 being covered with a second coating 25 of a different and electrically nonconductive material. Since all surfaces of the substrate 13 are coated, the same external gloss or texture appears throughout the surface of the resulting document. The location of the conductive bands 24 cannot be determined by visual observation. Substantially all materials capable of being electrically deposited produce coatings which, in the preferred thickness range, have the same visual appearance. Thus it is not difficult to select a material for coating 25 which visually matches the code coating 24. Figure 9 illustrates a printable, coated substrate 30 carrying a first coded coating 32 deposited on portions of the substrate 30 and another coating34 has been deposited on the entire surface of the substrate. The whole surface of the substrate 30 is of the same appearance with the location of the coded coating 32 concealed from visual observation. In Figure 10 substrate 30 is illustrated wherein the uniform coating 35 is deposited first on the entire surface of the substrate 30 and the coded coating 36 is applied over only a portion of the coating 35. The coatings 35 and 36 are selected to be substantially the same in visual appearance, so that the location of the coded coating is not visually detectable. Figure 11 shdws a modified embodiment of the invention wherein a first coating 41 covers selected portions of the substrate 40 and a second coating 42 covers other selected portions, partially overlapping the first coating 41. The two coatings 41, 42 are detectable separately because of different characteristic s in the two coatings. One of the coatings 41,42 may be electrically conductive. Referring to Figures 12 and 13, there is illustrated a process for placing a coded coating on a web of material to be printed and thereafter printing security documents of value on the web, so as to make sure that the printed data, such as the denomination, on the documents corresponds to the code represented by the coating. A roll of sheet material, shown at 260, is first passed through a margin printer 61 where, at spaced locations on at least one margin of .th e web, there is printed data identifying the denom ination to be printed. The web then is passed throu gh apparatus 62 for. coating the document with a denominationally coded coating 68 corresponding to the markings on the margin. The coating 68 can be in the form of bands, as shown.The coated web represented by reference character 63 then is transferred to printing press 64 Figure l3 where documents 65 are printed on the web. The resulting printed web, whi ch may have been cut into sheets, passes to an inspection station whe re it is determined that the printing on the document 65 corresponds to the code and to the information printed in the margins.The web or sheets then pass to a trimmer 66 which cuts off the mar, gins 67. The coated bands, 3, 4 and 5 may be detected either conductively by apparatus having contacts which engage the bands, or inductively or capacitively, by apparatus that does not contact the bands 3, 4 and 5. While it may appear that the ink letters 6 inFigure 2 would interfere with a conduCtivecontact with the bands 3, 4 and 5, it should be noted that the bands are much wider than the printed letters 6, and that the bands 3, 4 and 5 are continuous. Hence, conductive contacts made at spaced points on any of the bands 3, 4 or 5 may be utilized to measure the conductivity of the band between those contact points. The surface finish of the contact probes which engage the bands 3, 4 and 5, should have a range of variation of smoothness of the same order of magnitude as the thickness of the printed letters 6, so that some points on the contact probes engage the bands, even though the printed letters intervene between the probes and the bands.The problem described above with respect to the contact with the bands 3, 4 and 5 does not exist with coatings 10, 11 and 12 since the latter are placed over the printed letters 7. Where the anti counterfeit protection coatings are ,deposited on documents sub3ect to substanti al wear, the conductivity of the material decrea ses , and hence its impedance increases, as the coating and possibly the underlying substrate, becomes worn. The measurement of impedance may be used as a measure of wear. For example, in a given document, a range of 5K 1OK ohms would indicate that the document was genuine, while an impedance in the 9K 10S range would indicate that the document should be retired from circulation. Referring to Figure 15, the document 39 comprising the coated substrate 40 of Figure 11 with the inked letters printed on it passed through detecting apparatus 43 for detecting the first coating 41 and is forwarded to a location 44 marked PASS if the required coating is found and is diverted to a second location marked FAIL if the required coating is missing. In Figure 15, the same document 39 is passed through detecting apparatus 47 which detects only the second coating and either forwards it to a PASS location 48, or diverts it to a FAIL location 49. In Figure 16, the document 39 travels successively through an apparatus 43 for detecting the first coating and an apparatus 47 for detecting the second coating. The document must be passed by both detectors 43 and 47 in order to reach the PASS location 50. Failure of either coating to be detected results in diversion of the document to one of the FAIL locations 51 and 52. The encoding coatings described herein preferably have a thickness of 200 Angstrom units but may include those from 56 Angstrom units to 3 00 Angstrom units in thickness. Measurement of capacitance functions as the preferred det ecting method and can provide quantitative measurements useful in determining deominational information. Capacitance measurement is effective even after the document hÅas been exposed to steart , hot water and repeated abrasion or other abuse. In addition to the use of Indium Tan Oxide, very thin films of Tin Oxide Antimony oxide were deposited. Figure 17 is a diagrammatic flow representation illustrating the process for applyin g the coating such as shown in Figure 4. In that process, the substrate is passed to a first encoding coating apparatus 14 and thence to a second coded coating apparatus 15. Figure 18 illustrates the process of applying a uniform coating over a c oded coating. The substrate 30 is passed into and through an encoding coating apparatus 31 and from there, is taken through the uniform coating apparatus 33. A flow diagram comprises Figure 20 to the coating of paper, for example, to provide the security document in accordance with the invention. Other substrates may be able to use less eqaborate apparatus. If a spunbound olefin sheet is used, the var ious vacuum pumping steps described below may be considerably simplified, and to some extent even eliminated since this material has much less absorbed gas and moisture than paper sheet. The continuous web 100 to be coated is supplied from a unit 101 which may include two alternately used web supply reels and a splicer, and the n passes through a tension control 102, an aligner 103, a web cleaner 104, a static eliminator 105, and a web quality test and marker unit 106. The web quality test and marker unit may be a photoelectric apparatus which scanS the web for holes , slimy spots and other impQrfe ctions, ,and marks the web in one margin adjacent any such imperfection. The web then passes through a web break detector 107 which control s a web driving motor 110 and an associated brake, so as t6 stop the motor and apply the brake quickly when a break in the web is detected. The eb the n passes through an accumulator 111, comprising a set of opposed pairs of rolls whi ch accumulates a substantial length of web . A coating apparatus 112 just beyond the accumulator along the path of the web and is evacuated to a very low pressure. The repair of a break in the web is facilitated if the web is stopped with the break outside the coating unit 112. The accumulator 111 stores a sufficient length of web so that the web can be stopped with the break in the accumulator, or elsewhere outside the coating unit 112. If the web is so stopped, the coating unit 112 does not have to be opened to repair the broken web. The web leaving the coating apparatus 112 moves through a coating quality test and marking unit 113, which murks a margin of the web wherever the coating is inadequate. Preferably, this test and marking unit marks the margin of the web opposite to the margin marked by the web quality test and marking unit 106. The web then passes through a tension control and aligner unit 114, similar to the units 102 and 103. The web thereafter passes through a humidifier 115 which restores the paper web to its normal moist condition so that it will be suitable for printing. Dehumidified paper tends to be brittle and to break up during printing. If the material of the web is other than paper the humidifier 115 may not be necessary. The web 115 passed from the humdifier to a printer 116, which prints a value code in the margins as des cr ibed in connection with Figure 12.The web then passes to a trimmer and cutter 117, which removes excess margin material and cuts the web transversely into she ets. The sheets pass to a set of quality mark detectors 121. These detectors sense the marks applied to the web by the web quality tester 106 and by the coating quality tester 113. One lox the det ectors respon ds to marks applied to one margin by the web quality tester 106 and directs those rej edted she e Es to a first stacker 123.The other detector responds to marks applied by the unit 113 and directs those rejected sheet s to a second stacker 123.Sheets which pass both the quality mark detectors are delivered to a stacker 124 where the correctly coded sheets are accumulated. If desired, all sheets rejected, for whatever reason, might be discha r,ged into the same stack. While a singly continuously receiving stacker 124 for the, good sheets is indicated, a pair of alternately receiving stackers may be used in place of stacker 124. The encoding coating preferably is applied to the substrate employing r.f. cathode sputtering techniques, including a cathode electrode formed of the material being sputtered. An anode or biased electrode is placed on the opposite side of the substrate. The two electrodes are supplied with electricity at radio frequency and at high voltage 6000 volts or more . The coating chambers are filled with argon or other inert gas at a very low pressure, so that it is ionized by the hic,th electric field. The ions are toward and impinge on the cathode and sputter material particles there from. The particles are attracted toward the bias electrode during the ha lf cycles when the electrodes are of the proper polarity.The particles sputtered from the electrode by the impinging ions travel in a straight line toward the bias electrode, and are inte r ceped by the substrate. The particles accumulate on that surface as a coating or in some cases penetrate the web for a substantial distance, so that the interface between the coating and the web forms a very strong bond. The material particles which are driven by the applied high voltage may be energized with thousands of volts, and hence can be dr iven below the surface of the web. Typically, penetration depths range from 50 to 150 Angstrom units per thousand electron volts. Thus a graded interface is formed, even when the web and the coating material are mutually insoluble. The interface between the coating and the web can be so diffused that it is impossible to determine where the coating ends and the web begins. Such an interface provides an especially strong bond between the coating and the web.
