# CONTINUOUS VULCANISED ASSEMBLY PROCESS

## Abstract
A continuous vulcanised assembly process for produc ing an anti fouling material comprises cleaning the surface of a sheet of copper alloy anti fouling material by shotblast ing, use of a rotary abrasive member or by a chemical treatment. A layer of elastomeric material is extruded onto the metallic material and the elastomeric material is then cured at an elevated temperature using a rotary press. The material thus produced can be stored on reels for subse quent attachment to appropriate structures.
