# Sheet feeder.

## Abstract
A sheet feeder uses a signal shinger wheel 20 for feeding sheets in a shingled fashion from a stack. The stack is contained between a fixed guide plate 90 and a movable guide plate 91 which is adjustable to accommodate differently sized sheets. In order to minimise skew, the shingler wheel is coupled, by a cable and pulley system 150, 152, 154, 156, 140 to the movable plate, centre it which respect to the stack when the plate is adjusted.
