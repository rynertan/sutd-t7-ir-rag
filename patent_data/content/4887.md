# Method and device for synchronizing digital transmissions via satellite.

## Abstract
In a method and a device for synchronizing with the on board timing of a regenerative satellite information symbols regenerated with the timing of the emitting earth stations, in time division multiplex access digital transmissions, there is effected a frequency conversion, so as to bring to the nominal on board operation frequency the frequency of the regenerated signal, and a phase correction at the transitions between adjacent bursts, so as to eliminate phase discontinuities in the symbol sequence sent to the on board processing device.
