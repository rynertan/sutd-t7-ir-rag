# DISTRIBUTED LOGIC CONTROL SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATION LOOP

## Abstract
A distributed logic control system and communication loop embodies an orchestrater computer 11 containing part of the system logic and a plurality of station computers 13,27, 42, 55, 69 containing part of the system logic. The orchestra ter computer and station computers are connected in a com munication loop 15, 29, 40, 57, 71, 79 . Each station computer controls at least one work station. The orchestrater computer continually time division multiplexes information packets con taining bytes that have different bit setting privileges asso ciated with them. A status byte has assigned privileges, and a command byte and data byte have alterable privileges. The or chestrater computer 11 and any station computer 13, 27, 42, 55, 69 can independently shut down the system prior to failure upon detection of a fault.
