# Method and apparatus for off loading an uncured tyre from a tyre building drum.

## Abstract
A completed, shaped and uncured tire is off loaded from the tire building machine 10 on which the tire has been built by first engaging the completed tire coaxially within a ring 14 having radially movable segments and then moving the ring 14 with the tire coaxially off the building machine 10 to a chucking device 20 engageable with the inner peripheries of the respective bead portions of the tire. The ring 14 is then expanded and moved coaxially from the tire and the chuck ing device 20 now holding the tire is rotated to place the tire axis in vertical orientation and elevated to a position above the tire machine 10 where the exterior surface of the tire is grasped by a pair of palms 32 mounted on a swing arm 33. After the chucking device 20 is moved downwardly clear of the tire, the tire is then moved horizontally by the swing arm 33 and deposited on an overhead belt conveyor to be trans ported thereby to further processing. The tire building machine operator is relieved of the effort and time required for manual removal of the tire and the completed tire is pro tected from inadvertent damage due to manual handling. In particular, the tire is elevated from the operating floor in a convenient and expeditious manner.
