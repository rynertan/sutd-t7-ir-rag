# Temperature controlled valve mechanism and method.

## Abstract
The invention provides a temperature controlled valve mechanism 10. The mechanism includes a valve housing 12 having a valve inlet 23 for connection with a fluid source. A valve outlet 24 in the housing is used for draining fluid from the housing. Valve closure members 30 and 32 are supported for movement toward and away from the valve outlet bet ween closed and open positions, the valve closure member blocking and closing the valve outlet when in the closed posi tion. Biasing means 36 urge the valve closure member away from the closed position. Means 16 defining an expansion chamber 42 are provided in the housing, including means 48, 50, 52 and 53 for moving the valve closure member to the closed position against the force of the biasing means upon entry of a pressurized medium into the expansion chamber. The valve mechanism further includes temperature activated venting means 45 for venting and depressurizing the expan sion chamber upon occurrence of a predetermined tempera ture. The venting of the expansion chamber causes the bias ing means to rapidly move the valve closure member from the closed position, causing the valve mechanism to be opened.
