# A machine for wrapping tape about an article.

## Abstract
A machine is disclosed for wrapping tape about an article in which a supply of tape with adhesive on one side thereof is fed across a pair of spaced stationery jaws along a feeding platform and cut to a size for the bundle to be wrapped. The bundle to be wrapped is placed in the jaws, and against the tape, while holding bars, that reciprocate in the jaws, engage the ends of the tape, and move the tape upwardly about the bundle. Pincher jaws are provided and are located across the upstanding ends of the tape. The jaws squeeze the two ends together to secure the bundle and ejecting means move the bundle out of the jaws.
