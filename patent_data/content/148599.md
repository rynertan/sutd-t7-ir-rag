# FUEL NOZZLE WITH INTERMEDIATE SWIRL CIRCUIT

## Abstract
A fuel nozzle assembly including a nozzle 22 connected to a holder and selectively supplied with primary and secondary liquid fuel through inlet pipes 14, 16 and gas or other fluids through ducts 18,21 . A discharge oriface 33 of the nozzle 22 provides a spray from a primary atomizer 52 and a swirl plate 72 , either alone or separately. The spray pattern is defined and atomized by air flow from an air swirl annulus 59b and a passageway 53 . An annulus 66 provides a swirling gas flow that is mixed with air flow from the air swirl annulus 59b . Alternatively, the annulus 66 provides a supplemental air flow to atomize the liquid spray.
