# Process for the preparation of omega carbalkoxy n alkyl dialkyl amines.

## Abstract
Process for the preparation of omega carbalkoxy nor.alkyl dialkylamines having a linear alkyl chain, compris ing the steps of amination of allyl compounds in which at least an allyl carbon atom is a part of a cyclopropane ring which contains one or two carboxyl or carbalkoxy groups on the carbon atom which is adjacent to the ally carbon, or is a part of a lactone ring, in the presence of catalysts consisting of triarylphosphine complexes of palladium, or trialkyl phosphite complexes of nickel, and the subsequent hydroge nation of the unsaturated amine thus obtained. By so doing, interesting linear amines are obtained, which contain car boxyl units or carbalkoxy units, said amines being useful as additives for the industry of synthetic fibres viscosity stabilizers for polycaprolactam .
