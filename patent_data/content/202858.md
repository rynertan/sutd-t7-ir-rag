## Description
The present invention relates to a multilayered ceramic wiring circuit board with a high density interconnection therein and suitable for direct mounting of semiconductor components of silicon and gallium arsenide so as to constitute a functional module and more particularly to a ceramic Insulating substrate layer for the multilayered ceramic wiring circuit board and the method of producing the same. A mulitilayered ceramic wiring circuit board may include a plurality of ceramic insulating substrate layers laminated integrally, conductor layers with predetermined patterns supported on the respective ceramic insulating substrate layers and via hole conductors provided at predetermined positions of the respective ceramic insulating substrate layers for interconnecting the respective predetermined patterned conductor layers to form a predetermined wiring circuit. Simultaneous firing of the ceramic insulating substrate layers, the conductor layers, and the via hole conductors for completing the multilayered ceramic wiring circuit board, particularly one with a high density interconnection therein, often causes cracking in the ceramic insulating substrate layers due to the difference in thermal expansion coefficients between the ceramic insulating substrate layers and the conductor layers and the via hole conductors. Especially when alumina with a firing temperature 1500 1650 Further, with the increasing tendency of speed up and high density of integrated circuits such as LSI made of silicon, a method of mounting the silicon LSI directly on the multilayered ceramic wiring circuit board has recently come into use for purpose of heat dissipation and speed up of semiconductor devices. This mounting method, however, gives rise to problems in that with the increase in size of the silicon LSI, the thermal stress at the junctures between the silicon LSI and the multilayered ceramic wiring circuit board caused by a temperature change during the mounting of the silicon LSI on the multilayered ceramic wiring circuit board increases. Alumina is generally used for the conventional multilayered ceramic wiring circuit board as explained above, the thermal expansion coefficient of which is 75 x 10 ⁷ Further the alumina multilayered wiring circuit board lowers the electrical signal propagation speed, because the dielectric constant of alumina is so large as 9.5 at 1MHZ . U.S patent 4,460,916 discloses ceramic insulating substrate layers for the multilayered ceramic wiring circuit board, essentially consisting of crystals of mullite and crystals of cordierite occupying the interstices between the crystals of mullite. Since the thermal expansion coefficient of mullite and cordierite are 42 45 x 10 ⁷ Furthermore, semiconductor components made of gallium arsenide have been widely used recently. The thermal expansion coefficient of the gallium arsenide semicondutor components is 65 x 10 ⁷ The present invention provides a multilayered ceramic wiring circuit board including a plurality of ceramic insulating substrate layers laminated integrally, conductor layers with predetermined patterns supported on the respective ceramic insulating substrate layers and via hole conductors provided at predetermined positions of the respective ceramic insulating substrate layers for interconnecting the respective conductor layers with predetermined patterns to form a predetermined wiring circuit, the conductor layers and the via hole conductors being made of either tungsten or molybdenum wherein A preferred embodiment may enable one to provide ceramic insulating substrate layers for a multilayered ceramic wiring circuit board having a thermal expansion coefficient between that of silicon and gallium arsenide thus permitting the direct mounting of semiconductor components made of silicon and or gallium arsenide on the multilayered ceramic wiring circuit board without breaking of wires at the solder juncture caused by the thermal stress due to the thermal expansion coefficient difference. A preferred embodiment of the present invention may provide ceramic insulating substrate layers for a multilayered ceramic wiring circuit board having a dielectric constant below 6.7 and a high mechanical strength. In another aspect the invention may provide a method of producing ceramic insulating substrate layers for a multilayered ceramic wiring circuit board having thermal expansion coefficient of 36 65 x 10 ⁷ Preferred ceramic insulating substrate layers for the multilayered ceramic wiring circuit board of the present invention essentially consist of crystals and mullite 3Al₂O₃, 2S The method of producing ceramic insulating substrate layers for a multilayered ceramic wiring circuit board of the present invention comprises steps of mixing more than 70 wt , preferably 70 80wt , more preferably 72wt , of mullite powder having an average particle size below 5µm, 10 30wt , preferably 15 30wt , more preferably 25 27wt , of silicon dioxide powder having an average particle size below 2µm, less than 15wt , preferably 1 5wt , more preferably 1.0 2.0wt of aluminum oxide powder having an average particle size below 1µm, and less than 1wt , preferably 0.4 0.8wt of metal oxide powder of at least one selected from the group consisting of alkali metal oxide and alkaline earth metal oxide pressing and forming the mixture and firing the pressed and formed mixture at a temperature above where the firing shrinkage ratio thereof becomes constant, preferably 1550 1680 The thermal expansion coefficients of mullite and sillimanite are 42 45 x 10 ⁷ Further since the dielectric constant of these crystals are 6 7 at 1MHZ , the dielectric constant of the resultant ceramic insulating substrate layers may be reduced below 6.7, thus the signal propagation speed of the multilayered ceramic wiring circuit board of the present invention may be increased. The addition of silicon dioxide S Silicon dioxide S In respect to the amount of silicon dioxide to be added, it was found that when the raw materials, the mixture, except for mullite, contain more than 75wt of silicon dioxide, a better effect is brought about. Aluminum oxide Al₂O₃ is used as a sintering additive for mullite in the mixture and produces sillimanite, andalusite and kyanite together with mullite and silicon dioxide in the mixture. Alkali metal oxide and alkaline earth metal oxide improve sintering degree but an increase in amount thereof produces crystalline phase and or non crystalline phase of oxide complexes formed by the metal oxides and silicon dioxide and or aluminum oxide and thereby lowers the mechanical strength of the resultant ceramic insulating substrate layers, further the dielectric constant of the oxide complexes is large which increases the dielectric constant of the resultant ceramic insulating substrate layers. Therefore it is required that the total amount of alkali metal oxide and alkaline earth metal oxide is less than 1 wt and does not exceed the solid soluble limitation in mullite, sillimanite, andalusite and kyanite. In other words, it is necessary to form ceramic insulating substrate layers which do not contain the crystalline phase of alkali metal oxide and alkaline earth metal oxide. In the ceramic insulating substrate layers which contain more than 1wt alkali metal oxide and alkaline earth metal oxide, the firing shrinkage ratio varies in the temperature range in which the firing is sufficiently conducted, which fact made it impossible to obtain a stable sintered body i.e. the ceramic insulating substrate layer, because of the unstable crystalline phases in the sintered body, which was confirmed by X ray diffaction. Examples of alkali metal oxides are oxides of lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium and cesium and examples of alkaline earth metal oxide are oxides of berylium, magnesium, calcium, strontium and barium. Alkali metal oxide and alkaline earth metal oxide are materials which are very unstable in atmosphere, and if they are left to stand, they absorb water and the like. For this reason, when these oxides are added, they are added in the form of carbonates or hydroxides. Carbonates and hydroxides decompose in the process of heating up, and release carbon dioxide and water, respectively. At this time the oxides become active and improve sintering degree. In manufacturing a multilayered ceramic wiring circuit board, it is necessary first to form green bodies, forming conductor layers on each of them, and simultaneously firing a multiplicity of the laminated green bodies. As such a method, the green sheet method, slip casting method, mold forming method using press method, injection mold method, etc. are known. The green sheet method is a method of forming a green sheet by means of a green sheet producing apparatus with doctor blades after adding a solvent and a thermoplastic resin to a raw material powder, and deaerating the stirred slurry. The slip casting method is a method of forming a green sheet by adding water, a dispersing agent and a thermoplastic resin to a raw material powder, and pouring the stirred slurry into, for example, a gypsum mold. The mold forming method by pressing is a method of forming a green sheet by adding a solvent and a thermoplastic resin to a raw material powder, mixing and stirring by an attrition mill or the like, sieving and granulating it, pouring it into a mold and pressing it. The injection mold method is a method of inject molding the raw material powder to which a thermoplastic resin, wax or the like is added. An embodiment of a multilayered ceramic wiring circuit board according to the present invention will be described with reference to Fig.1, which shows the cross section of the embodiment. The reference numeral 1 denotes a ceramic insulating substrate layers and horizontal thick lines indicate conductor layers 2 supported on the substrate layers 1. These conductor layers 2 are connected by predetermined via hole conductors 2 which are indicated by vertical thick lines. The reference numeral 4 denotes a Kovar pin connected by a gold indium solder 5, and 6 denotes semiconductor components which are connected by a solder 7 to multilayered ceramic wiring circuit board 3. An embodiment for the method of manufacturing a multilayered ceramic wiring circuit board according to the present invention will here be explained. Hereinunder, part means part by weight and means wt . 72 parts of mullite powder 3Al₂O₃ 2SiO₂ which is slightly rich in alumina and has an average particle diameter of 2µm, 25.3 parts of quartz powder SiO₂ of 1µm in average particle diameter, 1.9 parts of alumina powder Al₂O₃ of 0.4µm in average particle diameter, 0.8 part calculated in terms of MgO of magnesium carbonate Mg₅ CO₃ ₄ OH ₂ 4 H₂O and 5.9 parts of polyvinyl butyral of 1,000 in average polymerization degree, which is used as a resin, are put into a ball mill and dry blended for 3 hours. To the mixture, 1.9ml of butylphthalyl butyl glycolate as a plasticizing agent, 46 parts of trichloroethylene, 17 part of tetrachloroethylene and 18 parts of n butyl alcohol as solvents are added, and these were wet blended for 20 hours to make slurry. Air bubbles were removed from the slurry by vacuum deaeration, and the viscosity was controlled. The slurry was next coated on a polyester film base which had been subjected to silicon treatment in thickness of 0.23mm by means of a doctor blade, and dried by an over to form a ceramic green sheet. The ceramic green sheet was removed from the polyester film base which had been subjected to silicon treatment and was cut at an interval of 220mm. The ceramic green sheet produced in this way was cut into 200mm x 200mm by means of a green sheet puncher and provided with holes for guides. Thereafter, the ceramic green sheet was fixed utilizing the guide holes and via holes having a diameter of 0.15mm were made at predetermined positions by a punching method. A conductor paste consisting of tungsten powder, nitrocellulose, ethylcellulose, polyvinyl butyral and trichloroethylene in weight ratio of 100 3 1 2 23 was filled in the via holes formed in the ceramic green sheet, and was printed in accordance with a predtermined circuit pattern by a screen printing method. Such green sheets were laid one upon another in the total number of 30 as shown in Fig.1, with the via holes on each green sheet in alignment with the respective via holes, and pressurized at a temperature of 120 The multilayered ceramic wiring circuit board manufactured in this way was subjected to electroless nickel plating and gold plating, and thereafter the Kovar pins 4 were connected to the board with a gold indium solder 5 by an ordinary method using a carbon jig. The semiconductor component 6 with its face down was connected to and mounted directly on the multilayered ceramic wiring circuit board with the solder 7. In this way, a functional module shown in Fig.1 was manufactured. The thermal expansion coefficient of the ceramic insulating substrate layers used for the multilayered ceramic wiring circuit board was 50 x 10 ⁷ The tensile strength of the Kovar pin was more than 4kg pin, high enough to fit for paractical use. No breakig of wire was produced at the solder juncture 7 of the semiconductor component 6 even after more than 2,000 heat cycle tests between 65 The signal propagation delay time of the internal wiring conductive material was 8.1ns m This value corresponds to the dielectric constant 6.2 of the ceramic insulating material. In a conventonal multilayered wiring circuit board composed of a sintered body which essentially consists of alumina, the dielectric constant of the ceramic insulating material is about 9.5 and the signal propagation delay time is 10.2ns m. This means that the signal propagation delay time was reduced by about 20 according to this embodiment. Multilayered ceramic wiring circuit boards were manufactured in the same way as in Embodiment 1 except that the compositions of the ceramic raw material powder were as shown in Table 1 wt . The alkali metal oxide and the alkaline earth metal oxide in Table 1 are shown by calculation of carbonates or hydroxides in terms of oxides. The functional module shown in Fig.1 was manufactured in the same way as in embodiment 1. The additive materials except for mullite were used as a sintering additive. Table 2 shows the content wt of the Al₂O₃ SiO₂ phases in each of the ceramic insulating substrate layers obtained and Table 3 shows the content wt of glass component therein. The main component in each of the layers obtained is mullite, and MgO is dissolved in mullite or Al₂O₃ SiO₂, and the amount of the solid solution does not exceed 1 calculated in terms of MgO. If the value exceeds 1 , another crystalline phase is unfavorably formed and the thermal expansion coefficient thereof is different from that of the base crystals. Fig.2 shows the relationship between the SiO₂ content in the sintering additives and the bending strength of the boards which contain 70 wt mullite No. 1 to 7 and those which contain 80 wt mullite No. 22 to 28 . The four point bending method on the basis of JIS was adopted for the bending test. It is obvious from Fig.2 that the bending strength has a tendency to rapidly increase with the increase in glass content. The bending strength is more than 180 MPs when the SiO₂ content in the sintering additive exceeds 80 wt , if the mixture contains 70 wt mullite, and when the SiO₂ content in the sintering additive exceeds 75 wt , if the mixture contains 80 wt mullite. Fig.3 shows the relationship between the amount of SiO₂ added and the bending strength. As shown in the graph, addition of SiO₂ improves the sintering degree of mullite and rapidly enhances the mechanical strength. Fig.4 shows the relationship between the amount of Al₂O₃ to be added and the bending strength. As is obvious from the graph, addition of Al₂ O₃ rapidly lowers the strength. Therefore the amount of Al₂O₃ to be added is preferably 5 or less. The relationship between the amount of SiO₂ in the sintering additive and the dielectric constant is shown in Fig.5. In this graph, the mullite content is 70 wt or 80 wt . The dielectric constant was measured at a constant frequency of 1 MHz. The dielectric constant shows the tendency to decrease with the increase of the SiO₂ content in the sintering additives. When the mullite content is 80 wt , the dielectric constant is less than 6.7, if the SiO₂ content in the sintering additive is more than 85 wt , and when the mullite content is 70 wt , the dielectric constant is less than 6.7 even if the SiO₂ content in the sintering additive is about 50 wt . Fig.6 shows the relationship between the dielectric constant and the amount of SiO₂ to be added. Addition of SiO₂ greatly lowers the dielectric constant. Especially, it is rapidly lowered when more than 15 SiO₂ is added, therefore addition of more than 15 SiO₂ is preferable. Fig.7 shows the relationship between the firing temperature and the firing shrinkage ratio of each sample. It is clear from the graph that the sample of Embodiment 1 has a constant shrinkage ratio at a temperature above 1580 The relationship between the amount of Al₂O₃ to be added and the amount of Al₂O₃ SiO₂ produced in the ceramic insulating substrate layers is shown in Fig.8. As is clear from the graph, with the increase in additive amount of Al₂O₃, Al₂O₃ SiO₂ increases. These results show that the bending strength is high and the dielectric constant is small when the SiO₂ content in the sintering additives is more than 80 wt , if the mullite content is 70 wt , and when the SiO₂ content in the sintering additives is more than 85 wt , if the mullite content is 80 wt . X ray diffraction was conducted in order to identify the crystalline phases in the sintered body of each of the ceramic insulating substrate layers having these compositions. When the content of alkaline earth metal oxide MgO is more than 1 wt , Al₂O₃ MgO and 2Al₂O₃ 2Mgo 5SiO₂ are produced in the process of firing, many crystalline phases including Al₂O₃, MgO and SiO₂ but difficult to identify as well as those of 3Al₂O₃ 2SiO₂ and Al₂O₃ SiO₂ are formed in the vicinity of 1,600 On the other hand, when the alkaline earth metal oxide MgO is less than 1 wt , Al₂O₃ MgO and 2Al₂O₃ 2MgO 5SiO₂ are formed together with the large amount of SiO₂ added in the process of firing, but in the vicinity of 1,600 On the other hand, if the total amount of alkaline metal oxide and alkaline earth metal oxide is less than 1 wt , the bending strength is more than 180 MPa, and the dielectric constant is less than 6.7. In addition, the crystalline phases after firing are stable and in firing temperature above 1,550 The thermal expansion coefficient of the ceramic insulating substrate layers having the composition shown in Table 1 is in the range of 40 to 60 x 10 ⁷ In the samples having the composition in which the total amount of the alkali metal oxide and alkaline earth metal oxide is less than 1 wt Table 1 , the tensile strength of the Kovar pin was more than 4kg pin, high enough to fit for practical use. No breaking of wire was produced at the solder juncture of the semiconductor component even after more than 2,000 heat cycle tests between 65 The signal propagation delay time through the internal wiring conductors was below 8.4 ns m. This value corresponds to the dielectric constant 6.7 of the ceramic insulating substrate layers. A ceramic insulating substrate layer of alumina has the dielectric constant of about 9.5 and the signal propagation delay time is 10.2 ns m. This means that the signal propagation delay time was reduced more than 17 according to this embodiment.
