# EPOXY GRAFT ACRYLIC WATER BASED PRIMER SURFACERS

## Abstract
Dispersion of an epoxy ester graft acrylic in water with a total of no more than 5 of organic volatiles and amines. These dispersions can be used in primer compositions for metal substrates having a minimum of organic solvent emis sions and which can crosslink at temperatures from 140 200 C, giving a good balance of hardness, flexibility, humidity, corrosion resistance and anti chipping properties.
