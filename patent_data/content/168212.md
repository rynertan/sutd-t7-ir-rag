## Description
The present invention relates to a coloring material comprising an alcohol as a main solvent component and a process for the preparation thereof. This coloring material comprising an alcohol as a main solvent component is very valuable as a coloring material, paint or ink for wooden articles, paper and fibers. As a coloring material comprising an alcohol as a main solvent component and a dye as a colorant, there are known compositions comprising a dye, an alcohol soluble resin and an alcohol, as disclosed in Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. 54 37539 and No. 57 1555 and Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 59 41369. In these known coloring materials comprising an alcohol as a main component, as the alcohol soluble resin, there are used shellac, a maleic acid resin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, a phenolic resin, a ketone resin and polyvinyl butyral. These resins, however, act only as the binder, and dyes are merely dispersed in these binder resins. Accordingly, the following problem arises in known coloring materials of this type. Namely, when a basic dye is used as the colorant, though the basic dye is excellent in the color abundance and color sharpness over other dyes, the light fastness is poor and the coloring material comprising the basic dye has poor light resistance. DE 12 31 711 discloses a coloring material comprising a basic dye, alcohol and an alcohol soluble copolymer. C.A. column 73, no. 6, page 52, Abstract no. 26582y discloses the addition to basic dyes of polymethacrylic acid and polystyrenesulfonate. It is a primary object of the present invention to provide a coloring material comprising a basic dye as a colorant and an alcohol as a main solvent, with improved light resistance. In one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a coloring material comprising a solution of an alcohol soluble copolymer having a sulphonic acid group or a salt thereof, which is dyed with a basic dye, in a solvent comprising an alcohol as a main component In another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a process for the preparation of coloring materials, which comprises the steps of In still another aspect of the present invention there is provided a process for the preparation of coloring materials, which comprises the steps of The alcohol soluble resin the the coloring material of the present invention acts not only as a binder but also as part of a colorant. Therefore, the coloring material exhibits improved light resistance while effectively utilizing the characteristics of the basic dye such as color abundance and color sharpness. An alcohol soluble resin having a sulfonic acid group or a salt thereof, which is used in the present invention, may be prepared according to various processes. For example, there may be adopted a process in which a known resin is sulphonated to obtain an alcohol soluble resin and process in which an ethylenically unsaturated sulphonic acid or a salt thereof is copolymerized with a comonomer capable of providing an alcohol soluble resin. Copolymerization of an ethylenically unsaturated sulphonic acid or a salt thereof will now be described. As the ethylenically unsaturated sulphonic acid or its salt that is used for the production of the colored polymer of the present invention, one of the following unsaturated sulphonic acids is used styrene sulphonic acid, vinylbenzyl sulphonic acid, vinyl sulphonic acid, allyl sulphonic acid, methallyl sulphonic acid, acryloyloxy ethyl sulphonic acid, As the copolymerizable monomer capable of providing an alcohol soluble resin, one of the following is used hydroxy ethyl acrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, hydroxypropyl acrylate, hydroxypropyl methacrylate, polyethylene glycol monomethacrylate, ethyl acrylate, ethyl methacrylate, propyl acrylate, propyl methacrylate, butyl acrylate and butyl methacrylate. At least one member selected from the above mentioned ethylenically unsaturated sulphonic acids and salts is copolymerized with at least one member selected from the above mentioned copolymerizable monomers. The mixing ratio may be voluntarily selected. However, if the proportion of the ethylenically unsaturated sulphonic acid or its salt is too high, the solubility in an alcohol is reduced. Accordingly, in order to obtain a coloring material having a dense color, As such comonomers, there can be mentioned monoethylenically unsaturated monomers, for example, acrylic acid esters such as methyl acrylate, 2 ethylhexyl acrylate, n hexyl acrylate, cyclohexyl acrylate, n octyl acrylate, dodecyl acrylate, tetradecyl acrylate, glycidyl acrylate, aminoethyl acrylate and diethylaminoethyl acrylate methacrylic acid esters such as methyl methacrylate, n hexyl methacrylate, cyclohexyl methacrylate, n octyl methacrylate, 2 ethylhexyl methacrylate, dodecyl methacrylate, tetradecyl methacrylate, glycidyl methacrylate, aminoethyl methacrylate and diethylaminoethyl methacrylate vinyl esters such as vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate and vinyl benzoate ethylenically unsaturated acids and their anhydrides such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, maleic acid, maleic acid anhydride, fumaric acid and itaconic acid acrylic and methacrylic amides and their derivatives such as acrylamide, methacrylamide, N methylolacrylamide, N n butoxymethylacrylamide and N methoxymethylacrylamide styrene and 3,4 dichlorobutene and diene monomers such as butadiene, chloroprene and 2,3 dichlorobutadiene. The polymer of the present invention can be obtained by polymerizing the foregoing monomers in water or a solvent comprising an alcohol as a main component in the presence or absence of a basic dye, if necessary in the presence of a surface active agent, a dispersant or the like, by feeding these components collectively, separately or continuously together with an ordinary radical polymerization initiator, for example, a persulfate such as potassium persulfate or ammonium persulfate or an organic peroxide such as cumene hydroperoxide or t butyl hydroperoxide to a polymerization vessel under agitation. The polymerization may be carried out at a temperature lower than the boiling point of the medium. The molecular weight of the the polymer obtained according to this polymerization process depends on the concentrations of the monomers present in the polymerization system, the amount of the radical polymerization initiator used and the polymerization temperature. The monomer concentration may be freely selected, but the monomer concentration is generally 3 to 50 and preferably 10 to 30 . Polymerization at a high monomer concentration results in increase of the viscosity of the polymerization system and removal of the polymerization heat becomes difficult. Accordingly, too high a monomer concentration is not preferred. Furthermore, too low a monomer concentration is not preferred from an economical viewpoint. As is apparent from the object of the present invention, the process for the preparation of the polymer is not limited in the present invention. In the case where polymerization is carried out in water in the absence of a basic dye, the polymer obtained by polymerization is dyed with a basic dye. As the basic dye the term basic dye is used in a broad sense in the instant specification so that even a cationic dye is included , there can be mentioned a triphenylmethane dye, an azo dye, a methine dye, an oxazine dye and an anthraquinone dye. Dyeing can be accomplished by an ordinary method. For example, there may be adopted a method in which the pH value of an aqueous liquid of the polymer is adjusted to 2 to 7, preferably 3 to 5, by an organic acid such as formic acid, acetic acid, buytric acid, tartaric acid or malic acid, an inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid or an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate, and then an aqueous solution of a basic dye is added to the aqueous liquid of the polymer. Subsequently, the resulting solution is dissolved in an alcohol, or water is removed from the resulting solution by spray drying, drying under reduced pressure or other ordinary drying, washing and drying are performed according to need and then the dyed polymer is dissolved in a solvent comprising an alcohol as a main component, whereby the intended colored polymer solution is obtained. Alternatively, the colored polymer solution may be obtained by adding a solution of the above mentioned dye in an alcohol to the aqueous liquid of the polymer. In the case where polymerization is carried out in a solvent comprising an alcohol as a main component, neutralization is carried out in the same manner as described above after polymerization and the above mentioned dye is added. Incidentally, in this case, a colored polymer solution can be directly obtained by carrying out polymerization in the presence of the basic dye. In this case, in view of the stability of the dye against fading and discoloration, it is preferred that polymerization be carried out at a pH value of 2 to 7. At any rate, in the present invention, the conditions for dyeing the polymer with the basic dye are not particularly limited. The concentration of the thus prepared colored polymer solution can be appropriately selected according to the intended use, but the concentration is ordinarily adjusted to 1 to 50 by weight, especially 3 to 30 by weight. Too high a concentration is not practically preferred because the viscosity of the solution is too high, and too low a concentration is not preferred from an economical viewpoint. The solvent used for the preparation of the coloring material of the present invention is predominantly comprised of an alcohol, namely, comprises 50 to 100 by weight of an alcohol and 0 to 50 by weight of water or other organic solvent. As the alcohol that is used in the present invention, there can be mentioned monohydric alcohols such as methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, n propyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, n butyl alcohol, sec butyl alcohol, tert butyl and isobutyl alcohol, polyhydric alcohols such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butylene glycol, triethylene glycol and glycerol, and monoalkyl ethers of these polyhydric alcohols such as monomethyl ethers and monoethyl ethers. Water may be contained in the coloring material in an amount not rendering drying difficult. For example, when the coloring material is used as an ink of an overhead projector sheet or the like, the coloring material may contain water in an amount of up to 20 by weight. The organic solvent which may be used in combination with an alcohol includes, for example, a volatile organic solvent such as xylene, toluene, n butyl acetate, ethyl cellosolve, methylethyl ketone or methylisobutyl ketone. The coloring material of the present invention is useful as a coloring material, paint or ink for wooden articles, paper and fibers. The present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the following examples that by no means limit the scope of the invention. A polymerization vessel was charged with 40 g of ethyl acrylate, 2.1 g of 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropane sulphonic acid and 100 g of ethyl alcohol in a nitrogen current, and the temperature was elevated with stirring. When the temperature was elevated to 80 C, addition of a catalyst solution of 1 g of azoisobutyronitrile in 100 g of ethyl alcohol was started and dropwise addition was performed over a period of 3 hours to effect polymerization. Then, reaction was further conducted for 3 hours to obtain an ethanol solution having a polymer concentration of 16.4 by weight. Then, 3 g of an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide having a concentration of 10 by weight was added to the reaction mixture. Then, 1.0 g of Cathilon Brilliant Red 4GH cationic dye supplied by Hodogaya Chem. Co., Ltd. was added, and the mixture was stirred at 70 C for 1 hour to obtain a colored polymer solution according to the present invention. Even if a film obtained by drying this colored polymer solution was washed with water, the film was kept colored in red. The polymer solution was coated on a writing paper sheet of JIS P 3201 by using a 1 mil doctor blade, and the light fastness of the coating was tested by a xenone fade ometer at a black panel temperature of 65 C 3 C, and a relative humidity of 35 C 5 . The discoloration degree was evaluated by using a blue scale of JIS L 0841. It was found that the light fastness of the dye per se was about class 1 of the blue scale but the light fastness of the colored polymer solution was class 3. A colored polymer solution was prepared in the same manner as Example 1 except that the polymerization was carried out in the absence of 2 acrylamido 2 methyl propane sulphonic acid. All other conditions remained substantially the same. When a film obtained by drying this colored polymer solution was washed with water, the dye was washed away. The light fastness of the colored polymer solution was class 1. A polymerization vessel was charged with 34 g of water in a nitrogen current, and the temperature was elevated to 90 C. A monomer solution comprising 117 g of 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate, 20.6 g of 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropane sulphonic acid and 467 g of water and a catalyst solution of 10.8 g of ammonium persulfate in 34 g of water were added dropwise over a period of 3 hours to effect polymerization. Subsequently, polymerization was further conducted for 2 hours at 90 C to obtain an aqueous solution having a polymer concentration of 20.2 by weight. The pH value of the thus obtained aqueous polymer solution was adjusted to 5 by an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide having a concentration of 10 by weight. An aqueous dye solution comprising 0.5 part of acetic acid, 10 parts of water and 0.5 part of Cathilon Blue 5GLH cationic dye supplied by Hodogaya Chem.

The obtained aqueous colored polymer solution was dried to obtain 10.3 g of a colored polymer. The colored polymer was dissolved in 40 g of ethyl alcohol to obtain a colored polymer solution having a polymer concentration of 20 by weight. When the light resistance of the thus obtained colored polymer solution was examined in the same manner as described in Example 1, it was found that the light fastness of the polymer solution was class 3 higher than the light fastness of the dye per se, which was class 1. When a felt pen was impregnated with the colored polymer solution and letters were written on a commercially available white board or overhead projector sheet by this felt pen, it was found that the written letters could be cleanly erased by rubbing with a wet cloth. A polymerization vessel was charged with 30 g of ethyl alcohol in a nitrogen current, and the temperature was elevated to 80 C. A monomer solution of 50 g of 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate in 70 g of ethyl alcohol and a catalyst solution of 2 g of azoisobutyronitrile in 100 g of ethyl alcohol were added dropwise over a period of 3 hours to effect polymerization. Subsequently, polymerization was further conducted for 2 hours at 80 C to obtain an ethanol solution having a polymer concentration of 20.0 by weight. Then, Cathilon Blue 5GLH was added in the same manner as Example 2. The light resistance of thus obtained colored polymer solution was class 1. When letters were written on a commercially available white board or overhead projector sheet in the same manner as Example 2, it was found that the written letters could not be cleanly erased by rubbing with a wet cloth and a blue color was spread out.

When the temperature was elevated to 80 C, addition of a catalyst solution of 1 g of azoisobutyronitrile in 50 g of ethyl alcohol was started and drowise addition was performed over a period of 3 hours to effect polymerization. Then, the reaction was further conducted for 3 hours to obtain an ethanol solution having a polymer concentration of 18.2 by weight. To 100 of the thus formed solution was added 1.5 g of Cathilon Yellow 3GLH cationic dye supplied by Hodogaya Chem. Co., Ltd. .
