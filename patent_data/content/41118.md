# DRIVER CIRCUIT FOR AN ELECTROMAGNETIC DEVICE HAVING A COIL AND A MOVABLE ARMATURE

## Abstract
A driver circuit for an electromagnetic device having a coil and a movable armature, e.g. a solenoid, is capable of driving the device at a fast cycling rate while dissipating little power. In response to an actuating signal applied to a transis tor 22 , a capacitor 23 connected to a high voltage source 24 supplies a high level current to the coil 13 of the elec tromagnetic device for a short time until the capacitor is charged. Thereafter, a resistor 26 connected to a low voltage source 27 , supplies a low level current to the coil, thus minimizing power dissipation. In response to the cessation of the actuating signal, a transistor 28 connected across the capacitor turns on, and acts as a low impedance in parallel with the capacitor, to rapidly discharge the capacitor. Once discharged, the capacitor again may supply high level current to the device when a fresh actuating signal is applied to the transistor 22 .
