# Charge transfer apparatus.

## Abstract
A charge transfer device is described which includes a plurality of charge transfer channels or shift registers 1 N N 2N , each having at least two sections operable at two different clock frequencies f1,f2 to provide variable non symmetrical time delays in the channels and which may be operated with another identical charge transfer device to pro vide the functional equivalence of a single charge transfer device having twice as many channels and providing sym metrical time delays in the channels.
