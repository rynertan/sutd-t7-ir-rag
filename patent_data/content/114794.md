# Support wheel for a domestic appliance, particularly for a washing machine.

## Abstract
In a support wheel unit 10 for a domestic appliance, preferably a washing machine, a support wheel 16 is rotatably supported on a shaft 17 which is secured to two arms 12, 13 of a support member 11 which is connected to the base 32 of the machine. The wheel 16 comprises two rollers 20,21 which engage with the sides of a tyre 23 made of a compressible material and forming the supporting surface of the wheel. The rollers 20,21 are rotatably arranged on the shaft 17 and cooperate with the arms 12,13 to axially compress the tyre 23 , thereby applying a braking force to the wheel.

## Description
Support wheel unit for a domestic appliance, particularly for a washing machine The present invention relates to a support wheel unit for a domestic appliance of the kind indicated in the preamble of the appending Claim 1. It has been proposed to provide cookers, washing and dish washing machines, for example, with support wheels in order to make easier the movement of such appliance on a supporting surface, e.g. the floor of a kitchen. As far as washing machines are concerned support wheels may involve problems as to stability. These problems are caused by the unbalance forces which very often occur during spin drying and which cause displacement of the machine over the floor. US 2,866,222 discloses a castor for a washing machine which has a castor wheel in the shape of a polygon. With such a shape of the wheel displacement caused by unbalance forces is greatly reduced. DE 1,760,594 discloses a similar construction in which a triangular support wheel has been used to achieve sufficient stability of a washing machine during spin drying. However, in both of the cited references the support wheel can rotate freely on a shaft when disengaged from the supporting surface. Accordingly, in case of large unbalance forces, the appliance may still move on the supporting surface. US 1,863,349 suggests another way of preventing the rotation of a castor wheel, namely by the application of a braking force to the wheel. The reference discloses an arrangement which includes parts that engage with the wheel to lock it when in a position of rest. A separate operating means is provided operating the locking parts to release the castor wheel for rotation. The object of the invention is to remedy the drawback connected with the use of supporting wheels in a domestic appliance, e.g. a washing machine, and to provide a support wheel for use with such an appliance that is effectively prevented from being rotated by a braking force continuously applied to the wheel. The object is achieved in connection with a support wheel having the characteristic features included in the claims. Preferably but not necessarily, the support wheel has the shape of a polygon and by applying a braking force to the wheel the rotation preventing effect caused by this specific shape of the wheel will be increased. An embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a section through a support wheel unit according to the invention, Fig. 2 is a side view of the unit of Fig. 1, Fig. 3 is a schematic view of a washing machine provided with support wheel units according to Figs. 1 and 2, and Fig. 4 is a detail view showing the securing of a support wheel unit to the base plate of the washing machine of Fig. 3. In Fig. 1 a support wheel unit is generally referred to by numeral 10. The unit comprises a frame or support member 11 which has a pair of support arms 12, 13.Means are provided for securing the unit 10 to the base plate 32 of a washing machine 33, and, as shown in Fig. 3, preferably four wheel units are connected, one at each corner of the base plate. The said means comprises a lug 14 inserted in a hole 34 in the base plate and a hole 15 which cooperates with a hole 35 in the base plate. The support wheel unit is secured to the base plate by a screw joint 36 extending through the holes 15 and 35. A wheel generally denoted by 16 is rotatably supported on a shaft 17 mounted in the support arms 12, 13 and secured in place by lock washers 18, 19. The wheel consists of two rollers 20, 21 which together form a support surface 22 for a tyre 23, made of a compressible material, preferably rubber. The rollers have annular flanges 24, 25 which extend radially and engage with side portions 26, 27 of the tyre 23.Axially extending annular flanges 28, 29 on the rollers 20, 21 engage with surfaces 30, 31 on the support arms 12, 13. By the engagement between the flanges 28, 29 and the surfaces 30, 31, respectively, the tyre is compressed causing a biassing force which presses the respective roller against the corresponding surface. The tyre has octogonal shape providing eight flattened surfaces around its periphery. When a washing machine provided with support wheels of the kind described above is in its permanent position the engagement between the flanges 28, 29 and the surfaces 30, 31 will effectively restrict rotation of the wheels due to unbalance forces during spin drying operation of the machine. This frictional braking effect will add to the rotation restricting effect caused by the octagonal form of the tyre 23. In case the machine is to be moved on the floor to another position, e.g.for service, only a slightly increased force is needed to cause such movement of the machine and no operating levers or the like need to be operated to release the support wheels for rotation.
