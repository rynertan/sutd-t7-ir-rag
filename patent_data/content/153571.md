## Description
Process for Preparing Solid Acetyl Phosphate Sa1 Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a solid lithium salt of acetyl phosphate, more particularly, monoacetyl phosphate, by the use of orthophosphoric acid hereinafter referred to also as phosphoric acid or its salt as a raw material. Certain salts of monoacetyi phosphate, for example, dilithium salt, diammonium salt, disodium salt or lithium potassium salt, are known to serve as a substrate of acetate kinase and therefore can be used in enzymatic reactions in which adenosine triphosphate ATP takes part.The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of the salts of monoacetyl phosphate that can be used in such a field. Up to this time, salts of acetyl phosphate to be used in enzymatic reactions have been prepared by comparatively complicated processes. According to the present invention, the product salts of a high purity can be obtained by a process which comprises merely reacting phosphoric acid or its salt with acetic anhydride as an acetylating agent and lithium ion as a precipitating agent without complicated separation sequences required in the prior art.Background of the Invention It is known that the acetylation of phosphoric acid by the use of an acetylating agent such as acetic anhydride or ketene can give mixtures of monoacetyl phosphate and diacetyl phosphate, occasionally further containing triacetyl phosphate. A crystalline salt of monoacetyl phosphate to be used in the above enzymatic reaction can be separated from these mixtures. Representative methods include a process for the preparation of diammonium acetyl phosphate which comprises acetylating 100 phosphoric acid with acetic anhydride in ethyl acetate and pouring the reaction mixture into chilled methanol saturated with ammonia G. M. Whitesides et al., J. Org. Chem. 44, 864 .However, this method involves an operation at low temperatures, i.e. 30 to 100C, and the formed diammonium acetyl phosphate tends to decompose in the presence of excess ammonia, so that the reaction conditions must be strictly controlled in order to carry out the separation by filtration smoothly. Alternatively, salts of acetyl phosphate can be obtained in the form of an aqueous solution from the above acetylation reaction mixture D. C.Crans and G. M. Whitesides, J. Org. Chem. 48, 3130 32 , but the product is inconvenient for the storage or the use as compared with the solid one, because acetyl phosphate hydrolyses in an aqueous solution. It is also known that a salt of phosphoric acid is acetylated with acetic anhydride to obtain a salt of acetyl phosphate, as described in West German Patent No. 2831831 our East German Patent No. 144546. In these patents, acetic anhydride or its mixture with acetic acid was used as a medium, and the examples disclosed in these patents demonstrated that when the acetylation of sodium or potassium phosphate was carried out in acetic anhydride or its mixture with acetic acid in which sodium or potassium phosphate can not be dissolved, the reaction proceeded to the stage of diacetyl phosphate. Accordingly, as described in the latter half of the East German Patent, solvolysis with alcohol etc. was necessary to obtain monoacetyl phosphate from the diacetyl derivative. Up to this time, the acetylation of lithium phosphate was disclosed only in the West German Patent No. 2831831.According to Example 1 of this patent, a solution of lithium hydroxide 12 parts or 0.5 molar part in acetic anhydride 408 parts or 4 molar parts is added dropwise to a mixture of 100 phosphoric acid 49 parts or 0.5 molar part and acetic anhydride 204 parts or 2 molar parts in a nitrogen atmosphere under stirring, and the resulting mixture is further stirred at 40 to 500C for 2 hours to obtain a pale yellow, transparent reaction mixture. This mixture is evaporated to dryness under a reduced pressure at 650C by the use of a rotary evaporator to obtain a white solid residue 93 parts . All analyses such as elemental analysis, ignition test, acetyl group determination or titration with potassium hydroxide ensure that this residue is lithium diacetylphosphate. As described above, the acetylation of lithium phosphate with acetic anhydride according to the prior art proceeds easily to the diacetyl product stage, and gives a homogeneous solution. Lithium monoacetyl phosphate itself, which is selected as a salt suitable for obtaining acetyl phosphate in the form of a solid salt in the present invention, is already well known in the purification and isolation of monoacetyl phosphate from an aqueous solution see E. R.Stadtman and F. Lipmann, J. Biol. Chem., 185, 549 551 Methods in Enzymology, vol. III, pp. 228 231, ed. S. P.Colowick and N. O. Kaplan 1957 D. E. Koshland, Jr.,J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 73, 4103 A. W. D. Avison, J. Chem.Soc,, 1955, 736 . These separation methods are based on the property of dilithium monoacetylphosphate that it is hardly soluble in a mixture of ethanol and water. According to R. W. Porter et al. J. Biol. Chem., 244, 1847 dilithium acetyl phosphate was precipitated by addition of methanol containing lithium acetate to an oily, evaporation residue which was obtained by treating monotriethyl ammonium orthophosphate with acetic anhydride in acetonitrile for one hour at room temperature followed by removing volatile materials using a rotary evaporator. As described above, the medium which has been used in the prior art to precipitate a lithium salt of acetyl phosphate is an alcoholic solvent which is reactive to acetic anhydride. Accordingly, the precipitation of the lithium salt could not be directly combined with the acetylation using acetic anhydride. As described above, there is not known as yet a simple process for precipitating a crystalline salt of monoacetyl phosphate which can be easily handled from the acetylation product of phosphoric acid without recourse to a low temperature operation. Further, the acetylation of phosphate salts proceeds without control to the diacetyl product stage, and otherwise in order to precipitate a lithium salt of monoacetyl phosphate the replacement of the medium of acetylation by another medium was necessary. Summary of the Invention The present invention enables one to overcome these shortcomings of the prior art and provides a new, simplified process for the preparation of a salt of monoacetyl phosphate by combining the acetylation step directly with the separation by precipitation. The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a salt of acetyl phosphate by acetylating a substrate selected from among phosphoric acid and its salts with acetic anhydride, wherein from 1.5 to 2.3 times by mole as much lithium ion as the substrate is present together with the acetylated substrate and a solid salt of monoacetyl phosphate is separated from the reaction mixture. In the present invention, molar ratio refers to not only molecules but also atoms, atomic groups and ions. Detailed Description of the Invention The process of the present invention can be carried out typically according to the following three methods. 1 A process which comprises treating the reaction mixture obtained by acetylating phosphoric acid with acetic anhydride in an inert solvent, with the amount of lithium ion 1.5 to 2.3 molar equivalent to phosphate radical to thereby precipitate acetyl phosphoric acid as a solid lithium salt. 2 A process which comprises reacting a lithium salt of phosphoric acid having a molar ratio of lithium ion to phosphate radical of 1.5 to 2.2 with acetic anhydride in a solid liquid coexistent state and separating a solid lithium salt of monoacetyl phosphate from the reaction mixture. 3 A process which comprises acetylating sodium or potassium phosphate with acetic anhydride in acetic acid, adding zn ionic lithium compound to the resulting reaction solution of the monoacetylation step to thereby precipitate monoacetyl phosphate in the form of its salt containing lithium and separating the precipitate from the reaction medium. Phosphoric acid process The first method, which is one of the representative methods for carrying out the process of the present invention, will be illustrated by the use of acetic acid as an inert solvent. According to this method, orthophosphoric acid is acetylated by the use of a mixture of acetic acid and acetic anhydride and about 2 mol of lithium ion per mol of the orthophosphoric acid is added to the reaction mixture to thereby stop the reaction. Then, the reaction mixture is stirred to precipitate a lithium salt of monoacetyl phosphate, followed by separating the salt from the mother liquor. This method can be carried out in the same manner in an inert solvent other than acetic acid. It has been found that a lithium salt of acetyl phosphate can be precipitated at an ordinary temperature in the form of solid which can be easily separated from the mother liquor containing an inert solvent by restricting the molar ratio of Li to PO4 to about 2 1.5 to 2.3 .On the basis of this finding, the acetylation step has been combined directly with the separation by precipitation, thus simplifying the process. This method needs neither the replacement of a solvent for the acetylation with an alcohol for the precipitation of the lithium salt as different from the prior art, nor a low temperature which has been needed in the ammonium salt precipitation method. According to the present invention, a salt of acetyl phosphate suitable as the substrate of acetate kinase can be easily obtained by the use of easily available starting materials and by operating at appropriately ordinary temperature. The orthophosphoric acid to be used in this method may be hydrous or anhydrous. For example, 100 phosphoric acid prepared by the method described, e.g., in J. Org.Chem., 40, 2518 , 98 phosphoric acid crystalline , 89 phosphoric acid, 85 phosphoric acid or 75 phosphoric acid can be used. The acetylation of orthophosphoric acid is carried out in an inert solvent. The inert solvent must be one in which a mixture of acetic anhydride and phosphoric acid can be dissolved and which does not participate in an irreversible reaction with the mixture. Representative examples of the solvents to be used include acetates such as ethyl acetate, methyl acetate, isopropyl acetate or 2 ethoxyethyl acetate and ethers such as ethyl ether, isopropyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane and methyl tbutyl ether as well as acetic acid described above. The molar ratio of an inert solvent to phosphoric acid at the beginning of the acetylation is preferably 2 to 15, still preferably 3 to 13. The inert solvent is effective not only in decreasing the concentration of phosphoric acid and acetic anhydride in the acetylation to thereby allow the acetylation to proceed moderately, but also in ensuring a good mixing state through both steps of the acetylation and the precipitation. If no inert solvent is used, the condensation of phosphoric acid will accompany as a serious side reaction. If the acetylation is carried out at a low temperature, for example, from 5 to 50C to prevent the side reaction, the solvent less acetylation system will become so viscous that the stirring of the system and the control of the reaction temperature will be difficult. Acetic anhydride not only acts as an acetylating agent and a medium, but also reacts with water contained in the reaction mixture to form acetic acid, thus keeping the reaction system essentially water free. The amount of acetic anhydride to be used is determined by considering the molar ratio of the water to the PO4 group in the starting phosphoric acid. If the value obtained by subtracting the molar ratio of water to PO4 from that of acetic anhydride to PO4 is defined as the effective molar ratio of acetic anhydride, the amount of acetic anhydride to be used is generally determined in such a range as to give the effective molar ratio of at least 1.0.In the present invention, the effective molar ratio of acetic anhydride is preferably from 1.5 to 10, still preferably from 2.0 to 8.0 If necessary, additional acetic anhydride may be added after the addition of ionic lithium compounds. The acetylation temperature must be properly controlled to prevent rapid evolution of the reaction heat and to minimize side reactions such as the condensation of phosphoric acid. Further, the reaction temperature must be determined in such a range as to give a viscosity of the reaction mixture suitable for stirring and mixing. The preferred reaction temprature is varied depending on the kind and the amount of an inert solvent, but is generally 300C or below, at which the side reaction and the heat generation peak are not prominent. When acetic acid is used as an inert solvent, it is generally from 10 to 300C. The reaction time can be determined experimentally with the guidance of the results yield and purity obtained by carrying out the experiment at varied temperatures. When acetic acid is used as an inert solvent, it is generally from 30 minutes to 2 hours, preferably from 30 minutes to one hour. After or during the acetylation, precipitation is carried out by the addition of lithium ion. Preferred examples of the ionic lithium compounds which can provide lithium ion include lithium acetate anhydrous , lithium acetate dihydrate , lithium hydroxide anhydrous , lithium hydroxide monohydrate and lithium carbonate. These compounds may be added in the form of powder or dispersion in acetic anhydride or an inert solvent such as acetic acid. After the addition, the reaction mixture is stirred until a homogeneous slurry is formed. The amount of the ionic lithium compound to be used is determined in such a range as to give a molar ratio of lithium ion to orthophosphoric acid of from 1.5 to 2.3, preferably from 1.8 to 2.3 and most preferably from 1.9 to 2.2. The addition is generally carried out at 300C or below, preferably at 200C or below. A lithium salt of acetyl phosphate is formed as a white crystalline solid and it can be easily isolated from the reaction mixture by a solid liquid separating method such as filtration. The product is washed with an organic solvent such as acetic acid and methanol and dried under a reduced pressure to give a powder. It is confirmed by analyses such as the enzymatic assay seeG. M. Whitesides et al, J. Org. Chem., 40, 2516 9 , or liquid chromatography Referential Example that this powder is a lithium salt of monoacetyl phosphate containing 4.8 to 5.8 mmol g of active phosphoric acid. According to this method, lithium ion is added to the reaction mixture obtained by acetylating phosphoric acid with acetic anhydride in an inert solvent such as acetic acid, with a molar ratio of Li to PO4 of near 2, to thereby obtain a crystalline salt of acetyl phosphate.This salt has a high purity by the enzymatic assay and can be easily handled and separated by the separation step directly combined with the acetylation step. Lithium phosphate process In the second method, a lithium salt of phosphoric acid is used as a raw material. This salt scts as a substrate for acetylation and provides at the same time lithium ion which is needed to precipitate the objective product. Among lithium salts of phosphoric acid, only Li3PO4 is ordinarily available as a reagent, but the lithium salt of phosphoric acid to be used in the present invention need not be commercial products which are isolated and have a definite stoichiometric composition. That is to say, the useful lithium salts also include the mixtures prepared by mixing phosphoric acid with lithium ion sources.The mixtures, for example, are obtainable by adding an ionic lithium compound, namely, lithium acetate anhydrous , lithium acetate dihydrate , lithium hydroxide anhydrous , lithium hydroxide monohydrate , or lithium carbonate, to a homogeneous acetic acid solution of an available form of phosphoric acid, such as 100 phosphoric acid, 98 phosphoric acid crystalline , 89 phosphoric acid, 85 phosphoric acid or 75 phosphoric acid, and stirring the resultant mixture until a homogeneous slurry is formed.Hereinafter, this slurry mixture is treated as lithium salts of phosphoric acid formally represented by the following formula I in a medium such as acetic acid. LimH P mn O4XH2O I wherein m, n and x are each a positive number, and m n 3, m 0, x 0The formula I shows only the composition of the above mixture as the molar ratio based on PO4 radical, and does not always correspond to the actual state of a salt of phosphoric acid in the reaction mixture. x means the total amount of water both contained in starting materials and formed by the neutralization which may occur depending on the combination of the raw materials. This method is characterized by using the raw materials having the specified molar ratio of lithium to phosphate radical. The lithium salts of phosphoric acid to be used are compounds represented by the formula I wherein preferably 2.2 m 1.5, accordingly 1.5 n 0.8 and, with respect to water, 6.0 x 0, still preferably 2.1 m 1.9 l.lin10.9 That is to say, when a salt substantially comprising dilithium phosphate is used, a lithium salt of monoacetyl phosphate ean be obtained in a high yield. If m is outside the above stated range, the yield and the purity of the objective product will drop sharply. In this method, acetic anhydride act as an acetylating agent for the lithium salt of phosphoric acid, and the acetylation is generally carried out in the presence of acetic acid medium, that is to say, in a mixture of acetic acid and acetic anhydride. Acetic anhydride not only act as an acetylating agent and a medium, but also reacts with water contained in the reaction mixture to form acetic acid, thus keeping the reaction system essentially water free. The amount of acetic anhydride to be used is determined by considering the molar ratio of the water to the PO4 group i.e. x in the formula I in the starting phosphoric acid.Here, if the value obtaine4.by substracting x from the molar ratio of acetic anhydride to a salt of phosphoric acid is defined as the effective molar ratio of acetic anhydride, the amount of acetic anhydride to be used is generally determined in such a range as to give the effective molar ratio of at least 1.0. In the present invention, the effective molar ratio of acetic anhydride is perferably from 1.5 to 10, still preferably from 2.0 to 8.0 Acetic acid is used in an amount enough to form a slurry in the preparation of a mixture of a salt of phosphoric acid, that is to say, in an amount enough to allow the reaction system to be stirred smoothly. Generally, the molar ratio of acetic acid to the salt of phosphoric acid at the beginning of the acetylation is preferably from 2 to 15, still preferably from 3 to 13. With respect to the acetylation conditions, the temperature and the reaction time should be considered.The reaction temperature can be selected in the range of 25 to 800C, still preferably 30 to 70QC, while the reaction time can be determined experimentally with the guidance of the results yield and purity obtained by carrying out the experiments at varied temperatures.With respect to the reaction tilde, the so called minimum required time was observed. The results of the reaction did not substantially vary at temperatures within the most preferred range, as long as the reaction was carried out for a time longer than the predetermined time. This result is unexpected from the fact that the acetylation proceeded to the diacetylation stage after a short period of time and therefore salts of monoacetyl phosphate could not be obtained in the prior art described in the aboveWest German Patent. In the prior art using the compound represented by formula I , wherein m is 1 n is 2 as a raw material, the reaction mixture becomes homogeneous. On the contrary, in the present invention, the reaction proceeds in a solid liquid coexistent state from the beginning to the end. As described above, when a salt of phosphoric acid represented by formula I wherein m is near 2 is used, a lithium salt of monoacetyl phosphate can be peculiarly and directly obtained in a solid form, and precipitates from the acetylation liquid. Probably, therefore, undesirable diacetylation is substantially prevented, even if the reaction time was longer. Accordingly, with respect to the reaction time, only the minimum required time must be noted. For example, at 300C, the reaction time of 30 hours is not sufficient and a longer time is required, while the time of 20 hours is sufficient at 350C. In this method, the acetylation is always a heterogeneous reaction and therefore it is necessary to stir the reaction mixture in order to carry out the reaction smoothly.The excess of acetic anhydride and the acetic acid generated by the reaction act as liquid media, but it is preferred to add an inert solvent at the beginning. The kind of the inert solvents is the same as described in phosphoric acid process . A representative example of the inert solvents is acetic acid. The amount of the inert solvent must be enough to carry out smoothly the above heterogeneous reaction under stirring. The white crystalline reaction product can be separated, purified and analyzed according to the same method as described in Phosphoric acid process . This product is identified as lithium salt of monoacetyl phosphate having an active phosphoric acid content of 5.2 to 5.8 mmol g. According to this method, a solid, lithium salt of monoacetyl phosphate can be obtained by a simple solidliquid separating method, by selecting a specified lithium salt of phosphoric acid having a molar ratio of Li to P04 of near 2 as a substance for the acetylation with acetic anhydride. This product has also a high purity as determined by an enzymatic assay. Sodium or potassium phosphate process In this method, the acetylation is carried out in acetic acid in which the phosphate as a raw material can not be completely dissolved. Therefore this method essentially has a possibility that the acetylation may proceed to the diacetyl product forming stage, similarly to the heterogeneous acetylation according to the prior art. However the inventors of the present invention have fully examined the results of the reaction and have found that the progress of the acetylation in acetic acid medium to the diacetylation step is not uncontrollable and it is possible to quench the reaction at substantially the monoacetylation stage The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of this finding. This method relates to a process for the preparation of a salt of acetyl phosphate characterized in that sodium or potassium phosphate is acetyEated with acetic anhydride in acetic acid and an ionic lithium compound is added to the reaction mixture of the monoacetylation stage to thereby precipitate monoacetyl phosphate in the form of a salt containing lithium, followed by separating the salt. The salt of acetyl phosphate obtained according to this method is a composition which has one acetyl group per molecule and contains lithium ions as cation. The number of lithium atoms contained in the salt is not limited to a stoichiometric value such as 1 or 2. Further, the salt may contain sodium or potassium ion which is derived. from the corresponding raw material. The present invention does not aim at obtaining a pure substance, but aims at obtaining a salt of acetyl phosphate which can act as an active raw material in the reaction involving acetate kinase. It was confirmed by the enzymatic assay that the salt of acetyl phosphate obtained according to this process has a desired reactivity. Examples of the sodium orthophosphate to be used in this method include not only commercially available chemicals having a stoichiometric composition, such as NaH2PO4, NaH2po4.H2o, NaH2PO4. 2H2O, Na2HpO41 Na2HpO4. 2H2O, Na2HPO4.7H2O, Na2HPO4. 12H2O, Na3PO4 or Na3PO4.12H2O, but also anhydrous or hydrous sodium phosphates obtained by adding sodium acetate anhydrous , sodium acetate trihydrate , sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate anhydrous , sodium carbonate monohydrate , sodium carbonate decahydrate , sodium bicarbonate or the above commercially available sodium orthophosphates to a homogeneous solution of an available orthophosphoric acid, such as 100 phosphoric acid, 98 phosphoric acid crystalline , 89 phosphoric acid, 85 phosphoric acid or 75 phosphoric acid, in acetic acid. Examples of the potassium orthophosphate to be used in this method include not only available chemicals having a stoichiometric composition, such as KH2PO4, K HPO K2HPO4.3H2O, K3PO4 or K3PO4.7H20, but also anhydrous or hydrous potassium orthophosphates obtained by adding potassium acetate, potassium hydroxide, potassium carbonate anhydrous , potassium carbonate sesquihydrate , potassium bicarbonate or the above available potassium orthophosphates to a homogeneous solution of the above available orthophosphate in acetic acid. Similarly to the case of a lithium salt of phosphoric acid, hereinafter formula II will be used to describe the compósition of the sodium or potassium salt. Na, K mHnPO4.XH2O II wherein m, n, x and the meaning of the formula are the same as in formula I . The sodium or potassium orthophosphates to be used in this method are those represented by formula II , wherein preferably 3.0 2 m 2 0.5 2.5 2 n 0, varied 5.0 2 x 2 O, still preferably 3.0 2 m 2 0.8, 2.2 n 0, and 3.0 2 x 2 0. The reactivities of the sodium and potassium salts as a starting material to acetic anhydride contained in acetic acid are parallel each other, as far as other conditions are the same. Of course, salts containing both sodium and potassium can be used. In this method, acetic anhydride serves as an acetylating agent and the acetylation is carried out in the presence of an inert solvent such as acetic acid. The amount of acetic anhydride to be used is determined mainly depending on the amount of water contained in the orthophosphate as a raw material and the kind of an ionic lithium compound to be used as a precipitating agent.Acetic anhydride also reacts with water contained in the reaction mixture to thereby form acetic acid, thus keeping the reaction mixture essentially water free. Accordingly, when a lithium compound which contains the water of crystallization or generates water by the neutralization with acetylphosphoric acid, such as lithium hydroxide anhydrous , lithium hydroxide monohydrate or lithium carbonate, is used as the ionic lithium compound, it is preferred that acetic anhydride is present in a amount enough to consume the water, thus protecting the objective product from the undesired hydrolysis. Accordingly, additional acetic anhydride may be added before the precipitation step see, for example, Example 27 . The molar ratio of acetic anhydride to orthophosphate in the acetylation is generally from 3 to 15, still preferably from 4 to 8, while the molar ratio of acetic acid to orthophosphate at the beginning of the acetylation is generally from 2 to 15, still preferably from 3 to 10. Sodium or potassium orthophosphate is used as a raw material in this method and the product is lithium salt of acetyl phosphate.Therefore, the reaction mixture contains sodium or potassium acetate. If the acetate is present in an amount exceeding its solutiblity in the precipitation step, the acetate will separate out, thus making the separation difficult. The above acetate can be dissolved in acetic acid at an ordinary temperature and therefore, if necessary, acetic acid may be added in the precipitation step see, for example,Example 29 . With respect to the acetylation conditions, the temperature and especially the reaction time are critical in order to arrest the reaction at the monoacetylation stage. The reaction temperature can be selected in the range of 20 to 800C, but the reaction time must be controlled strictly. Especially, if the reaction time was longer than the optimum one, a significant decrease in the yield of the product is observed see Comparative Example .This decrease occurs because the orthophosphate is diacetylated and the resulting diacetylate does not precipitate by the addition of a lithium salt. The optimum reaction time can be easily determined by observing the progress of the reaction actually. The acetylation in this method belongs to a heterogeneous reaction, and the orthophosphate is monoacetylated in the presence of acetic acid with the gradual change of the reaction mixture into a homogeneous solution. The optimum reaction time can be determined by measuring the turbidity of the reaction mixture or by observing the residual amount of solid in the reaction mixture. The reaction time is generally varied over the range of from 5 minutes to 3 hours, depending on the reaction temperatures.Actually, when the reaction mixture becomes substantially solid free, it is ideal for the reaction temperature to be about 300C, still preferably about 20 C. When unreacted orthophosphate remains, it is recommended to carry out the precipitation after the filtration. It is effective in the smooth accomplishment of the reaction to pulverize the phosphate as a raw material and stir the reaction mixture, thus increasing the rate of dissolution, because the acetylation is a heterogeneous reaction. Immediately after the solution of the monoacetylation stage has been obtained according to the above procedure, an ionic lithium compound is added to the solution to thereby precipitate monoacetyl phosphate in the form of its salt including lithium salt, followed by separation. This precipitation step is generally carried out at about 300C, still preferably while keeping the mixture at about 200C by cooling. This step prevents the acetylation from proceeding to the diacetylation stage and thereby the objective product can be separated from the medium containing acetic acid.The preferred ionic lithium compound to be added immediately after the turbidity due to the phosphate which is present at the beginning of the acetylation has essentially disappeared is a lithium compound selected from among lithium acetate, lithium hydroxide anhydrous , lithium hydroxide monohydrate and lithium carbonate Lithium compounds containing an anion which is liable to cause a side reaction, such as lithium chloride, must be avoided. The ionic lithium compound may be added in the form of powder or dispersion in a medium such as acetic acid. After the addition, the reaction mixture is further stirred until a homogeneous slurry results. In this step, lithium hydroxide anhydrous , lithium hydroxide monohydrate or lithium carbonate may be pretreated with acetic anhydride or a mixture of acetic acid and acetic anhydride to form anhydrous lithium acetate, followed by using the anhydrous salt in the precipitation step. The molar ratio of lithium ion to orthophosphate as a raw material is preferably from 1.5 to 2.5, still preferably from 1.7 to 2.2. The white crystalline solid obtained in the precipitation step can be easily separated from the reaction mixture by separation means such as filtration and the separated solid is washed with an organic solvent such as acetic acid or methanol and dried under a reduced pressure similarly to the case in Lithium phosphate process . It is confirmed by the enzymatic assay that the content of active phosphoric acid of this product is about 5 to 6 mmol g. According to this method, the monoacetylation stage can be arrested in the heterogeneous acetylation of a phosphate salt with acetic anhydride in acetic acid, by means of adding an ionic lithium compound thereby quenching the reaction and enabling facile separation of the monoacetyl phosphate salt.
