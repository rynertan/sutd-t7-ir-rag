# DC DC converter.

## Abstract
A switched mode power supply in which the power switch TR1 is modulated by a resistance capacitance oscillator COM, R1 R5, CT . During each on period of the switch TR1 a secondary winding WS of a sense transfor mer TX2 develops a unipolar sense voltage which is applied to a capacitor CT in the oscillator while it is charging so as to vary the charging time and hence the on period, the off period of the switch TR1 being constant.
