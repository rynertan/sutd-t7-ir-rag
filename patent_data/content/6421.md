## Description
Method for Drying Polyolefins and Apparatus ThereforThe present invention relates to a method for drying polyolefins and an apparatus suitable therefor. ore particularly, it relates to an improved method of drying polyolefins which is characteristic in that it satisfactorily reduces a concentration of one or more of hydrocarbons having 1 to 8 carbon atoms and alcohols having 1 to 8 carbon atoms which remain in the polyolefins dried by conventional drying methods, and to an apparatus suitable for the method. When polyolefins are produced in a hydrocarbon .medium in the presence of a catalyst containing as one of the components a compound of a transition metal, suc as Ziegler catalyst, they subjcctincj two to post treatnents such as deashing, subsequently treating the resulting slurry of the polyolefins in a hydrocarbon with a centrifugal separator to separate the slurry into a hydrocarbon phase containing a acetat polymers and a polyolefin cake containing a small amount of the hydrocarbon medium,and then drying the cake.The polyolefin cake containing a hydrocarbon medium has usually been dried in two steps In the first step,. it is dried with a heated nitrogen gas which contains hydrocarbons having 1 to 8 carbon atoms and or alcohols having I to 8 carbon atoms and has a dew point of 500C, using a drier such as a flush dryer, fluid bed dryer or rotary dryer until the concentration of the hydrocarbons having 1 to 8 carbon atoms and or the alcohols having 1 to 8 carbon atoms reaches 1 to 2 by weight, and in the second step,.it is dried using the same dryer as in the first step until the concentration of the hydrocarbons and or alcohols reaches 100 to 2,000 ppm by weight.However, according to the known drying method the polyolefin powder still contains about 100 to 2,000 ppm by weight of hydrocarbons having 1 to 8 carbon atoms and or alcohols having 1 to 8 carbon atoms owing to the hydrocarbon medium and other agents which are used in the polyra2riza tion step and the subsequent treatments, and it is difficult to satisfactorily remove the remaining hydrocarbons and alcohols. Moreover, even to reduce the hydrocarbons to such a level, the nitrogen gas should have a dew point of less than 10 C in the light of the vapor solid adsorption equilibrium of the hydrocarbons and or alcohols in the polyolefin phase and the nitrogen gas phase.Besides, since a large amount of nitrogen gas should be used, it is necessary to re use the gas repeatedly by circulating it in the system to save costs and, therefore, the nitrogen gas should be kept at the desired dew point by cooling and heating alternately with a freezer and a heater respectively, which results in a substantial loss of heat. The hydrocarbons and or alcohols rema.ininc in the polyolefin poweder are not reduced in the subsequent pelletizing step, and te pellets thus obtained still contain almost the same amount of hydrocarbons and or alcohols, so that when the polyolefin powders containing hydrocarbons and or alcohols are used for processing, the final products are inferior in printability, odour,coloring so called scorching , and the like.In order to eliminate these drawbacks in the final products, it is desired to remove the remaining hydrocarbons and or alcohols from the polyolefin powder. For this purpose it has been proposed, as the third step or in place of the second step in the above known drying method, to subject the polyolefin powders to drying with nitrogen gas with forcible agitation by means of a rotatory agitating blade in an agitating drying apparatus usually called a paddle dryer , cf. Chemical Apparatus, 1978,December, pages 29 37 . However, according to this method it is essential to diffuse the powder well in order to promote the drying effect, so that a great amount of power is required for the forcible agitation of the polyolefin powders, and this is disadvantageous from the standpoint of minimizing energy outlay.As a result of the present inventors intensive studies on an improved method of drying polyolefin powders without using a great amount of energy as does the knows drying method, it has been found that the polyolefins can be dried efficiently by bringing the polyolefin powders into contact with an inert gas which contains virtually neither hydrocarbon having 1 to 8 carbon atoms nor alcohol having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, in countrflow in a silo tyf through flow drying apparatus. An object of the present invention is to provide an improved method of drying polyolefins. Another object of the invention iscto provide a method for reducing satisfactorily a concentration of hydrocarbons having 1 to 8 carbon atoms and or alcohols having 1 to 8 carbon atoms which remain in an amount of 100 ppm to 2 by weight in the polyolefins dried by conventional drying methods. A further object of the invention is to provide an apparatus suitable for performing the drying as set out above. These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following description.According to the present invention, the polyolefins to be treated are brought into contact in counterf low with an inert gas which virtually contains no hydrocarbon having 1 to 8 carbon atoms and or no alcohol having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, preferably keeping the temperature of the polyolefins at 50 to 1300C, under the condition that thetotal concentration of hydrocarbon and or alcohols, in the gaseous phase Cg ppm by volume satisfies the following formula I EMI4.1 wherein Cs is the total concentration of the hydrocarbons having 1 to 8 carbon atoms and or alcohols having 1 to 8 carbon atoms which are contained in the polyolefins and are to be removed ppm by weight , T is an absolute temperature OK , g is base of natural logarithm, and R is a gas constant 1.987 Cal deg.mol . Contact may usually last from about 0.5 to 20 hours.Although it has been considered essential to promote the diffusion of the components to be removed by agitation or fluidization of the powders in order to dry the polyolefins, it has now surprisingly been found that a through flow drying apparatus using a silo can be used effectively, whereby the polyolefins can satisfacto rily be dried. Thesmetfiod of the present invention has the aduptaF that the heat added to the polyolefins in the previous step can be used efficiently and, furthermore, the remaining heat can be used as a preheating energy source in the processing step, resulting in a significant energy saving.The silo type through flow drying apparatus used in the present invention is a silo type through flow drying storage vessel. The storage vessel may be a single tank or may consist of two or more tanks connected in series.When the storage vessel consists of two or more tanks, each tank maybe separate, but preferably, all tanks are accommodated in a single storage vessel, i.e. two or more tanks having the same or similar shape and dimensions are accommodated in a single storage vessel hereinafter, such a vessel containing a plurality of tanks is referred to as multi silo type through flow drying apparatus . The silo type through flow drying apparatus used in the pre sent invention has the following shape and dimensions.Its appearance is the same as that of the conventional silo type storage vessel, i.e. a cylindrical storage vessel having a conical substructure, but it is not limited thereto. The vessel has a ratio of 1.0 or more of height to inner diameter when the main part of the vessel is not cylindrical the inner diameter is calculated by converting the sectional area to a circular area .The apparatus is provided with a device for introducing polyolefins usually a cyclone at its upper part, together with a device for introducing an inert gas at the bottom or side wall, and is further optionally provided with external means of insulation or means of prehoat ing the inert gas. Such an apparatus rily be constructed specially for the tank, or else conventional storage vessels usually used for storage of polyolefin powders may be used after modifying them to meet the shape and dirnsis desired.The media remaining in the polyolefins are hydrocarbons having 1 to 8 carbon atoms and or alcohols having 1 to 8 carbon atoms. The hydrocarbons include saturated or unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbons having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, e.g. methane, ethane, ethene, propane, propene, n butane, 1 butene, n pentane, 1 pentene n hexane methylpentanes, 4 methyl 1 pentene, dimethylbutanes and methylhexanes alicyclic hydrocarbons having 5 to 8 carbon atoms, e.g. cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, cyclo heptane and aromatic hydrocarbons having 6 to 8 carbon atoms, such as benzene, toluene and xylene. The alcohols include aliphatic alcohols having 1 to 8 carbcnatoms, e.g. methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, n propyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, n butyl alcohol, isobutyl alcohol, n amyl alcohol, hexyl alcohol, heptyl alcohol, n 6ctyl alcohol and 2 ethylhexyl alcohol.The polyolefins charged in the apparatus are at a temperature of 50 to 1300C, preferably 60 to 1250C. When the temperature is lower than 500C the desired drying effect is not achieved and, on the other hand, when the temperature is over 1300C undesirable fusing of the polyolefins appears.The inert gas to be introduced into the apparatus can be nitrogen gas, argon gas, etc., but preferably nitrogen gas. The nitrogen gas contains virtually neither hydrocarbon having 1 to 8 carbon atoms nor alcohol having 1 to 8 carbon atoms. Preferred nitrogen gas has a dew point of lower than 20 C. Industrial nitrogen gas usually satisfies these requirements. The inert gas is usually used at a temperature of 20 to 1300C, the amount used varying with the initial concentration of media remaining in the polyolefins and also with the desired final concentration thereof, but the inert gas is usually used in an amount of 20 Nm3 or more,preferably 20 to 1.50Nm , , per ton of polyolefins to be treated.The polyolefin powders to be treated are retained in the silo type through flow drying apparatus for an average of 0.5 to 20 hours. Preferred retention time is in the range of 1 to 10 hours on average.The polyolefins to be treated include homopolymers and or copolymers of olefins such as ethylene, propylene, 1 butene, 3 methyl 1 butene, 4 methyl i pentene arid 1 octene.Examples of the polyolefins are polyethylene, polypropylene, polybutene, poly 4 methyl 1 pentene ethylene propylene copolymer, ethylene 1 butene copolymer, propylene 1 butene copolymer and similar. The polyolefins can be subjected to drying in any form,for instance pow ders or pellets, but are usually used in the form of powder.The drying of the polyol.efins using the silo type through flow drying apparatus is carried out by bringing the polyolefins into contact with an inert gas in counterflow and, in case of the multi silo type through flow drying apparatus, this is achieved by means of multiple counterflow contact in a vessel wherein a plurality of tanks is arranged and connected in series. The contact may be carried out in such a way that a fixed amount of polyolefins is charged into the apparatus beforehand and the polyolefins are subjected to contact with the inert gas under the above mentioned conditions for a fixed period of time, as thereafter the polyolefins are taken out from the apparatus simultaneously batch system , or else in such a way that th e polyolefins are continuously charcjed into the apparatus from tile upper part t thereof and are continuously taken out from the lower part, all the while the polyolefins being continuously brought into 4 contact with the inert gas under the above mentioned conditions continuous system , or else the batch system and the continuous system are combined and are run altern ately. The method and apparatus of the present invention are illustrated in more detail in the accompanying drawings Figure 1 shows one embodiment of the drying system of the present invention which comprises a silo type through flow drying apparatus and the first drying machine, and Figure 2 shows a multi silo type through flow drying appa ratus In Figure 1 a cake of polyolefins, from which most of the hydrocarbons having 1 to 8 carbon atoms and or alcohols having 1 to 8 carbon atoms have previously been removed by a centrifuging separator,is supplied to the first dry ing machine 2 e.g. a box type fluid bed dryer, flush dryer, or rotary dryer through a line 1.Into the first drying machine 2 is supplied nitrogen gas which is com pressed in a blower 9 and heated with a heater 10, and in the first drying machine 2 the polyolefins are dried.until the concentration of the hydrocarbons and or alcohol becomes lower than 2 by weight. The nitrogen gas which contains the hydrocarbons and or alcohols is sent to a cooling tower 4 through a line 3. In the cooling tower 4, liquid hydrocarbons are circulated through a line 5 by means of a pump 6 and are cooled with a cooler 7, whereby the nitrogen gas is cooled until the temperature of the nitrogen gas at the outlet of the cooling tower 4 reaches a prescribed temperature e.g. 40 to 700C .By means of this treatment in the cooling tower 4, the hydrocarbons and or alcohols evaporated into the nitrogen gas are recovered and sent through a line 8 to a section for treating the recovered solvent not shown in the figure . The polyolefins taken out from the first drying machine 2 are sent to the upper part of a silo type through flow drying apparatus 13,the outer wall of which is convered with a heat insulating material, through a line 11 and a cyclone 12 hy means of blower 17. The polyolefins fall tanks to the gravity in the drying apparatus 13 while in contact with nitrogen gas in counterflow and are taken out from the lower part of the apparatus 13 via a valve 16.An industrial nitrogen gas, containing substantially m o hydrocarbon having 1 to 8 carbon atoms and or no alcohol having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, is fed into the silo type through flow d,ryingapparatus 13 from the lower part thereof via a line 14 and rises in the apparatus whil in contact with the polyolefins in counterflow, is taken out from the upper part thereof and sent to the cooling tower 4 through a line 15.Instead of a single tank as shown in Figure 1, a multi silo type through flow drying apparatus wherein two Ci more tanks are arranged and connected in series may preferably be used, as shown in Figure 2.In other words, as shown in Figure 2,a cake of polyolefins pretreated as in Figure 1 is fed into a first drying achine 22 through a line 21 and is treated in the same lay.The polyolefins taken out from the first drying mache 22 are fed into an outside tank 27 of a double structural, silo type through flow drying apparatus 26 through a line 24 and a cyclone 25 by means of a blower 23. The outer wall of the drying apparatus 26 is covered with a he insulating material 28.The polyolefins passed fror l the upper part of the outer tank 27 descend owing to the gravity therein while in contact with nitrogen gas iL counterflow, and are taken out from the lower part through a rotary valve 30, and then the polyolefins are fed Lnto the inner tank 29 of the double structural, silo t through flow drying apparatus 26 through a line 31 and a cyc lone Bo2 by means of a blower 33. The polyolefins passed from the upper part of the inner tank 29 descend owing to gravity while in contact with nitrogen gas in counterf low and are taken out from the lower part through a valve 34 and a line 35. An industrial nitrogen gas, containing virtually no hydrocarbon having 1 to 8 carbon atoms and orno.aldohol having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, is fed into the inner tank 29 from the lower part thereof through a line 36, rises therein while in contact with the polyolefins in counterflow, and is taken out from the upper part.Part of the nitrogen gas is circulated through lines 31 31 by means of the blower 33, and the remaining nitrogen gas is fed into the outer tank 27 from the lower part thereof through a line 37 and rises therein while in contact with the polyolefins in counterflow, and is taken out from the upper part. Part of the nitrogen gas taken out from the upper part of the outer tank 27 is circulated through lines 24 24 by means of a blower 23 and the remaining nitrogen gas is passed to a device for treating the nitrogen gas not shown in the figure through a line 38.The present invention is characterized as follows 1 Firstly, the drying method of the present invention produces a saving in energy in comparison with conventional methods and can, moreover, achieve a high degree of drying which could not be achieved by the conventional drying methods. In other words, according to the conventional two step drying technique a large amount of an inert gas is required as a drying medium in the fluid bed dryer used in the second step, and hence it is essential to re use the drying medium from the standpoint of minimizing cost. In order to re use the drying medium the dew point of the hydrocarbons and or alcohols in the inert gas must be sufficiently lowered and thereafter the gas must be heated again, thus entailing great energy consumption by the repeated cooling and re heating. Moreover, it is impossible to keep the dew point below the ew point 40 C of the industrial nitrogen gas in the process of polyolefin production, with the result that it is impossible to dry sufficiently until the total concentration of the hydrocarbons and or alcohols in the polyolefins reaches a satisfactorily low level. Besides, where an agitating drying apparatus is used instead of the second step or as the third step, forcible agitation of the polyolefins is required, and this entails great energy outlay.In contrast to these conventional methods, the method of the present invention does not require this forcible diffusion of the polyolefins and, what is more, only a small amount of an inert gas needs to be used as the drying medium and it is not necessary to re cycle this gas.Thus, use of the silo type through flow drying apparatus as the second drying machine results in a considerable saving in energy in the present invention. 2 When the silo type through flow drying apparatus is used in the third step following the conventional two step drying method, or when a multi silo type through flow drying apparatus is used as the drying machine in the later step, the total concentration of hydrocarbons and or alcohols in the polyolefins can satisfactorily be reduced to a far lower level. 3 When a silo type through flow drying apparatus provided with a heat insulating device is used, the temperature of the polyolefins can be better regulated than when a conventional silo is used, resulting in a partial saving in the energy required in the step of pelletizing the polyolefins. When a multi silo type through flow drying apparatus is used, the polyolefins are dried by bringing them into contact with an inert gas in counterflow in multiple tanks connected in series with the result that the amount of inert gas required per unit amount of polyolefins to be dried can be decreased. 5 In the case of the multi silo type through flow drying apparatus, the heat insulating material is provided only on the outermost wall, resulting also in a saving in costs for heat insulation with, furthermore, excellent heat insulating effect and also drying effect. 6 In the case of the multi silo type through flow drying apparatus, the ratio of the height of tank to the sectional area can be increased in comparison with a single tank type apparatus, so that the polyolefins can be uniformly dried without undesirable biassed flow of the inert gas within the tanks.The present invention is illustrated by the following examples but is not limited thereto.In the examples the following polyolefins, apparatuses and inert gas are used.
