# Justifying with printer level data stream which accommodates footers and headers.

## Abstract
In order to avoid the problem of the last line of the body text not being justified when it is not the end of a paragraph but is followed by a footer, a converter processor 13 is provided to modify the print data stream produced by anoth er converter processor 12 from the revisable or editable text data stream. If during conversion from the revisable data stream to the print data stream a last body text line is found and it is not the end of a paragraph, a latch 34 is set. Then, with each line of print data stream text, the latch is checked, and if the latch is set and the text line ends with a carriage return, the carriage return is replaced with a zero index carriage return and an index. These act similar to a carriage return in all cases except one the text line which they terminate may now be justified.
