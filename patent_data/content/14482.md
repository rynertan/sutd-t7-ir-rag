# Preparation of diphenylmethane dicarbamates and polymethylene polyphenyl carbamates with Lewis acid catalysts intercalated in graphite.

## Abstract
Diphenylmethane dicarbamates and polymethylene polyphenyl carbamate homologs and derivatives of these compounds are produced by the condensation of N aryl carbamic acid esters, such as ethylphenylcarbamate, with a carbonyl compound selected from formaldehyde, para for maldehyde or trioxane at a temperature of between about ambient and 170 C. in the presence of a Lewis acid intercalated in graphite and optionally in the presence of an inert solvent.
