# CONDUCTIVE THERMOPLASTIC RESIN FOAM AND PROCESS FOR ITS PRODUCTION.

## Abstract
A conductive foam is obtained by blending 5 to 40 parts by weight of conductive carbon with 100 parts by weight of a resin component composed of 10 to 90 parts by weight of thermoplastic crystalline polyolefln resin and 10 to 90 parts by weight of low crystallinity thermoplastic resin, crosslink ing the resulting blend, and heating it to effect foaming. This foam has a good surface condition and is capable of deep drawing. It can be utilized as a material for semiconductor integrated circuit containers.
