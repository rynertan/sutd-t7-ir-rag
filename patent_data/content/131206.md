# Process for recovering cesium from cesium alum.

## Abstract
Cesium is recovered from cesium alum, CsAl SO₄ ₂, by an aqueous conversion and precipitation reaction using a critical stoichiometric excess of a water soluble permanganate to form solid cesium permanganate CsMnO₄ free from cesium alum. The other metal salts remain in solution, providing the final pH does not cause hydroxides of aluminum or iron to form. The precipitate is separated from the residual solution to obtain CsMnO₄ of high purity.
