## Description
DESCRIPTION PROCESS FOR PRODUCING E THYTThENEi IACETATE This invention relates to a process for producing ethylidenediacetate which comprises reacting carbon monoxide with at least one compound or mixture of two compounds selected from 1 dimethyl acetal, 2 acetaldehyde and methyl acetate, and 3 acetaldehyde and dimethyl ether. In the prior art, ethylidenediacetate was synthesized from acetylene and acetic acid or by. reacting acetaldehyde with acetic anhydride. Recently, a process for producing ethylidenediacetate by reacting methyl acetate or dimethyl ether with carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst was proposed refer to Japanese Patent Publication laid open No. 115409 1976 . In the process disclosed in this PatentPublication, ethylidenediacetate was synthesized from methyl ace tate or dimethyl ether in the presence of a catalyst comprising rhodium or palladium as a main component and a halide as a secondary component. The disclosed process utilizes synthesis gas H2 CO , so the. process is economical in respect of a raw material. However, in the process of the patent publication since a carbonylation reaction by carbon monoxide and a reduction reaction by hydrogen occur at the same time, by products, such as ethyl acetate and propionic acid are likely to be formed.Judging from the stoichimetric equation, acetic acid is formed as a secondary product. Therefore,the yield of ethylidenediacetate is unsatisfactory in the process of the patent publication. The present inventors carried out research to find a process for synthesizing ethylidenediacetate in a high yield. As a result, we found that ethylidenediacetate can be synthe sized by rea.cting carbon monoxide with at least one compound or mixture of two compounds selected from the group consisting of 1 dimethyl acetal, 2 acetaldehyde and methyl acetate, and 3 acetaldehyde and dimethyl ether in the presence of a spec ific catalyst. An object of this invention is to provide a process for synthesizing ethylidenediacetate with little or no by products. This invention relates to a process for producing ethylidenediacetate which comprises reacting carbon monoxide with at least one compound or mixture of two compounds selected from the group consisting of 1 dimethyl acetal, 2 acetalde hyde and methyl acetate, or 3 acetaldehyde and dimethyl ether in the presence of a catalyst comprising .a as a main component at least one material selected from metals belonging to Group VIII of the Periodic Table, compo mds of the metals or mixtures thereof and b as a secondary component at least one material selected from iodides, bromides or mi tures thereof under sub stantially anhydrous conditions. The mechanism of the carbonylation reaction of this invention is not perfectly clear. However, it is believed that the reaction is expressed by the following equation 1 Reaction of dimethyl acetal and carbon monoxideEMI2.1 2 Reaction of acetaldehyde , methyl acetate and carbon monoxide EMI2.2 3 . Reaction of acetaldehyde, dimethyl ether and carbon monoxideEMI2.3 In the case o practicing this invention, ethylidenedi ce tate may be synthesized by one of the three equations. For example, ethylidenediacetate can be synthesized from 1 dimethyl acetal and carbon monoxide, 2 acetaldehyde, methyl acetate and carbon monoxide or 3 acetaldehyde, dimethyl ether and carbon monoxide.Alternatively, ethylidenediacetate may simul taneously be synthesized by two or three equations as mentioned above. For example ethylidenediacetate can be synthesized from a acetaldehyde, methyl acetate, dimethyl ether and carbon monoxide by equations 2 and 3 b dimethyl acetal, acetaldehyde, methyl acetate or dimethyl ether and carbon monoxide by equations 1 and 2 , or 1 and 3 and c dimethyl acetal, acetaldehyde, methyl acetate, dimethyl ether and carbon monoxide by equations 1 , 2 and 3 .

The amount of the organic or inorganic promoter employed depends on the amount of main catalyst employed. In general, the amount of the organic or inorganic promoter employed may be in the range of from 10 6 to l0 mol, preferably 10 4 to 5 mol per liter of total amount of starting material s and solvent. In practicing this invention, the reaction temperature is not critical. In general, the reaction temperature may be in the range 6f 200C 500 C, preferably 30 3500C, more preferably 40 2500C. The reaction pressure is kept high enough to keep the the ram material s , the solvent and the product in a liquid phase and to maintain appropriately partial pressure of each of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The partial pressure cf each of carbon monoxide and hydrogen may be in the range of 0.5 350 atm, preferably 1 300 atm, anymore preferably 3 250 atm. However, partial pressure of each of carbon monoxide and hydrogen may be in the range of 0.05 1000 atm. Carbon monoxide used as a starting material need not necessarily have high purity. The carbon monoxide may contain hydrogen, carbon dioxide, ethane, nitrogen and rare gases.Hydrogen contained in the carbon monoxide tends to make the catalyst stable and assists to proceed to reaction effectively.However, carbon monoxide of extremely low purity is not preferred, because it increases the pressure of reaction system. Dimethyl acetal, acetaldehyde, methyl acetate and dimethyl ether can be produced by processes which do not use petrochemicals such as methylene, etc. as a starting material for they can be synthesized from methanol and synthesis gas H2 CO k efer to Patent Publication for opposition No.2525 1973, Patent Publication laid open NO. 149213 1976,Patent Publication laid open No. 136110 1977 and PatentPublication laid open No.136111 1977 . The starting materials produced by the above processes may contain inpurities such as methanol, acetic acid etc. formed as by products, and such impurities can be tolerated. In case of synthesizing ethylidenediacetate from acetaldehyde, methyl acetate or dimethyl ether and carbon monoxide, the molar ratio of acetaldehyde to methyl acetate or dimethyl ether may vary over a wide range. But, in order tQ increase conversion ratio of acetaldehyde, methyl acetate or dimethyl ether is used in excess of the stoichimetric ratio. The product, ethylidenediacetate, produced according to this invention is likely to decompose in the presence of water. After the raw material and the solvent have been dried to a substantially anhydrous state, they should be introduced into the reaction system. The reaction system should be kept in a substantially anllydrous state. In other words, water content in the reaction system should be kept to less than 10 mol on the basis of total mol of the liquid components present in the reaction system, preferably less than 5 mol and more preferably less than 3 mol t. When methyl acetate or dimethyl ether either is used as a starting material, it serves as a solvent for reaction. So another solvent is not necessary. However, when dimethyl acetal is used as a starting material or even when methyl acetate or dimethyl ether is used as a starting material, an organic solvent and a diluent compatible with the raw materials and the product under the reaction conditions may be used.Examples of the organic solvent include organic acids, such as acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, octanoic acid, phthalic acid, benzoic acid esters of organic acids, such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, ethylene glycol diacetate, propylene glycol diacetate, dimethyl adipate, methyl benzoate, ethyl benzoate, dimethyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate, phenyl acetate, and tolyl acetate hydrocarbons, such as dodecane, hexadecane, benzene, naphthalene, and biphenyl esters of inorganic acids, such as triphenyl phosphate, tricresyl phosphate, dibutylphenyl phosphate, silicates such as tetramethyl ortho silicate, and tetrabutyl silicate aromatic ethers, such as diphenyl ethers ketones, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, dibutyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, acetophenone, and benzophenone. When dimethyl acetal or dimethyl ether is used as a starting material, acetic acid or its derivative, for example, methyl acetate, other carboxylic esters, carboxylic anhydride, such acetic anhydride, or mixtures thereof may be used as a solvent. When methyl acetate is used as a starting material, methyl acetate itself, acetic acid which is a derivative of methyl acetate or mixture thereof may be used as a solvent.These solvents make the reaction system and the catalyst system stable and increase selectivity and yield of the product. The present process may be carried out by batch, semicontinuous or continuous method. When the semi continuous and continuous methods are used, the concentration of acetaldehyde or dimethyl acetal can be kept at such a lower level that little or no polymerization of acetaldehyde or dimethyl acetal occurs, so these method are preferable. The continuous method is more preferable from an industrial view point. This invention is further illustrated by non limitingExamples.
