## Description
NOVEL ALLYLIC AMINES Tbis invention relates to novel allylic amines, the processes and intermediates useful for their preparation, and to the pharmaceutical compositions and the method of treating hypertension with such compositions. More specifically, this invention relates to allylic amines of the formulaEMI1.1 and the non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof. Still more specifically, the compounds of this invention relate to 8 methylene 2 furanethanamine and X methylene 3 furanethanamine and the non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof. Representative salts are those salts formed with nontoxic organic or inorganic acids, such as, for example those formed from the following acids hydrochloric, hydrobroaic, sutioD duifurict phosphoric, nitric, maleic, fumaric, benzoic,ascorbic, succinic, methanesulfonic, acetic, propionic, tartaric, citric, lactic, malic, mandelic, cinnamic, palmitic, itaconic, and benzenesulfonic. The allylic amines I of this invention can readily be prepared by a series of reactions illustrated by the following reaction scheme EMI2.1 In essence, the foregoing reaction scheme depicts the conversion of 2 or 3 ace5tyl derivatives of furan to the corresponding 2 or 3 lsopropylidene derivatives by reactions with methylmagnesium bromide with subsequent dehydration according to standard Grignard reaction conditions. The isopropylidene derivatives IV are subjected to allylic chlorination according to standard conditions and the crude products V are converted via phthalimide derivatives VI by the well known Gabriel synthesis to obtain the desired allylic amines of formula I.The free bases can be converted to the acid addition salts, or the acid addition salts can be converted to the free bases, by conventional chemical methodology. The foregoing re n a me is further illustrated by the following specific exemplifications. EXAMPLE I 8 Methylsne 2 Furanethanamine Hydrochloride Step A 2 l Methvl ethenvlfuran.. A solution of 55.06 g 0.5 mole of 2 acetylfuran in 100 ml of anhydrous ether was added dropwise under N2 during 1.5 hour to 211 ml of 2.85 M methylmagnesium bromide ether 0.6 mole while the reaction mixture was stirred in an ice bath. The temperature was kept below 300C by controlling the rate of addition. A grey precipitate formed. The mixture was allowed to warm to 25 C for 1 hour, then was cooled again in an ice bath while 100 ml of saturated NaHCO3 solution was added carefully. The resulting mass was dissolved in about 1 liter of water and the aqueous phase was extracted twice with ether. The combined ether solutions were extracted with saturated NaCl solution, dried over R2C03, filtered, and concentrated at atmospheric pressure to a yellow oil. To this crude alcohol was added 5.0 g of KHS04 and about 0.1 g of 4 tert butyl catechol inhibitor and the mixture was distilled at 1 atm. A mixture of the desired product and water distilled over at about 900C. The water was separated and the product was dried over K2CO3, then filtered to afford 8.5 g of colorless oil. Similarly prepared is 3 l methyl ethenylfuran. Step B N 2 2 Furanyl propenylhthalimide To a solution of 8.35 g 0.077 mole of the olefin of Step A in 310 ml of DMF was added 12.37 g 0.093 mole of N chlorosuccinimide and 1.46 g 0.0047 mole of diphenyl diselenide. After 3 hours at room temperature the mixture was partitioned between. 500 ml of tse uhe and 1000 ml of 5 Sa2S203. The hexane was distilled off at atmospheric pressure and the residue was dissolved in 200 ml of DMF, 9.49 g 0.051 mole of potassium phthalimide was added and the mixture was warmed to 900C under N2. After 45 min.the cooled reaction mixture was poured into water and the precipitated product was filtered off and recrystallized from ethylacetate 2 propanol, affording 3.57 g colorless crystals, mp. 136 1370C. Anal. Calc d for C15HllN02S C, 66.90 H, 4.12 N, 5.20. Found C, 66.825 H, 4.30 N, 4.97. Similarly prepared is N 2 3 furanyl propenyl phthal imide. Step C ss Methylene 2 furanethanamine HCL To a magnetically stirred suspension of 3.50 g 13.83 mmol of the phthalimide prepared in Step B was added 1.34 and 400 ml of ethanol ml 27.64 mmol of hydrazine hydratand the mxture was refluxed under N2 for 1 hour, during which time a thick precipitate formed. The cooled mixture was distilled with 1 M KOH to dissolve the precipitate, then was extracted with ether. The ether layer was washed with 1 M KOH, then was extracted with 1 M HCl. The acid layer was made basic with 5 N NaOH, then was saturated with NaCl and extracted with ether. The ether phase was dried over K2CO3 and concentrated to a yellow oil. Distillation afforded 1.23 g of colorless liquid, bp 400C at 0.5 torr.The amine was taken up in ether, cooled in an ice bath, and a saturated solution of anhydrous HC1 in ether was added dropwise until no more precipitate formed. The volatiles were removed under vacuum and the residue was recrystallized from ethanol ethyl acetate to afford 1.2 g colorless crystals, mp 150 1510C. Anal. Caic d for C7B9NOBC1 ,..S2,68t H, 6.31 N, 8.78. Found C, 52481 H, 6.43 N, 8.61. Similarly prepared is methylene 3 furanethanamine. SC1. The allylic amines of this invention I are dopamine X hydroxylase DBH inhibitors in a mechanism based fashiont inactivation being time, and concentration dependent. Thus the compounds of formula I are expected to be valuable therapeutic agents useful in the treatment of hypertension. The dopamine hydroxylase inhibitory properties of the compounds of this invention can readily be determined by standard and well known procedures such as those procedures set forth in U.S. Patent 4,415,191. For example, determination of whether the DBH inhibition allows timedependent kinetics is exemplified by the procedure wherein enzymatic oxygenation by DBH is determined in aqueous solution in the presence of molecular oxygen, an electron donor such as ascorbate, and the necessary cofactors for the enzyme at a pH of 5 and a temperature of 200 400C, preferrably 370C. The test compound is added at the desired concentration, and the system is incubated. At different time intervals, aliquots are taken and DBH activity is measured using tyramine as the substrate and the reaction followed by measuring the oxygen uptake using a polarographic electrode and an oxygen monitor by the method of S. May et al., J. Biol. Chem. 256, 2258 1981 .The inhibition constants for the inactivation of DBH by each compound are then determined by conventional procedures such as the method of Kitz and Wilson, J. Biol.Chem. 237, 3245 1962 . When the compound shown in TableI was tested according to the above described procedure, the DBH inhibitory activity increased as a function of the time of incubation. The initial rate of decrease of activity increased with increasing concentration of inhibitor. The results in Table I indicate that ,d methylene 2 furanethanamine is potent as illustrated by the rapid rate of inactivation kinact and low inhibition constant KI . TABLE I DBH INHIBITORY ACTIVITY IN VITRO Compound KI mM Kinact. min l ss Methylene 2 Furanethanamine TABLE II ANTI HYPERTENSIVE ACTIVITY IN VIVO Dose Maximum Change Compound mg kg Mean Blood Pressure v0 Methylene 2 10 ip 18 Furanethanamine 30 ip 32 The ability of te tneocohpouWdb.,of . hi invention to lower blood pressure can be determined in vivo using hypertensive rats according to standard and well known procedures. The test compound is administered intraperitoneally ip or orally po to rats and the blood pressure monitored continuously.Since DBB is a major enzyme in the synthetic pathway of the catecholamines, it would be expected that the presence of an inhibitor would act to decrease the amount of catecholamines produced, and thereby have an antihypertensive effect. The results of the testing for this antihypertensive effect are shown in Table II. Thus, based upon these and other standard laboratory techniques known to evaluate dopamine hydroxylase inhibitors, by standard toxicity tests and by standard pharmacological assay for the determination of antihypertensive activity in mammals, and by comparison of these results with the results with known antihypertensive agents, the effective antihypertensive dosage of the compounds of this invention can readily be determined. In general, effective antihypertensive results can be achieved at a dose of about 5 to about 100 mg per kilogram of body weight per day. Of course the specific initial and continuing dosage regimen for each patient will vary according to the nature and severity of the hypertension as determined by the attending diagnostician. In their function as therapeutically useful compounds, it is advantageous to administer the compounds to the host animal in admixture with an acceptable pharmaceutical carrier suitable for enteral or parenteral administration, said carrier constituting a major portion of the admixture. Such preparations may be in such forms as, for example, tablets, capsules and suppositories, or in liquid forms, as for example, elixirs, emulsions, sprays and injectables. In the formulation of pharmaceutical preparations there can be employed such substances which do not react with active substance as, for example, water, gelatin, lactose, starches, magnesium sterate, talc, vegetable oils benzyl alcohols, gums, polyalkylene glycols, petroleum jelly and the like. The active ingredient of such pharmaceutical preparations is preferably present in the preparation in such proportions by weight that the proportion by weight of the active ingredient to be administered lies between 0.1 and 50 .
