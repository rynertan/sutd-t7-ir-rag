# Method and apparatus for one line monitoring of the operation of a complex non linear process control system.

## Abstract
The operation of a nuclear fueled, electric power gener ating unit is monitored by utilizing decision tree analysis of selected system parameters to generate a representation of the real time system status. Current system status is presented to the operator either in the form of conclusory indications, such as verbal statements, representative of system status, or in the form of a visual display of the entire decision tree including indications of the path through the tree representative of current conditions. In either case, indications of off normal conditions are accompanied by directions as to appropriate action to be taken, either by the operator or the automatic control system, to steer the system toward more acceptable conditions. In addition, the status indications are prioritized to indicate the seriousness of the off normal conditions and to direct the sequence of correc tive action to be taken when multiple off normal conditions exist. The decision tree displays are generated either on a color cathode ray tube by a programmed digital computer, or manually on a hard wired panel by an operator who operates switches to illuminate the appropriate branches of the tree based upon meter readings of the selected parameters incorporated into the panel at each branch point. In one embodiment, the invention is applied to monitoring system status when the unit is at power, and in another, it is applied to providing clear, unambiguous indications of the real time status of selected critical safety functions and of appropriate corrective action to be taken, if necessary, following a reactor trip.
