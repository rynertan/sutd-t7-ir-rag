# High speed pulse train generator.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a high speed pulse train generator for generating a train of pulses having arbitrarily close spacing. The apparatus in one form consists of a generator loop 82 , comprising a fiber optic waveguide looped through a directional coupler 86 , with the output fiber 76 serving as the input fiber for a similarly structured multiplexer loop 84 . The lengths of the two loops 82, 84 are adjusted such that the time difference τ in the propagation times of light around the respective loops 82, 84 is small compared to the time of propagation around either loop T, T τ . The times are adjusted to obtain any arbitrary spacing of the pulses in the output pulse train A, B, C, D, E which comprises interleaved pulse trains resulting from each pulse input 92, 100 to the multiplexer loop 84 . Also disclosed is a single loop embodiment for bidirec tional data rate transformation and methods of using all the embodiments.
