# Improved electronic keyboard.

## Abstract
An electronic keyboard includes a base defining a surface having a plurality of faces oriented at different angles. A flexible printed circuit defining rows of switches is disposed on the base surface and rows of switch actuators are disposed on the printed circuit. The actuators comprise key guide strips which define key positions offset along the rows from the switch positions and spring strips which bridge the key and switch positions so that, when keys slidably mounted in the key guide strips are depressed, they close the associated switches. The spring strips are designed to produce minimum operator fatigue and all of the keyboard components coact to give the keyboard a very low profile.
