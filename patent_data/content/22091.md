# Procedure for cleaning a rotor of a spinning unit in an open end type spinning frame, and device for carrying out said procedure.

## Abstract
Device for cleaning an open end spinning turbine comprises a bell 24 which can be fitted to a container 7 holding the spinning rotor 9 and which is mounted on an arm 26 operated by a jack 27 . Said bell 24 bears a piston 30 of which the front tapered end probes the bottom of the throat for uniting the fibres in the rotor 9 when the bell 24 is joined to the container 17 . The procedure consists in letting a certain quantity of fibres enter after breakage of the yarn so as to form a ring of fibres in the rotor and then to halt this ring by means of the piston 30 until the rotor 9 stops, while the scraping or rubbing of the ring of fibres enables the impurities stuck in the area of the throat for uniting the fibres to be detached.
