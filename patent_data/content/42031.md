# Single pass ribbon cartridge for impact printers and impact printer receiving such cartridge.

## Abstract
A ribbon cartridge 16 is provided to be used in a high speed impact printer having means 36 for driving only one reel in the ribbon cartridge, the take up reel. The ribbon cartridge comprises a cartridge housing having an open end, and supply 13 and take up 15 reels rotatably mounted in said housing. The supply reel supports an in ventory of unused ribbon web 12 which runs from the supply reel to the take up reel. A rib 31 is mounted in the cartridge housing facing the open end in a position closer to the supply reel than to the take up reel. The printer into which the ribbon cartridge is to be inserted contains driving means 36 for driving only the take up reel. The printer receiving means into which the cartridge is to be inserted includes a stop element 32 disposed so as to block the rib to stop the engagement of the cartridge and the receiving means when the cartridge is being inserted in a direction towards the undesirable engagement of the drive means with the supply reel rather than with the take up reel.
