# FLOW SENSOR

## Abstract
A flow sensor housing comprises a base member 10 having a flow channel 11 formed therein. The base member 10 comprises means 22, 30 for mounting a flow sensor 18 so that, when a flow sensor 18 is mounted therein, air flowing through the flow channel 11 will be sensed by the flow sensor 18 . The base member comprises the body 10 of a standard semiconductor package. Standard semicon ductor package conductors 12 are integral to the base member. Each conductor 12 has first 13 and second 16, 22 terminal portions. The conductors 12 and terminal portions are positioned so that the first terminal portion 13 of a plurality of conductors 12 are each adapted to connect to a higher level package 15 adapted for receiving a standard semiconductor package 10 and so that the second terminal portion 16, 22 of a plurality of conductors 12 are each adapted for electrical connection to the flow sensor 18 .
