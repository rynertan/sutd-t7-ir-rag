## Description
DEtTRiS POLYCARBOXYLIC ACIDS, FERRIC HYDROXIDE COMPLEXES THEREOF, PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS CONTA1I1NG TRE AND METHODS FOR tHIR MANUFACTURE The present invention relates to dextran derivatives having a plurality of carboxylic acid groups positioned upon intermediate glucose or glucopyranose units of the dextran polymer, and substances formed therefrom by complexing or chelation with colloidal ferric hydroxide to produce stable products of low intravenous toxicity and containing a relatively high iron content. It further relates to a process for producing said polycarboxylic acid compounds as well as the ferric hydroxide complexes described. Dextran C6H10O5 n is a polysaccharide polymer containing a plurality of mainly alpha l, 6 linked glucopyranose or glycosyl units obtained by the action of certain organisms upon sucrose by methods well known to the prior art. It is generally produced in the form of a mixture of polymers of various molecular weights. Iron dextran has been developed and utilized as a satisfactory product for therapeutic use, primarily as an agent for correcting iron deficiencies in animals and humans by parenteral administration, e.g. intravenous or intramuscular injection. This product has certain advantages deriving from low toxicity, low incidence of side reactions and effective rate of ion absorption. It is frequently prepared by forming a complex of dextran with colloidal ferric hydroxide. eertain prior art patents describe ferric hydroxide complexes with dextran or other carbohydrate derivatives in efforts to achieve a desired high iron content and suitable stability and low toxicity. Illustrative of such art are U.S. Patent No. 3 536 696 to Blsop and Bremner and 3ritish Patent No. 1 200 902 to the same inventors. Their U.S. patent describes the formation of ferric hydroxide complexes with a dextran monocarboxylic acid formed by introducing a carboxylic acid group into a terminal unit of the dextran polymer to form a dextran heptonic acid. The Alsop et alBritish patent relates to a procedure for forming the ferric hydroxide complex by controlling the rate of addition of alkali during complexing. No reference is made to the use of any type of dextran polycarboxylic acid. A patent to Dahlberg et al., U.S. Patent No. 3 928 581, states that the use of low molecular weight dextrans in tht formation of iron complexes is undesirable due to toxic and other side effects and proposes instead to utilize certain more complex polymers formed from a saccharine such as sucrose, a polymerization agent such as an epoxide, and a hexitol such as sorbitol, and then reacting with cyanide followed by acidification and hydrolysis to form an end product having a carboxylic acid group attached thereto. Certain other prior art patents describe oxidation with various types of carbohydrate polymers to form products useful in industry, such as tanning agents and textile or paper treating materials. One disadvantage of conventional iron dextran complexes is the fact that it is difficult to obtain stable complexes.in colloidal solution with fairly high iron content say more than 1 , and that as the iron content increases viscosity of the complex increases rapidly so that at higher iron content the higher viscosity impedes administration by injection and decreases the rate of absorption into animal tissues. We have now discovered that certain novel polycarboxylic acid derivatives of dextran can be synthesized which contain a plurality of internal carboxylic acid groups positioned on one or more intermediate glucopyranose units of the dextran polymer, and that these derivatives will form stable colloidal complexes with ferric hydroxide with comparatively high iron content, and that the resulting complexes will have a loworder of toxicity and permit a high degree of absorption of iron, while at the same time providing complexes of lower viscosity for a given iron content than products of the prior art. The novel polycarboxylic acid derivatives of this invention have been found to be produced with a pair of carboxylic acid groups formed upon one or more intermediate glycosyl units as a result of oxidation or cyanidation followed by hydrolysis of corresponding aldehyde groups which in turn have been formed in a preliminary oxidation reaction. We have also discovered that in order for the dextran derivatives to produce suitable injectable products it is necessary for them to have a low intrinsic viscosity, preferably in the range of 0.028 0.085, and that the mean molecular weight of the dextrans in the mixed polymers mast be fairly low, i.e. 9000 or less. On the other hand, if the mean molecular weight of the dextrans in the polymer mixture is extremely low, i.e. below 1000, the product will be too toxic. In referring to mean molecular weight, it rslould be noted that dextrans, as produced commercially, occur in a broad range of molecular weights in admixture and can be fractionated to produce a particular range of molecular weights or to obtain a product having a desired molecular weight composition.In accordance with the present invention, the preferred range of mean molecular weights of the mixed dextran polymer is from 1200 to 6000, since if the molecular weight is too high the product forms a gel and if it is too low the product is unstable and may be too toxic. Where the molecular weight is referred to herein, applicants intend for this to indicate the mean molecular weight of a mixture of dextrans. The polycarboxylic acids of this invention are prepared by first introducing into the dextran molecule by a mild oxidation, a plurality of aldehyde groups in addition to the aldehyde groups already present on the terminal glucose unit, followed by direct further oxidation of the aldehydes, to form the carboxylic acid groups by use of stronger oxidizing agents, such as, bromine, sodium chlorite, etc., or by cyanidation following the preliminary oxidation to aldehydes to produce the cyanohydrin, followed by hydrolysis to produce corresponding acids. The aldehyde groups may be introduced by oxidizing dextran or hydrogenated dextran using sodium or potassium periodate as the oxidizing agent since the periodate will oxidize to form aldehyde groups without further oxidation to acids. As a result of the oxidation, two aldehyde groups may be formed upon each glucose unit oxidized although the total number units oxidized and aldehyde groups obtained will depend upon the severity of the oxidation reaction and the molecular weight of the dextran polymer. The dextran polyaldehyde product thus obtained may be oxidized further utilizing a suitable oxidizing agent such as bromine to produce the corresponding carboxylic acid groups.Alternatively, the aldehydes may be reacted with cyanide to produce the cyanohydrin and hydrolyzed to produce corresponding acids, as referred to above. Other suitable oxidizing agents for the second oxidizing stage to produce the carboxylic acid groups, in addition to bromine are sodium hypobromito, sodium bromite or chlorine, sodium hypochlorite and sodium chlorite. Iodine may also be used. Hydrogenated dextrans useful in this invention may be produced by the procedures described in U.S. Patent No. 3 234 209. In the case of oxidation of hydrogenated dextrans the aldehyde groups and corresponding polycarboxylic acids will be positioned only upon intermediate units since the terminal aldehyda will have been hydrogenated to fore the alcohol, so that the end product will have one less carboxylic acid group than the same unhydrogenated dextran. The acid products are treated to remove inorganic ions by passage through mixed bed iron exchange resins or by dialysis or electrodialysis. The iron complex may be formed by reacting the polycarboxylic acid with purified ferric hydroxide in colloidal solution er suspension preferably at an Initial pH of 6.0 8.7 at a raised temperature in an autoclave. In this procedure the iron may be said to complex with the dextran derivative by the process of chelation. As described below the iron complex can be obtained in the form of a colloidal suspension in water with an elemental iron content of about 5 284o w v in which the water content of the colloidal complex may vary but is generally in the range of 56 8796 w v. Such higher iron concentrations are obtained by concentration with evaporation and the resulting suspensions have been found to be stable even with high iron concentrations. This permits the use of lesser proportions cf dextran and lower non volatile residues for the same amount of iron. The finished product has an extremely low free iron content with less than 0.05 of free ferric and ferrous iron and can easily tolerate usual autoclaving conditions such as 1210C for 30 minutes for sterilization.If desired, the colloidal complex solution of suspension can be dried to powder and used as such or reconstituted in solution, but where it is to be ampouled or vialled for injection purposes it is p raferable to recover the complex in water suspension to use in this form. The product also shows uniform dispersion and good tissue absorption at the injection site when tested on the legs of rabbits. Toxicity is low and the complex is found to be suitable for parenteral human and animal injection through intravenous tests on mice. The reactions referred to may be illustrated as follows EMI7.1 The above illustrates the use of the bromine oxidation insofar as it affects those of the intermediate dextran units which are oxidized to form aldehyde groups. This applies whether the dextran utilized as a starting material is hydrogenated or not. As an alternative to the bromine oxidation, the aldehyde groups introduced into the intermediate glucopyranose units can be treated further to produce the corresponding polycarboxylic acids by using cyanide, such as, potassium cyanide, sodium cyanide or hydrogen cyanide. In such cases the reaction can be illustrated as follows EMI9.1 It will be seen that as the result of the bromine oxidation each unit which is oxidized to aldehyde and carboxylated contains six carbon atoms, while in the case of cyanohydrin reaction to the aldehyde groups to produce the carboxylic acid groups, each unit contains eight carbon atoms. In the case the unhydrogenated dextran is used as a starting material, the terminal aldehyde group will react as follows using the cyanohydrin reaction. EMI11.1 In the case of the hydrogenated dextran, the terminal aldehyde group is hydrogenated and does not get oxidized to form a terminal carboxylic acid group. The total number of aldehyde groups produced in each dextran molecule will depend on the degree of oxidation, or upon the nature and concentration of the oxidizing agent used and the molecular weight of dextran. In general it is preferred to carry out the reaction under such conditions that from 2 to 10 intermediate aldehyde groups are formed in each dextran polymer which means that aldehyde groups are formed in from 1 to 5 internal glucose units of the polymer with the result that the final polycarboxylic acid will be a dextran derivative containing from 2 to 10 carboxylic acid groups positioned in pairs on internal units of the polymer.In the case of unhydrogenated dextran as the starting material, the terminal aldehyde when oxidized and or reacted with cyanide will result in an additional carboxylic acid group, in which case the dextran derivative would preferably have from 3 to 11 carboxylic acid groups. In view of the ease of oxidation of the aldehyde groups as long as excess oxidant is used, all of the aldehyde groups are oxidized to polycarboxylic acids. The number of intermediate aldehyde groups formed is determined by standard reducing sugars tests and the number of carboxylic acid groups present in the polycarboxylic acid groups present in the polycarboxylic acid can be determined by titration. To illustrate further, the structures of the intermediate and final products obtained by the two stage oxidation or oxidationcyanidation processes referred to, the typical structures obtained at each stage are shown below. A. Structure of a representative dextran polymer, unhydrogenated.EMI13.1 B. Structure of A, following preliminary oxidation to form aldehydes.EMI14.1 C. Structure of B after cyanidation preparatory to hydrolysis.EMI15.1 D. Final product, after hydrolysis of C, to produce three pairs of carboxylic acid groups upon three intermediate glycosyl units, plus a terminal carboxylic acid group.EMI16.1 E.

Instead of complexing with ferric hydroxide as described in the foregoing examples, a ferric iron salt such as ferric chloride in. solution may be utilized in place thereof as illustrated in the following example, thereby forming ferric.hydroxide for the complex in site. Example 7 A solution of ferric chlpride, having its, Fe content of appr,oximately 10 w v , is added into a plastic tank.A selected purified low molecular weight dextran polycarboxylic acid polymer solution, having its dextran content of approximately 16 , is mixed in a Fe dextran ratio of 1.0 0.8 in the same tank.

In one comparative test carried out against a product known as Gleptosil which is understood to be produced in accordance with U.S. Patent No. 3536696 the following results were obtained using a BrookfieldViscometer, Model LVF. Viscosity CPS Fe Content at 250 C Usher et al Iron Dcxtran 20 18 Gleptosil 20 42.5 Usher et al Iron Dextran 258 72 Gleptosil 25 105 in carrying out the above test, both products were tested initially at 208 iron content, and then concentrated to 25E iron by heating and evaporation. Further evaporation of the Usher et al product to.288 iron was carried out to obtain a fluid product but it was not possible to evaporate the commercial product to that concentration by heating and evaporation in the absence of a vacuum while still retaining sufficient fluidity for viscosity comparisons. The greatly reduced viscosity of applicants product permits more rapid absorption into animal tissue and at the same time permits the use of conventional injecting equipment to inject higher iron content products. While we do not wish to be bound by any theory as the reason for our ability to obtain an improved iron dextran with a high stable iron content, it is believed that the presence of a plurality of carboxylic acid groups positioned upon intermediate units of the dextran polymer molecule provide complexing sites for the ferric hydroxide which permit the association of greater amounts of the ferric hydroxide in a manner which binds the ferric hydroxide molecules to a higher degree than in complexes of the prior art.,
