# Method of forming powdered metal articles.

## Abstract
In forming an article, such as a turbine blade, of metal powder, a container 22 is first formed by electroplating a thin layer of metal over a pattern having a configuration which corresponds to the configuration of the article. The pattern is then removed to leave a container having a cavity with a configuration corresponding to the configuration of the article. The container is filled with metal powder and sealed. The container is then at least partially enclosed with a rigid body 32 of fluid permeable material having inner side surface areas disposed in abutting engagement with the container. Heat and fluid pressure are transmitted through the rigid body to compact the container and metal powder. The fluid pressure causes the side walls of the container to move away from the inner side surfaces of the rigid body of fluid permeable material. As this is occurring, the rigid body of fluid permeable material supports the container and holds it against excessive deflection under the influence of stresses induced in the container.
