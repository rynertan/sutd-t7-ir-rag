## Description
This invention relates to a new process for the production of 7 amino 3 alkoxymethyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid derivatives of formula I, in which R signifies lower alkyl. Processes for the production of these compounds are known but have certain disadvantages, for example moderate yields only. Thus, for example, processes involving reaction of 7 aminocephalosporinic acid 7 ACA with lower alkanols in the presence or absence of catalysts are well known from for example Belgian patent 719,710, Japanese patent applications 57 192 392 and 59 163 387 and UK Patent application 2,110,688 but tend to give low yields. Other known processes proceed over 7 substituted usually acylated 7 ACA derivatives but these processes require higher technical effort and raw material requirements basically requiring 3 steps 7 substitution acylation of 7 ACA, introduction of the 3 alkoxy methyl substituent and removal of the 7 substituent deacylation and are often also accompanied by low overall yields see, for example Japanese patent applications 59 163 388 and 57 192 392 and J.Med.Chem. The present invention provides a novel process for the production of the compounds of formula I comprising reacting 7 ACA of formula II, with a compound of formula III, The process of the invention is suitably effected in an organic solvent, for example an organic nitrile such as acetonitrile or propionitrile, a nitroalkane, such as nitromethane, or a sulphone, such as sulfolan. Preferred lower alkanols of formula III have 1 to 6, more preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and include methanol, ethanol, The resulting compounds of formula I may be isolated and purified using conventional techniques. The process of the invention leads to the products of formula I in high yield for example in yields of over 60 and brings therefore substantial economies particularly as it operates in simple manner with relatively inexpensive chemicals. Furthermore, in contrast to certain known processes, the formation of undesired by products, for example 7 ACA lactone, can be largely avoided and the product of formula I can therefore be isolated more simply since fewer by products need to be removed. The compounds of formula I are known starting materials for the production of valuable known cephalosporin antibiotics. The following example, in which temperatures are in degrees Centigrade, illustrates the invention. 24 g of boron trifluoride gas is introduced under an insert atmosphere in to 60 g of sulfolan. 6.5 ml of methanol are added and the temperature set at 50 . 10.88 g of 7 aminocephalosporanic acid are added to the reaction mixture which is then stirred for 75 minutes at 50 . The mixture is diluted with cold methanol and the pH adjusted to 3.5 by addition of triethylamine. The precipitated mixture is stirred for a further 1 hour at 0 and the precipitate is filtered off, washed with methanol and dried to obtain the heading compound, having the following NMR data which corresponds to published NMR data for this product
