# VOICE ACTUATED MACHINE CONTROL

## Abstract
A voice actuated control system suitable for use on a computer numerically controlled CNC machine tool in cludes a pair of radio frequency transmitters and a pair of radio frequency receivers, one of the radio frequency receivers and one of the radio frequency transmitters being located at the machine tool site and the other radio frequency receiver and radio frequency transmitter being carried by the human machine tool operator. Operator spoken commands are transmitted through the operator s transmitter to the machine tool receiver which outputs an audio signal to a voice interpreter that converts the received voice commands into digital signals which are transmitted to the CNC machine tool control system to control machine tool operation. Digital signals generated by the CNC machine tool control system, either in response to received operator commands or in accordance with variations in machine tool operating conditions, are converted by a speech synthesizer into synthesized audio signals representing speech ph rases indicative of machine tool operating conditions. The speech synthesizer audio signals are transmitted to the operator to audibly inform him or her that the previously transmitted voice commands have been received or that further instruc tions are required.
