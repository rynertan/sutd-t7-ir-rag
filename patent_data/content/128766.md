# Process for preparation of high silica faujasite type zeolite.

## Abstract
A faujasite type zeolite having a high SiO₂ Al₂O₃ ratio is prepared by simultaneously and continuously supplying an aqueous solution of an alkali metal silicate and an aqueous so lution of an aluminium containing compound whereby the al kali metal silicate is continuously reacted with the aluminium containing compound to prepare a homogeneous phase com pound of a granular amorphous aluminosilicate containing alu minium in an amount of 10 to 16 by weight, as Al₂O₃ and based on the anhydride and then, crystallizing the granular homogeneous phase amorphous aluminosilicate in an aqueous alkali metal hydroxide solution having a concentration of 4 to 10 by weight.
