# INSULATION DISPLACEMENT TERMINAL

## Abstract
An insulation displacement termina comprsesa base 20 having a pair of integrally connected side plates 22 and 24 and an integrally connected flex arm 30 disposed between the side plates. The side plates have guide slots 26 and 28 formed in part by inwardly staggered legs 38 and 40 . The flex arm has laterally spaced blades 34 and 36 which bias an insulated conductor 52 received in the guide slots against the edges of the inwardly staggered legs of the side plates to establish four point electrical contact with the core 56 of the insulated conductor under the constant pressure of the flex arm.
