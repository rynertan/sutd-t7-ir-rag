## Description
This invention relates to paperboard packages, such as cigarette packs, and blanks therefor, and more particularly to a pop up cigarette box. Cigarettes are typically sold in packs of twenty to twenty five cigarettes. Two types of packs are in general use. The first type is the soft pack, which is a bundle of cigarettes wrapped in foil, overwrapped with a paper wrapper which usually has brand and other information printed on its outer side, and overwrapped again with a sealed cellophane layer. The second type is the box or flip top box, which is a hard paperboard box containing a foil wrapped cigarette bundle and having a hinged lid at the top. Typically, a paperboard insert surrounds the bundle at least near the top of the box, providing a frictional engagement surface to retain the lid in the closed position when desired. A cutout in this insert allows a smoker to remove cigarettes from the box. Still another type of package _ although not of commercial importance _ is known from DE C 663 292, which has been used as the basis for the preamble of the independent claim. Each type of pack has its own advantages and disadvantages. The soft pack collapses as cigarettes are removed from it, taking up less space in a smoker s pocket or purse as the contents are smoked, while providing an approximate external indication of the number of cigarettes remaining in the pack. However, once the cellophane wrapper of a soft pack is opened, it cannot be resealed. As a result, any loose tobacco in the pack may eventually drop from the pack into the smoker s pocket or purse. The cigarettes can also be damaged if the pack is roughly handled. For these reasons, many smokers prefer the flip top box, which can be resealed to prevent loose tobacco from dropping out, and which offers better protection for the cigarettes within it. It is an object of this invention to provide a cigarette pack which will prevent the dropping out of loose tobacco. It is also an object of this invention to provide a cigarette pack of increased attractiveness to smokers. The technical solution proposed by indicated in the characterising portion of claim 1. The invention will be further described, by way of example, with reference to the drawings in which A preferred embodiment of the folding carton of the present invention is the cigarette pack shown in FIGS. 1 4. Cigarette pack 10 includes a caddy member 20, a back cover member 12, and a front cover member 13, and when closed is similar in size and shape to known cigarette packs. Caddy member 20 differs from known flip top boxes in the absence of a lid and in that it is shorter, so that when caddy member 20 is loaded with cigarettes, the cigarettes not shown protrude from caddy member 20 for easy withdrawal by the smoker. Caddy member 20 has front and back walls 40, 41, side walls 42, 43, and bottom 30. Back cover member 12 has a back wall 31, top and bottom walls 32, 33, and side walls 34, 35. Front cover member 13 has a front wall 14, top and bottom walls 36, 37, a side wall 38 and a second side wall not shown. Back cover member 12 nestingly engages bottom, back and side walls, 30, 41, 42, 43 of caddy member 20. Front cover member 13, in turn, nestingly engages top, bottom and side walls 32, 33, 34, 35 of back cover member 12 and front wall 40 of caddy member 20. Front wall 40 of caddy member 20 is hinged to the inside top corner of front cover member 13 by lifting web 44, and back wall 41 of caddy member 20 is hinged to the inside top corner of back cover member 12 by lifting web 45. Back cover member 12 and front cover member 13 are hinged together at 21 for pivoting between the closed position shown in FIG. 1 and the open position shown in FIGS. 2 and 3. As seen in FIG. 1, cigarette pack 10 resembles an ordinary flip box in size and shape when back and front cover members 12, 13 are in the closed position. Cover members 12, 13 are retained in the closed position by the frictional engagement of corners 22, 23 of back cover member 12 with the interior of top wall 36 of front cover member 13, thereby preventing the dropping out of loose tobacco from cigarette pack 10. Thumb notches 15 one shown are provided so that back cover member 12 can be grasped for opening. When cigarette pack 10 is open, as seen in FIGS. 2 and 3, lifting webs 44, 45 pull caddy member 20 up from the bottom of cigarette pack 10 and cause it to project from the space between the cover members 12, 13. The tips of the cigarettes not shown in caddy member 11 preferably extend beyond the top walls 32, 36 of the cover members 12, 13. In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 1 4, front cover member 13 has a greater depth than rear cover member 12, so front lifting web 44 is made longer than rear lifting web 45 to enable caddy member 20 to clear front cover member 13 when cigarette pack 10 is open. As shown in phantom in FIG. 1, lifting webs 44, 45 also push caddy member 20 to the bottom of cigarette pack 10 when cigarette pack 10 is closed. A paperboard blank 50 from which caddy member 11 is preferably erected is shown in FIG. 5. Blank 50 has a front wall panel 51 defined by parallel long, side, front defining score lines 100, 101, a short, bottom, front defining score line 102 perpendicular to score lines 100, 101, and edge 200 of blank 50.

An outer top skirt panel 700 is defined by score line 124, long, rear, top skirt defining score line 130 parallel to score line 124, and parallel short, side, top skirt defining score lines 131, 132 perpendicular to score line 124. An inner top skirt panel 701 is defined by score line 130, perforation line 402 parallel to score line 130, and edges 239, 240 of blank 70. A first top skirt closure tab 702 is defined by score line 131, cut 308, and edges 241, 242, 246 of blank 70. A second top skirt closure tab 703 is defined by score line 132, cut 310 and edges 243, 244, 247 of blank 70.

A front lifting tab 705 is defined by score line 133 and edges 239, 240, 245 of blank 70. When blanks 50, 60 and 70 are erected, the rim panels of blank 60 form the top, bottom and side walls of back cover member 12 and the skirt panels of blank 70 form the top, bottom and side walls of front cover member 13. The folding over of panels 74 and 75 onto panels 72 and 73, respectively, of blank 70 forms the two notches 15 from the four partial circular cutouts 500 503. Inner bottom skirt panel 77 is adhered to outer bottom rim panel 67 to form hinge 21. Rear lifting tab 605 is adhered to rear wall panel 54 and front lifting tab 705 is adhered to front wall panel 51. In the embodiment of FIGS. 1 4, back cover member 12 nests flush within front cover member 13. In the alternate embodiment shown in FIGS. 8 10, cigarette pack 80 has caddy member 20, back cover member 82, and front cover member 83. In this embodiment, cover members 82, 83 are approximately equal in depth and back cover member 82 protrudes from front cover member 83. Lifting webs 84, 85 are approximately equal in length so that caddy member 20 is centered between member 82, 83 when cigarette pack 80 is open. No notches are provided for opening cigarette pack 80 because protruding back cover member 82 is readily grasped, although notches may be provided if desired. Because back cover member 82 does not extend as far into front cover member 83 as back cover member 12 does into front cover member 13, the frictional engagement between corners 802, 803 and the interior of front cover member 83 may not be sufficient to retain cigarette pack 80 in its closed position. Therefore a locking means may be provided. One such locking means is shown in FIGS. 9 and 10 and includes two resilient members 86, 87 protruding at opposing angles from opposing faces of cover members 82, 83. When cigarette pack 80 is closed, resilient members 84, 85 interlock to retain it in the closed position. However, members 84, 85 are sufficiently resilient to be pulled apart manually to allow cigarette pack 80 to be opened. Other suitable locking means may also be provided. Locking means can also be used in the embodiment of FIGS. 1 4, if desired. The cigarette pack described herein provides a closed container which prevents the dropping out of loose tobacco. It is also attractive to smokers because of its novel means for opening. The exterior of the pack can be printed with brand and other information and with decorative material in the same manner as other cigarette packs. Similarly, the cigarettes contained within the pack can be wrapped in foil in the manner known to those skilled in the art, and the pack can be overwrapped with cellophane to keep the cigarettes fresh.
