# Tank Washers.

## Abstract
In a tank washer of the kind in which jets of cleaning, and subsequently, rinsing liquid under pressure are delivered from opposed nozzles 23 which oscillate through, prefer ably, 90 about the first horizontal as illustrated axis of a tubular carrier 21 of said nozzles 23 whilst said carrier 21 and nozzles 23 are also rotated in steps about a second vertical as illustrated axis, the oscillation of the tubular nozzle carrier 21 is brought about by the axial reciprocation of a piston 42 which piston 42 is directly connected by means 28,29,30 to that carrier 21 at a location which is spaced from said first axis. The liquid under pressure causes the operating movements of the tank washer and means 14 is described and illustrated to counterbalance the high axial pressure exerted on a frame work member of the tank washer by such liquid entering the latter through a tubular inlet fitting 1 .
