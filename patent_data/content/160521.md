A drug such as an antitumor agent or anti biotic can preferentially be carried to a morbid part, for example, injured tissue or tumor site, by administering its complex with fibronectin combined through an oxidized dextran to repair the morbid part. The complex is prepared by reacting the drug, an oxidized dextran having a cleaved structure of aldohexopyranose ring, and fibronectin.
