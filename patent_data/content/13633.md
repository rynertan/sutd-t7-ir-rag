Sorting apparatus 10 in which a sheet advancing along a pre determined path is collected in one of a plurality of mov able sheet receiving stations 12 . One of the receiving sta tions 12 is aligned with the sheet path. A guide 18 moves from an inoperative position spaced from the receiving sta tions 12 to an operative position coupling the aligned sheet receiving station 12 with the sheet path. This enables the sheet to advance into the receiving station 12 .
