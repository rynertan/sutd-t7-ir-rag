# Computer support.

## Abstract
A corner mounting unit for a computer and like equip ment quickly attaches to two adjoining surfaces at the same height. The mounting unit includes a frame having a slightly elevated plate 30 with attachments positioned at selected locations whereby computer components or accessories may be positioned and firmly supported directly or indirectly at any of such variety of locations. A keyboard or bridging surface 11 is captured by the frame and extends forwardly of the unit at a lower elevation and bridging the included angle between the adjoining surfaces. A separate adjustable keyboard may be employed. Also adjustable monitor turn tables 20 or swing arm attachments 22, 23 may be secured to the unit to position the computer components or accessor ies at the desired location for effective use. The unit eliminates the need for an expensive and complex intermedi ate or third top and the requisite hardware. A bridging clamp is provided at the intersection of the work surfaces so that the unit serves additionally to join, rigidify and stabilize such work surfaces.
