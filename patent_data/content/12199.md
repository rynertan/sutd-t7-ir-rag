# Attachment for fluid pipe lines for controllably dissolving solid material into the fluid stream.

## Abstract
An apparatus for controllably dispersing material into a fluid stream with the apparatus having a housing 12 with a bottom section that attaches to a pipe line and a top section having a recess for a porous container 11 to support a solid fluid soluble material 9 . The porous con tainer 11 can be controllably inserted into a fluid stream through coaction of a spring 24 and cap 30 to control the amount of soluble material 9 entering the fluid stream. A lower seal 25 on the porous container 11 prevents fluid from escaping from the line when the porous container 11 is in the up position and an upper seal 21 prevents leakage past the cap 30 when the valve is in operation.
