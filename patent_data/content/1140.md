# Electrophotographic recording material.

## Abstract
An electrophotographic recording material comprising a photoconductive layer incorporating photoconductive zinc oxide in the presence of a compound within the scope of the following general formula R SH wherein R represents 1 an unsubstituted aliphatic hydrocarbon group containing at least 5 carbon atoms or 2 an aliphatic hydrocarbon group substituted with a COOQ group wherein Q is an organometallic group or an aliphatic hydrocarbon group, containing at least 5 carbon atoms, or 3 an aliphatic hydrocarbon group substituted with a COOH group and containing at least two methylene groups between the COOH group and the SH group, and said general formula including the modification wherein the hydrogen atom of the SH group is substituted to form an organometal mercaptide. The above compound improves the charge retention of the photoconductive layer, i.e. lowers its dark decay, under conditions of high relative humidity.
