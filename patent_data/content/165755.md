# Disk drive storage system having means for compensating for seek driving forces coupled between head actuators.

## Abstract
Seek drive forces coupled between head actuators in a magnetic disk storage system employing separately controll able head actuators are prevented from affecting reliable head actuator operation. For this purpose a compensating signal is derived proportional to the driving current em ployed in performing an actuator seek operation. This compensating signal is fed forward into the drive circuit of the other actuator so as to cause this other actuator to begin moving its heads in a direction opposite to that which would be caused by the later arriving coupled drive forces, thereby making it possible to prevent driving forces coupled between actuators from deleteriously interferring with reliable actuator operation.
