# Method and device for manufacturing magnetic recording medium.

## Abstract
The invention provides a method and a device for mass producing a magnetic recording medium which has excellent wear and corrosion resistances and uniform quality along the longitudinal and transverse directions of an elongated base body, wherein the elongated base body in a vacuum chamber is fed to continuously deposit a ferro magnetic material thereon, while a gas is sprayed in the vicinity of an incident angle control section of a mask for controlling an angle of incidence of a vapor flow from a vapor source to the elongated base body. The angle of incidence is kept constant to prevent deposition of the vapor material on the incident angle control section, and simul taneously, a uniform oxide film is formed on the ferromagne tic layer using a gas containing at least oxygen.
