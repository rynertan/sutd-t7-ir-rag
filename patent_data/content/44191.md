# Method of making a composite leaf spring for determining the magnitude of a load and a composite leaf spring manufactured by said method.

## Abstract
A member of composite material 1 incorporates at least one strain responsive member 13, 14 within a part at which a strain is induced by a load in use. A signal which is a function of a strain detected by the strain responsive member is communicated to an indicator or monitoring device which registers the applied load causing the strain. In one embodiment a leaf spring 1 for a vehicle comprises upper and lower elements of one or more superimposed strips of pre impregnated longitudinally ex tending carbon fibres and an inner element of one or more strips of pre impregnated glass fibres. During laying up of the strips two strain gauges 13, 14, which may be on or integral with a carrier strip, and their leads 13a, 13b, 14a, 14b are introduced into the active length of the spring which experiences a bending moment on the application of a load. The gauges 13, 14 are positioned at a predetermined distance apart which is maintained when the member 1 is cured, as by hot press moulding.
