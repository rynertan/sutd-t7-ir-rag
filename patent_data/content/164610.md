# Fluid tight slide fastener.

## Abstract
A fluid tight slide fastener comprises a pair of slide fas tener halves 10, 10 20, 20 each including a support tape 11, 12 , a row of continuous coupling elements 12 extend ing longitudinally along the inner edge of the tape 11, 21 on one side thereof, and an elestomeric sealing member 15 overlying on the other side of the tape 11, 21 . The tape 11, 21 has a longitudinal ridge 18 , 28 substantially defining the inner edge and supporting the row of coupling elements 12 laterally longitudinally by means of stitching threads 14 . A portion of the threads 14 is disposed adjacent to the ridge 18 , 28 to prevent the latter from moving remotely from the coupling elements row 12 for thereby supporting the ridge intimately enough to ensure the abuttment of opposed seal ing edges 16 of the tapes when the fastener halves are coupled together.
