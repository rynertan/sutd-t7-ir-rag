These compositions are useful for treating helminthiasis either orally or by intrarumenal injection, and are particularly valuable for administration by intrarumenal injection. Certain anthelmintic benzimidazole derivatives are known see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,080,461 4,002,640 3,965,113 3,929,821 3,915,986 3,480,642 3,574,845 3,017,415 3,657,267 South African Patent No. 6,800,351 and Belgian Patent No. 793,358. Rafoxanide is a known fasciolicide see U.S. Pat. No. 3,914,418. Certain combinations of oxfendazole and other anthelmintics are known. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos.4,436,737 8oray , 4,173,632 Cruthers , 4,166,858 Rowlands and 4,159,337 Rowlands .

The solvent used must be pharmaceutically acceptable and chemically stable, must be capable of dissolving or suspending each component, and must not have an unreasonably high viscosity so that the formulation may be administered with a rumen injector or oral applicator. The formulation of veterinary agents should also permit easy clean up of the rumen injector or oral applicator after use.The surfactant used may enhance the activity of the formulation but must not reduce it.

Mebendazole and similar anthelmintic benzimidazole derivatives may be made by the process described in U.S.Patent No. 3,657,267, which is incorporated herein by reference. To prepare the composition of the invention, rafoxanide is dissolved in a quantity of the solvent with stirring. When glycofurol is used as the solvent, it is preferred to heat the solvent to about 450C to facilitate formation of the solution. When dimethyl isosorbide is used, no heating is necessary. The Triton X100, where desired, is then added and the solution mixed. The anthelmintic benzimidazole derivative, where desired, is then suspended in the solution, preferably using a homogenizer, and the solution diluted to full volume with more solvent. All of the examples set forth below are for oxfendazole. However, other benzimidazoles of formula I above can be substituted for oxfendazole. EXAMPLE 1 Rafoxanide, 250 g, was dissolved in 750 mL of glycofurol at 450C with stirring. Then, 125 g of oxfendazole was suspended in the solution using a high speed homogenizer. The suspension was then brought up to full volume by adding glycofurol to make 1 liter. The composition was then administered in 1 to 20 mL doses. In a similar manner a concentration of 225 mg ml oxfendazole can be prepared. EXAMPLE 2 Rafoxanide, 250 g, was dissolved in 750 mL of dimethyl isosorbide at 250C with stirring.

EXAMPLE 7 Rafoxanide, 250 g, was dissolved in 750 mL of glycofurol at 45aC with stirring. Then 250 g of Triton X100 was added and the solution mixed. The solution was then brought up to full volume by adding glycofurol to make 1 liter. The composition was then administered in 1 to 20 mL doses. EXAMPLE 8 Rafoxanide, 250 g, was dissolved in 750 mL of dimethyl isosorbide at 250C with stirring. Then 250 g of Triton X100 was added and the solution mixed. The solution was then brought up to full volume by adding dimethyl isosorbide to make 1 liter. The composition was then administered in 1 to 20 mL doses. EXAMPLE 9 Rafoxanide, 150 g, was dissolved in 750 mL of glycofurol at 450C with stirring. Then, 90.6 g of oxfendazole was suspended in the solution using a high speed homogenizer. The suspension was then brought up to full volume by adding glycofurol to make 1 liter. The composition was then administered in 1 to 20 mL doses. EXAMPLE 10 Rafoxanide, 150 g, was dissolved in 750 mL of dimethyl isosorbide at 250C with stirring. Then, 90.6 g of oxfendazole was suspended in the solution using a high speed homogenizer. The suspension was then brought up to full volume by adding dimethyl isosorbide to make liter. The composition was then administered in 1 to 23 mL doses. EXAMPLE 11 Rafoxanide, 150 g, was dissolved in 750 mL of clycofurol at 450C with stirring. Then 150 g of Triton X100 was added and the solution mixed.

EXAMPLE 13 The following is an experimental procedure to demonstrate the efficacy of the invention Twenty 20 head of cattle, preferably from a single source, known to be infected with nematode parasites as evidenced by positive fecal egg counts are used. The animals would be preferably of one sex, either all steers or all heifers, and about six months of age.. They will have been grazing pastures known to to be contaminated with cattle parasite eggs and larvae. About 150 metacercariae of Fasciola hepatica are administered to each animal. The animals are treated 10 12 weeks after infection with F. hepatica. The animals were treated with a control, a composition containing oxfendazole and rafoxanide, or a composition containing rafoxanide.Animals are then subjected to necropsy between 7 and 14 days post treatment. Gastrointestinal tract, lungs, and liver are examined using standard parasitological techniques for nematode and trematode parasites. The compositions of the invention prove to be efficacious in this assay. EXAMPLE 14 The following is an experimental procedure to demonstrate blood plasma levels of the active compounds administered. Ten cows were selected for study. Four cows were injected rumenally with a composition containing rafoxanide at the rate of 1 ml per 50 kg body weight, three cows were injected rumenally with a composition containing oxfendazole and rafoxanide at the rate of 1 ml per 50 kg body weight, and three cows were dosed orally with rafoxanide in commercially available form at the rate of 7.5 mg per kg body weight. Blood samples were drawn and analyzed before administration and on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 10, and 13 following administration. The compositions of the invention show blood plasma levels equal or superior to plasma levels obtained using commercially available formulations.
