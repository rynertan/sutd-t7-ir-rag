## Description
Crosslinked, porous polymers for controlled delivery of agricultural ingredientsIn the pharmaceutical industry much work has been devoted during recent years to improving the effectiveness, safety and practicality of orally administered drugs. Work has been directed toward the goal of prolonging the release of an orally taken drug over a period of several hours.Such a prolonged release has the following advantages peak blood levels of the drug, which sometimes represent toxic levels, are avoided since not all the drug is released into the stomach at the same time secondly, drug concentrations in the blood are maintained for a longer time within the therapeutic range, thereby increasing the overall effectiveness of the drug and reducing the overall dose size necessary for treatment thirdly, drugs which would have to be taken in conventional form several times daily for the treatment of chronic diseases, can be administered in once or twice a day dose forms, which are safer and more convenient for the patient.Pharmaceutical compositions directed toward meeting these objectives are described in our copending application Serial No. 523,236.It has now been found that the crosslinked polymer matrix useful for the controlled release of a pharmaceutical medicament can be useful as well in the controlled release in an aqueous environment of agricultural chemicals.As is described in detail later in this application, the instant crosslinked polymer matrix has a limited swelling capacity in water and a much greater swelling capacity in ethanol. It is thus somewhat hydrophobic in nature the degree of hydrophobicity being determined by the exact proportions of monomers and crosslinking agent macromer used in its preparation.U.S. Patent No. 4,192,827 described water insoluble hydrophilic copolymers prepared from the same monomers and macromers, but in quite different proportions so that the copolymers are clearly hydrophilic in nature and highly swellable in water. These copolymers of U.S. 4,192,827 are disclosed as being useful as carriers for pharmaceuticals, fragrances and agricultural chemicals.It is an object of this invention to produce a controlled release, delivery composition comprising an effective amount of an active agricultural ingredient in a polymer substrate which can swell in polar organic solvents to a much greater than conventional polymers used for drug delivery and which therefore can be imbibed with active ingredients to a correspondingly high concentration while at the same time exhibiting only a moderate degree of swelling in water,The ability of a polymer to absorb a large amount of water has always been considered a necessity for a polymeric orally used drug delivery matrix. Hydrogels have therefore been the only materials previously used for this purpose.It has now very unexpectedly been discovered that polymers can be synthesized in aqueous suspension or in bulk which can swell in organic solvents such as ethanol to a much greater extent than conventional hydrogels, being capable of absorbing from 40 to 90 by weight of ethanol and typically showing a ratio of swelling ethanol water of 3 1 to 9 1.Therefore these beads can be loaded from solution in an organic solvent with a soluble agricultural chemical to correspondingly much higher concentration levels than can conventional hydrogel type polymeric carriers. At the same time it has been discovered that even if the amount of water absorbed by the novel polymers is lower than that of conventional hydrogels, namely lying in the range of 2 20 by weight of water, they still satisfy the requirement of releasing imbibed agricultural chemical completely in a reasonable time frame.The novel controlled release, agricultural chemical delivery compositions of the present invention comprise A a crosslinked copolymer, capable of welling in ethanol to give a swollen copolymer containing at least 40 by weight of ethanol, and capable of welling in water to give a swollen copolymer containing no more than 20 by weight of water, where the swelling ratio ethanol water is 2 1 to 22 1, and B an effective amount of an active agricultural ingredient.The agricultural chemical containing, copolymer beads are synthesized by free radical initiated polymerization of the abovementiqned monomers in aqueous suspension, preferably in the presence of 1 50 by weight of an inert diluent, followed by imbibing the washed and dried polymer with the active ingredient dissolved in an organic solvent which solvent is subsequently removed by heating or in vacuo.It is a further object of this invention to prepare copolymers which exhibit unexpectedly high degrees of swelling in organic solvents while their degree of swelling in water is only moderate or low.Therefore, they can imbibe large amounts of active ingredients from organic solutions, yet are ideally suited for the controlled and prolonged release of such active ingredients into an aqueous environment.The instant invention pertains to a controlled release, agricultural chemical delivery composition which comprises A a crosslinked copolymer, capable of swelling in ethanol to give a swollen copolymer containing at least 40 by weight of ethanol, and capable of swelling in water to give a swollen copolymer containing no more than 20 by weight of water, where the swelling ratio ethanol water is 2 1 to 22 1, which copolymer is the copolymerization product of a 50 to 99 by weight of said copolymer of aa a water insoluble monoolefinic monomer, or mixture of said monomers, or a waterinsoluble monoolefinic monomer, or mixture of said monomers with 0 to 45 by weight of total monomers of bb a water soluble monoolefinic monomer, or mixture of said water soluble monomers, with b 50 to 1 by weight of said copolymer of a divinyl or polyvinyl crosslinking agent having a molecular weight of 100 to 10,000, but where b is not more than 20 mol of component a , and B an effective amount of an active agricultural ingredient. Preferably the crosslinked copolymer has a swelling ratio ethanol water of 3 1 to 15 1 most preferably 4 1 to 8 1.In order to assure that the instant copolymers have high swellability in ethanol coupled with moderate swellability in water it is preferable that at least a third by weight of the water insoluble monomer of component a is a monomer with an alkyl group of 4 to 21 carbon atoms.A preferred embodiment of the instant invention is a composition wherein the copolymer A is the copolymerization product of 75 98 by weight of component a and 25 2 by weight of component b .

Other such di and polyvinyl cross linking agents, including divinyl ethers and di allyl compounds are described in U.S. 4,192,827, useful polysiloxane di and polyvinyl compounds are described in U.S. 4,136,250. The appropriate portions of said patents are incorporated herein by reference.Examples of such crosslinking agents include trimethylolpropane triacrylate, neopentylglycol diacrylate, pentaerythritol and dipentaerythritol di , tri , tetra , penta , hexa acrylates ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol acrylates, divinyl ether divinylbenzene allyl methacrylate diallyl maleate diallylamine divinyl sulfone triallyl cyanurate.Such a crosslinking agent is a terminal diolefinic hydrophobic macromer having a molecular weight from about 400 to about 8000, said macromer having the formulaEMI9.1 wherein R1 is a polycondensate chain having a molecular weight from about 200 to about 8000, which is the residue of a poly propylene oxide or poly tetramethylene oxide glycol having ether linkages R2 is hydrogen, methyl or CH2COOR4, wherein R4 is hydrogen or an alkyl group with up to 10 carbon atoms R3 is hydrogen or COOR4, with the proviso that at least one of R2 and R3 is hydrogen X is oxa, COO , or CONR5 , wherein Rs is hydrogen or alkyl with up to 5 carbon atoms and Y is a direct bond or the radical R6 Zl CO NH R7 NH CO Z2 , wherein R6 is linked to X and represents branched or linear alkylene with up to 7 carbon atoms Z1 and Z2 is oxa or NR5 and R7 is the diradical of an aliphatic or aromatic diisocyanate, with the proviso that in case X is oxa, Y is different from a direct bond and R2 and R3 are hydrogen.Preferably R1 is a poly propylene oxide or poly tetramethylene oxide chain with a molecular weight of about 600 to about 4,000.Preferably the macromer is a polytetramethyleneoxide glycol with a molecular weight of about 600 to about 4000, endcapped with toluene or isophorone diisocyanate and reacted with 2 moles of a hydroxyalkyl acrylate or methacrylate, wherein alkyl has 2 to 4 carbon atoms.Other preferred crosslinking agents include the C2 C6 alkylene diacrylates or methacrylates, 3 oxapentamethylene diacrylate, 3 oxapentamethylene dimethacrylate and trimethylolpropane triacrylate1 or mixtures thereof.The amount of crosslinking agent can vary from 1 to 50 by weight, but should not contribute more than 20 mol. of the total monomer mixture. Preferred crosslinking agents are ones with a molecular weight from 500 5,000, containing polyalkylene ether units, especially as described in U.S. 4,192,827.A particularly preferred embodiment of the instant invention are those compositions where the copolymer A is the copolymerization product of 85 99 of component a and 15 1 of component b , where a is 15 50 by weight of methyl methacrylate, 15 70 by weight of 2 ethylhexyl acrylate, n butyl acrylate or n octyl acrylate, 5 15 by weight of N vinyl 2 pyrrolidone and 0 25 by weight of 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate.The Inert DiluentThe inert diluent present during polymerization can be any organic liquid which will clearly dissolve in the monomer mixture. However, it need not be a solvent for the polymer and can vary in its solvent power from a thermodynamically good solvent for monomers and polymers to a thermodynamically poor solvent for the polymer.Inert diluents which are thermodynamically good solvents for the monomers, but poor solvents for the copolymer are commonly used in the preparation of macroporous ion exchange resins which are copolymers of styrene and divinylbenzene. The preparation of macroporous hydrogels according to the same principle is described in DDR 66283 and U.S. 4,184,020. In all cases the objective was to prepare macroporous hydrogels for gel chromatography or gas chromatography, and none have been used in oral drug delivery applications. This is understandable since due to their high hydrophilicity the release rate would be impractically fast.The use of inert diluents which are thermodynamically good solvents for both the monomers and the resulting copolymers, results in microporous polymers of increased distances between crosslinks expanded gel structure comparable to the microporous, homogeneous structure of polymers prepared in absence of such diluents.A preferred embodiment of the instant invention pertains to compositions prepared with the use of inert diluents which are good solvents for the monomers and which vary from good to poor in solvent power for the copolymers. Thus copolymer with a selected range of microporous to macroporous structures can be prepared by choosing the diluent used. The structure desired in turn is dictated by the solubility characteristics of the drug to be imbibed as well as its dose size.If the diluent is a good solvent for the polymer, the product is obtained with a network structure which is a microreticular, that is microporous, in nature. This structure is comparable to the one obtained in the absence of solvent when the polymerization is carried out in bulk, but differs from it by a more extended and open network structure as a result of the good solvent present. If, on the other hand, the diluent is only a solvent for the monomer, but is a non solvent or precipitant for the polymer, the product is obtained with a macroporous or macroreticular structure which is 2 phase gas polymer in nature. Although the extremes of both possibilities can be well distinguished from each other, interme diate grades of micro and macroreticular polymers form a continuum between them. The solvent power and the solubility parameter of the diluent are commonly a function of its chemical nature, like the degree of hydrogen bonding, polar and non polar interactions, presence of hetero atoms and, generally, of the degree of similarity of the diluent to the monomer which is used. The effect of phase separation during polymerization in the presence of an inert diluent is enhanced by an increase in crosslink density. To choose the right diluents and the right amount of crosslinking agent to get a microor macroreticular structure is a task easily performed by anyone skilled in the art of polymer chemistry and especially the art of making ion exchange resins.Another group of diluents which are very poor solvents for the polymer formed are other polymers. It is well known that two different polymers will essentially not dissolve in each other due to the extremely low heat of mixing. Therefore, while polymeric diluents can dissolve in the monomer mixture, during polymerization phase separation between both polymers occurs. After extraction of the inert polymeric diluent, a product is obtained with an extended network structure which is likely to be more macroreticular than microreticular in nature. Such polymeric diluents, like poly alkylene ether glycols or polyesters are especially preferred in the context of this invention. Useful low molecular weight diluents are ester such as ethyl acetate butyl cellosolve acetate butyl acetate isobutyl acetate methyl cellosolve acetates ethers, such as methyl phenyl ether tetrahydrofuran alcohols, such as ethanol isopropanol n , isoand tert butanol lauryl alcohol octanol decanol dodecanol butyl cellosole ethyl cellosolve butyl alcohol cyclohexanol. Ketones, such as methyl ethyl ketone methyl iso butyl ketone amides, such as dimethylformamide formamide acetamide dimethylacetamide.Dimethyl sulfoxide. Sulfolane. N methyl 2 pyrrolidone. Also useful are hydrocarbons such as hexane, heptane, cyclohexane or halogenated hydrocarbons like tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethane or trichloroethylene. Preferred inert diluents are polyalkylene ether glycols, such as polyethylene oxide glycol, polypropylene oxide glycol and poly nbutyleneoxide glycol, and block copolymers thereof, octanol, decanol, dodecanol, heptane, or isobutyl acetate.The Active IngredientAny agricultural chemical or active ingredient used to obtain a selected physiological or biological response in the broadest agricultural context can be incorporated as the active ingredient in the copolymeric carrier of this invention. Active agricultural ingredient is used in that broadest sense as including any composition of matter that will produce the desired agricultural response. Suitable mixtures of such agricultural chemicals or ingredients can be used with equal facility as single component systems.The amount of agricultural chemical incorporated in the carrier varies widely depending on the particular chemical, the desired agricultural effect, and the time span for which it takes the chemical to be released.On contact of the instant compositions with water or an aqueous environment, the controlled release of the agricultural chemical occurs. This can be taken advantage of in applying pesticides to the soil. For example, the entrapped pesticide can be applied in the dry form to the top of the soil or it can be embedded in the soil and will be released as a result of rain or artificial watering.Usually 0.1 to 3.5 of the active material is employed based on the weight of the crosslinked copolymer.The agricultural chemicals can include pesticides including bactericides, fungicides, insecticides and nematocides, herbicides or fertilizers.

nitrosalicylanilide, Synthesis of the CopolymerThe copolymers of this invention are synthesized by free radical initiate d polymerization, using either redox catalysts, peroxy compounds or azo compounds typical initiators include lauroyl peroxide, tert. butyl peroctoste and azo bisisobutyronitrile. As known to those skilled in the art, many different peroxy and azo compounds are commercially available and can be used.Free radical polymerization can also be W initiated in the presence of commonly used UV initiators and sensitizers such as benzophenone, benzoin, diethyoxyacetophenone DEAP and related compounds. Electron beam radiation can be used if the polymer are made in form of films, coating or sheets. The polymers are synthesized in form of beads by suspension polymerization process in an aqueous medium. To reduce the solubility of water soluble comonomers present, the medium is preferably an inorganic salt solution, usually concentrated sodium chloride solution. As suspending agents can be used either polymeric suspending agents such as poly vinyl pyrrolidone , polyvinyl alcohol or poly hydroxyethyl cellulose , or inorganic, insoluble salts such as calcium phosphate, calcium oxalate, calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate or magnesium phosphate, or the insoluble hydroxides such asMg OH 2, A1 OH 3 or Ti OH 4. A process which can be used to make the polymers of this invention in form of beads is described inU.S. 4,224,427.After synthesis the polymer beads are thoroughly extracted with ethanol or ethanol water mixtures or other suitable solvents and dried to constant weight. The polymers of this invention can also be manufactured by bulk polymerization methods in form of sheets, films or shapes.In form of shapes, rods, films or sheets and coatings the instant copolymer can also be made by casting and thermally or UV initiated polymerization.The polymers after synthesis are characterized by their degree of swelling in water and ethanol, by their ability to imbibe an active ingredient and the release of this ingredient into an aqueous environment, as described in detail in the examples.Preparation of the Active Ingredient Containing CompositionAfter drying, the polymer beads are imbibed with a chosen active ingredient. As solvent for imbibing the ingredient, any solvent which will a dissolve the ingredient, b swell the polymers, and c can be quantitatively removed can be used. These are preferably low boiling solvents like methanol or ethanol, methylene chloride, acetone or mixtures of such solvents. Aqueous alcoholic solutions are also suitable. The best choice of solvents will depend on the solubility of the ingredient and on the desired level of loading. In general, however, it is seen, that for many water soluble ingredients, ethanol is also a good solvent and the high ethanol swelling capability of the polymers of this invention makes high ingredient loadings from ethanol solutions possible and preferred.Especially high loading are obtained with certain ingredients when the polymer synthesis is carried out in presence of an inert diluent.To load the copolymer with an active ingredient, the copolymer is equilibrated in a solution of said active ingredient in ethanol, methanol or other organic solvent or a mixture of such solvents which may also contain water. Subsequently the solvent is driven off by drying in heat or vacuo.It has further been discovered that especially high ingredientloadings can be achieved if the polymerization is carried out in presence of an inert diluent which results in a final polymer of increased pore size and which copolymer therefore is capable of absorbing even higher amounts of solvent and ingredient.Ingredient loaded compositions, in which the polymer is obtained in the presence of such inert diluents as poly propylene glycol , decanol or dodecanol are thus a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Despite high ingredient loadings, beads treated in this manner show a prolonged and delayed release.Agricultural chemical loaded polymers having 30 70 of their total hydrophobic monomer composition derived from C4 C21 alkyl substituted monomers are an especially preferred embodiment of this invention.It has furthermore been found unexpectedly that use of polymeric inert diluents during the synthesis of the polymer beads of the instant invention gave after extraction beads with a specifically modified network structure which resulted in unexpectedly good ingredient release characteristics, especially the elimination of excessive tailing.The polymers of this invention are exceptionally well suited as agricultural chemical carriers when their gel structure is expanded by use of an inert diluent during synthesis, and contain at least 25 by weight of residues derived from a monomer which is an alkyl acrylate and or alkyl methacrylate having 4 to 10 carbon atoms in the alkyl group.In the following examples the degrees of swelling in water or ethanol are expressed as percent of water or of ethanol in the swollen polymer, namely weight of weight ofDS in s swollen polymer dry polymer X 100 water or ethanol weight of swollen polymerThe swelling ratio for a polymer is defined as the ratio ethanol water. In the following examples MAC refers to a difunctional crosslinking agent obtained by reaction of 2 mols isophorone diisocyanate with 1 mol poly n butyleneoxide diol of 2000 averagemolecular weight, followed by end capping with 2 moles 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate.The following abbreviations are used HEMA 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylateNVP N vinyl 2 pyrrolidoneMMA methyl methacrylateEHA 2 ethylhexyl acrylateBA butyl acrylate t OCT tert . octylmethacrylamide 1,1,3, 3 tetramethylbutylmethacrylamide DMA dimethylacrylamideMAC macromer B as prepared in Example 1GMA glycidyl methacrylateExample 1 Synthesis of Polymer Beads by Suspension PolymerizationA smooth wall, 1,000 ml resin flask is equipped with a reflux condenser, nitrogen inlet tube, thermometer attached to a thermoregulator, baffle and anchor type stirrer driven by a variable speed motor. A slow flow of nitrogen is maintained through the reaction flask at all times.To the flask are charged 360 grams of 20 by weight aqueous sodium chloride solution followed by 12.5 grams 0.0615 moles , of magnesium chloride hexahydrate. The solution is heated slowly to 80 with rapid stirring. To this solution is then added dropwise 123 ml 0.123 moles of a l normal sodium hydroxide solution to form a fine, gelatinous precipitate of magnesium hydroxide in the reaction flask.After all the sodium hydroxide is added, the stirring speed is reduced to 100 rpm and a mixture of 42 g 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate, 110 g methyl methacrylate and 24 g N vinylpyrolidone and 24 g macromer b containing dissolved therein 0.2 gram of tert butyl peroctoate as a free radical polymerization initiator is added. The macromer b is prepared by dissolving 60 grams ca. 0.024 moles of a poly tetramethylene oxide glycol average molecular weight of 2,000 endcapped with isophorone diisocyanate t 3 isocyanstomethyl 3,5,5 trimethylcyclohexyl isocyanate in 40 grams 0.31 moles of 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate HEMA and allowing said mixture to react for 72 hours at room temperature.AT the end of this period the disappearance of the terminal isocyanate groups is verified by noting the sbsence of the characteristic infrared spectral band at 2270 cm 1 associated with the NCO group.3 The reaction mixture is stirred under nitrogen at 100 rpm and at 75 C for three hours. The temperature is then raised to 100 C for 1 hour after which time the flask is cooled to room temperature.10 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid are then added to dissolve the magnesium hydroxide suspending agent. The reaction mixture is then filtered through fine cheesecloth. The isolated product beads are washed with 2,000 ml of water and soaked overnight in 500 ml of ethanol to extract any residual monomer. The beads are then isolated by filtration through a polyester cloth bag, which is then sewn closed, and dried in a home clothes dryer. Uniform spherical beads are obtained in a yield of 184 g 92.7 which have an average diameter of 0.98 mm and exhibit a percent swelling in water of 16 and in ethanol of 38 .

Since the amount of hydrophilic monomer 48 by weight of total monomers in the copolymers of each of these examples exceeded the upper allowable amount of hydrophilic monomer in the instant invention, the resulting copolymers accordingly absorbed more water over 20 by weight in the swollen state than desired for the copolymers of the instant invention.Nonetheless, the influence of increasing chain length in the hydrophobic monomer on increasing the swelling ratio of the copolymers in ethanol water is clearly seen.The following examples show that the ethanol swelling properties of polymers containing no hydrophobic comonomer low ethanol water ratio are inferior to those of polymers of this invention which contain a hydrophobic comonomer component. Examples 29 36 Following the general procedure of Example 1, copolymer beads codntaining no hydrophobic comonomer are synthesized and their percent swelling in ethanol and water determined. As the table shows, when ethanol swelling is over 50 , water swelling is also very high and the swelling ratio is low. This is in contrast to the polymers of Examples 1 12.

A slow flow of nitrogen is maintained through the reaction flask at all times.To the flask are charged 360 grams of a 20 by weight aqueous sodium chloride solution followed by 12.5 grams 0.0615 moles , of magnesium chloride hexahydrate.

The macromer b is prepared as described in Example 1. The reaction mixture is stirred under nitrogen at 100 rpm and a 750C for three hours. The temperature is then raised to 1000C for 1 hour after which time the flask is cooled to room temperature.10 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid are then added to dissolve the magnesium hydroxide suspending agent. The reaction mixture is then filtered through the cheesecloth. The isolated product beads are washed with 2,000 ml of water and soaked overnight in 500 ml of ethanol to extract any residual monomer and then extracted in a soxhlet with refluxing ethanol.
