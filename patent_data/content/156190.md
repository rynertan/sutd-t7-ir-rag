## Description
8ANTI CLOGGING DEVICE FOR THE SUBMERGED SUCKING PIPE INTHE FUEL TANK OF DIESEL ENGINES It is known that during the winter season a serious icon lenience affects diesel engines consisting of the formation within the fuel tank of clots of heavy components, in particular paraffin wax, and in the not unlikely instance of water being present, of ice as well, which tend to clog up the strainer at the bottom of the submerged sucking pipe which takes the fuel from the tank by means of the fuel puup to the injection pump and then to the fuel inJectors consequential to the clogging up of the strainer is that, as may be easily understood, the engine stops owing to lack of fuel. The problem, which is specially felt with trucks which are often parked outdoors overnight and the fuel tank whereof is exposed and much affected by weather, is all the more serious when it is considered that the engine stops after the vehicle has travelled some distance, thereby the user is placed in a particular ly difficult situation, because it is the suction of fuel taking place in the submerged sucking pipe that makes the clots formed and scattered within the mass of fuel converge into the strainer and clog it up. In order to remedy this drawback additives have been proposed for pouring into the fuel, which, however, are little used owing mainly to their encessively high cost. It is the aim of this invention to provide an anti S gging device for the submerged sucking pipe which is of the utmost simplicity, so as to ensure a limited cost and highly reliable operation, and has virtually no running costs. Within the propo8ed aim it is an object of the invention to provide an anti clogging device for the sub merged swoking pipe, which can be easily installed in any motor vehicle.A not beast obJect of the invention is to provide an anti clogging device which prevents any contamination of the fuel.The proposed aim and outlined objects are achieved by an anti clogging device for the submerged sucking pipe of diesel engine fuel tanks, according to the invention, to which tank there is led a return line tube from the injectors adapted to convey excess fuel supplied to the same, characterized by the presence of means of heating said excess fuel within the return line tube, which is made to reach the interior of the tank substantially at a filter located at the end of the submerged sucking pipe.Advantageously the means of heating the fuel contained in the return line tube to the tank comprises a heat exchanger wherein the heating fluid is water from the cooling system of the engine.Further features and advantages will be apparent from the description of a preferred, but not exclusive, embodiment of the invention, shown by way of example and not of limitation in the accompanying drawings the one figure whereof is a schematic view of the invention.With reference to the aforesaid figure indicated at 1 is the fuel tank, and indicated at 2 is the filter located at the end of the submerged sacking pipe 3, wherethrough the fuel, in flowing in the direction of the arrow Fowl, reaches a series of members, not shown in the figure, comprising in succession a hel pump, a filter, and an injection pump which supplies it to the injectors whence there extends a return line tube to the tank 7 of the excess fuel which is indicated at 4 and which also collects excess fuel supplied by the injection pump, whilst the arrow FC2 shows the flow direction of the fuel in said tube 4.On said return line tube 4 there is provided the threeway cock 5 which admits selectively the fuel into the heat exchanger generally indicated at 6 which will be described in detail herein below, and this occurs during the winter season, and into the bypass 7 during the summer season said exchanger and bypass converge then into the final portion 4a which conveys the fuel in the direction of the arrow contained therein into the tank 1 at the filter 2 at the end of the submerged sucking pipe.In the heat exchanger 6 the fuel is conveyed into the coil pipe 8, which forms in practice the extension of the tube 4 after the cock 5, which is wound on the periphery of the conduit 9 which receives the heating fluid formed of the water from the cooling circuit of the motor through the branching 9a to discharge it through 9b, and is wrapped by the coil pipe 10 which also conveys hot water oncoming through the branching IOa and discharged through lOb the arrows F1 and F2 point out the flow direction of the water.As is readily gathered from the complete description, the invention shows great constructional simplicity and may be easily installed on any motor vehicle further, the heating of the fuel accomplished at the expense of the heat, which would be otherwise wasted, from the engine cooling system affords operation without any energy consumption.It is then important to consider the fact that, by realizing the heat exchanger such that the two fluids are separated by two walls, breaking of one wall would merely result in the loss of the fluid contained therein, and this loss is at once detected by the user who can remedy it, while no mutual contamination of the two fluids occurs.Actual tests have, moreover, allowed to ascertain that the installation of the device according to the invention has beneficial effects on the engine performance. The invention herein is susceptible to many modifications and variations, all of which fall swithin the scope of the inventive concept thus, heating of the fuel contained in the return line tube may be achieved with different means from those described, each as, for example an electric resistor powered from the motor vehicle battery and contained in a fluid vessel at the periphery of the return line tube, and the entrance of said tube into the tank may also take place with a different procedure from that shown, providing that it is always close to the filter 2.In practicing the invention all of the details maw be replaced with other technically equivalent elements furthermore, materials used, as wefl as the shapes and dimension may be any ones.
