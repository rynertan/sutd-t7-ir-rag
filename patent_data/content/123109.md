# COMPUTER SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PAGE COMPOSING

## Abstract
Machine implemented text graphics formatting is based upon a logical page area on a presentation receiving medium, such as a CRT face, sheet of paper and the like. named text and graphics receiving areas 222, 225, 233, 234, 236 are selec tively assignable to the logical pages 65 of a document being formatted for visual presentation and are addressable and formattable independent of other formatting in any logical page. The named areas are machine defined such that one area can have portions thereof automatically assigned to and presented with any arbitrary number of logical pages. Such areas are managed in a text formatting machine to facilitate formatting headers based upon text contained in a succession of logical pages that are outside the named area. A first class of such named areas is placed upon the page when formatting to the page is ended, while a second class of such named areas is placed on the page in response to a command. The placement of the second class on a page can result in starting formatting new pages. Bleed tabs, annotations, and other typographic niceties are machine formattable using such named areas.
