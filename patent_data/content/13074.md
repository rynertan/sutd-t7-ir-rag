# A variable ratio rack and pinion gear.

## Abstract
A variable ratio rack and pinion gear having a rack bar 1 the rack 8 of which engages with the pinion 10 so that rotation of the pinion 10 displaces the rack member 1 lon gitudinally relative to the housing 6 . A yoke 25 supports the member 1 with its teeth in engagement with the pinion 10 and straddles the member 1 to restrain displacement of that membmer 1 relative to the housing 6 in a direction parallel to the axis of rotation for the pinion 10 . The rack member 1 has a longitudinally extending non rectilinear grooved track 14 which is engaged by a peg 17 rotatably carried in a mounting block 21 . The block 21 retains the yoke 25 in the housing 6 with the peg 17 located within and extending through the yoke 25 . The peg 17 engages with the track 14 so that during longitudinal displacement of the rack member 1 the reaction between the groove 14 and peg 17 imparts controlled rotation to the member 1 to vary the ratio of the gear.
