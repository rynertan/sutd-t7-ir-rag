# A method and apparatus for making tubular containers, at least substantially closed at one end, from pipe material by cold working.

## Abstract
A process and an apparatus for manufacturing tubular cartridges having one end at least substantially closed, by means of cold working of tubular blanks, wherein a tubular blank 8 is fed into a die 1 snugly enclosing said blank 8 , the tube end to be closed resting on a retractable bottom form ing tool 4 . With the tube 8 so positioned a punch 3 having an outer diameter larger than the inner diameter of the tube 8 is lowered into the tube 8 , which punch 3 when moving through the tube 8 displaces material 17 from the entire length of the inner wall of the tube 8 to the lower end of the tube 8 so as to at least partially close this end of the tube 8 .
