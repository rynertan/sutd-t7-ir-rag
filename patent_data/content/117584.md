# Device for producing and projecting light.

## Abstract
The device for producing and projecting light has a re flector 11 with an optical centre 12 , a short arc discharge lamp 13 with lamp caps 21, 22 provided with pins 23 and 24, respectively and a lamp holder 14 in which the pin 24 of the lamp cap 22 is fixed by fixing screws 26 . The lamp holder 14 has a tube 25 which accommodates the pin 24 which is provided with a longitudinal gap 27 , in whose proximity and on either side of which is arranged a respec tive radially directed fixing screw 26 . The gap 27 merges into a transverse gap 28 which covers approximately half the circumference of the tube 25 . Due to the gaps 27, 28 , the tube 25 has obtained parts which behave like rigid springs and keep the fixing screws 26 pressed on the pin 24 .
