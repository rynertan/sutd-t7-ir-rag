# Dual end resonant slot array antenna feed.

## Abstract
An antenna with a dual end resonant slot array feed improves the bandwidth performance of a resonant slotted waveguide planar array antenna. The dual end resonant slot array feed includes a tee junction 28 which may be either an E plane or H plane, two waveguide sections 32, 34 , and two E plane waveguide bends 36, 38 . The two waveguide sections 32, 34 are formed by a septum 40 mounted in a slotted waveguide 42 for separating the input tee junction 28 , from the slots 44 of the slotted waveguide. The ends of the septum 40 coacting with the ends of the waveguide to form the E plane waveguide bends 36, 38 . Thus, resonant feeding of the series slot waveguides 50 is achieved by the opposing traveling waves thereby eliminating the need to use resonant short circuits, cavities, or folded short circuits. Further direct coupling to the series slots 44 directly adjacent to the E or H plane feed point 50 is avoided by introducing the septum 40 between the feed point 50 and the row of slots 44 .

## Claims
1. An antenna comprising a resonant slotted waveguide section and a dual end resonant slot array feed operatively connected to the slotted waveguide section for feeding rf energy from both ends of the slotted waveguide to the slots thereof.

## Description
This invention relates to slotted array antennas and more paricularly to a dual end resonant slot array feed for a resonant slotted waveguide planar array antenna. In the past slotted array antennae have been fed by single end feed mechanisms. When a waveguide section is fed at one end a waveguide short at the opposite end sets up a standing wave in the waveguide. Shunt or series slot elements are located at appropriate points on the standing wave pattern voltage or current peaks, respectively to cause radiation with the correct amplitude and phase. Over a band of frequencies, the standing wave pattern in the waveguide varies relative to the location of the slots, causing errors in the slot amplitudes and phases. The magnitude of these errors increases in a direct relationship to the deviation of frequency from the design center frequency. The magnitude of the errors also increases with the length of the waveguide, and hence the number of slots. For waveguides having four or more slots, the usable bandwidth of a single end feed is on the order of 1 percent. To improve the bandwidth relative to a single end feed, E plane and H plane tee feeds have been used. The E plane tee feed is in essence, two single end feeds joined at their respective feed points by an E plane waveguide tee improvement is caused by reducing the length and number of slots associated with each of the two single end feeds. The problem with the E plane feed is that in order to maintain equal slot spacing one slot must lie directly under the E plane tee. Owing to mutual coupling to the E plane tee, this slot suffers a variation in phase and amplitude over the frequency band which differs significantly from the other slots in the array. This significantly different set of phase amplitude errors for the slot under the E plane feed largely offsets any bandwidth advantages that otherwise would have been obtained by using the E plane tee. By substituting an H plane shunt tee for the E plane series tee, the feed point for the slot waveguide can be located half way between two slots instead of directly over the slots. Nevertheless, as the H plane feed must be about one half wavelength wide to avoid waveguide cutoff effects , the feed then couples to the two slots adjacent to the feed, yielding essential the same bandwidth limitations as the E plane feed. For a large array antenna, the bandwidth typically has been limited to less than 2.5 using one of the above methods owing to the need to keep the manifold complexity within reasonable bounds. Both the amplitude and phase of the aperture illumination begin to be significantly degraded at 1 of the center frequency. The single end feed for a resonant waveguide array is described in a number of texts on antennas. Those persons skilled in the art desiring more detailed information pertaining to single end feeds are referred to Johnson and Jasik s Antenna Engineering Handbook, Second Edition, 1984 1961, Chapter 9. Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide a slotted array antenna having substantially increased frequency bandwidth. Another object of the invention is to provide a feed for improving substantially the bandwidth performance of the slot array over that obtained using a single end feed. Yet another object of the invention is to improve substantially the amplitude and phase accuracy of the aperture illumination of the slot array antenna. Briefly stated the invention comprises a dual end resonant slot array feed applicable to either a series slot feed or a shunt slot feed. A resonant waveguide section that contains either shunt or series slots spaced one half guide wavelength is fed or excited from both ends. Other objects and features of the invention will become more readily apparent from the following detailed description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which Referring now to Figure 1, a planar slotted array antenna 10 comprises a polarizer 12, a longitudinal shunt slotted plate 14, a rotational series slotted plate 16, and manifold 18. The series waveguide excites a row of series slots 17 which couple RF power into the shunt waveguides. The series waveguides are not visable in this Figure, as they are located on the back side of 16. The shunt waveguide excites the shunt slots, which are the radiating elements. All of the slots are spaced one half waveguide wavelength λ One form of a prior art waveguide feed system for the series slots is shwon in Figure 2a. Each of the series slot waveguides 24 is fed at one end by a fed manifold 18. A waveguide short circuiting wall 23 at the opposite end of the waveguide sets up the standing wave needed for proper excitation of the series slots. In certain applications, variable phase shifters 22 may be added to electronically scan the antenna s radiation pattern. In another form of the prior art, the series slots are fed as shown in Figure 2b. Here an E plane waveguide tee 100 divides RF energy between two series slot waveguides 102 and 104, through E plane tees 114 and 116. Waveguide shorts 106 at the outer ends of waveguides 102 and 104 set up the appropriate standing waves so that the series slots 108, 110, 112 etc., couple energy to the front face of the antenna. For a proper standing wave, the waveguide short 106 must be one half wavelength from the end slot in the waveguide, as shown. Similar λ 2 waveguide shorts are needed at the opposite ends of both waveguides 102 and 104, but only one quarter wavelength on space is available for each of these shorts since a constant series slot spacing of λ Slots 110 and 112, being located directly under the E plane tees 114 and 116, respectively, exhibit direct coupling effects to the tee, which results in phase and amplitude errors for these slots. These slots thus become another bandwidth limiting element in the antenna. Referring now to Figures 3a and 3b, the dual end series slot feed 26 includes a tee junction which may be either an E plane tee junction 28 Fig. 3a or an H plane tee junction 30 Fig. 3b , two waveguide sections 32 and 34, and two E plane waveguide bends 36 and 38. The two waveguide section 32 and 34 and the E plane bends are formed by a septum 40. The septum 40 is placed across waveguide 42 to separate all n slots 44 from the tee junction. The two E plane waveguide bends 36 and 38 are formed by the space between ends 46 and 48 of the septum 40 and the ends of the waveguide 42 which space interconnects the two waveguide sections 32 and 34. The thickness of the septum 40 is much less than the wavelength in order to minimize the antenna thickness. The total length of the waveguide loop is approximately equal to nλ It will be appreciated from the foregoing description that a typical design of the dual end slot array feed is based on the following rules The improved performance of the dual end feed is demonstrated by theoretical analysis of a waveguide with 8 series slots using ideal H plane tee junction and E plane waveguide bends. The slots are identical and their normalized resistances are equal to 0.25. The radiation current distribution compared to the ideal current is shown in Figures 5a and 5b, and are computed for 1.8 off the center frequency. The set of symmetrical curves are computed for the tee junction at the center while the unsymmetrical results are computed for the tee junction at a half guide wavelength off from the center. It is to be noted that the radiation current amplitude and phase variations are only 0.16 dB and 9.5 degrees, respectively, for the symmetrical feed over a 3.6 bandwidth. These variations in radiation current distribution increases to 0.44 dB and 13 degrees when the tee junction is offset by λ A comparison of the single end and dual end feed theoretical performances for the 8 slot array is shown in Table 1. These results are computed for 3.6 bandwidth. Obviously, the dual end feed provides an improvement in bandwidth performance as compared to the single end feed. A dual end series slot feed was fabricated using the E plane waveguide bend of Figure 4a and the H plane tee junction of Figure 4b. A 16.5 GHz center frequency waveguide section with 5 unequal slots was employed. The dimensions of the waveguide 42 Fig. 4a were 0.496 by 0.155 . For the E plane waveguide bend, the thickness t of the septum 40 was 0.032 , and the space W was 0.177 . For the H plane tee junction Fig. 4b the input 50 was 0.496 wide, with a tuning stub 0.025 high and a 0.138 diameter positioned 0.637 from the end of waveguide section 32. Waveguide section 32 has a width of 0.496 and a T shaped matching vane 54 centered with respect to the input 50. The T has a length of 0.222 and a thickness of 0.030 . Tests showed that the VSWR of the E plane waveguide bends is less that 1.10 over a 6 bandwidth, and the input VSWR of the H plane tee junction is less than 1.18 over the same bandwidth. The measured output voltage amplitude and phase from the slots are shown in Figures 6a and 6b. The slot output voltages are measured from a set of identical waveguides in which the RF power is coupled through the series slots. It will be noted from Figure 6a that the measured voltage amplitudes are consistently evenly distributed over a wide bandwidth. The length of slot 2 is slightly too short owing to fabrication errors such that the amplitude falls off at the low frequency. The phase plot Fig. 6b was obtained by normalizing to the phase of slot 3, i.e., the phase of slot 3 0. All the phases track very well except the first slot. However, the largest discrepancy at 16.0 GHz over a 6 bandwidth is only 17 degrees. Two dual end slot array feeds 42 Fig. 7 having different number of slots 44 in their arrays of slots n1 and n2 where n1 n2 can have their tee junctions 50 connected to waveguide sections 56 and 58. Waveguide sections 56 and 58 are connected to a power divider 60 of manifold 18. Between the two arrays of n1 and n2 series slots where n1 n2, a waveguide length equal to n1 n2 λ Although only a single embodiment of the invention has been described, it will be apparent to a person skilled in the art that various modifications to the details of construction shown and described may be made without departing from the scope of this invention. For example, while most of the descriptions have addressed the feeding of series slot elements in the broad wall of a rectangular waveguide, the method is equally applicable to both shunt and series slots in waveguides of arbitray cross section. Also, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that this antenna will operate reciprocally, having the same characteristics whether transmitting or receiving, despite the fact that the antenna has been described above primarily as a transmitting antenna.
