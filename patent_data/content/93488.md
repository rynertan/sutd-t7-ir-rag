There are further groups and sub groups of compounds within formula I corresponding to those of formulae IV to Xj respectively wherein r is 2 and the remaining variables are as defined therein. It will of course be realised that the compounds of the formula I have chiral or prochiral centres, and thus are capable of existing in a number of stereoisomeric forms.The invention extends to each of these stereoisoneric forms, and to mixtures thereof including racemates . The different stereoisomeric forms may be separated one from the other by the usual methods, or any given isomer may be obtained by stereospecific or asymmetric synthesis. The invention also provides a process for the preparation of a compound of the formula I , which process comprises reacting an acid derivative of the formula XI EMI14.1 wherein X is H and Y is H or X and Y together form an oxo group Q1 and Q2 are independently leaving groups or together are 0 s is O or 1 and the remaining variables are as in formula I , with a compound of formula XII EMI14.2 wherein the variables are as defined in formula I and thereafter as necessary reducing X and Y when an oxo group to X and Y both hydrogen and if desired or necessary converting a group R2 or R3 in the thus formed compound to another group R2 or R3 respectively converting R4 when hydrogen to another R4 and optionally forming a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the resultant compound of the formula I . The leaving groups Q1 and Q2 are groups readily displaceable by a nucleophile. Suitable values for Q1 andQ2 include halogen, such as chloro or bromo carboxylic acyloxy, such as C14 alkanoyloxy and hydroxy they may also together be 0. Suitable values for Q1, and for Q2 when X and Y together are an oxo group also include activated hydrocarbyloxy, such as pentachlorophenoxy. Suitable values for Q2 when X and Y are each hydrogen include labile acyloxy such as mesyloxy, tosyloxy, or triflate.a When X and Y together are an oxo group, Q1 and Q2 may each independently be halogen, carboxylic acyloxy, hydroxy or activated hydrocarbyloxy or together may be 0, to form an active acylating derivative of phthalic acid. Q1 andQ2 will often be the same. The reaction will normally be carried out in an inert solvent, such as benzene, toluene, THF or DMF. These reactions may be carried out at any non extreme temperature such as 200 1000C and more suitably 300 800C. The higher reaction temperatures are employed with less active acid derivatives of the formula XIj whereas the lower temperatures are employed with the more reactive acid derivatives of the formula XI . When Q1 and Q2 are halogen or carboxylic acyloxy, the reaction will preferably be in the presenoe of an acid acceptor. The acid acceptor is suitably an organic base such as a tertiary amine e.g. triethylamine, trimethylamine, pyridine or picoline, or an inorganic acid acceptor, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonateIt should also be noted that it is possible to use certain acid acceptors as the inert solvent, for example organic bases. Q1 and Q2 may also each be hydroxyl and reaction is then effected by reacting the acid XIV and the compound XII in the presence of a dehydrating catalyst such as a carbodiimide, for example dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. The subsequent reduction of the product is preferably carried out, with or without isolation of the product, with tin hydrochloric acid at elevated temperature. Compounds of the formula XI in this case are known compounds or prepared by analogy with known compounds.b When X and Y are each H, Q1 may be any of the functions listed above. Suitable Q2 then include halogen, hydroxy and labile acyloxy or Q1 and Q2 may together be 0. For Q1 and Q2 other than together being 0, suitable reaction conditions are as for corresponding functions in a above. Q2 is preferably halogen or labile acyloxy. Q1 and Q2 will often both be the same halogen. The intermediate of formula XI wherein s O in this case can be prepared by known methods, such as for example reacting a compound of the formula XIII EMI16.1 wherein the variables are as defined in formula XI with a halogenating agent for electron deficient methyl such as N bromosuccinimide, chlorine or bromine, for Q2 halo base hydrolysing the product for Q2 hydroxyl and acylating the hydroxyl compound for Q2 labile acyloxy. Compounds of the formula XIII are known or prepared by analogy with known compounds. When Q1 and Q2 together are 0, the reaction is preferably carried out by heating a mixture of the reactants in an inert solvent in a sealed vessel. Compounds of the formula XII are known compounds or can be prepared by analogy to known compounds. It will be realised that in the compound of the formula I the cyclic amide linkage may have an a or ss orientation with respect to the ring of the bicyclic moiety to which it is attached. A mixture of a and b isomers of the compound of the formula I may be synthesised non stereospecifically and the desired isomer separated conventionally therefrom, e.g. by chromatography or alternatively the a or ss isomer may if desired be synthesised from the correspondingaor ss form of the compound of the formula XII Synthesis from the corresponding a or ss isomer of compound of the formula XII is in general preferred. The a or ss form of the compound of the formula XII may if desired be prepared by known stereospecific processes, such as those leading to the a or ss isomers of the compound of the formula XII depicted in Scheme 1. The precursor of the compound of the formula XII may be stereospecifically synthesised, such as the azide depicted in Scheme 1, and then converted to the corresponding desired isomer of the compound of the formula XII under non stereospecific conditions with retention of configuration. Alternatively, the precursor may itself have no asymmetric or prochiral centre at the relevant position, but be converted under stereospecific conditions to the desired isomer of the compound of the formula XII . Alternatively, a mixture of the a and ss isomers of the compound of the formula XII may be synthesised nonstereospecifically and the desired isomer separated conventionally therefrom e.g. by chromatography. However, in this case it is generally more convenient to react the mixture to give a mixture of a and ss isomers of the compound of the formula I and to separate these if desired as hereinbefore described. The following Scheme 1 illustrates stereospecific and non stereospecific synthetic routes to intermediates of the formula XII . Scheme 1EMI19.1 axial axial, equatorial XII XII Remainder of ring system omitted for clarity The skilled man will appreciate that the choice or necessity of conversion of groups R2 and or R3 to other groups R2 and or R3 will be dictated by the nature and position of substituents R1, R2 and R3. It will be apparent that compounds of the formula I containing an R2, R3 or R4 group which is convertible to another R2, R3 or R4 group are useful intermediates, and as such form an important aspect of the invention. By way of example of such conversions, the compounds of the formula I wherein R2 and or R3 is a nitro group meta to the carbonyl function and may be prepared via the nitration of the corresponding intermediate product whereinR2 and or R3 is a hydrogen atom Also the reduction of the intermediates wherein R2 or R3 is a nitro group to R2 R3 amino may be effected with reagents known to be suitable for reducting nitroarenes to aminoarenes. Those compounds of the invention wherein R2 or R3 is a C17 acylamino group may be prepared from the corresponding intermediate wherein R2 or R3 is an amino group by reaction with an acylating derivative, such as previously described as a suitable acylating derivative, e.g. of the acid of the formula XIV . The reaction may proceed as described for the reaction of the compounds of the formula XIV and XV . For an R2 R3 formamido group acylation may be effecte d with the free acid. This invention thus also provides an optional process I wherein R2 or R3 is an amino group which process comprises the deacylation of a corresponding intermediate wherein R2 or R3 is a C17 acylamino group. Generally the hydrolysis reaction may be effected by treatment with a base such as an alkali metal hydroxide. Also a compound of the formula I wherein R2 or R3 is halogen may be prepared by a conventional halogenation of the corresponding intermediate wherein the said R2 orR3 is hydrogen. Similarly the compounds wherein R2 or R3 is C16 alkylthio or C 1 6 alkylsulphinyl may be oxidised to the corresponding compounds wherein R2 or R3 is C16 alkylsulphinyl or C 1 6 alkylsulphonyl respectively. These oxidations may conveniently be carried out conventionally at below ambient temperatures using an organic peracid in a non aqueous inert reaction medium preferably a chlorinated hydrocarbon solvent, for example using 3 chloroperbenzoic acid, or using a water soluble inorganic strong oxidant, such as an alkali metal permanganate or hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution. It will be appreciated by the skilled man that, depending on the other specific substituents in the compound of the formula I , such an oxidation on a compound of the formula I may also form the N oxide of the bicyclic moiety therein. Given the specific substitution desired and it having been decided whether the compound or its N oxide is required, the skilled man wil readly ascertain whether such R2 R3 interconversion is desirable. In general it is preferred to effect the oxidation in the intermediate of formula XIV before coupling. It will be appreciated that, when R4 in the compound of the formula I is optionally substituted benzyl as hereinbefore defined, R4 may be replaced by another groupR4. Such benzyl groups may be removed for example whenR2 or R3 is not halogen by conventional transition metal catalysed hydrogenolysis to give compounds of the formula XIV EMI22.1 which may then be reacted with compound Q3R4 wherein R4 is as defined in formula I and O3 is a group or atom readily displaced by a nucleophile, and optionally forming a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the resulting compound of the formula I . Suitable values for Include C1, Br, I, OS02CH3 or OS02C6H4pCH3. Favoured values for 0 inclde C1, Br and I. Particularly suitably the compound Q3R4 is a benzyl halide such as benzyl bromide or benzyl chloride. The reaction may be carried out under conventional alkylation conditions for example in an inert solvent such as dimethylformamide in the presence of an acid acceptor such as potassium carbonate. Generally the reaction is carried out at a non extreme temperature such as at ambient or at a slightly elevated temperature. It is preferred to interconvert R4 in the compound of the formula XII before coupling with the compound of the formula XI . Conventional protection of the primary amine group is then preferred. Substituents of R4 may be interconverted, in particular such substituents as are representable byL R10 as defined hereinbefore whore R10 may be interconverted. Thus, when R10 is carboxy or esterified carboxy it may be converted to esterified carboxy or carboxy respectively by conventional esterification dr deesterification reactions as appropriate. R10 hydroxy is derivable from R10 C14 alkoxy whenR1 is not C14 alkoxy or from R10 in vivo hydrolysable acyloxy and L R10 C 1 4 hydroxyalkyl may be prepared from L R10 carboxy or carboxy C1 3 alkyl of the same number of carbon atoms, optionally esterified. Conversion of E10C1 4 alkoxy to hydroxy is conveniently effected by conventional methods, such as by warming with aqueous hydrobromic acid. Alternatively this may be carried out by treatment with pyridine hydrochloride, boron tribormide or boron triiodide or iodotrimethylsilane. When R10 is in vivo hydrolysable acyloxy as defined conversion may be effected conventionally, for example by acidic or basic hydrolysis. When L R10 is carboxy or carboxy C1 3 alkyl as defined, optionally esterified, conversion to L R10 C1 4 hydroxyalkyl may be effected by selective metal complex hydride reduction eg using lithium borohydride under conventional conditions. Compounds of the formula I wherein R10 is C14 alkoxy or in vivo hydrolysable acyloxy are derivable by conventional O alkylation or esterification reactions respectively from hydroxy R10 compounds. For alkoxy derivatives, the reaction may be carried out under conventional O alkylation conditions, using a compound of the formula R11ÚQ where R11Ú is C1 4 alkyl and Q is a group readily displaceable by a nucleophile.Suitable examples of Q include halide such as C1, Rr or I or labile acyloxy groups such as OS02CH3 or OS02.C6H4.p CH3. The reaction is generally effected in an inert solvent, at a non extreme temperature such as ambient or slightly elevated temperature, for example solvent reflux temperature. For in vivo hydrolysable esters, the reaction may be carried out under conventional esterification conditions 2 2 using a compound of the formula R 11W wherein R 11 is an acyl group capable of forming an in vivo hydrolysable acyloxy group and W is a group which facilitates ester formation. When W is halide the reaction is generally carried out in the presence of a base when W is hydroxyl it is generally effected in the presence of a dehydrating agent such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, in an inert solvent, at a non extreme temperature such as ambient or slightly elevated temperature, for example solvent reflux temperature. It will be appreciated by the skilled man thatO alkylation or O acylation may also lead to amineN alkylation or N acylation, unless any nitrogen atom s is are protected, as necessary. For example, this may be conveniently done by carrying out acylation in the presence of a strong acid such as trifluoroacetic acid, so that any amine function is protected by protonation. The acid may conveniently also act as the solvent. It will of course be appreciated that all the foregoing conversions may also be effected on corresponding variables in those reaction products of the coupling of the compounds of formulae XI and. XII which are not of formula I . The acid addition salts of compounds of the formula I may be prepared in entirely conventional manner by reacting a compound of the formula I in base form with the chosen acid. The quaternary ammonium salts of the compounds of the formula I may be prepared in conventional manner for such salts, such as by reaction of the chosen compound of the formula I with a compound R8Y as defined. This reaction is suitably carried out in an appropriate solvent such as acetone, methanol, ethanol, dimethylformamide and the like, at ambient or raised temperature and pressure. The nitrogen atom of the heterocycle side chain may also form an N oxide to give an internal N oxide salt of the compound of the formula I . The N oxides may be prepared in conventional manner such as by reaction of the chosen compound of the formula I with an organic per acid, such as m chloroperbenzoic acid. This reaction is suitably carried out at below ambient in e.g. a chlorinated hydrocarbon. From the foregoing it will be seen that the invention provides a number of other processes for the preparation of a compound of the formula I characterised by a the reduction of a compound of the formula XV EMI25.1 b orthe reaction of a compound of the formula XVI EMI26.1 with a compound Q3R4. Variables and reaction conditions are as hereinbefore defined and described. As hereinbefore stated1 the compounds of the formula I are dopamine antagonists. The compounds of the present invention are dopamine antagonists and may generally be used in the treatment of emesis. Depending on their balance between peripheral and central action on the nervous system, they may also be used in the treatment of disorders relating to impaired gastro intestinal motility, such as retarded gastric emptying, dyspepsia, flatulence, oesophagal reflux and peptic ulcer and or in the treatment of disorders of the central nervous system, such as psychosis. The invention therefore also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the formula I , or a solvate or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Such compositions may be adapted for oral or parenteral administration, and as such may be in the form of tablets, capsules, oral liquid preparations, powders, granules, lozenges, reconstitutable powders, injectable and infusable solutions or suspensions the compositions may also be in the form of suppositories. Normally, orally administrable compositions are preferred. Tablets and capsules for oral administration may be in unit dose presentation form, and may contain conventional excipients such as binding agents, fillers, tabletting lubricants, disintegrants, and acceptable wetting agents.The tablets may be coated according to methods well known in normal pharmaceutical practice.Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of, for example, aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups, or elixirs, or may be presented in a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents, emulsifying agents, non aqueous vehicles which may include edible oils , preservatives, and if desired conventional flavouring or colouring agents. For parenteral administration, fluid unit dosage forms are prepared utilising the compound of the formula I and a sterile vehicle. The compound, depending on the vehicle and concentration used, can be either suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. In preparing solutions the compound can be dissolved for injection and filter sterilized before filling into a suitable vial or ampoule and sealing. Advantageously, adjuvants such as a local anaesthetic, preservatives and buffering agents can be dissolved in the vehicle. Parenteral suspensions are prepared in substantially the same manner except that the compound is suspended in the vehicle instead of being dissolved and sterilized by exposure to ethylene oxide before suspending in the sterile vehicle. Advantageously, a surfactant or wetting agent is included in the composition to facilitate uniform distribution of the compound. As is common practice, the compositions will usually be accompanied by written or printed directions for use in the medical treatment concerned. The invention further provides a method of treatment of disorders in mammals including humans comprising the administration of an effective amount of a compound of the formula I or a solvate or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to the sufferer. The effective amount will depend in the usual way on a number of factors such as the nature and severity of the malady to be treated, the weight of the sufferer, and the actual compound used. It will of course be realised that the precise dosage used in the treatment of any of the hereinbefore described disorders will depend on the actual compound of the formula I used, and also on other factors such as the seriousness of the disorders. However by way of illustration, unit doses will suitably contain 0.1 to 20 mgs of the compound of formula I , for example 0.5 to 10 mgs. Again by way of illustration, such unit doses will suitably be administered more than once a day, for example 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 times a day, in such a way that the total daily dose is suitably in the range 0.01 to 10 mg kg per day. Compounds of the formula I have the ability to potentiate the effect of conventional analgesics in migraine treatment when administered concurrently with the analgesic. Thus the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the formula I and an analgesic. The compound of the formula I and the analgesic, such as aspirin or paracetamol. will be present in the composition in amounts generally similar to their usual effective dose. The composition can be a combination product, for example a tablet or capsule containing both a compound of the formula I and an analgesic for oral administration, or a twin pack comprising the two active ingredients made up for separate administration. The invention accordingly provides a method of treatment of migraine comprising the administration to the sufferer of a compound of the formula I and an analgesic. The invention also provides a compound of formula Ij or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for use in treating CNS disorders or disorders related to impaired gastric motility in humans.

PHARMACOLOGICAL DATA The results in the following table are an illustration of the anti psychotic activity of the present compounds as shown by Inhibition of Apormorphine Induced Climbing in the Mouse, a standard test. Inhibition of apomorphine induced climbing in the mouse The test is based on that described by Protais,P.,Constantin, J.and Schwartz J.C. 1976 , Psychopharmacology, 50, 1 6. When mice are given a dose of 1 mg kg apomorphine and then placed in an enclosed environment, such as an inverted wire cage, they are seen to climb around the walls. This behavioural phenomenon is though to be a consequence of the stimulation of post synaptic Dopamine D.A. receptors in the nucleus accumbens. Inhibition of apomorphine induced climbing is therefore indicative of post synaptic D.A.receptor blockade in accumbens. Groups on 10 male CD1 mice, weighing 25 30 g were pretreated orally with either graded doses of the test compound or vehicle, at appropriate time intervals before the subcutaneous administration of a sub maximal dose of apomorphine 1 mg kg . Immediately after the apomorphine injection the mice were placed in wire climbing cages and each animal was scored for climbing behaviour at 10 and 20 minutes post apomorphine as follows Four paws on cage floor 0 Fore paws on cage wall 1 Four paws on cage wall 2 The total score was calculated for each group of mice and expressed as a percentage inhibition of climbing. inhibition 100 Total score for test compound x 10 Total score for apomorphine control ED5O s and fiducial limits were calculated according to the method of Litchfield and Wilcoxon, the ED50 being the dose that produced a 50 inhibition of apomorphineinduced climbing.
