## Description
This invention relates to thickeners for, and methods of, thickening aqueous media, particularly those which contain high concentrations of electrolyte such as drilling muds, detergents, cleaners, slurries of blasting agents, and especially printing pastes, more especially those for printing textile materials, which pastes contain dyestuffs, especially reactive, disperse, pigment, mordant and direct dyes. GB A 2017159 discloses the thickening of reactive dye containing printing pastes with meth acrylamide homopolymers and copolymers in the form of swollen beads. However, these beads tend to block the screens of screen printing machines and provide a paste which is not particularly smooth. GB A 2077750 describes the thickening of an aqueous based composition by adding thereto a water in oil emulsion of a water soluble meth acrylamide homopolymer or copolymer, which homopolymer or copolymer is present in solution in the aqueous phase of the water in oil emulsion. Example 3 thereof describes the thickening of unspecified textile pigment printing pastes with a water in oil emulsion of an acrylamide ammonium acrylate copolymer crosslinked with 0.50 of allyl methacrylate. These thickeners allow the thickening to take place more quickly than with conventional thickeners and provide a paste with improved smoothness. However, pastes such as those described above which employ, as the sole thickener, a non ionic, or predominantly non ionic thickening polymer tend to have poor rheological properties. In particular, their viscosity tends to change when the paste is subjected to the shear forces which obtain in conventional printing processes. A similar viscosity change occurs when using known acrylic acid homopolymers as thickeners see EP A 0077297 . Furthermore, it is necessary to neutralize such acrylic acid polymers before use. EP A 0077297 teaches the use of a mixture of both acrylic acid and a copolymer thereof with an acrylamide and recommends the use of a water in oil emulsion of the polymer mixture. According to EP A 0077297, a printing paste containing such a mixture of polymers does not experience the abovementioned change in viscosity when applied to a textile material by a conventional printing technique. GB A 2007238 also discloses the use of a mixture of polymers, namely of water soluble and water swellable polymers, both of which are predominantly acrylamide polymers. Some of the above polymers consist partially of ionic groups. Certain of the special properties of ionic polymers in aqueous solution can be considered to be due to the presence of macro ions i.e. high molecular weight charged moieties but even aqueous solutions of ionic polymers are sensitive to the presence of added simple electrolytes. In general the salts depress the viscosity of the polyelectrolyte solution over a wide range of concentrations. Even the electrolyte in a conventional disperse dye can cause a substantial drop in viscosity see Textile Printing , LC.W. Miles p.232 264 . We also find that the known pastes referred to above tend to give poor results under the conditions necessary for printing other dyestuffs, especially reactive dyestuffs. Thus reactive dyes differ from other colouring materials in that they enter into chemical reaction with cellulose and some other fibres during the dyeing process and so become part of the fibre see Kirk Othmer Encyclopaedia of Chemical Technology 1979, v8, pages 374 392, This reaction involves, for example, the hydroxyl groups on cellulose fibres, which reaction has been shown to be ionic in character. The ionisation of the hydroxyl groups increases with increasing alkalinity and above a pH of 8 there are sufficient ionised hydroxyl groups to allow the reaction of enough dye molecules to give any normal depth of shade. In the practical application of a printing paste containing a reactive dye to a textile material the desired pH is obtained by the addition to the paste of alkaline materials such as sodium hydrogen carbonate. Such paste contain large amounts of electrolyte. Indeed the reactive dye itself is an electrolyte. This addition of electrolyte to pastes containing the known thickeners described above causes an undesirable reduction in their viscosity. W O A 83 00337 describes the preparation of a water in oil emulsion of a water soluble polymer in which the polymer is in solution in the aqueous phase of the emulsion. In this method a portion of a water soluble inverting surfactant is added to a water in oil emulsion of the monomer from which the polymer is derived and, after polymerization, a further portion of water soluble inverting surfactant is added to the resultant water in oil emulsion of the polymer. This method enables a larger amount of polymer to be dissolved in the water on inversion so as to increase the viscosity of the thickened aqueous medium. Such water in oil emulsions are said to be effective as fluid mobility control agents in the presence of dissolved salts, though there is no reference to thickening of printing pastes. A further disadvantage associated with the use of water soluble polymers in the form of inverse emulsions for thickening printing pastes, such as the acrylamide polymer emulsions described in EP A 0077297, is that the use of such polymer emulsions gives prints with a harsh handle see P. Bajaj et al, Colourage 1982, 29 20 , 7 . The result has been that up till now it has been necessary to include softeners in the print paste to obtain the desired handle in the finished prints. Surprisingly, we have found a thickener which can be used for successfully and economically thickening an aqueous medium, especially a printing paste containing a colouring matter especially a reactive, disperse or pigment dye of mixture thereof without the abovementioned disadvantages. According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a thickener which comprises a polymer in the form of a water in oil emulsion. i.e. an emulsion of an aqueous phase containing the polymer in a continuous organic medium immiscible with water, the polymer being present in solution in the aqueous phase of the emulsion which polymer contains residues derived from unsaturated monomer or monomers at least some of which residues contain an ionisable, preferably anionic, group so that the polymer is partially or essentially wholly ionic in nature, but the polymer of which includes a minor, crosslinking part, which part is derived from a small proportion, preferably 0.0005 to 5 , based on the total weight of polymerizable monomers, of at least one crosslinking monomer containing at least two unsaturated groups and capable of crosslinking, which thickener additionally contains an ionic surfactant, present in a large amount, namely at least 20 by weight of solid polymer, which ionic surfactant is soluble to a greater extent in the oil phase of the water in oil emulsion than in the water phase. A thickener in accordance with the invention is capable of increasing the viscosity of an aqueous medium containing an electrolyte to an extent which is at least as great as the content to which the thickeners will increase the viscosity of a corresponding aqueous medium from which the electrolyte is absent. Other aspects of the invention respectively provide a method of thickening a printing paste with the above mentioned thickener, a printing paste containing it and a method of dyeing a textile fabric with a printing paste to thickened. The method of thickening comprises incorporating in the aqueous medium a water in oil emulsion, the water phase of which has, in solution therein, a water soluble polymer which is partially or essentially wholly ionic in nature so as to contain ionisable residues derived from at least one unsaturated monomer and additionally including a minor, crosslinked part derived from at least one crosslinking monomer containing at least two unsaturated groups, which method is characterised in that the method additionally includes incorporating in the aqueous medium to be thickened at least 20 , by weight of solid said polymer, of an ionic surfactant, which ionic surfactant is soluble to a greater extent in the oil phase of the water in oil emulsion than in the water phase. The water in oil emulsion of the polymer may be prepared an in situ polymerization in which the polymer emulsion is prepared directly from the constituent monomers by a so called inverse emulsion polymerization technique in which a water in oil emulsion of an aqueous solution of the monomers is formed, in the presence of a catalytic amount of a free radical yielding initiator so as to effect polymerization, the monomers being so chosen, and the process being so controlled, that the polymer product is in solution in the aqueous phase of a water in oil emulsion product. This product is useful, in this form, as a thickener of the present invention and need not be neutralized before use. Preferred ionisable unsaturated monomers are anionic and suitable monomers are acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, their alkali metal and ammonium salts, 2 acrylamido 2 methyl propanesulphonic acid, 2 sulphoethyl methacrylate, styrene phosphonic acid, sodium styrene sulphonate and phosphonic acid derivatives of meth acrylates and mixtures of any of these with one another. The resultant polymer may be essentially a homopolymer or a copolymer containing two or more such monomers. The crosslinking monomers that can be used include allyl methacrylate, methylene bis acrylamide, diallyl phthalate, diallyl urea, glycol di meth acrylates, triallyl cyanurate, triallyl isocyanurate, polyfunctional alkylene ethers and mixtures of any of these with one another. They are especially preferably present in an amount by weight of from 0.04 2 depending upon the conditions of use of the printing paste to be thickened. An amount of cross linking agent often preferred is below 1 . The thickener in accordance with the invention is suitable for thickening aqueous media, particularly those which contain high concentrations of electrolyte such as drilling muds, detergents, cleaners, and slurries of blasting agents, but is especially suitable for thickening pastes containing reactive, disperse, pigment, mordant or direct dyes or mixtures of any of these with each other. Typical fabrics to be printed include cellulosic fibres such as cotton and regenerated cellulosic fibres such as cellusose acetate, synthetic fibres such as polyesters and acrylics and mixtures of cellulosic and synthetic fibres, e.g. cotton polyester fibres. A particular preferred polymer is derived at least mainly from acrylic acid but the choice of preferred unsaturated monomer s will vary with the choice of dyestuff as later described in more detail. A thickener in accordance with the invention carries with it the following advantages It is fully compatible with a wide range of dyestuffs and application conditions and indeed as later described the choice of unsaturated and crosslinkig monomers and the amount of crosslinking monomer may be tailored to suit a chosen dyestuff and or its conditions of application. The requirement for the addition of modifying components may be eliminated, especially by selecting, in advance, a particular monomer for use with a given dyestuff and or its conditions of application. Thus the need to blend the polymer with other thickeners or adjust the pH of the thickener, for example, to effect neutralization, can be avoided. The thickener provides a particularly smooth paste which does not tend to block the screens of screen printing machines nor reduces in viscosity as a result of the shear forces experienced in conventiional printing techniques. The tolerance of the thickener to the presence of electrolytes is especially high and can be rendered even higher by selection of particular monomers and the degree of crosslinking. Thus, as previously explained, reactive dyes are applied at a pH of from about 8 9 in the presence of relatively large of electrolyte. For such conditions, we find that the sodium salt of the ionic groups of unsaturated monomers such as acrylic acid have an especially high electrolyte resistance in other words their viscosity is not reduced by the presence of such large quantities of electrolyte. However, for the application of pastes containing pigment dyes also applied at a pH of from 8 9 and disperse dyes generally applied at a pH of from 6 7.5 , the ammonium salt of the anionic groups of the unsaturated monomer such as acrylic acid is preferred. Thus, with this knowledge, the user may select the particular unsaturated monomer in dependence upon the dyestuff and conditions of application to be encountered. As previously mentioned, the water in oil emulsions may be prepared by the so called inverse emulsion polymerization technique. This is preferably carried out by forming a water in oil emulsion of an aqueous solution of the monomers within an organic medium such as white mineral oil or paraffin or mixtures thereof, wherein the organic medium contains a surfactant or mixture of surfactants each having a hydrophobe lypophile balance HLB below 9. This surfactant will be present in the final product produced by the process, and the product of the above process may be used directly as a thickener. However, there must be includes either in the thickener or in the printing paste to be thickened thereby a further surfactant, hereinafter called a thickener surfactant , which will assist release of the dispersed droplets of polymer solution uniformly into the printing paste. Good results may be achieved using an oil soluble thickener surfactant which, when added to the thickener, will be present in solution in the continuous phase of the water in oil emulsion. We find that particularly good results are achieved when using, as thickener surfactant, a dioctyl ester of sodium sulphosuccinate. This gives an especially stable thickened printing paste having especially high electrolyte resistance. Furthermore, it enables lower quantities of polymer to be used for achieving the same high viscosity. We have surprisingly found that a thickener system, which may contain either a wholly ionic water soluble polymer, or which may even contain a water soluble polymer which is only partially ionic, but which contains at least 20 by weight of solid said polymer, of the abovementioned oil soluble ionic surfactant, can be used to thicken compositions which do not suffer a drop in viscosity upon the addition of large amounts of electrolytes. Indeed such thickened compositions can show an increase in viscosity upon the addition of electrolytes, the viscosity increase being dependent upon the amount of surfactant used. This is unique and contrary to all the known properties of polyelectrolytes. The oil soluble ionic surfactant. i.e. the surfactant which is soluble to a greater extent in the oil phase of the water in oil emulsion than in the water phase thereof, preferably has a solubility in at least one organic liquid capable of use as an oil phase of a water in oil emulsion of at least 10 , especially up to 50 , by weight of solution. The thickener system contains at least about 20 of the oil soluble surfactant based on the weight of solids polymer of the polymer component. At the minimum level, a slight decrease in viscosity on addition of electrolyte to a thickened medium may occur but, in general, such decreases are of an acceptable order. Preferably, however, the solid surfactant polymer weight ratio is at least 30 . The oil soluble ionic surfactant may be present in the water in oil emulsion. Alternatively, the oil soluble ionic surfactant may be separate from the water in oil emulsion, in which case it may be added to the medium to be thickened either before, simultaneously with, or after addition of the water in oil emulsion. Particularly rapid thickening can be achieved using a mixture of surfactants. The ratio of total solid surfactant solid polymer, the particular surfactant or surfactants used and, where a mixture is used, the proportional amounts of surfactant in the mixture can be selected to achieve an especially rapid and efficient thickening without a decrease in viscosity occurring on addition of electrolyte. Suitable, anionic surfactants include alkali metal salts of alkyl aryl sulphonic acids, sodium bis tridecyl sulphosuccinate, sodium dioctyl sulphosuccinate and mixtures thereof. Suitable cationic surfactants include quaternary ammonium compounds and derivatives of fatty amines and amides. As mentioned above, the polymer component of the thickener is present in solution in the aqueous phase of the water in oil polymer emulsion. The polymer component may consist of a polymer each of the residues of which, apart from minor amounts of polyfunctional monomer which may be present, is ionisable a wholly ionic polymer , a polymer some of the residues of which are ionisable and some of which are non ionisable a partially ionic polymer , or a mixture of a wholly ionic or partially ionic polymer with a non ionic polymer such as a mixture of a wholly ionic synthetic polymer with a non ionic synthetic or natural organic polymer. Water soluble polymers which are particularly compatible with the preferred oil soluble surfactants are those made wholly or partially of ionic monomers or mixtures of polymers containing ionic groups and polymers having no ionic character. Suitable anionic monomers from which the water soluble polymers may be derived include acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, 2 acrylamido 2 methyl propanesulphonic acid, 2 sulphoethyl methacrylate, styrene phosphonic acid, their alkali metal and ammonium salts. sodium styrene sulphonate and mixtures of any of these with one another. Suitable cationic monomers from which the water soluble polymers may be derived include dimethylaminoethyl methyl acrylate and quaternised derivatives, diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride, diallyl diethyl ammonium chloride and mixtures of any of these with one another. The monomers having no ionic character which may provide residues in a partially ionic or non ionic water soluble polymer include acrylamide, methacrylamide and vinyl pyrrolidone. Minor amounts of polyfunctional monomers may be incorporated into the water soluble polymer to provide the correct balance of properties. Suitable polyfunctional monomers include difunctional monomers such as diallyl urea, methylene bis acrylamide, allyl methacrylate, diallyl phthalate, glycol di meth acrylate, triallyl cyanurate, triallyl isocyanurate and polyfunctional poly alkylene ethers. Such monomers are preferably used in amounts of 0.005 2 by weight of the total monomers, usually below 0.5 . The water soluble polymers may be made by any of the well known techniques but, as mentioned above are most conveniently prepared by the inverse emulsion process. This may be accomplished by The water soluble copolymers are thus obtained as a fine dispersion of an aqueous solution of the copolymer in a non aqueous continuous phase. In a thickener embodying the present invention at least part of the oil phase of the water in oil emulsion of the water soluble polymer may be a silicone oil. We have found that printing pastes thickened by the use of such inverse emulsions of water soluble polymers in which the continuous oil phase consists wholly, or in part, of a silicone oil give prints which are softer than those in which the continuous phase is wholly hydrocarbon or halogenated hydrocarbon, and thus give improved handle to the printed fabric. The softness obtained is proportional both to the amount of silicone oil of a given viscosity used, and to the viscosity of the silicone oil used for a given amount. The silicone oils useful in this invention include those from dimethyl polysiloxane and methyl hydrogen polysiloxane. These are commercially available as Fluid 200 range from Dow Corning and Tegiloxan range ex T. H. Goldsmith, respectively. When the silicone oil is a minor constituent of the continuous phase, it can be added to the inverse emulsion thickener latex after polymerisation has been completed or the appropriate amount can be added directly to the print paste formulation. Thickeners embodying the invention will now be described in more detail with reference to the following Examples. In the Examples, trade names are indicated by . All viscosity measurements were made with a Brookfield RVT, spindle 6, speed 5 at 25 C. Colour Index Numbers of colourants used in the examples. Examples 2 and 4 7 illustrate thickeners embodying the invention in which a large amount of an oil soluble ionic surfactant is employed. Examples 1 and 3 are comparative. In Examples 4 and 6 and experiment No.60 of Examples 5 and 7, the thickener contains a polymer which is essentially wholly ionic in nature, while in the remainder of these Examples, the thickener contains a polymer which is only partially ionic. A partially ionic copolymer containing 19 mole sodium acrylate and 81 mole acrylamide plus 0.02 by weight of total monomers of methylene bis acrylamide was prepared by the preferred inverse emulsion process and the resultant latex had polymer solids content of 26.2 by weight. A reactive dye base was made consisting of an aqueous solution containing 10 urea, 3 sodium hydrogen carbonate and 1 of a dye reduction inhibitor all by weight . Various combinations of dye base, water soluble surfactants and polymer were made and their viscosities measured before and after addition of a reactive dye and sodium chloride. These results are shown in Table I and it can be seen that normal behaviour on inversion of the inverse emulsion by means of water soluble surfactants ocurred and that a , the viscosity decreases on the addition of electrolytes, b the lower the polymer concentration the lower the viscosity prior to addition of electrolyte. Replacement of the water soluble surfactant Ethylan BCP A 9 mole ethoxylated nonyl phenol by Ethylan TU an 8 mole ethoxylated nonyl phenol , Tween 20 a 20 mole oxyethylate monolauric acid HLB 16.7, Tween 40 a 20 mole oxyethylated monopalmitic acid HLB 15.6 , Tween 60 a 20 mole oxyethylated monostearic acid HLB 14.9 , Tween 80 a 20 mole oxyethylated monooleic acid HLB 15 , Texofor D40 an ethoxylate derived from glyceride oils , Texofor 65A30P and Texofor T95 all non ionic water soluble surfactants gave similar results to those shown for Ethylan BCP in Table I. Using the polymer emulsion described in Example 1 but employing an oil soluble surfactant in place of a water soluble surfactant a different picture is obtained. Firstly there is no significant difference in base viscosity as the amount of polymer is reduced and the oil soluble surfactant is increased and secondly the viscosity increases on the addition of electrolyte either in the form of reactive dye or sodium chloride. This is illustrated in Table II. This effect is not confined to one dyestuff as is shown in Table III. An ionic homopolymer was made by inverse emulsion polymerisation of sodium acrylate with the incorporation of 0.02 diallyl urea and 0.02 methylene bis acrylamide both by weight based on total polymerisable material . The resulting latex had polymer solids content of 27.3 by weight. A reactive dye base was made as in Example 1 and various combinations of dye base, water soluble surfactant and polymer were made and their viscosities measured before and after the addition of a reactive dye. The results are shown in Table IV and the same effects as in Example 1 were noted viz Replacement of the water soluble surfactant by other water soluble surfactants as in Example 1 gave similar results. Using the polymer described in Example 3 but employing an oil soluble surfactant in place of a water soluble surfactant a different picture is obtained as can be seen from Table V. Polymer emulsions from Examples, 1 and 3, but containing an oil soluble surfactant, were used to thicken a mixture of textile colorants viz parts by weight The colorant base consisted of an aqueous solution of 10 urea, 3 sodium hydrogen carbonate and 1 Calgon T which was 82.5 of the composition. An oil soluble surfactant was incorporated at 3 . These again show the increase in viscosity upon addition of colorant mixture.
