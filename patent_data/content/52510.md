## Description
This invention relates to pharmaceutical microcapsule compositions having sustained release characteristics where the active agent is a water soluble polypeptide which is a luteinizing hormone releasing hormone, or analogue thereof, useful for affecting the reproduction function in mammals. There are a number of publications that disclose combinations of polymers and drugs designed to give sustained or delayed release of drugs. For example U.S. Patent 3,773,919 discloses controlled drug release compositions in which the core comprises a drug, stated to include water soluble antibiotic polypeptides encapsulated in polylactide glycolide copolymers as well as similar such polymers. Microencapsulation for sustained release of enzymes, hormones, vaccines and other biologicals is discussed in a paper by Chang, Thomas, J. Bioeng., Vol. 1, pp 25 32, 1976. Several examples of water soluble protein encapsulations using polylactic acid are disclosed therein, particularly asparaginase and insulin compositions. Polylactic acid polymers, polylactide glycolide copolymers and polyglycolic acid polymers and related materials have been used for making surgical elements, incorporating a medicament and demonstrating slow release properties. See for example U.S. Patents 3,991,776 4,118,470 4.076,798. The invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition designed for sustained release of an effective amount of drug over an extended period of time prepared in microcapsule form wherein the composition comprises Said composition will release a daily amount of said polypeptide effective for maintaining an hormonally related condition over a predetermined period of time. The specific hormonally related condition bound to the use of said polypeptide is the control of fertility and physiological effects related thereto. The polymer hydrolysis modifying agents which may be optionally present in the composition may decrease or increase the rate of polymer hydrolysis. They have a low molecular weight and are non toxic. The invention also relates to a process for preparing the above pharmaceutical composition, comprising Naturally occurring LH RH peptides are produced in the hypothalmic region of the brain and control the reproductive cycle of mammals by acting on the anterior pituitary gland to affect release of luteinizing hormone LH and follicular stimulating hormone FSH which in turn act on the gonads to stimulate the synthesis of steroid hormones and to stimulate gamete maturation. The pulsatile release of LH RH thereby controls the reproductive cycle in mammals. Additionally, LH RH has effects in placenta, in releasing HCG, and directly on the gonads. Agonist analogs of LH RH are useful for the control of fertility by two mechanisms of action. Low doses of LH RH analogues can stimulate ovulation and are useful in the treatment of hypothalmic and ovulatory infertility. Additionally they can be used for hypogonadal conditions and impotence, and to stimulate spermatogenesis and androgen production in the male. Paradoxically, larger doses of highly potent and long lasting analogues of LH RH have an opposite effect and block ovulation in the female and suppress spermatogenesis in the male. Related to these effects is a suppression of normal circulating levels of sexual steroids of gonadal origin, including reduction in accessory organ weight in the male and female. In domestic animals this paradoxical effect promotes weight gain in a feed lot situation, stimulates abortion in pregnant animals and in general, acts as a chemical sterilant. A full list of the paradoxical high dose effects is set out in European Patent application EP A 21234. There is also the group of LH RH analogues termed antagonists. These polypeptides have the paradoxical effect shown by LH RH agonists but at low dose levels relative to naturally occurring LH RH. Such compounds are to be included within the scope of this invention. The natural hormone releasing hormone LH RH is a decapeptide comprised of naturally occurring amino acids which have the L configuration except for the achiral amino acid glycine . Its sequence is as follows Many analogues of this natural material have been studied. The beneficial effectiveness of these analogues has been varied. The most significant modification where agonists are concerned is obtained by changing the 6 position residue from Gly to a D amino acid, for example, D Ala, D Leu, D Phe or D Trp. Antagonist activity can be best realized by substituting the naturally occurring 2 position His amino acid residue with with a D amino acid residue. These analogues show increased activity relative to LH RH. In addition to modifications position 6, increased agonist activity may be obtained by the following modifications modifying position 10 to afford a nonapeptide as an alkyl , cycloalkyl or fluoroalkyl amine, or by replacing Gly NH₂ by an α azaglycine amide substituting N methyl leucine for leucine in position 7 replacing tryptophan in position 3 by 3 1 naphthyl L alanine substituting the position 5 tyrosine residue with phenylalanine or 3 1 pentafluorophenyl L alanine and the substitution at position 6 of unnatural D amino acid residues containing two or more carbocyclic or perhydroaryl rings or a phenyl or cyclohexyl ring which is highly alkyl substituted. These specific compounds represent some of the more useful fertility affecting LH RH type polypeptides which have been developed to date. This is not intended to be an exhaustive or exclusive list of all such compounds which which have been made or which can or may be made. They are simply set out to illustrate the type of compounds which are the subject of this invention. Any and all of them can be interchangeably substituted into the compositions of this invention. The compounds of specific interest herein are those from the last mentioned group wherein the 6 position of the naturally occurring LH RH material is replaced with a specific unnatural D amino residue containing lipophilic carbocyclic residues, particularly residues containing two or more highly alkyl substituted carbocyclic aryl or perhydroaryl rings or a phenyl or cyclohexyl ring. These particular polypeptides are the subject of European Patent application EP A 21234, and are prepared in accordance with the procedures set forth therein. More specifically the polypeptides of particular interest in this invention are nonapeptides and decapeptides of the formula wherein R is R₂ is hydrogen or lower alkyl. Preferred compounds of this invention are those wherein X is 3 2 naphthyl D alanyl or 3 2,4,6 trimethylphenyl D alanyl Z is glycinamine V is tryptophyl or phenylalanyl W is tyrosyl and Y is leucyl or N methyl leucyl. Particularly preferred compounds are Especially preferred is pyro Glu His Trp Ser Tyr 3 2 naphthyl D alanyl Leu Arg Pro Gly NH₂ and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts. As set forth above and for convenience in describing these compounds, the conventional abbreviation for the various amino acids are used as generally accepted in the peptide art as recommended by the IUPAC IUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature, Biochemistry, 11, 1726 1972 and represent the L amino acids with the exception of the achiral amino acids in the 6 position designated by X. All peptide sequences mentioned herein are written according to the generally accepted convention whereby the N terminal amino acid is on the left and the C terminal amino acid is on the right. The abbreviation Et is monovalent ethane. As used herein, the term pharmaceutically acceptable salts refer to the salts that retain the desired biological activity of the parent compound and do not impart any undesired toxicological effects. Examples of such salts can be found in European Patent application EP A 21234, noted above. As used herein the term lower alkyl refers to a straight or branched chain saturated hydrocarbon group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as, for example, methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, isobutyl, sec butyl, and tert butyl the term cycloalkyl group refers to a cyclic saturated hydrocarbon group having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, for example, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl the term fluoro lower alkyl refers to a lower alkyl group wherein one or more hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine, such as, for example, trifluoromethyl, pentafluoroethyl and 2,2,2 trifluoroethyl. As used herein naphthyl is inclusive of 1 and 2 naphthyl anthryl is inclusive of 1 , 2 and 9 anthryl fluoroenyl is inclusive of 2 , 3 , 4 , and 9 fluoroenyl phenanthryl is inclusive of 2 , 3 and 9 phenanthryl and adamantyl is inclusive of 1 and 2 adamantyl. As used herein the phrase fertility affecting polypeptide should be understood to mean any naturally occurring LH RH polypeptide, synthetically prepared material of the same type or synthetically prepared analogues of naturally occurring LH RH polypeptides which act in some manner on the anterior pituitary gland to affect the release of luteinizing hormone LH and follicular stimulating hormone FSH and in particular those polypeptides which inhibit ovulation or are useful for treating endometriosis in a female mammalian subject or are useful for treating benign prostatic hypertrophy and inhibiting spermatogenesis in a male mammalian subject. The compositions of this invention will contain the hormonally active polypeptides in varying amounts depending upon the effect desired. Treatment of infertility requires a low level of drug, while prevention of fertility and related effects requires a large dose relative to the activity of naturally occurring LH RH. For the agonist fertility control it is expedient to prepare microcapsules which will release the drug at such a rate that the subject will receive between about 0.01 and 100 µg kg body weight per day, preferably between 0.1 and 5.0 µg kg body weight per day. The compositions of this invention are formulated to contain the polypeptide in an amount which may vary between 0.01 and 40.0 weight of the polymer used for encapsulation. Preferably the peptide will be present in the amount between 0.1 to 10.0 weight . The amount of drug placed in a particular formulation depends not only on the desired daily dose but also on the number of days that dose level is to be maintained. While this amount can be calculated empirically the actual dose delivered is a function of the degradation characteristics of the encapsulating polymer. Therefore the weight of drug stated represent amounts which, when taken in conjunction with a particular polymer provide the desired release profile. Optionally, certain chemicals which affect the rate of polymer hydrolysis may be dissolved in the aqueous solution containing the polypeptide before it is encapsulated by the polymer excipient. These chemicals are called polymer hydrolysis modifying agents. When present, these compounds may increase or decrease the rate at which the drug is released from the microcapsules. This effect is independent of a particular polymer composition or size. Four types of chemicals may be used to realize this effect, for example, organic acids, acidic neutral or basic salts. Low molecular weight mono and dicarboxylic acids such as acetic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, gluconic acid, oxalic acid, ascorbic acid, succinic acid, their salts may be used. Basic salts may be, for example, ammonium sulfate, ammonium chloride, ammonium nitrate and sodium bisulphate. Neutral salts effective herein include metal halides such as, for example, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium bromide, potassium bromide, calcium chloride and magnesium chloride. Basic salts include such salts as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, trisodium phosphate and tripotassium phosphate. Of these compounds it is most preferred to use either citric acid, sodium chloride or sodium carbonate. Combinations of these compounds will achieve the desired effect but the compositions described herein contain only one of these agents in a particular composition. When present the hydrolysis modifying agent will be added in an amount between 0.1 and 20 by weight of the polymer but preferably it will be present in the amount of 5 to 10 . The biocompatible, biodegradable encapsulating polymer which is used in this invention is a poly lactide coglycolide polymer. Of course, the polymer must be non toxic to the host and must be of such composition that it is degradable by the body into metabolic products that have no deleterious or untoward effects on the body. The polymer must also be capable of forming microcapsules containing water soluble drugs. A number of particular polymers have been developed which meet these criteria. See, for example U.S. Patent No. 3,773,919. The copolymers of the invention are derived from the condensation of lactic acid and glycolic acid. The acid units from which the excipients are prepared may be the optically active D and L forms or optically inactive DL , racemic forms. For example, lactic acid, whether it is the principle polymer component or the comonomer component, can be present as D lactic acid, L lactic acid or DL lactic acid. It is most preferred to use lactic acid as the principle monomer with glycolic acid as the comonomer. The term polylactide is used to designate the general glass of polymers which can be prepared from one or more of the preferred monomers listed above and includes those instances where a single alpha hydroxy acid or lactone is the only monomer in the polymer. For the most preferred polymers those wherein the excipients are prepared solely from the lactic acid monomer or where lactic acid is the principle monomer and glycolic acid is the comonomer are termed poly lactide co glycolide copolymers. The combinations of prefered monomer and comonomer which can be prepared are numerous but the most effective excipients are those polymers prepared from lactic acid alone or lactic acid and glycolic acid wherein the glycolic acid is present as a comonomer in a molar ratio of 100 0 to 40 60. It is most preferred to use a poly lactide co glycolide copolymer having a molar ratio between about 75 25 and 50 50. Poly lactide co glycolide polymers may range in size from 20,000 to 100,000 in molecular weight, stated as an average. The molecular weight of a particular copolymer is independent of its monomeric makeup. For example, a 50 50 copolymer can have a molecular weight which falls anywhere within this range. Therefore polymers can be varied both as to their monomer composition and as well as their molecular weight and be within the scope of this invention. For the purposes of this invention the relative molecular weight of a particular polymer vis a vis a second polymer is stated in terms of its inherent viscosity in a particular solvent and at a particular temperature. The viscosity of a particular polymer is measured in a capillary viscometer using chloroform or hexafluoroisopropanol at 30 C. The results are stated in terms of deciliters g dl g . There is a direct correlation between inherent viscosity and molecular weight. A method for the preparation of polylactide polymers can be found in U.S. Patent 3,773,919 and reference is made thereto for the preparation of the such polymers. Preparation of the microcapsules using any combination of the various peptides, polymer hydrolysis modifying agents or encapsulating polymer excipients noted above parallels the basic technique set out in U.S. Patent 3,773,919. A full description of the procedure used herein can be found in that document. In brief, the procedure involves dissolving the polymer in an halogenated hydrocarbon solvent, dispersing the aqueous drug solution in this polymer solvent solution, and adding some agent which is soluble in the halogenated hydrocarbon solvent but is a non solvent for the encapsulating excipient. The addition of the non solvent, called a coacervation agent, causes the excipient to precipitate out of the halogenated hydrocarbon solvent onto the dispersed water droplets, thereby encapsulating the polypeptide. For example, a poly lactide co glycolide is dissolved in methylene chloride. An aqueous solution of polypeptide is then stirred into the solvent polymer solution to form a water in oil emulsion. A second solvent miscible material such as a silicone oil, is added slowly with stirring to precipitate the excipient which coats the dispersed water droplets to give microcapsules. Halogenated organic solvents which may be used are most of the C1 to C4 halogenated alkanes such as, for example, methylene chloride, ethylene dichloride, ethylene chloride and 2,2,2 trichloroethane. Coacervation agents may be any solvent miscible polymeric, mineral oil or vegetable oil compounds which are non solvents for the encapsulating polymers. There may be used, for example, silicone oil, peanut oil, soybean oil, corn oil, cotton seed oil, coconut oil, linseed oil, and mineral oils. After being formed, the microcapsules are washed and hardened with an alkane organic solvent, washed with water, washed with an aqueous non ionic surfactant solution, and then dried at room temperature under vacuum. Microcapsules may range in diameter from about 1 to 500 µm, depending upon the techniques employed. For this invention it is preferred to have the microcapsule diameter be between 5 and 200 µm. The prepared microcapsules may be administered to a subject by any means or route desired. However the most effacious route is parenteral administration by injection, most preferably subcutaneously or intramuscularly. If the capsules are to be administered by injection they may first be suspended in some non toxic suspending vehicle. The exact make up of these injectable microcapsule suspensions will depend upon the amount of drug to be administered, the suspending capacity of the suspending agent and on the volume of solution which can be injected at a particular site or in a particular subject. The compositions of this invention exhibit sustained release of the encapsulated compounds over extended periods of time. This time period may range from one month to 3 years depending on the composition of the encapsulating excipient, its molecular weight, the diameter of the capsule, and the presence of a polymer hydrolysis modifying agent in the core. Preferably the release time will be about 1 to 24 months. The following examples illustrate the compositions and processes of this invention. This example describes the procedure for preparing a microcapsules composition wherein the polypeptide is Excipient, 4 g, were dissolved in 196 g of methylene chloride. This solution was placed in a 300 ml resin kettle equipped with a true bore stirrer having a 63 mm. Teflon Trade Mark turbine impeller driven by a Fisher Steadi Speed Trade Mark motor. In a 1 dram glass vial was dissolved 0.0571 g of polypeptide in 1.34 g of deionized water. This solution was added to the resin kettle. During this addition, the dilute polymer solution was stirred at 3200 RPM to form a water in oil emulsion. With continued stirring at that rate, 80 ml of silicone oil was added at the rate of 4.0 ml min by means of a peristaltic pump. The silicone oil caused the polymer to phase separate, and deposit as droplets of solvent swollen polymer onto the surface of the water polypeptide microdroplets. These solvent swollen polymer droplets then coalesced to form a continuous film around the water polypeptide microdroplets. The microcapsules were then hardened by pouring the contents of the resin kettle into a beaker containing 2000 ml of heptane. This mixture was stirred at 1000 RPM for 30 minutes with a stainless steel impeller. The heptane methylene chloride silicone oil solution was removed by filtering the solution, employing a Buchner funnel and Whatman β41 filter paper. The microcapsules were then washed repeatedly with 100 ml aliquots of heptane to insure complete removal of the silicone oil. The microcapsules were then washed with deionized water followed by a wash with a 1 aqueous solution of Tween 20 Trade Mark . and dried at room temperature under vacuum. Microcapsules obtained from this preparation were determined to have diameters ranging in size from 10 to 40 µm. The polypeptide containing microcapsules, whose preparation is described in the above paragraph, were suspended in a suspending vehicle and administered as a single subcutaneous injection to female Sprague Dawley rats and female rhesus monkeys. The length of estrous suppression was calculated against the percentage of animals showing suppression. The results of the monkey study are given in Table I below. Each data line represents one subject. The injected dose was as stated in the Table. Microcapsules were prepared as stated in Example I using that LH RH analogue and a 50 50 molar ratio copolymer PLA PGA having an inherent viscosity of 0.38 dl g in hexafluoroisopropanol at 30 C at a 1.4 peptide to polymer ratio. The microcapsule s diameter ranged from 10 to 40 µm. A single 300 µg dose of D Nal 2 ⁶ LH RH micro encapsulated at 1.4 peptide to polymer with a 50 50 molar ratio poly lactide co glycolide having a diameter ranging in size from 10 40 µm inherent viscosity in hexafluoroisopropanol 0.38 dl g which had been suspended in a suspending agent composition given in Example III was injected subcutaneously in 10 mature female Sprague Dawley rats. Estrous was determined by daily vaginal smear analysis. All rats showed estrous suppression through day 24 post dosing. At day 25, 40 showed estrous. By day 27 estrous was observed in all animals. Table II sets out several examples of polypeptide containing microcapsules wherein the following parameters were varied molecular weight, stated as inherent viscosity stir rate addition rate of silicone oil and the amount of silicone oil added. The polypeptide encapsulated here is the same as set out in Example I. The preparation techniques described in Example I were used to prepare these materials, except as note for the stirring rates and silicone oil addition rates. The following describes a formulation for parenteral injection of polypeptide containing microcapsules prepared according to the methods disclosed herein. Microcapsules containing the polypeptide For example, 330 mg of microcapsules were suspended in 5.5 ml to provide an injectable dose of 300 µg of peptide per 0.5 ml of injectable suspension.
