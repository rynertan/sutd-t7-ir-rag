## Description
SINTERED CERAMIC ARTICLES AND METHOD FOR PRODUCITION THEREOF The present application claims priority of Japanese patent application Serial No.59 277705 filed on December 28, 1984. This invention relates to sintered ceramic articles having silicon nitride as a main ingredient and excelling in mechanical strength not only at a room temperature but also at elevated temperatures and to a method for the production of the sintered ceramic articles. Sintered ceramic articles having silicon nitride as a main ingredient possess a high heat resisting property up to 1,900 C and a low thermal expansion coefficient and, therefore, are excellent also in resistance to thermal shock. In view of these beneficial properties, their utility in applications to various high strength heat resisting parts represented by gas turbine blades and nozzles is being tried. Since these sintered ceramic articles have a high ability to corrosionproof metals, their utility as refractory materials destined to contact molten metals has already been realized. The gravest defect of silicon nitride betrayed when this compound is molded in a shaped article resides in the fact that the compound, used alone, has an extremely poor sintering property. In the sintering of a pure composition of silicon nitride as a starting material, therefore, the sintered composition enjoys the effect of hot press sintering, but fails to show the expected enhancement in density and strength. With a view to affording such sintered articles desired enhancement in textural compaction and mechanical strength, there has been invented a method which produces a sintered ceramic article by admixing silicon nitride with yttrium oxide and aluminum oxide and, optionally further combining the resultant mixture with aluminum nitride and an oxide such as titanium dioxide, molding the mixture as the raw material in a given shape, and subjecting the molded mixture to either hot pressing or atmospheric sintering. The hot pressing method and the atmospheric sintering method are highly effective in enhancing textural compaction and mechanical strength of sintered articles. The atmospheric sintering method which is particularly effective in mass production of sintered articles and is advantageous in precluding restrictions on the shapes of sintered articles to be obtained still has room for further improvement in mechanical strength. The inventors studied the problem described above and have consequently found that, in a silicon nitrtide yttrium oxide aluminum oxide aluminum nitride system, a sintered ceramic article of excellent mechanical and thermal properties is obtained even by the atmospheric sintering method when the percentage composition of the system is selected within a prescribed range and the sintering conditions are controlled. This invention has been produced in consequence of the knowledge acquired in the course of the inventors study mentioned above. It aims to provide sintered ceramic articles which can be produced by the atmospheric sintering technique and which acquire improved high temperature strength without any sacrifice of room temperature strength, resistance to thermal shock, and resistance to oxidation, and a method for the production of such sintered ceramic articles. Specifically, the sintered ceramic articles of the present invention are characterized by being produced by sintering a ceramic mixture consisting of 0.5 to 10 by weight of yttrium oxide, 0.5 to 7.5 by weight of aluminum oxide, 0.5 to 7.5 by weight of aluminum nitride, and the balance of silicon nitride with an average particle size of not more than 1 y and having an aluminum nitride aluminum oxide ratio of 0.5 5 1. The method of this invention for the production of these sintered ceramic articles is characterized by molding the aforementioned ceramic mixture in a given shape and sintering the molded ceramic mixture at 1,650 to 1,850 C in a non oxidative atmosphere. In this invention, the yttrium oxide and aluminum oxide components both function as agents for promoting the sintering. The yttrium oxide content is selected in the range of 0.5 to 10 by weight and the aluminum oxide content in the range of 0.5 to 7.5 by weight, respectively based on the total amount of the ceramic mixture. The total of the two contents is desired to fall in the range of 1 to 15 by weight based on the amount of the ceramic mixture.This is because the mechanical strength and the resistance to thermal shock exhibited by the produced sintered article are particularly good when their contents fall in the ranges mentioned above. The aluminum oxide component manifests its effect more desirably when its content exceeds 1 by weight.The silicon nitride component is effective in uniformly dispersing the other components of the ceramic mixture, particularly when the particle size of this component does not exceed 1 . Aluminum nitride which is another additive component in the ceramic mixture of this invention serves to improve the mechanical strength at elevated temperatures and contributes to the promotion of sintering. If this component is used in an excessive amount, the excess amount of the component brings about no discernible improvement of resistance to thermal shock. Thus, the aluminum nitride is selected in the range of 0.5 to 7.5t by weight. The total content of these three additive components is desired to fall in the range of 1 to 15 by weight based on the amount of the ceramic mixture.The total content of the yttrium oxide and aluminum nitride contents is desired to fall in the range of 1 to 15 by weight and the toal content of the aluminum oxide and aluminum nitride components in the range of 0.5 to 12.5 by weight, respectively based on the amount of the ceramic mixture. Further, the ratio of aluminum nitride aluminum oxide is in the range of 0.5 5 1 the strength of the sintered article is increased particularly when the ratio falls in this range. The ratio of yttrium oxide aluminum oxide is desired to be in the range of 0.5 20 1, the ratio of yttrium oxide aluminum nitride in the range of 1 lye 10 1, and the ratio of yttrium oxide total of aluminum oxide and aluminum nitride in the range of 0.5 10 1. In this invention, a ceramic mixture containing the aforementioned components in a percentage composition specified above is molded in a given shape and the molded ceramic mixture is sintered in a non oxidative atmosphere at a temperature in the range of 1,650 C to 1,8509C. The atmosphere for this sintering is required to be formed of a non oxidative gas such as nitrogen gas or argon. The reason for the non oxidative atmosphere is that when the sintering is carried out in an atmosphere containing oxygen, silicon nitride is oxided into SiO2 at elevated temperatures and the produced sintered ceramic article fails to manifest sufficiently high strength at elevated temperatures as expected.Even when this sintering is effected as described above by the so called atmospheric sintering technique, it produces a silicon nitride type sintered ceramic article compact in texture and excellent in hightemperature mechanical strength and resistance to thermal shock. Of course, this sintered ceramic article is obtained with equal properties by any of the other conventional sintering techniques such as, for example, the hot press technique, the ambient pressure technique, and the hot hydrostatic sintering HIP technique. In terms of phase composition, the sintered ceramic articles of this invention obtained as described above come in two types, i.e. the type consisting of phase type silicon nitride and a Y Si O N type compound and the type consisting of phase type silicon nitrtide, C4 phase type silicon nitride, and a Y Si O N type compound. In the component phases mentioned above, the phase type silicon nitride is the solid solution of yttrium oxide in phase type silicon nitride. The content of this particular phase tends to increase in proportion as the contents of the yttrium oxide and aluminum nitride components in the ceramic mixture are increased.It is generally held that the presence of phase type silicon nitride in a sintered ceramic article could degrade the properties of the article. In the sintered ceramic articles of this invention which have cm phase type silicon as one of the component phases thereof possess beneficial properties owing to the mixed presence of the particles of phase type silicon nitride and those of phase type silicon nitride. AS the result of a study, it has been demonstrated that when the portion having E phase type particles in an intertwined state preponderates in the texture of a sintered ceramic article, the strength of the article is inferior and that when the Y Si O N type compound is contained and phase type particles and ss phase type particles are present in a mixed state in a sintered ceramic article, and particularly when the grain boundaries between alpha phase type particles account for not more than 30 , preferably not more than 10 , the strength of the article is not inferior and the other properties thereof are satisfactory. The sintered ceramic articles produced from ceramic mixtures of the specified percentage composition by the method of this invention possess phase compositions satisfying the conditions mentioned above and, therefore, acquire satisfactory properties. Now, the present invention will be described below with reference to a working example. EXAMPLE Silicon nitride powder having an average particle size of 0.8 m, yttrium oxide powder having an average particle size of 0.9 num m, aluminum oxide powder having an average particle size of 0.6 m, and aluminum nitride powder having an average particle size of 1.0m, m, were mixed in a varying percentage composition by weight indicated in the table, with n butanol used as a solvent. The powders and the solvent were kneaded in a ball mill lined with rubber for about 24 hours. Thus, a total of 10 powdered samples, including comparative samples, were prepared. Each sample admixed with 7 by weight of stearic acid binder was molded under a pressure of 700 kg cm2 to produce a bar shaped mold of 60 mm in length, 40 mm in width, and 10 mm in width to be tested for deflective strength and a disc shaped mold of 30 mm in diameter and 10 mm in thickness to be tested for resistance to thermal shock . The molds so produced were first heated at 700 C for expulsion of the binder by volatilization and subjected to atmospheric sintering at the temperature for the period indicated correspondingly in the table to obtain sintered ceramic articles of silicon nitride type. The sintered ceramic articles so obtained were tested for density, deflective force mechanical strength , and resistance to thermal shock. The results are shown in the same table.
