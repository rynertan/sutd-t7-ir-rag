## Description
HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCE IN PARTICULAR A WASHING MACHINE WITH AUTOMATIC OPERATION AND FAULT INDICATION CONTROL.The present invention relates to a household appliance, in particular, a washing machine, of the type on which the actuators are controlled according to operating cycles over a microprocessor.Household appliances of this sort are not new. After the operator has selected the type of wash load by means of the pushbuttons, the microprocessor determines a given operating cycle which it controls in sequence. in the case of a washing machine, this involves opening the electrovalves for filling the machine with water or special additives, heating the water, turning the basket, draining off the water, spinning, etc.On certain appliances, provision is also made for operational control which usually consists in controlling an electric output signal on the microprocessor. Indirect control of this sort obviously has drawbacks in that it does not detect whether the control signal actually reaches the actuator.The aim of the present invention is to provide a household appliance of the type described but Bith direct, automatic control of the operation of each individual actuator through out the entire operating cycle.Another aim of the present invention is to detect a signal indicating a fault on one of the said actuators and memorise it for informing both the microprocessor and the operator for diagnostic purposes.Further aims and advantages of the appliance covered by the present invention will be given in the following description.The present invention therefore relates to a household appliance comprising a number of actuators controlled according to operating cycles, characterised by the fact that it corn prises means for automatic, repeat control of the operation of the said actuators by controlling electric signals obtained by means for detecting the operation of an electric signal controlling the said actuators.The invention will now be described, by way of a non limit ing example, with reference to the attached drawing, in which Fig. 1 shows a block diagram of the appliance according to the present invention Figs 1 and 2 snow detailed electric diagrams of two blocks on the Fig. 1 appliance Fig. A shos a control board on the Fig. 1 appliance Figs 5, 6, 7 and 8 show operational lo charts of the processor on the Fig. 1 appliance.Number 20 in Fig. 1 indIcates the appliance Oflj O f switch consisting of a doiible switch 21 connected mechanically to a single switch 22 those operation is complementary to switch 21. that is, when one opens the other closes and vice versa. Double switch 21 is set up on a.c. mains supply phases 23 and 24 which are connected to power control unit 25. In this Figure, multiwire connections are shown by a single line with the number of connections indicated next to it.Single switch 22, on the other hand, is series connected to block 27 comprising the control logic on the appliance, in this case, a washing machine. Block 27 is connected, over 12 vire line 28. to button panel block 29, and, over 14 vire line 31, to LED indicator block 32. Both blocks 29 and 32 are shown in more detail in Fig. 4. Block 27 is also connected to three pressure switches 34, 35, 36 arranged at different heights inside the wash tub and which consist of switches that close when the water level reaches them. The other ends of the pressure switches are grounded.Block 27 is also connected to negative temperature coefficient resistor 37 which is also grounded and serves for detecting the water temperature inside the wash tub switch 38, whose other terminal is grounded and which serves for activating a diagnostic phase on the appliance as described later on switch 39, whose other terminal is grounded and which is positioned so as to detect the presence of water in the wash tub.Block 27 is then connected, over 5 ire line 40, to block 411 which controls the speed adjustment of motor 42 controlling rotation of the basket not shown on the appliance. Motor 42 is connected to regulating block 41 over 8 vire line 43.Control logic block 27 is then connected, over 15 uire line 44, to power control unit 25. This controls a water heating resistor 45 via 2 wire line 46, a drain pump 47 via 2 wire line 48 and four electrovalves 49, 50, 51, 52 via lines 53, 54, 55 and 56 respectively and common return line 57. It also has a 3 wire line 59 connecting it to door 60 for providing, as described later, a mechanical safety lock and lock indication. Unit 25 also supplies motor speed regulating block 41 over 3 wire line 61.Fig. 2 is a detailed diagram of control logic block 27, comprising a ricroprocessor 65 , for example an MK 3870. The latter consists of a first input output group 66 connected to bloc 67 for controlling, in the normal way, column selection on indicator block 32. It is also connected to the outputs of two gate blocks 68 and 69 which receive enabling signals 70 and 71 respectively from decoder block 72 which is assembled between output group 73 from microprocessor 65 and line 28 connecting button panel block 29. Output group 73 is then connected to decoder block 75 for controlling the lines of indicators on block 32 via line 31. The outputs of gates 68 a 69 are connected to input group 66.The gate 69 input is connected to line 28 via the switches on button panel block 2 . The gate 68 input, on the other band, is connected to self did nosis signal line 76 described later on line 77, connecting it to the three pressure switches 34, 35, 36 , arA. line 78, connecting it to the output of thmesh old comparator 79 whose inverting input is connected to re sistive divider 8O, connected between a 5V terminal and ground, while its non inverting terminal is connected to the output of switch 39.Switch 38 is connected to line 28 connected to decoder 72.Resistor 37 is connected to the inverting input of threshold comparator 82 whose non inverting input is connected to the output of analogue selector 83 controlled by output group 84 on microprocessor 65. The input of analogue selector 83 receives various different reference signals 85 , for example, via block 86 comprising various resistive dividers. The output of comparator 82 is connected to input 87 on microprocessor 65.Input 90, which cuts off microprocessor 65 externally, is connected to the output of threshold comparator 91 whose inverting input is connected to resistive divider 92, connected between a 5V supply and ground, while its non inverting input is connected to resistive divider 93, connected between a 14.5V terminal and ground. An input output group 95 on microprocessor 65 is connected to inputs and outputs on a RAM memory cell block 96 which receives address signals from group 84. Block 96 has a disabling input 97 connected, together with disabling input 98 of gate block 99 described later and zeroing RESET input 100 on microprocessor 65, to the output of circuit 101.The latter is supplied with 114.5V and supplies and output signal when this input voltage falls below a preset threshold, i.e. 7.5V, a few volts lower than the threshold set for comparator 91, i.e. 12V. Memory block 96 has a supply pin 103 parallel to which is ground connected a condenser 104 of suitable capacity, e.g.250 microfarad, to provide an auxiliary voltage supply source.pin 103 is connected to the cathode of diode 105 whose anode is connected to a 8V supply terminal via resistor 106. The anode of diode 105 is connected to the anode of diode 108 whose cathode is connected to a 5V supply terminal. Two wire line 26 is then grounded by one wire and connected by the other to pin 103 via resistor 110.Microprocessor 65 has a group of four outputs 1 1 connected via line 44 to unit 25 for controlling as described later the four electrovalves 49, 502 51 and 52. Microprocessor 65 also has three outputs 112, 113, 113, 114 connected again over line 44 to unit 25 for controlling respectively as de scribtd later on door 60, drain pump 47 and heating resistor 45. Microprocessor 65 also has an output 115 connected via gate block 99 and line 44 to unit 25 for consenting as described later power supply to the actuators. Line a4 also con nects 14.5V. 8V and 5V supply from unit 25 to block 27.Line 40 connecting block 41 is also connected to output group 12b on microprocessor 65.Fig. 3 shows a detailed diagram of power control unit 25.Supply wire 24 is connected to various circuit connecting points, indicated by the same number, as ell as to one end of the primary winding of supply transformer 130, whose other end is connected, via fuse 131, to the other a.c. mains supply wire 23 . Transformer 130, with the assistance of rec tidying and voltage reducing blocks, supplies voltages of 15.5, 14.5, 8 and t5V. Wire 23 is connected to supply TRIAL 133 which is connected to wire 24 via line 59 connecting door 60 and via a device for safety locking door 60 after a preset length of time. The device may consist, for example, o a heating resistor which acts on a two metal blade activating a safety lock on door 60.TRIAC 133 is controlled by a photodiode 135 whose anode is connected to 8V and its cathode, via wire 112 , to output 112 on microprocessor 65.Activation of the safety lock on door 60 also closes a microswitch, connected between wire 24 and the cathode of photodiode 136 whose anode is connected to a 15.5V terminal via resistor 137, so as to activate an NPN phototransistor 138 .The emitter on the latter is grounded while its collector is connected, via connection 76 on line 76, to the input of gate 68 and, via resistor 140, to a 5V supply.Via a contact on relay 141 for cutting off supply to the actuators, a.c. supply wire 23 is connected to one terminal on heating resistor 45 an a.c. supply terminal on diode bridge 142 whose other a.c. supply terminal is connected to a terminal on drain pump 47 an a.c. supply terminal on diode bridge 143 whose other a.c. supply terminal is connected to wire 57 common to electrovalves 49, 50, 51 and 52 and line 61 for supplying block 41. The coil on relay 141 is connected between a 14.5V supply terminal and wire 115 connected to the output of gate block 99. The other end of heating resistor 45 is connected to a first terminal 150 of relay 151 whose common terminal is connected to wire 24. The other switch terminal 152 is connect ed to the anode of photodiode 153w which is also connected to a 15.5V supply terminal via resistor 154 , and whose cathode is connected to wire 24. photodiode 153 acts on NPN phototransistor 154 whose emitter is grounded and whose collector is connected directly to wire 76 on line 76 and, via resistor 155, to a 5V terminal. The coil on relay 151 is connected between a 14.5V terminal and wire 114 which is connected to output 114 on microprocessor 65.The terminal on drain pump 47 not connected to diode bridge 142 is connected to wire 24, via TRIAC 160 which is controlled, via resistor 161, by the output of 10V optoinsulating unit 162. The diode controlling unit 162 has its anode connected, via resistor 163, to a 8V terminal and its cathode connected, via line 113 , to output 113 on microprocessor 65.Similarly, each wire 53, 54, 55 and 56 of electrovalves 49, 50, 51 and 52 is connected to connection 24 via TRIAL 170 only one shown whose control electrode is connected, via resistor 171, to optoinsulating control unit 172, similar to 162, and whose control diode cathode is connected to one of wires 111 on line 111 connected to microprocessor 65.The two d.c. terminals on diode bridge 142 are connected via resistor 180 parallel to which is corn cted the series connection of resistor 181 and photodiode 182 which controlsNPN phototransistor 183 whose collector is connected to a 5V terminal whose emitter is connected, via resistor 184, to the inverting input of threshold comparator 185. The latter input is also grounded via a parallel unit 186 comprying a resistor and condenser. The non inverting input of comparator 185 is connected to resistive divider 187 connected between a t5V supply terminal and ground. The output of comparator 185 is connected to wire 76 on line 76 and to a 5V supply terminal via resistor 189.The same part connections also apply to diode bridge 143 for which the same numbers are therefore used. The output of corn parator 185 is connected to wire 76 on line 76.Fig. 4 shows button panel and indicator blocks 29 and 32 to the side of on off switch 20 which fonm a panel for controlling and selecting the operating cycles as described later on. The panel consists of a first group 200 of six buttons 29 with six associated indicators 32 for setting the type of fabric being washed. A second group 201 of three buttons 29 and indicators 32 is for setting the type of dirt. A third group 202 of two buttons 29 and indicators 32 is for setting the size of the load. The bottom part of the pa nel contains an indicator 203 showing door 60 has not been closed, a group of miscellaneous operation indicators 204, 205, 206 , a group of seven water temperature indicators 207 and a group of four basket motor speeds 208 . Two buttons 210, 211 are also provided for lowering the set tings indicated by groups 207 and 208. Other controls include an end of cycle indicator 212 , a cycle start button 213 and indicator 214 , a cycle stop button 215 . a high speed operating button 216 and a malfunctioning indicator 218 .Operation of the washing machine shown in Figs 1 to 4 is programmed according to normal cycles by microprocessor 65 which suitably combines operation of electrovalves 49, 50, 51 and 52, heating resistor 45, basket motor 42 and drain pump 47.Basic operation of microprocessor 65, which controls speed regulator 41 and indicator group 32 on the basis of data received from button panel 29, level sensors 34, 35 and 36, temperature resistor 37 and water detector 39, is essentially standard and will therefore not be described in detail.what will be described is general operation of the washing machine with special emphasis on the characteristics involving the present invention.When on off switch 20 closes, switch 21 also closes and 22 opens for charging condenser 104 and supplying memory block 96. condenser 1C4 is charged for supplying block 96 under special conditions described later on. Supply voltage is sent to connections 23 and 24 and, from there, to tr nsSor mer 130 on power control unit 25 for supplying control logic block 27 and all the circuits supplied with reduced voltage from transformer 130. This enables the programme on microprocessor 65 which, after z brief diagnosis in which it turns on all the indicators 32 to check they are working, prepares to accept three settings from the operator the type of fabric, type of dirt and size of the load.For the first setting, all six indicators on group 200 start flashing and one of them is selected by pressing the relative button. Once this has been done, all the indicators on group 200 go off except the one which has been selected which stays on without flashing. At this point, the second group of in dicators 201 starts flashing and is selected in the same way as the first, followed by selection of one or other of indicators 202. Once this last setting has been made, all the indicators on the bottom of the panel 204, 205, 206 come on to show the wash cycles set by microprocessor 65 according to the operator s settings, accompanied by indicators 207 and 208 showing the hot water temperature and spinning speed provided for in the elected programme. At the same time, start light 214 begins flashing to invite the operator to start the washing operation.When cycle start button 213 is pressed, output 112 on microprocessor 65 sends out a signal which activates TRIAC 133 via photodiode 135. In the space of a few seconds, the safety lock on door 60 is activated, the lock detector switch closes causing diode 136 to activate photo transistor 138, and a signal is sent to connection 76 and, via gate 68, to microprocessor 65 which thus detects door 60 has been locked. Microprocessor 65 then sends out a signal from output 115, controls the coil on relay 141 and supplies voltage to the actuators, i.e. heating resistor 45, drain pump 47. electrovalves 49, 50, 51 and 52 and speed regulating block 41 of motor 42 which are activated according to the various cycle combination settings as described later.The three indicators showing the settings on groups 200, 201 and 202, the cycle start indicators 214 and the door 6Q lock indicator 203 activated by the signal on connection 76 , all stay on throughout the wash programme controlled by microprocessor 65. The wash stage indicators go off as each stage is performed only the ones relative to unperformed stages remaining on. Temperature and spinning speed indicators 207 and 208 go off at the end of their respective stages. At the end of the full programme, the signal from out put 112 on microprocessor 65 is cut off which opens TRIAL 133 and de activates the lock device on door 60.After a given length of time, i.e. a few tens of seconds, the lock device on the door opens, followed by the microswitch connected to diode 136, which cuts off the signal to connection 76 to in dicate the door has been released. Indicators 203 and 214 go off and end of cycle indicator 212 comes on. At the end of the washing operation, therefore, only indicator 212 and those on groups 200. 201 and 202 showing the initial settings are left on.At this point, the operator can choose between turning the machine off by means of switch 20 this opens switch 21 to cut off supply to wires 23 and 24 and closes switch 22 which discharges condenser 104 and cuts off supply to memory block 96 repeating the wash cycle by pressing button 216 pressing button 215 to cancel all the previous data and setting a new wash cycle as described for button groups 200, 201 and 202.Before pressing cycle start button 213, it is possible to aster the temperature setting downwards and the spin setting up or down . These are set automatically by the programme on microprocessor 65 and indicated by lights 207 and 208. Both changes are made by pressing buttons 210 and 211 respectively until the required setting is obtained.Button 216, on the other hand, can be pressed repeatedly for skipping a number of wash cycles. After cycle start button 213 has been pressed, the appliance receives no instruction other than that of stop button 215. The stop condition produced by pressing button 215 is displayed by cycle start but ton 214 flashing. In the stop condition, diode 135 controllingTRIAC 133 on the door 60 lock device is de activated but only if the water in the machine is below a given level indicated by switch 39. Indicator 203 stays on until door 60 is actually released a few tens of seconds later.provision is also made on the appliance for indicating various types of operating faults. As already mentioned, no water in the tub is indicated by switch 39. When off, indicator 203 shows door 60 may be opened and, when on lashing , that the door must be closed. Pressing cycle start button 213. even with door 60 open, activates TRIAC 133 which, in turn, acti vates the safety lock on door 60 after a few seconds. When the microswitch connected to diode 136 closes, a general con sent signal for performing all the operating stages is pro duced on connection 76 and indicator light 203 comes on permanently.If the microswitch is still open, however, light 203, which was previously off, starts flashing after, say, 15 seconds and all that is needed is to close door 60 to start the machine.Design of the present invention also provides for various diagnostic operations on the appliance an automatic diagnosis, each time on off switch 20 is turned on, makes a quick check of microprocessor 65 and all the indicators 32 and actuators 49, 50, 51, 52, 47, 45, 60 . It also performs a continuous automatic diagnosis throughout the rash cycle and any faults are indicated by light 218 coming on. The type of fault is also detected and memorised for fast diagnosis by a repair technician. Microprocessor 65 detects any overfilling, overdraining or overheating and causes the corresponding indicators 32 to start flashing. In the event of a fault on any of the actuators, a special combination of indicators 32 lights up to show the type of fault involved as described in detail later on. with reference to Fig. 5, a detailed description will now be given of the machine operating cycle with reference to different operating blocks. Block 300 diagnoses the condition of the fixed ROM memory block on microprocessor 65 by making a calculation of the 2048 bytes, considered as binary numbers, in the ROM memory. This should give a known result which is checked by block 301. If the result is wrong, microprocessor 65 is sent to a closed error cycle with no signal being given as it would be dangerous to use microprocessor 65 while it is out of order. If the result is correct, block 302 reads the condition of memory block 96 to ascertain whether supply has been caused by activating on off switch 20 or restored after a mains power cut.In the first case, switch 22 was closed and discharging condenser 104 so that the content of memory block 96 will be haphazard. In the second temporary power failure , since switch 22 is open, the content of memory block 96 is valid in that it has been kept supplied with voltage from condenser 104. Microprocessor 65, in fact, loads memory block 96 with codes relative to data to be preserved in the event of a power cut, e.g. wash phases already performed and which must not be repeated after power supply is restored and any faults on the machine. Memory block 96 is loaded whenever the data is available, though this may only be done when it is certain supply voltage will not fall below a preset threshold before the loading operation has been finished.Via the signal supplied to input 90 on microprocessor 65, comparator 91 therefore enables loading if supply voltage is over a given threshold, esg. 12V, and disables it if voltage is below that threshold. In the event of a power cut, voltage does not fall instantly but takes a certain amount of time if the voltage detected by comparator 91 is equal to or over 12V, there is no doubt the loading operation can be completed before voltage falls so low as to endanger efficient circuit operation.Therefore, if the fall in voltage is not caused by a transpent variation but by a power cut on the mains, in addition to comparator 90 not enabling loading of memory block 96, the latter is controlled by circuit 101 to prevent any wrong data from being accepted, microprocessor 65 is zeroed and gate 99 cut off by controlling the coil on relay 141 which opens up supply to the various actuators.Memory block 96 contains six bytes, five for cycle data and one redundant, calculated as shown in Fig. 8. The bytes are numbered 6, 5 ....1 and briefly byte I 6, 5 1. Redun dancy is byte 6. This brings us to block 305 in which redundancy O, block 306 in which T 6 and block 307 in which an ACC accumulator register H O , i.e. 15 in hexadeci mal notation. If all six bytes read zero, which would happen if block 96 broke down, the function of block 307 is to prevent the content from being accepted as valid and which the check calculation would lead to believe.From block 307 we come to block 308, which loads into the ACC register the value determined by block 307 plus the value of the first byte, and to block 309 which performs the carry over function. This brings us to block 310 in which I I 1 and to block 311 which calculates whether I O. If it does not, we go back to block 308 to calculate it again and, when I O, on to block 312, in which the redundancy register ACO, and block 313 which enters the calculated redundancy value into byte 6 of block 96. Block 302 in Fig. 5 then picks up the six bytes from memory block 96 and makes a calculation of the first five which should work out equal to byte 6 read by block 96 if supply to the latter has not been cut off. The reading cycle is shown in Fig. 6 block 32O, in which I 5, goes on to block 307s , which operates like block 307, and from there to blocks 308 , 309 , 3102 and 311 which operate with blocks 308 302. 310 and 311 in Fig. 8. When T O, block 311 goes on to block 321 which calculates whether redundancy i.e. byte 6 ACC as calculated. If it does not, this means the content of memory block 96 has been altered, i.e. switch 20 has been open ed for starting the cycle, which brings us to block 322 which loads the idle condition into one of the bytes containing the status of microprocessor 65. This brings us to block 323 which checks whether the machine is in an error condition determined by the operating block in pig. 7, as described later. If the check made by block 321 is affirmative, however, this means the content of memory block 96 has not been altered, i.e.voltage supply has been restored after a mains power cut, and we move directly on to block 323. This checks whether the machine status byte indicates an error condition. If it does, this means the machine was already in the error condition before supply was cut off and we move on to block 324 which activates error cause indicators 32, as described later on, and sends microprocessor 65 into a closed error cycle. If, on the other hand, the block 323 check is negative, i.eP the machine is not in an error condition, we move on to block 326 which enables a continuous diagnostic cycle of the actuators, as described later on with reference to Fig. 7. From block 326 we come to block 327 which checks whether the machine is in the idle condition.If it is, which means the start of a normaW cycle by activating switch 20J we come to block 328 which diagnoses the efficiency of indicators 32. Six bytes of theRAM memory block inside microprocessor 65 are, in fact, for indicators 32. The interrupt subprogramme generated by the timer inside microprocessor 65 every 2 milliseconds refreshes tEDs 32 which are piloted in cycles byte by byte, each byte lasting 2 milliseconds. For diagnosing tEDs 32, block 328 makes each bit of the six bytes equal to logic level 1 and counts off the time tEDs 32 are to be kept on by means of a count cycle. For this length of time, the interrupt subpro gramme turns all the tEDs on. If any are faulty and fail to tome on, this is detected by the operator an important point which also involves other indications. At the end of the set time, block 328 zeroes the six bytes of the RAM memory block on microprocessor 65 used for L Ds 32.This brings us to block 329 which determines on microprocessor 65 the wash programme selection made by the operator using button groups 200, 201 and 202, as already described. This brings us to block 330 which provides for establishing the starting point of the programme, by means of button 213, or jumping phases by means of button 216 as already described.This brings us to block 331, which determines the start of the wash programme by means of the consent signals already men tioned, e.g. door 60 close consent signal, and block 332 which, depending on the instructions contained in the microprocessor 65 memories, determines performance of the various wash cycles.If, on the other hand, the check made by block 327 proves negative, this means operation has been resumed after a temporary power cut prior to which the machine was performing a correct wash programme. This therefore brings us to block 335, which calls up the data contained in the memory block 96 bytes relative to the wash programme status prior to the power cut, and to block 331 which takes the wash programme up from the condition detected by block 96.The continuous diagnosis of actuator status, performed by enabling block 326, is performed during the microprocessor 65 interrupt controlled by the timer inside. Continuous automatic diagnosis was set at a rate of 48 milliseconds, its efficiency depending on reliable signal return circuits which reproduce the YES or NO conduction status of the actuators.The time of 48 milliseconds is such that the transistors on the actuators switching to conductive or idle status can safe ly be run down.As described in detail later on, in the auto diasnosis con dition, microprocessor 65 compares the group of signals from outputs 111, 112, 113 and 114 controlling electrovalves A9w 50, 51 and 52 respectively, the door 60 safety lock, drain pump 47 and heating resistor 45 with signals 761 , 76 , 76 and 76 detecting actual operation of the actuators. For heating resistor 45, the operation detector circuit utilizes switch contact 152 on relay 151. The return signal on wire 76 is at logic level O or 1 respectively if resistor 45 is supplied or not. Reliability of the data on connection 76 depends on reliable operation of relay 151 controlling direct supply to resistor 45.The status of door 60 is diagnosed using the contact connected to diode 136 which is closed by the electromechanical lock device supplied via TRIAC 133.For electrovalves 49, 50, 51 and 52 and drain pump 46, which are low power actuators, the diagnostic signals on connections 76 and 76 respectively detect the flow of current to the actuators directly.Fig. 3 shows two similar circuits. The one with diode bridge 142 is for detecting operation of pump 47 and the one with diode bridge 143 for detecting operation of any one of electrovalves 49, 50, 51 and. 52 which only operate one at a time.Resistors 180 and 181 provide for reconciling the maximum cur rent allowed on diode 182 with the maximum a.c. current on the actuator. As the current in diode bridge 142 or 143 is a pulsating current, an integrator is provided downstream from phototransistor 183, consisting of resistor 184 and group 186.When drain pump 47 and the electrovalves are activated, the logic signal at the output of comparator 185 or 185 switches to 0. Resistor 184, together with group 185, ensures that the voltage at the inverting input of threshold comparator 185 falls below the preset threshold within a maximum time of less than 48 milliseconds after the actuator ceases to be supplied, after which the signal on connection 76 or 76 switches to logic level 1.The actuators are piloted by microprocessor 65 via outputs 141, 112, 115. 113 and 114. Relay 14i is closed after the door 60 lock detector signal on connection 76 is received and opened, before the door is opened, by removing the signal on connection 112 for diode 135. At a rate of 48 milli seconds, the diagnostic signals on line 76, which are now operating steadily as regards the actuator controls received 48 milliseconds before, are compared with the actuator controls still present at one of the output gates on microprocessor 65.For controlling resistor 45, electrovalves 49, 50. 51 and 52 and drain pump 47, the pilot signals at the output of microprocessor 65 and the actuation status detected by line 76 must be the same, that is, if a close control has been sent out, the diagnostic status on line 76 must indicate a current flow or no current if an opening control has been sent out.For controlling door 60, a comparison is made of the close control received by relay 141 from output 115 on microprocessor 65 and the diagnostic signal on connection 76 indicat ing the status of door 60. The reason for this is that door 60 is locked and released only very slowly by TRIAC 133. Furthermore, only the condition is examined if relay 141 is closed, door 60 must be locked.The faults which can be detected on the appliance are of two types 1 One of the actuators, instead of being inactive, is active the control element TRIAC or relay is short circuited 2 zOne of the actuators, instead of being active, is inactive the control element is cut off.Only control 2 applies to door 60.The structure of the PLTG byte in the RAM on microprocessor 65, which is sent out from a gate on microprocessor 65 itself, consists of 8 bits of which the first 4 are for controlling the four electrovalves 49, 50, 51, 52 , the fifth for controlling door 60, the sixth for controlling drain pump 47, the seventh for controlling heating resistor 45 and the eighth for controlling sectioning relay 14 The diagnostic signals entering microprocessor 65 are described in the DIAGN byte in the RAM memory on microprocessor 65 itself. Structurally, it consists of 8 bits of which the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth are for the signals on connections 76 electrovalves , 76 pump , 76 heating resistor and 76 door . The diagnostic signals obtained from the arrangement in Fig. 3 indicate the opposite status of the actuators for which they must all be inverted for the bits of the PLOTZ byte to equal those of the DIAGN byte. Consequently, the bits of the DIAGN byte are at O if the actuator is not supplied and at 1 if it is.Fig. 7 shows the diagnostic programme performed every 48 inilli seconds. Block 400 checks whether at least one of the first 4 bits in the PLTG byte is equal to 1, that is, whether at least one of the electrovalves is activated. If it is, we move on to block 401 which makes the fourth bit in the PLTG byte equal to 1. If it is not, we move on to block 402 which makes the fourth bit in the PLTG byte equal to O. At this point, the individual pilot bits of the PLTG byte are aligned with the relative bits of diagnostic signal DIAGN byte. Both block 401 and 402 therefore bring us to block 403 which makes a bit by bit comparison of the DIAGN and PLTG bytes.This is done by means of an exclusive OR X OR function which is 1 if the two bits are different and O if they are the same.The result of the operation remains in the DIGN byte. This brings us to block 404 which checks to see whether the eighth bit in the PLTG byte is equal to 0. If it is not, i.e. door 60 is closed, we move on to block 405. If it is, we move on to block 406 which makes the eighth bit of the DIAGN byte equal to 0, i.e. if sectioning relay 141 is open, the diagnosis is suspended on the status of door 60.From block 406, we move on to block 405, just as we did directly from block 404, where a check is made to see whether all of the last four bits in the DIAGN byte are equal to 0, i.e. detected actuator status tallies with hou they are being piloted. if it does, this means there are no errors if it does not, this means there is at least one error, i.e. one of the actuators is not operating according to the instruc tions it has received. This brings us to block 408 which trans fers the four bits 4 to 7 of the DIAGN byte into the first four bits 0 to 3 of the PLTG byte.The seven bits Co to 6 of the PLTG byte therefore represent the error code the tbfee from 4 to 6 show how the actuators have been piloted while the four from O to 3 show the differences that have been detected see the Table below BIT 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0PLTG Piloting Differences Electrovaives 49,50,51,52 TRIAC 170 CTO CTO O TRIAC 170 INTERR 1PUMP 47 TRIAC 160 CTO CTO O TRIAC 160 INTERR 1RESISTANCE 45 PIL. RELAY 151 CTO CTO O 1PIL. RELAY 151 INTERR. 1 1DOOR 60 RELEASED 1 SECT.RELAY 141 closed with at least one of the actuators in an error condition such as this, block 408 brings us to block 410 one section of which 411 uses the bits of the PLTG byte to light indicators 32 in a given combination provided for in the above logic signal table and give an accurate indication of the fault which is deciphered via decoding means, e.g. over the control panel on the appliance. A second section 412 memorises the error status and the error code contained in the PLTG byte in memory block 96 supplied by condenser 1C4. A third section 413 close circuits the main programme on microprocessor 65 while a fourth 414 opens power supply relay 141.The machine therefore stops with the error status indicated in memory block 96 and the type of error displayed by indicators 32.If the machine is turned off by activating switch 20, the technician may activate switch 38 to put the actuators through a quick no load cycle and so find the error indication and error type display.The advantages of the present invention will be clear from the description given, in particular, the provision of automatic, continuous self diagnosis of actuator operation electrovalves, drain pump, heating resistor, door lock with a high degree of reliability afforded by the fact that actuator operation is controlled by detecting operation of an electric signal on the actuators themselves and not by detecting a control signal on the microprocessor. On the electrovalves, it is the control signal sent directly to them that is detected via photodiode 182 i on drain pump 47, it is the operating signal that is detected by photodiode 182 on heating resistor 45, it is the position of activating relay 151 that is detected by photodiode 153 and, on door 60, it is actual locking of the door that is detected by photodiode 136.The type of fault on the actuator is shown by a convenient combination of indicators 32 the efficiency òf which is checked by the appliance at the start of the operating cycle. The error status and code of one or more of the actuators are memorised in memory block 96 and preserved even in the event of a power cut. When power supply is restored, microprocessor 63 checks to see whether an error status was previously stored in block 96. Even in the event of a power cut under normal operating conditions, the operating status of the appliance,determined, for example, by the bits in the PLTG byte, is memorised in memory block 96 so that the operating cycle may be taken up again from where it was left off. To those skilled in the art it will be clear that changes may be made to the appliance described by way of a non limit ing example, without, however, departing from the scope of the present invention.For example, the household appliance in question, instead of being a washing machine, may be a ishXwashing machine or any other appliance on which a number of actuators are activated according to given sequence combinations determined by a control microprocessor.
