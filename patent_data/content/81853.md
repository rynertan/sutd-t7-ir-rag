# Conjugates of anticoagulant and protein.

## Abstract
Conjugates are provided which are covalently bonded conjugates of an anticoagulant and protein that are prepared in the presence of a coupling agent that forms amide linkages between the anticoagulant and the protein. Such amide linking coupling agents exclude highly toxic coupling agents such as CNBr. These conjugates are useful for enhancing the blood compatibility of certain surfaces of a prosthetic device, a surgical apparatus, or an extra corporeal medical device.
