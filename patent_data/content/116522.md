# A device for visually displaying alphanumeric characters, particularly in motor vehicles.

## Abstract
A device for visually displaying alphanumeric characters by means of segments which are individually and selectively switchable between two operating states, one of which corresponds to visual perceptability of the segments them selves. The segments are arranged in identical, adjacent groups forming a repeating structure, each group com prising first segments 10 14 together defining a main con figuration including two quadrilateral shaped spaces arranged one above the other and open on their right hand sides, second segments defining first 15 and second 16,17,18 subsidiary configurations disposed respectively at the lower left hand corner, and the upper left hand corner of the main configuration and each including a segment 15, 16 which extends substantially vertically from a respective corner of the main configuration itself the second subsidiary configuration further including a horizontal segment 17 which extends towards right as an extension of the substan tially vertical segment 16 and a corner segment 18 occupying the corner position of the second configuration itself, two third segments 19, 20 one 19 of which occupies the upper left hand portion of the lower quadrilateral shaped space of the main configuration, and the other 20 of which is located below the lower right hand corner of the main configuration, in a position substantially horizontally aligned with the lower end of the first subsidiary configuration 15 , and means 2 for selectively controlling the switching of each of the first 10 14 , second 15 18 and third 19, 20 segments into the said state of visual perceptability.
