# IMPROVEMENTS IN PACKAGING FILM DISPENSERS

## Abstract
A dispensing implement 10 for use in manually wrapping palleted loads with stretch film has a wheeled base 12, 14 on which a roll 11 of film is mounted for free rotation as film is drawn therefrom. The film leaving the roll 11 is taken in opposite directions in turn around two dispensing rollers 26, 28 mounted to turn on shafts 32 journalled between two yokes 30, 31 . The yokes, shafts and rollers are pivotable on a mounting tube 34 , so that as film is pulled from the apparatus, roller 26 is pressed against the supply roll 11 . A gear train 36 ensures that roller 28 rotates at a greater peripheral speed than the other roller 26 so that the film is stretched longitudinally between the rollers. At least roller 28 has a high friction, helical rib configuration on its surface which serves to stretch the film laterally as it passes over this roller 28 .
