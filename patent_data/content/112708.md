# FILM FORMING OLEFINIC NITRILE POLYMER LATEX AND METHOD OF PREPARING SAME

## Abstract
A stable aqueous latex of a copolymer containing at least 40 percent by weight of a polymerized olefinic unsaturated nitrile is described. The copolymer comprises a main polymer core of from 40 to 100 percent by weight of the polymerized nitrile and from 0 to 60 percent by weight of at least one other polymerized olefin monomer, said main polymer core being overpolymerized with a copolymer comprising a major propor tion of a polymerized acrylate in from one to 40 percent by weight of a polymerized olefinic unsaturated nitrile. A two step method for preparing such a latex also is described. The latices of the invention are useful in forming films at low temperatures, and the minimum film forming temperature can be regulated by the selection of the particular components and the relative amounts of the components used to form the latices.
