Another and further objects of the present invention are to provide processes for preparing bacterial cell products having liver function improving activities, i.e., activities that will reduce the serum GOT and GPT levels, and having blood pressure lowering activities in mammals, pharmaceutical preparations containing the bacterial cell products, and methods for lowering the serum GOT and GPT levels and the blood pressure in mammals. A still further object of the present invention is to provide a novel method to improve the liver function and to lower the blood pressure in mammals. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a process for preparing the bacterial cell products having activities that will reduce the serum GOT and GPT levels, and blood pressure lowering activities in mammals comprising the steps of cultivating microorganisms belonging to the genus In accordance with the present invention, there is also provided a pharmaceutical composition for lowering the serum GOT and GPT levels, and blood pressure of patients, comprising a preventive or therapeutically effective amount of living cells, dead cells, or a mixture thereof, of microorganisms belonging to the genus In accordance with the present invention, there is still further provided a method for lowering the serum GOT and GPT levels, and the blood pressure of mammals, comprising orally administering to mammals an effective amount of living cells, dead cells, or a mixture thereof, of a microorganism belonging to the genus The present invention will be better understood from the description set forth below with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which The present inventors have found that various living cells and dead cells of microorganisms belonging to the genus The types and the preparation methods of strains, and the pharmacological effects of the microorganisms according to the present invention will now be explained in detail. Microorganisms utilizable in the present invention belonging to the genus Typical examples of such microorganisms have been deposited since July 15, 1982 in the Fermentation Research Institute FRI in Japan all the numbers quoted as FERM P in Table 1 refer to the deposition numbers of said Institute and transferred to the Fermentation Research Institute FRI i.e., International Depository Authority under Budapest Treaty in Japan as the following FERM BP deposition numbers in Table 1 under Budapest Treaty on the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for the Purpose of Patent Procedure The microbiological characteristics of the microorganisms in the present invention are the same as those of known microorganisms belonging to the identical class. That is, the general microbiological characteristics, cultivation methods, and other properties correspond to those described in the following articles The typical microbiological characteristics of the above exemplified strains according to the present invention are summarized in Table 2. These microorganisms can be cultivated in a conventional manner. For example, the bacterial cells can be collected by stationary cultivation in a Rogosa broth medium Efthymiou, C., and Hausen, P.A. 1962 An antigenic analysis of The resultant cells can be directly used as a pharmaceutical agent in the form of living cells or dead cells obtained by, for example, heat treatment, or in the form of the cells destroyed by, for example, ultrasonic treatment. The term dead cells used herein means the entire portions or partial portions of the above mentioned destructed cells. The dead cells can be also used as a starting material for fractionating, extracting, and purifying active elements contained therein. This is because the desired pharmacological activities i.e., liver function improving and blood pressure lowering activities in mammals are based on substance components contained in the cells, and because not only the living cells but also the dead cells have these pharmacological activities. The living cells and dead cells of the microorganisms used in the present invention, suitable for use as a liver function improving agent and a blood pressure lowering agent, are typically prepared as follows As shown in the examples hereinbelow, as LD50 of the living cells according to the present invention is 8.9 x 10⁸ to 1.3 x 10¹⁰ cells mouse, intraperitoneally and that of the dead cells according to the present invention is more than 6 x 10¹¹ cells mouse, intraperitoneally. Both the living and dead cells according to the present invention are substantially nontoxic upon oral administration. The present inventicn will now be further shown by, but is by no means limited to, the following examples. The heat treated cell suspension of Venous blood was taken from the auricular vein of the animals at 6, 7, 8, and 9 weeks after the start of administration, and the serum GOT and GPT levels were determined by the GOT and GPT determination kits Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd. . The results of the GOT and GPT levels Karmen units are shown in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively. In the figures, the ordinate and abscissa indicate the GOT or GPT level Karmen units , and breeding period weeks after the start of administration, respectively, and A is the control group to which no sample and empty capsules were dosed, B is also a control group to which normal diet was administered, and C is an administration group with the heat treated cells 60 mg day . The diet CR 1 Clea Japan, Inc. was given to the group B and the groups A and C were given the diet CR 1 containing 0.2 of cholesterol. As is obvious from the figures, the administration of this agent according to the present invention keeps the GOT and GPT levels lower than 30 units, i.e., in the normal range. The freeze dried materials of the heat treated cell suspension of each microorganism belonging to the genus The serum GOT and GPT levels Karmen units were then determined by the same method as in Example 1 and the results were shown in Table 3. As is obvious from the table, the administration of this agent according to the present invention keeps the GOT and GPT levels at 20 40 units and 10 35 units, respectively. After the preliminary breeding of conventional rats Fischer 344, male, 5 week old, average body weight of 156 g, Clea Japan, Inc., 5 rats in each group on CE II Clea Japan, Inc. ad libitum for 2 weeks, drinking water was changed to 1 NaCl solution. When the rats were 8 week old, the freeze dried material of the heat treated cell suspension of The reduction rate was shown in Fig. 3. In the figure, the ordinate and abscissa indicate the reduction rate of blood pressure and administration period days , respectively, and D and E indicate the control and the administration group with the heat treated cells, respectively. As is obvious from the figure, the reduction rate of the blood pressure in the animals is about 10 by administration of this agent according to the present invention. The lyophilized materials of the heat treated cell suspension of each microorganism belonging to the genus As is obvious from the table, the reduction rate of the blood pressure in the animals is brought to 7 13 by the administration of this agent according to the present invention. Living cells of bacteria prepared according to the above mentioned living cell preparation method were intraperitoneally administered to ICR mice 6 week old males, average body weight of 30.0 0.7 g with 0.5 ml of a bacterial suspension containing 9 x 10⁹ 9 x 10⁸ and 9 x 10⁷ cells per mouse 10 mice in each group . Thanatobiologic observation of the mice was carried out for 14 days. The LD50 values viable cell number mouse calculated according to a Behrens Kärber method are shown in Table 5. In the case of the dead cells of the above mentioned strains according to the present invention, the LD50 values corresponded to more than 6 x 10¹¹ cells mouse intraperitoneal dosage . Both the living and dead cells of the above mentioned strains according to the present invention were nontoxic in the case of oral administration. Thus, the cell products of the present invention can be converted into the desired dosage form having a predetermined activity by mixing with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers based on the above mentioned standard dosage.
