# Reversible motor.

## Abstract
A reversible linear motor has a coil arrangement 11 arranged alongside a conductive body such as a rotatable aluminum disc 6 . The coil arrangement 11 is made up of three separate coils namely an inner coil 13 and two inter connected outer coils 12, 14 on opposite sides of the inner coil 13 . The coils 12, 13, 14 are connected to a single phase a.c. supply L,N and the drive of the disc 6 can be reversed by reversing the connection of the inner coil 13 relative to the two outer coils 12, 14 . The linear motor may be used for driving a reel 1 of an entertainment machine of the fruit machine kind.
