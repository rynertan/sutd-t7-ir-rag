# SYRINGE FOR PRODUCING VACUUM CONTROLLED SUCTION

## Abstract
A syringe for producing controlled vacuum suction for medical purpose, particularly for suctional puncture cytolog ical studies, and optionally standard fluid injection functions like conventional syringes, of the general type comprising a cyl inder 1 finishing at the front end in a suction and or injection tube 2 designed for taking a corresponding needle, and in side the cylinder a plunger 3 which, when it is displaced in the cylinder on the up stroke, produces a vacuum, wherein the cyl inder and the plunger stem 5 are provided with supplemen tary means 6, 8 for mutual locking designed for simple, swift anchoring of this stem in respect of the cylinder so as to main tain a desired vacuum by preventing the plunger to move back to the front end of the cylinder while carrying out vacuum suc tion, said locking being simply releasable, at the user s dis cretion, so that the plunger returns to its initial position and cancels the vacuum.
