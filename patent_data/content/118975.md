## Description
BLISTER SHEET This invention relates to a blister sheet which is particularly applicable for packaging medicines in the form of capsules, tablets and the like. This type of sheet may, however, also be used when packing other articles which need to be sealed separately prior to use such as metal articles which are susceptible to corrosion. It is known in the art to package tablets using two sheets of aluminium foil. The tablets are located at spaced intervals between the sheets which are then staled together in such a way that each tablet is enclosed in an air and moisture proof space. Generally the metal foil is coated with polyethylene which acts as a hot melt adhesive to seal the two sheets together. However a bubble pack of this type requires expensive raw materials and is only suited to manufacture under factory conditions because of the specialised heat sealing equipment required. Another known sheet of this type is a blister sheet which consists of a polyvinyl chloride sheet which has been formed by heat and pressure into blisters. The articles to be packed are then placed in the blisters and a lidding sheet of aluminium foil applied over the flat surface of the blister sheet to seal the blisters. The lidding sheet is sealed to the blister sheet to form a pack by various means, for example a hot melt adhesive in a heat sealing process. Because of the nature of the pack and the manufacturing process, it is only practicable to manufacture such packs under factory conditions. As a result, the product is limited to the packaging of standard packs, for example aspirin tablets. It is an object, therefore, of the present inventIon to provide a blister pack which is cheap to produce and which overcomes, at least in part, the need to use expensive starting materials and specialised heat sealing equipment. It has now been found that a relatively inexpensive paper based packaging can be produced which not only enables articles, particularly drug tablets, to be packed in a factory, but which in certain circumstances can be used in shops. For example, it enables such tablets to be packed by a pharmacist in a shop or a hospital in a programmed dosage form. According to the present invention therefore, a blister sheet for use in a blister pack comprises a paper sheet which has been thermoformed to provide one or more blister cavities to receive articles to be packaged, said sheet being made from a blend of cellulosic and or staple fibres with thermoplastic polymer at least a portion or all of said thermoplastic polymer being fibrillated. Examples of thermoplastic polymer in the form of fibrillated fibres are those sold under the trade name SWP by Crown Zellerbach Corporation and the trade name PULPEX EA by Solvay et Cie. Preferably between 80 and 90 of the thermoplastic polymer is fibrillated. The exact proportion of fibrillated thermoplastic polymer desirable in the paper sheet will vary with the depth and configuration of the blister cavities to be formed. Preferably the thermoplastic polymer content is between 60 and 95 of the blend. Thus, the thermoplastic polymer content is preferably at least 75 and where high translucency is required about 85 of the blend. The sheet may also include coloured or white pigments such as titanium dioxide to confer opacity and resistance to ultra violet light. The titanium dioxide content should not exceed 20 and for such a proportion of the loading, the thermoplastic polymer content should not be less than 75 The fibrillated thermoplastic polymer material may, for example, be constituted by a polyolefin such as polyethylene or polypropylene. Particulate thermoplastic polymer material may be included to supplement the fibrillated thermoplastic polymer material. Examples of cellulosic and staple fibres which may be used are bleached or unbleached softwood and hardwood sulphite and sulphate pulps, cotton linters and rayon and polyester staple fibres. Of these hardwood sulphate pulp is especially preferred as conferring good thermoformability whilst providing low permeability in the thermofor l√¨ec sheet. As a lidding for the blister sheet, conventional aluminium foil may be used or a paper lidding may be provided. Papers such as glassine, greaseproof, tracing or vegetable parchment, which have high burst and low tear resistance characteristics are also appropriate for use as lidding materials. The paper lidding may also comprise a mixture of thermplastlc material and cellulose fibres in a ratio of, for example 75 thermoplastic to 25 cellulose. According to another feature of the present invention the blister sheet may be as set forth above and be formed with a fold line so as to divide it into first and second portions, said first portion having blister cavities formed therein for receiving articl es to be packaged so that when articles are located in said cavities the second portion can be folded along said fold line to provide a lidding sheet which can be adhered to said first portion to form a blister pack separately enclosing said articles. If desired the said second portion may also be provided with blister cavities which are spaced on said sheet to coincide with said blister cavities on said first portion when the sheet is folded. Adhesion is preferably achieved by means of a high tack dry latex adhesive which coats sufficient of the planar surfaces of the sheet to ensure that after a lidding sheet has been applied the blisters are isolated from each other and the atmosphere. A layer of such adhesive will only adhere to another layer of the same adhesive, thus obviating the need to provide protective release sheets. Alternatively the high tack dry latex adhesive may be substituted by other self adhesives, in which case release sheets, coated for example with silicone release coatings, will be applied to the adhesive coatings as a protection. These release sheets will have apertures which coincide with the moulded recesses of the sheet so that only areas coated with adhcsive will be covered by the release sheet. The release sheets will then be stripped off before the sheet is used to form a blister pack. This pack does not require any machinery or factory conditions for assembly and may be easily used by the pharmacist when packing prescribed medicines in his shop. The self adhesives used may be of any well known kind. Commonly such adhesives are based on natural rubber, styrene butadiene rubber, butyl rubber or polyisobutene as backbone polymers modified with suitable tackifiers and plasticizers. Further alternative adhesives which may be used are heat activated adhesives which may be of any well known kind and for example comprise sealing wax, polyvinylidenedi chloride, polyethy 2ne or a hot Iiiclt adhesive consistin of 30 w w ethyl vinyl acetate, 20 w w tackifying resin and 400 w w paraffin wax. The thermoplastic content of the sheet of the invention also renders it heat sealable to an appropriate lidding without the use of an adhesive. However special heat sealing machinery is required in both cases and this sealing method would not therefore be suitable for use by the pharmacist. Adhesive may be applied as appropriate to facilitate adhesion. However the invention is not limited to the use of any particular adhesives and the foregoing merely constitute examples of types of adhesive which may be used.The blister pack may also be provided without adhesive thus allowing the pharmacist to apply his own as necessary, If the articles to be packed are likely to be subjected to hygroscopic or ultra violet degradation then the sheet used may also incorporate a metal layer provided by vacuum deposition and will generally be of aluminiumAlternately or in addition an ultra violet absorber such as titanium dioxide either in the body of the sheet or as a coating can be included. Titanium dioxide also confers opacity on the sheet. Opacity may also be provided by the use of other coatings, for example, white or tinted inks. The sheet could also be provided with detachment means in the form of perforations which extend between the sealed blisters so that the patient is able to easily detach each dose in a separate blister. Alternatively weakened lines could be provided by thermoforming or mechanical composition. The invention further comprises a blister pack formed using blister sheets as above referred to. The invention will be further described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure l is a cross sectional view of a blister pack embodying a blister sheet according to the invention Figure 2 is a cross sectional view on the line II II of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a cross sectional view through a blister pack including a second embodiment of a blister sheet according to the invention which is suitable for use with tablets susceptible to hygroscopic or ultra violet degeneration Figure 4 is a cross sectional view of a third embodi ment of packaging element iron which a blister yack can be formed. Figure 5 is a cross sectional view of a blister pack formed from the sheet of Figure 4 Figure 6 is a cross sectional view of a fourth embodi ment of packaging element from which a blister pack can be formed Figure 7 is a cross sectional view of a blister pack formed from the sheet of Figure 6 Figure 8 is a cross sectional view of a blister pack formed from a fifth embodiment of packaging element according to the invention. In the construction shown in Figures 1 and 2 a blister sheet 1 is made from a mixture of cellulosic and fibrillated synthetic thermoplastic fibres. The synthetic fibres used are those sold under the Trade name SWP byCrown Zellerbach Corporation. The proportion of fibrillated thermoplastic polymer desirable in the paper sheet will vary with the depth and configuration of the blister cavities to be formed. The thermoplastic polymer therefore is between 75 and 80 and is made up from approximately 75 fibrillated fibres and 25 particulate material. The remainder of the blend comprises the cellulosic and staple fibre material and this can be hardwood sulphate pulp, In order to provide opacity to the sheet a proportion of pigment such as titanium dioxide is also included. An alternative blend of materials suitable for the construction shown in Figures 1 and 2 comprises a blend of synthetic thermoplastic fibre material of the kind sold under the trade name PULPEX EA by Solvay et Cie. In this blend high translucency is achieved by including thermoplastic polymer amounting to about 85 of the blend, the remainder again being hardwood sulphate pulp. Once again with this embodiment at least 60S of the thermoplastic polymer is in fibrillated form, the remainder being particulate. The sheet may be formed on a conventional papermaking machine and when it it to be made up into a blister sheet it is moulded by thermal deformation to provide blisters 2.The blister sheet 1 has coated thereon a layer of high tack dry latex adhesive 3 and contains within its blisters 3 drug tablets 4. A lidding sheet 5 carries thereon a layer 6 of the same high tack dry latex adhesive. The adhesive layers 3 and 6 are mutually adhesive but will not adhere to any other surface. They are sealed together at the locations 7 between the blisters so that each tablet 4 is isolated The lidding sheet 5 is made of paper, and preferably of a paper having high burst and low tear resistance characteristics. This ensures that inadvertent rupture of the lidding sheet is minimised whilst ensuring that after intentional rupture, it will tear easily to release a selected tablet.Such papers are exemplified by glassine, greaseproof, tracing and vegetable parchment papers, burst and tear characteristics for which are set out in the following table EMI9.1 PAPER SEP COATED SEP VEGETABLE tb GLASSINE SEP GREASEPROOF SEP PARCHMENT tb TYPE SEP AS SEP HEREIN SEP DEFINED tb UNITS tb GRAMMAGE tb grams SEP per tb square SEP metre SEP 68 SEP 39 SEP 54 SEP 51 SEP 40 tb gm m2 tb BRITISH SEP Kilo SEP Newtons SEP 138 SEP 104 SEP 163 SEP 139 SEP 130 tb BURST tb STANDARD SEP per SEP square tb TEST SEP metre tb METHOD SEP Kn m2 tb 3137 1972 tb BURST SEP 2.0 SEP 2.7 SEP 3.0 SEP 2.7 SEP 3.3 tb FACTOR tb BRITISH SEP MACHINE SEP Milli SEP 240 SEP 100 SEP 130 SEP 135 SEP 120 tb STANDARD SEP DIRECTION SEP Newtons tb TEST SEP TEAR SEP mN tb METHOD SEP RESISTANCE tb 4468 1969 tb TEAR SEP 357.9 SEP 239.9 SEP 263.7 SEP 257.7 SEP 304.6 tb FACTOR tb BRITISH SEP CROSS SEP Milli SEP 280 SEP 120 SEP 160 SEP 180 SEP 120 tb STANDARD SEP DIRECTION SEP Newtons tb TEST SEP TEAR SEP mN tb METHOD SEP RESTSTANCE tb 4468 1969 tb TEAR SEP 410.6 SEP 309.3 SEP 295.2 SEP 351.6 SEP 304.6 tb FACTOR tb In the foregoing embodiment, the use of layers of mutually adherent tack dry latex adhesive has been pro osed. However, it will be appreciated that self adhesive layers may be readily substituted, in which case, release sheets, coated for example with silicone release coatings will be applied to the adhesive coatings as a protection, the release sheets being stripped off before the blister and lidding sheets are sealed together. Alternatively, where the lidding sheet is to be sealed to a blister sheet comprising thermoplastic material, such as polyvinyl chloride or polyethylene, it may carry a layer of heat seal adhesive.In this case, the lidding sheet will be sealed to the blister sheet by appropriate heat sealing equipment Referring now to Figure 3, this shows a modification of the embodiment of Figures 1 and 2 particularly suited for packing articles 10 which are susceptible to ultra violet and or hygroscopic degeneration. The constructio and assembly of the blister pack is generall as aescrib d above with reference to Figures 1 and 2 and where appropriate, the various parts are designated by the same reference numerals. In this case however the outer surfaces of the blister and lidding sheets 1 and 5 are provided with metal layers in 11 and 12 respectively. The metal layers are provided by vacuum deposition, for example of aluminium. The provision of a metal layer has a further advantage in that it renders both the blister pack and lidding sheet opaque and thus conceals the contents from children who might otherwise identify them as sweets or candies. In Figure 4 a sheet 21 is shown which may optionally carry printed materials and is mad from a blend of cellulose and synthetic fibres together with suitable known binders. The sheet 21 is also coated with a cold seal adhesive 24. The sheet is moulded, for example by thermal deformation to provide blisters 22, being divided into first and second portions by a fold line 23. Capsules or the like 25 are placed in the blisters so that when the sheet is folded about the fold line 23 as indicated by the arrow X the second portion acts as a lidding sheet and the capsules become sealed in a blister. Information such as names, dates or dosage may be manually applied on the flat surface 26 at this stage. In Figure 5 the sheet 21 of Figure 4 is shown after folding along the fold line 23. The cold seal adhesive 24 seals the capsules into the blisters to form a blister pack. Referring now to the embodiment of Figure 6 the sheet 21 has blisters 22 spaced from either side of the fold line 23 so that on folding as indicated by the arrow X, the recessed areas in one portion coincide with the blisters in the other portion. In Figure 7 the sheet 21 of the second embodiment is shon.after folding along fold line 23 in direction X.As, before, sealing is effected by the cold seal adhesive 24, and the second portion again acting as a lidding sheet. In the embodiment of Figure 8 the sheet 21 has been provided with a metal surface layer 27 by vacuum metallization. Apart from this the construction is the same as that shown in Figure 5 and is particularly suitable for packing articles which are susceptible to hygroscopic or ultraviolet degradation. This metal layer is provided by vacuum deposition of aluminium after the sheet has been formed. it will be appreciated that each of the foregoingFigures shows only part of a sheet which will be covered with a large nuinbcr of recessed areas.
