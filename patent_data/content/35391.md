# Multi frequency eddy current test apparatus and method.

## Abstract
Four different test frequencies are sequentially applied to search coils 11 and 12 from amplifier 13. Differential output signal from bridge 16, 17, 11, 12 is passed by transformer 19 to choppers 36 and 37 operating at an intermediate frequency and in phase quadrature. Modulators 33 and 34 multiply respective chopper outputs by an in phase square wave at the test frequency. Outputs from the two modulators pass to a tank circuit 32 which produces a vector summation of the intermediate frequency components. A multiplexer 46 controlled by frequency indicators M1 to M4 sequentially removes the IF signals and applies them to phase sensitive detectors 49 to produce Fourier amplitude components A1, B1 etc. An absolute output from transformer 22 in a bridge circuit 11, 16, 23, 24 passes through a parallel channel with a duplicate of the differential channel circuitry.
