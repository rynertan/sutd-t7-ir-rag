# Method of and apparatus for detecting ends of successive fly strips connected by a slide fastener chain.

## Abstract
A method of and apparatus 11 for detecting ends of successive fly strips 1 connected end to end by a slide fastener chain 2 , 3 . The successive fly strips 1 , with their first flaps 8 superimposed on a tape 5 of one fastener stringer 2 and with their second flaps 9 superimposed on the other fastener stringer 3 , are fed along a first straight path 13 . The successive second flaps 9 are deflected or moved aside, as they pass a wedge shaped plow 21 , 30 on the first straight path 13 , to such an extent that the individual second flap 9 lies at a right angle with respect to the general plane of the fastener stringers 2 , 3 . Then, the direction of movement of the successive fly strips 1 is shifted at a turning point 15 to a second straight path 14 inclined with respect to the first straight path 13 so as to provide a relatively large triangular space 16 between an adjacent pair of the deflected second flaps 9 , 9 temporarily when the same confronting ends 9a , 9b arrive at the turning point 15 . Finally, a detector 17 senses the presence of the triangular space 16 , which indicates the arrival of confronting ends of an adjacent pair of the fly strips 1 , 1 .
