## Description
Cheese flavored confection composition and process for its preparation The present invention relates to the art of confectionary compositions, and, in particular, to those compositions having a cheese flavor. As a result of continuing efforts in the confectionary industry to provide the consumer with unique, attractive confectionary products, attention has been given to this development of snack like cheese products. To this end several methods for making snack sized cheese products have been developed. For example, such production methods are disclosed in U.S.Patent No. 3,761, 284 and U.S. Patent No. 3,966, 970 corresponding to Japanese Patent Publication laid open to the public under No. 155384 and claiming te Convention priority thereof . The primary object of this prior art is to provide snacksized cheese products having a cylinrical shape. In the U.S. Patent No.3,761, 284, a molten Cheese is cooled to a temperature varying about 20 to 30 C. and formed into a rope and then cut into desired length to obtain snack sized pieces. Thereafter, each piece is quickly cooled and wrapped. U.S. Patent No. 3,966,970 discloses a high spead cutting of a quickly cooled cheese rope into individual pieces and a twist wrapping thereof for improving the efficiency in manufacturing the snack sized cheese products. Although these prior art. methods permit the provision of bite sized pieces of a cheese product convenient to the consumer, the resultant shape of the product is inevitably limited to the shape obtained by the step of cutting the rope.Accordingly, the possible variations in the shape of the product according to the conventional arts are restricted to the varieties obtained by changing the sectional shape of the rope. In order to overcome such shortcoming, U.S. Patent No. 4,299,855 to Wada, et al. shows a method of morning a snack sized cheese products into a desirable rounded shape such as a sphere, ellipsoid, and or a barrel shape by cooling a molten cheese to a temperature range of about 450C. to 350C. heating a surface area of the cooled cheese to a terperature of about 52 C. to 39 C. cutting the heated cheese into snack sized pieces of cheese and forming each of the snack swzed pieces by continuous rolling within a mold die for forming into a rounded shape without corners.By way of example, a cheese composition useful in the Wada, et al. process includes about 80 of Gouda cheese, 20 of Cheddar cheese, 2 of Hexametaphosphate, and 0. 6 of neutraZizer, Other efforts in the area of cheese confections have ben directed to providing compositions which have characteristics suitable for specific purposes. U.S.Patent No. 3,814,825 to Gilmartin Jr., et al. discloses a chunked synthetic cheese product produced by providing a heated1 molten body of edible fat to which is added a finely comminuted cheese flavored dry material. The admixture is then cooled to a tem.perature below about 32 C 900F before chunking and dusting to prevent coagulation. According to Gilmartin, et al. the edible fat is a molten blend of hard and soft fats. The amount of fat useful to forn the cheese product is within a range of 35 95 weight percent of te dry material Col.2, lines 3 5 , and included within the preferred cheese material which can be used is spray dried cheese material which, in turn, can include r .ilk solids Col.2, lines 39 49 . . According to Gilmartin, et al. the edible fat is a molten blend of hard and soft fats, a hard fat characterized by a melting point between about 320C and 609C 900F and 1400F . In U.S. patent No. 4,198,439 to hoover a nut cheese product is shown which includes a homogeneous blend of 50 to 8Q percent by weight of ground roasted nuts, 10 to 40 percent dehydrated cheese material, and 5 to 15 percent of a texture modifying agent comprising hydrogenated and non hydrogenated fats, glycerides, and mixtures thereof. U.S. Patent No. 3,843,808 toZiccarelli shows a shelf stable dry cheese solids CompOsition which includes finely dispersed fat particles, having a melting point of 32 510C 90 1240F ,enrobed in a fat enrobing agent such as codried dried yeast to prevent coalescing of the fat particles. U,S.PatentNo. 2,278,202 to Musher describes a cheese composition which includes a grated hard cheese such as Parmesan,Parmesello, American, and Edam combined with a molten hard fat so that substantially all of the particles of the grated cheese are coated with the molten hard fat. Thereafter, the hard fat is allowed to congeal thereon.U.S. Patent No, 2,015,256 to Clickner discloses a dried cheese combined with a fat which is solid at room temperature which may be used as a coating. Further disclosures, such as U.S. Patent No. 4,254,156 to DeSocio, et al., describe an imitation cheese base which simulates the consistency, feel and texture of a cheese cake filling prepared by mixing a cooled gelled custard, a solution of gelatin, a dry mix of starch and sugars and a vegetable oil based imitation cheese to form a chilled slurry which is aerated to give the mass a cellular structure retained for an extended period of time. U.S.Patent No. 4,032,669 to Peters, et al. describes a cheese product in the form of chunks or crumble like particles, i.e., nuggets , which is made by combining a natural cheese constituent i.e., not one which has been drastically altered by, for example, spray drying , with two gelling additives, Xanthomonas colloids and locust bean gum, and casein or an edible casvinate salt. This mixture is then chilled to induce formation of a gel matrix, followed by comminuting the solid product, as required, to the desired particle size, Finally, U.S. Patent No. 1,735,510 to Shostak discloses a food product which is produced by mixing elted cheese and nelted chocolate. In none of the relevant disclosures knon to date, however, there has been described a cheese confection composition capable of being formed as a confection unit or as a coating which composition has smooth chocolate like texture. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide, among other things, such a composition which is useful as a confectionary. fn accordance with the present invention there is provided a shelf stable cheese confection composition rewiring no refrigeration having a smooth chocolate like texture which is capable of forming a confectionary unit, coating, etc. The present cheese avored composition includes as much as 20 408 by weight of a powdered dry cheese and cry mlk in combination with a fat which softens at a temperature of between about 26 and 43 C 80 F. and 110 F. .In order to properly effect the desired composition, the powdered dry cheese, preferably having no more than about 5 by weight of moisture, is blended with the dry milk after which the resulting blend is processed with the melted fat in order to break down the cheese particles while simultaneously forcibly coating the cheese particles with the fat. It is preferred to use a three or five roll mill for such processing and to include a dispersing agent such as lecithin to insure proper covering of the fat over the cheese particles. The overall content of moisture in the end product should not contain more tan about 58 by weight of moisture. Preferably the powdered dry cheese includes aged cheese solids and is present in an amount of between about 5 and 70 by weight, preferably from about 25 to about 45 . Included in the tm powdered dry cheese are any powdered dry cheeses of various flavors, e.g., cheddar, cream cheese, rornano, blurt or dehydrated fat containing food powder such as peanut powder. The milk ingredient is a non fat dry milk in an amount of from about 5 to about 70 , preferably also from about 25 to about 45 . The term dry milk includes but is not limited to non fat dry milk, whole milk powder, buttermilk powder, dried creams, and nondairy substitutes such as caseinates, whey blends, soy protein, etc. The fat is included in an amount of from about 25 to about 50 by weight, but preferably from about 20 to about 35 by weight. Examples of fats which can be used herein include but are not limited to those of anir..al, vegetable, or mineral origins which are solid at room temperature and have softening points consistent with desired organoleptic qualities, e.g., 26 and 43 C 80 to 110 F. . If a dispersing agent is used, it should be included in an amount of from about 0,28 to about 1. by weight, and preferably from about 0.3 to about 0.6 by weight. Other flavor additives may also be included to enhance the product by giving an artifiial or natural flavor or combinations thereof. Such additives include, but are limited to, bacon bits, jalapino flavouring, meat flavors such as smoked flavoring, vegetable flavoring, e.g., onion, garlic, spices, etc. The resulting composition can then be deposited and allowed to set in the desired configuravion, e.g., as a sheet, in a mold form, and or as a coating which can be effected by methods such as enrobing, panning, etc. In order to achieve a particular flavor, additional materials such as, for example, bacon bits, etc. can be included in the composition. As a result of the present composition and process, a shelf stable cheese flavored cor.fection can be provided having a smooth texture that has a mouth feel and dissolution capability resembling chocolate and which requires no refrigeration. Such a composition is extremely valuable in the snack and confection industry in that . it supplies a desirably flavored confection which is a sucrose free substitute for chocolate, and other similarly textured products. For a better understanding of the present invention, together with other and further objects, reference is made to the following description, and its scope will be pointed out in the appended claims. A delicious highly flavored cheese confection composition having a smooth chocolate like texture can be prepared in accordance with the general formula found in TABLE I. TABLE I Percent RangeComponent by WeightPowdered Dry Cheese 5 708Dry Milk 5 70 7at which r.elts at from about 80 F. to about 110 CF. 15 508 Dispersing Agent 0 1.2 Additional Flavoring gent 0 10 The composition set forth above is prepared by first blending the powdered dry cheese an dry milk.The fat is melted either with or without a dispersing agent and then processed in combination with the previously prepared blend Such processing, which is readily achieved by use of mixer blender e.g. such as a Hobart type or refined by use of a three or five roll mill, forcibly coats the fat onto the cheese particles, and in the case of refning simultaneously breaks down the cheese particles. In the alternative refiner method a portion of the fat with a dispersing agent can be added after refining. It is important, however, to insure that the cheese powder and fat are processed together to form an essentially homoger.eous zat covered dry cheese dry milk melt. Optionally, additional flavcr components such as bacon bits can be included before depositing to produce the desired product. EXAMPLES Specific compositions were prepared pursuant to the present invention according to the formula shown inTABLE II. TABLE II Percent RangeComponent By weightPowdered Dry Cheese Spray dried, aged Cheddar Cheese flavoring having a maximum of about 5 Moisture Por Example Borden s Cheddar Cheese Flavoring Powder 25 45t Non fat Dry Milk 25 45 Fat Solvent Fractionated Lauric Butter such as those sold by D urkee 20 35 Dispersing Agent LecithinAdditional Flavoring Bacon Bits 7.08 9.0t The powdered dry cheese and the nonfat dry milk were blended to form a dry mix. After the fat component was melted separately to temperature of about 140 F., lecithin was added and blended to insure proper dispersion o the fat over the cheese.The fat melt in liquid form was then added to the cheese, as well as bacon bits, and processed. On a pilot scale the processIng was achieved by a blender mixer, but it is believed that a five roll mill refiner will work better on a large scale. The melt blend was processed for a time of from about 3 to about 5 minutes at a temperature of from about 370C 1000F to about 580C 1350F to insure proper coating of the cheese particles, after which the composition was deposited in mnld forms at a temperature of about 35 C 95 F to 370C 1000F . The resulting product was a firm attractive confectionary unit having a rich cheese flavoring which had a sooth chocolate like organoleptic quality. Upon preparing seyeral experimental samples it was found that the following composition formed the most desirable and easily useable composition for the blending mixing type processing. TABLE IIIComponent Percent by WeightPowdered Dry Cheese 26.0 Non Fat Dry Milk 26.0 Fat Component 39 08 Dispersing Agent 0.34 Bacon Dits 8.7 Total 100.0 Another cheese flavored composition was prepared in accordance with the formula in TABLE IV. TABLE IVComponent Percent by WeightPowdered Dry Cheese 34,88 Non fat Dry Milk 34.88 Fat Component 30.0 Dispersing Agent 0.4 100.0 The powdered dry cheese and non fat dry milk were blended for a time of from about three to five minutes to form a dry mix. To the resulting dry mlx a portion of the fat component, from about one half to three fourths and preferably about two thirds, was added in a melted liquid state, at a temperature of about 600C 140 F .The resulting admixture was processed by refining in a three roll refiner to effect proper coating of the cheese particles with the fat components This refined combination which is a flaked solid form, is introduced to a mixer blender and heated to a temperature sufficient to convert the refined admixture to a molten state. The remaining portion of the fat component which had been previously melted and combined with the dispersing agent was then added to the melted admixture and blended together. The composition formed by this latter process has been found to be particularly effective in a number of confectionary roles. For example, the cheese flavored composition can be easily remelted and used for coating processes such as enrobing nd panning. Thus, it may be conveniently applied to items such as nuts, wafers, crackers, dried fruits, dried meats, etc. The composition maintains its original consistency without degradation due to, e.g., separation of fat from solids. Thus, while there have been described what are presently believed to be the preferred embodiments of the Invention, those skilied in the art will realize that changes and modific tions may be made thereto without departing from the spirit of the Invention, and it is intended to claim all such char.ges and modifications as fall within the true scope of the invention.
