## Description
FLUID PRESSURE SENSING APPARATUS The present invention relates to fluid pressure sensing apparatus and, more particularly, to such apparatus for monitoring fluid pressure within the delivery tube of a medical infusion pump or for use in other applications where there is a requirement for monitoring fluid pressure within a fluid flow tube without permitting direct access to the fluid flow, itself. In a medical infusion pump, for example, which operates on a peristaltic principle and applies a peristaltic pumping action to the resilient walled delivery tube of a simple intraveneous infusion set, fluid delivery under pressure is achieved without violating the sterile barrier maintained internally within the infusion set. However, with such a system, there is a need for a pressure limiting facility in order to protect the patient and the infusion system from excessive pressure build up in the delivery tube downstream of the pump, in the event of an occlusion or other blockage occurring. Such a facility requires apparatus for sensing or monitoring pressure within the delivery tube without, again, violating the sterile barrier represented by the tube and it is an object of the present invention to provide such apparatus. The invention consists in apparatus for sensing fluid pressure within a fluid delivery tube, comprising resilient means for engaging the delivery tube, a strain gauge device coupled to the Wresilient means to detect deflection or distortion thereof in response to fluid pressure within the tube, and means for processing output signals produced by the strain gauge device and providing data corresponding to the fluid pressure within the delivery tube. The resilient means may comprise a resilient member, to which the strain gauge is affixed, disposed in spaced relation with a rigid surface, the spacing being such that the delivery tube is slightly flattened or distorted when engaged between the resilient member and rigid surface. Conveniently, the resilient means is a channel shaped device having opposed resilient and rigid side walls. However, in an alternative embodiment, it may be a channel shaped member made from resilient material and having the strain gauge affixed to the underside of its external surface. The apparatus may be calibrated so that the data produced by the processing means provides an indication of the pressure distorting the resilient member.The processing means may be adapted to produce an alarm signal when the processing means establishes that an output signal from the strain guage differs from a predetermined value or falls outside predetermined limits. The invention is particularly suitable for sensing pressure changes within a fluid delivery tube and producing an alarm signal when the detected pressure falls outside predetermined limits. Hence, the processing means may comprise storage means for storing reference data corresponding to an initial or datum output signal produced by the strain gauge and comparator means for comparing data corresponding to subsequent output signals from the strain gauge with the reference data and initiating an alarm signal whep the subsequent data differs from the reference data by more than a predetermined value. The alarm signal may be an audio and or visual alarm signal. The visual alarm may comprise a digital display for displaying information corresponding to output signals produced by the strain gauge. In the case where the apparatus is arranged to sense pressure changes, it may accommodate a range of different tube sizes because the only information required relates to pressure change rather than absolute pressure. Any variation in the initial distortion of the resilient means owing to different tube sizes is immaterial. In order that the present invention may be more readily understood, reference will now be made to the accompanying drawing which is a schematic diagram of one embodiment of the invention. Referring to the drawing, the apparatus includes a channel shaped device 1 which comprises a resilient side wall la, made from spring steel or other similar resilient material, and a rigid side wall lb connected to the resilient side wall, in opposed spaced relation therewith, by means of a rigid spacer bar lc which is disposed between mutually adjacent edges of the two side walls and to which the two walls are fixed by suitable fastening means, such as, screws ld. The side walls la,lb are arranged to embrace a portion of a flexible or resilient walled delivery tube 2 loaded into a peristaltic pump not shown , at a position downstream of the pump head.The spacing of the side walls 1a,1b is such that, when the delivery tube is fitted into the channel device, the portion embraced by the side walls fits snugly between the arms and is slightly flattened or distorted. Conversely, the resilient side wall la is slightly deflected. Hence, the tube 2 is gripped by the side walls of the channel device and is retained in this position during a pumping operation. In use, the channel device 1 is so mounted that the resilient side wall la is free to deflect under the action of the fluid pressure within the tube 2 without interference. For example, it may be associated with tube guides housed within the peristaltic pump. Bonded to the external surface of the resilient side wall la of the channel device, in a zone overlapping the marginal portion of the side wall la fastened to the spacer bar lc, is a strain gauge 7 which is connected to a strain gauge bridge circuit 4 of electronic control circuitry for the system, via a termainal block 5 fastened to the side wall la. The output of the strain gauge bridge 4 is connected to an amplifier 6 which is connected to one of the plurality of inputs of an analogue multiplexer 7 having its output connected to an analogue to digital A D converter 8. A microprocessor 9, conveniently, an 8 bit microprocessor, such as that marketed by RCA Inc. under the Model No.CDP 1806 Ace, is interconnected with the multiplexer 7 and the A D converter 8 via a control bus 10 and an 8 bit data bus 11. The latter also interconnect the microprocessor with alarm logic and digital display circuitry 12,13. The alarm logic circuit 12 is connected to control an audio alarm 14 and a visual alarm indication associated with the digital display 13. Upon loading of a primed delivery tube 2 into the channel device 1, a standing resistance is produced in the strain gauge 3 owing to the deflection of the side wall la by the tube which is, itself, slightly flattened. The resulting output signal from the strain gauge bridge 4 is amplified and sampled by the microprocessor 9 which switches the amplifier output through the multiplexer 7 to the A D converter 8. The digital signal produced by the converter 8 is supplied to the microprocessor via the data bus 11 and is stored in the memory of the microprocessor as a reference datum against which future sample readings taken during operation of the pump are compared. As the pressure within the tube 2 varies during pumping, the resilient side wall la of the channel device 1 is either flexed outwardly or restores inwardly and these changes are registered in the output signal from the strain gauge bridge circuit 4. An occlusion or partial occlusion of the delivery tube 2 causes outward deflection of the side wall la resulting in a change of strain gauge resistance and variation of the bridge circuit output signal.The microprocessor 9 samples the various inputs to the multiplexer 7 and, at the next sampling of the amplifier output, the change in digital output signal from the A D converter 8 is compared with the reference datum or information stored in the microprocessor memory and, if the variation between the two values exceeds preset limits also stored in the microprocessor memory, the microprocessor signals the alarm logic 12 which operates the audio alarm 14 and causes a visual alarm signal to be displayed on the digital display 13 to attract the attention of the pump operator. During normal pumping, the microprocessor 9 also supplied fluid pressure information to the digital display, via the data bus, in order to provide a visual display of fluid pressure information. The multiplexer 7 permits the use of a sequence sampling system and the microprocessor 9 can interrogate the output of the A D converter 8 for access to different information supplied to the various inputs of the multiplexer, thus keeping cost and component parts to a minimum through the multipurpose use of the same circuits. Whilst a particular embodiment has been described, it will be apparent that modifications can be made without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.
