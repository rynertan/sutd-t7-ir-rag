# BOTTLE CLOSURE

## Abstract
A closure for an externally screw threaded standard glass or plastics container has a mouided plastics shell and a liner gasket which can turn freely in it. The liner is retained in the shell by a central spigot which fits loosely in a hole in the centre of the liner gasket, but has an enlarged head. The gasket, which is smaller in diameter than the top of the shell, is pressed against the top end of the container, for which it is designed, by one or two ribs. This arrangement allows the liner gasketto remain stationary on the container at the commencement of releasing the closure.
