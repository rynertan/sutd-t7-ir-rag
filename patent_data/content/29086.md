# Improved process for the production of ethanol and catalyst thereof.

## Abstract
A process for producing ethanol from the reaction of methanol, hydrogen and carbon monoxide catalyzed by a phosphine iodine promoted cobaltruthenium catalyst, the improvement of maintaining the phosphine to halide ratio and concentration within a critical range, and whereby the concentration of phosphine compound in the reaction mixture is increased without causing an undesirable decrease in the activity of the catalyst thereby obtaining a highly stable and active catalyst providing an increased selectively to ethanol formation. This is accomplished under such conditions that the catalyst stability is maintained and the ratio of phosphine to nalide is kept at a relatively con stant value during the reaction.
