# Binary output processing in a digital computer.

## Abstract
Improved processing of binary output data bytes and associated desired output times is provided. The binary output data and desired output times are placed in a self sorting stack. Entries are time ordered based on their respective desired output times. A real time counter is used in comparing the stack entries, one by one, with real time. The entry with the earliest desired output time, except in the case of an output interrupt, is compared before any other desired output time associated with a byte of output data. CPU control of the stack is not required and digital computer throughput is increased. Interruption of the CPU programming is avoided relative to transmission of outputs.
