## Description
This invention relates to rotary die cutting of blanks from thin sheets or webs of material such as paper, paper board, cardboard, plastic film, metal foil, sheet metal, and the like. More particularly, this invention relates to stripping or removing cut portions or pieces from a web of material. Previously, a web of material was first cut by being passed between a pair of rotary cutting dies having blades which severed or cut portions of pieces of the web and then some of the cut portions or pieces were removed by passing the cut web between a separate pair of stripping cylinders or rolls at least one of which had a plane cylindrical surface. The cut pieces to be removed were transferred onto the cylindrical surface, and after the cylinder rotated sufficiently to carry the piece away from the web, it was removed from the cylinder by a stripper plate having a leading sharp edge bearing on the plane clyindrical surface. This approach has also been utilized directly on a pair of rotary cutting dies where one of the dies has a plane cylindrical surface see US A 3,893,359 which shows features a, b and d of claim 1 . To remove the cut pieces the sharp end of the stripper directly bears on the plane cylindrical surface of the mentioned die. This means that such rotary die cannot be provided with severing blades on its surface whereas in many cases both rotary dies are preferred to have severing blades thereon. The problem to be solved by the invention is to be free from that restriction, i. e. both rotary die cylinders can have cutting blades thereon. This problem is solved by the features of the characterising part of claim 1. Pursuant to this invention, a cut portion or piece of a web of material is transferred and releasably secured to a rotating cylinder which does not have a circumferentially continuous plane cylindrical surface, the transferred portion is generally pivoted with respect to the cylinder to move its leading edge generally radially outward from the periphery of the cylinder, and a stripping element such as a slider plate or comb passes between the rotating cylinder and the leading edge of the pivoted portion to remove the portion from the cylinder. Preferably the transferred portion is pivoted about a point or line intermediate its leading and trailing edges by moving a trailing part of the portion into a recess or pocket in the cylinder. Preferably, the trailing part is forced into the pocket by a projection on a second cylinder which corotates with the first cylinder with the web passing between the cylinders. Preferably, the cylinders also have severing blades thereon which cut at least the portions to be removed before they are removed. This invention has the advantage to provide a stripper mechanism for removing cut pieces of a web which can be embodied directly in a pair of rotary cutting dies having coacting severing blades on both dies, unfailingly, reliably, readily and easily removes cut pieces, can remove cut pieces which are scrap and or desired parts, is relatively simple, rugged, durable and of economical manufacture and assembly, and require little service or maintenance. The invention concerns also a method for removing pieces cut from a web of material according to claim 10. These and other objects, features and advantages of this invention will be apparent from the following detailed description, appended claims and accompanying drawings in which Referring in more detail to the drawings, Figure 1 illustrates a pair of rotary die cylinders 10 and 12 embodying this invention. When rotating the die cylinders cut elongate parts or blanks 14 and scrap portions 16 and 18 Fig. 2 from a web of material 20 passing between the cylinders. As the web 20 is fed into the dies, it is supported on a slide plate 22 and as the cut parts 14 emerge from the dies, they are supported by a slide plate 24 and fed into a conveyor assembly 26. In the conveyor 26, the cut parts 14 are received between and carried away by a pair of driven continuous belts or webs 28 each received on an idler pulley 30. The parts 14 are cut from the web 20 by serving blades disposed on one or both of the die cylinders 10 and 12. Preferably, the blades are constructed and arranged on the cylinders so that multiple parts are cut with each complete revolution of the cylinders. For example, as shown in Figures 3 and 4, the blades are arranged on the cylinders 10 and 12 so that they cut three parts 14 across the width of the cylinders and four parts in each path or tack around the circumference of the cylinders for a total of twelve parts for each complete revolution of the cylinders. Preferably, the die cylinders 10 and 12 have pairs of coacting elongate severing blades each disposed on one of the die cylinders with their axes on generally opposite sides of the cutting line or line of severance of the web. Thus, as shown in Figures 3 and 4, for cutting a part 14, the upper die cylinder 10 has severing blades 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44 and 46 which respectively coact with corresponding severing blades of the lower die 32 , 34 , 36 , 40 , 42 , 44 and 46 . As shown in Figures 5 7, the blades of each pair are disposed on opposite sides of the line of severance and preferably each blade is a land disposed on the periphery of its associated cylinder and having in cross section an outer face and spaced apart generally depending side faces defining a pair of spaced apart edges. Preferably, the side faces are inclined toward each other at an acute included angle and each inclined to its associated outer face at an obtuse included angle. The blades of each pair are constructed, arranged and positioned on their respective die cylinders such that during corotation of the die cylinders 10 and 12 the immediately adjacent edges of the blades of each pair cut the web therebetween along a predetermined line of severance while the other edges of the blades of each pair are on generally opposite sides of the line of severance. Preferably, each side face is inclined to its outer face at an obtuse included angle which is usually in the range of about 100 to 120 and preferably about 105 to 110 . Usually the transverse width of the outer face of each land is in the range of about 0,25 to 3,16 mm, typically about 0,5 to 1,5 mm, and preferably about 0,76 to 1,02 mm. Usually the radial height of the lands is about 1,27 to 1,5 mm, and preferably about 1,52 to 2,03 mm. The specific construction, arrangement, and position of the severing blades on the die cylinders is fully disclosed in United States patent application serial no. 06 589,505 filed on March 14, 1984 and assigned to the assignee of this application, Bernal Rotary Systems, Inc. The disclosure of this United States patent application serial no. 06 589,505 is incorporated herein by reference and hence, the construction and arrangement of the severing blades will not be described in greater detail herein. In accordance with this invention, scrap pieces 16 and 18 are removed after being cut from the web by a stripper mechanism 50. The scrap pieces 16 and 18 are removed in the same manner and hence, only the removal of a scrap piece 16 will be described in detail. As shown in Figures 1 and 5 8, each piece 16 is releasably secured to the lower die 12 for rotation therewith by at least one pin 52, pivoted so that its leading edge 54 is raised above the lower die 12 by cooperation of a finger 56 on the upper die 10 Fig. 7 , and then removed from the lower die by the cooperation of a comb or stripping plate 58 Fig. 8 . Preferably, although not necessarily, each piece 16 is secured to the lower die 12 before it is completely cut from the web 20. Each piece is secured by at least one pin 52 piercing the piece. As the dies rotate, each piece 16 is forced over the pins 52 by the cooperation and coaction of the lower die with the upper die 10 which has clearance holes 60 therein for the pins. Typically, pins 52 are about 1,27 to 2,03 mm in diameter and holes 60 are about 4,57 to 6,34 mm in diameter. To support and stabilize piece 16 on the lower die 12, the leading portion of the piece is preferably received on a prominence 62 on the lower die, the trailing portion of which provides a line or edge 64 about which the piece 16 is pivoted. Preferably, the pins 52 are threaded into the die 12 immediately adjacent this trailing edge 64. To facilitate forming the severing blades 42 and to provide adequate clearance between the dies for the piece 16, preferably a recess 66 is provided between the prominence and the severing blade. Preferably, although not necessarily, to further insure adequate clearance for the piece 16, the outer face of the prominence 62 lies radially inward of the outer faces of the adjacent severing blades a distance approximately equal to the thickness of the web 20 being cut. To permit the piece 16 to be pivoted, a recess or pocket 68 is formed in the lower die behind the trailing edge of the prominence to receive a trailing portion of the piece when it is displaced into the pocket by the finger 56. Preferably, but not necessarily, this pocket 68 has a radial depth about equal to the height of the severing blades of the lower cylinder 12. Typically, the prominence 62, pocket 68, and finger 56 are constructed, arranged and dimensioned so that they move the leading edge 54 of the piece away from the cylinder sufficiently to provide a clearance between them which is usually in the range of 0,127 to 2,539 mm, typically about 0,25 to 1,27 mm, and preferably about 0,5 to 1,0 mm. To facilitate making the cylinder 10, preferably the fingers are separate pieces secured to the cylinder. Each finger 56 can be a separate piece of rigid material such as steel secured to the cylinder 10 by bolts or the like. Preferably each finger is a separate piece of an elastic or resilient material such as rubber, plastic, elastic, or the like secured to the cylinder by an adhesive or double back adhesive tape. Suitable adhesive tape is available from 3M Company of Minneapolis, Minnesota and Morgan Adhesive Company of Stow, Ohio. To remove the pieces 16 from the lower die cylinder, the stripper plate 58 is mounted as shown in Figures 1 and 8 angularly downstream from the position at which the pieces are cut from the web. The stripper plate 58 is mounted so that its tip or leading edge 70 passes between the leading edge 54 of the pivoted piece 16 and the lower die cylinder as the piece 16 is advanced toward the stripper plate. As the piece 16 continues to be advanced, it engages the outer face 72 of the stripper plate and then the pins 52 are withdrawn from and disengage the piece as the lower cylinder continues to rotate. Preferably, the stripper plate 58 is positioned so that its outer face 72 is generally tangent to the periphery of the lower die. Preferably, the stripper plate has elongate clearance slots 74 in its leading edge through which the tips of the pins 54 pass as they are advanced by the cylinder. Preferably, the stripper plate is mounted in fixed relation to the lower cylinder with a slight clearance between the stripper plate and the cylinder. Figures 9 and 10 illustrate a modification in the way pieces 16 are secured to the lower die 12 so that the pieces can be secured without being pierced or damaged by any pins 52, clamps, or the like. In this modification, vacuum ports 76 open into the upper face of the prominence 62 adjacent its trailing edge 64 and are connected to a source of vacuum 78. These vacuum ports are used in lieu of the pins 52 to releasably secure parts 16 to the lower die cylinder. In all other respects, this modification is identical to the cutting and stripping dies of Figures 1 8. Because vacuum ports eliminate piercing or any physical damage to the pieces 16, they are a particularly desirable way of releasably securing pieces which are not scrap but cut parts or blanks to be used in making articles. When using this invention, dies 10 and 12 are mounted for corotation with a web 20 passing between them as shown in Figure 1. As the dies rotate in unison with the severing blades moving at the same surface speed and in the same direction when they engage the web 20, the blades cut parts 14 and scrap pieces 16 and 18 from the web. As the dies continue to rotate, parts 14 emerge from the dies, pass over the slide 24 and enter the conveyor 26 which carries them away. Since each piece of scrap 16 and 18 is removed in the same manner, removal of only one piece of scrap 16 will be described in detail. As will be apparent from a comparison of Figures 5 and 6, as each piece of scrap 16 and 18 is being cut from the web, it is releasably secured to the lower die 12 for rotation therewith by being pierced by one or more pins 52. Each pin 52 is forced through a piece of scrap by rotation of the dies which causes the pin 52 and a generally opposed portion of the upper die 10 to move generally radially toward each other with the piece of scrap between them. As the dies continue to rotate, the leading edge 54 of the piece of scrap is lifted and moved away from the lower die by pivoting the piece of scrap Fig. 7 about the trailing edge 64 of the prominence 62 underlying the piece of scrap. The piece of scrap is pivoted by rotation of the dies which causes the finger 56 of the upper die and the underlying pocket 68 of the lower die to move toward each other with a trailing portion of the piece of scrap between them which is engaged by the finger. As shown by a comparison of Figures 7 and 8, as the dies continue to rotate, the piece of scrap 16 is completely cut or severed from the web 20 and carried by the lower die away from the web and the path of travel of the cut parts 14. As shown in Figure 8, after the scrap is carried away, it is removed from the lower die by the cooperation of the stripper comb or plate 58 and the lower die. As the lower die advances, the sharp edge 70 of the stripper plate passes between the lower die and the raised leading edge 54 of the scrap piece. As the pin 54 passes through the slot 74 in the stripper plate, it is withdrawn from and thereby releases the scrap piece which passes over the upper face 72 of the plate and is thereby removed from the lower die. While the stripping mechanism 50 has been described as being embodied in a pair of cutting die cylinders, it will be apparent that it can also be embodied in a separate pair of cylinders disposed downstream from a pair of cutting cylinders or other cutting dies and receiving the web after it has been cut. To facilitate separating parts cut from a web, this stripping mechanism can also be used to cause each row of parts to be directed into separate conveyor systems or to separate every other part in a row of cut parts or to remove parts produced by a single cavity of the cutting dies, and the like. Hence, this stripping mechanism may be used in many applications where it is desirable to remove one or more pieces from a web of cut material.
