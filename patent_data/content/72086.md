# METHOD OF MANUFACTURE OF BAGS FROM SYNTHETIC PLASTICS MATERIAL AND APPARATUS THEREFOR

## Abstract
Apparatus for making side sealed bags 22.1, 22.2, 22.3 from a double layer web 22 of thin synthetic plastics film. The apparatus includes a rotatably moun ted sealing drum 14 having a plurality of circumfer entially spaced axially extending slots 16 in its peri phery. In use, the web 22 moves belt fashion over the slots 16 in contact with the drum 14 . A sealing rotor 18 running in synchronism with the drum 14 has a heat cutter member 20, 21 which intersects the web 22 at circumferentially spaced intervals by passing cyclically into the slots 16 of the drum 14 . The heat cutter member 20, 21 has spaced interruptions 21.2 along its length which result in spaced perforations 160.1 being made across the width of the web 22 . The two layers 22.11, 22.12 of film are welded together at such perforations 160.1 , thus forming side sealed bags separated by zones of weakness 160 . The web 22 is rolled up into a roll 26 of such side sealed bags 22.1, 22.2, 22.3 . The sealing rate and web speed can be adjusted to match the rate of extrusion of an ex truder 242 .
