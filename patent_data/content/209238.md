# DOUBLE PISTON ACOUSTIC TRANSDUCER WITH SELECTABLE DIRECTIVITY

## Abstract
A direction selective transducer which includes a center mass fixed between two active transducer element stacks and two head masses. The center mass couples the two stacks and allows the ratio of radiation produced by each head mass to be selected as desired by varying the amplitude and phase of drive voltages applied to the stacks. The transducer can also be used as a directional receiver.
