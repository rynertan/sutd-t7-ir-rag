## Description
The present invention relates to a magnetic bubble memory device hereinafter referred to as bubble memory . A bubble memory functions as a solid file memory having no moving parts. Recently, as the scope of use of bubble memory has increased, its high reliability in operation and resistance against vibration and shock has attracted attention to the possible use of this device as a memory device in aircraft. In a memory device used for this purpose, when an aircraft is flying at stratospheric heights, the memory device is subjected to temperatures as low as 55 JP A 54 59039 discloses a magnetic bubble device having means for controlling the intra face driving magnetic field in accordance with temperature. A control means senses the temperature of the magnetic bubble crystal and acts on the intra face driving field generator to increase the intra face driving field as the temperature decreases. According to the present invention, there is provided a magnetic bubble memory device, comprising An embodiment of the present invention can provide a superior magnetic bubble memory device which can ensure stable operation over a temperature range wider than the conventional range, without taking particular measures to keep the device warm. It must be taken into consideration that the narrow temperature range required for ensuring stable operation in a conventional device stems from the difference in thermodependency between the operation characteristic of a magnetic bubble memory chip and the bias field generated by permanent magnets. That is, as described hereinafter, the cause resides in the fact that the thermodependency of the upper limit and the lower limit of the operational region of the memory chip is nonlinear, while that of the bias field generated by the permanent magnets is linear, and as long as the thermodependency of the bias field is linear, it is difficult to ensure stable operation over a temperature range wider than that of a conventional device. In embodiments of the present invention, a bubble memory is provided with a bias field compensator for compensating the bias field so that its thermodependency approximates that of the operation characteristics of the memory chip over a wide temperature range, thereby ensuring a wide region of stable operation. In an embodiment of the present invention, the compensation field becomes strong as the temperature falls and, at a predetermined temperature, for example, 20 C or below, exceeds the shield limit of the magnetic shield, whereby the bias field is compensated. Another embodiment comprises means for adjusting the compensation field, which means may be constituted of, for example, permanent magnets, or screws of magnetic material. In a further embodiment, a spacer of a nonmagnetic material, in particular, a thermal conductive material such as aluminum, copper, or ceramics, is disposed between the compensation field generating means and the magnetic shield, whereby a reduction in undesirable interference between the bias field and the compensating field and an improvement in heat radiation can be obtained. Moreover, the provision of heat radiating elements for the compensation field generating means results in a further improvement in heat radiation. In a still further embodiment, the magnetic bubble memory chip, the bias field generating means, and the magnetic shield are assembled together into a memory package, and one or more memory package s are mounted, preferably together with other electrical circuit elements which are not influenced by the magnetic field, on a mounting board, such as a printed circuit board, so as to construct a unit. In this case, one set of the compensation field generating means may be provided for each memory package, or one set for the entire unit, in such a manner that it can be used in common by all of the memory packages. Reference is made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings in which First, the prior art will be described with reference to Figs. 1 through 6. Figures 1 and 2 are a partially broken, disassembled, perspective view and a diagramatic side view, respectively, illustrating a structure of a conventional bubble memory package. In these Figures, the reference characters PA designate the package in general, which comprises a magnetic bubble memory chip 1 hereinafter referred to as memory chip , a printed circuit board 2 for mounting the memory chip 1 thereon, permanent magnets 3 and 4 generating a bias field H The memory chip 1 basically comprises a substrate of a single crystal, such as gadolinium gallium garnet, on which a magnetic thin film i.e., bubble crystal of magnetic garnet is formed by a liquid phase epitaxial growth technique. Information is stored in the memory chip, in such a manner that 1 and 0 zero of a binary coded information correspond to existence and non existence of the bubble in the bubble crystal, respectively. The bubble is a bubble shaped magnetic domain existing in the bubble crystal and can exist only under the application of a bias field having a suitable strength. The bubble collapses when the bias field is stronger than a certain strength, and strips out into a stripe domain when the bias field is weaker than a certain strength. The bias fields having such strengths are called a collapse field and a strip out or stripe out field , respectively. Moreover, the memory chip 1 is provided, on the bubble crystal, with various functional sections performing functions such as generation, transfer, replication, and detection of the bubble, and with bubble propagation tracks defined by patterns of magnetically soft material, such as permalloy, or ion implanted patterns. The application of the in plane rotating drive field H The operation characteristics of such bubble memory chips are usually judged by an operational margin of the bias field H The operation of the bubble memory chip depends on the temperature. Figure 4 shows the thermodependency of the free bubble collapse field H₀. As illustrated, H₀ varies nonlinearly with respect to the variation of the temperature T, but the average rate of variation over the range from 0 C to 70 C is 0.2 C. Figure 5 shows the thermodependency of the operation characteristics of the memory chip under the drive field of H Next, embodiments of the present invention will be described. Figure 7 is a side view of an embodiment of a magnetic bubble memory package according to the present invention. In the Figure, the reference character PA designates a package in general which is the same as the conventional package shown in Fig. 2. A compensation field generator 10 is disposed externally of the package PA. The compensating field generator 10 comprises plates 11 and 12 made of magnetically soft material, such as permalloy, and disposed on upper and lower sides of the magnetic shield 6 of the package PA, and permanent magnets 13 and 14 disposed between the plates 11 and 12 at the opposite end portions of these plates 11 and 12. The permanent magnets 13 and 14 are arranged so that their north N poles and south S poles are oriented upwards and downwards in the Figure, respectively, whereby a compensation field H On the other hand, Fig. 8 shows the shield characteristic of the shield case 6. As can be understood from the Figure, the internal field of the shield case abruptly varies when the external field exceeds 70 Oe. This means that the shield case is saturated by the external field of 70 Oe and thus permits the field component exceeding 70 Oe to pass therethrough. Accordingly, where the compensation field H As a result, as shown in Fig. 9 and similar to Fig. 5, the bias field H It should be noted that the shield case 6 loses the shield function when saturated with the compensating field H Figures 11 through 14 show second through fifth embodiments of the bubble memory package according to the present invention. The basic structure and operation in these embodiments are the same as in the first embodiment described above, and accordingly, the same or similar parts are designated by the same references. In the second embodiment illustrated in Fig. 11, small permanent magnets 15 and 16 are rotatably disposed at the opposite end portions of the magnetically soft plates 11 and 12. The rotation of these magnets causes the angle of their magnetic axes with respect to the direction of the compensation field to vary, thereby adjusting the strength of the compensation field H In the third embodiment illustrated in Fig. 12, the magnetically soft plate 11 is provided with screws 17 and 18 of magnetic material at the opposite end portions. By screwing in or out these screws, the strength of the compensation field H In the fourth embodiment illustrated in Fig. 13, spacers 19 and 20 hatched for elucidation of non magnetic material are disposed between the shield case 6 and the magnetically soft plates 11 and 12. This structure provides the reduction in undesirable interference between the bias field and the compensation field. The spacers 19 and 20 are preferably of heat conductive material, such as Al, Cu, or ceramics, for providing good heat radiation. In the fifth embodiment illustrated in Fig. 14, the magnetically soft plate 11 is provided with heat radiating fins 21 on the surface thereof. Accordingly, the plate 11 also serves as a heat radiator, whereby the thermal characteristic in the high temperature range is also improved. The magnetically soft plate 11 may be provided with undulations on its surface, instead of the fins 21. In this case, the surface of the plate 11 itself may be undulated, or another plate with the undulation preformed may be attached to the plate 11. Further, the spacers 19 and 20 and the heat radiating fins 21 described above may be used in combination, and the spacers 19 and 20 and or the heat radiating fins 21 may be provided in the embodiments illustrated in Figs. 7, 11, and 12. Usually, one or more of the magnetic bubble memory packages mentioned above are mounted on a mounting board, so as to construct a unit. Figure 15 shows a first embodiment of such a magnetic bubble memory unit, in which three packages PA are mounted on a printed circuit board PB, and each of the packages PA is provided with the above described compensation field generator 10, so that the bias fields in the packages are individually compensated. In this unit, the compensation field generator 10 may be any one of those illustrated in Figs. 7 and 11 through 14 or may be constructed by a combination of those units. Further, it is taken as a matter of course that, in this unit, electric circuit elements other than the memory package, such as integrated circuits IC , resistances, or capacitors, which are not influenced by the magnetic field, can be mounted together on the printed circuit board PB. Figures 16 and 17 show a second embodiment of the magnetic bubble memory unit, in which the compensation field generator is not provided to each of the packages, but a compensation field generator 100 which is common to all of the packages PA is disposed externally of the unit to accommodate the latter therein. The compensation field generator 100 has the same structure, except for the size, as that of the above described compensation field generator 10, and its component parts are designated by the same references. The structure of this embodiment has an advantage in that modification in particulars of the assembled unit or reconstruction of the unit in use is easy, because it is necessary only to add the compensation field generator to the unit externally of the latter. Further, this second embodiment of the unit also may be further provided with the compensation field adjusting means, i.e., the permanent magnets 15 and 16 or the screws 17 and 18, the spacers 19, and the heat radiating fins 21, similar to the embodiments illustrated in Figs. 11 through 14. Figures 18 through 21 show such embodiments. A third embodiment illustrated in Fig. 18 comprises permanent magnets 15 and 16, as in the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 11, and a fourth embodiment illustrated in Fig. 19 comprises screws 17 and 18, as in the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 12. A fifth embodiment illustrated in Fig. 20 comprises spacers 19, as in the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 13, but the spacers 19 are disposed only between the upper magnetically soft plate 11 and the magnetic shields 6 of the packages. A sixth embodiment illustrated in Fig. 21 corresponds to the fifth embodiment illustrated in Fig. 20, but further comprises heat radiation fins 21, as in the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 14. Furthermore, it is also taken as a matter of course that, in the embodiments illustrated in Figs. 16 through 21, electric circuit elements which are not influenced by the magnetic field can be mounted together with the packages PA on the printed circuit board PB. As described above, the present invention can provide a magnetic bubble memory device in which operation is ensured over a very wide temperature range, together with a high reliability against vibration and shock, and accordingly, can be applied for use for many various purposes.
