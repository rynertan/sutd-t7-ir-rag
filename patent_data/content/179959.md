## Description
CONJUGATES OF LEUKOTRIENES WITH PROTEINS The concept of using conjugates of leukotrienes in a radioimmunoassay was described, byL. Levine, R. A. Morgan, R. A. Lewis, K. F. Austin,D. A. Clark, A. Marfat, and E. J. Corey, Proceeding of the National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A., Vol. 78,No. 12 7692 1981 . This method uses direct coupling through an activated acid derivative to the protein.This method is much less effective than the present invention. Bifunctional cross linking reagents useful in preparation of proto hapten conjugates have also been prepared, see Kitagawa, J. Biochem. 79, 233 236 and Kitagawa, Chem. Pharm. Bull. 29 4 , 1130 1135 describing maleimido succinimide derivatives. The present invention relates to conjugates of leukotrienes C4, r B4, D4 or E4 preferably C4 and B4 with a protein selected from hemocyanine from giant keyhole limpets KLH , bovine serum albumin BSA , human serum albumin, tetanus antigen, diphtheriae toxoid, or CRM 197 a diphtheriae toxoid produced by a mutant of Corynebacterium diphtheriae , through the coupling agents 1,5 difluoro 2,4 dinitrobenzene or 6 N maleimidoalkanoic acid chloride, preferably 6 N maleimidohexanoic acid chloride, wherein the alkanoic moiety has 2 to 8 carbon atoms.The conjugates are useful in a sensitive and specific immunoassay and are also useful immunotherapeutic agents in the treatment of various allergic and chronic inflammatory diseases of the skin, lung and airways, including asthma, allergic rhinitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and skin diseases such as psoriasis and eczema. The present invention also relates to useful reagents for preparing such conjugates. Leukotriene C4 LTC4 has the following structure EMI2.1 Leukotriene B4 LTB4 has the following structure EMI3.1 Leukotriene D4 LTD4 has the following structure EMI3.2 Leukotriene E4 LTE4 has the following structure EMI3.3 The present invention also relates to the following compounds which are useful in preparing the conjugates especially the conjugates of LTB4 EMI4.1 wherein n is 0 to 10, preferably 0 or 2 to 10, more preferably 0 or 3.EMI4.2 wherein n is 0 to 10, preferably 0 or 2 to 10, more preferably 0 or 3.EMI4.3 wherein n is 0 to 10, preferably 0 or 2 to 10, more preferably 0 or 3. In the above three compounds, the compounds where n is 1 are likely to be less stable than the other compounds having the same generic formula. The preparation of the conjugates of the present invention may be illustrated by reference to conjugates of LTC4 and LTB4. For LTC4, coupling procedures were selected so that the reactions took place on the free amino group of the glutamyl residue, thus retaining the most important parts of the LTC4 molecule unchanged. The general conjugation procedure utilized a stepwise method with well characterized intermediates. The strong W absorption of the triene chromophore in LTC4 E 40,000 at 280 nm was used as a probe for determining coupling efficiencies and for monitoring the state of theLTC4 molecules throughout the procedures. Coupling ratios in the ranges of 5 to 15 equivalents of LTC4 per 100,000 daltons of protein were desired.Conjugates of LTC4 Conjugations using 1,5 difluoro 2,4 dinitrobenzene as coupling agent The reagent, 1,5 difluoro 2,4 dinitrobenzene DFDQB reacts quite specifically with amino functions, allowing clean stepwise replacement of the two fluorine atoms the second fluorine being replaced at a much slower rate . In addition, the strong and characteristic W absorptions of the reagent, and its mono and diamino substituted derivatives allows one to follow the course of the coupling procedure and to quantitate the final adducts by UV spectroscopy. LTC4 was found to react essentially quantitatively with excess DFDNB in pH 7.2 buffered aqueous methanol within 30 minutes. The intermediates thus formed could be characterized byHPLC analysis, by the appearance of a strong W band at 345 nm characteristic of l amino 5 fluoro 2,4dinitrobenzenes. After removal of methanol from the reaction the excess DFDNB could be removed by ether extraction. The intermediates could be further purified by HPLC but this was found to not offer any advantage and, in general, the crude reaction mixture was then allowed to react with protein in pH 8.5 buffer for two days in the dark. Final separation of the conjugates from unreacted LTC4 or reagents was achieved by filtration on Sephadex G 50.The derived coupled products now showed W absorptions at 342 and 420 nm characteristic of 1,5 diaminodinitrobenzenes as well as the characteristic absorptions of the triene system at 271, 282, and 291 nm in the case of the LTC4 conjugates. In this manner, S p chlorophenacylglutathione when reacted in 10 1 molar ratio with BSA gave a conjugate with about 6 moles of hapten per mole of BSA. Similarly, LTC4 in 30 fold molar excess gave a conjugate with BSA with 9 10 moles LTC4 per mole BSA, and LTC4 in ca. 30 fold molar excess calculated per 100,000 daltons protein , gave a conjugate with KLH with 11 12 equivalents LTC4 per 100,000 daltons KLH. Conjugation using 6 N maleimidohexanoic acid chloride as coupling agent Since this invention provides a secondLTC4 protein conjugate using a different spacer group, a number of potential coupling methods were examined. A direct coupling using a reagent such asDCC or ECDI 6 was considered but quickly rejected due to the expectation that a heterogeneous mixture of adducts would be formed. Also, preliminary experiments indicated that the efficiency of such a coupling would be low. The known agents, toluene diisocyanate and m maleimidobenzoyl N hydroxysuccinimide ester were not used due to the possibility of immunological cross reactivity with respect to the spacer units between the two conjugates. The coupling agent 6 N maleimidohexanoic acid chloride provides rapid, selective functionalization of the glutamyl amino group ofLTC4, as well as high coupling efficiency. The agent chosen was 6 N maleimidohexanoic acid chloride which was readily prepared from 6 aminohexanoic acid. Other analogous reagents having from 2 8 carbon atoms in the chain can be used, e.g., 2 aminoacetic acid up to 8 amino octanoic acid. The 6 N maleimidohexanoic acid amide ofLTC4 was prepared by reacting a methanolic solution of LTC4 tripotassium salt with the reagent 1.5 equivalents in dry THF in the presence of excessEt3N. HPLC analysis showed essentially complete conversion to the amide eluting before LTC4 onRP HPLC . A portion of this adduct, isolated fromHPLC, had W characteristics essentially unchanged from those of LTC4. For subsequent coupling with thiolated protein KLH the crude mixture in pH 7.2 borate buffer was used as such. The thiolated protein used, in this case derived from KLH, was prepared by reaction withS acetylmercaptosuccinic anhydride. As no report of thiolation of KLH could be found in the literature, trials were done to determine conditions for obtaining KLH with about 20 S acetyl groups per 100,000 daltons protein thio content, after hydrolysis of the acetyl groups, was determined byElleman s method. The S acetylmercaptosuccinyl derivatized KLH was highly unstable to oxygen until further reacted with N ethyl maleimide NEM . However, once any free SH groups were thus reacted, the material could be handled and purified bySephadex G 50 filtration. Concentration of the resulting purified protein was accomplished by dialysis against a packing of anhydrous Sephadex G 200 resin. Just prior to coupling with derivatized LTC4, the thiol groups were liberated by hydrolysis of the rigorously deoxygenated solution at pH 11.5 followed by reduction of the pH to 7.2. This mixture was then reacted with the deoxygenated solution of the 6 N maleimidohexanoic acid amide of LTC4 in a ratio of 80 equivalentsLTC4 per 100,000 daltons KLH. After stabilization with NEM and purification by Sephedex G 50, the protein conjugate showed 7 10 moles LTC4 per 100,000 daltons KLH by UV analysis. The protein solution has proven to be very stable during several months storage frozen at 780C. More detailed examples follow. It is noted that IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer 267Grating Spectrophotometer. PMR spectra were recorded on a Varian EM 390 spectrometer. UV spectra were recorded on a Cary 210 spectrophotometer. Spectra were recorded in water unless otherwise indicated.Sephadex G 50 medium grade was obtained fromPharmacia Fine Chemicals. Bovine Serum Albumin was obtained as crystallized and lyophilized grade from SigmaChemical Co. and Hemocyanin Keyhole Limpet was obtained as lyophilized powder from CalbiochemBehring Corp. Leukotriene C4 was synthetic material prepared in our laboratories using known procedures,Rokach et al., Tet. Lett., 21, 1485 1980 . Preparation of LTB4 conjugates is illustrated by the following reaction schemes Scheme 1EMI10.1 EMI11.1 This method makes use of the immediate synthetic precursor to LTB4, Ethyl 5 S benzoyloxy 12 R hydroxy 6,14 Z 8,10 E eicosatetraenoate II . We reasoned that reaction of II with a volatile diamine such as 1,3 diaminopropane would at the same time remove the benzoate protecting group and convert the ethyl ester to the w aminopropylamide, all under mild weakly basic conditions. The solvents could then be removed under vacuum leaving only a mixture of the product III and N w aminopropylbenzamide. In model studies, using ethyl 5 4 octylphenyl 5 benzoyloxypentanoate this reaction was found to be extremely sluggish, even in neat 1,3 diaminopropane.However, when a catalytic amount of 2 hydroxypyridine was added to the reaction mixture, the diester was smoothly converted to the desired aminoamide. When applied to the protectedLTB4 II a similar smooth conversion to III was effected. III could be reacted directly in the next step, after removal of the volatile components. The aminoamide III was reacted with excess 1,5 difluoro2,4 dinitrobenzene in the presence of triethylamine to provide the adduct IV in high yield. This product was purified by reverse phase HPLC and was fully characterized by UV and PMR spectroscopy. Finally, IV reacted smoothly with bovine serum albumin BSA mole ratio 12 l in a mixture of dimethylformamide and pH 8.5 borate buffer to provide the conjugate V which was purified by chromatography on SephadexG 50.W spectral analysis indicated that the triene chromophore was unchanged and allowed the estimation that 5.5 8.3 moles of LTB4 were coupled per mole ofBSA. 45 70 coupling efficiency . The aminoamide III could also be prepared by direct reaction of LTB4 lactone with 1,3 diaminopropane at room temperature. This provided III in quantitative yield free of side products. Scheme 2EMI13.1 Another type of LTB4 conjugate could be prepared as illustrated in Scheme 2. Lactone VI reacted cleanly with hydrazine to provide the hydrazide VII in quantitative yield. VII was reacted further with 6 N maleimidohexanoic acid chloride to give the diacyl hydrazide VIII . This material could be purified by reverse phase HPLC to remove the excess reagent byproducts. However, attempts to concentrate the product in order to obtain a PMR spectrum led to partial decomposition apparently due to hydration or methanolysis of the maleimide system. It was found however, that the crude reaction product could be used in the subsequent coupling reaction. VIII was reacted with thiolated KLH in a ratio of 50 moles of VIII per 100,000 daltons KLH, to provide the desired conjugate IX which was purified ty filtration through Sephadex G 50. W analysis indicated that 12 equivalents of LTB4 were bound per 100,000 daltons of KLH. EXAMPLE 1 Conjugates of LTC4 Using 1,5 Difluoro 2,4 dinitrobenzene as Coupling Agent A. Conjugation of S p Chlorophenacylgluta thione and Bovine Serum Albumin BSA 1,5 Difluoro 2,4 dinitrobenzene 120 mg, 0.59 mmol in methanol 6 ml was added to a solution of S 2 chlorophenacylglutathione 88 mg, 0.19 mmol in 9 mL of phosphate buffer putt 7.2, 0.1N . After stirring 12 hours at room temp ature the methanol was removed in vacuo and the resulting aqueous solution was washed with ether. The aqueous layer was chromatographed on C 18 Silica Gel eluting with methanol water 1 1 to provide the pure adduct intermediate 105 mg .

The adduct 1.05 mg, 1.63 X 10 6 mol in water 0.1 mL was added to a solution of BSA 10 mg, 1.49 X 10 7 mol in borate buffer pH 8.5, 0.2 N, 1 mL . After standing in the dark at room temperature for 71 hours the solution was centrifuged and filtered on Sephadex G 50 1.5 X 75 cm eluting with water. Fractions 10.5 mL eluting after the void volume 55 mL contained protein and were analyzed byUV. A sample of this solution diluted 5 times had aW spectrum in H2O Amax Absorbance 342 0.369 , 425 nm 0.133 . Assuming 8 mg of protein were recovered and assuming for the 1,5 diamino 2,4dinitrobenzene chromophor of ca. 27,000 3 at 342 nm the W indicated 6 moles of S E chlorophenacyl lutathione were conjugated per mole of BSA.B. Conjugation of Leukotriene C4 and Bovine Serum Albumin Leukotriene C4 tripotassium salt 2.5 mg was dissolved in 1 mL of phosphate buffer pH 7.2, 0.1N . 1,5 Difluoro 2,4 dinitrobenzene 1 mg in methanol 0.6 mL was added and the mixture was left 30 min. t room temperature. The methanol was removed under a stream of N2 and then in vacuo to remove final traces followed by extraction with ether 3 x 2 mL to remove unreacted reagent. The last traces of ether were removed under N2 and in vacuo. To this mixture was added bovine serum albumin BSA 10 mg in borate buffer 0.2M, pH 8.5, 1 mL , and the mixture was left to stand at room temperature in the dark for two days.The reaction mixture was filtered on a column of Sephadex G 50 1.5 x 75 cm eluting with water and the yellow protein eluting in 18 mL, after the void volume, of ca. 55 mL, was collected. At about the 140 mL dead volume a peak considered to contain unreacted LTC4 eluted. Direct W analysis on the protein fractions combined gave a spectrum Amax A 271 sh , 282 3.57 , 291, 342 1.835 and 420 nm 0.91 . Assuming about 9 mg of protein were recovered, and assuming for the 1,5 diamino 2,4 dinitrobenzene of about 27,000 at 340 nm and for LTC4 at 280 nm of 40,000, calculations based on the 282 nm absorption about 10.0 mole of LTC4 per mole BSA while calculations based on the absorption of 342 nm indicated 9.1 moles LTC4 per mole BSA. C. Conjugation of Leukotriene C4 and Hemocyanin from Giant Keyhole Limpets KLH Leukotriene C4 tripotassium salt 2.1 mg , and 1,5 difluoro 2,4 dinitrobenzene 8 mg were reacted as in reaction A. To the resultant adduct was added KLH 15 mg in borate buffer pH 8.5, 0.2M, 0.83 mL and the mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature 60 hours. At this time a precipitate of denatured KLH had formed which was removed by centrifugation 6 mg, dry weight . The supernatant was filtered on Sephadex G 50 as before yielding a yellow protein fraction eluting in 17 mL following the void volume which by W analysis indicated 11 12 equivalents of LTC4 per 100,000 daltons of KLH.D.

The reaction was stirred at room temperature and was followed by HPLC Whatman Partisil M9 10 25 ODS, eluting withMeOH H2O HOAc 70 30 0.01, 4 mL min . The adduct eluted at 4.8 min. and LTC4 eluted at 6.6 min.After 10 and 30 min. about 158 of unreacted LTC4 remained. More of the acid chloride solution 5 pL was added and after a further 10 min. 5 unreactedLTC4 remained. The reaction mixture was concentrated to 0.2 mL under a stream of N2, diluted with borate buffer pH 7.2, 0.1M, 0.5 mL and the residual methanol was removed in vacuo. This solution had W spectrum essentially unchanged fromLTC4 itself, and was used as such in reaction with thiolated KLH see following . C. Reaction of KLH with S Acetylmercapto succinic Anhydride KLH 60 mg was dissolved in borate buffer 0.2M, pH 8, 1.5 mL and centrifuged to remove denatured protein. The resultant solution analyzed for 24.6 mg mL by W E278 mg mL 1.36 . The solution was deoxygenated by three purges alternating high vacuum and pure N2 flush then treated under N2 with S acetylmercaptosuccinic anhydride 45 mg added in 5 mg portions over one hour . The pH was maintained at 8 by addition of 1N NaOH total 400 pL . After standing one hour more,N ethylmaleimide 20 mg in 0.1 mL MeOH was added to bind any free thiol groups and stabilize the solution to air.After standing 1.5 hours more the solution was centrifuged and applied to a column Sephadex G 50 1.5 x 75 cm eluting with 0.1N saline buffered with 0.01N pH 6.2 phosphate buffer. Two fractions 7 mL eluting after the void volume contained the bulk of the protein 2.4 mg mL . An aliquot analyzed for thiol content, after hydrolysis at pH 11.5 for one hour, indicated 18 thiol groups per 100,000 daltons protein.D. Coupling of 6 N Maleimidohexanoic Acid Amide of LTC4 and Thiolated KLH A solution of S acetylmercaptosuccinate derivative of KLH from reaction C 10.8 mg, in 4.5 mL 0.1N saline, buffered to pH 6.2 with 0.01N phosphate was rigorously deoxygenated and then the pH was raised to 11.5 with 1N NaOH 150 pL underN2 and the mixture was left at room temperature for one hour. The pH was then reduced to 7.2 by addition of deoxygenated 1N HC1 150 pL and the solution of the 6 N maleimidohexanoic acid amide derivative ofLTC4 from reaction B was added. After standing 2 hours at room temperature, N ethylmaleimide 1 mg in 10 pL methanol was added and the mixture was left one hour more at room temperature.This solution was applied to a Sephadex G 50 column 1.5 x 7.5 cm eluting with 0.1N saline buffered to pH 6 with 0.01N phosphate. The protein fraction eluted with 85 in 11 mL after the void volume. Unreacted reagents eluted at the dead volume 150 mL . The protein solution was adjusted to pH 7.2 with 1N NaOH for storage. Analysis of the protein solution by UV indicated 7 10 equivalents of LTC4 were coupled per 100,000 daltons protein. The conjugates of LTC4 with the proteinsBSA and RLH have been used to raise antibodies with rabbits, at a dose of 200 pg rabbit, approximately weighing 1 kg the antibodies specifically recognizeLeukotrienes C4, D4, and E4. A detailed description of the antibody production, specificity, and the use of these conjugates in an immunoassay for the leukotrienes follows. In addition to LTC4 and the specific proteins used, it will be appreciated that other leukotrienes, such as LTD4 and LTE4 can be conjugated with other antigenic proteins such as tetanus antigen, human serum albumin HSA , as well as diphtheriae toxide, tetanus antigen, and CRM 197 from coryne bacterium diphtheriae and other similar antigenic materials. EXAMPLE 3Immunization Using LTC4 Conjugates The following is the immunization regime used employing KLH maleimido LTC4 as the immunogen. Three 4 month old New Zealand White rabbits each received sub cutaneous injections at muitiple sites of 200 pg KLH LTC4 in complete Freunds adjuvant followed in three weeks by sub cutaneous infctions at multiple sites with 100 pg LKH LTC4 in ncomplete Freunds adjuvant . The rabbits were bl d 10 days after the second injection and every three weeks thereafter. When a significant decline in the level of antibody was observed, the animals were boosted with 200 pg KLH LTC4 in incompleteFreunds adjuvant and the animals bled again on the same schedule. The antigen BSA DNP LTC4 was employed in a solid phase immuno radioassay SPIRA in order to be used for the dectection of leukotrienes. Polyvinyl chloride 96 well microtiter plates Dynatech Laboratories were coated with antigen BSA DNP LTC4 by incubating 100 ijl aliquotes of the antigen at 0.1 mg protein ml in PBS for 18 h at 40C. The wells were washed three times with 200 ul PBS and then unreacted sites in the wells were blocked by incubating a 200 ul aliqout of 10 horse serum in PBS in the wells for 2 h at 220C. The wells were then washed three times with 200 ul ofPBS 1.5 H.S. 1.5 horse serum in PBS . One hundred 100 p1 of a reaction mixture containing a dilution of the immune or pre immune rabbit serum was added to the wells and the plates incubated for 4 h at 220C.The 100 ul reaction employed for the titration of rabbit serum consisted of 50 ul of dilutions of the sera in PBS 1.5 H.S. and 50 ul of PBS 1.5 H.S. For competition analysis this reaction mixture consisted of 50 ul of a dilution of immune serum in PBS 1.5H.S. which contained a limiting amount of leukotriene specific antibody and 50 ul of PBS 1.5. H.S.containing various concentrations of leukotrienes or chemically related compounds. This 100 ul reaction mixture was preincubated l h at 220C before it was added to the well of the microtiter plate. The wells of the microtiter plate were then washed three times with 200 ul PBS 1.5 H.S. and then 100 il of 125I labeled rabbit anti mouse F ab 2 fragments of rabbit anti mouse IgG H L in PBS containing 10 horse serum was added to the wells and the plates incubated 4 h at 220C.Approximately 2 X 104 cpm of the iodinated reagent was added to each well. After the incubation period, the wells were washed five times with 200 ul PBS 1.5H.S. and once with 200 ijl PBS. The wells were then cut from the plate and the radioactivity in each well was determined in a gamma counter. The advantage of this assay is that, although the rabbits were immunized withKLH maleimido LTC4, therefore antibodies are present in these animals against KLH, against the maleimido linker and against the hapten LTC4, however, antibodies directed against the KLH and the maleimido linker do not cross react or bind to theBSA or DNP linker of the material coated onto the the surface of the wells. Therefore the only antibodies that bind to the material coated on the wells LTC4 DNP BSA are directed against the LTC4. These rabbit LTC4 antibodies bind to theLTC4 portion of the conjugate and they in turn are detected by adding a second species of antibody 125I labeled goat anti rabbit antibodies . There antibodies are radio labeled with iodine and will bind to the rabbit antibodies which in turn are bound tontLTC4. The net result is, the X re antibodies directed against LTC4, the more radioactivity associated with the well. In order to determine if free LTC4 is in a biological sample, an aliquot is added to the plastic well. Some of this free LTC4 will bind to the rabbit anti LTC4 displacing if from the antigen coating which is bound to the surface. This results in a decrease in the number of counts 1251 bound to the surface of the well and by comparing this decrease to the decrease in a standard curve where known amounts of free LTC4 are added, the amount ofLTC4 in the sample can be determined. The other compounds described in Examples 1 and 2 can be similarly used in an assay system, as reagents. The antisera produced in rabbits by immunization with these conjugates can also be used in conjunction with radio labelled leukotrienes C4,D4, or E4 as the basis of a radioimmunoassay forLeukotrienes C4, D4, and E4. These conjugates are useful as chemical immunotherapeutic agents in the treatment various allergic and chronic inflammatory diseases of the skin, lung, and airways, including asthma, allergic rhinitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and skin diseases such as psoriasis and eczema. LTC4 ANTIBODY ASSAY In a standard Guinea Pig Ileum assay, 4 tissues were set up in 10 ml baths of Kreb s buffer with atropi , and pyrilamine both at 10 6M. Standard contractions were observed using 10 ul of 2.7 x 10 6 M LTC4 solution in a 10 ml bath, for a final concentration of 2.7 x 10 9 The standard response tension was 1.1 2.0 grams. 20 l of stock LTC4 solution was mixed with a varying amount 10 ul, 40 ul, 100 ul and 400 Frl of anti LTC4 serum rabbit . 1 ml of serum contained 7.9 x 10 9 M of specific anti LTC4 antibody . The serum was incubated on ice in the dark for 1 2 hour before use. Control samples were run using similar amounts of normal rabbit serum. The mixed samples 15 ul, 30 ul, 60 ul and 210 l respecitvely were added to baths and the response recorded. RESULTSVolume of Antibody Serum of Control Response 5 l 100.0 20 Frl 72.7 50 l 92.3 200 ul 64.7Volume of Normal Serum 5 l 108.6 20 ul 85.7 50 ul 102.6 200 ul 114.3 From the above results, clearly the anti LTC4 serum diminished the effect of LTC4 in each sample. Thus the conjugates can be used to raise antibodies to LTC4, LTD4, LTE4, in humans in a manner similar to that employed herein in rabbits . The resulting circulating levels of antibodies would serve to diminish plasma levels ofLTC4, and LTD4 and LTE4 released during an asthmatic anaphylactic response and thus serve to alleviate the symptoms. Since the antibodies would be present during long periods of time, this would represent a long term asthma therapy.

D. Coupling of compound IV with Bovine Serum Albumin BSA A solution of compound IV from step C 1.5 mg in dimethylformamide 0.5 mL was added to a solution of BSA 15 mg in 0.2N pH 8.5 borate buffer 0.75 mL and the mixture was allowed to stand in the dark under nitrogen and at room temperature for 4 days. The mixture was centrifuged and the clear supernatant was applied to a column of Sephadex G 50 1.5 x 75 cm eluting with water. The yellow protein fraction eluted cleanly in 20 mL, after the void volume of about 55 mL. At about the 140 mL dead volume a peak containing unreacted IV and byproducts eluted. W analysis of the protein fractions gave a spectrum max 266, sH , 273, 283, 336, 420 nn.Assuming 100 recovery of BSA from the column, calculations based on the peak at 273 nm, correcting for contributions due to BSA and to the dinitrobenzene chromophore, indicated that 5.5 moles of LTB4 were coupled per mole of BSA. The absorption at 336 nm assuming for the l,5 diamino 2,4 dinitrobenzene chromophor of about 27,000 indicated that 8.3 moles of LTB4 were coupled per mole BSA.2. Conjugation of LTB4 with Hemocyanin from Keyhole Limpets KLH LTB4 lactone VI 4 mg was dissolved in a mixture of THF 1 mL and 99 hydrazine hydrate 0.5 mL and the mixture was stirred vigorously under nitrogen at room temperature for 0.5 hours.

Reaction of LTB4 hydrazide VII with 6 N Maleimidohexanoic acid chloride LTB4 hydrazine VII 2.5 mg, 7 x 10 6 moles , in anhydrous methanol 1 mL and triethylamine 20 pL was treated with a solution of 6 N maleimidohexanoic acid chloride 8 3.3 mg, 1.4 x 10 5 moles in anhydrous THF 100 uL under nitrogen at room temperature. TLC analysis chloroform methanol, 85 15 indicated complete conversion to a less polar product. The mixture was reduced to dryness, and the residue was taken up in deoxygenated methanol 1.2 mL and used as such in the next reaction. The product could be purified if desired by reverse phase HPLC Waters 10p, p Bondapak C 18 methanol water 75 25, 2mL min , to give the pure adduct VIII eluting at 4.5 min.W max MeOH 6 260 36,300 , 270 50,00G , 280.5 nm 39,400 . On concentration to obtain PMR spectra some decomposition was noted by TLC. However the spectrum 400 MHz acetone d6 contained a weak signal at 6.82 ppm indicating that the malemide unit was present although partially reacted.C. Coupling of Compound VIII with Thiolated KLH S Acetylmercaptosuccinylated KLH was prepared as previously described 8 . The derivatized protein KLHSAc 10 mg in 0.1 N Saline buffered with 0.01 N pH 6.2 phosphate buffer PBS 5 mL was rigorously deoxygenated then the pH was raised to 11.5 by addition of 0.1N NaOH. After standing 1 hour nitrogen at room temperature, the pH was reduced to 7.2 by addition of 0.1N HC1. The adduct VIII in methanol 1.2 mL from reaction B above, was added and the mixture was stirred slowly under nitrogen for 18 hours. N ethylmalemide 5 mg in methanol 0.1 mL was added and the mixture was stirred 1 hour more. The methanol was removed under a stream of nitrogen during 1 hour, the mixture was centrifuged and the supernatant was filtered onSephadex G 50 eluting with pH 6.2 PBS. The protein eluted with 95 in 19 ml after the void volume and gave a W spectrum max 264 sH , 273.5, 283.5 nm. Assuming 9 mg of protein was recovered from the column and correcting the absorption at 273.5 nm for contributions due to coupled per 100,000 daltons KLH.
