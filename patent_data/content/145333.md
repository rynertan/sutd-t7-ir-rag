# Candida albicans cytoplasmic antigen, monoclonal antibodies against it and methods for the preparation.

## Abstract
Two novel hybridoma cell lines, ATCC HB 8397 and ATCC HB 8398 produce monoclonal antibody monospe cific to a single determinant shared by a set of three closely related cytoplasmic antigens of Candida albicans. The anti gens have molecular weights of 120 135 Kd, 48 52 Kd, and 35 38 Kd. The hybridomas are formed by fusing splenocytes from immunized BALB c mice with SP2 O Ag 14 myeloma cells. Monoclonal and monospecific, polyclonal antibodies to these cytoplasmic antigens find application in the im munodiagnosis of Candida infections. A procedure is provided for preparing partially purified cytoplasmic antigen of pathogenic Candida species for ad ministration to splenocyte donating mice. Also provided is a method for the biochemical purfication of cytoplasmic antigen of a pathogenic Candida species used for the preparation of monoclonal and monospecific, polyclonal antisera thereto.
