# A CLOSURE CAP

## Abstract
A linerless plastic closure cap 10 is provided for use with containers which require a very tight seal such as on carbonated beverage containers. This closure cap has sea ling flanges 30,32 and abutment surfaces 42,44 for limiting the sealing flange deflection. The sealing flanges 30,32 are provided with spaced vent slots 60 which function to gradually release the pressure in a beverage e.g. a carbonated beverage container as the closure cap 10 is removed. When the closure cap 10 is applied to a container, the sealing flanges 30,32 are deflected outwardly by engagement with the container neck 28 and this deflection is limited by the abutment surfaces 42,44 . A load stop ring 50 prevents deflecton of the seal flanges 30,32 due to top loading. The closure cap 10 is dimensioned relative to the container to provide a requisite amount of horizontal seal interference A,B between the container neck finish 28 and the sealing flanges 30,32 to ensure a proper seal thus providing a closure cap 10 useable on a wide variety of containers.
