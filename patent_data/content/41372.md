# CYCLE FRAME WITH BOTTLE

## Abstract
This invention relates to a cycle frame comprising a frame body 1 comprising a plurality of interconnected members 11 17 , comprising a head tube 11 , a top tube 12 and a down tube 13 both connected to said head tube 11 , a bottom bracket at the rear lower end of said down tube 13 a seat tube 15 connected at respective ends to said bottom bracket 14 and the rear end of the top tube 12 a rear fork 16 connected at one end at the junction of the seat tube 15 and the top tube 12 , and a chain stay 17 connected at respective ends to said bottom bracket 14 and said rear fork 16 . The frame body 1 has a first internal corner space 18 at the junction of said head tube 11 and the front end portions of said top tube 12 and down tube 13 , and second to fifth internal corner spaces 19 22 at other junctions of the frame members. A bottle mounting means is provided for mounting a beverage bottle 2 on said frame body 1 . Known such frames suffer from appreciable wind resistance leading to greater rider fatigue. According to the present invention the bottle 2 is mounted in a said internal corner space 18 22 of said frame body 1 , said bottle 2 having a body with a shape in side elevation formed for fitting closely in said corner space 18 22 between respective ones of said frame body members 11 17 at said corner space 18 22 , and having a width in said side elevation less than the height or length of said bottle 2 .
