A cable television system and method in which each subscriber s converter is located outside the subscriber s premises in an external control unit ECU which also includes several other subscribers converters. The ECU includes common signal processing circuitry for controlling all the converters in the ECU. In addition to television signals, the cable network transmits control and data signals in both directions between the ECU and the head end of the system and between the ECU and each subscriber.

Multiple television channels can be supplied to each subscriber via a single drop cable connecting the subscriber to the ECU.
