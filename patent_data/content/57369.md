# Valve support arrangement for a pressurizer vessel in a nuclear power plant.

## Abstract
A modularly constructable support arrangement is provided for pressurizer safety and relief valves in a nuclear power plant. A common header is supported by four sets of columnar legs which are secured to pressurizer vessel side wall lugs. The safety and relief valves are securely disposed and connected through short pipe runs to discharge steam into the header.
