# Apparatus for absorbing deflections for a bearing.

## Abstract
A journal bearing arrangement for a shaft 52 mounted in a ball bearing 62, 64 has the outer race 64 mounted in a bearing support member 76 which is itself mounted from a first support member 72 in a housing 58 through a damping section 74 consisting of alternate elastomeric washers 92 and non elastomeric spacers 94 . The support member 60 is supported within the housing 58 in a cantilever mounting which gives good damping and tends to maintain the shaft and housing coaxial in spite of lateral deflections of the shaft.
