# L HISTIDINE PRODUCING MICROORGANISMS

## Abstract
L histidine producing microorganisms are constructed by incorporating, into a recipient strain of the genus Bacillus, a recombinant plasmid containing a DNA fragment controlling resistance to a histidine antagonist, which DNA fragment is obtained from chromosomal DNA of a mutant of the genus Bacillus resistant to the histidine antagonist.
