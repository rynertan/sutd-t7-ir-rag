DESCHI PTION The present invention relates to a method of separating organic matter from its aqueous solution through chemical reactions among soluble organic contents therein. Various separation methods have been employed for this separation purpose, and typical examples are an activated sludge method, a granulation method, a membrane formation tecqnique and a chemical separation method. Either method specified above, however, carries certain disadvantages which may be a high installation cost, a high running cost, and or deterioration of separated organic matter.The present invention is directed toward solving the problems pointed out above, and an object of the present invention is to provide an improved method of separating organic matter from its aqueous solution capable of putting into practice in a usual manner irrespective of BODs of the aqueous solution to be treated, thereby eliminating the necessity of providing large scaled equipments, and also simplifying the operational procedures.Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved method of separating organic matter from its aqueous solution, capable of improving the recovery of the organic contents therein.Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved method of separating organic matter from its aqueous solution, capable of operating in an economical and accessible manner.According to one aspect of the present invention, there may be provided a method of separating organic matter from its aqueous solution which comprises admixing said aqueous solution with a mixture containing oxidases and metabolic products, and thereby developing chemical and or biological sludge forming through chem ical and or biological reactions among soluble organic contents therein and a subsequent formation of agglomerated product of asslining organic matter and said chemical and or biological sludge, thereafter allowing said agglomerated product to separate from said aqueous solution, said products produced through metabolism of bacteria which may be aerobic bacteria including zoogloea, or facultative anaerobic bacteria including lactic acid bacteria and bacillus, or alternatively, a bacteria mass in which both aerobic bacteria and facultative anaerobic bacteria specified above co exist.According to another aspect of the present invention, there may be provided a method of separating organic matter from its aqueous solution which comprises admixing said aqueous solution with additives, thereby developing chemical and or biological sludge forming through chemical anda or biological reactions anong soluble organic contents therein and a subsequent formation of an agglomerated product of remaining organic matter and said chemical and or biological sludge, thereafter allowing said agglomerated product to separate from said aqueous solution, said additives containing oxidases and organic substances showing analogous physical and chemical behaviours against organic matter in an aqueous solution to oxidases and metabolic products, said organic organic substances containing phenols, organic acids, polysaccharides, amino acids, and mixtures thereof, said metabolic products produced through metabolism of bacteria which may be aerobic bacteria including zoogloes, or facultative anaerobic bacteria including lactic acid bacteria and bacillus, or alternatively, a bacteria mass in which both aerobic bacteria and facultative anaerobic bacteria specified above co exist.Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following description when taken in connection with the accom panying drawings, which show, for the prupose of illustration only, an exemple of the separation system constructed in accordance with the present invention. Fig 1 is a flowchart showing a separation system according to the present invention. Now, referring to fig.1, the separation system for carrying out the present invention will he described. This separation system includes a reaction process 1, an additive feeding tank 2 and a separating process 3.A constant amount of an aqueous solution containing organic matter is, continuously or intermitently, introduced into the reaction process 1. At the same time, a mixture containing oxidases and metabolic products is introduced from the additive feeding lank 2 into the reaction process 1 wherein it is admixed with said aqueous solution under the slow agitation to form a mixture. The mixture is subjected to chemical, physical and or biological reactions for a relatively short period of time, thereby forming separable solid products.The mixture containing said solid products is then fed into the separating process 3 to be separated into a liquid portion and a solid portion. The liquid portion is discharged as a treated water while the solid portion is taken out of the system.The metabolic products to he fed may be those contained in the sludgy matter for in the course of the biological treatment of an aqueous solution contain ing organic matter, or those contained in tie hums procursors.Bactoria, working at tlle organic matter in an aqueous solution to produce meta bolic products, may be aerobic bacteria including zoogloen, or facultative ana erobic bacteria including lactic acid bacteria and bacillus, or alternatively, a bacteria mass in which both aerobic bacteria and facultative anaerobic hac teria specified above co exist.The effectiveness of the bacteria mentioned above is derived from the fact that these bacteria, Whether they may he aerobic or facultative anaerobic, can produce metabolic products, such as phenols, organic acids, polysaccharides, amino acids and or oxidases. The products are produced through metabolism of bacteria in the condition which enables them to work effectively under the presence of oxygen. It has been found out that the bacterial metabolic products exibit effective physical and cllemicl behaviours against the soluble organic contents in an aqueous solution.The term humus precursors as used herein means intermediate products produced in the course that organic matter is biodegraded into humus. They substantially contain phenols, organic acids, polysaccharides, their partly polycondensed products and or oxidases, which corresponds to said metabolic products. The humus precursors specified above can be easily extracted from in a desired state from lignite, peat, grass peat, or humified matter which is a mixture of humus precursors and humus. The metabolic products are usually supplied to the reaction process l in the form of sludgy matter or humus precursors for their accessability, although the effective use of the metabolic products, which are possibly extracted from said sludgy matter and materials containing humtis precursors through such an extractant as a distilled water, a weak acid and an inorganic solvent, is feasible.The expected physical and chemical reactions in tlie reaction process 1 oc cur first hetween a mixture containing oxidases and metabol ic products and soluble organic contents in an aqueous solution to form a chemical and or biological sludge, and further allow remaining organic matter and said chemical and or biological sludge to form an agglomerated productl.The physical and chemical reactions include, for example, the netitralization of electric charges adsorb tion and absorption molecular conglomeration, such as molecular bond, granu lation, condensation, and polymerization sludgy beeoming tendency, massed sludge, and any other synergic reactions. The chemical reactions according to the present invention, however, don t include an enzymatic degradation of organic matter. In the former increased are molecular sizes of remaining organic matter, while not increased in the latter.A period of time for reactions in the reaction process 1 is normally a few minutes, but sometimes it may take more than 100 minutes. If the reactions are continued for an excessively long period of time, and accordingly, the mixture is caused to stay in the reaction process 1 too long, self digestion is likoly to occur, thereby rest I ting in an undesirable Increase of soluble organic content. A so heating up the mixture to be at a temperature of 50 C or less helps developing tie reactions. These have been experimentally ascertained.The use of additives containing oxidases and specific organic compounds, which show analogous physical and chemical bohaviours against the organic matter in an aqueous solution to the bacterial metabolic products specified previously, is also feasible, as inferable from the foregoing description. The s.ific organic compounds are a mixture of compounds selected from the group consisting of phnols, organic acids, polysaccharides, amino acids, and mixtures thereof. The control of pH value in the range 5.0 to 7.5 and the moderate agitation of the reaction mixture in the reaction process 1 rearkahly develop the reactions between the soluble organie contents in the aqueous solution and a mixture con taining oxidases and metabolic producls, accodingly leading to the fixation of the substances which give out putrid smell when they are free.In the separating process 3, said agglomerated product is allowed to separate from said aqueous solution. The liquid portion after separation is discharged out of the system as a treated water. The separation can he carried out by a solid liquid separator of all types, such as a precipitator, a continuous filter of rotary drum type and a dehydrator.The experiments indicate that a mixture containing oxidases and metabolic products function as an initiator to progress the reactions among soluble organic contents in an aqueous solution to he treated. and accordingly, only a slight amount of said mixture is required to he added thereto. The experiments also indicate that the mixture concentration less than 200 ppm in the aqueous solu tion, slightly changeable according to the concentration of the soluhle organic contents present therein, normally gives satisfactory results.To exemplify the present invention for better understanding, the following example2 when applittd to the sewage trcatnent, is given. Arrangements The sewage A human urine. Tile COD Chemical Oxygen Demand was 5700 ppm. The amount of supply to the reaction process was 10 n day for 10 hours operation a day. The pli value of the sewage was adjust ed to be about 6.5 under the presence of aeration, folowed by agitation, in the sewage storing tank. The metabolic products A filtrate, comprising about 2 of humus precursors containing oxidases. separated by a high pressure filler from a mixture con sisting equally of water and humified matter. The volumetric feed rate to the reaction process was 0.1 m day. The reaction process A moderate agitation was performed. The residence time of the mixture was 1 minute. The separating process A continuous filter of rotary drum type was employed. A filtrate was further filtered by mans of a precoat filter with diatomace ous earth. The COl at the outlet of this process was 150 ppm. The secondary process An adsorption treatment by active carbon was performed. The COD of the effluent was less than 10 ppm. Under the arrangements mentioned above, a sewage treatment in accordance with the present invention was carried out. The total amount of air required for effecting the aeration was 0 m per day, and the total aeration power required was 7.5 KwH 0.75 Kw installation power x 10 hours For comparison, the sewage of the same conditions was treated under the con ventional activated sludge method. The amount of air required for aeration was 4875 m day for 60m3 BOD Kg, and tlle required acration power was 132 Kwll 5.5 Kw installation power x 24 hours As evident from the foregoing description, according to the present invention the aeration power can be considerably reduced without sacrificing the effec tivenes. of sewage treatment, as contrast to the conventional activated sludge method. This assures the reduced cost. In addition, it is no longer necessary to dilute the sewage to be treated previously if it is highly condensed. This eliminates the necessity of providing the equipments for storing and circulating the diluting water, wheret y the sewage treatment can be carried out even in a relatively restricted area or site. Accordinly, it is assured that the sewage treatment can be practised in an economical and accessible manner. The reduced aeration also prevents soluble organic contents in the sewage from decomposing by oxidization, thereby recovering organic matter present therein effectively. and at the same time increasing the organic contents in the sludge to he finally separated.
