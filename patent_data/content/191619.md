# AUTOMATIC LINEAR COMPRESSION CIRCUIT

## Abstract
An automatic linear compression circuit for a telephone handsfree loudspeaker is provided. The circuit consists of a variable attenuator the level of attenuation of which is con trolled by the input signal level. The input signal is passed through a positive peak detector to obtain a time averaged sig nal corresponding to the average positive peak values of the in put signal and this time average signal is compared against a time increasing reference voltage. As long as the reference vol tage is below the value of the time averaged signal a positive attenuator control signal is derived. This positive control signal keeps the attenuator portion of the circuit operative. In the at tenuator the input voltage is sampled to a first capacitor. The first capacitor is subsequently connected to and disconnected from a second capacitor a number of times as long as the posi tive attenuator control signal is present. Each time this is done the voltage on the first capacitor is reduced by a factor depend ing on the capacitances of the two capacitors. After a predeter mined time the voltage remaining on the first capacitor is passed through buffers and another capacitor to provide an attenuated output. The circuit is simple and flexible, permitting wide ranges in the operating parameters to be achieved simply by including one or more variable capacitors.
