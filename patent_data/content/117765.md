# INCINERATORS, AND GASIFIERS AND BURNERS FORMING PART OF SAME

## Abstract
A gasifier for generating a producer gas output from a cel lulosic waste material input has an axially aligned top fuel feed 20 down onto a conical grate 40 with provision for removing fuel pile ash from around the base perimeter 46 of the grate. A preferred embodiment includes means 20, 30, 32 for ad justing the fuel feed above the level of the grate and to control underfire admission air through plenums 50A to 50E from beneath the grate so as to control the fuel pile size. An annular top opening 16 is provided for guiding producer gas from the chamber. A producer gas burner 300 has a cyclonic com bustion chamber 320 with an upper inlet 352 for spirally di recting producer gas down into the chamber and secondary combustion air inlet means 342 at the lower end of the cham ber for directing secondary air tangentially and upwardly into the chamber. An exhaust outlet 334 is disposed at the lower end of the chamber with an exhaust inlet 330 axially aligned with the chamber. In a preferred embodiment, the gasifier and burner are combined using a double scrolled duct 400 to trans port producer gas from the gasifier to the burner, and the gasi fier and burner share a common ash removal system 500.
