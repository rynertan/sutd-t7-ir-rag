# Improvements in or relating to shower fittings.

## Abstract
The invention relates to shower fittings especially those used in the paper and board making industries. The shower fitting incorporates at least one jet for direct ing on to a surface a jet of liquid which is suitable for clean ing and or reconditioning the surface. The jet or jets are normally mounted in a tube to which the liquid is supplied and which is reciprocated across the surface to ensure that the entire width of the surface is treated and to avoid damage to the surface that might result if a jet of liquid is directed constantly at the same area of the surface. The invention is concerned with the problem of en suring adequate support and protection for the tube. In one particular embodiment, the tube 1 is mounted for reciprocation inside a support tube 3. Support bushes 2 spaced along the axial length of the tube 1 ensure ade quate support whilst protection is provided by the outer tube 3. The tube 1 carries a plurality of jets 7 and the outer tube has a slot 13 aligned with the jets 7 to allow liquid emerging from the latter to reach the surface. Driving means for example an hydraulically actuated motor 10 is mounted at one end of the outer tube 3 and is connected to the inner tube 1 to reciprocate the latter. Treatment liquid is supplied to the inner tube 1 via one end thereof.
