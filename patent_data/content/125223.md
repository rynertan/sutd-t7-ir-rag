# A method for producing lead from sulphidic and oxidic and or sulphatic lead raw materials.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method for producing lead from moist lead sulphide concentrates and oxidic and or sulphatic lead raw materials by the known roasting and reaction pro cess. According to the method granules or pellets of oxidic and or sulphatic lead raw materials are brought together with the moist lead concentrate in a drum like vessel arranged for rotation about its longitudinal axis. Said moist concentrate is dried while rotating said drum like vessel to form sulphide containing granulates. The formed granulates are introduced into a furnace together with flux in given proportions. The charge is vigorously agitated and turbulence created in the resultant melt, while effecting the roasting and reaction pro cess to form a liquid slag and a molten lead phase. Both the drying and the smelting may be provided in the same unit if a top blown rotary converter is employed.
