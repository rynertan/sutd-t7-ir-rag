# Tracer control apparatus.

## Abstract
The apparatus has a memory MEM holding data e.g. start point A, tracing turning points X1, X2 pick feed quantity P, tracing end position Y1, automatic return posi tion Z1 determining a tracer machining operation to be effected. In particular the memory MEM holds clamp tracing data setting an initial clamp level CPL for a first clamp tracing operation, and data ΔCPL setting further clamp levels CPL ΔCPL for further clamp tracing opera tions. A processor CPU reads out the data from the memory MEM and applies control signals to the control led tracer machining apparatus from D A converters, DA1, DA2 and from clamp feed command circuit CLP to cause the machining apparatus to effect successive clamp trac ing operations at progressively changing clamp levels, so that automatic machining operations can be carried out continuously from rough to finish machining.

## Description
TRACER CONTROL APPARATUS This invention relates to tracer control apparatus. In clamp tracing in accordance with conventional tracer control, for example as shown in Fig. 1 of the accompanying drawings, which is sectional diagram illustrating schematically clamp tracing of a model surface, a limit switch LS is provided at a selected depth D in relation to a model MDL to be traced, at which depth clamp tracing is to be effected which depth will hereinafter be referred to as a clamp level .When the limit switch LS is turned ON by the movement of the tracer head, feed in the direction of depth of the model MDL is terminated and a tracing stylus is then moved horizontally without contacting the surface of the model MDL until tracing is re started from the position at which the stylus again contacts the surface of model MDL Upon completion of one machining operation, the position of the limit switch is changed, for example it is lowered by a predetermined amount fiD to a position LSt, whereupon clamp tracing takes place again at a new depth D so that the workpiece is cut again by a predetermined amount corresponding to LµD By repeating such operations, the configuration of the model MDL is finally traced out down to its greatest depths Thus, since conventional control calls for a limit switch, the reliability of clamp tracing operations is relatively low because of the mechanical nature of the operation of the limit switch, and since the position of the limit switch must be changed after each machining operation, it is difficult to continue machining operations from rough to finished workpiece without significant breaks, and thereby working time is extended According to the present invention there is provided tracer control apparatus, characterised by a memory holding data determining tracer machining operations to be effected, including clamp tracing data designating an initial clamp level to be applied in a first clamp tracing operation, andiata determining successive further clamp levels for successive further clamp tracing operations, a processor operable to read out the data held in the memory, and in dependence upon read out data, to apply control signals to tracer machining apparatus such as to cause the machining apparatus to effect initial and successive clamp tracing operations in accordance with the stored clamp tracing data.

In Fig. 3, the tracing turning points Lp and LN see Table 1 are X1 and X2 the pick feed quantity AOB is P the tracing end position LTE is VI the automatic return position LRp is Zi and the clamp level initial position COT is CPL and the stylusST is controlled by data concerning the velocity and direction of tracing and so on so that it approaches a point a from a starting point A and traces the model surface following aroute a b c ... u v indicated in Figure 3 to effect clamp tracing in the sections a to b, c to d, .. t to u and then to return automatically from the tracing end position Yl to the automatic return position ZT. In this case, the tracing operation is controlled in accordance with a flowchart such as is depicted in Fig. 4. Upon depression of an approach button not shown , the processor CPU reads out data on the axis, direction and velocity of approach from the memory MEAt and provides a signal via the data output unit DO to the analog gate circuit GC to activate the amplifier DRVZ, causing the servo motor MZ to lower the . tracer head TR and the cutter CT. The velocity in this case can be determined by velocity data F supplied via the data output unit DO to the D A converter DA2. Before the stylus ST is brought into contact with the model MDL, the displacement signals xa 6 y and are zero, and accordingIy the difference is equal to the reference deflection signal F When the composite displacement signal has become equal to the deflection signal O as a result of contacting of the stylus ST with the model MDL, the comparator COMP detects that E 0 , and applies an approach end signal AE to the data input unit DI. The approach end signal AE is read by the processor CPU to detect the completion of approach, and then tracing is started. Upon the commencement of tracing the processor CPU reads out data concerning the mode, the reference deflection gOs the direction and velocity of tracing, to start tracer control. The reference deflection data is converted by D A converter DA1 into an analog deflection signal Q for input to the adderADD, and the servo motor MX Cin the case of operation as shown in Fig. 3 is driven in a direction in accordance with the directio of tracing dataFurther, the processor CPU reads owt the clamp level initial position CPL from the memory MEM and compares it with the content of the reversible counter CNTZ representing the current depth position of the stylusST. When it is detected by such comparison that the content of the reversible counter CNTZ and the clamp level initial position Cp , match each other, the processor CPU sends out, by an interrupt operation, a start signal CL, via the data output unit DO, to the clamp feed command circuit CLP to start that circuit and, at the same time, changes over the gate circuit GC so that it passes on a clamp feed command signal from the clamp feed command circuit CLP to a predetermined one of the servo motors. By means of these operations, the stylus ST does not.effect further tracing but instead is moved in a horizontal direction, and clamp feed takes place at a predetermined clamp level. During the clamp feed, since the displacement signals 6 y and z of the stylus ST are zero, the difference signal A t is equal to the deflection signal eO, but when the stylus ST again gets into contact with the model MDL at the end of clamp feed , the composite displacement signal t becomes equal to the deflection signal 0, with the result that the difference signal Lit becomes zero.Upon detection of t O, the comparator COMP applies the approach end signal AE to the data input unit DI, and the processor CPU reads this approach end signal AE to detect that the stylus ST has. been brought into contact with the model MDL by the clamp feed.Then, the processor CPU terminates operation of the clamp feed command circuit CLS via the data output unit DO and changes over the gate circuit GC to end clamp feed, restoring the above described tracing operations Further, the processor CPU reads out tracing turning positions Lp and LN from the memory MEM and compares theme with the content of the counter CNTX in the case of Fig 3 . For example, in tracing in a minus direction , when the content of the reversible counter CNTX and tracing turning position LN match each other, the tracer feed axis is changed over and the processor CPU reads out data such as direction, velocity and quantity of pick feed P to control pick feed. When the content of the reversible counter CNTY in the case of Fig. 3 becomes equal to the pick feed quantity P in the course of the pick feed operation, the processor CPU causes the stylus ST to turn again,. that is, controls it to trace in a plus direction . Further, the processor CPU checks whether or not the stylus ST has reach the tracing end position, and upon detecting that a tracing end position LTE has been reached. during pick feed, the processor CPU reads out automatic return data e.g. automatic return velocity and automatic return position LRp, from the memory MEM Since automatic return is ON, the servo motor MZ is driven. and when. the content of the reversible counter CNTZ reaches the automatic return position W , one tracer control operation has been completed. In the event that repetitive tracing has been preset by the input from the keyboard KB, for example, the processor CPU returns the stylus ST by known positioning control to the approach starting point A immediately following the automatic return operation, and then carrys out clamp tracing again In this case, the clamp level is set at CpL CpL which is the sum of the aforesaid clamp level position CPG and a clamp level variation tKCpL prestored in. the memory MEM which is determined in. consideration of the cutting performance of the tool used.Since the repetitive clamp tracing can be effected by changing the clamp level automatically for each working operation as described above, it is possible to achieve machining operations continuously from rough to finish machining, thereby markedly reducing the machining time A maximum clamp level depth, beyond which clamp level cannot go, can also be set. see clamp level final position CpLE in Table The tracing. turning positions LP and LN, the tracing end position.LTE,. the automatic return position LRp, the pick feed P, the clamp level initial position Cpt, the clamp level variation. CPL. and. the clamp level final position CPLE may also be obtained by setting in the memory MEM the contents of the reversible counters after the stylus ST has been shifted to those respective positions in a manual feed mode, instead of entering the data from the keyboard KB. Also, during a tracingoperation a tracing path, including a clamp level therefor, can be corrected by reloading the data in the memory MEM. For example, the data in the memory MEM is read out therefrom and displayed on display DSP and the data is corrected and reloaded by manipulation of the keyboard KB. Thus, the clamp tracing start position, i.e the clamp level initial position CpL, the clamp level variation t CPL and the clamp level finish position CPLE can be corrected with ease. In the apparatus described above, all data defining a tracing operation is prestored in a memory for controlling a tracing path, including a clamp feed path, but it need not be the case for all embodiments of the present invention, that all the data is always prestored for example, tracing turning position and the like may also be controlled by a limit switch. As has been described above, apparatus embodying the present invention permits repetitive clamp tracing by providing for an automatic change in the clamp level, by a predetermined value, for each working operation, in accordance with prestored data concerning clamp tracing, and consequently, automatic machining operations can be carried out continuously from rough to finish machining with consequent reduction in working time. It will be apparent that many modifications and variations may be effected without departing from the scope of the novel concepts of this invention. Thus, apparatus embodying this invention can effect tracer control by calculating the direction and the velocity of tracing through utilization of signals from a tracer head tracing the model surface, and the apparatus is provided with an input unit for entering data defining a tracing operation, a memory for storing the entered data and a processor for reading out the entered data from the memory to control respective parts of a tracer control machine. Data concerning clamp tracing is read out by the processor to change the clamp level by a predetermined value after each tracer machining operation, thereby performing repetitive clamp tracing
