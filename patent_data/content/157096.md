# Winding mechanism for tape like web.

## Abstract
An improved winding mechanism for a rolled tape like web such as a composite label web, a composite tag web or a carbon ribbon, for example, in a label printing machine or the like. With the winding mechanism, the slackening or stretching of the tape like web can be avoided when same is wound up from a feeding section B to a winding section A . The winding mechanism is provided with a transmitting means 10 to transmit force, which is opposite to the direc tion of the feeding of the tape like web to the feeding section and a braking device 19 in which braking members are urged towards each other by a spring force and comprise different coefficients of friction. The braking device is attached to the feeding section or both the feeding section and the winding section. Preferably, said transmitting means is a helical spring belt which is stretched around a winding pulley and a feeding pulley, said braking device is fitted between the feeding pulley and a feeding shaft for a tape like web.
