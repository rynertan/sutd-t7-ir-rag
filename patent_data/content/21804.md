# Vascular clamp.

## Abstract
A vascular clamp for use in surgery has a body 10 in the form of a tapering flexible envelope, with an inlet tube 18 at the broader end. An external strip 20 at the broader end provides a slot through which the tail 16 of the envelope can be threaded after passing it around the vessel 34 . The envelope is then inflated, e.g. by a syringe 32 , to compress the vessel. A tap 26 closes the inlet tube after inflation, and can be operated to partially deflate the envelope and so check for leaks of blood.
