## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1 Field of the invention The present invention relates to a novel process for production of adriamycin, a potent antitumor agent, which consists of biochemically converting other anthracycline compounds to adriamycin. 2 Description of the prior art A fermentative method for production of adriamycin in which Streptomyces peucetius subsp. caesius ATCC 27952 has been described in U.S.P. 3,590,028. A chemical process for preparation of adriamycin from daunomycin has been disclosed in U.S.P. 3,803,124.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a novel process for production of adriamycin. More particularly, it relates to a process for production of adriamycin which consists of biochemically converting an anthracycline compound presented by formula I EMI2.1 wherein R1 is ethyl, 1 hydroxyethyl or ethyl and R2 is a hydrogen atom or methyl but, when R1 is ethyl, RÃª is methyl, to adriamycin presentd by formula II EMI2.2 in the presence of the mycelium or its processed matters of a streptomycete having such conversion ability whereby adriamycin is isolated and purified by conventional methods.DETAILED DESCRPTION OF THE INVENTION Adriamycin is an anthracycline antibiotic having a potent and broad anti tumour activity and has widely been used as a valuable chemotherapeutic agent in the clinical treatment of tumors. In the course of detailed studies on the biosynthesis of the anthracycline family of antibiotics by using various anthracycline producing organisms and their mutants, the present authors have reported a biosynthetic route of daunomycin from aklavinone via i rhodomycinone and 13 deoxodaunomycin for example1 J. Antibiotics Vol.33, 1158 1193 1980 . Based on these findings, the present authors have continued their studies to develop a more advantageous process for production of adriamycin. The present invention depends on a discovery that adriamycin can be produced more efficiently by a biochemical conversion method in which an anthracycline antibiotic presented by formula I substrate typical examples of such compounds are listed in Table 1 is treated under nonreproductive conditions with the culture or its processed matters of a known adriamycin producing organism or its mutants Table 1EMI4.1 tb SEP I tb SEP 1 tb Compounds SEP i SEP SEP R2 SEP Reference tb SEP SEP SEP 1 SEP SEP tb Dallnomycin SEP COCH3 SEP 1 SEP CH3 SEP Listed SEP above. tb SEP .

It is more advantageous, however, to use adriamycin producing streptomycetes or their mutant strains. Favorable examples of such streptomycetes are Streptomyces peucetius subsp. caesius ATCC 27952,Streptomyces peucetius subsp. carneus ATCC 21354 and their mutants that produce no anthracycline type pigments. Such mutant strains can be obtained by conventional mutation methods such as treatment with mutagens for example, nitrosoguanidine, diepoxyethane and nitrite and irradiation of ultraviolet light or alpha , gammaor X ray. A method for isolation of useful mutants for the present invention is more concretely explained in the following A loopful of spores were collected from an agar slant culture of Streptomyces peucetius subsp. caesiusATCC 27592 and were inoculated into a test tube containing 5 ml of YS broth 0.3 yeast extract, 1 soluble starch pH 7.2 . After shaking cultivation for 2 days at 280C on a reciprocal shaker, the culture was treated for 30 seconds in a sonicator Tomy Seiko UR 200P , passed through a sterile glass tube 1.5 x 2.0 cm containing cotton and then centrifuged for collection of the cells.The cells were suspended in 5 ml of 0.1 MTris HCl buffer, pH 8.5, containing 1 mg ml N methyl N nitro N nitrosoguanidine and were kept shaken for one hour at 28 0C. The precipitate recovered by centrifugation was suspended in 5 ml of physiological saline and, if necessary after appropriate dilution with the saline, spread on YS agar plates YS broth 1.5 agar for colony isolation. The agar plates were incubated at 280C for 5 days. Each colony was inoculated on a YS agar slant and into a test tube containing 3 ml of YS broth described above . The test tubes were shakecultured at 28 C for 2 days and the whole culures were transferred into 250 ml flasks containing 30 ml of fermentation medium having the composition described below.The flasks were incubated at 28 0C for 5 days on a rotary shaker.Fermentation medium Sucrose 5 Soybean meal ESUSAN MEAT Ajinomoto Co. 2 Corn steep liquor 0.2 Yeast extract 0.2 Dipotassiur phosphate 0.1 7O Magnesium sulfate 0.05 Calcium carbonate 0.2 To Mineral solution 0.2 pH 7.4 Mineral solution 2.8 g CuSO4.5H2O, 0.4 g FeSO4 7H2O, 3.2 g MnCl2 4H2O and 0.8 g ZnSO4.7H2O were dissolved in 500 ml of water. The culture broth 5 ml was mixed with 5 ml of a mixture of chloroform and methanol 3 2 and was vigorously agitated on a mixer. It was easy to separate anthracycline nonproducers from producers, because anthracycline producers gave orange to red chloroform extracts, whereas nonproducers did colorless ones. Selected nonproducing strains were cultured in YS medium as described above and then were used as inocula to seed fermentation medium 30 ml medium 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask . After cultivation for 4 days, 0.3 ml of daunomycin chloride solution 1 mg ml was added to the culture final cencentration 10 pg ml and was incubated for a further 2 days. By mixing 5 ml of the culture with 5 ml of a chloroform methanol mixture 3 2 under vigorous agitation, the products were extracted into the chloroform layer. The chloroform extract was separated and concentrated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in 2 ml of 0.1 N HCl and then hydrolyzed at 850C for 30 minutes to give aglycones anthracyclinones .The aglycones were transferred into 0.1 ml of toluene under shaking. The microlitters of the toluene extract was spotted on a silica gel thin layer plate. For comparison, authertic samples of adriamycinone, daunomycinone and dihydrodaunomycinone were spotted on the same plate. The silica gel thin layer chromatographic layer was developed in a solvent system of benzene acetone formic acid 100 30 1 . By visually comparing the amounts of adriamycinone on silica gel thin layer plates, strains having a good efficiency of adriamycin production were selected. Using the above described method, those skilled in the art can easily obtain mutant strains suitable for the present invention which have an ability to biochemically convert an anthracycline compound presented by formula I to adriamycin presented by formula II . Typical mutants capable of such conversion which were fostered by the above explained method include mutant strains obtained from adriamycin producing streptomycetes by mutagen treatment. One of such favorable strains is mutant 2N 267 ATCC 31847 that was fostered by the present authors. This mutant 2N 267 and the parent strain Strepto myces peucetius subsp. caesius ATCC 27952 are morphologically and culturally identical, except that the former produces no antHracycline antibiotic, and no soluble pigments in various agar media presumably because of some mutation in the biosynthesis of anthracycline.Microbiological Properties of Streptomyces Peucetius subsp. Caesius 2N 267 1. Morphology Under a light microscope, one observes hooked aerial mycelia or incomplete spirals developed from well branched substrate mycelium. No whorl is seen.

The present authors has designated this mutantStreptomyces peucetius subsp. caesius 2N 267, and, according to the Budapest Treaty, has been placed on permanent deposit with the culture collection of theAmerican Type Culture Collection on March 18, 1981 accession number ATCC 31847 . Cultures or mycelia of the strains employed in the present invention are obtained by aerobically cultivat ing in nutrient media, and more advantageously are collected by means such as centrifugation at a stage later than the logarithmic phase of growth. In practice, it is most preferable to collect cells in the stationary phase of growth, because they are superior in the cell yield and in the ability to convert said anthracycline antibiotics to adriamycin. For cell production, various nutrient sources commonly employed for cultivation of streptomycetes such as carbohydrates, nitrogen sources and mineral salts are usable. For example, carbohydrates such as glucose, glycerol, maltose, sucrose, molasses, dextrin and starch other carbon sources such as fats and oils soybean oil, peanut oil, lard, etc. nitrogen sources such as peptone, meat extract. soybean meal, cotton seed meal, dry yeast, corn steep liquor, yeast extract, skim milk, casein, sodium nitrate, ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate mineral salts such as dipottasium phosphate, sodium chloride, calcium carbonate and magnesium sulfate and if necessary, trace elements such as cobalt and manganese are favorably added to media. Nutrient media are usually sterilized before inoculation. It is advisable to adjust the pH of media to 4 9, preferably to 6 8, before or after sterilization. The cultivation is advantageously conducted in aerobic conditions usually under agitaion with or without forced aeration Although the microorganisms can be grown in liquid media under standing culture, shaking culture and submerged culture, it is most preferred to carry out the submerged fermentation in the present invention. blecelia produced as described above are separated from broth filtrates by conventional methods such as sentrifugation and filtration and then washed and suspended in appropriate buffer solutions of pH 6 9 which do not substantially damage the conversion activity of mycelia, for example, 0.1 M Tris HCl, pH 8.5. In a modified conversion method of the present invention, washed mycelia harvested as described above are favorably treated by conventional methods such as enzyme digestion and sonication to an extent in which the surface structure of cells are not affected. For mycelium digestion, enzymes derived from animal and microbial cells such as lysozyme, muramidase andLytic Enzyme registered trade mark Kyowa Hakko Co.,Ltd. are usable. Processing conditions for enzymatic digestion of mycelia may be chosen from a wide range depending on the properties of mycelia and enzyme and the enzyme activity.In practice, 0.01 1 mg ml final concentration of the enzyme is added to a suspension of 10 30 g wet weight 100 ml of the mycelia in a suitable buffer and is allowed to stand at a temperature of 20 37 C for a period of 1 2 hours. The processed mycelia are collected by conventional methods such as centrifugation and are used for conversion of anthracycline antibiotics to adriamycin. In conversion reactions of anthracycline antibiotics presented by formula I to adriamycin presented by formula II , the reaction conditions such as the concentration of substrate anthracycline antibiotics , temperature, period and pH may vary in a wide range depending on the properties and amount of the mycelia or their processed matters employed. It is easy for those skilled in the art to determine optimal reaction conditions for the particular mycelia or their processed matters by running a small scale experiment. It is usually advisable to execute the conversion reaction according to the present invention by vigorously agitating 10 100 ,ug ml final concentration of an anthracycline antibiotic presented by formula I in a suspension of mycelia or their processed matters in a buffer solution of pH 6 9 at a temperature of 20 370C for a period of 15 48 hours. As responsible enzyme reactions are assumed to require oxygen, the appropriate aeration improves the conversion yield and shortens the period of reaction. As the conversion activity of mycelia or their processed matters in the present invention is stabilized by the presence of magnesium ions, it is advantageous to add magnesium chloride or magnesium sulfate to reaction mixtures. The optimal concentration of magnesium ions is usually in the range of 1 10 mM. Buffer solutions of pH 6 9 for the present invention may have a concentration in the range commonly used in most enzymes, but advantageously contain no phosphate ion. After conversion reaction, the reaction mixture is centrifuged to give mycelia and a supernatant. As adriamycin produced by the conversion reaction is present mostly in mycelia, it is extracted from the mycelia with acetone, methanol, n butanol or the like. Adriamycin in the supernatant solution, on the other hand, is extracted with chloroform, ethyl acetate, methyl acetate, toluene or other organic solvents. The solvent extracts recovered from the mycelia and the supernatant were combined and then concentrated to dryness to give a reddish brown preparation of crude products.Adriamycin is isolated and purified by a suitable combination of conventional methods such as column chromatography on silica gel, alumina gel, Sephadex LH 20 Pharmacia FineChemicals, A,B., Sweden , weakly acidic or weakly basic ion exchange resins, ion exchange celluloses and the like preparative thin layer chromatography on silica gel high performance liquid chromatography and counter current distribution. The identity with the authentic sample of adriamycin of the product obtained by the present invention was confirmed by ultraviolet and visible spectroscopy, infra red spectroscopy, silica gel thin layer chromatography of the aglycone in several solvent systems aglycone was obtained by hydrolysis in 0.1 N HCl at 800C for 30 minutes silica gel 60 F254 E. Merck, Darmstadt and qualitative sugar analysis of the acid hydrolysate daunosamine was detected in the acid hydrolysate by the method described in J. Antibiotics 32, 801 819 1979 .

Unless specified otherwise, the percentage in the present invention is expressed in the weight volume base. The seed culture was prepared by inoculating a loopful of spores of Streptomyces peucetius subsp. caesius 2N 267 from the slant culture into a 500 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 50 ml of the sterile medium specified above, and shake culturing the flask for 48 hours at 28 C on a rotary shaker 230 rpm . Sucrose 5,0 Soybean meal ESSUSAN MEAT see above 2.0 Corn steep liquor 0.2 Yeast extract 0.2 Dipotassium phosphate 0.1 Magnesium sulfate 0.05 70 Calcium carbonate 0.2 Mineral solution see above 0.2 pH 7.4 The above specified medium 5 liters were prepared and distributed in 50 ml volumes into 500 ml Erlenmeyer flasks. After sterilization, 1 ml each of the abovedescribed seed culture was inoculated to the flasks and incubated at 280C for 84 hours on a rotary shaker 230 rpm . The mycelia were collected from the broth by centri fugation Xashed with a suitable volume of 0.1 M Tris HCl buffer, pH 8.5 and suspended in 5 liters of the buffer.Fifty milliliters each of the mycelium suspension was distributed in 500 ml Erlenmeyer flasks. One milliliter each of 0.5 mg ml of daunomycin hydrochloride solution was added to the flasks total amount of daunomycin 50 mg and the flasks were incubated at 28 0C for 20 hours on a rotary shaker. After reaction, the mycelia were separated from the supernatant solution by centrifugation. Adriamycin in the supernatant was extracted twice with 2 liters each of chloroform, while the product in the mycelia was done twice with 2 liters each of acetone.The acetone extracts were combined and concentrated to a small volume under reduced pressure. Adriamycin was extracted twice from the concentrate with 1 liter each of chloroform. The chloroform extracts from the mycelia and from the supernatant were combined and concentrated under reduced pressure to give tar. The above described crude tarry matter was dissolved in a small volume of chloroform applied in a iinear fashion 1.5 cm from the bottom edge on preparative silica gel thin layer plates Silica gel PF254 E. Merck,Darmstadt and developed in a solvent system of chloroform methanol water acetic acid 75 25 5 5 . The band of adriamycin at Rf 0.2 was satisfactorily separated from unchanged daunomycin substrate at Rf 0.33 and from dihydrodaunomycin a metabolite of daunomycin at Rf 0.25. The area of adriamycin was scraped off from the thin layer plates. Adriamycin was extracted from the silica gel with a mixture of chloroform and methanol 4 1 v v and then concentrated to dryness in vacuo.For purification, the red residue was dissolved in 50 ml of 0.1 U acetate pH 3.0 and washed twice with 20 ml each of toluene. After adjusting to pH 6.8 with 4 NNaOH under cooling in ice water, the aqueous layer was subjected to extraction with 200 ml in total of chloro form. The chloroform extract was washed with water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and then concentrated to about 3 ml under reduced pressure. Adriamycin in the concentrate was forced to precipitate by addition of 20 ml of n hexane and was recovered by filtration. Drying in vacuo gave l2.6 mg of red powder of adriamycin. The yield of conversion was calculated to be 25 70. EXAMPLE 2 According to the same method as explained in Exam ple 1, mycelia of Streptomyces peucetius subsp. caesius 2N 267 were prepared from 5 liters of culture broth. Following rinsing with 1 liter of 0.1 M Tris HCl buffer, pH 8.5, the mycelia were suspended in 5 liters of the same buffer containing 0.1 mg ml final concentration of Lytic Enzyme num 2 Kyowa Hakkko Co., Ltd. and were allowed to stand at 37 C for one hour. After enzyme treatment, the mycelia were recovered by centrifugation at 40C and lashed with 1 liter of 5 mbi magnesium chloride.The processed mycelia were resuspended in 5 liters of 0.1 M Tris HCl, pH 8.5, containing 5 mM magnesium chloride and then were mixed with 50 ml of 1 mg ml of daunomycin hydrochloride. Fifty milliliters each of the suspension was distributed in 500 ml Erlenmeyer flasks and was kept shaken for 20 hours on a rotary shaker see above . The processed mycelia and the supernatant solution were separated by centrifugation. The supernatant was subjected to extraction with 1.5 liters of chloroform.The processed mic21ia were treated twice with 2 liters each of acetone. The acetone extracts were united and concentrated to a small volume under reduced pressure.Adriamycin was extracted from the acetone concentrate with 1.5 liters of chloroform. The chloroform extracts derived from the supernatant and the mycelia were combined and concentrated to dryness to provide a crude mixture of products. Using the same thin layer chromatographic method as described in Example 1, adriamycin was purified. Final purification consisting of dissolv ing in acidic water followed by back extraction into an organic solvent at neutral pH gave 19.2 mg of pure adriamycin. The percentage of conversion was found to be 38.4 w. EXANIPLE 3 By the same procedures as explained in Examples 1 and 2, the suspensions of the intact mycelia and theLytic Enzyme num 2 treated mycelia of Streptomyces peucetius subsp. caesius 2N 267 were prepared from 5 liters each of the culture broth. After 50 leach of 1 mg ml of dihydrodaunomycin hydrochloride in water was mixed well with the mycelium suspensions, the reaction mixtures were distributed in 50 ml portions into 500 ml Erlenmeyer flasks and were shaken for 20 hours on a rotary shaker. The same isolation and purification method as detailed in Example 1 provided adriamycin. The yield of adriamycin with the en3yme nontreated mycelia was 11.9 mg conversion percentage 23.9 , t whereas that with the enzyme treated mycelia was 17.7 mg conversion percentage 35.4 . EXAMPLE 4 The mycelium suspension of Streptomyces peucetius subsp. caesius 2N 267 was produced from 5 liters of culture broth by the same method as shown in Example 1.To the mycelium suspension, 50 ml of 1 mg ml of deoxodaunomycin hydrochloride in water was added and mixed well. The mixture was distributed in 50 ml portions into 500 ml Erlenmeyer flasks and kept stirred for 20 hours on a rotary shaker. The same procedure for isola tion and purification as described in Example 1 yielded 10.8 mg of adriamycin conversion percentage 21.6 ., EXAMPLE 5 By utilizing the same method as explained in Example 1, 5 liters each of the culture broth of Streptomyces peucetius subsp. caesius 2N 267 gave the mycelium suspensions. After 50 ml of 1 mg ml of carminomycin hydrochloride or dihydrocarminomycin hydrochloride was added and stirred well, 50 ml each of the suspension was distributed in 500 ml Erlenmeyer flasks and then shaken for 20 hours on a rotary shaker. Adriamycin was extracted and purified by the same process as explained in Example 1. The yield of adriamycin was 14.6 mg from carminomycin conversion percentage 29.2 ,Oj and 12.8 mg from dihydrocarminomycin conversion percentage 25.6 . EXAMPLE 6 The seed cultures of Streptomyces peucetius subsp.caesius ATCC 27952 and Streptomyces peucetius subsp.carneus ATCC 2154 were prepared by the same method as described in Example 1. One milliliter each of the seed cultures was inoculated to 500 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 ml of the fermentation medium specified in Example 1, and was cultivated at 28 C for 90 hours on a rotary shaker see above . The mycelia of the two streptomycetes were collected from one flask each of the culture broths by centrifugation and washed with 50 ml of 0.1 M Tris HCl buffer. The mycelia were suspended in 50 ml of the same buffer containing 5 mM magnesium chloride and poured in a 500 ml Erlenmeyer flask.One milliliter of 0.5 mg ml of daunomyci chloride was added to each flask final concentration 10 ,ug ml and the flasks were kept stirred at 28 0C for 20 hours on a rotary shaker see above . Five milliliter each of the suspensions was collected from the flasks and was mixed with 2 ml of methanol and then with 3 ml of chloroform on a mixer. The chloroform layer containing anthracycline compounds was separated and concentrated to dryness in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in 3 ml of 0.1 N HCl and hydrolyzed at 85 0C for 30 minutes, giving adriamycinone, daunomycinone and dihydrodaunomycinone correspond ing to adriamycin, daunomycin and dihydrodaunomycin, respectively.These aglycones were separated from the hydrolysate by extracting twice with 3 ml each of chloroform and the chloroform extracts were combined and concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in 0.1 ml of chloroform. Ten microliters of the solution was spotted on a silica gel thin layer plate silica gel 60 F254, E. erck, Darmstadt and developed in a solvent mixture of benzene, acetone and formic acid 100 30 1 . The Rf values of adriamycinone, daunomycinone and dihydrodaunomycinone were found to be 0.20, 0.35 and 0.16, respectively. The amount of adriamycinone in the corresponding spot was measured at 90 nm in a Shimazu thin layer chromatoscanner CS 910 and was calibrated from the standard curve of authentic adriamycinone.The concentration of adriamycin in reaction mixtures was calculated on the basis of the amount of adriamycinone. The results of thin layer chromatographic analysis are summarized in the following table. For comparison, the same conversion experiment was conducted with the above described mutant 2N 267.EMI26.1 tb SEP Amount SEP of SEP Amount SEP of tb SEP Strains SEP daunomycin SEP SEP adriamycin tb added SEP produced tb g ml tb SEP I SEP SEP 1gftfll SEP tb Streptomyces SEP peucetius SEP None SEP 0.1 tb subsp.
