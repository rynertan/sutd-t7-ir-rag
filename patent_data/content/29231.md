# Reference voltage generator circuit.

## Abstract
A reference voltage generator circuit which can oper ate stably irrespective of variations in a power supply volt age and in threshold voltage of transistors employed is dis closed. The reference voltage generator circuit comprises means for dividing a power supply voltage to produce at least one internal voltage, first means responsive to an in ternal voltage from the dividing means for producing a first output signal having such a response characteristic that the first output signal is increased in value in response to voltage difference between the internal voltage applied thereto and the threshold voltage, second means respon sive to an internal voltage from the dividing means for pro ducing a second output signal having such a response characteristic that the second output signal is decreased in value in response to voltage difference between the inter nal voltage applied thereto and the threshold voltage and means averaging the first and the second output signal thereby to generate a constant value of reference voltage.
