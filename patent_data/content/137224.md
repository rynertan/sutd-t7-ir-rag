# Solid catalyst component for olefin polymerization.

## Abstract
A solid catalyst component for olefin polymerization which is produced by reacting A a silicon compound with B a compound of transition metal of Groups IVa, Va and VIa of the periodic table to obtain a reaction mixture I , reacting the reaction mixture I with C an organomagnesium compound selected from organomagnesium compounds or hydrocarbon soluble complexes between an organomagne sium compound and an organometal compound capable of allowing said organomagnesium compound to be soluble in hydrocarbons to obtain an intermediate product II , and contacting the intermediate product II with D an organo aluminum halide compound represented by the general formula R 1 cAIX
