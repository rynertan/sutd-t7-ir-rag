# Process for the preparation of esters of arylpropionic acids optically active.

## Abstract
There is described a process for the preparation of methyl esters of arylpropionic acids, through carbonylation of the corresponding vinylaromatic compound of formula I R CH CHâ‚‚ I wherein R stands for an aryl group, preferably a phenyl group, a diphenyl, a naphthyl group, also substituted with inert groups, which is made to react with carbon monoxide and methyl alcohol in the presence of a palladium catalyst chosen from amongst complexes of formula II PdL The products thereby obtained consist of esters of arylpropionic acids which, whether as such or in the form of the corresponding acids obtainable from them, find their use as intermediates in the synthesis of organical compounds, in general, with particular purpose for pharmaceutical products thanks to the high regioselectivity associated with a consid erable enantioselectivity, and for which the aspect of the optical selectivity is of the highest therapeutical and econo mical interest.
