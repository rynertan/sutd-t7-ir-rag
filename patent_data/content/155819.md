## Description
This invention relates to pesticides and in particular to pesticidal compounds, the preparation of such compounds, intermediates for use in their preparation, compositions containing such compounds and the use of such compounds and compositions to control pests, for example pests present in soil. Accordingly the present invention comprises a compound of the formula I in which formula Although the acid residue RCOO may derive from a wide variety of cyclopropane carboxylic acids as hereinafter described, it is preferred that the acid residue is of chrysanthemic acid or a 2,2 dimethyl 3 dihalovinyl cyclopropane carboxylic acid, 2,2 dimethyl 3 dibromovinyl cyclopropane carboxylic acid, especially when in the IR When the group R Esters I may be prepared by reaction of a cyclopropane carboxylic acid RC0₂H or an esterifiable thereof with an intermediate of formula II in which formula Y represents a hydroxyl group, an esterifiable derivative thereof or halogen e.g. bromine. Intermediates of formula II are also included in a further aspect of the present invention. It is particularly preferable that when Y represents halogen the intermediate II is reacted with a metal salt, particularly a silver or alkali metal salt of the acid RC0₂H. Intermediates II in which Y represents a hydroxyl group or an esterifiable derivative thereof may be produced from compounds IIA by reaction thereof with an acid salt of the compound R Intermediates II in which Y represents halogen may be produced from compounds IIB, by treatment thereof with a halogenating agent such as a N halosuccinimide e.g. N bromosuccimide. Compounds IIA which Y represents halogen may also be produced by treatment of the ketone IIC. with a halogenating agent such as N bromosuccinimide following which if the corresponding alcohol is required IIA, Y OH the bromine may be replaced by an acetyl group, conveniently by reaction of IIA Y Br with silver acetate and the acetyl derivative hydrolysed. In an alternative procedure for the production of esters I, the acid RCO₂H or an esterifiable derivative thereof is reacted with compound IIA in which Y represents a hydroxyl group, an esterifiable derivative thereof or halogen and the free carbonyl group in the ester thus produced is converted into the corresponding alkyl oxime usually by reaction with an acid salt of R In the compounds of formula I, RCOO represents the residue of a cyclopropane carboxylic acid RCO₂H which is an acid known to be capable of forming pesticidal compounds when esterified with α cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl alcohol. There is a large number of cyclopropane carboxylic acids that are known to form pesticidal compounds of this type. In such acids R in the residue RCOO generally has the formula III In formula III R³ and R⁴ will normally be an alkyl group, usually the same alkyl group, containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms and, as is well known in the art, dimethyl substitution normally gives high activity. R² in formula III will normally be hydrogen or an alkyl group containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms and here the experience of the art indicates that R² will usually be hydrogen for maximum activity except in those compounds where R¹ is also an alkyl group, in which case R² preferably is an alkyl group, R¹, R², R³ and R⁴ all conveniently being the same alkyl group, e.g. methyl. In formula III R¹ can be hydrogen or a substituted or unsubstituted acyclic or carbocyclic group. When R¹ is an unsubstituted hydrocarbyl group, it can be a straight chain or branched saturated or unsaturated acyclic or carbocyclic group such as an alkyl group, an alkenyl or alkadienyl group or a cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl or cycloalkylalkenyl group. These hydrocarbyl groups preferably contain up to 10, particularly up to 6 carbon atoms. When group R¹ is substituted, it is preferably one of the hydrocarbyl groups mentioned above which is substituted by one or more halogeno groups which may be fluorine, chlorine or bromine or by an alkoxy or oximino group or alkoxycarbonyl group, as in a group R¹ of particular interest of formula CH CHCO₂R One particularly valuable structure for the group R¹ is of formula IV where R⁷ and R⁸, which may be the same or different, are each an alkyl group containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a trifluoromethyl group or a halogeno group, which may be the same or different and are preferably fluorine, chlorine or bromine. One of R⁷ and R⁸ may also represent hydrogen or a phenyl or substituted phenyl group. Alternatively, R⁷ and R⁸ may together form a straight or branched substituted or unsubstituted saturated or unsaturated divalent hydrocarbon chain which may be substituted by one or more hetero atoms e.g. 0, N or S, so that R⁷ and R⁸ together with the carbon atom to which they are attached form a carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring which will preferably contain 5 to 7 ring atoms, optionally 1 or 2 carbon to carbon double bonds and optionally one or more alkyl C₁ C₄ or halogeno substituents on the cycloaliphatic ring. Other compounds of interest are those in which R is a group of the structure where the dotted line represents an optional double bond and X₁ represents H or halogen such as chlorine. Specific cyclopropane carboxylic acids from which the compounds I of the present invention may be structurally derived include the following The compounds of the invention exhibit optical isomerism in that the carbon atom bearing the substituent D can exist in the R or S configuration and the present invention includes compounds in which the configuration is substantially completely R or in which the configuration is substantially completely S or mixtures thereof. Compounds of the invention in which R represents a substituted cyclopropane residue of formula III can exist in the form of both geometrical and optical isomers. This is because of the unsymmetrical substitution at C₁ and C₃ of the cyclopropane ring. Compounds of the present invention include those isomers in which the hydrogen atoms at C₁ and C₃ of the cyclopropane ring are substantially completely in the When R is a group of formula III in which R¹ is a group of formula IV in which the substitution about the ethylenic bond is asymmetrical, that is to say R⁷ R⁸ then the configuration of this part of the molecule can be substantially completely in the E form or substantially completely in the Z form or a mixture thereof. The compounds of the present invention can be in the form of single isomers but, having regard to the fact that the compounds have at least one and frequently more than one centre of asymmetry, the compounds of the invention will normally be in the form of isomer mixtures although these isomer mixtures can be optically active and or substantially completely in one geometric form. When, as hereinbefore described, the compounds of the present invention are prepared by an esterification involving the reaction of an alcohol of formula II or an esterifiable derivative thereof with a carboxylic acid of formula RCOOH or an esterifiable derivative thereof, it is usually convenient in practice to react an alcohol of formula II with an acyl chloride of formula RCOCl or to esterify the carboxylic acid with the alcohol in the presence of dicyclohexyl carbodi imide and a catalyst. Alternatively, the esters of the invention can be prepared by transesterification by reacting a C₁ C₆ alkyl ester of the carboxylic acid with an alcohol of formula II in the presence of a basic transesterification catalyst. This method is not usually satisfactory where the molecule contains another base sensitive residue, e.g. where the carboxylic acid is pyrethric acid. One or more of the pesticidal esters of formula I can be formulated with an inert carrier or diluent to give pesticidal compositions and such compositions form a further aspect of the present invention. These compositions can be in the form of dusts and granular solids, wettable powders, mosquito coils and other solid preparations, or as emulsions, emulsifiable concentrates, sprays and aerosols and other liquid preparations after the addition of the appropriate solvents, diluents and surface active agents. Compositions formulated in a manner suitable for controlling soil pests typically by treatment of the soil are of especial interest. For this purpose compositions containing compounds I hereinbefore described are particularly suitable as they generally have lower molecular weights than many previously described pyrethroids, and it is envisaged that their relatively high vapour pressures allow them to diffuse through the soil. The pesticidal compositions of the invention will normally contain from 0.001 to 25 by weight of the compound of formula I but the compositions can contain higher concentrations of active ingredient of formula I e.g. up to 95 for compositions to be sold as concentrates for dilution before use by the ultimate user. The compositions of the invention can include diluents such as hydrocarbon oils, e.g. xylene or other petroleum fractions, water, anionic, cationic or non ionic surface active agents, anti oxidants and other stabilisers as well as perfumes and colouring matters. These inert ingredients may be of the type and in proportions such as are conventionally used in pesticidal compositions containing pyrethroid like compounds. In addition to these inactive ingredients, the compositions of the present invention may contain one or more further active ingredients which may be other pesticidal compounds of the pyrethroid type or of other types and the composition may also include synergists of the type known to be capable of synergising the activity of natural pyrethrin and pyrethroid like insecticides. Synergists of this type include piperonyl butoxide, tropital and sesamex. The compounds of formula I can be used to control pest infestation in the domestic, horticultural or agricultural or medical, including veterinary, areas. The compounds or compositions of the invention can be used to combat pest infestation by treating pests or surfaces or environments susceptible to pest infestation with effective amounts of the active compounds of formula I or of compositions containing them. For example, they may be used in a domestic environment for spraying rooms to combat infestation with houseflies or other insects, they can be used for treatment of stored dry crops or cereals to combat infestation by insects or other pests, they can be used to spray growing crops, e.g. cotton or rice to combat infestation by common pests and they can be used in a medical or veterinary field, e.g. as a cattle spray to prevent or treat infestation by insects or other pests. Although, as hereinbefore indicated, they are of particular interest for the disinfestation of soil to control pests such as the onionfly, Delia antiqua, the compounds may find application in the control of a wide variety of pests including The invention is illustrated by the following Examples.

The pesticidal activity is assessed against houseflies and mustard beetles by using the following techniques Female flies are treated on the thorax with one microlitre drop of insecticide dissolved in acetone. Two replicates of 15 flies are used at each dose rate and 6 dose rates are used per compound under test. After treatment, the flies are maintained at a temperature of 20 Acetone solutions of the test compound are applied ventrally to adult mustard beetles using a micro drop applicator. The treated insects are maintained for 48 hours after which time kill is assessed. Two replicates of 40 to 50 mustard beetles are used at each dose level and 5 dose levels are used for each compound. Again, LD₅₀ values are calculated and relative potencies are calculated from the inverse ratios of LD₅₀ see Elliott Relative potencies are calculated by comparison with 5 benzyl 3 furylmethyl IR
