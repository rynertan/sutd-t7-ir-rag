## Description
DC Voltage Supply. This invention is concerned with DC voltage suppl and more particularly with DC voltage supplies of the multiplier type by means of which extremely hibTh. DC volt ages may be obtained starting from an AC voltage of low or mid range value. One field of use for the invention is the simultane ous supply of different high DC potentials along the sui faces of opposed electrodes of an ionographic imaging chamber to create an electrostatic field having an equipotential plane configuration which is not parallel with the surface of the opposed electrodes. Examples of iono graphic imaging chambers having electrodes with varying surface potential for electrostatic field correction purposes are disclosed, e.g. in United States Patent Specifi cation no. 3,859,529 of Andrew P.Proudian, Teodoro Azzarel li and Murray Samuel Welkowsky issued January 7, 1975. In order to obtain a plurality of DC potentials several methods are available. The most common method consists in rectifying higil AC voltages, applying the rectified aC voltage to a poten tiometer circuit, if necessary after a preliminary filtor ing by means of high voltage capacitors, and deriving the required voltages from appropriate points in the potentlo meter circuit. The potentiometer itself, being resistive in nature, consumes a considerable amount of energy in the form of heat. Moreover, due partly to the necessary break down characteristics of the insulation of the transformer or of the rectifying device itself, apparatus for producing DC potentials in that way, are expensive and or voluminous.The structure of the transformer, especially the insulation of the secondary winding may become less critical when making use of a so called Greinacher circuit by means of which the rectified DC voltage may be doubled, but it is still necessary to utilise a potentiometric technique to produce a plurality of high DCvoltages. Other prior art devices by which a series of high DC voltages can be generated rely upon a so called cascade circuit by means of which an AC voltage of moderate magnitude is rectified and multiplied by means of a number of rectifying units comprising two rows of seriesconnected capacitors and interconnected diodes. High DO voltages can be generated by providing a sufficient number of capacitors and diodes. The major advantages of such a circuit are that no special problems arise with respect to the transformer design and that as the cap a citors are series coupled they constitute a kind of static potentiometer which theoretically does not itself con sume a part of the rectified power. Row ever such a cascade rectified multipler incorporating a long chain of rectifying units has the disadvantage that an uncontrollable voltage drop occurs along the chain. his is mainly due to the rather high internal resistance of the chain and of its constituent elements. Another disadvantage of such a cascade rectifier multiplier is the fact that even and odd multiples of the basic rectified voltage are delivered by different rows of capacitors. One row of capacitors provided by the series coupled units delivers the even multiples of the basic rectified voltage, whereas the other row delivers the odd multiples thereof. When an arbitrary number of odd and even multiples of the basic voltage is required si nultaneously, one sole cascade rectifier multiplier chain does not suffice. The present invention provides an An to DC voltage converter circuit which avoids these disadvantages. According to the invention, there is provided a Dv voltage supply by means of which an AC voltage delivered by an AC source is converted into a DC voltage, coepriC,nng first and second rectifiers each having at least a cathode and an anode, and first and second capacitors each having first and second electrodes, said al3para z being characterised in that the cathode of said fist rectifier is connected to the first electrode of said first capacitor and the anode of said first rectifier is connected to the second electrode of said second capacitor, and analogous, ly, the cathode of said second rectifier is connected to the first electrode of said second capacitor and the anode of said second rectifier is connected to the second electrode of said first capacitor, and in that there is a pair of input terminals which are respectively connected to different corresponding electrodes of said first and second rectifiers, and a pair of output terminals which are r pectively connected to one and the other of the other co responding electrodes df such rectifiers. It will be clear that, depending on the electrode connections of the rectifying elements a DC voltage of positive or negative polarity will be obtained. When the cathodes are connected to the input terminals, a DC voltage of negative polarity will be obtained as output, whereas, when the anodes are connected to the input terminals, the DC voltage obtained as output will have a positive po larity. Preferably the time constant of the rectifying apparatus is such that a substantially continuous DC voltage is obtained as output. Most preferably, therefor, the ACinput voltage will have a frequency, the period of which is small when compared with the time constant. In carrying out the invention, use can be made of vacuum tube rectifiers or solid state rectifiers. In certain embodiments solid state rectifiers with very short switching times are used. Such rectifiers are particularly preferred when a relatively high frequency AC power source is to be employed. The rectifiers used may be uncontrolled rectifiers, such as diodes, or they may have supplementary control electrodes as is the case for thyristors, etc. Any number of units, each comprising rectifying apparatus according to the invention, can be connected in series to obtain a required DC voltage output which is a multiple of the DC output of one of the units. The coupling is effected by connecting the output terminals of one unit with the input terminals of the following unit. By series coupling a sufficient number of the units very high DC voltages can be derived such as may be required for operating an ionographic imaging chamber as hereinbefore referred to. High DC voltage outputs of positive and negative polarities can be obtained. The invention includes a voltage multiplier rectifier comprising a plurality of series connected rectifying apparatus according to the invention as hereinbefore defined. Preferably individual rectifying apparatus according to the invention are manufactured as unitary components having facility for easy coupling of any number of such components in series to form a voltage multiplier rectifier and having terminals via which a DC voltage can be tapped from a said multiplier. The DC voltage generated by a rectifying apparatus according to the invention will have the form of a half wave which has undergone a smoothening effect, depending on the rating of the capacitors. In preferred embodiments a voltage multiplier rectifier according to the invention is connected to a source of relatively high frequency alternating current having e.g. a frequency of 10 50 kc s of square wave for a. P such cases the individual rectifying apparatus preferably incorporate solid state rectifiers with very short swit ching times as previously referred to. The AC source preferably comprises a power oscillator whose output power and frequency can be easily controlled. In That way the multiplier can be made very flexible.It has been found that especially when using a very long char series of basic rectifying units according to the invention, the voltage drop which inevitably occurs a o the chain may be compensatea by means of separate windings on the transformer coil forming part of the oscillato which may be connected to any desired points of the chain.In this way a kind of boosting or regeneration of theDC voltage may be realised. Thus, the invention also includes a generator for generating a high DC voltage which generator comprises a source,of AC voltage, a transformer having a primary winding connected to said AC voltage source and having a number of secondary windings, and a voltage multiplier rectifier comprising a plurality of series connected rectifying apparatus according to the invention as hereinbefore defined, and wherein one of said secondary transfor mer windings is connected to the input terminals of the first of said series of rectifying apparatus and the o each other on said secondary windings is connected to he input terminals of another of the rectifying apparat in said series. Certain embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accom panying diagrammatic drawings, in which Fig. 1 illustrates In a diagrammatic way an ionogra phy chamber and the voltages at which it is operated, Fig. 2 is the electronic scheme of a rectifier unit according to te invention aud Fig. 3 is a block diagram of a high DC voltage supply.in whirl a plurality of rectifying units of fig. 2 are used. Fig. 4 illustrates tbe effect of regenerating the A vvltage along a chain of rectifying elements of Fig.3. Accordingto the illustration of Fig. 1, an lonography imaging chamber 5, represented in cross sectional view, comprIses electrodes 6 and 7 onto one of which a dielectric receptor 8 is provided. Within the space defined byelec trodos Caid 17 7 is provided a radiation responsive medium, preferably a high atomic number gas, which converts part of the incoming radiation indicated in dotted lines into a charge pattern formed by charge carriers of a given polarity.Under the influence of a suitable electric field, created by DC source 10n, formed by a plurality of rectifier units 10 according to the invention see fig.2 the charge carriers migrate towards an electrode and are intercepted by the dielectric receptor 8 and may be rendered visible by Zmown electrographic developing techniques after withdrawal of the dielectric preceptor 8 from the imaging chamber 5. It will be clear to the skilled worker that, when only the field between the electrodes 6 and 7 created by the DC source 10n, is present, problems related to image sharpness may arise.Indeed, due to the oblique incidence of the radiation and the perpendicular orientation of the yield lines, the charges which are created according to an oblique line a will deposit on the dielectric receptor 8 according to line b, depending on the distance between the electrodes 6 and 7 at which they are formed. As it has been observed that the unsharpness of the image obtained after processing may rise to a considerable degree, especially at the areas located in the vici nity of the periphery of the dielectric carrier 8, field correcting expedients have to be provided. These field correcting expedients will provide for an alternative orientation of the electric field lines in the space defined by electrodes 6 and 7 in such a way that the lines are deviated from their parallel orientation and will point towards the source of radiation not represented so that they coincide with the orientation of the emitted radiation. A convenient way to provide for the necessary field correction may be obtained by the addition of a supplementary electric field to the field existing between eCc trodes 6 and 7. The configuration of said field on each electrode must be such that it conforms to a spherica cap, the centre of the sphere being the source of radiation. The final field existing at the electrodes 6 and 7 of the ionography imaging chamber 5 will thus conform to concentric spherical caps whereby the difference between the fieldsbetween both electrodes will be equal to the initial field, generated by the DC source 10. It will be clear to those skilled in the art that geometrically correct spherical fields can only be built up very difficultly and that for convenience sake recurrence will be made to approximations. To this end, electrodes 6 and 7 are provided with a plurality of supplementary concentric ring electrodes 9, respectively 9 , to which suitable electric DC potentials delivered by DC sources 10a...10C and 10 a...10 c are applied. Each of the DC sources 10a...10cX 10 a...10 C will also be formed by a plurality of rectifier units 10 according to the invention see fig. 2 . The concentric ring electrodes 9 and 9 may be formed by selective etching techniques or may be even embedded in the electrodes 6 and 7 during the manufacture of the latter as illustrated . The relation existing between the DC potentials of the sources 10a 10a , 10 a101 , 10 a 10 c and 10n may be expressed as follows E10 E10 E10 a a n 10b ElOb E10n F E10 E10c E10c E10n and E10 ,E10b E10b E10a C b a E10c E10b E10a The relationship existing between E10a , E10b, E10c a b C and E10a , E10b, E,10c , ...is such that both systems con form to the equation of concentric circles and moreover to concentric spheres when the electrodes 9 have a circular shape as assumed here . The sources 10a.. 10c 10a,.. 10c, may be formed by various techniques. It will be clear that providing said sources in the form of material batteries is quite impractical, due to the very high voltages E10 in the order of n 15 kVolts which are involved. Therefore, recurrence may be made to potentiometric techniques of conventional design but they are impractical too, as the potentiometer from which the voltages are derived would consume the major part of the energy, due to the relatively high specific resistance of the electrodes 6 and 7 themselves from 108 to 1011 Ohm cm . According to the invention now, the DC voltages represented by the source symbols 10 In 10b, 10c ..., 10a,, 10b 10c .. and 10n may be obtained by means of a static potentiometer which is composed of a plurality of identical rectifying units 10, each unit generating a given, constant DC voltage. In order to create over the electrodes 6, 7 electric fields which conform to a spherical shape, the number of cells between two taps 21 will be chosen in such a way that the series of voltages which are each time formed, will behave as satisfying the equation of concentric circles. The basic design of a rectifier unit 10 is illustrated in fig. 2. As may be seen, said rectifier unit comprises two rectifiers 11 and 12 and two capacitors 13 and 14. The capacitors 13 and 14 are loaded by the rect fiers 11 and 12 when the alternating voltage VAC appea lg at the terminals acting as input terminals makes the tifiers conducting. So capacitor 13 is loaded by dio 2 during that part of the AC cycle the anode of diode 12 has a positive polarity During the next part of the cycles it is the capacitor 14 which is loaded by diode 11. After one complete cycle of the AC voltage, both capacitors 13 and 14 are loaded to approximately the peak value of theAC voltage. The loads not shown are connected between the output terminals 21 and the ground.In case a plurality of.units 10 are connected in series the output terminals of the first one will act as input terminals for the second one, etc. The diodes 11 and 12 may be semiconductor devices as illustrated here, but it will be appreciated that every type of rectifier may be used conveniently, even rectifying elements provided with supple mentary control electrodes such as thyristors, etc. The rectifier unit 10 may be mounted in a casing 15 for more convenience ad safety, whereinafter the residual spacemay be filled with a highly insulating substance. The AC voltage, applied to the rectifier unit, may cover a rather broad frequency range, in the range of 50 c s 75 kc s for example, and preferably between 10 and 50 kc s, so that a practically optimum charging of the capacitors 13 and 14 may be realized. It will be clear that for AC voltages of relatively high frequency diodes 11 az 12 must be of the rapid switching time type. A type that is used conveniently is the high voltage diode type BB10 of International Rectifier Cy. By series coupling of a plurality of rectifier units 10, the voltage at conse outlive capacitors are added to each other, so that very high DC voltages are generated.In the mean time, the Ca pacitors 13, 14 provide for a smoothening effect of the rectified DC voltage. Fig. 3 illustrates how a plurality of rectifier units 10 may be coupled in series in order to obtain a DC voltage having a magnitude equal to the product of the basicDC voltage of each unit and to the number of units 10. In case one desires to dispose of as well positive as nega tive DC voltages, a point along the series, such as pointE, may be chosen as the zero reference point. It will be clear that when the diodes 11 and 12 in the rectifier units 10 are coupled as it is illustrated in the unit of fig. 2, the DC voltage obtained at the outputs 21, lying above the reference point E will be positive, whereas the DG voltage at the outputs 21 lying under the reference point will be negative. In case the diodes 11 and 12 are reversed, so that the direction of the durrent start flowing in opposite direction, the reverse situation is obtained. As also illustrated in fig.3 the AC voltage to be converted is delivered by a high frequency power oscillator 30 formed by transistors 31 and 32 which convert the DCpower applied to terminals 33 and 34 into a square wave pattern which appears at the primary winding 35 of transformer 36. Via the secondary windings 37 and 38 of the transformer 36, the AC voltages are applied to the series circuit of rectifier units 10. The output of the secon dary windings 37 and 38 may be regulated in frequency as well as in magnitude. This is obtained by means of control circuits.One of said circuits which particularly provides the stabilization of the frequency is composed of an auxiliary transformer 39, which winding 40 is directly coupled with the primary winding 35 of transformer 36 and which secondary winding 41 is coupled with the base of power transistors 31 and 32. Supplementary regulations and controls are carried out by means of a sensing circuit which comprises a controlledDC power amplifier A, one input of which is connected to the output of a regulator sensing amplitude variations at an arbitrarily chosen point in the rives of rectifier units 10 via the lead 42. The reference DC signal is obtained by means of a potentiometer formed by DC source 43 and variable resistor 44. The output of the regulator is applied at the input of DC power amplifier A, so that the voltage between terminals 33, 34 is stabilized, and amplitude variations in the output of the oscillator 30are excluded. As may also be derived from fig. 3, the series of rectifier units 10 are connected at a given point with secondary winding 38 of transformer 36 which delivers the same AC voltage as secondary winding 37. This is done in order to compensate for the unevitable voltage drop along the series of rectifier units 10 and which is due to the ohmic losses occurring along the line. These voltage drops may be compensated by means of a refreshing technique which consists in applying the same AC signal at an arbitrarily chosen point where otherwise the DC voltage would already have been decreased substantially. In case extremely long series of rectifier units 10 are realized, such refreshing technique may be applied as many times as necessary. Finally, the graph in fig. 4 illustrates how the mechanism of the refreshing technique is working. In the graph, the abscissa denotes the number n of rectifying units 10 placed in series. On the ordinate, the magnitude of the DC voltage is plotted out which each of them produces In function of the distance in relation to the point where the AC voltage is applied. It will be clear that a constant value of such DC voltage is desired, such as repr sented by the linear curve 50. In practice, however, this requirement is not fulfilled and the relationship which may be realized may be represented by the curve 51, so that after a given number of rectifier units a voltage drop amounting to A E occurs.In order to compensate for this inconvenience, a voltage varying according to the curve 52 will be built up, so that the resultant voltage distribution may be represented by the curve 53. It may be derived that the relationship obtained after refreshing is nct purely linear but the straight line approximation is realized in a sufficient way. A preferred embodiment of the apparatus which has been successfully used for generating the required voltages in anionography imaging chamber as aforedescribed, showed the following characteristics switching power transistors type 2N 5686 of MOTOROLA Cy operating frequency between 10 and 50 kc s DC voltage produced by each rectifying cell 465 Volts DC power available 40 to 50 Watts AC power delivered by the oscillator 100 Watts yield of the oscillator 70 number of rectifier units 96 number of refreshing stages 4 evenly distributed along the line . It will be clear that the high DC voltage supply according to the invention may be provided with supplementary expedients in order to increase its ergonomic or safety characteristics. So may be provided resistors 22 see fig. 3 only a few of which being shown in order to increase the internal resistance of the rectifying cells.In this way not only a substantial voltage drop at output terminals 23 may be realized when inadvertently touching the latter, but at the same time the rectifiers 11 and 12 see fig. 2 may be adequately protected in the case an abnormal current for example in the case of short circuiting between terminals 23 would occur. This would be the case when e.g. during the manufacturing stage of electrodes 6 or 7, the ring electrodes 9 embedded therein would be insufficiently insulated from each other so that a path of minor resistance is created, giving rise finally to a breakdown between such electrodes 9. The DC voltage rectifier multiplier circuit according to the invention is compact and very reliable. Voltage stabilization is obtained by the refreshing technique.As a consequence of the complete absence of heat generation during operation, the whole circuit may be embedded in an epoxy resin casing.
