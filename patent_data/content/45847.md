# Automatic speed control systems.

## Abstract
Linkage is disclosed for adjusting the position of a diesel engine injection pump control rack 60 in dependence on the position of the driver s accelerator pedal and also on a system for automatically maintaining the vehicle speed at a desired value. The injection pump rack 60 is positioned by means of a pneumatic piston cylinder assembly 62 and linkage 64. The pressure in the assembly 62 is adjusted by means of a valve 70 in a supply line from a pressure source 66, and valve 70 is adjusted by the driver s accelerator pedal. A normally open valve 74 is also connected in the pressure circuit and a normally closed exhaust valve 76 is provided. When the automatic speed control system is in operation, the driver fully opens valve 70 by fully depressing the foot pedal 72 and the automatic system adjusts valves 74 and 76 to hold the speed at the desired value. When the driver releases the foot pedal 72, valve 70 shuts, preventing the automatic speed control having any further effect on engine power.
