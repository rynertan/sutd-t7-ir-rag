## Description
Process For Producing Human MonoclonalThis invention concerns human monoclonal antibodies. A novel method for their production involving immortalization of human antibody secreting cells prior to fusion and conversion to hybridoma cells is disclosed. Human monoclonal antibodies recognizing human cell surface antigens and viruses associated with the herpes group are disclosed. Summarv The present invention is concerned with a method for producing human monoclonal antibodies from human Blymphocytes which comprises the following 1. immunization of human B lymphocytes HBL in tissue culture, 2. transformation of HBL by a viral agent, preferrably Epstein Barr virus to generate immortalized cells 3. selection of cells secreting specific antibodies and cloning of these cells and 4. fusion of the cloned cells with suitable human or mouse myeloma cells to generate high secreting hybridomas, and cloning of these hybridomas.The method may be used, for example, to prepare human monoclonal antibodies which recognize HLA, A, B, C or DR antigen by transforming PBL which have been immunized in vitro with the antigen or by transforming PBL from blood of multiparous women with high anti HLA and or DR antibody titers.The method may also be used to produce human monoclonal antibodies recognizing cytomegalo virus antigens by transforming PBL from an individual exposed to cytomegalo virus with a viral agent, preferrably Epstein Barr virus to generate immortalized cells and fusing the transformed cells with a second immortal cell line.Human monoclonal antibodies designated 312 A 91.4 and 311 25 have been produced by this method.BackgroundSuccessful production of murine B lymphocyte hybridomas made it possible to manufacture antibodies with restricted specificities in large quantities. However, attempts to produce human monoclonal antibodies with the methodologies established for the murine antibodies have failed.Human monoclonal antibodies to human cell surface antigens, especially the major histocompatibility complex MHC have been sought. A number of mouse monoclonal antibodies mAb to HLA, A, B, C surface antigens and toDR antigens have been prepared Brodsky, F. M., Parham,P., Barnstable, C. J., Crumption, M. J., and Bodmer, W.F. Immunol. Rev. 47 3 1979 Trucco, M., Garotta, J. W.,Strocker, J. W., and Cepellini, R. Immunol. Rev. 47 219, 1979 Trucco, M., Stocker, J. W. and Cepellini, R. Nature 273 666, 1978 Quaranta, V., Pellegrino, M. A.and Ferrone S. In Monoclonal antibodies and T cellHybridomas. Eds. G. J. Hammerling, U. Hammerling and J.F. Kearney. Elsevier North Holland, Amsterdam, p. 84, 1981 Lampson, L. A. and Levy, R. J. Immunol. 125 293, 1980 . These antibodies have been showed to react with antigenic sites common to all MHC antigens, but except in isolated instances do not react with polymorphic determinants of the human MHC. General experience in immunogenetics has taught the value of alZoimmunízations and the fine specificities of the resulting alloantibodies. Accordingly, only alloantibodies are regarded as suitable to chart the genetic and serological complexities of the human MHC, and hence ultimately provide the reagents necessary for human tissue typing. It is to be expected that relevant monoclonal antibodies will derive sooner from alloimmune than from heteroimmune lymphocytes.Previous human monoclonal antibodies to human cell surface antigens, notably to MHC antigens are not known.Human monoclonal antibodies associated with viruses of the herpes group have also been sought. The herpes virus group consists of a large number of viruses which are either etiological agents or found associated with numerous human illnesses. They include Herpes type 1 and type 2, Cytomegalovirus, Varicella Zoter, Epstein BarrVirus, among others. Cytomegalovirus CMV is in itself a complex group of viruses, the members of which can cause many diseases in man. Serological classifications of CMV in pertinent serotypes is incomplete at best.Monoclonal antibodies would provide ideal reagents for serotyping. Human monoclonal antibodies would also be important adjuncts for the treatment of CMV infections, as implied from the beneficial use of immune gamma globulin in patients. To date, human monoclonal antibodies with specificity to CMV have not been produced. It is now clear that the biology of human B lymphocytes necessitates a total change of approach from that used in the murine methodology in order to produce human monoclonal antibodies.DescriptionThe present invention will be more fully understood from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawing wherein Figure 1 depicts the virus transformation step of the method.Human monoclonal antibodies obtained by the method disclosed in the present invention bear the designated deposit number and are deposited with Sloan KetteringInstitute, 1275 York Avenue, New York, New York 10021.Preferred cell lines of the present invention are also deposited at the American Type Culture Collection,Bethesda, Maryland and bear the following deposit numbers SK Deposit Number ATCC 312 A 91.4 HB 8317 311 125 CRL 8316Deposit is for the purpose of enabling disclosure only and is not intended to limit the concept of the present invention to the particular materials deposited.The terminology lymphcyte and cell is used interchangeably in this application as is usual in the art.In accordance with the inventive method, a reliable source of immunized human B lymphocyte must be obtained.Preferrably normal peripheral blood lymphocytes constitute that source. Towards this goal a culture method has been developed Hoffman, M. K. Proc. Nat l. Acad. Sci.USA 77, 1139, 1980 Lane, H. C. et al. J. Exp. Med. 154, 1043, 1981 Misiti, J. et al J. Exp. Med. 154, 1069, 1981 Morimoto, C. et al. J. Immunol. 127, 514, 1981 that permits effective immunization of unsensitized human PBM to sheep erythrocytes SRBC or antigens conjugated to SRBC such as trinitrophenyl groups, TNP and immunization of presensitized human lymphocytes to other antigens tetanus toxoid, alloantigens . Specific B lymphocytes obtained in this method can be readily transformed according to the present invention with EB virus and TNP specific as well as other antigen specific transformed B cell lines have thus been obtained. For convenience, the PBL, once obtained, may be cryopreserved prior to immunization.It is possible that antibody secreting human B cells, as terminally differentiated cells, have in their biological life cycle a limited allowance of generation cycles.It is conceivable such a block is a dominant feature which might negatively influence the fusion cell partner. The contention that human plasma cells have a limited potential for proliferation is supported by the low frequency of human plasmacytomas, the general difficulty of adapting such plasmacytomas to cell culture, the reported failure to clone immunoglobulin secreting plasma cell type progeny of EBV transformed B cells Fu,S. M., et al 3. Exp. Med. 148, 1570, 1978 , and the inability to maintain normal human B cells in the PFC in culture. In fact, the situation may not be different in principal from that of mouse plasmacytomas which are infrequent in most mouse strains except the BALB c strain Potter, M. Methods in Cancer Research. Ed. H. Busch. Academic Press. Vol. 2, 1967, p. 105 .Based on this hypothesis the inventive method was devised to circumvent the possibility of a biological block using an adaptation of EBV transformation technique as a means of immortalizing and cloning human alloantibody forming cells to human lymphocyte surface antigens, specifically to HLA A, B, C and DR antigens.Clones of low secreting cells may be then turned into high secreting cells by fusion with standard murine plasmacytoma cells or human myeloma cells.The inventive method for generating human monoclonal antibodies mAb comprises essentially the steps 1 human B lymphocytes are sensitized or immunized using a suitable antigen immunization is prefer rably in vitro but sensitized PBL of high titer to a specific antigen may also be employed 2 the antibody producing cell lines are then immorta lized by EB virus transformation 3 the transformed cells are fused with a second immortal cell lines, a mouse myeloma cell line, for example.The transformed cell lines are then cloned that is, after culturing, one selects those cell colonies which have the desired characteristics and the cloned cell lines are grown to produce the desired antibodies. The method may comprise, in addition, the steps of cloning transformed cells, screening the cloned transformed cells for antibody secretion and selecting for fusion the efficient antibody secretors that is, those which secrete the larger amounts of antibody under the cloning conditions.The following examples are provided to illustrate the method of the present invention and the human monoclonal antibodies that have been obtained thereby. They are in no way, however, intended to limit the scope of the invention.EXAMPLESI. Human mAb to nominal antigens sheeprvthrocvtes SRBC and trlnltrophenyl groups XTNP a Isolation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes PBL This procedure follows standard ficoll hypague density gradient centrifugation. 50 milli liters of human blood are diluted with a twofold volume of Earles balanced salt solution EBSS , layered on lymphoprep Ryegard, Denmark and cen trifuged at room temperature for 30 min. at 1800 RPM. The cells from the interface are isolated, washed in EBSS and counted. b In vitro immunization of PBL with TSP SRBC. 40 x 10 Human PBL suspended 10 milliliters of in Mishell Dutton medium Misheli, R. I. and Dutton, R. W. J. Exp. Med. 126 423 containing 5 g fetal 5 calf serum FBS , antibiotics, 5 x 10 2 mercaptoethanol 2 ME . Thirty microliters of a 50 E suspension of heat killed staphylococcus aureus, strain Cowan I, 300 microliters of B cell differentiation factors BDF Hoffmann, M. K., Proc. Nat l. Acad. Sci. USA 77 1139, 1980 , and 50 microliters of a 6 TNP SRBC suspension are added to this cell suspension, and the mixture is then distributed evenly into one 96 well Costar plate. The cells are cultured for 18 hours in humidi fied CO incubators, and 10 microliters of human 2 AB serum is added to each well. Culturing is con tinued for 4 days with intermittant feeding by 10 microliters of feeding cocktail Mishell, et al. Supra every other day. The cells are then har vested, washed in EBSS and counted. Antibody for mation is assessed by the Jerne plague assay Jerne, N. K. and Nordin, A. A. Science 140 405, 1963 using TNP horse erythrocytes and SRBC.c Isolation of B cells and transformatiofty Epstein Barr virus EBV 6 Immunized PBL are adjusted to 4 x 10 cells per ml in medium containing 5 FBS. 10 milliliters of the mixture is added to petridishes coated with polyvalent affinity purified rabbit anti human Ig antibody. The dishes are prepared by incubating 10 cm microbiological grade plastic dishes with 10 ml of the antibody at 10 micrograms ml overneight in the refrigerator, followed by blocking residual sites by incubation with a 10 solution FBS in o EBSS for 1 hr. at 37 C. B cells are allowed to o attach during 3 hrs. at 4 C. The plates are then washed gently with EBSS twice to remove T cells. 10 ml of a virus solution containing high titers of EBV are added to the plate which is then trans ferred to a CO incubator overnight. The virus 2 suspension used is the culture fluid of the marmo set cell line B95 8 as described Miller, G. and Lipman, M. Proc. Nat l. Acad. Sc. U. S. A. 70 190, 1973 . After overnight culture the B cells are harvested from the petridish, counted and trans ferred to 96 well plates containing a confluent layer of human fibroblasts e. g. Flow 5000 4 cells . 40 x 10 cells are seeded in each well. Cultures are fed twice weekly. The culture medium is RPMI 1640 containing 10 FBS, antibiotics and 2 ME. This EBV transformation scheme is depicted in Figure 1. d Screening enlny of culture Supernates are harvested when the cultures have 5 grown to 1 to 2 x 10 cells per well. The antibody content is measured by hemagglutiuation using TNP SRBC, SRBC alone, and TNP horse RBC. In parallel, ELISA assays are set up with TNP conjugated to bovine serum albumin G. J. Hammerlin, and J. Kearney. Monoclonal antibodies and T cell hybrido mas. Perspectives and technical advances. Appen dix, Elsevier North Holland, 1981, p. 574 . The developing antibody is polyvalent, affinity puri fied anti human IgG coupled with alkaline phos phatase. Antibody positive cultures so identified are propagated further. Part of the cells are frozen for future reference.e Original cultures of EBV transformed cells contain many isolated clusters of cells As cells within each cluster are relatively homogeneous individual clusters are hand picked with the aid of a capil lary pipet and transferred to new 96 well plates containing confluent monolayers of irradiated human fibroblasts. Cells are allowed to grow to 1 5 x 10 well and supernates are again tested for antibody by a suitable method, the method des cribed hereinabove at ld, for example. Antibody positive cultures are again propayated by transfer of individual clusters, or stored in liquid nitro gen for future use. Cloning by growth in soft aaar. This procedure is well known in the art, as for example disclosed by Sugden, B. and Mark, W. J. in Virol. 23 503 1977 . Experimental results are given in Tables 1 and 2.

Five to seven days later the B cells were isolated by passing the cells over plastic dishes coated with affinity purified polyva3ent rabbit anti human IgG, using one 10 cm dish per 4 7 7 x 10 cells. From 1.2 to 2.5 x 10 B cells were recovered as the adherent fraction. They were 90 to 95 8 Ig by immunofluorescence. B cells were infected with 3 ml of undiluted culture fluid of the marmoset cell lineB958. Cells were than diluted with RPMI medium contai 5 ning 10 FBS to 2 x 10 cells ml and seeded on 96 well plates. These contained a confluent layer of human fibroblasts and were irradiated with 4000 rads before use. 4Each well received 2 x 10 B cells. Growth was noticeable after 2 weeks, and after 4 weeks cultures were tested for antibody using three assays 1 addition of TNP SRBC to wells and reading hemaggluti nation patterns, 2 hemagglutination to anti TNP SRBC, TNP horse and SRBC in Terasaki plates, 3 ELISA with TNP BSA as antigen.Twenty three cultures showed antibody activity to SRBC and 47 to TNP see Table 2 . Cells from positive cultures were frozen in liquid nitrogen. Of the 35 cultures carried further, 24 discontinued making antibody some, probably due to overgrowth by irrelevant cells, at a declining rate. To estimate the number of TNP specific cells, antibody rosettes were allowed to form with TNPSRBC. Of 20 cultures so tested, seven produced 10 or more rosettes, five had from 1 to 10 , and the rest were either negative, showed occasional rosettes, or were ambiguous clumps due to dead cells .Attempts to clone anti TNP secreting cells in agarose were in part successful. Ten thousanÅa cells of 6 selected anti TNP cultures were grown in 0.35 agarose, on top of an irradiated fibroblast monolayer overlayed with 0.5 8 agarose, using RPMI medium. Colonies developed in five of the six cultures within 3 weeks.They were picked under the stereomicroscope, transferred 4 5 to irradiated fibroblast feeders and grown to 10 10 cells well. When tested by ELISA, 3 of 5 anti TNP cell lines yielded positive clones with varying frequencies see Table 3 . Culture fluids were assayed by the ELISA procedure of J. Kearney G. J. Hammerling, U. Hammerling, and J. Kearney. Monoclonal antibodies and T cell hybridomas. Perspectives and technical advances. Appendix, Elsevier North Holland, 1981, p. 574 . Immunochemical assays to show homogeneity and monoclonality of human Ig are underway. Assays with class specific and L chain specific mAb by ELISA showed clones 223 38 and 223 97 to be IgG, whereas clone 223 187 was ambiguous and probably still represents a mixture.These results reinforce our opinion that in vitro immunization of nonimmune lymphocytes, rescue of immune cells so generated by EBV transformation, and cloning in soft agar is a viable method for the production of human mAb.Cloning by limiting dilution in microcytotoxicity platesMicrocytotoxicity plates Falcon 3034 were seeded with human fibroblasts and grown to confluency. They were 3 irradiated with 2000 rads. Two x 10 normal human B cells prepared by panning see lc were added to each well, followed by the EBV transformed cells to be cloned, at a rate of one to 5 cells per well. Plates were cultured in a humidified atmosphere in a tissue culture incubator. After 24 hr 10 microliters of medium were added. No further feeding was required. When grown to 3 10 cells well EBV transformed cells were transferred to 96 well plates with human fibroblast feeder cells. Selection for antibody was performed as described hereinabove, Section ld. Test for clonality Two criteria were used 1 restriction to a single type of L chain and to single class of immunoglobulin. The analysis for light chain expression was done by ELISA assay. Class and L chain specific murine monoclonal antibodies to human Ig were used.2 Recloning yielded antibody forring cultured in about 98 of culture wells.Cloning in 96 well plates.An alternate method employed 96 well plates with human irradiated fibroblast as feeder cells. Additional feeder cells were irradiated 1500 rad . Cells of the HPRTnegative variant GM 1500 6TG Croce, C. M., Linnenbach,A., Hall, W., Steplewski, Z. and Koprowski, H. Nature 4 288 488, 1980 , added to the wells at 10 cells well.One to five EBV transformed cells to be cloned were added. Cultures were fed with medium twice a week. After 2 to 3 weeks the culture medium was mixed with 2 hypoxanthine, aminopterin and thymidine HAT to eliminate any growth of feeder cells. Selection for antibody positive cultures is carried out after 4 to 6 weeks, as described hereinabove in Section ld. II. Human mAb to lymphocyte surface antigens HLA DR a Immunization in culture Human PBL were obtained from volunteer donors previously identified to have high titers of anti HLA antibody as a result of pregnancy or blood transfusion. PBL were isolated as described hereinabove under la. PBL were suspended in Mis hell Dutton medium. Irradiated 1500 rad peri pheral blood lymphocytes from the immunized do nors i. e. in case of a pregnancy PBL of the husband or the child served as antigen. Alterna tively an irradiated permanent B cell line de rived by EBV transformation from the immunizing donor may be used. Antigen was added at a rate of 0.1 of PBL to be immunized. The Mishell Dutton culture was performed as described hereinabove under Ib. b Isolation of B cells and transformation This was performed as described hereinabove under Tc. c Screening of supernates for antibody to cell surface antigens The microcytotoxicity assay was applied. To 5 microliters of supernate were added 1 microliter 6 of a suspension of test cells usually 2 x 10 cells ml of transformed B cells of the immunizing donor and 2 microliters of selected rabbit com plement at 1 3 dilution. The assay plates were o incubated at 37 for 45 min., and scored on an inverted microscope after addition of 5 microli ters of trypan blue solution.d Cloning of transformed cells. This procedure may be performed as described by one of the methods of Te. f Assav for specificitv. Antibodies were tested by the microcytotoxicity assay on a wide panel of cells according to standard tissue typing protocols. An example is given in Table 3.

After blocking with BSA, culture fluids are transferred to the plates, which are incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. Plates were washed with Tween PBS, and developing antibody, i. e. rabbit antihuman IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase, was ad ded. After 2 hours1 the plates were washed again and nitrophenylphosphate substrate was added.

The cell mixture was centrifuged and the cell pellet mixed with 1 ml PEG 4000 35 solution for 1 min. at RT. The mixture was then diluted dropwise with EBSS at a rate of 15 microliters in the course of 3 minu tes.The cells were spun down, taken up in PRMI medium containing 2 HAT and plated on irra diated human fibroblast feeder cells in 96 well 5 plates at a density of 10 cell per well. 8 Cultures were fed on the second day with 5 x 10 M ouabain and HAT, and this feeding procedure was continued twice a week thereafter. After 2 weeks cells were harvested, layered on ficoll hypaque and centrifuged. Viable cells from the interface were plated again as before. When vigorous growth occur supernates were screened for antibody as described in 3c. f Characterization of 312a91 anti CMV antibodies Specificity analysis by ELISA technique with standard CMB antigen AD169 Flow Laboratories suggested the presence of anti CMV antibody, hereinafter designated 312a91.4. Immunoflourescence assays with human fibroblasts infected withAD169 cytomegalo virus, but not with uninfected cells, corroborates the specificity for CMV, and moreover suggests a relationship to nuclear CMV antigen. The antibody 312a91.4 does not neutralize CMV.Immunochemical analysis shows that the hybridoma 312a91.4 secretes immunoglobulin G with kappa chain. The anti CMV antibody binds to Protein A.
