# Semiconductor device with interconnection and insulating layers.

## Abstract
To cover the interconnection 2 on a semiconductor de vice 1 at high speed with an insulating film 3 having good step coverage, a dummy pattern 8 is provided around the interconnection 2 and the dummy pattern 8 and the inter connection 2 are covered with the insulating film 3 using the bias sputtering method.
