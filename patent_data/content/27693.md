# Magnesium salts of peroxycarboxylic acids, processes for their preparation and their use as bleaching agents in washing compositions, and processes.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to the provision in solid form of the magnesium salt of certain aromatic, cycloaliphatic or conjugated aliphatic compounds containing a peroxycar boxylic acid group and a carboxylate group, and optionally also an alkyl, carboxylate, sulphonate, nitro, chloro or bromo group, which can be employed as bleaching agents. One especially referred example is magnesium monoperoxyph thalate having the formula
