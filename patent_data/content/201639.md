# Automatic speed variating means for bicycle.

## Abstract
An automatic speed variating means for bicycle includes a pedal 11 having a driving rod 14 , a speed controller 4 having a magnetic actuator 46 driven by the bicycle wheel and a driving chain 3 driven by the driving rod 14 wherein the depression of the pedal 11 may drive the chain 3 for normal bicycle running and the faster bicycle running may operate the magnetic actuator 46 to exert a greater torque to automatically adjust the speed controller 4 for faster speed variation.
