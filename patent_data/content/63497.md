# Linear motor control system for brushless DC motor.

## Abstract
A linear motor control system for a brushless DC motor is disclosed, as shown in figure 2, wherein a plurality of rotor position sensors 86, 88, 90 92 are provided together with means 94 for selecting a first or second group of those sensors, thus enabling alternate sets of position signals to be selected depending upon motor speed. These respective sensor signals are then processed through a filter network 96 to provide sinusoidal motor drive signals which con tinuously modulate motor winding currents to provide linear speed control, thereby resulting in an appreciable decrease in acoustical noise produced by the motor.
