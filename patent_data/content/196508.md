# Apparatus for simulating staticelectricity discharges.

## Abstract
An apparatus for simulating electrostatic discharge used for testing and evaluating the durability and sensitivity of electronic parts and assemblies such as ICs, LS s, and so on, to electrical overstresses and electromagnetic interfernce caused by electrostatic discharges. In the apparatus, an additional electrostatic capacitance element is connected across a discharge gap within which an electrotatic dis charge occurs so that the discharge current through the tested object exhibits a shortened rise time and an increased peak value.
