# Fuel control system for gas turbine engine.

## Abstract
Fuel control system for a gas turbine engine in which a proportional control regulates the fuel flow Wf from a hydromechanical unit 36 based upon an error signal E representing the difference between a demanded speed signal Nd and an actual speed signal Ng . The demanded speed signal Nd is generated by an integrator 32 as the time integral of the difference between the demanded speed signal Nd and a scheduled speed signal Ngs . Additional ly, the difference signal corresponding to the last mentioned difference is limited between an upper limit AL and a lower limit DL , prior to the integration, by a comparator 28 and a limiter circuit 30 .
