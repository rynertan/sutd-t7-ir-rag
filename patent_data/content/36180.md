# Compact camera adapted to be selectively switched between a standard photographic mode and a telephotographic mode at a focal length of more than 200 mm.

## Abstract
A camera in which a supertelephotographic lens system and a standard photographic lens system are arranged in compact within a camera body and a standard viewfinder system and a supertelephotographic viewfinder system are so arranged that an operator can view an image of a subject through the same eyepiece window in either the standard or supertelephotographic mode. In addition, a control means is provided for controlling the use of a built in electronic flash depending upon the selected mode and more particularly for inhibiting the use of the flash in the case of the super telephotographic mode.
