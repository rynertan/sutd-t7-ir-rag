# System for the quantization of signals.

## Abstract
System for the quantization of signals comprising in a transmitter section IR quantizing means KW a difference producer DF1 and filter means G1, H1 . An input signal X and a quantized output signal Y which is derived from the quantizing means and acts as a feedback signal are applied to the difference producer. The output signal of the difference producer is applied by a network G1 to the quantizing means having for the object to quantize the level of the filtered output signal of the difference producer. Filter means G1 are connected into the path of the input signal for relatively influencing the spectrum of the quantizing noise. When digital signals are used the indispensable D A converters from a source of noise owing to threshold inaccuracy. Here, the quantizing means KW are arranged to provide a second quantized output signal V . In the receiver section RC a first received signal Y is applied to a first network H1 and a second received signal V is applied to a second network 1 G1 . The output signals of the two networks are combined to one output signal. The number of quantizing levels of the feedback signal Y may in principle amount to two, in which case the relevant D A converter is free from noise caused by threshold inaccuracy.
