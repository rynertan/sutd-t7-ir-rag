# Fuel pressure regulator.

## Abstract
A fuel pressure regulator comprising a housing 10 , a diaphragm 15 dividing the housing 10 into a first chamber 16 and second chamber 17 , a passage 22 from the exte rior of the housing 10 to the first chamber 16 , an inlet 23 and an outlet 24 associated with the second chamber 17 of the housing 10 , and a valve seat 27 associated with the out let 24 . A cage 19 is mounted on and movable with the dia phragm 15 and a spring 21 within the first chamber 16 yieldingly urges the cage 19 toward the valve seat 27 . The cage 19 supports a pair of plates 29, 30 which retain a valve ball 28 . The first plate 29 has an opening 29a through which a portion of the ball 28 projects and a second plate 30 retains the first plate 29 and the ball 28 within the cage 19 . The first plate 29 is movable transversely to provide for pro per centering of the ball 28 in the valve seat 27 . A light spring 34 extends between the cage 19 and the ball 28 to urge the ball 28 against the first plate 29 .
