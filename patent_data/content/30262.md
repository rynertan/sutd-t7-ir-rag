# An acousto optic transducer device.

## Abstract
A dichroic transducer is disclosed including a light source, a film containing a dichroic material in the path of the light beam and an acoustic information containing wave, and a detector in the path of the modulated light beam for detecting the intensity thereof. The detector may preferably be a fiber optics pickup device.
