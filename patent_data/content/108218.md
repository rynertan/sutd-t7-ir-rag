## Description
CONSTANT RELEASE RATE SOLID ORAL DOSAGE FORMULATION OF PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOUNDS HAVING A HIGH DEGREE OF WATER SOLUBILITY The present invention relates to improved formulations of pharmaceutically active compounds which have a high degree of water solubility such as phenylpropanolamine, chlorpheniramine, isosorbide nitrate and the like, and more specifically relates to constant release rate solid oral dosage formulations of such highly water soluble compounds. While it is axiomatic that an orally administered drug must first dissolve in gastrointestinal fluids in order to be absorbed into the body, medications with a high degree of water.solubility present both formulation and administration problems.Such drugs are difficult to work with and care must be taken during formulation to insure that the tablets contain the proper amount of drug and that the tablets do not degrade and fall apart when exposed to 25 percent or more humidity or instantly upon being ingested. Since such highly water soluble drugs are rapidly absorbed and hence do not exhibit a smooth onset of action or long duration of action, two fold formulation problems exist. Because of the undesirability of having peaks and valleys of active drug in the serum or plasma, and the desirabilit of providing a smoother onset of drug action with a longer duration of pharmacological activity, numerous long acting or sustained release formulations have been marketed for a number of such products for some period of time and a vast body of prior art exists on such formulations. However, in earlier work with drugs which are normally irritating to the gastrointestinal tract and which have undesirable side effects which generally interfere with patlent comIliance and hence lead to inadequate drug therapy, it was found that a constant release rate formulation has a number of advantages over conventional sustained or timed release formulations for products such as aspirin, indomethacin and theophylline hydrochloride.See co pending applications Serial Nos. 366,594, filed April 8, 1982 334,124 filed December 24, 1981 and 364,104 filed Airch 31, 1982 for constant release rate solid oral dosage formulations for aspirin, indomethacin and theophylline hydrochloride. See also United States Patent No. 4,308,251. The discovery of constant order formulations which not only permit once or twice a day dosage regimens, but subs an tially reduce drug side effects, led to work on developing constant order release formulations for other drugs as well. It was found that in view of the widely differing solubilities and other properties of various drug entities, the solution to the problem of developing a superior, constant order solid oral dosage formulation for one drug entity did not provide a solution to the problem of providing constant release formulations for other drug entities unless, as in the present case of highly water soluble drugs, a general solution for a class of drugs sharing similary properties is found.However, in view of the number of factors affecting successful formulation, careful experimentation is required in the development of suitable formulations for various drug entities. As discussed below, there are even a few exceptions within the class of highly water soluble drugs which require a separate solution to the problem of providing constant order release tablets for such drug entities. If highly water soluble drugs are not properly formu lated, the drug will go into solution and be absorbed imnedia tely upon ingestion leading to superb iovailahil ity where theDatient is subjected towa slug of the active drug all at once.This immediate release of the entire dose not only provides immediate, albeit short term drug effect, but also immediate and concentrated side effect. In the past, complicated processes and systems have been employed in formulating highly water .çolubae drups. Such systems have included a hot wax melt system wherein melted wax is poured into the product so that the product becomes embedded in the wax formulating individual beads coated with a release retardant agent such as ethyl cellulose and filling those beads into capsules or puoring the drug into a plastic polymer matrix or sponge such as the Abbott Laboratories GRADUtDET drug delivery system. The present invention not only provides a superior drug formulation for such products, which formulation permits a constant, steady, slow release of drug over a 12 to 24 hour period, but also greatly simplifies the process for fonmilating such drugs and lowers the cost of production. Reviewing the prior art more closely in connection with the present invention, the addition of Carbonol 934 carbomer to various molecular weights of polyethylene glycol to retard the release of active drug from a tablet is well known. See for example Poole, U.S. Patent No. 3,634,584. While Poole disclosed the use of a carbomer and polyehtylene glycol combination, Poole failed to recognize and solve the problem of sticking typically encountered when these two well knsn substances are used together. or did Poole recognize or solve the problem specifically encountered in formulating highly water soluble drugs. In addition toPoole failing to recognize the problem solved by the present invention, Poole neither discloses, nor suggests the instant invention. Similarly, the use of an acrylic acid polymer in conjuction with other polymeric materials such as nolyvinylpyrrolidine is also known. See for example Hill U.S. PatentNo. 3,458,622. However, Hill teaches away from the present invention and clearly failed to recognize the problems inherent in formulating highly water soluble drugs. Specifically, Hill teached the use of methylene chloride as a suitable solvent.However, methylene chloride is incompatible with the formula tions of the present invention, and if used, serves to form a gooey mess which cannot be readily dried and which entraps the methylene chloride in the final granuation. While Hill generally discloses suitable lubricants and binders which are employed in the present invention, Hill failed to recognize and solve the problems solved by the present invention and neither teaches nor suggests the present formulations. The present invention pravides a constant release rate tablet of drugs having a high degree of water solubility such as phenylpropanolamine, ch1oroheniramine, cottibinations of phenylpropanolamine and chlorpheniram m e, isosorhide dinitrate and the like. The tablets of the present invention comprise an intimate admixture of active drug in combination with an acrylic acid polymer, polyethylene glycol or a suitable cellulosic deri fumed silica and a tabletting vative, a hydrogenated vegetable oil, fumed silica and a tabletting lubricant such as magnesium stearate in the critical proportions disclosed hereinbelow. The constant release tablets of the present invention are administered once or twice a day to provide the desired therapeutic effect. FISH. 1 is a graph depicting the dissolution profile of phenylpropanolamine tablets prepared by the method of Example 1. FIG. 2 is a graph showing the dissolution profile of phenylpropanolamine and chlorphenitnsriine tablets prepared br the method of Example 2. FIG. 3 is a graph showing the dissolution profile of isosorbide dinitrate tablets prepared by the method ofExample 3. The constant order release tablets of the present invention comprise an intimate admixture of a therapeutically effective amount of a drug having a liigh degree of water solubility, from about 8 to 18 weight percent and preferably from about 10 to 15 weight percent of an acrylic acid polymer from about 8 to about 18 weight percent and preferably fran about 10 to 15 weight percent of polyethylene glycol having a molecular weight of from about 4000 to 6000 from about 2 to 9 weight percent and preferably from about 4 to 8 weight percent of a hydrogenated vegetable oil from about 0.5 to 3 weight percent of fumed silicon dioxide from about 15 to 25 weight percent and preferably from about 18 to 22 weight percent of a disintegrant from about 20 to about 40 weight percent of a diluent, and from 0.5 to about 2 weight percent of a suitable lubricant. thile there are a number of acrylic acid polymers which should be suitable for use in the practice of the present invention, the only acrylic acid polymer currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for internal human use is a carbomer sold by B4F. Goodrich under the tradenameCARBOPOL 934P. Thus, CARBOPOL 934P carbomer is the presently preferred acrylic acid polymer for use in the practice of this invention until such time as further acrylic acid polymers are approved for human internal use. The preferred hydrogenated vegetable oil is a hydrogenated cottonseed oil sold by E. tindell Corporation under the trademark LUBRITAB. Magnesium stearate is the preferred lubricant, although other standard tabletting lubricants such as talc and the like can be employed in the practice of this invention. In addition to the components listed above, a hydrophobic cellulosic binding agent mar advantageously be incorporated into the formulation The preferred cellulosic binding agent is ethyl cellulose SOcps , dispersed in isopropyl alcohol.In the event it is desired to reduce the bulk of the tablet, the polyethylene glycol may be eliminated and the cellulosic binding agent employed in greater quantity. while a number of standard disintegrants may be employed in the practice of this invention, it is preferred to employ lactose. Similarly, while any number of standard bulking agents may be employed in the present formulations, the preferred bulking agent or diluent is dibasic calcium phosphate. Other suitable bulking agents include microcrystalline cellulose, mannitol, tricalcium phosphate, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol and methyl cellulose. The preferred solvent employed in the process for manu fracturing the tablets of the present invention is lsopropyl alcohol or other suitable lower aliphatic alcohols. Methylene chloride should not be used since this will entrap both the oil and the carbomer and form a rubbery mass which cannot be dried. It is both critical and essential to include fumed silicon dioxide SYLOID 244 as a lubricant as well as magnesium stearate as an adjunctive lubricant to overcome the serious sticking problem encountered when tabletting highly water soluble drugs. The term constant release rate, as used herein, refers to a formulation wherein the in vitro release of active drug from the tablet, using a U.S.P. dissolution apparatus, pH 7.5, is constant and linear against time untill all of the drug is released when plotted on an x,y graph using the following formula K dc dt wherein K stands for constant, dc stands for decreasing concentration and dt stands for decreasing time, a straight line is formed. Calculation of at Least four data points by linear regression analysis should give a value of from 0.85 to 1.0.A value of 1.0 is a perfect straight line. The term highly R ter soluBle , as used herein, refers to drugs falling within the definitions of very soluble or freely soluble on page 203 of Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16th Edition, Mack Publishing Company 1980 . iore specifically, the term, as used herein, refers to drugs which have a solubility of from 1 to 15 grams of drug per ml of water. It should be noted that while a number of drugs are high1 soluble in other solvents, the present invention is limited to drugs which are highly soluble in water. Tncluded within such highly water soluble drugs are phenylpropanolamine, chlorpheniramine, isosorbide nitrate, atropine sulfate, beta methasone sodium phosphate, brompheniramine maleate, clindamycin phosphate, desipramine hydrochloride, dexbromshenir amine maleate, dextroamphetamine hydrochloride, dicyclomine hydrochloride, diethylproprion hydrochloride, ephedrine hydrochloride, fluroazepam, theophylline sodium oleate, tetracycline hydrochloride, morphine sulfate, pentylenetetrazole, physostigmine sulfate, scopolamine hydrobromide and wafarin potassium. It is noted that not all salts of the same drug have the same water solubilities. For instance, while theophylline sodium oleate has a solubility of 6 grars mI of water and may be formulated according to the present invention, theophylline hydrochloride has a solubility of 300 glml and is not suitable for the present formulations. In addition, highly water soluble drugs such as propanol, quinidine and verapamil may not be formulated according to the present invention because of their pK values and suitable formulations for these drugs are being sought. The process for preparing the constant release rate tablets of the present invention is simple, straigfirforward, and results in significant savings in production costs currently encountered in the production of presently available microencapsulation, wax bead or spheroidal coated particles placed in a capsule. For illustrÅative purposes, three highly water soluble drug products, phenylpropanolamine, combination of phenylpropanolamine and chlorpheniramine and isosorbide nitrate were tablet ted according to the present invention. Each tablet of phenylpropanolamine weighed between 400 500 mg and contained 75 mg of active drug. Each tablet of phenylpropanolamine and chlorpheniramine weighed between 450 525 mg and contained 75 mg of phenylpropanolamine and 8 mg of chior pheniramine. Tablets of isos6rbide dinitrate weighed from 260 to 870 mg and contained from 50 to 160 mg of active drug. Generally speaking, all three of these Illustrative drug products are prepared in a similar manner. The active ingredient s , carbomer, diluent, hydrogenated vegetable oil, polyethylene glycol and disintegrant are weighed and carefully mixed as a dry blend. A wet granulation is then prepared by sly nag adding isopropyl alcohol, which may or may not contain dispersed ethylcellulose. The wet powder is then blended until a granule forms. The granulation is dried and reduced through a No. 16 mesh Screen. The syloid and magnesium stearate may be added before granulation or added after the granulate has dried. The screened and blended granules are then compressed in a rotary press or single station tablet press. It is important to note that compositions containing polyethylene glycol and polymers of acrylic acid in conjunctlon withhydrogenated vegetable oil are mechanically difficult to press into a tablet without considerable weight variation in the tablets or sticking to the tablet punches. The classical tabletting lubricants such as talc, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, cetyl alcohol, calcium stearate or zihe stearate are ineffective in alleviating this problem. It was found that the only suitable solution to the problem was the inclusion of 0.5 to 2.0 weight percent of fumed silicon dioxide, sold under the trademark SYLOID 244 by W. GraceCompany. This both alleviates the problem of tablet sticking and serves as a superior lubricant. The polymers which form the basic tablet matix are physically bound by the addition of dibasic calcium phosphate and microcrystalline cellulose. Lactose is employed as a disintegrant. In instances where the drug is highly soluble, enhancement of the retardation effect mar be achieved by the addition of a cellulosic derivative such as ethyl cellulose to enhance the retardation properties of the carbomer and polyethylene glycol matrix. Turning to the preferred process of the present ilivention, all material are weighed and blended for 15 minutes for each 40 kilograms of dry material. Isopropyl alcohol which may constitute 35 60 weight percent is slowly added at a rate of 3 minutes per liter of solvent. If ethylcellulose is to be dispersed in the solvent prior to granulation, the cellulose derivative should be blended until there is complete dispersion and clarity of the solution. Generally, it will take between 35 40 minutes per 125 liters of fluid using a lightening blender to effect complete dispersion and solvation of the ethylcellulose. It is critical that the wet granulation be completely dried before screening. Failure to observe this technique may result in rupture of the granules and a loss of the constant release rate profile of the resulting tablets.In conventional prior art methods, the wet granulations are generally screemed immediately after formation, then dried. If the prior art processes are employed, the constant release rate profile of the tablets may be destroyed. Tablets made by the process described above, and illustrated in detail hereinbelow release their active drug over a specified period of time and in vitro they perform in a constant release rate manner. Because of this unique constant release rate property, the tablets of the present invention may be administered once or twice a day to provide 24 hour pharmacological activity and the desired drug effect.

FIGS. 1 3 and Example 6 demonstrate that tablets prepared according to the present invention exhitit a constant and linear release of drug from the tablet matrix over time. As mentioned above, the addition of a hydrogenated vegetable oil substantially enhances the constant release rate properties of the tablets of this invention and considerably reduces the amount of drug released over a four hour time period as compared to the amount of drug released over the same period from tablets prepared without the addition of this retardant agent. Thus, while it is not critical to add hydrogenated vegetable oil to the acrylic acid resin based formulations of the present invention, it is greatly preferred to do so in order to achieve the optimum results.
