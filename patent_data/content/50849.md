Alkyl of 1 6 carbon atoms inclusive represented in the foregoing structural formula is typified by methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl and the branched chain isomers thereof. Also included in the invention are the individual stereoisomers, and the mixture of isomers, wherein an alpha and beta isomer mixture is represented by the wavy lines in the above formula. Further, Alpha configurations are represented by a dashed line, and Beta configurations are represented by a thick line, in the above formula. Compounds of the present invention wherein Y is a cis vinylene group can be represented by the formulaEMI2.1 where R, R1 and n are as defined above. Particularly preferred compounds of this group are those compounds wherein n is 3 and R1 is CH3. Compounds of the present invention wherein Y is a trans vinylene group can be represented by the formulaEMI2.2 wherein R, R1 and n are as defined above. Detailed Description of the Invention The novel compounds of the present invention display valuable pharmacological properties as is exemplified by their ability to inhibit the gastric secretion stimulated by secretogogues suc,h as histamine and pentagastrin while furthermore possessing the surprising advantage of lacking the potent undesirable side effects displayed by related substances. The specific assay used to detect gastric anti secretory activity is described as follows. Adult female beagle dogs weighing 13 20 kg. are prepared with denervated fundic Heidenhain pouches. After a recovery period of at least 4 weeks following surgery, the animals are fasted for approximately 20 hours, then are placed in Pavlov stands and infused intravenously with saline solutions The pouched secretions are collected every 15 minutes and measured for volume and total acidity by titration with 0.1 N sodium hydroxide to pH 7.0.Following a 30 minute basal secretion the dogs are infused with a saline solution of histamine di hydrochloride at a dose of 1.0 mglhr. A steady state plateau of gastric secretion is obtained approximately 1 hour following the start of histamine infusion, at the end of which time the test compound dissolved in an ethanolic iso osmotic phosphate buffer solution, is administered by a single intraveneous injection. The duration of theanti secretory effects is determined and the side effects, if any, recorded. The compound is rated active if statistically significant inhibition of secretory parameters occur following compound treatment. Starting materials suitable for the manufacture of the compounds of the present invention are the cyclopent l enealkanoic acids and esters of the formula EMI4.1 wherein Y is as defined hereinbefore, R2 is a protecting group such as tri lower alkyl silyl, tetrahydrofuranyl or tetrahydropyranyl and R3 is hydrogen, or alkyl of 1 6 carbon atoms, inclusive. The manufacture of these starting materials are described in Examples 1 12 and is outlined in the following chart. CHART B EMI5.1 EMI6.1 Introduction of the oxygenated trans vinyl side chain at the 2 position of the cyclopentane ring is effected by reaction with a suitable organometallic reagent. The oxygenated trans vinyl side chain groups are manufactured from the corresponding acetylenes by the process described bJPappo et al in Chemistry, BiochemIstry, and PharmacologicalActivity of Prostanoids, 17 26 1979 . The examples describe the manufacture of a trans vinylstian ne starting material from the corresponding acetylene. After the side chain is introduced, the oxygen protecting groups a re conveniently removed with a weak acid solutibn such ds acetic acid. Compounds where R is a hydroxymethylketo group are manufactured from a corresponding hydroxycyclopentenone as exemplified in Example 11. The hydroxymethylketo compound is prepared by the conjugate addition approach. When a resolved side chain is substituted for the racemic side chain there is formed a mixture of diastereoisomers. This mixture of diastereoisomers may then be chromatographed to afford the individual stereoisomeric products. The invention will appear more fully from the examples which follow.
