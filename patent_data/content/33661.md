## Description
A THIEF DETECTION DEVICE This invention relates to Thief Detection AidDevices. A device known as the Scorpion has been in general use by banks and agencies where large cash transactions occur. It is in the form of a hollow stack of bank notes housing a battery and a detonator with a reed switch interconnecting them and a dye reservoir, and is normally seated in an individual holder provided with a magnet for retaining the reed switch in an inoperative condition. When removed from its holder the device, after a predetermined time delay, detonates and disseminates a permanent dye. This device has been successful in the apprehension of bank robbers, and the like. However, some inconvenience arises by the need for the device to be always kept in its holder while the mere dye marking of the surroundings by a detonating device is sometimes not sufficient for subsequent detection of the robber or his booty. It is a prime object of the invention, therefore, to provide a device as an aid to the detection of a thief and or the recovery of his booty which does not require any special storage provision. The invention in one general form provides a thief detection aid device comprising a hollow housing constructed to simulate the external appearance of a bundle of banknotes, electrical solid state circuitry together with individual power supply within the housing and including an electromagnetic sensor and an output switch responsive thereto, a detonator charge associated with disseminating dye within the housing and activated by said switch, timing means imposing a predetermined delay in activation of said detonator charge after energization of said sensor, and a signal transmitter within a reinforced compartment within the housing for protection against damage to said transmitter with activation of said detonator and also being activated by said electromagnetic sensor, whereby,passage from a quiescent to an active state of the device occurs with electromagnetic energization of said sensor and signal contact with the device is maintained after detonation of said charge. The invention will be understood more readily from the following description in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 shows in perspective one form of the device of the invention in half transverse section Figure 2 is a similar view of another form of the device Figure 3 depicts schematically a solid state receiver for incorporation within the device of Figure 1 Figure 4 depicts schematically a transmitter for activation of the device of Figure 1 Figure 5 depicts schematically a solid state transmitter for incorporation within either device of Figure 1 or Figure 2 Figure 6 depicts schematica lly a command transmitter for activation of the device of Figure 2 and, Figure 7 depicts schematically a solid state receiver for incorporation within the device of Figure 2 to respond to the transmitter of Figure 6. The invention will now be described in more detail in respect of two independent applications of the device.In both applications as shown sepa rately in Figs. 1 and 2 the device 8 or 9 is accommodated within a housing 10 which simulates the external appearance of a bundle 11 of banknotes. In most banks and similar agencies banknotes are stored either in a fold comprising ten notes folded about their mid point, and a bundle of notes which comprise ten folds arranged in a stack. Sometimes larger bundles consisting of twenty five folds of notes are used and this size bundle is of ideal dimensions for simulation by the device 8 or 9 of this invention. In each instance the folds 12 and the entire bundle 11 are bound by paper wrappers or elastic bands which are not shown in the drawings . It is intended according to the application of the device 8 shown by Fig. 1, that it will be stored within a teller s cash drawer and becomes activated when passing through an induced electromagnetic field about the doorway to the premises. In respect of the second application shown by Fig. 2, the device 9 willbe located within a satchel used to carry pay rolls and the like between a carrier vehicle, such as an armoured car, and a bank or payroll office. Activation of the device 9 occurs as a deliberate action originating from say an occupant of the vehicle by electromagnetic signalling whenever a robbery involving the satchel occurs. To this end, in respect. of the first application and, therefore, the form shown in Fig. 1 the device 8 is accommodated within a housing 10 comprising a cavity 15 around which is formed a covering of paper strips simulating the external appearance of the edges of a bundle 11 of banknotes. Complete and genuine banknotes 13 and 14 of the same denomination are placed over the outer faces of the hollow housing 10 thus formed. To the casual observer the housing 10 will appear to be a bundle 11 of banknotes similar in form to other bundles normally stored within.a teller s cash drawer. The teller, of course, will be required to keep the device separate from genuine banknote bundles. A receiver Fig. 3 composed of electric solid state circuitry preferably of integrated form, is located within the cavity 15. Two dye chambers 16 and 17 are also provided in the cavity 15 in association with a detonator charge not shown . Preferably, a wall of the receptacle bounding these chambers 16 and 17 is of weakened form to effect a degree of control over the direction of dissemination of the dye upon detonation. Dry cells are included within a battery chamber 18. Preferably, the receiver is of the form shown by Fig. 3. Three separate receiving detectors 19, 20 and 21 associated with individual orthogonal sensor coils 22, 23 and 24 are tuned to 30 KHz and apply a received signal of that frequency to a detector amplifier and clamp 25, which in cases where for security coded, or modulated, signalling is utilized, serves as a decoder, amplifier, filter, counter and clamp.An output derived from amplifier 25 upon receipt of a correct signal is applied to activate a timer 26 and by line X to activate a UHF transmitter also contained within the housing 10.Upon lapsing of a predetermined time period the timer 26 activates a detonator firing circuit 27 which in turn applies power from the batteries to fire the detonators associated with the dye chambers 16 and 17 Fig. 1 . A UF transmitter shown in Fig. 5 is located within a reinforced compartment within the cavity 15 to avoid damage thereto whenever detonation occurs. The transmitter preferably transmits at a frequency of about 880MHz and with a power of 0.5W and.ncludes an output antenna 28 and an input microphone 29. An activation signal from the receiver of Fig. 3 when applied over line X switches on a crystal controlled oscillator 30, a phase modulator 31 to which the microphone 29 is connected by an amplifier limiter bandshaper circuit 32, and the series of frequency multipliers 33, 34 and 35. The output of the latter is passed through a power amplifier 36 to the antenna 28 which is preferably a turned loop.Thus dye marking of the device s surroundings will occur with each activation, and subsequently by virtue of the transmitter conversations or other sounds in the vicinity of the device 8 will be broadcast. This facility will greatly assist law enforcement officers in locating and apprehending those responsible for or accessory to the robbery. Hence, a device 8 constructed as above described will normally remain in a quiescent state under normal conditions of commerce but can be rendered active under abnormal conditions. This will require the installation of a transmitter antenna loop about the access doorway to the premises within which the device 8 normally resides, and which is energized by loop exciter apparatus of the required frequency. Preferably a control switch is incorporated to remove the field when not required. Fig. 4 shows such apparatus in the form of a 30Hz transmitter provided with an output loop antenna 37. The transmitter preferably comprises a 900 phase shift circuit 38 connected for feedback from the output antenna 37 to a phase locked oscillator and comparator 39 connected through a biphase interface 40 to the input of a pair of push pull power amplifiers 41 and 42 and thence to a 30Hz tuned transformer 43 for application to the output antenna 37. Power is applied over smoothing choke 44 to the circuit from a battery source 45 maintained on float charge from a power rectifier 46 connected with the mains power. When modulated or coded signals are utilized a programmable modulator 47 may be added. In the second application of the invention, shown by Figs. 2, 6 and 7 the device 8 will contain a UHF receiver to receive a command signal from a control station, such as an armoured car. A command transmitter see Fig. 6 operative at an assigned ultra high frequency will therefore be provided within the car and will incorporate for security against intentional or unintentional intrusion an encoder 48 which is either pre programmed, key programmed or keyboard operated. Operation of the transmitter is controlled via the input line 49. The transmitting frequency is determined by the crystal controlled oscillator 50 and frequency multipliers 51, 52 and 53 while the output power is supplied from the UHF amplifier 54 to the antenna 55.The encoder 48 is connected by a parallel to series converter 56 associated with timing generators 57 to a modulator 58 for imposing a coded command signal on the carrier of the transmitter. The UHF receiver see Fig. 7 is located within the cavity 15 of the device 8 in place of the 30KHz receiver described in connection with the previously discussed form of the invention. This receiver is fed from a tuned loop input antenna 59 through an R.F. amplifier 60 to a converter 61 supplied from a local crystal controlled oscillator 62 whose frequency corresponds to the carrier of the transmitter of Fig. 6. The output of converter 61 is amplified through the I.F. amplifier 63 and demodulated in circuit 64 whose output is passed via a noise quench circuit 65 and series to parallel converter 66 provided with timing generators 67 to a comparator 68 where comparison with a reference signal is made. This signal is obtained from a memory 69 which is either pre programmed or key programmed. The output of the comparator 68 is then applied via line Y to a similar detonation circuit as the timer 26 and circuit 27 of Fig. 3. An activating signal will also be sent to theUHF transmitter inbuilt into the device 8. Preferred embodiments have been described in the foregoing passages but it should be realised that other forms and modifications are possible within the scope of this invention.
