# Process for the detection and or determination of components of the reaction between a specific binding protein and the corresponding bindable substance in an aqueous test sample freeze dried reagent and test kit to be used in the process.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a method for the detec tion and or determination of one or more components of the reaction between a specific binding protein and the corres ponding bindable substance, in which one or more labelled components are used, that are obtained by coupling particles of a dispersion of a metal, metal compound or polymer nucle√Ø, coated with a metal or metal compound, having a particle size of at least 5 nm, directly or indirectly to the desired component of said reaction. During the reaction or after an adequate reaction time, the physical properties and or the amount of the metal and or the formed metal containing agglomerate, is are determined in the test sample, or optionally after a separation of the bound and free metal labeled components in one of the derived fractions by methods known by themselves.
