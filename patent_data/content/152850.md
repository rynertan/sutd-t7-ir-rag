# APPARATUS FOR COMB HONEY

## Abstract
Apparatus for producing comb honey in a hive and for marketing thereof. Cassettes each include a boxlike base and a removable cover. The cassettes are stackable in side by side horizontal columns in a super. The side by side cassettes are constructed so that bees or structure in one cassette can influence production of comb honey in the ad jacent cassette, to induce filling with honey to a uniform depth across the full width of each cassette.
