## Description
The present invention relates to a coffin delivery system for a metallurgical furnace. Metallurgical furnaces of the type for sintering and other heat treatment of powdered metals, ceramics and the like, such as carbide, typically comprise an elongated furnace chamber surrounded by a pressure vessel. A door or hatch provides access to at least one and often time both ends of the furnace chamber and through which the parts to be processed are positioned into the furnace chamber. Typically, the parts are loaded onto a flat plate or into a box type carrier, conventionally called the coffin, which is positioned within the furnace chamber. For large metallurgical furnaces, the coffin together with the parts often times weighs in excess of 453.60 Kg. In order to load the coffin into these previously known furnaces, it has been the previous practice to utilise a highlo truck to both lift the coffin and place the coffin within the furnace chamber. A primary disadvantage of this previously known practice is that a relatively large amount of clearance must be provided along both the sides and top of the furnace chamber This clearance is required to provide sufficient handling room for the highlo truck as well as a vertical clearance to both lift and lower the coffin within the furnace chamber. Unless sufficient clearance is provided, the furnace would be damaged by the truck and or coffin. A primary disadvantage of the necessity of providing both vertical and horizontal clearance space within the furnace chamber is that it increases the overall volume of the chamber with unnecessary and unused space. The increased volume of the furnace chamber in turn increases the power of consumption for the furnace by the cube of the increased volume. US A 1842981 discloses a high temperature metallurgical furnace having an elongated furnace chamber with a bottom, top and two sides and access means to said chamber, said furnace including a delivery system comprising US A 1788685 discloses a high temperature metallurgical furnace particularly a carburizing furnace having an elongated furnace chamber with a bottom, top and two sides and access means at the two ends of said chamber including a coffin delivery system comprising The rollers are arranged in several rows, said rollers in each row being spaced apart and parallel with each other and spaced apart and axially aligned with the rollers of the other row. The rollers are cylindrical in shape. The bottom of said coffin includes two channels formed by guides, each channel being in registration with one row of rollers, said rollers being partially positioned in said channel, the length of the rollers being substantially equal to the width of said channel. Neither the provision of stop means at the mid point of the chamber nor the possibility of having two coffins loaded and unloaded at each end of the furnace is suggested in these documents. The present invention provides a coffin delivery system as disclosed in claim 1 which overcomes all the above mentioned disadvantages of the previously known delivery system for metallurgical furnaces. In brief, the coffin delivery system of the present invention comprises a plurality of rollers which are secured to the bottom of the furnace chamber so that the axis of the rollers extends transversely with respect to the axis of the furnace chamber. In use, the coffin is placed on the rollers so that the rollers frictionally engage the bottom of the coffin and guide the coffin into the furnace chamber. In the preferred form of the invention, the coffin includes at least one elongated channel along its bottom which registers with the rollers so that the rollers are positioned in the coffin channels. Alternatively the coffin includes at least two upwardly extending channels formed in its bottom, one channel being in registration with each row of rollers, said rollers being partially positioned in said channels. These channels thus guide the coffin as it is loaded into or unloaded from the furnace chamber thus effectively eliminating the need for any side or vertical clearance in the furnace chamber. Preferably the metallurgical furnace includes at least one heating coil having a leg positioned adjacent said furnace bottom, said coil leg being positioned between said rollers. The rollers are preferably constructed from graphite or consolidated carbon. A better understanding of the present invention will be had upon reference to the following detailed description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference characters refer to like parts throughout the several views, and in which With reference first to Figures 1 and 2, a portion of a metallurgical furnace is there shown having an elongated furnace chamber 10 which is generally square in cross sectional shape and open at each end 12 and 14. Conventionally, the furnace chamber 10 is surrounded by insulation panels 16 while one or more heating coils 18 are positioned within the furnace chamber 10 and closely adjacent the insulation panels 16. The heating coils 18 will be subsequently described in greater detail. In addition, a first door or hatch 20 provides access to one end 12 of the furnace chamber 10 while a second hatch 22 provides access to the other end 14 of the furnace chamber 10. With reference now to Figures 1 3, a plurality of cylindrical rollers 30 are rotatably mounted to the bottom of the furnace chamber 10 by roller mounts 32. The rollers 30 are preferably arranged in two longitudinal extending rows 34 and 36 so that the rollers 30 in each row 34 and 36 are spaced apart and parallel with respect to each other. In addition, the rollers 30 in one row 34 are coaxial with the rollers 30 in the other row 36 so that the axis of each roller 30 is transverse with respect to the longitudinal axis of the furnace chamber 10. With reference now particularly to Figure 4, although the rollers 30 can be of any conventional construction, in the preferred form of the invention, each roller 30 includes a cylindrical axle 38 which extends between and is secured to the roller mounts 32. A tubular and cylindrical tube 40 is positioned coaxially around and spaced radially outwardly from the shaft 38 while cylindrical roller bearings 42 are positioned in between the axle 38 and roller tube 40 so that the tube 40 freely rotates with respect to the axle 38. The axle 38, roller bearings 42 and roller tube 40 are all constructed of a high temperature deformation resistant material, such as graphite or consolidated carbon. Such a material is necessary since the rollers remain within the furnace chamber during the heat treating metallurgical process. With reference now particularly to Figures 1 and 2, the rollers 30 are adapted to frictionally engage the bottom 50 of a carrier or coffin 52 in which the parts to be heat treated are contained. The coffin 52 is generally conventional in construction except that it includes two upwardly extending longitudinal channels 54 formed in its bottom 50. Each channel 54 registers with one row 34 or 36 of the rollers 30 so that the portion of the rollers 30 are positioned within the channels 54. Thus, in use, the rollers 30 rotatably support and guide the coffin 52 into the interior of the furnace chamber 10. With reference now particularly to Figures 2 and 3, preferably an upwardly extending stop 60 is secured to a mid point of the furnace bottom so that the stop 60 extends transversely across the bottom. The stop 60, together with the dual access doors 20 and 22 enable one coffin 52 to be loaded into the furnace chamber 10 from each end. The stop 60 is dimensioned so that it abuts against the inner end of each coffin 52 thus limiting the extension of the coffin 52 into the furnace chamber 10. With reference now to Figures 1 3, preferably three heating coils 18 are positioned within the furnace chamber and closely adjacent the insulation panels 16. Each heating coil 18 is generally rectangular in shape and includes two sides 72 and 74, a top 76 and a bottom 78. A unitary bus bar 80 is a bus bar containing two separated parts 82 and 84 which are provided at each other corner of the heating coil 18. As best shown in Figure 3, a pair of heating rods 86 extend between and are connected with each registering pair of bus bar parts 82 or 84 or with the unitary bus bar 80. A source of electrical power is interconnected between the bus bar parts 82 and 84 at the corner of the heating coil 18 which is diagonal from the unitary bus bar 80. Consequently, electrical power from the source 88 first flows through the heating rods 86 which interconnect the bus bar parts 82 to the bus bar 80. From the bus bar 80, the current flows through the heating rods 86 which interconnect the bus bar parts 84 and back to the power source 88. The construction of the heating coil 18 is advantageous in several different respects. First, since the heating rods 86 extending along the sides 72 and 74, top 76 and bottom 78 of the heating coil are equal in length, the electrical current is equally distributed or balanced in each heating rod 86, thus providing a uniform temperature for each heating rod 86 and thus a uniform temperature for the furnace chamber 10. Furthermore, since only two heating rods 86 extend in between the bus bar parts 82 or 84 and or the unitary bus 80, any thermal distortion of the heating coil 18 caused by thermal expansion of the heating rods 86 will be compensated for automatically. This automatic compensation may result in slight twisting of the parallelogram formed by a pair of heating rods 86 and the bus bar parts 82 and 84 but otherwise will not damage the heating coil. Having described the invention, it is apparent that the present invention provides a unique coffin delivery system for a metallurgical furnace. Since the rollers automatically guide the coffin into the interior of the furnace chamber, only a very small clearance between the coffin and the heating coils 18 is required. A still further advantage of the present invention is the provision of the heating coil 18 which allows the electrical power source to be connected between two adjacent bus bar parts 82 and 84 at the bottom of the furnace chamber and still obtain an automatic balance of the electrical current through the heating rods 86. A still further advantage of the heating coil of the present invention is that slight thermal distortion of the heating coil does not damage the heating coil.
