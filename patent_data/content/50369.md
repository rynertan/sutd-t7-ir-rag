# Drive assembly for a video recorder playback machine.

## Abstract
A drive assembly for a video recorder playback machine is provided for controlled linear translation of an optics carriage 30 including an optical record play back head 34 in a radial direction with respect to a video information disc 14 . The optics carriage is mount ed for radial displacement along a linear track assembly. and is connected to a sleeve type push block 46 re ceived about a precision lead screw 48 . The push block is biased by a spring 66 axially toward a floating center coupling 54 which in turn couples the push block with limited axial misalignment against rotation with respect to a lead screw nut 52 . Rotation of the lead screw causes axial translation of the lead screw nut for effecting corresponding linear translation of the push block and the optics carriage.
