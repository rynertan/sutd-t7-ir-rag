## Abstract
Disclosed herein is an apparatus for blowing a powdery refining agent into a refining vessel 21 which is adapted to blow the powder into a molten metal bath 22 of the refining vessel together with a refining gas by feeding the powder from a pressure vessel 27 to a main pipe 24 for the supply of the refining gas. The pressure vessel is connected to the main pipe through a plurality of transportation pipes 33,35 each provided with an on off valve 36 and connected to a secondary gas pipe 38 for introduction of the refining gas downstream of the on off valve 36 . The secondary gas pipe 38 is provided with a flow control valve 39 .
