## Description
Beverage vending machine The invention relates to vending machines of the kind for dispensing a selection of beverages, the beverages being prepared by an appropriate quantity of powdered or granular material being mixed with hot or cold water as required. Such beverages selectable by appropriate push buttons, may be, for example, tea, coffee, hot chocolate, soup and a variety of soft drinks, and in the case of tea and coffee, for example,a consumer can also select the addition of sugar and or milk, when required, according to his particular pfference. Previously known vending machines of this kind have generally included funnels or bowls in which the selected ingredients have been mixed with water and although the machine has been programmed so that the funnel or bowl concerned is flushed out with clean water following each serving of beverage, the flushing water reducing the strength of the mixed beverage to the required palatable strength, this has not been altogether satisfactory and it has sometimes been found that a dispensed beverage has been tainted by a residue of the previously dispensed beverage. For this reason, and for reasons of hygiene, it has generally been necessary for the mixing funnels or bowls and dispense nozzles of such previously known vending machines to be cleaned daily. This has been both inconvenient and costly. In a previous attempt to solve this problem it has been proposed to provide, instead of a common mixing funnel or bowl, a plurality of paper or synthetic plastics cups each of which has been pre loaded with an appropriate quantity of powdered or granular material according to the beverage which is to be provided. It has in fact been known to provide a selection of such disposable cups preloaded with different ingredients but although such machines have worked reasonably well thobviously cannot, for reasons of available space and complexity, provide the wide range of available beverages which can be obtained in a machine having a selection of push buttons for added ingredients such as sugar and milk. In other words, they have not been able to provide the number of permutations which it is desirable to provide in a beverage vending madine. In another previous attempt to solve the problem referred to, it has been proposed to provide a vending machine having at least one container dispensing station for dispensing individual containers from a stack or store thereof, and a plurality of ingredients dispensing stallions, said machine comprising a conveyor having a carriage and associated support means adapted and arranged to receive and support a container at the said container dispensing station and to present said container sequentially at each ingredient dispensing station and control means provided for causing or allowing said container to receive a portion of at least one ingredient and a discharge station where the container together with the ingredients is discharged from the support means of the conveyor wherein on disengaaement of the container from the support means the conveyor is reversed to return the carriage to a datum position. Such a machine obviously does not suffer from the problem of a dispensed beverage having been tainted by a residue of a previously dispensed beverage and, depending on the number of dispensing stations provided, is capable of providing a wide range of available beverages. However, because the conveyor need to be reversed to return the carriage to a datum position. a number of servings cannot be obtained in a very short space of time. This is because a container cannot commence its traverse along the support means, to be presented sequentially at each ingredient dispensing station, until the immediately preceeding container has been discharged from the support means and the carriage has been returned to the datum position. The invention as claimed is intended to remedy the above drawbacks. It solves the problem of how to design a beverage vending machine in which the mixing of the beverage takes place in the disposable cup in which it is to be served whilst at the same time the machine is capable of providing a wide range of available beverages and of delivering a number of selected beverages in a very short space of time. The advantages offered by the invention are mainly that the beverages dispensed are not tainted by a residue of previously dispensed beverages, that the range of beverages available is not unduly limited, and that a number of servings can be dispensed in a very short space of time. In order that the invention may be fully understood and readily carried into effect, the same will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, of which Figure 1 is a perspective view of a beverage vending machine a part of a side wall of which has been shown broken away from clarity, Figure 2 is a plan view of a cup transport arrangement forming part of the machine, Figure 3 is a view in the direction of arrow 3 in Figure l,and Figure 4 is a view on the line 4 4 in Figure 2. Referring now to the drawings, the beverage vending machine there illustrated is contained within a cabinet 10 a part of a side wall of which is shown broken away so that part of the internal mechanism can be seen. As shown, the machine is provided with a magazine 12 of disposable cups 14, the magazine being constituted by an indexable head having a plurality of locations for separate stacks of cups, means not shown being provided for bringing about an indexing movement of the head when a sensing device not shown senses exhaustion of a stack of cups at a position indicated 16 from which the cups are fed in turn. The machine is also provided with means for feeding a disposable cup from the magazine of cups in increments of movement through successive loading stations in turn, that is to say through successive positions in which the cups will be charged with pre selected powdered or granular materials. These means include an endless band or belt 18 which encircles a drive pulley 20 and a plurality of idler pulleys 22 so arranged that, as best seen in Figure 2, the belt has parallel runs 24, 26 moving in one direction as indicated by the arrows.The arrangement is such that a cup released from the magazine can fall between the parallel runs of endless band or belt and by virtue of the usual taper of the cup and the usual bead formed around its upper edge , and of the appropriate spacing of said runs of band or belt, can jam between them to be carried to the loading stations in turn. Units of dispensing apparatus for the powdered or granular materials constituting concentrates of the available beverages and for sugar and powdered milk are located, respectively, above the successive loading stations referred to and are generally indicated 28. For economy of space, the separate units are arranged side by side and in oppositely disposed pairs but for the sake of clarity only those at one side of the parallel runs of endless band or belt are shown in Figure 1 .Each unit includes a material canister 30, a holding chamber generally indicated 32 for a measure of the material concerned, said holding chamber being secured to a side wall of the canister 30, and means for metering a correct measure of the material from the material canister into said holding chamber, said means being constituted by a screw conveyor 34 arranged to displace material through an aperture in the side wall of the canister. The holding chamber is constituted by a synthetic plastics body part 36 with a cylindrical aperture opening from its underside and by a length of flexible tube 38 which depends from said body part and forms a lower portion of said holding chamber. The lower end of the length of flexible tube 38 is normally clamped shut by clamping means generally indicated 40. An electric solenoid 42 is provided for releasing the clamping means 40 against the pressure of a spring 44. When a disposable cup reaches the end of the track constituted by the parallel runs 24, 26 of band or belt,having passed through the loading stations and, at least at one of said loading stations, been charged with a measure of powdered or granular material, it falls down a chute 46 to arrive at a delivery station 48. Means not shown are provided at said delivery station for the charging of the cup with hot water and of course if one of the beverages which can be selected is a cold fruit drink, for example, the machine will additionally be provided with means for charging a cup with cold water where appropriate . A sliding window 50gives access to the delivery station so that when the cup has been charged with water and the pre selected beverage has been produced the user can raise the window and extract the disposable cup containing his pre selected beverage. The control means for the machine, that is to say the push buttons for pre selecting a required beverage, the various electric motors, relays and the like by means of which the separate functions referred to above are brought into action in timed sequence, are largely of a kind well known to those skilled in the art. However, in Figure 4, there is illustrated the manner in which the disposable cups are arranged to pause at pre selected locations along the track on which they travel, that is to say at those locations where they are to be charged with the pre selected powdered or granular materials As shown, a drive shaft 52 on which the drive pulley 20 is mounted is driven at its lower end by a geared down electric motor unit 54.Intermediate its ends the drive shaft is provided with a number of cams 56 corresponding to the total number of loading stations along the track, the drive pulley 20 being of such a circumference that the follower of each cam is arranged to be actuated when a disposable cup reaches a particular loading station. The cam followers are arranged to activate respective relays, generally indicated 58 but only those which have been pre selected for activation interrupt the operation of the motor unit at the appropriate times.The relays are associated with respective timers so that the motor unit is re started after an appropriate interval of time. By virtue of the fact that the machine does not include funnels or bowls in which successive servings of a particular beverage are mixed it has been found that it dQs not need the frequent cleaing which previously known vending machines have required. In fact, the material canisters 30 have been made so large, and the magazine of disposable cups has been made of such a capacity that, typically, a service engineer may need to visit such a machine to clean and replenish it only weekly instead of daily as might be required with a previously known machine. Various modifications may be made. For example, different means may be provided whereby the disposable cups are displaced along the track in turn. It will also be understood that the track need not necessarily be a straight line track. It is not essential that the units of dispensing apparatus for the powdered or granular materials concerned should be as described and illustrated, that is to say they need not each include separate holding chambers for a required measure of the material concerned. The dispensing apparatus in each case could be of a more conventional kind. The disposable cups, when charged with the preselected powdered or granular material, need not necessarily fall down a chute to arrive at the delivery station. The latter could be constituted by the final position of a cup beyond the end of the track along which it has moved to be charged with the material. It is however, usually essential for any moving parts of a machine of this kind to be inaccessible to persons using the machine. A machine of this kind will usually only be provided for the serving of hot beverages such as tea, coffee, soup and the like. However, it could quite well be programmed for the serving of chilled beverages in addition to hot beverages and in this case the machine could be provided with a cold water tank with a so called ice bank if desired.
