## Description
A PROCESS FOR THE CO PRODUCTION OF AN ALKYLIDENE DICARBOXYLATE AND A CARBOXYLIC ACID This invention relates to a process for the co production of an alkylidene dicarboxylate and a carboxylic acid. US Patent Specification No. 3,579,566 discloses that the hydrogenation of a carboxylic acid anhydride to give an alkylidene dicarboxylate plus an acid may be carried out using a catalyst comprising a complex of a Group VIII noble metal with a trihydrocarbyl phosphine. However, the reaction products obtained by this process are complex mixtures. and the yield of the desired dicarboxylate is very low. In particular, the yield of carboxylic acid which, according to the stoichiometry of the reaction should be formed in a quantity equinolar with the dicarboxylate, is formed in large excess. Thus in Example 1 of said specification, the molar ratio of acetic acid to ethylidene diacetate is 6.7 1. Further, the temperatures and pressures required for the reaction are very high. UK Application No. 2,03Li,307 discloses that this hydrogenation process can be improved somewhat by carrying out the reaction using an insoluble metal hydrogenation catalyst, such as palladium on charcoal. in the presence of a strong protonic acid. However, the molar ratio of acetic acrid to ethylidene diacetate produced is in most cases much greater than one, and the yields obtained are generally low. In particular. the results obtained when usingHCl, HBr or HI as the strong acid, are markedly inferior to the results obtained using other acids. giving very poor yields and selectivities. A further mayor disadvantage of this process is that it requires a hydrogen stream which is substantially free from carbon monoxide gas. Despite the statement at lines 14 to 16 page 2 of said specification.the presence of even small quantities of carbon monoxide dramatically reduces both the yield and the selectivity of the reaction see comparative examples 14 and 15 grin . This is a disadvantage since a convenient source qf hydrogen available to industry is that present in synthesis gases, which are carbon monoxide hydrogen mixtures. UK Patent Specification No. 1,538,782, discloses that ethyl dene diacetate can be prepared by reacting methyl acetate and or dimethyl ether, with carbon monoxide and hydrogen, in the presence of a group VIII noble metal catalyst and a source of halide. Large quantities of acetic anhydride are formed as by product. The following passageoccurs in the specification The mechanism of the reaction or reactions occur ring is not known.It is unlikely, however. that the desired ethylidene diacetate is primarily formed by reaction i.e.. reduction of acetic anhydride with hydrogen present in the system, a reaction disclosed by Fenton inUS Patent No. 3,579.566, because of the behaviour of the reaction system of this invention in the presence of especially preferred catalyst systems. According to recognized reaction mechanism postulates with such prefer red catalyst systems see Khan and Martell, Homogeneous Catalysts of Metal Complexes. Vol.I, Academic Press, New York 1974 at pages 49 and 315 , the formation of organo metallic complexes of such catalysts with acid anhydrides would be expected to be far less favored than would the formation of such complexes with suspected reaction intermediates such as acyl halides.The ready formation of such complexes with acyl halides leads to facile reduction of the acyl halide in compar son to the acid anhydrides which would tend to preclude involvement of anhydride reduction as a significant factor in the observed ethylidene diacetate formation reaction . This reasoning is indeed persuasive. The concentra tions of acetic anhydride produced in the process are large, and it would be expected that. if hydrogenation of acetic anhydride could take place under the reaction conditions, it would do so and the acetic anhydride would be converted to ethylidene diacetate plus acetic acid in situ. Thus the acetic anhydride appears to be an undesired by product formed from one of the reaction intermediates, rather than an intermediate itself. It has now been found that carboxylic acid anhydrides can be used as feedstock in a process for the co production of alkylidene dicarboxylates and carboxylic acids.which process gives very high selectivity to the desired products. The invention therefore provides a process for the coproduction of an alkylidene dicarboxylate and a carboxylic acid. characterized in that a carboxylic acid anhydride is hydrogenated in the presence of carbon monoxide and a homogeneous Group VIII metal catalyst together with a chloride, bromide or iodide and in the additional presence of a promotor comprising an organo oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic or antimony compound having a lone pair of electrons. A wide range of carboxylic acid anhydrides can be used as feedstock in the process according to the invention. In general terms, the reaction proceeds according to the equation EMI3.1 Preferably a symmetrical anhydride is used as feedstock.so that only a single dicarboxylate and a single carboxylic acid are produced. However. the reduction can if desired be carried out using a mixed anhydride .e., the R s are different in which case a mixture of products is obtained. In certain circumstances, the groups R in the product may differ from the groups R in the anhydride.For example, if an R in the anhydride contains an olefinic double bond. this will be hydrogenated under the reaction conditions and products containing the cor espon ding saturated R group will be obtained. Preferably, each R in the anhydride independently represents an alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl or aryl group, which may if desired be substituted by one or more substituents, for example halogen atoms, phenyl groups and alkoxy groups, but are preferably unsubstituted, and preferably have up to 20 carbon atoms. More preferably each R represents an unsubstituted alkyl group having up to 6 carbon atoms. Acetic anhydride is an especially preferred feedstock, in which case the reaction products are ethylidene diacetate and acetic acid. Preferably the group VIII metal used as catalyst is selected from cobalt, nickel. rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium and platinum, with the use of palla dium and. especially, rhodium and nickel. being preferred.The metal may for example be added in the form of a salt with a mineral acid, for example a halide, nitrate or sulphate, or with an organic acid, for example a carboxylate having up to 20 carbon atoms, especially an alkanoate, such as an acetate. Alternatively, the metal may be in zero valent form complexed by ligands such as the phosphine ligands described below, carbon monoxide, or acetylacetonates. The catalyst must be homogeneous with the reaction medIum, and the presence of carbon monoxide is necessary in order to stabilize the catalyst in solution. The carbon monoxide is suitably provided in admixture with the hydrogen gas supplied to the system. The relative amounts of hydrogen and carbon monoxide supplied to the system may vaty over a very wide range.For example. a molar ratio H2 CO in the range 1 99 to 99 1 is suitable. with a molar ratio of 25 75 to 95 5 being preferred. The quantity of catalyst present in the system is generally determined by economic considerations. Quantities of catalyst of between 0.01 to 10, especially 0.05 to 5, mole based on the number of moles of anhydride used as feedstock. are generally suitable. The process according to the invention is carried out in the presence of a halide selected from chloride bromide or iodide. The use of a bromide o, especially an iodide, is preferred. The halide used is in addition to any halide which may be present in the catalyst or catalyst precursor. The halide is preferably added in the form of an alkyl halide, for example methyl iodide. an acyl halide. for example acetyl bromide. a hydrogen halide, elemental halogen, or a halide salt of an alkali or al saline earth metal, for example lithium or sodium iodde. The use of an alkyl halide is preferred. When using a symmetrical anhydride of formula RCO 20 as feedstock and an organic halide, it may be convenient in order to minimize the formation of mixed products, to select the organic halide having the formula R.Halide or R.CO.Halide. Thus for example when using acetic anhydride as feedstock, methyl todide or acetyl bromide are suitable halides, whereas when using propionic anhydride as feedstock. it may be more convenient to use ethyl iodide or propionyl bromide. The quantity of halide added may vary over a wide range, and generally, the rate of the reaction increases with the concentration of halide. For example. the halide may be present in an amount of up to 10 molar percent based on the numbed of moles of anhydride used as feedstock. Preferably, the molar ratio of added halide to metal catalyst is in the range of from 1 1 to 200 1. especially 5 1 to 50 1. the halide calcu1ated as halide ion and the catalyst calculated as atomic group VIII metal. These quantities of halide are of course in addition to any halide which may be present in the catalyst or catalyst precursor. As stated above, the hydrogen gas stream supplied to the system may contain carbon monoxide. It may also if desired contain inert gases, such as nitrogen. The reaction is suitably carried out under a pressure of from 10 to 150 bars, especially 20 to 100 bars. Higher ptes sures, for example up to 1000 bars, can of course be used, but are generally undesirable for economic reasons. The reaction temperature is suitably in the range of from 100 to 2000C. especially 130 to 1700C. The reaction is suitably carried out under substantially anhydrous conditions to prevent hydrolysis of the starting material and the product. However, the presence of the minor amounts of water normally found in the commercial forms of the components of the reaction mixture presents no problem. The process according to the invention is often conveniently carried out using excess carboxylic acid anhydride as solvent. However1 if desired. any suitab e additional solvent may be used. Suitable inert solvents include hydrocarbons, for example xylene or hexane, ethers.for example tetrahydrofuran, am des, for example dimethyl formamide, nitrides, fo example aceton4trile, and sulphur containing compounds, for example su1phorane. The use of solvents which are reactive under the reaction conditions is of course undesirable. Suitable promotors are organo oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic and antimony compounds having a lone pair of electrons. Preferred prorriotors are organo nitrogen or, especially, organo phosphorus compounds.especially tri organo phosphines. Suitable oxygen containina promoters include compounds containing a hydroxy, carbonyl, carbonyloxy or ether group. Typical compounds of this type include carboxylic acids. especially hydroxy or alkoxy substituted acids. such as methoxyacetlc acid or hydroxyacetic acid.ethers such as tetrahydrofuran. and amidst such as dimethylacetamide. Amides are of course an example of a promotor containing both nitrogen and oxygen atoms.It may be suitable to use an oxygen containing compound as a solvent which may also have a promoting effect. Suitable phosphorus, antimony and arsenic promoters include those of the general formula XR R R 1,. in which X represents phosphorus, antimony or arsenic, and each of R , R and R independently represents an optionally substituted alkyl. cycloalkyl or aryl group. orR has this meaning and R and R together represent an alkylene group. Optional substituents may be any moi eties inert under the reaction conditions, for example halogen atoms alkoxy groups and phenyl groups. Preferably however R , R and R are hydrocarbyl groups. Preferably any alkyl group has up to 20 carbon atoms any csycloalkyl group has up to 7 carbon atoms any aryl group is a phenyl group and any alkylene group has up to 20 carbon atoms. Especially preferred promotors of this type are those in which each of R , R and R independently represents an alkyl group or a phenyl group. For economic reasons.it is generally preferred that each of R . R and R represents the same group. Preferably X represents a phosphorus atom. Typical phosphine promotors are trimethylphosphine. triethylphosphine. tributylphosphine and triphenylphosphine. Suitable nitrogen containing promotors include those of the general formula NR P R whe e R , R and R have the meanings given above. and also compounds in which the nitrogen atom forms part of a heterocycllc ring. Typical promotors of this type include pyrrole. pyrrolidine, pyridine, piperidine, pyrimidine, picoline and quinoline, and substituted analogues thereof, e.g.alkyl substituted analogues. The amount of promotor used is not critical. Except in those cases where the promotor used may also be employed as a solvent. the ratio of promotor to catalyst is preferably in the range of from 1 1 to 20 1, especially 2 1 to 10 1, calculated as moles of promotor per gram atom of group VIII metal. In a preferred embodiment of the process according to the invention the carboxylic acid anhydride used as feedstock has been prepared in a separate reaction step by the carbonylation of an ester in the presence of a suitable catalyst. Suitable methods for carrying out this carbonylation are described for example in UK Patent Specifications 1523346 and 1468940. For example, the ester may be carbonylated in the presence of a rhodium containing catalyst together with a halide. Any of the halides described hereinabove for the hydrogenation of an anhydride, may be used, but pre ferably the halide is a bromide or iodide of an alkali metal. Lithium iodide is especially suitable. Surprisingly, it has been found that the rate of ca bonylation is much increased by the addition of small quantities of either water or carboxylic acid to the reaction mixture. Suitably. the molar ratio of water or carboxylic acid to halide is in the range of from 1 1 to 1.10, especially ly 1 1.5 to 1 5. The carboxylic acid added is preferably the acid or one of the acids corresponding to the anhydride being prepared, in order to avoid the products tion of undesired mixed products. If water is added, it may be added as such. or, in suitable cases, as water of crystallization of the halide the commecial forms of lithium iodide contain from 2 to 3 moles of water of crystallization per mole of Lii, and this quantity of water is adequate to enhance the rate of the carbonylation reaction. It has also been found that when using metal halides as promotors in the carbonylation reaction, the rate of reaction can be increased by the addition of a suitable crown ether capable of complexing the metal ion. Thus for example when using sodium iodide as the halide, the addition of 15 crown 5 increases the rate of the reaction.When the reaction mixture contains both a crown ether and water or a carboxylic acid, the promoting effect is particularly marked. The carbonylation reaction is suitably carried out at a temperature in the range of from 130 to 2200C, especially 160 to 2000C. Generally. the optimum tempe ature for carbonylation for an ester is somewhat higher than the optimum temperature for hydrogenation of the anhydride thus produced. The ester carbonylation reaction is preferably carried out using a carbon monoxide gas stream which does not contain large quantities of hydrogen, although quantities of hydrogen of for example up to about 15 by volume of the gas stream, can be tolerated above this level, the production of by products tends to increase. A stream of carbon monoxide free from zaire quantity ties of hydrogen can be obtained by carrying out the hydrogenation process according to the invention using a mixed carbon monoxide hydrogen stream, i.e. a synthesis gas stream , suitably maintaining the initial charge of carboxylic acid anhydride in excess of that required to react with the hydrogen. The resulting carbon monoxide can then be recycled to the ester ca bonylation step, to produce a further charge of anhydride. This two step process fo the co production of an a . kyli dene dicarboxylate and a carboxylic acid from an ester is gdeally suited to the utilization of industrial synthesis gases containing carbon monoxide and hydrogen in a molar ratio of 2 1. The anhydride product of the carbonylation step may if desired be separated from the other components of the reaction mixture from that step before being hydrogenated by the process according to the invention.Conventional techniques such as distillation may be used. However1 complete separation is not essential.For example, amounts of ester in the anhydride feedstock for the process according to the invention, of up to about 1 mole of ester per mole of anhydride.may be tolerated if desired. However, it is preferred that the feed stock should be free from substantial amounts of ester, for example greater then 10 molar percent in order to avoid the formation of by products and inhibition of the hydrogenation of the anhydride. The ester to be carbonylated may be prepared by any suitable method, typically by esterification of an acid with an alcohol by known methods. The acid may be the same acid as is co produced along with a dicarboxylate, in the process according to the invention. thus effectively recycling this acid. Alternatively. the ester may be prepared in situ by the carbonylation of an ether or alcohol using known techniques. The alkylidene dicarboxylate produced by the process according to the invention may be converted into a number of other valuable products by known methods. for example into olefinic esters. or into aldehydes. For example, ethylidene diacetate, which is the preferred compound produced by the Process according to the invention, can be converted into either vinyl acetate or acetaldehyde by well known methods. Thus for example in an integrated reaction scheme.methanol. carbon monoxide and hydrogen can be converted into vinyl acetate EMI11.1 Alternatively, the ethylidene acetate can be converted into acetaldehyde EMI11.2 and the overall reaction becomes EMI11.3 The following Examples illustrate the invention.Examples 1 to 9 All these examples were carried out using the same technique. A Hastelloy C Trade Mark 300 ml magnet driven autoclave was charged with 50 mls acetic anhydride and the necessary catalyst components. flushed with carbon monoxide. and then pressurized to 40 bars with a 1 1 molar mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The autoclave was then maintained at the desired temperature for 15 hours. The contents were cooled and analysed using gas liquid chromatography. The results obtained are given in Table 1.
