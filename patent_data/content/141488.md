# Hosiery display board.

## Abstract
A plurality of packages of socks S is displayed on elongate hanger elements 15 by the present display board 10 . A sock package retaining rail 20 is connected at opposite ends to opposite side portions of the display board 10 and the medial portion extends across and confines the sock packages S within the retaining rail 20 . The sock package retaining rail 20 is wide enough to support an advertising card 45 thereon, is narrow enough that the upper and lower portions of the sock packages S are exposed to view by prospective purchasers, and confines the sock packages S and protects the same from being dislodged or accidentally removed from the hanger elements 15 . The display board 10 is fabricated in such a manner that it may be economically shipped in a knock down condition and can be quickly and easily assembled at the location where it is to be used.
