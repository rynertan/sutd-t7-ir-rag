# A NON WOVEN FABRIC, A BITUMINOUS WATER PROOFING MEMBRANE BUILT UP ON IT, AND THE USE OF THE FABRIC AS A CARCASS IN SUCH A MEMBRANE

## Abstract
A non woven fabric for use as a bitumen coated and possibly bitumen impregnated carcass in a water proofing membrane, particularly for roofs, is distinguished in that a proportion of at least 75 by weight of the fabric fibers com prise organic synthetic fibers, preferably polyester fibers, and cellulose fibers, preferably wood pulp fibers, the organic synthetic fibers constituting at least 10 and at most 90 by weight of this fiber proportion. The non woven fabric is coated with a binder compatible with bitumen in an amount of a least 10 , preferably at least 20 of the fabric weight, the binder being selected so as to be thermally stable up to a temperature of at least 160 C and for limiting the water transport ability of at least the cellulose fibers. The invention also includes water proofing membranes including a car cass formed by such fabric, which is coated and possibly impregnated with bitumen. The invention also includes the use of such a non woven fabric as the carcass in such a water proofing membrane.
