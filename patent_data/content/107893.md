# RETRO FOCUS TYPE WIDE ANGLE LENS

## Abstract
A retro focus type wide angle lens having in succession from an object side a first negative meniscus lens 1 having its convex surface facing the object side, a second positive lens 2 , a third biconvex lens 3 , a fourth negative doublet 4 consisting of a biconvex lens and a biconcave lens, a fifth positive lens 5 , and a sixth positive lens 6 is disclosed. The lenses satisfy the conditions 1.3f f₁ 2f d₂ d₃ d₄ 2f v₂ 40 1.2 r₇ r₉ 2 where f, represents the focal length of said first lens component d₂, d₃, and d₄ represent the thickness of and distance between said first, second and third lens compo nents, v₂ represents an Abbe number of said second lens component, and r₇ and r₉ represent curvature radii of lens surfaces of said fourth lens component. Although this retro focus type wide angle lens is formed of six lens groups and seven lens components, its field angle or angle of view is about 66 degrees, its aperture ratio is 1 1.6, its total length is very short, the aperture of its first divergent lens group is very small and its various aberrations are satisfactorily compensated for.
