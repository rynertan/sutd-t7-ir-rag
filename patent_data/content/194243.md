# DEVICE FOR DETECTING OBJECTS, PARTICULARLY SUCH IN MOTION

## Abstract
The invention comprises a pulse transmitter 2, 3 for infra red light, the reflected radiation from which is received by photo diodes 5 converting the light pulses to electric pulses, which are amplified 9 and applied to a balancing circuit 12 , which operates digitally and with a given working or threshold level. Applied pulses give the output of the balancing circuit 12 a low state, which is sup plied to a first integration circuit 16 having relatively rapid integration time, and which is in series with a second integra tion circuit 18 . The integration circuits each control an input 21, 26 of a comparison circuit 22 , which generates an operation signal on its output 27, 28 when there is a dif ference in integration conditions, the slower integration cir cult 18 controlling the working or threshold level of the balancing circuit 12 .
