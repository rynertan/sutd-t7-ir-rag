There is further provided a first transmission means to provide a permanent kinematic connec tion between the motor and the pedal axle of the vehicle for the moving thereoft when operating in the first mode and a second transmission means to selectively provide a kinematic connec tion between one wheel of the vehicle and the motor, to enable the motor to operate in the second mode.
