# Emulsion explosives composition.

## Abstract
An emulsion explosive composition comprising a dis continuous phase containing an oxygen supplying compo nent and an organic medium forming a continuous phase wherein the oxygen supplying component and organic medium are capable of forming an emulsion which, in the absence of a supplementary adjuvant, exhibits an electrical conductivity measured at 60 C, not exceeding 60,000 picomhos metre. Such conductivity may be achieved by inclusion of a modifier. The compositions exhibit improved storage characteristics.
