# Antimicrobial non woven fabric.

## Abstract
An antimicrobial agent is incorporated into the binder of a non woven fabric where it resides in colloidal suspension within the amorphous zones of the polymer. Thus incorpo rated it migrates to the surface of the binder and onto the fibers of the non woven fabric to inhibit the growth of bacteria and fungi.
