# Process for distillation of styrenes.

## Abstract
The present invention provides a process for distillation of styrene compositions comprising styrenes and ethylbenzenes to separate said styrenes and said ethylbenzenes which can be stably oprated with improved energy consumption. The process comprises a feeding said styrene composition into a middle portion of a distillation column 2 of packed column type operated under a reduced pressure b withdrawing from the top of said distillation column 2 vapor of low boiling point components mainly composed of ethylbenzenes and withdrawing from the bottom of the column 2 liquid of high boiling point components mainly composed of styrenes c leading at least a part of said vapor of low boiling point components to a compressor 7 to elevate the temperature thereof by adiabatic compression d introducing the compressed vapor to a reboiler 13 of said distillation column wherein at least part of said vapor is con densed and the latent heat thereby released is used as a heat source of said reboiler e returning at least part of the condensed low boiling point components from said reboiler, optionally together with a part of the uncondensed vapor, into said distillation column and f withdrawing the remaining said low boiling components from the distillation system.
