# Apparatus for obtaining image information through use of a nuclear magnetic resonance signal.

## Abstract
A static magnetic field and a gradient magnetic field which is of the same direction as the former but the intensity of which is graded in three intersecting directions are applied to an examinee s body 47 so that space information therefrom can be discriminated. High frequency pulses are applied by a solenoid coil 43 and or a surface coil 49 to the examinee s body 47 and a nuclear magnetic resonance signal therefrom is received to obtain the spatial distribution of information contained in the received signal. A static field generating means 34a, 34b, 34c is constructed so that the static magnetic field is directed horizontal and the ex aminee s body is brought into and out of the static magnetic field perpendicularly thereto from the horizontal direction. The axis of the solenoid coil 43 crosses the static magnetic field perpendicularly thereto and is held horizontal, and the examinee s body can be positioned in the solenoid coil. The surface coil whose RF direction is vertical is disposed in adjacent relation to a target region of the examinee s body so that the nuclear magnetic resonance signal can also be received by the surface coil.
