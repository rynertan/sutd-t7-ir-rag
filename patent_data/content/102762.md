# METHOD OF PERFORMING A CHEMICAL REACTION

## Abstract
A streamline flow of aqueous cobalt II sulphate solu tion passes through a platimum tube which, as an anode, electrolyses the solution to cobalt III . The flow, with a high surface concentration of nascent cobalt III , falls into a volume of 1 methylnaphthalene in an organic solvent, and is recovered from underneath for recycling to the platinum tube anode. The cobalt III reacts with the 1 methylnapthalene to form 1 naphthaldehyde. Other oxidations of organic reac tants using nascent high oxidation state aqueous metal ions are also disclosed.
