## Description
SPECIFICATION TITLE OF THE INVENTION PROCESS FOR PRODUCING AROMATIC MONOCARBOXYLIC ACIDBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION FIELD OF THE INVENTION The presetit invention relates to a process for producing an aromatic monocarboxylic acid by oxidizing a benzene derivative having an alkyl group. More particularly, it relates to a process for producing an aromatic monocarboxylic acid by oxidizing a benzene derivative having one alkyl group or an alkyl group and an inert substituent such as a halogen atom, nitro, carboxymethyl, and methoxy group, in a liquid phase, with niolecular oxygen or a molecular oxygen containing gas in the presence of a heavy metal compound catalyst. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ARTS Heretofore, it has been known that aromatic monocarboxylic acids of aromatic compounds having one carboxylic acid group can be produced by oxidizing a benzene derivative having one alkyl group with molecular oxygen or a molecular oxygen containing gas in the presence of an oil soluble metal salt catalyst without any solvent. However, in the conventional process reacting in the absence of a solvent, it is necessary to give a low conversion of the benzene derivative as the starting material in order to increase a selectivity to the object aromatic monocarboxylic acid. When a conversion of benzene derivative as the starting material is increased, the selectivity to the object aromatic monocarboxylic acid is remarkably decreased to form a large amount of by products such as coloring materials disadvantageously. When an oxidation in liquid phase is carried out in the absence of a solvent, the reaction is performed in a radical chain reaction whereby an absorption of oxygen is not found at the initial stage, but the severe reaction is suddaly caused at the initiation of absorption of oxygen to increase the ratio of binding radicals to each other and to increase a formation of the by products such as coloring materials. It has been also known that an aromatic monocarboxylic acid is produced by oxidizing a benzene derivative as the starting material in liquid phase with molecular oxygen or molecular oxygencontaining gas in the presence of a metal catalyst in a large amount of a solvent such as two or more times by weight of a solvent. Thus, in the process using a solvent, the conversion of the benzene derivative as the starting material and the selectivity to the aromatic monocarboxylic acid as the object compound can be relatively increased. However, a solubility of the aromatic monocarboxylic acid as the object compound to the solvent is relatively high whereby it is difficult to recover the object aromatic monocarboxylic acid in high yield from the solvent and the yield of the object aromatic monocarboxylic acid is disadvantageously low. The process using the solvent is not an economical process from the viewpoint of the low yield of the object aromatic monocarboxylic acid as well as the cost for recovering the solvent and the loss of the solvent. A process for oxidizing o bromo or o chlorotoluene in liquid phase with oxygen in acetic acid solvent in tl Q presence of a catalyst of cobalt acetate and hydrogen bromide at 900C for 2 hours has been disclosed in Canadian Journal of Chemistry 43, 1306 to 1317 1965 . In this process, relatively large amounts of the solvent and the catalyst are used and the selectivity to the object aromatic monocarboxylic acid is low to be disadvantageous as an industrial process. The inventors have studied to overcome the disadvantages of the conventional process and to provide the economical process for producing an aromatic monocarboxylic acid having high quality in high yield. As the result, the inventors have found that an aromatic monocarboxylic acid having high quality can be economically produced in high yield by oxidizing a benzene derivative having one alkyl group in liquid phase at a specific temperature under incorporating a specific small amount of a lower aliphatic monocarboxylic acid in the reaction system under reacting them smoothly in high conversion and high selectivity. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for producing an aromatic monocarboxylic acid having high quality in high yield under a smooth reaction to give high conversion of a benzene derivative having an alkyl group and high selectivity to the object aromatic monocarboxylic acid. The foregoing and other objects of the present invention have been attained by providing a process for oxidizing a benzene derivative having an alkyl group in a liquid phase with molecular oxygen or a molecular oxygen containing gas in the presence of a heavy metal compound catalyst at a specific temperature from the temperature maintaining the object aromatic monocarboxylic acid in liquid to 2300C under incorporating 0. 05 to 2 times preferably less than 0.8 times by weight of a lower aliphatic monocarboxylic acid to said benzene derivative.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS In spite of the condition reacting under incorporating only a small amount of a lower aliphatic monocarboxylic acid such as 0. 05 to 0. 8 times by weight of a lower aliphatic monocarboxylic acid to the benzene derivative as the starting material, which is the reaction system containing substantially no solvent, that is, similar to the conventional liquid phase oxidation system containing no solvent, the reaction can be smoothly performed to give high conversion and high selectivity to obtain the aromatic monocarboxylic acid having high quality in high yield. This is an unexpected phenomenon. Thus, the present invention is to provide an improved process for the liquid phase oxidation of the benzene derivative it a non solvent system. The process of the present invention will be described in detail. The lower aliphati monocarboxylic acids inco, porated in the reaction system of the process of the present invention include acetic acid,propionic acid and butyric acid and acetic acid is preferably used. An amount of the lower aliphatic monocarboxylic acid iS 0.05 to 0.8 times preferably 0.15 to 0. 5 times by weight based on the benzene derivative as the starting material. When the amount of the lower aliphatic monocarboxylic acid is less than 0. 05 times by weight based on the benzene derivative as the starting material, the oxidation is not easily initiated and severe oxidation is suddenly performed after the initiation to produce various by products such as coloring materials whereby the selectivity to the object aromatic monocarboxylic acid is too low and the purpose of the present invention is not attained. On the other hand, when the amount of the lower aliphatic carboxylic acid is greater than 0.8 times by weight based on the benzene derivative, the reaction velocity is too slow and the content of the intermediates in the reaction system is increased to reduce the purity of the object aromatic monocarboxylic acid. Moreover, a cost for recovering the lower aliphatic monocarboxylic acid and a loss of the same used in the reaction system are increased and the purpose of the present invention is not attained. Effects of the amount of the lower aliphatic monocarboxylic acid to the conversion of the benzene derivative as the starting material, the selectivity to the object aromatic monocarboxylic acid and the selectivity to the aldehyde as the by product are shown in a graph ofFigure 1. When the amount of the lower aliphatic monocarboxylic acid is higher or lower than the above defined range, the conversion of the benzene derivative as the starting material and the selectivity to the object aromatic monocarboxylic acid are low whereas the selectivity to the aldehyde as the by product is high, disadvantageously. In Figure 1, the conversion and the selectivities in the reactions under the condition of the following Example except varying the amount of the lower aliphatic monocarboxylic acid,are shown. In Figure 1, the full line shows the conversion of the benzene derivative as the starting material, the dotted line shows the selectivity to the object aromatic monocarboxylic acid and the dotted chain line shows the selectivity to the aldehyde. In order to attain the purpose of the present invention, it is important to incorporate the lower aliphatic monocarboxylic acid in said range. Suitable benzene derivatives having one alkyl group include alkylbenzenes such as toluene, ethylbenzene, n propylbenzene and i propylbenzene substituted alkylbenzenes having one or more inert substituent such as halogen atoms, nitro group, carboxymethyl group and methoxy group on the benzene ring such as alkyl halobenzenes e.g. o , m or p chlorotoluene and o ,m or p bromotoluene alkyl nitrobenzenes e.g. o , m or p nitrotoluene alkyl carboxymethylbenzenes such as o , m or p carboxymethyltoluene and alkyl methoxybenzenes e.g. o , m or p methoxytoluene. The heavy metal compound catalysts used in the present invention are preferably catalysts having heavy metal components of cobalt and or manganese as main components or catalysts having heavy metal components of cobalt and or manganese main components with a second or third additional component of nickel or cerium Tlie catalyst of the heavy metal compound is preferably in a form of an aliphatic carboxylic acid salt or a halide which is soluble in the lower aliphatic monocarboxylic acid. In the reaction system, it is possible to incorporate a reaction accelerator such as halogens, aldehydes and ketones. When bromine is incorporated as the reaction accelerator, superior results may be attained. The incorporation of bromine is preferable. An amount of the catalyst is usually more than 0. 005 wt. preferably 0. 03 to 2 wt. especially 0. 05 to 0. 5 wt. as a metal component based on the benzene derivative as the starting material. Superior result may be attained by using a combination of cobalt and manganese components in comparison with the use of only cobalt or manganese component. It is especially preferable to combine them at a ratio of Mn Co of 0. 5 to 500 wt. Sv. A total amount of the reaction accelerator such as halogens, aldehydes and ketones is preferably in a range of 0. 05 to 30 wt. based on the benzene derivative as the starting material. An amount of halogen compound is preferably in a range of 0. 05 to 5. 0 especially 0.1 to 1. 0 wt. as halogen component based on the benzene derivative as the starting material. The effect of the present invention can be further improved by selecting tlie kinds and the amounts of the catalytic component and the reaction accelerator. In the process of the present invention, the reaction is performed under incorporating the benzene dermis Llve as the starting material, the heavy metal compound catalyst, if necessary, with the reaction accelerator, the lower aliphatic monocarboxylic acid and molecular oxygen or molecular oxygen containing gas in the reaction system. It is necessary to perform the reaction at the temperature higher than the temperature for maintaining the resulting aromatic monocarboxylic acid in liquid form in the reaction system, preferably higher than a melting point of the resultin aromatic mon. carbox lic acid. When the reaction temperature is lower than the temperature for maintaining the resulting aromatic monocarboxylic acid in liquid form, that is the temperature for solidifying a part of the resulting aromatic monocarboxylic acid, homogeneous react n can not be performed to increase side reactions and to reduce the yield of the object aromatic monocarboxylic acid. In general, the minimum temperature for maintaining the aromatic monocarboxylic acid in liquid form is slightly lowed than the melting point of the resulting aromatic monocarboxylic acid when the amount of the lower aliphatic monocarboxylic acid is lower limit in the defined range whereas it is about 400C lower than the melting point of the resulting aromatic monocarboxylic acid when the amount of the lower aliphatic monocarboxylic acid is upper limit in the defined range. When the reaction temperature is higher than 2300C, the amount of the by products is too much and the yield of the object aromatic monocarboxylic acid is low. Accordingly, the reaction temperature should be lower than 2300 C. Accordingly, the reaction temperature should be in the range from the temperature for maintaining the resulting aromatic monocarboxylic acid in liquid form to 2300C preferably 80 to 2200C. In the process of the present invention, the reaction pressure can be a sum of the pressure for maintaining the reaction system in liquid form and a partial pressure of molecular oxygen or molecular oxygen containing gas. The partial pressure of molecular oxygen or molecular oxygen containing gas is preferably in a range of 1 to 30 atm.especially 5 to 20 atm. When the partial pressure of molecular oxygen or molecular oxygen containing gas is too low, the reaction is too slow and the side reaction is easily caused. On the other hand, there is no advantageous effect for the reaction velocity and the quality of the resulting aron , rtic monocar.oxylic acid even though the partial pressure is increased over 30 atm. The molecular oxygen or molecular oxygen containing gas fed in the reaction system is preferably air as it is economical. In the feeding of the molecular oxygen or molecular oxygencontaining gas into the reaction system, it is preferable to control the concentration of oxygen in the waste gas discharged from the reaction system in a non explosive range. When chlorotoluene is oxidzed to obtain chlorobenzoic acid, the catalyst comprising 0. 025 to 0. 5 wt. preferably 0. 04 to 0. 3 wt. as Co of cobalt component based on the lower aliphatic monocarboxylic acid, 0. 5 to 250 wt. preferably 1 to 150 wt. as Mn of manganese component based on cobalt component and 0. 07 to 3 wt. preferably 0. 1 0 to 1. 0 wt. as Br of bromine component based on the lower aliphatic monocarboxylic acid is preferably used to prevent a disconnection of chlorine atom so as to produce benzoic acid instead of chlorobenzoic acid. The bromine component can be also inorganic or organic bromine compounds such as sodium bromide, ammoniurri bromide, methyl bromide and bromoform which is soluble in the lower aliphatic monocarboxylic acid. When chlorotoluene is oxidized to obtain chlorobenzoic acid, the amount of the lower aliphatic monocarboxylic acid can be increased to less than 2 times preferably less than0imes by weight based on ciilorotoluene and the reaction is performed at 80 to 2200C preferably 120 to 1800C under a pressure of 3 to 30 atm. The bromine component is preferably hydrogen bromide, cobalt bromide or manganese bromide which is the catalyst itself or a combinatiol. of hydrogen. The reaction time is preferably 2 to 8 hours to obtain the object aromatic monocarboxylic acid having high quality in high yield. The reaction can be performed in a batch system, a semicontinuous system or a continuous system. The lower aliphatic monocarboxylic acid and the catalyst components are separated from the reaction mixture by the conventional or other suitable methods to obtain the object aromatic monocarboxylic acid. For example, the reaction mixture is cooled and the solid component is separated and the solid component is washed and dried.The reaction mixture is fed to a distillator and light components such as the lower aliphatic monocarboxylic acid are distilled off as an initial fraction and the solid components such as the catalyst and high boiling components are discharged from a bottom of a reactor as the bottom residue and the object aromatic monocarboxylic acid is distilled as the middle fraction to obtain the object aromatic monocarboxylic acids having high purity from the reaction mixture. In accordance with the process of the present invention, the object aromatic monocarboxylic acid is obtained in high conversion and high selectivity and the amount of the by products contained in the reaction mixture after the reaction is small whereby the object aromatic monocarboxylic acid having high quality can be easily obtained from the reaction mixture by a simple operation such as distillation.The operation for obtaining the object aromatic monocarboxylic acid from the reaction mixture can be simiplified in comparison with the conventional process. In accordance with the process of the present invention, the object aromatic monocarboxylic acid can be produced in high conversion and high selectivity even though the reaction condition is relatively mild. Accordingly, the process can be advantageously applied to the oxidation of an alkylbenzene having a substituent which is easily disconnected under severe reaction condition. The present invention will be further illustrated by certain examples and references which are provided for the purpose of illustration only. In the examples and references, the benzene derivatives as the starting material had each purity of greater than 99 and the contents of components in the reaction mixture were determined by a gas chromatography. From the contents of the components in the reaction mixture, conversions of the benzene derivative as the starting material, selectivities to the object aromatic monocarboxylic acid and yields thereof and selectivities to the aldehyde are calculated. The reaction products beside the object aromatic monocarboxylic acid and the aldehyde are considered as the other intermediates and by products. 1 Conversion of benzene derivative as the starting material mole 1 unreacted benzene derivative x 100 charged benzene derivative 2 Selectivity to object aromatic monocarboxylic acid mole EMI11.1 tb moles SEP of SEP aromatic SEP monocarboxylic SEP acid tb moles SEP of SEP charged SEP SEP SEP moles SEP of SEP unreacted SEP x SEP 100 SEP tb benzene SEP derivative SEP benzene SEP derivative tb 3 Selectivity to aldehyde mole EMI12.1 tb moles SEP of SEP aldehyde SEP x SEP 100 tb SEP mole SEP of SEP charged SEP SEP SEP mole SEP of SEP unreacted tb SEP benzene SEP derivative SEP benzene SEP derivative tb 4 Yield of aromatic monocarboxylic acid mole conversion of selectivity to aromatic benzene derivative monocarboxylic acid 100 Example 1 In a reactor made of titanium equipped with a reflux condenser, a stirrer, a gas inlet and a gas outlet, 700 g of o chlorotoluene 140 g of acetic acid, 3.9 g of cobalt bromide 0.1 wt. as Co to o chorolotoluene , 0.06 g of manganese acetate 2 wt. 50 as Mn to cobalt component were charged and thoroughly stirred.
