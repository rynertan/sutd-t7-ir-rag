## Description
ETHER HERBICIDES This invention relates to certain oximino diphenyl ether derivatives, the preparation of such compounds, herbicidal ccmpositions containing them, and to their use in combating undesired plant growth. Certain diphenyl ethers are known to be effective herbicides for example UK Patent Application No. 2049695 describes diphenyl ether alkanoic acids and their use as herbicides. It has now been found that useful herbicidal activity is present in diphenyl ethers bearing an oxiinino substituent. Accordingly, the present invention provides oximino diphenyl ether derivatives having the general formula I EMI1.1 wherein R1 represents a halogen, preferably chlorine, atcm or a haloalkyl group R2 and R3, which may be the same or different, each independently represents a hydrogen or halogen, preferably chlorine, atan or a nitro, cyano or haloalkyl group X represents a cyano or triazole group or a group 4 or NR5R6 in which R4 represents an optionally substituted alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, alkoxycarbonylalkyl or acyl group R5 represents an optionally substituted alkyl or aralkyl group and R6 represents an optionally substituted alkyl, aralkyl or alkoxy group, or the groups R5 and R6 together jointly represent an alkylene group and Z represents a hydrogen atan or an optionally substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, aralkyl, alkoxycarbonylalkyl or acyl group. When any of the above substituents represents or contains an alkyl or haloalkyl group, this suitably contains up to 6, preferably up to 4, carbon atans, and the halogen atom in the haloalkyl group is suitably fluorine or chlorine, with trifluoromethyl being the preferred haloalkyl group. When any of the substituents represent or contain an aryl group, this is preferably a phenyl group, which may optionally be substituted. the the aforesaid groups are optionally substituted, suitable substituents include a halogen, especially chlorine, atohn and a cyano group. When R5 and 6 together represent an alkylene group, this may be straight or branched chain, and preferably contains from 3 to 8, especially 4 or 5, carbon atoms. When either of X or Z represents an acyl group, this may be derived from any organic acid, e.g. a carboxylic, sulphonic, phosphDnic or carbamic acid. Preferred compounds are those in which RI represents a haloalkyl, especially trifluoromethyl, group R2 represents a halogen, especially chlorine, atom and RI represents a hydrogen atom. X preferably represents a cyano or triazole group or the group SR4 wherein R4 is an alkyl group containing up to 4 carbon atoms, especially methyl, a phenyl group, or an alkanoyl or alkoxycarbonylalkyl group of up to 8 carbon arans, especially acetyl or ethoxycarbonylmethyl, or a group NRIRI wherein RI and RI each represents an alkyl group containing up to 4 carbon atoms, especially methyl, or R5 and R6 jointly represent an alkylene group containing fran 3 to 8 carbon atoms, especially a terra or penta methylene group. Z preferably represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group containing up to 4 carbon atoms, especially methyl, optionally substituted by a cyano or phenyl group, an alkanoyl, alkylcarbamoyl or alkylsulphonyl group of up to 6 carbon atoms, especially acetyl, methylcarbamoyl or methylsulphonyl, or an alkoxycarbonylalkyl group of up to 8 carbon atans, especially methoxycarbonylmethyl. The invention also provides a process for the preparation of ethers as defined above, which comprises reacting a halo aldoxime of formula II EMI3.1 with a compound of formula XH, wherein R1, R2, R3, X and Z are as defined above and Hal is halogen, in the presence of a base.A suitable base is a trialkylamine, such as triethylamine, and and the reaction is preferably carried out in an organic solvent such as ether. The reaction can conveniently be carried out at ambient temperature 250C . When X represents SR4 or NR5R6, then Z is preferably a hydrogen atom. The product of this reaction is then an oxide compound of formula I wherein Z is a hydrogen atom when other derivatives of formula I are required, these may be obtained by further reacting said oxide with a compound of formula Hal Z wherein Z is other than hydrogen in the presence of an alkali metal hydride such as sodium hydride.This further reaction is preferably carried out in a polar organic solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran, and can conveniently be effected under reflux. The compounds of general formula I have been found to show interesting activity as herbicides. Accordingly, the invention further provides a herbicidal composition comprising a compound of foiniula I as defined above in association with at least one carrier, and a method of making such a composition which compr Lses bringing a compound of formula I into association with at least one carrier. The invention also provides the use of such a compound or canpos ition according to the invention as a herbicide. Further, in accordance with the invention there is provided a method of combating undesired plant growth at a locus by treating the locus with a compound or composition according to the invention.Application to the locus may be pre emergence or post emergence. The dosage of active ingredient used may, for example, be from 0.05 to 4kg ha. A carrier in a composition according to the invention is any material with which the active ingredient is formalated to facilitate application to the locus to be treated, which may for example be a plant, seed or soil, or to facilitate storage, transport or handling. A carrier may be a solid or a liquid, including a material which is normally gaseous but which has been compressed to form a liquid, and any of the carriers normally used in formulating herbicidal compositions may be used. Preferably compositions according to the invention contain 0.5 to 95 by weight of active ingredient. Suitable solid carriers include natural and synthetic clays and silicates, for example natural silicas such as diatanaceous earths magnesium silicates, for example talcs magnesium aluminium silicates, for example attapulgites and vermiculites aluminium silicates, for example kaolinites, montomorillonites and micas calcium carbonate calcium sulphate airrrnium sulphate synthetic hydrated silicon oxides and synthetic calcium or aluminium silicates elements, for example carban and sulphur natural and synthetic resins, for example couarone resins, polyvinyl chloride, and styrene polymers and copolymers solid polychlorophenols bitumen waxes and solid fertilisers, for example superphosphates. Suitable liquid carriers include water alcohols, for example isopropanol and glycols ketones, for example a acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone and cyclohexanone ethers arctic or araliphatic hydrocarbons, for example benzene, toluene and xylene petroleum fractions, for example kerosine and light mineral oils chlorinated hydrocarbons, for example carbon tetrachloride, perchloroethylene and trichloro ethane. Mixtures of different liquids are often suitable. Agricultural compositions are often formulated and transported in a concentrated form which is subsequently diluted by the user before application. The presence of small amounts of a carrier which is a surface active agent facilitates this process of dilution. Thus preferably at least one carrier in a composition according to the invention is a surface active agent. For example the composition may contain at least two carriers, at least one of which is a surface active agent. A surface active agent may be an emulsifying agent, a dispersing agent or a wetting agent it may be nonionic or ionic. Examples of suitable surface active agents include the sodium or calcium salts of polyacrylic acids and lignin sulphuric acids the condensation of fatty acids or aliphatic amines or amides containing at least 12 carbon atoms in the molecule with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide fatty acid esters of glycerol, sorbitan sucrose or pentaerythritol condensates of these with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide condensation products of fatty alcohol or alkyl phenols, for example E octylphenol or p octylcresol, with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide sulphates or sulphonates of these condensation products alkali or alkaline earth metal salts, preferably sodium salts, of sulphuric or sulphonic acid esters containing at least 10 carbon atoms in the molecule, for example sodium lauryl sulphate, sodium secondary alkyl sulphates, sodium salts of sulphonated castor oil, and sodium alkylaryl sulphonates such as dodecylbenzene sulphonate and polymers of ethylene oxide and copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. The compositions of the invention may for example be formulated as wettable powders, dusts, granules, solutions, emulsifiable concentrates, emulsions, suspension concentrates and aerosols. Wettable powders usually contain 25, 50 or 75 w of active ingredient and usually contain in addition to solid inert carrier, 3 10 w of a dispersing agent and, where necessary, 0 lOt w of stabiliser s and or other additives such as penetrants or stickers. Dusts are usually formulated as a dust concentrate having a similar composition to that of a wettable powder but without a dispersant, and are diluted in the field with further solid carrier to give a composition usually containing 1 2 10 w of active ingredient.Granules are usually prepared to have a size between 10 and 100 BS mesh 1.676 0.152 mm , and may be manufactured by agglomeration or impregnation techniques. Generally, granules will contain h 75 w active ingredient and 0 10 w of additives such as stabilisers, surfactants, slow release modifiers and binding agents. The so called dry flowable powders consist of relatively small granules having a relatively high concentration of active ingredient. Emulsifiable concentrates usually contain, in addition to a solvent and, when necessary, oo solvent, 10 50 w v active ingredient, 2 20 w v emulsifiers and 0 20 w v of other additives such as stabilisers, penetrants and corrosion inhibitors.Suspension conentrates are usually compounded so as to obtain a stable, non sedimenting flawable product and usually contain 10 75 w active ingredient, 0.515 w of dispersing agents, 0.1 10 w of suspending agents such as protective colloids and thixotropic agents, 0 10 w of other additives such as defoamars, corrosion inhibitors, stabilisers, penetrants and stickers, and water or an organic liquid in which the active ingredient is substantially insoluble certain organic solids or inorganic salts may be present dissolved in the formulation to assist in preventing sedimentation or as anti freeze agents for water. Aqueous dispersions and emulsions, for example compositions drained by diluting a wettable powder or a concentrate according to the invention with water, also lie within the scope of the invention. The said emuisions may be of the water in oil or of the oil in water type, and may have a thick mayonnaise like consistency. The composition of the invention may also contain other ingredients, for example other compounds possessing herbicidal, incecticidal 1 or fungicidal properties.

The tests fall into two categories, pre mergence and post emergence. The pre emergence tests involved spraying a liquid formulation of the ccopound onto the soil in which the seeds of the plant specied mentioned above had recently been sown. The post enerEence tests involved two types of test, viz., soil drench and foliar spray tests. In the soil drench tests the soil in which the seedling plants of the above species were growing was drenched with a liquid fonmulation containing a compound of the invention, and in the foliar spray tests the seedling plants were sprayed with such a formulation. The soil used in the tests was a prepared horticultural loam. The e formulations used in the tests were prepared fran solutions of the test compounds in acetone containing 0.4 by weight of an alkylphenol ethylene oxide condensate available under the trade mark TRITON X 155. These acetone solutions were diluted with water and the resulting formulations applied at dosage levels correpanding to 5 kg or 1 kg of active material per hectare in a volume equivalent to 600 litres per hectare in the soil spray and foliar spray test, and at a dosage of level equivalent to 10 kilograms of active material per hectare in a volume equivalent to approximately 3,000 litres per hectare in the soil drench tests. In the pre emergence tests untreated sown soil and in the post emergence tests untreated soil bearing seedling plants were used as controls. The herbicidal effects of the test compounds were assessed visually twelve days after spraying the foliage and the soil, and thirteen days after drenching the soil and were recorded on a 0 9 scale. A rating 0 indicates growth as untreated control, a rating 9 indicates death. An increase of 1 unit on the linear scale approxImates to a 10 increase in the level of effect. The results of the tests are set out in Table II below, in which the compounds are identified by reference to the preceding examples.
