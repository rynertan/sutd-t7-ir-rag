# SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ELECTRICAL POWER INSTALLATION

## Abstract
A flat multiconductor cable power distribution system has a discrete wire multi phase feeder, a main flat cable having at least four conductors, the cable being connected to the feeder to have plural phase energization. An insulation piercing adapt er overlies and is connected to the main cable and is energized with a selective one of the plural phases. In a particular arrange ment, a secondary multiconductor cable is connected to the main cable by the adapter. A power outlet may be electrically connected to the secondary cable at the juncture of the main and secondary cables and the adapter.
