# NOVEL BASIC POLYPEPTIDES AND A METHOD OF PRODUCING THEREOF

## Abstract
A novel basic polypeptide having an immune interferon like activity consists of 131 or 132 amino acid residues and has an apparent molecular weight of about 16,000 as measured by SDS electrophresis and of about 17,000 as measured by the high performance liquid chromatographic molecular sieve method an isoelectric point PI value in the range of 9.2 10.0 a cystein or methionine residue as the amino terminal a lysine residue as the carboxy terminal and the amino acid composition Asx 20, Thr 5, Ser 9, Glx 16, Pro 2, Gly 4, Ala 7, Cys 2, Val 8, Met 3 or 4, Ile 7, Leu 9, Tyr 5, Phe 9, Lys 19, His 2, Arg 3 and Trp 1 Asx including Asp and Asn, and Glx including Glu and Gln . The polypeptide is produced by cultivating a microorganism such as Escher ichia coli transformed with a plasmid containing a chemically synthesized DNA sequence coding for the corresponding amino acid sequence and extracting the polypeptide from the culture.
