# Ionic polyesters, electrically photosensitive composite particles and materials containing the polyesters and photoelectrophoretic imaging methods.

## Abstract
Novel polyesters comprise repeating units from a a diacid derived component comprising an alkali metal or ammonium sulfoarylene, sulfoaryloxyarylene, sulfocycloalkylene, iminodi sulfonylarylene, iminobis sulfonylarylene or sulfoarylkylarylene and b a diol or diacid derived component comprising bis N alkyl N alkyleneaminoaryl arylalkane bis N alkyl N alkyleneaminoaryl diarylalkane bis N alkyl N alkylene aminoaryl isoalkane bis N alkyl N alkylenenaminoaryl cycloalkane dialkyleneaminotetraarylalkane or bis alky lenearyl arylamine. The polyesters are useful to prepare electrically photo sensitive composite particles and electrically photosensitive materials containing an electrically insulating binder and the composite particles. The particles or materials can be used in a photoelectrophoretic migration imaging process which consists in placing them between two electrodes and submitting them to activating radiation and an electrical field for obtaining an image.
