# A substrate for manufacturing single crystal thin films.

## Abstract
A substrate for use in manufacturing single crystal thin films is a replica pattern of a monocrystalline or single crys tal cleavage plane. The replica pattern may be formed by pressing a material in a softened state against the cleavage plane of the single crystal with a subsequent hardening, or by subjecting the single crystal cleavage plane to vapor de position or plating and thereafter removing the deposition or plating from the single crystal cleavage plane.
