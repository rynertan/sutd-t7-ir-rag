## Description
This present invention relates to an improved solution process for the incorporation of a process oil into a neutralized sulfonated elastomeric polymer thereby resulting in blend compositions of the sulfonated elastomeric polymer and process oil which have unique physical and rheological properties. The elastomeric polymers of the present invention are derived from synthetic polymers having olefinic unsaturation sites, wherein the polymer has from 0 .l to 10.0 mole percent olefinic unsaturation. The unsaturation sites can be in the polymer backbone, pendant therefrom or cyclic, except that aromatic containing polymers are excluded from this description. In particular, the unsaturated polymers of this present invention are preferably EPDM terpolymers. A less preferred sulfonated elastomer polymer is sulfonated Butyl rubber however, the kind of oila as well as degree of incorporation of oil into the sulfonated Butyl rubber has to be modified due to differences between the sulfonated Butyl rubber and sulfonated EPDM terpolymers. The term EPDM is used in the sense of its definition as found in ASTM D 1418 ó4 and is intended to mean a terpolymer containing ethylene and propylene in the backbone and a diene in the side chain. Illustrative methods for producing these terpolymers are found in U.S. Patent 3,280,082, British Patent 1,030,289 and French Patent 1,386,600, which are incorporated herein by reference. The preferred terpolymars contain 45 to 75 wt. 7. ethylene and 2 to 10 wt. of a diene monomer, the balance of the polymer being propylene.More preferably, the polymer contains 50 to 70 wt. Z ethylene, e.g., 50 wt. 7., and 2.6 to 9.0 wt. 7. diene monomer, e.g., 5.0 wt. 7.. The diene monomer is preferably a nonconjugated diene. The Mn of the terpolymer is preferably 10,000 to 200,000 more preferably 15,000 to 100,000 and most preferably 20,000 to 60,000. The Mooney viscosity ML, 1 8 8, 212 F of the terpolymer is preferably 5 to 90, more preferably 10 to 50 and most preferably 15 to 40, e.g., 20. TheMv of the EP3M is preferably below 350,000, and more preferably below 300,000, e.g., 270,000. The Mw of the EPDM is preferably below 500,000, and more preferably below 350,000, e.g., 343,000. Illustrative of these nonconjugated diene monomers which may be used in the EPDM terpolymer are 1,4 hexadiene, dicyclopentadiene, 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene, 5 methylene 2 norbornene, 5.propenyl 2 norbornene and methyl tetrahydroin. dene. A typical EPDM is Vistalon 2504 Exxon Chemical Co. , a terpolymer having a Mooney viscosity ML, 1 8, 212 F of 40 and having 50 wt. we of ethylene, 45 wt. of propylene and 5.0 wt. a of 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene with an Mn of 47,000, an Mv of 145,000 and an Mw of 174,000. The Vista lon 2504 can be reprocessed through an extruder to produce a material having a Mooney viscosity of 20. Vistalon 3708 Exxon Chemical Co. is a terpolymer having a Mooney viscosity ML, 1 8, 2600 F of 45 55 and having 65 wt. 7. of methylene, 33 wt. of propylene and 3.7 wt. 7. 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene with an Mn of 53,000, anMw of 343,000 and an Mv of 270,000. Vistalon 6505 Exxon Chemical Co. is a terpolymer having a Mooney viscosity ML, 1 8, 2600F of 45 55 and having 53 wt. 7. of ethylene, 9 0 wt. of 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene and 38 wt. 7. of propylene. Nordel 1320 duPont is another EPDM terpolymer having a Mooney viscosity ML, 1 8, 212 F of 25 and having 53 wt. X of ethylene, 3.5 wt. Z of 1,4 hexadiene and 43.5 wt. 7. of propylene. In carrying out the present invention, an olefinically unsaturated polymer is sulfonated with a sulfonating agent selected from an acyl sulfate, a mixture of sulfuric acid and an acid anhydride or a sulfur trioxide donor com plexed with a Lewis base containing oxygen, nitrogen or phosphorus. The term sulfur trioxide donor as used in the specification means a compound containing available sulfur trioxide. Illustrative of such sulfur trioxide donors are S03, chlorosulfonic acid, fluorosulfonic acid, sulfuric acid, oleum, etc. The term complexing agent 1 as used in the specificatlon means a Lewis base suitable for use in the practice of this invention, wherein a Lewis base is an electron pair donor. Typical Lewis bases are dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, tetrahydrothiophene or triethyl phosphate. The molar ratio of SO3 donor to complexing agent may be as high as 15 1 preferably less than 9 1, more preferably 4 1 to 1 1, e.g., 2 1. The preferred solvents for preparation of the complexes of sulfur trioxide donor with complexing agents are chlorinated hydrocarbons. Illustrative of such chlorinated solvents are carbon tetrachloride, dichloroethane, chloroform, and methylene chloride. The complexes may also be prepared by direct addition of reagents if precautions are taken to dissipate evolved heat. The reactions of ethereal complexes of S03 with the unsaturation of polymer chains has been found to be nonquantitative generally because they are consumed through side reactions with impurities such as water. Therefore, the use of excess complex is desirable to give the required amount of sulfonation. Other suitable sulfonating agents are the acyl sulfates, which are selected from acetyl, propionyl, butyryl or benzoyl sulfate, in particular acetyl sulfate. The acyl sulfate may be produced by reacting concentrated sulfuric acid with an acid anhydride or an acid halide in the presence or the absence of a solvent. For example, acetic anhydride may be reacted with sulfuric acid to form acetyl sulfate which may be used to sulfonate the polymers of this invention. If desired, acetic anhydride may be added to a solution of the polymer in a suitable solvent and sulfuric acid subsequently added to form acetyl sulfate in situ. Alternatively, acetyl sulfate may be performed by reaction of sulfur trioxide with acetic acid in a non reactSve solvent. It should be pointed out that neither the sulfonating agent nor the manner of sulfonation is critical, providing that the sulfonation method does not degrade the polymer backbone. In the practice of this invention, the polymer to be sulfonated is dissolved in a suitable solvent and reacted with the sulfonating agent. The solvent medium must be a neutral one for the rubber and the sulfonating agent. The solvent is preferably an aromatic hydrocarbon, an aliphatic hydrocarbon, a cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon or a halogenated aromatic hydrocarbon. Illustrations of these solvents are isopentane, pentane, cyclohexane, isohexane, hexane, heptane and homologues thereof, benzene, toluene, chlorobenzene or xylene. The preferred solvent is an aliphatic hydrocarbon. Sulfonation of the polymer is conducted at a temperature between 100 C and 1000 C. Sulfonation occurs when the sulfonating agent is added to the polymer solution0The sulfonating agent is dissolved in a suitable solvent, or may be added directly without solvent. With acetyl sulfate reagent it is most preferred to add acetic anhydride to the polymer cement and then sulfuric acid to prepare the acetyl sulfate reagent in situ. Reaction time may be 1 to 60 minutes, more preferably 5 to 45 and most preferably 15 to 30, wherein the product remains soluble throughout the reaction period. The acid form of the sulfonated elastomer is quenched with water, or a liquid aliphatic alcohol such as methanol, ethanol or isopropanol, an aromatic hydroxyl compound such as phenol, or a cycloaliphatic alcohol such as cyclohexanol. The amount of desirable sulfonation depends on the particular application. Preferably, the elastomeric polymer is sulfonated at 10 to 60 meq. S03H l00 g of polymer, more preferably at 15 to 50 meq. S03H 100 g of polymer and most preferably at 20 to 40 meq. S03H l00 g of polymer.The sulfonic acid content can be determined by either titration of the polymeric sulfonic acid or Dietert Sulfur analysis. In the titration of the sulfonic acid the polymer is dissolved in solvent consisting of 95 parts of toluene and 5 parts of methanol at a concentration level of 50 grams per liter of solvent. The acid form is titrated with ethanolic sodium hydroxide to an Alizarin Thymolphthalein endpoint. Polymers containing unsaturation and sulfonic acid groups have been found to be somewhat deficient in thermostability. Therefore, it is desirable to neutralize at least a portion of the sulfonic acid as part of the manufacturing of sulfonated elastomeric polymer. Neutralization further improves the physical properties of the sulfonated polymer. In preparing the ionomer, it is not necessary to neutralize every sulfonic acid group. Preferably, at least 75 of the sulfonic acrd groups are n utralized, though 100 of the acids may be neutralized it desired more preferably 90 to 100 or the sulfuric acid groups are neutralized most preferably 95 to 100 are neutralizec. The neutralizing agents of the present invention may be basic salts of carboxylic acids, wherein the cation of the basic salt is a metal of Groups EA, TIA, IB or rIB of the Periodic Table of Elements, ammonium, aluminum, lead, iron or antimony or a mixture thereof. Suitable monovalent metal ions are Na, K, Li, Cs,Ag, Hg, and Cu. Suitable divalent metal ions are Be, tµg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Cu, Cd, Hg, Pb, Fe, Hg, and Zn. The carboxylate ion of the metallic salt is derived from the following carboxylic acids as illustrated in the present invention however, other carboxylic acids of the same generic class can be readily employed and are consider ed within the spirit and scope of the present embodiment. These carboxylic acids are acetic, benzoic, lauric, pal mitic, myristic, decanoic, octanoic, and stearic. Neutralization can also be effected with metallic oxides wherein the metallic ion is lead or a metal of Groups IIA or IIB of the Periodic Table of Elements or a mixture thereof. Illustr tive examples are MgO, CaO, BaO, ZnO, Pb02 or Pb304 any tures thereof. Other neutralizing agents are basic salts cz hydroxides or alkoxides, wherein the cation is annnonium or a metal of Groups IA or IIA f the Periodic Table of Elements cf a mixture thereof. Useful examples of hydraxid s are NH4OH, NaOH,KOH, LiOH, Mg OH 2 and Ba OH 2. To the neutralized sulfonated terpolymer in solution may be added a preferential plasticizer which may be a carboxylic acid or the ammonium or metal salts of these carboxylic acids, wherein the metal cation of the salt of the carboxylic acid is lead, ifon, antimony, aluminum or a metal of GroupsIA, IIA, IB or 113 of the Periodic Table of Elements thereof.The preferential plasticizer is incorporated into the neutralized sulfonated EPDM terpolymer at about 0 to about 45 parts per hundred by weight of 100 parts by weight of sulfonatec EPDM, more preferably at O to 35, and most preferably at O to 25 alternative preferential plasticizers may be organic esters, alcohols, phosphates, amines, amides or ureas and mixtures thereof . The preferred plasticizers are selected from long chain saturated aliphatic carboxylic acids such as stearic acid or the corresponding metallic salts and mixtures thereof. The oils employed in the present invention are non polar backbone process oils having less than 2 wt. 7. polar type compounds as measured by molecular type clay gel analysis, more preferably less than 0.75 wt. 7., and most preferably less than 0.5 wt. . These oils may be paraffinics ASTM Type 104B as defined in ASTM D 2226 70, aroma tics ASTM Type 102 or naphthenics ASTM Type 104A wherein the oil has a flash point by the Cleveland open cup of at least 350 F, a pour point of less than 40 F, a viscosity of about 70 to about 3000 s.s.u. s and a number average molecular weight of 300 to 1000, more preferably 300 to 750.The preferred process oils are paraffinics. Table I illustrates typical oils encompassed by the scope of this invention. The preferred process oil is a paraffinic type naving an Mn of at least 300. Improved compression sets are obtained when oils having less than 20 wt. 7. aromatic constituents are used, more preferably less than 15 wt. 7., and most preferably less than 10 wt. 7.. The process oil is preferably incorporated into the elastomeric product at less than 200 parts by weight per 100 parts by.weight of the neutralized sulfonated elastomeric polymer, more preferably at 10 to 150, and most preferably at 25 to 125.

The polymer in the cement is sulfonated with a sulfonating agent to form an acid form of a sulfonated elastomeric polymer.The cement of the acid form of the sulfonated elastomeric polymer is quenched with an aliphatic alcohol to form a solution of the acid form of the sulfonated elastomeric polymer. The acid form of the sulfonated elastomeric polymer in solution is neutralized with a neutralizing agent to form the neutralized sulfonated elastomeric polymer in solution. A process oil is added under agitation to the solution of the neutralized sulfon ated elastomeric polymer to form an elastomeric blend of the process oil and the neutralized sulfonated elastomeric poly mer in solution. The elastomeric blend is recovered from the solution by steam stripping or other suitable recovery techniques. The advantages of the improved process of manu facture of these improved elastomeric blends may be more readily appreciated by reference to the following examples. EXAMPLE 1 PREPARATION OF OIL EXTENDED SULFONATED EPDM One hundred grams of an EPDM terpolymer Vistalon 2504 20 was dissolved in 1000 ml. of n hexane at 40 C. The EPDM had approximately 50X ethylene, 45Z propylene and 5a 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene and a Mooney viscosity ML, 1 r 8, 2120F of 20. After the cement was cooled to room temperature, 5.74 ml. of acetic anhydride 60.75 moles was added.While stirring the mixture, 2.1 ml. of 957. H2S04 37.5 mmoles was added dropwise. The sulfonated reaction was quenched after 30 minutes with 150 ml. of isopropanol. The acid form of the sulfonated polymer was analyzed by DietertSulfur Analysis to have 33 meq. of S03H groups per 100 grams of polymer. A solution of 9.86 grams 90 meq. 100g EPDM of zinc acetate dihydrate dissolved in 25 ml. of distilled water was then added in the cement and the cement stirred for an additional 30 minutes. Antioxidant 2246 0.5 grams was then added to the cement. The sulfonated neutralized polymer in cement will be designated A . A paraffinic process oil, Sunpar 2280, was next added at a level of 50 grams 50 phr to the cement. The resulting oil extended neutralized sulfonated EPDM terpolymer B was then isolated by steam stripping and forced air drying. Composition B was found to be a free flowing polymer crumb. The precursor EPDM terpolymer Vistalon 2504 20 will be designated as C . To C was added 50 phr ofSunpar 2280 on a two roll rubber mill. The resulting ccmp osition D was extremely soft and tacky and required scraping from the mill. Both compositions C and D were observed to cold flow on a table top under their own weight.within minutes. Compositions A and B were placed in 55 gal. drums and examined one month later. Surprisingly, the material at the bottom of the drums exhibited no cold flow behavior and was essentially identical to that at the top. Preoil extension of the sulfonated elastomer had not altered its excellent cold flow characteristics.EXAMPLE 2 A neutralized sulfonateQ EPDM terpolymer cement was prepared according to composition A in Example 1. To the cement was added stearic acid under agitation at a level of 90 meq. lOOg of EPUM. The cement was then divided into three aliquots into which were added 0, 25, and 75 grams 100 grams of EPDM of a paraffinic process oil Sunpar 2280.The resulting compositions were isolated by steam stripping and drying. The dried compositions were compression molded at 3500F for 5 minutes. Tensile stress strain measurements were performed on micro tensile specimens cut from the molded pads. The measurements were made at an elevated temperature, 700 C, in order to examine the expected reduction in physical properties due to oil extension. To complement the tensile data, thermal mechanical analysis TMA was performed on the molded pads to investigate the softening behavior due to oil extension. The results of both measurements are shown inTable II. TABLE II EFFECT OF OIL EXTENSION ON PHYSICAL PROPERTIES Stress Strain Softening Sample at 70 Points, TMA 100 Tensile glOill Modulus Strength, lOOg EPDM psi psi Ti T2 No oil 84 100 44 105 25 pts. oil 58 75 42 103 75 pts. oil 27 28 37 92 It is readily apparent from the data abcve that at these oil levels, the softening points are sufficiently high and that the oil extended gums have considerable resistance to deformation at 70 C and thus have excellent cold flow characteristics. It is observed that there are two inflection points in the TSA curves above room temperature. It is surprisingly observed that both inflection points are not appreciably affected by the incorporation of considerable oil content 75 phr .However, the tensile stress strain behavior indicates that an upper limit of approximately 100 phr of oil for this particular neutralized and plasticized sulfonated EPDM terpolymer is practical. Above this level of oil extension the physical properties would besufficiently reduced to minimize the excellent properties of oil extended compositions. Thus a practical upper limit has been established and this example has illustrated that below this upper limit the oil extended plasticized and neutralized EPDM terpolymers exhibit surprisingly good tensile propertieso EXAMPLE 3 This example will demonstrate the effect of oil extension on the rheological characteristics of several sulfo EPDM gums. Throughout these studies an Instron Capillary Bheometer was employed to measure melt flow characteristics.Apparent viscosity values at various shear rates were determined at 200 C and used to character ize the flow behavior. A further characterization parameter which is obtained from these measurements is melt fracture. This is defined as the shear rate where the extrudate was clearly irregular in appearance and, therefore, of demon strably nonuniform flow. It is the intent of this example to describe the changes in the rheological characteristics of several sulfonated ethylene propylene terpolymer gums attributable to oil extension. The sulfonated elastomers used in this experiment were derived from an ethylene propylene 5 ethylidene 2norbornene ENB terpolymer compositionally comprising about 50Z ethylene, 45Z propylene and 5a ENB. Said polymer had a Mooney viscosity at 2129F of about 20. The sulfonic acid levels are given in the tables in terms of meq. of acid lOOg polymer and the neutralizations of said acids were performed in solution with 3 equivalents of metal acetate per equiva lent of sulfonic acid to ensure complete neutralization. Two oils have been employed in this study. The oil designated as Flexon 845 is classified by the ASTM as a 104B type. The carbon type analysis characterizes this oil as 2Z aromatic carbon, 297. naphthenic carbon and 6SZ paraffinic carbon. The oil designated as Sunpar 2280 is in the same class and is characterized as 4 aromatic carbon, 23 naphthenic carbon, and 737. paraffinic carbon. Both of these oils can be classified as paraffinic process oils. The sulfonated EPDM systems investigated are des cribed as containing 30 meq. sulfonate lOOg EPDM and both a magnesium and zinc neutralized form were employed. As shown in Table III, the introduction of approximately 50 phr parts per hundred rubber of a process oil converts an ssentially intractable material into a material which is coherent under shear and possesses markedly reduced melt viscosity, TABLE IIIApparent Viscosity,Sulfonation poise x 105 Melt CommentsLevel Neutralization Oil Level .74 7.4 74 740 Fracture onMeg. 100g EPDM Agent Oil Type phr sec 1 sec 1 sec 1 sec 1 sec 1 Strand Quality 30 Mg Ac 2 48.0 7.1 .95 .15 .3 Incoherent when 73 sec 1 30 Mg Ac 2 Flexon 845 54 12.3 2.1 .34 .05 7.4 Incoherent when 1400 sec 1 30 Zn Ac 2 22.3 5.1 .94 .15 29 Coherent commat 740 sec 1 30 Zn Ac 2 Sunpar 2280 50 6.5 1.6 .34 .06 146 Coherent commat 1400 sec 1 Surprisingly, it has been observed that the oil extended gums of this invention can maintain their improved rheological behavior at elevated temperatures, and yet at ambient temperatures they do not cold flow or agglomerate in the way that uncured elastomers such as EPDM of low ethylene content and low Mooney level commonly do. Simultaneously, these oil extended compositions tend to be softer than the unextended gums which makes their behavior even more remarkable. The introduction of this level of oil into Sulfo EPDM gums can be effected with both plasticized gums and unplasticized gums. The beneficial effects on melt viscosity are much more beneficial in the unplasticized gums however, there are also significant benefits in the cases of those gums which contain polar plasticizers to help in the dissociation of the ionic groups under mixing or fabrication conditions. The effect of oil extension with a stearic acid plasticized gum is shown in Example 2.EXAMPLE 4 COMPOUND BASED ON OIL EXTENDED SULFO EPDM TERPOLYMER A sulfonated neutralized EPDM terpolymer cement was prepared as in Example 1, Composition A. To the cement was added 45 meq. lOOg EPDM of stearic acid and 37 phr of a paraffinic rubber process oil Sunpar 180. The oil extended neutralized sulfonated EPDM was isolated by steam stripping and drying. The oil extended gum described above is particularly desirable for use in developing high flow, sort compounds. For example, 150 parts of this composition can be combined with 70 parts of a paraffinic process oil such as Sunpar 2280 and 75 parts of a mineral filler such as ground calcium carbonate in a Banbury or similar intensive mixing machine.Mixing cycles of 5 to 10 minutes are sufficient to produce a homogeneous compound with excellent physical and rheological properties. On the other hand, using an identical gum without the pre oil extension would require the addition of a larger quantity of oil 107 phr relative to the gum during the mixing operation which would be difficult to mix into the neutralized sulfonated gum homogeneously. Mixing times can increase by a factor of two, thus requiring both additional time and energy. Furthermore, the resulting compost tions would not appear homogeneous as evidenced by erratic physical properties, i.e. low tensile elongations, variations in physical properties dependent on location of tensile specimen, and poor tear resistance.Thus, the use of preoil extended sulfonated EPDM compositions are particularly preferred for compounds which have high oil extension and generally are soft. EXAMPLE 5 PREPARATION OF A NEUTRALIZED LIGHTLY SULFONATED POLYMER An EPDM was used as the backbone elastomeric polymer. It had a composition of 52 wt. 7. ethylene, 43 wt. 7. propylene and 5 wt. of 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene, and it had a Mooney viscosity ML commat 1000C. 1 8 min of 20. This base polymer was lightly sulfonated using acetyl sulfate in accordance with the method disclosed in U.S. Patent 3.836,511 to a sulfonate level of about 32 meq. per 100 g of base polymer. The acid form of this lightly sulfonated elastomer was neutralized in solution by the addition of excess zinc acetate at a concentration or 60 meq. per 100 g of polymer.This material was steam stripped and then dried in a fluidized bed hot air drier. This material was utilized for the preparation of some of the samples which are described in the following examples. This zinc neutral zed lightly sulfonated EPDM was quite tough even at elevated temperatures, and it was too intractable to be fabricated by rapid polymer processing techniques such as extrusion or injection molding.EXAMPLE 6 PREPARATION OF A PLASTICIZED, NEUTRALIZED, SUL FONATED EPDM COMPOUND CONTAINING OIL AND A MINERAL F LLER A compound of the non plasticized gum described in Example 5 was formulated with the following ingredients Wt. Fer 100g Wt. used in Ingredient of gum phr mix g Gum 100 24.1Zinc Stearate 19 4.6Sunpar 2280, process oil 60 14.5Purecal U, calcium carbonate 120 29.0 The chemical properties which are typically emplayed to characterize the process oil are described inTable IV. Purecal J is a precipitated calcium carbonate made by the BASF Wyandotte Company. The ingredients were blended in a Brabender Plasticorder having a 60 cc. mixing head with Banbury mixing blades as follows. Before adding any ingredients to the mixing head, five grams cf tne Purecal U were preblended with half cf the zine stearate in a beaker at room temperature with a spatula. The other half of the zinc stearate was preblended with the gum in another beaker at room temperature using a spatula. The empty mixing head was set at 115 C. and run initially at 30 RPM.Enough of the non preblended Purecal 3 was added to the running mixer to fill it loosely up to the gate region.All of the oil was then added. About two thirds of the gum zinc stearate preblend was next added to the mixer. These ingredients formed a white doughy mass which incorporated the filler which had been loose in the mixer and resulted in a compacted material. Rhe rest of the ncn preblended filler could then be added, and then the rast of the gum zinc stearate preblend was added. Finally, the preblend ofPurecal U and zinc stsarate was added to the mixer, At this point with all of the ingredients added, the mix was still white and doughy, and not a fused melt. The mix was purposely kept at a temperature well below the melting point of the preferential plasticizer up to this point.The reason for this was to avoid melting of the zinc stearate and plasticizing of the gum, since the plasticized gum would form a fused melt much more readily than the unplasticized gum. With the gum not yet fused into a coherent melt the additives which are liquid at the temperature of addition are much more quickly incorporated into the mix, whereas, when an appreciable quantity of a liquid is added to a fused melt, the liquid is taken up by the melt slowly thereby prolonging the time required for the mix. In some cases the addition of liquids or additives which melt even causes loss of torque in the mix because the unincorporated liquid lubricates the melt and allows it to slide around in the mixer rather than being mixed and sheared.An additional advantage of utilizing this prccedure of initially mixing the ingredients at a temperature well below the melting point of the polar plasticizer is that the oil need not be premixed with the filler, as is commonly done to speed up the incorporation or the oil into the polymer. In this procedure of initially mixing well below the melting point of the polar plasescizer, the resulting doughy and non fused state of the mix allows oil and other liquids to be rapidly taken up into the non fused mixture so that premixing of the oil is not required. After the doughy mass was mixed for 8 short time the mixing speed was increased to 75 RPM, and the heat generated by the shearing action increased the temperature to about 130 C. At this temperature the zinc stearate plasticizer was melted, and the material was now a smooth homogeneous fused melt and was mixing very well. The mixing head was then heated by its electric heater to 1400 C. at which point the mix was removed from the Brabender head and sheeted by a single pass through a room temperature 2 roll mill. Total mixing time was about 12 minutes.The compound was an off white color, and it appeared uniform and to have excellent dispersion of the ingredients EXAMPlE 7 COMPRESSION SET OF A SU5LFOMATED EPDM COMPOUND CONTAINING PROCESS OILS HAVING VARIOUS POLAR CONCENTRATIONS The compound described in Example 6, was prepared, and in addition seven similar compounds were also made.These other compounds differed from the compound of Example 6, only in that the process oil was different instead of the Sunpar 2280 oil, the other oils listed in Table IV were substituted at the same weight concentration. Compression set measurements were made on each of these eight sam ples as follows. Test disks were made from each of the samples by compression molding a 0.06 inch thick pad at 3500 C. Onehalf inch dismeter disks were cut from the pads and plied 4 high to form a test sample which was about 0.24 inches high. These tests were made at.room temperature under controlled dry conditions. The test used was the standardASTM D 395 Method B, which involves 25Z compressfon of the samples for 22 hrs., followed by 30 minutes recovery after the compressive force is removed. Results for the compounds containing the various oils is given in Table IV. By comparing the results of this table, with the chemical properties of the various oils which are listed in Table IV, it is seen that only the oils with concentrations of polar compounds below 0.4 wt. 7. give the lowest compression set values for these materials of 20Z or less. The oils with higher content of polar compounds give significantly higher compression set values of from 24 to 33. For example, even the best of the oils which have a polar content of aver 0.4, the Sunpar 180 oil, has a compression set of 24 which is a fractional increase of over 40 above that of the low polar content Tufflo 6026 Such an increase in compression set is likely to limit the applications for the material since compression set is such a crucial property in many applications. Of course, those oils with higher polar contents of above 0.75 have even higher compression set values and will be even more limited in their applications.Various specific applications for articles such as gaskets, and hoses have stringent compression set requirements, such that each increase in compression set for an elastomer will prevent utilization of that elastomer for a certain range of specific applications. Thus, a difference in compression set of 57. can make the difference between utilization or non utilization of a particular elastomer in a specific application. Therefore, the use of low polar content processing oils will maximize the range of compression set sensitive applications for which a sulfonated EPDM elastomer can be used. It is of interest to consider the other chemical properties which are typically given for process oils these are listed in Table IV. Aniline point is generally considered a measure of solvency power, with a low AnilinePoint being associated with high solvency. It is conceivable that this high solvency could result in partial solvation of the physical crosslinkes of the sulfonated EPDM by the oil, thereby increasing compression set. However, surprisingly, the listed Aniline Point data indicates no correlation between Aniline Point and compression set of the sulfonated EPDM compositions. For example, the lowestAniline Point oil listed is Sunpar 2280 and the highest is Flexon 340, yet these two oils have very close compression set values.The naphthenic or paraffinic nature of the oil, given in columns 6 and 7 of Table tV also seem to have little direct effect on compression set. For example, the compression set of the paraffinic oil Tufrlo 6026 is not much different from that of the naphthenic oil Tufflo 6014, whereas the two paraffinic oils Tufflo 6026 and Sunpar 2280 have widely different compression set values. Aromatics content does not appear to have an effect on compression set above about 20 wt. Z of aromatic constituents sinceFlexon 340 and Sunpar 2280 have greatly different aromatic content, and yet they both yield compositions having high compression set values.Those oils which give the better compression set values have the lower aromatic contents of less than 20 wt. Z, and the best compression set values were obtained with oils having aromatic contents of less than 10 wt. . In 3summary, the wt. percent polar compounds in the oil differentiates between oils which give improved compression set behavior and oils which give less desirable compression set behavior. Therefore, process oils having polar contents no higher than 0.75 we. , and preferably no higher than 0.4 wt. r,, and aromatic constituents of less than about 20 wt. , more preferably less than 15 wt. , are desirable in the many applications of sulfonatedEPDM for which compression set is of crucial importance.

EXAMPLE 8 MELT FLOW AND TENSILE PROPERTIES GF A SULFONATED EPDM COMPOUND CONTAINING PROCESS OILS HAVING Dub RENT POLAR CONCENTRATIONS In Example 7, it was demonstrated that the use of low polar content process oils resulted in improved compression set for the compounds. In this example, three of the com pounds of Example 7 are compared in their melt flow rates processibility at 190 C. and in their room temperature and 70 C. tensile properties. The compounds in this example employ the oils Sunpar 2280, Shellflex 371, and ECA 6492 see Table IV for their specifications and manufacturers . Test pads were made from these samples by compression mold ing at 350 F. The procedure was to preheat the empty mold plates in the press for a few minutes, then the matarial was put in the mold and the mold containing the material was preheated in the press with the mold platas slightly open for two minutes. Then the mold plates were pressed closed under a force of about 20 tons ror two minutes. The samples were cooled in the molds under pressure for two minutes.Microtensile pads having a thickness of about 0.6 mm and test regions measuring 2.54 mm in width and 12.7 mm in length were cut from the test pads with a die. The samples were stored in closed dry bottles for one or more days prior to tensile testing. Tensile strengths of the samples were measured with an Xnstron TM table model instrument, using a pulling speed of 51 mm per minute. Measurements were made at room temperature 25 C. , and also at a higher temperature to determine the usefulness of the materials at elevated temperature. In the measurements at elevated temperature, after being placed in the testing oven, a 3 minute waiting period was allowed before pulling to enable the sample to equilibrate with the oven temperature The elevated tern perature utilized in most measurements was 7Q C. Melt flow rates for the various materials were determined at 190 C. wnich is m the range cf typical processing temperatures for lightly sulfonated ECUM. The melt index instrument specified in ASTM 1238 70 was used, with the standard capillary. The weight of the probe plus the added weight was L2.5 kilograms. Flow rates were measured electronically as probe displacetnent per minute, and these results were converted to grams per 10 minutes using a conversion factor. The melt flow rates and tensile properties for the compounds with the different oils are shown in Table V.From Table V we saw that the compound containing the more polar Sunpar 2280 oil had a compression set which was far greater than for the compounds containing the low polar content oils Shellflex 371 and ECA 6492, An important question is whether this substantial improvement in compression set behavior is associated with detrimental changes in melt flaw rate or tensile properties. From Table V we see that there is negligible difference in melt flow rates. Therefore the improvement in compression set is at no cost to high temperature melt processability of the compounds containing the lower polar content oils. Also, at both 25 C. and at 70 C. we see that the softnesses or stiffnesses as reflected in the initial modulii of the different materials are essentially identical to within experimental error for the compounds with the different oils. Only in the elongation of the samples is there a significant difference and, of course, this difference in elongation is reflected in the maximum tensile strength of the samples. This decrease in elongation for the compounds containing the low polar content oils Shellflex 371 and ECA 6492 is roughly 25X, and results in a decrease in tensile strength of about 10 to 15 percent. Therefore, in applications where high extensions of well over 200 are required, compression set may have to be sacrificed for the greater elongation, and a higher polar content oil may be needed.However, in a large range of applications, and probably in the majority of applications, high elongations are not required and compression set is more of a concern. For example, in almost all compressive mode applications high elongations are not needed such as for gaskets, and flexible padding. Another major application which does not require high elongations is in flexible tubing. This is an application which requires good compression set in order to maintain secure leak proof seals to the fitting at the end of the hoses. In summary, the utilization of low polar content oils in sulfonated EPUM compounds to obtain lower compression set should be advantageous in most applications as it causes no significant change in melt flow rate processibility , or softness.Only in those particular uses where high elongation is a requirement might the use of the low polar content oils not be advisable.

EXAMPLE 9 PREPARATION OF A HIGH FLOW SULFONATED EPDM COMPOUND The EPDM backbone polymer described in Example 5 was sulfonated to about 32 meq. per lOOg of base polymer as described in that example and then neutralized with 90 meq. of zinc acetate. 90 meq. of a non volatile polar preferential plasticizer, stearic acid was also added to the solution prior to steam stripping. This plasticized gum was steam stripped and then dried in a dewatering extruder. A compound was formulated from this plasticized gum with the following ingredients wt. per 100g of wt. used Ingredient plasticized gum phr in mix g Plasticized gum 100 23.7 Sunpar 180 Oil 85 20.1 Purecal U 40 9.5 Protox 166 25 5.9 Titanox 1000 5 1.2 Mg OH 2 0.55 0.13 F 3504 wax 15 3.6 The manufacturer and the chemical properties of the oil are described in Table IV.Purecal U is a precipitated calcium carbonate made by the EASF Wyandotte Company.Protox 166 is zinc oxide made by New Jersey Zinc Co.,Titanox 1000 is titanium dioxide made by National LeadIndustries Inc., and F 3504 is a wax made by Exxon ChemicalCompany. The ingredients were blended in a Brabender Plas ticorder having a 60 cc. mixing head with Banbury mixing blades. The mix was done upside down with the filler ane oil being added first at 100 C. and then the gum and other components being added later. A 30 RPM speed was used for the first part of the mix. After everything was added to the mixer, the speed was increased to 50 RPM and the temperature was raised rapidly to 1400 C. by electrical heating.A total mixing time of about 12 minutes was used, good mixing was obtained and a homogeneous compound having good dispersion of the ingredients was produced.EXAMPLE 10 COMPRESSION SET OF A HIGH MELT FLOW SULFONATED EPDM COMPOUND CONTAINING PROCESS OILS HAVING DIFFERENT POLAR CONCENTRATIONS The high melt flow compound prepared in Example 9 is used in this example, and, in addition, a second high flow compound was prepared which was identical to that ofExample 9 except for substituting a very low polarity oil,ECA 6492 Table IV , for the Sunpar 180 oil. These compounds were made with two different sets of plasticized gum which were both prepared as described in Example 5, but gumB was prepared about a year later than gum A Compression set measurements were made on these two sets of compounds using ASTM D 395 Method B except that because of material limitations smaller size samples were used the smaller size appeared to have no significant effect on the test results .The e tests were done under ambient room conditions at room temperature and involved 25X compression of the samples for 22 hours, followed by 30 minutes recovery after the compressive force is removed. Results for these high melt flow compounds containing different oils is given in Table VII. The relative results are similar to those for the other compound used for these oils in Example 3 and Table V. The very low polar oil ECA 6492 maintains a significant advantage in compression set over that of the more polar Sunpar 180 oil.The same difference is manifested with both the older gum A and the new gum B . The older gum A exhibits a change in compression set as compared with the newer gum B , but identical changes are shown by both of the oils. This example shows that the advantage in compression set of the very low polarity oil is a general phenomenon for the sulfonated EPDM material, and is not restricted to a particular formulation or particular additives. For instance, the compound of this example is a high melt flow material having roughly 10 times the melt flow of the compound of Example 3, and its total compression set is considerably greater than for the compound in Example 7. The compound of this example also uses a different plasticizer, stearic acid rather than zinc stearate. Furthermore, this high flow compound contains a higher concentration of oil and a much lower concentration of filler, as well as a number of additional additives such as wax and zinc oxide. With all of these changes1 an improvement in compression set which is very similar to the improvement for the com pound of Example 7, is obtained by changing from the more polar Sunpar 180 oil to the very low polarity ECA 6492 oil.
