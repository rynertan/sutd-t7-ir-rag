# Delayed restraint release device for inflatable escape slides.

## Abstract
A delayed restraint releaseable device utilized to restrain and controllably release the lower end of an inflating escape slide at a predetermined pressure, orientation and time. The device combines two distinct restraint mechanisms into one combination unit. The primary release is accomplished by means of shear pin or pins 56 located at the first end of the device. Under normal conditions, the release is accomplished by shearing of the pin or pins under the load provided by the tied back inflating slide. The back up release, in series with primary release, occurs when the pressure of the reduced load causes a piston 74 within the restraint to move against both a spring 100 and captive fluid. As the piston moves, the fluid transfers through a precise sized orifice 94 in the piston, from one side of the piston to the other. The piston moves eventu ally to a point at which the interlocking leg of the piston sup port shaft is released, thus allowing the ends of the mechanism to separate.
