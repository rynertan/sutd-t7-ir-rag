# Zero crossing comparators with threshold validation.

## Abstract
In carrier and timing recovery systems for high performance data modems it is essential to employ threshold comparators and to be able to determine accurately zero crossing instants. The circuit of the invention comprises a comparator with feedback which produces a positive transition of the comparator output in response to the negative zero crossing transition of the input signal on condition that the previous half cycle of the input signal has exceeded the positive reference threshold. In a practical arrangement two comparators C₁, C₂ provided together with a pair of bistable storage elements D₁,D₂ which produces a narrow pulse in response to the negative zero crossing transition of an input signal IPS provided that the input signal IPS has exceeded the positive reference threshold VT applied to the second comparator C₂ .
