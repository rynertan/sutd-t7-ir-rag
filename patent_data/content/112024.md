# Removal of impurities from molten aluminium.

## Abstract
Ti and V impurities are removed from molten aluminium by adding a boron bearing substance and agitating the aluminium in the presence of a dispersed chloride and or fluoride flux, active for fluxing Ti, V B₂ particles. It is preferred to perform the process by stirring the molten aluminum to generate a vortex, into which aluminium fluoride is introduced as a fluxing agent and for reaction with any alkali metal impurity present in the molten metal. The alkalimetal fluoaluminate thus generated assists the fluxing of the Ti, V B₂, as does any cell electrolyte present in the molten aluminium.
