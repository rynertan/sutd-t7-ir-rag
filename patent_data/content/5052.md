# Scalpel blade extractor.

## Abstract
A scalpel blade extractor is provided which permits safe removal of used blades from scalpels or the like in which a slotted blade is received in opposed lateral grooves in a thin elongate tang with a proximal region of the blade located behind the tang in a cut away laterally convergent region intermediate the tang and the handle. The device includes a base wall 46 over whose surface the scalpel is advanced and having laterally opposed protuberant regions 43, 44 over which the blade slides. A slot 45 between the protuberant regions which receives the tang of the scalpel but not the blade. A fully inserted position of the scalpel is defined by abutment between the two proximal edges of the protuberant regions and said convergent region. A rear wall 52 is supported behind the slot 45 with its lower edge spaced from the base wall 46 to allow the scalpel and blade to be inserted therebetween and to allow a fully inserted scalpel to be pivoted about the lower edge to a tilted orientation in which the proximal end of the blade is levered away from the intermediate region clear of the tang and is retained by interference with the rear wall 52 during removal of the scalpel handle in the tilted orientation. Guide surface 54 proximally of the slot directs the scalpel blade or handle into the slot.
