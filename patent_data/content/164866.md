# Maintaining liquid level in a centrifugal separator.

## Abstract
In order to subject a valve 7 within the rotor of a centrifugal separator to a certain liquid pressure, a chamber 9 on one side of the valve is connected to an axial channel 12 in the vertical drive shaft 13 of the rotor, and a liquid surface is maintained in the channel very close to the axis of the rotor during the operation of the rotor. At the lower end of the drive shaft, the channel 12 opens axially though an orifice 31 having its edge at the desired radial level for the liquid surface, and this end of the shaft is arranged to rotate in a liquid body in a container 25 below the drive shaft 13 .
