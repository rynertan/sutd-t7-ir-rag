# CABLE LAYING APPARATUS

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for laying cable at an obstruc tion comprises a collapsible reel 21 , an unwind guide 71 and a rewinding device 23 . The collapsible reel 21 has an end flange 242 which can be removed and radially collapsi ble surface segments 245,246 which allow, with the reel 21 removed from the laying vehicle 10 , the inner end of the cable to be found and withdrawn, passed through an excavation 20 under the obstruction and rewound. The rewind device 23 is arranged to introduce a twist into the cable in a direction opposite to that inserted by the unwinding. The rewind device 23 includes an arm 39 rotatable around a stationary reel 24 with traverse means 50 for wrapping the cable onto the reel in similar manner from that which it is withdrawn from the first reel 21 .
