# Travelling wire electroerosion method and apparatus.

## Abstract
A traveling wire electroerosion method and apparatus in which the cutting feed rate is cyclically increased and decreased in a prescribed manner. In a first step of the method, the cutting feed is effected along one portion of a commanded feed path at a maximum rate by a certain first extent such that the traveling wire span between the guide members bends backwards, thus deviating beyond a certain degree from the straight line path established between the guide members. In a second step, the cutting feed is effected along another portion of the feed path immediately following that one portion at a minimum rate and by a certain small extent such that the bent traveling wire span comes into alignment with the straight line wire travel path. A control unit 32 is provided which operates on a numerical controller 24 to repeat the two step cycle, and which may be operable also to act on a flushing medium supply unit 13 15 , a wire tension unit 8, 9, 11, 12, 32, 33 and a pow er supply unit 16 to minimize the rate reduced time period or distance of feed while maintaining the width of the cut slot or kerf G materially unvaried throughout the process.
