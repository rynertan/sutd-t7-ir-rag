# Apparatus and method for vulcanizing a tire.

## Abstract
This disclosure relates to an apparatus and method for vulcanizing a tire using a pair of split dies which form a tire receiving space between them when the dies are closed. The dies include sealing surfaces within the space and adjacent the axially outer surface of the tire beads. The apparatus is mounted within the space and within the inner diameter of the tire, and includes holding means which are radially movable into and out of engagement with the tire beads. The apparatus further includes extruding means which operate in association with the movement of the dies when opening and closing, for moving the holding means toward and away from the tire beads. When the dies are closed, the extruding means move the holding means to press the beads tightly against the sealing surfaces. The interior of the tire is then directly heated and pressurized.
