# STICK HOLDER DEVICE

## Abstract
A stick holder device for holding a stick of solid consum able material, such as cosmetics material, e.g. lipstick. To protect the stick held in a conventional device during placement and removal of a cap, it is known to provide an axially movable cap in which the stick is seated and a me chanism for retracting the stick into a base tube. However, such arrangements are complex and somewhat unstable mechanically. In the device of the invention a cover sleeve is axially movable relative to a handle in which the stick will be fixedly held selectively to conceal or expose the stick. The sleeve is itself manually engageable and can be manipulated as re quired for said axial movement. The construction is simple and effective and provides firm and stable mounting of the stick.
