# Improvements in or relating to the location of contact faults on electrically conductive cables.

## Abstract
The invention relates to the location of contact faults on electrically conductive cables such as telephone pairs. Contact fault location apparatus has a pair of resistors 24, 25 , a constant current source 22 and means such as a differential amplifier 30 and meter 35 for sensing the current flowing in the resistors 24, 25 . A pair of lines 10, 11 to be tested is looped at one end 15 , the apparatus is connected across the other end and the current flowing in the resistors 24, 25 is measured. The ratio of the current is indicative of the distance to the fault.
