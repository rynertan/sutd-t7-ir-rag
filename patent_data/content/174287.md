# A method and a device for monitoring hydro turbine plants.

## Abstract
This invention concerns a method and a device for monitoring hydro turbine plants. According to the invention the device comprises one or several hydro turbines, at least one of them T1 having adjustable vanes. For an optimum utilization of the available amount of water, the vane angles in the turbine T1 are automatically adjustable in dependance of the level in the water dam, which level is measured at predetermined intervals. When the plant comprises several turbines Tn , the level indicator is also used for start and stop.
