## Description
Herbicidal Composition and Method of Combating UndesiredPlant Growth This invention relates to herbicidal compositions and method of combating undesired plant growth. UK Patent Specification No.1,132,306 discloses that certain triazine compounds are useful as herbicides. Especially useful is the compound 2 chloro 1 cyano 2 chloro 4 l cyano l methylethylamino 6 ethyl amino 1,3,5 triazine, which has the proprietary name cyanazine.It combines a good pre and post emergence effect on very many broad leaved weeds with some useful control of grasses. It is used as a selective herbicide in many crops, for example cereals such as wheat, barley and maize, and vegetables such as peas and broad beans. US Patent Specification No.2,655,447 discloses that certain urea derivatives are also useful as herbicides. Many of these ureas have been commercialized. For example, the compounds 3 4isopropylphenyl l,l dimethylurea, proprietary name isoproturon, and 3 3 chloro 4 methylphenyl 1,1 dimethylurea, proprietary name chlortoluron, are used as pre and post emergence herbicides for the control of grass weeds in crops, including cereals.Their activity against broad leaved weeds is relatively weak. The Applicants have now found that certain mixtures of triazines with ureas exhibit an unexpected synergistic effect. The invention provides a herbicidal composition which comprises a compound of the general formula EMI2.1 in which X represents a halogen atom, an alkoxy or alkythio group, an N3 group or a group of formula NR5R6 each of R1 and 3 independently represents a hydrogen atom or an aralkyl, alkyl or alkenyl group optionally substituted by one or more of the same or different substituents selected from hydroxy, alkoxy, alkylthio and cyano groups each of R3 and R4 independently represents an alkyl, alkenyl or aralkyl group, or R3 and R 6 together represent an alkylene group and each of R5 and R independently has one of the meanings given for R1 and R together with a compound of the general formulaEMI2.2 in which Y represents an alkyl group Z represents a hydrogen or a halogen atom R7 represents a hydrogenatom or an alkyl or alkoxy group and R8 represents an alkyl group. The invention further provides a method of combating undesired plant growth at a locus, which comprises applying to the locus a compound of the general I and a compound of the general formula II. Unless otherwise stated, any alkyl, alkoxy, alkylthio or alkenyl group referred to above in the general formulae I and II preferably has up to 6, especially up to 4, carbon atoms. Any aralkyl group is preferably a phenalkyl, especially benzyl, group, and any alkylene group preferably has from 5 to 7 carbon atoms. In the general formula I, preferably X represents a halogen, especially chlorine, atom or a methylthio group. Preferably R1 represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl, ethyl or isopropyl group.Preferably Rê represents a methyl, ethyl or isopropyl group.Preferably each of R and R4 independently represents a methyl or ethyl group. An especially preferred compound of the general formula I is the compound in which X represents a chlorine atom, RÚ represents a hydrogen atom, Rê represents an ethyl group, and each of R and 14R represents a methyl group. In the general formula II, preferably Y represents a methyl, ethyl or isopropyl group. Preferably Z represents a chlorine or hydrogen atom. Preferably R7 represents a hydrogen, methyl or methoxy group. Preferably R8 represents a methyl group. Especially prefered componds of the general formula II are those in which each of R7 and R8 represents a methyl group, and either Y represents an isopropyl group and Z represents a hydrogen atom, or Y represents a methyl group and Z represents a chlorine atom. The weight ratio of the compound of the general formula I to the compound of general formula II may vary widely depending on the intended application. Preferably said ratio is in the range of from 1 50 to 50 1, preferably 1 20 to 20 1, especially 3 1 to 1 5. Suitably the dosage of each compound applied is in the range of from 0.1 to 4 kg ha. For example, a dosage of 0.1 to 1 kg ha of the compound of formula I may be applied together with 0.1 to 4 kg ha of the compound of formula II. The composition and method of the invention may be used for the control of weeds in a wide variety of crops, for example, cotton, soyabean, plantation crops such as sugar cane or vines, and, especially, cereals such as wheat, barley, maize and sorghum.A wide range of broad leaved and grassy weeds are controlled.Application may be pre emergence or post emergence, especially pre or early post emergence. For certain applications, especially when resistant weeds are present, it may be desirable also to apply a third herbicide. For example, if severe infestations of wild oat are present in cereal crops, it may be advantageous to apply along with the compounds of formulae I and II, one of the N,N disubstituted alanine derivatives described in UK PatentNo.1,164,160, for example the racemic mixture or laevo rotatory isomer of the ethyl ester of N benzoyl N 3,4 dichlorophenyl 2 aminopropionic acid, or the methyl or isopropyl ester of N benzoyl N 3 chloro 4 fluorophenyl 2 aminopropionic acid.If a very rapid action on resistant broad leaved weeds in required, one or more of the compounds 3 isopropyl lH benzo 2,1,3 thia diazin 4 one 2,2 dioxide proprietary name bentazone , 3,5dibromo 4 hydroxybenzonitrile proprietary name bromoxynil or 3, 5 diiodo 4 hydroxybenzonitrile proprietary name ioxynil , may be added. It may be desirable to add a hormone herbicide, for example 2 2,4 dichlorophenoxy propionic acid proprietary name dichlorprop , 4 chloro 2 methylphenoxyac et ic acid proprietary name MCPA , or 2 4 chloro 2 methylphenoxy propionic acid proprietary name mecoprop , for additional control of certain broadleaved weeds such as gallium. A composition according to the invention preferably also comprises one or more carriers. A carrier is any material with which the active ingredients are formulated to facilitate application to the locus to be treated, or to facilitate storage, transport or handling. A carrier may be a solid or a liquid, including a material which is normally gaseous but which has been compressed to form a liquid, and any of the carriers normally used in formulating herbicidal compositions may be used. Suitable solid carriers include natural and synthetic clays and silicates, for example natural silicas such as diatomaceous earths magnesium silicates, for example talcs magnesium aluminium silicates, for example attapulgites and vermiculites aluminium silicates, for example kaolinites, montmorillonites and micas calcium carbonate calcium sulphate synthetic hydrated silicon oxides and synthetic calcium or aluminium silicates elements, for example carbon and sulphur natural and synthetic resins, for example coumarone resins, polyvinyl chloride, and styrene polymers and copolymers solid polychlorophenols bitumen waxes, for example beeswax, paraffin wax, and chlorinated mineral waxes and solid fertlisers, for example superphosphates. Suitable liquid carriers include water alcohols, for example isopropanol and glycols for example acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone and cyclohexanone ethers aromatic or araliphatic hydrocarbons, for example benzene, toluene and xylene petroleum fractions, for example kerosine and light mineral oils chlorinated hydrocarbons, for example carbon tetrachloride, perchloroethylene and trichloroethane. Mixtures of different liquids are often suitable. Agricultural compositions are often formulated and transported in a concentrated form which is subsequently diluted by the user before application. The presence of small amounts of a carrier which is a surface active agent facilitates this process of dilution. A surface active agent may be an emulsifying agent, a dispersing agent or a wetting agent it may be nonionic or ionic.Examples of suitable surface active agents include the sodium or calcium salts of polyacrylic acids and lignin sulphonic acids the condensation products of fatty acids or aliphatic amines or amides containing at least 12 carbon atoms in the molecule with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide fatty acid esters of glycerol, sorbitan, sucrose or pentaerythritol condensates of these with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide condensation products of fatty alcohol or alkyl phenols, for example octylphenol or E octylcresol, with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide sulphates or sulphonates of these condensation products alkali or alkaline earth metal salts, preferably sodium salts, of sulphuric or sulphonic acid esters containing at least 10 carbon atoms in the molecule, for example sodium lauryl sulphate, sodium secondary alkyl sulphates, sodium salts of sulphonated castor oil, and sodium alkylaryl sulphonates such as sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate and polymers of ethylene oxide and copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. The compositions of the invention may for example be formulated as wettable powders, dusts, granules, solutions, emulsifiable concentrates, emulsions, suspension concentrates and aerosols.Wettable powders usually contain 25, 50 and 75 w of active ingredient and usually contain, in addition to solid inert carrier, 3 10 w of a dispersing agent and, where necessary, 010 w of stabiliser s and or other additives such as penetrants or stickers. Dusts are usually formulated as a dust concentrate having a similar compositions to that of a wettable powder but without a dispersant, and are diluted in the field with further solid carrier to give a composition usually containing 10 w of active ingredient. Granules are usually prepared to have a size between 10 and 100 BS mesh 1.676 0.152 mm , and may be manufactured by agglomeration or impregnation techniques.Generally, granules will contain 25 w active ingredient and 0 10 w of additives such as stabilisers, slow release modifiers and binding agents. Emulsifiable concentrates usually contain, in addition to a solvent and, when necessary, co solvent, 10 50 w v active ingredient, 2 20 w v emulsifiers and 0 20 w v of other additives such as stabilisers, penetrants and corrosion inhibitors.Suspension concentrates are usually compounded so as to obtain a stable, non sedimenting flowable product and usually contain 1075 w active ingredient, 0.5 15 w of dispersing agents, 0.110 w of suspending agents such as protective colloids and thixotropic agents, 0 10 w of other additives such as defoamers, corrosion inhibitors, stabilisers, penetrants and stickers, and water or an organic liquid in which the active ingredient is substantially insoluble certain organic solids or inorganic salts may be present dissolved in the formulation to assist in preventing sedimentation or as anti freeze agents for water. Aqueous dispersions and emulsions, for example compositions obtained by diluting a wettable powder or a concentrate according to the invention with water, also lie within the scope of the present invention. The said emulsions may be of the water in oil or of the oil in water type, and may have a thick mayonnaise like consistency. The compositions of the invention may also contain other ingredients, for example, compounds possessing insecticidal or fungicidal properties. The following Examples illustrate the invention.Example 1 Synergistic Effect of Cyanazine Chlortoluron Mixtures on Blackgrass Seeds of blackgrass, Alopecurus ipyosuroides, were sown in sterilized loam in 70 mm diameter pots, and watered overhead until emergence and then by sub irrigation on capilliary matting. After sowing the seeds the soil in each pot was sprayed with an aqueous solution of the test compound or mixture in a volume equivalent to 650 litres ha. Each compound or mixture was applied at three dose levels and there were three replicate pots for each treatment. Within each dose level, the dosages of the active ingredients were calculated using formulae i and ii below, which assume that the compounds will act additively. Thus if the compounds do in fact act additively, similar levels of phytotoxicity should be obtained in all treatments. This makes accurate comparision of the treated plants possible. a dosage of B i alpha a b dosage of A dosage of B x d ii in which a dosage for compound A applied alone b dosage for compound B applied alone OC weight ratio of compound A to compound B in mixture. The dosages used were as follows, the figures being given inKg ha. A refers to cyanazine, and B to chlortoluron.

From these figures, analysis was carried out in two ways. 1 The mean percentage phytotoxicity over the three dosages was calculated.2 The results were subjected to a standard probit analysis to calculate the dosage, in Kg ha required to kill 50 of the test species. This dosage is referred to as the dosage. If a mixture of herbicides A and B act together in an additive way, one would expect the OlD50 values for A and B to be given by the equations i and ii above where a and b are equal to the GID50 s of A and B used alone. If the measured GID50 values are in fact less than the calculated values, the mixture is synergistic. The results of the tests are given in the following Table. Table of Results Example 1Ratio B A photoxicity Measures GID50 Kg ha Calculated values in brackets 23 days 28 days 23 days 28 days B A B A 1 0 17 24 0.36 0.26 3 1 28 33 0.18 0.24 0.06 0.08 0.15 0.18 0.05 0.06 1 1 23 33 0.14 0.15 0.14 0.15 0.09 0.11 0.09 0.11 1 3 33 43 0.05 0.07 0.14 0.20 0.03 0.05 0.10 0.15 0 1 25 33 0.25 0.19 It can be seen from the results that the mixture of cyanazine A and chlortoluron B is indeed synergistic.ExamPle 2 Effect of Cyanazine chlortoluron Mixtures on Crops The experimental technique described in Example 1 was repeated using wheat, Triticum vulgare variety Sappo, and barleyHordeum vulgare, variety Imber. The dosages used were very much higher than those used in the tests on blackgrass, so that reasonably high levels of phytotoxicity, susceptible to accurate assessment, were obtained.
