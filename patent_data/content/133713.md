## Description
Boom brake Slowing down apparatus for a boom or such and the procedure for the manufacture of the apparatus The invention is concerned with an apparatus for the slowing down of the swing of a boom, for instance on board of a vessel, such as a boom, tiller and the like. On board of sailing vessels it regularly happens that, wenn sailing downwind, the wind suddenly comes around to the other side of the sail, as a result of which an undesirable gybe may occur, which can cause considerable damage. Also with unbalanced rudders the tiller can swing from side to side violently as a result of the movement of the waves. Apparatuses for the slowing down of these movements have been known US, 3750612 d Agostino, 07 08 1983 FR, 2449031Chubilleau, 12 09 1980 FR, 2364813 Waelder, 14 04 1978 , all of them exhibiting the disadvantage of being big, heavy and intricate to bandle. The invention aims at presenting an apparatus that is relatively small and light and consequently easy to handle. Furthermore the apparatus is easy to manufacture. The apparatus made according to the invention distinguishes itself by a closed casing with two oval openings, between which a channel included in the casing extends in order to take in a flexible element such as a rope, which is attached to the ship between two points that are at some distance from each other. The apparatus has been applied in such a way that at a swing of a boom or tiller the flexible element is being pulled through the channel, the latter exhibiting a slowing down effect on the flexible element as a result of the friction The channel form may be arbitrary but preferably it is bend over more than 360 . Because of this the flexible element will easily clench itself in the channel, thus increasing the slowing down activity. On the other hand it is possible that the cross section of the channel of the circular form deviates, so that the flexible element clenches itself more or less at a certain haulage. In a preference excecution form the casing consists of at least one hole for the taking in of a fastening element, with the perpendicular of the hole placed vertical on the perpendicular of the two aforementioned oval openings. This measurement achieves that the casing is not pulled in an angle with regard to the fastening pin when the flexible element is tightened, thus preventing wear. Preferably the casing has a principally circular shaped form, the form accommodating the continuous channel. Consequently the casing becomes singularly light. The application of the continuous channel nevertheless provides the security that the flexible element is being carefully guided and cannot become all mixed up. The invention is further concerned with a procedure for the fabrication of the casing for the abovementioned apparatus, the procedure of which distinguishes itself because a tube made of flexible material is bend in the desirable form, over, for instance, at least 360 , next it is applied into a casting mould, after which the mould is filled with a plastic mass. It will be obvious that with this procedure a slowing down apparatus can be accomplished in a particularly cheap way. The invention will be further specified in the following description of the figure of an execution model. The picture shows Fig. 1. a perspective view of the front part of a vessel equipped with a slowing down apparatus according to the invention, Fig. 2. a preference execution form of the casing of the slowing down apparatus, Fig. 3. a bend tube accommodated in the casing according to fig. 2., Fig. 4. a perspective view of the hind part of a vessel, showing the casing of the apparatus as being attached to the boom, Fig. 5 . and 6. each a view comparable to fig. 1. of an alternatively differently attached slowing down apparatus. The cipher 1 denotes the vessel, on which deck casing 2 of the slowing down apparatus, as hereafter specified, has been attached.Through the casing a flexible element has been guided in the shape of a rope 3, which on either side leads to a pully block 5 of boom 6 via two points on deck in the form of pulley 4 which are some distance apart. An end of the rope 3 is attached to the pulley block, whereas the other end leads to the fastening devices 7 for the tightening of rope 3 via a leeward wheel attached to the pulley block. The casing of th to specified in fig. 2. It consists of a pr shaped part of, for instance, synthetic material, which casing is provided with two oval openings 8, that are directed away from each other the hind opening is not shown, but it correspondents with the front opening. Between these oval openings 8 a closed circular shaped channel extends which is formed by an in casing 2 embedded tube 9.Fig. 3 illustrates the winding form of tube 9, where it must be mentioned that the oval ends 10 of the tube coincide with the oval openings 8 of casing 2 and that the perpendicular of the winding form of tube 9 is placed vertical on the perpendicular of the two aforementioned oval openings of the tube.The fabrication of the casing can take place in a simple way by bending tube 9 in advance in the desired form, subsequently bringin it into a mould, not shown here, after which the mould can be filled with the plastic mass, for instance synthetic material. When the mass is applied hole 11 can already be spared for the attachment of a fastening pin 12, for instance the screw pin of fastening 13. It must be noticed that the perpendicular A A of hole 11 is placed vertical on the perpendicular of casing 2, in which the oval openings B are to be found. Rope 3 can be guided into the channel in a simple manner by pushing it into an opening 8 on one side. Due to the symmetrical formation of openings 8 no reaction moment will appear on pin 12 at a certain tension of rope 3. The apparatus works as follows when a gybe arises, as a result of the bellying of the sail, boom 6 will be pulled upwards, block 5 will consequently move away from the deck, which causes the rope to be tightened, the ropepart in the channel formed by tube 9 will fasten itself under the increasement of the friction between the rope and tube 9. During the swing of the boom the rope is pulled through tube 9 which is opposed by the increased friction. Thus the boom s swing is considerably slowed down. The fastening measurements 7 function to tighten rope somewhat in advance at a certain position of boom 6. It is obvious that a similar formation can also be used for a tiller.Fig. 4 shows the possibility of attaching casing 2 of the slowing down apparatus directly to boom 6 by means of fastening 13. In this case one end of rope 3 is permanently attached to a place on the deck of the vessel, whereas the other end is guided via block 14 to the helmsman s place, in which case rope 3 can arbitrarily be tightened in advance and fastened. In this application the rope will not undergo a shift with regard to the vessel, but casing 2 with boom 6 will be dragged along the rope. The slowing down effect remains the same. Fig. 5 and 6 each show a different way to attach the apparatus, which speak for themselves and are not limited. In fig. 5 casing 2 of the slowing down apparatus is joined to the shealing at the front of the mast via fastening 13, whereas in fig. 6 casing 2 of the slowing down apparatus is attached to the foot of the mast. In either case rope 3 is attached to a point on deck of the vessel with one end, then it runs via a conducting element attached to the boom through the slowing down apparatus back to the conducting element on the boom ans via a fasteningpoint on deck to a tightening element at any arbitrary place near the helmsman. The invention is not limited to the above mentioned execution form of casing 2 or attachment possibilities. Thus tube 9 can arbitrarily have more or less windings depending on the slowingdown effect. Due to the use of a closed channel rope 3 will never get mixed up in the windings, as a result of which the slowing down effect remains best and no blockage can arise. Furthermore the oval openings 8 in casing and of course in tube 9 make it possible to attach the rope 3 on the vessel in different angles, to prevent wear of the rope. The apparatus may just as well be applicable on other places than ships.
