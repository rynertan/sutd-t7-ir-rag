# Grooved fastener.

## Abstract
A fastener which includes an unthreaded bolt member having two groups of grooves formed therein is disclosed. All the grooves within each group have the same depth. The group of grooves furthest from the workpiece have a greater depth than the group of grooves adjacent to the workpiece, thus permitting a more uniform load distribution along the shank of the bolt.
