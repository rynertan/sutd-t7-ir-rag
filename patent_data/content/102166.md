# Method for terminating phase matched semirigid coaxial cable.

## Abstract
A method is disclosed for terminating semirigid coaxial cable 12 that is phase matched which is accomplished by cutting a length of coaxial cable 12 to the exact or approximate desired electrical length. A coaxial connector 88 is permanently terminated onto one end of the cable 12 and a phase matching test connector 10 is positioned onto the other end of the cable 12 . The cable 12 is tested to determine if the electrical length of the cable 12 is correct. If it is, the test connector 10 is removed and another coaxial connector 88 is permanently terminated onto the other end of the cable 12 . If the electrical length of the cable 12 is too long, the test connector 10 is removed, the cable 12 is trimmed to the correct length, the test connector 10 is reapplied onto the cable 12 , the cable 12 is retested, and if now correct, the other coaxial connector 98 is permanently terminated onto the table 12 .
