# Printing apparatus.

## Abstract
Printing Apparatus for use with impact sensitive paper has means for mounting the paber as a centinous longitudi nally extending substantially flat sheet to be directly viewed from one face thereof, print head means disposed at a pre determined location on the other face of the sheet, and means for causing the print head means to impact against the said other face along transverse lines at said predetermined loca tion to produce visible printing on the said one face. The printing apparatus may include means for moving the paper longitudinally after a transverse line is printed to permit immediate viewing of the data just printed.
