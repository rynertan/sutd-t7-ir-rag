# Crosslinked, carboxyalkylated and deacetylated derivative of chitin, process for preparation thereof, and use thereof as an adsorbent material.

## Abstract
Chitin, a widely occurring natural material, is con verted into a polymeric substance of amphoteric nature and useful as an adsorbent material, in for example, the separation of sugars and proteins or of mixtures of pro teins, by successive cross linking, carboxyalkylation and deacetylation reactions. The resulting cross linked poly meric substance has a degree of cross linking of 0.01 to 0.3, a degree of carboxyalkylating substitution of 0.1 to 0.9, and a degree of deacetylation of 0.1 to 1.
