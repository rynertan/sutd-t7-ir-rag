# Pulse frequency multiplier.

## Abstract
An input pulse signal A is frequency divided by a flip flop 10 . The frequency divided signal from the flip flop 10 is used to control switching of charging and discharging of a capacitor C so as to generate a triangular wave voltage which has the same period as that of the frequency divided signal B . The triangular wave voltage is supplied to a multiwindow comparator 12 which has a plurality of invert ing voltages so as to generate a plurality of pulse signals within one period of the triangular wave voltage.
