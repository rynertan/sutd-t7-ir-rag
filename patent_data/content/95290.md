## Description
RETREATING COMMINUTED OLEFIN POLYMERIZATION CATALYST WITH A TITKNIb IV COMPO DS AS D an ESTER Background of the Invention Polymerization of alpha olefins, such as ethylene, propylene and butene l, to normally solid, substantially crystalline polymers using catalyst compositions comprising transition metal and organoaluminum compounds is well known.Although many transition metal compounds have been disclosed as useful in such polymerizations, including salts of titanium, vanadium and zirconium, compounds of titanium predominate with tetravalent titanium Ti IV compound typically proving most useful in ethylene polymerization and trivalent titanium Ti III compounds most useful in polymerization of propylene and higher apha oiefins. Various forms of titanium components have been disclosed in both Ti IV and Ti III based compositions including a so called supported titanium component. Supported titanium catalyst components have been disclosed in which titanium eitherTi III or Ti IV is placed onto a metal oxide or metal halide support.One view of an advantage of supported titanium catalyst components is tat in such components catalytically active titanium containing sites are dispersed throughout the supported catalyst composition yielding more efficient use of the titanium content and resulting in higher overall catalytic activity, espe ci ally if based on titanium content. Supported titanium catalyst components have been found most useful in ethylene polymerization such as described in U.S. Patent 3,901,863. Until recently, however, supported titanium catalyst components have not been used substantially in commercial polymerization of propylene or higher alpha olefins due to coproduction of high levels of noncrystalline or amorphous polymeric products. Production of such noncrystalline, amorphous products especially is detrimental in polymerization processes in which such noncrystalline products are not removed by solvent retraction. Examples of nonsolvent processes are gas phase and bulk processes. In gas phase polymerization, solid polymer is formed directly on contact of gaseous monomer with a catalyst while in a bulk process, polymer is formed in a liauid monomer medium. In either process solid polymer advantageously is not treated further with a hydrocarbon solvent to remove noncrystalline material.Even in a slurry process in which noncrystalline material can be removed, production of such noncrystalline material usually is minimized because of its lower economic value. Supported olefin polymerization catalysts have been disclosed in which crystallinity promoting components are incorporated. Such components can be electron donor compounds which are associated with titanium containing support catalyst complexes. Further, preparations of supported olefin polymerization catalysts have been disclosed in which the supported catalyst material is comminuted such as by ball milling in order to increase catalyst activity. An example of such catalyst material is described in U.S. Patent 4,277,370 incorporated by reference herein. However, it has been found that while comminuting such a catalyst component can increase activity, presumably by exposing more active sites, such a comminuted catalyst also can yield increased noncrystalline polymer products as evidenced by increased solubles and extractables. Olefin polymerization catalysts having higher activity and yielding fewer undesirable by products are always desirable. Many supported titanium containing catalyst components which have been comminuted such as by ball milling have been found to be active however, such a comminuted supported catalyst component which also yields low amounts of noncrystalline polymeric by products would be very desirable. A method to produce such a catalyst would be very useful in the olefin poly nerization catalyst art. An important commercial property of olefin polymers such as polypropylene is the morphology of powder product. Morphology is a term describing a combination of physical properties of a batch of polymer particles including average pore diameter, absence of very small particles fines or large particles, and substantial uniformity of particles. One measurement used in evaluating morphology is bulk density. Typically, higher bulk density values are desired such as above about 22 pounds per cubic foot or higher. A catalyst which is active, and yields low nounts of amorphous products and a high bulk density powder would be very desirable. Sun r ary of the Invention A comminuted, supported polymerization catalyst for alpha olefns comprises .R an organoaluminum compound and B a solid titanium containing component formed by 1 ccinuting a solid reaction product comprising a at least one halogen containing compound of tita nium IX b at least one electron donor and c at least one hydrocarbon insoluble, mageslum containing compound and 2 retreating such comminuted product with a at least one halogen containing compound of titanium IV b at least one organic acid ester and c optionally, a chlorocarbon and or a haloalkylchlorosi lane.

Among the mineral acids and anhydrides of sulfur and organometallic chalcogenide derivatives, sulfuric acid, fuming sulfuric acid, chlorosulfonic acid, and hydrogen sulfide are preferred because they lead to the best overall improvements in activities and stereospecificities. Organic acids useful in pretreatment of a magnesiumcontaining component according to this invention are acids containing from.l to about 20 carbon atoms and 1 to about 4 carboxyl groups. Such acids include aliphatic acids of 1 to about 20 carbon atoms halogen , hydroxyl , oxo , alkyl , alkoxy , aryl , and aryloxy substituted aliphatic acids of 1 to about 20 carbon atoms aromatic acids of 7 to about 14 carbon atoms and halogen , hydroxyl , alkyl , alkoxy , aryl , and aryloxy substituted aromatic acids of 7 to about 20 carbon atoms. Monocarboxylic acids are preferred over the polycar boxylic acids. Specific examples of useful aliphatic acids include saturated acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, butyric acid, pivalic acid, valeric acid, glutaric acid, caproic acid, cyclohexanecarboxylic acid, suberic acid, lauric acid, stearic acid, and arachidic acid and unsaturated acids such as acrylic acid, crotonic acid, isocrotonic acid, vinylacetic acid, allylacetic acid, maleic acid, hydrosorbic acid, sorbic acid, undecenoic acid, oleic acid, and stearolic acid.

Organic acid esters useful as pretreatment components according to this invention include alkyl and haloalkyl esters of acids such as are described above wherein the alkyl group or groups contain 1 to about 12 carbon atoms, and aryl and haloaryl esters of such acids wherein the aryl group or groups contain 6 to about 10 carbon atoms. Specific examples of useful organic acid esters include the methyl, chloromthyl, ethyl, chloroethyl, bromoethyl, butyl, hexyl, cyclohexyl, octyl, chlorododecyl, phenyl, chlorophenyl, and naphthyl esters of acids such as are named above. Preferred organic acids and esters are benzoic acid, halobenzoic acids and the alkyl esters thereof wherein the alkyl group contains 1 to about 6 carbon atoms such as methyl benzoate, methyl bromobenzoates, ethyl benzoate, ethyl chlorobenzoates, butyl benzoate, isobutyl benzoate, hexyl benzoate, and cyclohexyl benzoate, as these given good results in terms of activity and stereospecificity and are convenient to use. Mixtures of pretreatment modifiers which are preferred according to this invention are combinations of at least one of the above described mineral acids or anhydrides of sulfur or organcmetallic chalcogenide derivatives with at least one of the above described organic acids or organic acid esters. More preferred combinations are those containing at least one of the preferred sulfur containing modifiers identified above i.e., sulfuric acid, fuming sulfuric acid, chlorosulfonic acid, and hydrogen sulfide and at least one of the preferred organic acids and esters identified above i.e., benzoic acid, halobenzoic acids, and the C1 to about C6 alkyl esters thereof . Best results are obtained through the use of a combination of chlorosulfonic acid and methyl benzoate. The pretreated magnesium containing component is obtained by contacting components comprising at least one magnesium alcoholate and at least one Group II or IIIA metal alkyl. Preferably, at least one of the above described pretreatment modifiers also is employed in preparation of the pretreatment product. The components are employed in amounts such that the atomic ratio of metal in the Group II or IIIA metal alkyl component to metal in the magnesium alcoholate component ranges from about 0.001 1 to about 1 1. Preferably, this ratio ranges from about 0.005 1 to about 0.5 1 as these amounts provide for good improvements in catalyst performance without hindering removal of unreacted Group II or IIIA metal alkyl zrom the reaction product which ultimately forms.In the preferred embodiment of this invention, wherein at least one pretreatment modifier is employed in preparation of the pretreated magnesium containing product, the modifier is employed in an amount which is effective to improve catalyst component performance but not so great as to hinder pretreatment due to formation of excessive amounts of solids on reaction with the Group II or TIBIA metal alkyl pretreatment component. Preferably, this amount ranges from about 0.001 to about 2 moles of pretreatment modifier per mole of Group II or IIIA metal alkyl component. Best results are attained when the molar ratio of pretreatment modifier to metal alkyl component ranges from about 0.005 1 to about 1 1, and particularly from about 0.01 1 to about 0.5 1. According to a particularly preferrred embodiment of the invention wherein the modifier component employed is a mixture of at least one mineral acid or anhydride of sulfur or organometallic chalcogenide derivative and at least one organic acid or ester, it is preferred to employ from about 0.5 to about 20 moles of the organic acid or ester per mole of sulfur containing modifier. More preferably, this ratio ranges from about 1 1 to about 15 1. As indicated above the pretreatment product employed according to this invention is free of unreacted Group II or IIIA metal alkyl and is prepared by contacting the pretreatment components. Although not required, it is preferred to contact the components in the presence of an inert diluent to aid in conductance of heat evolved on reaction of the magnesium alcoholate and metal alkyl components away from the reaction product and further, because in the absence of a diluent the magnesium alcoholate and metal alkyl components typically react to form a sticky mass which can be c..fficult to handle in subsequent preparative manipulations.Although it is preferred to contact the pretreatment components in the presence of an inert diluent, other techniques such as pulverization of magnesium alcoholate in the presence of metal alkyl and, optionally, modifier component or a fluidized bed treatment of solid magnesium alcoholate with Group II or IIIA metal alkyl, and optionally, one or more modifiers also can be employed. Most preferably,Group II or IIIA metal alkyl dissolved in an inert diluent is added to a suspension of magnesium alcoholate in a diluent. Modifier components, when used, canute employed in any convenient form. Diluents suitable for use in pretreatment include hydrocarbons and halogenated derivatives thereof that are substantially inert to the pretreatment components employed and, preferably, are liquid at pretreatment temperatures. It also is contemplated to conduct the pretreatment at elevated pressure so that lower boiling diluents can be used even at higher temperatures. Examples of useful diluents include alkanes such as hexane, cyclohexane, ethylcyclohexane, heptane, octane, nonane, decane, undecane, and so forth aromatics such as xylenes and ethylbenzene and halogenated and hydrogenated aromatics such as chlorobenzene, o dichlorobenzene, tetrahy dronaphthalene, and decahydronaphthalene. Preferred diluents are the alkanes and especially hexane. The sequence in which the pretreatment components are contacted is not critical. When pretreatment is carried out without the use of pretreatment modifier, the magnesium alcoholate and Group II or IIIA metal alkyl components are simply combined. When one or more modifier components are employed, magnesium alcoholate component, Group II or IIIA metal alkyl component, and modifier component can be contacted concurrently or two of the components can be brought together and then the third component added to the result. Best results are attained when the modifier component is added to a solution ofGroup II or IIIA metal alkyl component in a diluent and then the resulting solution is added to the magnesium alcoholate component. Pretreatment according to this invention is carried out at temperatures ranging from about 300 to about 1300C. Preferably, the pretreatment temperature ranges from about 00 to about 600C, with about 100 to about 300C being more preferred from the standpoint of convenience.The time of pretreatment generally ranges from several minutes to several hours, with about 1 to about 10 hours being preferred. When pretreatment is conducted in the presence of an inert diluent, it is desirable to agitate the components during pretreatment to ensure thorough contacting of the components. Following contacting of pretreatment components as described above, unreacted Group II or IIIA metal alkyl component is removed from the reaction product of the pretreatment components to avoid reduction of the titanium component employed in subsequent preparative steps.When pretreatment is conducted in the presence of an inert diluent, the reaction product preferably is separated from the diluent, for example, by filtration or decantation, and unreacted Group II or IIIA metal alkyl is removed therefrom by washing with hexane or another alkane. The above described pretreatment is conducted in the substantial absence of water, oxygen, carbon oxides, and other extraneous materials capable of adversely affecting the performance of the invented catalyst components.Such materials are conveniently excluded by carrying out the pretreatment in the presence of an inert gas such as nitrogen or argon, or by other suitable means. Optionally, all or part of the pretreatment may be conducted in the presence of one or more alpha olefins which, when introduced into the preparative system in gaseous form, can serve to exclude catalyst poisons. The presence of one or more alpha olefins du.ing pretreatment also can result in improved stereospecificity. Useful alpha olefins include ethylene, propylene, butene 1, pentene l, 4 methylpentene 1, hexene 1, and mixtures thereof.Of course, any alpba olefin employed during pretreatment should be of relatively high purity, for example, polymerization grade or higher. Other precautions which aid in excluding extraneous poisons include purification of any diluent to be employed, such as by percolation through molecular sieves and or silica gel prior to use, and drying andjor heating of magnesium alcoholate pretreatment components. As a result of the pretreatment in accordance with this invention, there is obtained a hydrocarbon insoluble, magnesium convain ng pretreatment product which can be reacted with at least one halogen containing titanium IV compound and at least one organic electron donor to form a stereospecific supported catalyst component especially useful in the stereospecific polymerization of alpha olefins of 3 or more carbon atoms. Due to the sensitivity of catalyst components to catalyst poisons such as water, oxygen, and carbon oxides, the catalyst components are prepared in the substantial absence of such materials. Catalyst poisons can be excluded by carrying out the preparation under an atmosphere of an inert gas such as nitrogen or argon, or an atmosphere of alpha olefin as described hereinabove.As noted above, purification of any diluent to be employed also aids in removing poisons from the preparative system. As a result of the above described preparation there is obtained a solid reaction product suitable for use as a catalyst component. Prior to such use, it is desirable to remove incompletely reacted starting materials from the solid reaction product. This is conveniently accomplished by washing the solid, after separation from any preparative diluent, with a suitable solvent, such as a liquid hydrocarbon or chlolvcarbon, preferably within a short time after completion of the preparative reaction because prolonged contact between the catalyst component and unreacted starting materials may adversely affect catalyst component performance. Although not required, the solid reaction product prepared as described herein may be contacted with at least one liquid Lewis acid prior to polymerization.Such Lewis acids useful according to this invention are materials which are liquid at treatment temperatures and have a Lewis acidity high enough to remove impurities such as unreacted starting materials and poorly affixed compounds from the surface of the above described solid reaction product. Preferred Lewis acids include halides of Group III V metals which are in the liquid state at temperatures up to about 1700C. Specific examples of such materials include So13, AlBr3, TiC14, TiBr4, SiC14, Geo41 SnC14, PC13 and SbCl . Preferable Lewis acids are TiC14 and SiC14. Mixtures of Lewis acids can be employed if desired. Although not required, the above described solid reaction product may be washed with an inert liquid hydrocarbon or halogenated hydrocarbon before contact with a Lewis acid. Suitable inert liquids include those identified hereinabove as pretreatment and preparative diluents. If such a wash is conducted it is preferred to substantially remove the inert liquid prior to contacting the washed solid with Lewis acid. The liquid Lewis acid employed according to the invention preferably is used neat although it also is contemplated to employ liquid Lewis acid diluted with up to about 40 vol. of an inert solvent therefor. Suitable solvents include those materials useful as diluents in preparation of pretreatment product and supported catalyst component as described hereinabove. Of course, any such solvent should be purified prior to use. The amount of Lewis acid used, whether neat or diluted, is not critical. From a pratical stAndpoint, however, the amount should be great enough to provide a high degree of contact between the solid and liquid, but not so great as to waste the Lewis acid or require excessively large vessels for the contacting. Most preferably, from about 3 to about 10 milliliters of Lexis acid are used for each gram of solid to be treated. Temperature in the liquid Lewis acid contacting step is at least high enough to avoid solidification of theLewis acid employed, but not so high as to adversely affect ultimate catalyst component performance. Preferred temperatures range from about OC to about 1700C.When TiC14 is used as the Lewis acid, temperatures of about 200 to about 1350C are preferred as the same result in desirable improvements in catalytic performance while avoiding waste of TiC14 through vaporization thereof and exposure of catalyst components to conditions more severe than necessary. The time of contact with liquid Lewis acid is not critical and generally ranges from several minutes to several hours. It is desirable to agitate the solid andLewis acid during at least a substantial portion of this time to ensure a high degree of contact. Preferred contact times range from 1 to about 30 minutes as the same yield the desired improvements without occupying prepara tion equipment for undesirably lengthy periods of time. As in preparation of the solid reaction product, theLewis acid contacting step according to this invention is conducted in the substantial absence of oxygen, water, carbon oxides and extraneous catalyst poisons. Such materials are excluded by any convenient manner as described hereinabove. Following contacting with Lewis acid, solids are allowed to settle and supernatant is removed therefrom such as by filtration or decantation. One or more additional Lewis acid contacting steps can be carried out with the same or different Lewis acid. In addition, a series of alternating Lexis acid and inert liquid hydrocarbon or halogenated hydrocarbon wastes can be conducted if desired. Prior to use in the polymerization of alpha olefins, the catalyst components used in this invention are mechanically activated by comminution. Mechanical activation improves the polymerization performance of the invented catalyst components, whether or not treated withLewis acid, in terms of both activity. and susceptibility to modification by crystallinity promoting modifiers however, comminution typically forms a catalyst component which yields increased noncrystalline products. The preferred technique for mechanically activating the invented catalyst components is dry ball milling, that is, ballmilling in substantial absence of inert diluent. However, good results also can be obtained by ball milling in the presence of a minor amount of an inert diluent such as hexane or another alkane, as well as by other techniques.The above described catalyst components can be comminuted in the presence of one or more organic electron donors of the general type employed in preparation of the catalyst components. Techniques of comminution by ball milling generally are known in the art.Typically, titanium containing catalyst component and hard,.nonreactive balls, such as steel or burundum balls, are placed in a closed container which is agitated usually by rolling, shaking or rocking. Such comminution is continued for a few hours up to several days, typically about 12 to about 36 hours, until the catalyst component is ground to a desired particle size typically about 5 to about 50 microns. Since mechanical action of comminution can cause a temperature increase in the comminuting mixture, care should be taken to keep the temperature below the decomposition temperature of the catalyst component. Typically, the comminuting mixture should be kept at below about 500C. Optimum comminution techniques for a specific catalyst componen can be determined b routine experimentation. Optimum polymerization performance is attained by treating with Lewis acid and then mechanically activating. Treatment of mechanically activated catalyst component with Lewis acid alone is not preferred as it may result in agglomeration of the component and inferior polymerization performance. According to one aspect of this invention comminuted titanium containing catalyst component is retreated by contact with a halide containing titanium IV compound and a chlorocarbon and an ester. According to another aspect of this invention comminuted titanium containing catalyst component is retreated by contact with a halide containing titanium IV compound and an organochlorosilane and an ester.

Comminuted catalyst may be prepolymerized with an alpha olefin before use as a polymerization catalyst component. In prepolymerization comminuted catalyst and an organoaluminum compound co catalyst such as triethylaluminum are contacted with an alpha olefin such as propyiene under polymerization conditions, preferably in the presence f a modifier such as methyl p toluate and in an inert hydrocarbon such as hexane. Typically, the polymer catalyst weight ratio of the resulting prepolymerized component is about 0.1 1 to about 20 1.

The above described catalysts are useful in polymerization of alpha olefins such as ethylene and propylene, and are most useful in stereospecific polymerization of alpha olefins containing 3 or more carbon atoms such as propylene, butene 1, pentene 1, 4 methylpentene 1, and hexene l, as well as mixtures thereof and mixtures thereof with ethylene. The invented catalysts are particularly effective in the stereospecific polymerization of propylene or mixtures thereof with up to about 20 mole ethylene or a higher alpha olefin. Propylene homopolymerization is most preferred. According to the invention, highly crystalline polyalpha olefins are prepared by contacting at least one alpha olefin with the above described catalyst compositions under polymerizing conditions.Such conditions include polymerization temperature and time, monomer pressure, avoidance of contamination of catalyst, choice of polymerization medium in slurry processes, the use of additives to control polymer molecular weights, and other conditions well known to persons of skill in the art. Slurry, bulk, and vapor phase polymerization processes are contemplated herein. The amount of catalyst to be employed varies depending on choice of polymerization technique, reactor size, monomer to be polymerized, and other factors known to persons of skill in the art, and can be determined on the basis of the examples appearing hereinafter. Irrespective of the polymerization process employed, polymerization should be carried out at temperatures sufficiently high to ensure treasonable polymeriztion rates and avoid unduly long reactor residence times, but not so high as to result in the production of unreasonably high levels of stereorandom products due to excessively rapid polymerization rates. Generally, temperatures range from about 0 to about 1200C with about 200 to about 950C being preferred from the standpoint of attaining good catalyst performance and high production rates. More preferably, polymerization according to this invention is carried out at temperatures ranging from about 50 to about 800C. Alpha olefin polymerization according to this invention is carried out at monomer pressures of about atmospheric or above. Generally, monomer pressures range from about 20 to about 600 psi, although in vapor phase polymerizations, monomer pressures should not exceed the vapor pressure at the polymerization temperature of the alphaolefin to be polymerized. The polymerization time is not critical and will generally range from about 1 2 to several hours in batch processes. Polymerization times ranging from about 1 to about 4 hours are typical in autoclave type reactions.In slurry processes, the polymerization time can be regu lated as desired. Polymerization times ranging from about 1 2 to several hours are generally sufficient in continuous slurry processes. Diluents suitable for use in slurry polymerization processes include alkanes and cycloalkanes such as pentane, hexane, heptane, n octane, isooctane, cyclohxane, and methyicyclohexane alkylaromatics such as toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene, isopropylbenzene, ethyl toluene, n propyl benzene, diethylbenzenes, and mono and dialkylnaphthalenes halogenated and hydrogenated aromatics such as chlorobenzene, chloronaphthalene, ortho dichlorobenzene, tetrahydronaphthalene, decahydronaphthalene high molecular weight liquid paraffins or mixtures thereof, and other well known diluents. It often is desirable to purify the polymerization medium prior to use such as by distillation, percolation through molecular sieves, contacting with a compound such as an alkylaluminum compound capable of removing trace impurities, or by other suitable means.Examples of gas phase polymerization processes in which the catalyst of this invention is useful are described in U.S. Patents 3,957,448 3,965,083 3,971,768 3,972,611 4,129,701 4,101,289 3,652,527 and 4,003,712. Irrespective of polymerization technique, polymerization is carried out under conditions that exclude oxygen, water, and other materials that act as catalyst poisons. Typically, no special precautions need be taken to exclude such materials because a positive pressure of monomer gas commonly exists within the reactor. Also, according to this invention, polymerization can be carried out in the presence of additives to control polymer molecular weights. Hydrogen is typically employed for this purpose in a manner well known to persons of skill in the art. Upon completion of polymerization, or when it is desired to terminate polymerization or deactivate the catalysts of this invention, the catalyst can be con tacted with water, alcohols, acetone, or other suitable catalyst deactivators in a manner known to persons of skill in the art. The products produced in accordance with the process of this invention are normally solid, predominantly isotactic polyalpha olefins. Polymer yields are sufficiently high relative to the amount of catalyst employed so that useful products can be obtained without separation of catalyst residues. Further, levels of stereorandom by products are sufficiently low so that useful products can be obtained without separation thereof. The polymeric products produced in the presence of the invented catalysts can be fabricated into useful articles by extrusion, injection molding, and other common techniques. The following examples illustrate but do not limit the described invention. Examples I IV A Preparation of Pretreated Magnesium containingComponent Into a one liter flask equipped with magnetic stirrer and maintained under nitrogen in a drybox were added 100 milliliters of dry n hexane and 11.4 grams of anhydrous magnesium ethoxide obtained from DynamitNobel at ambient temperature. The resulting suspension was stirred and 20 milliliters of a mixture formed by combining 60 milliliters of a 25 wt. solution of triethylaluminum TEA in dry n hexane, 0.03 milliliter of chlorosulfonic acid and 0.2 milliliter of methyl benzoate were added dropwise to the stirred suspension over a period of about 1 4 hour at ambient temperature. Stirring was continued for one hour following completion of the addition of TEA solution and then the solid reaction product was allowed to settle.The supernatant then was decanted and the solid was washed twice with 125 milliliter portions of dry n hexane. The resulting pretreatment product then was suspended in 450 millili ters n nonane. The atomic ratio of aluminum to magnesium employed in preparation of the pretreatment product was 0.15 1. B Preparation of Supported Catalyst Component Into a one liter flask equipped as in A were added dropwise with stirring the suspension of pretreatment product prepared in A and 100 milliliters of titanium tetrachloride at ambient temperature. To the resulting mixture there was added dropwise a solution of 2.5 milliliters of ethyl benoate in 50 milliliters n nonane over a period of about 1 4 hour at ambient temperature with stirring. After addition of the ethyl benzoate solution was completed, the resulting mixture was heated to 1350 to 1400C, stirred at this temperature for 1 1 2 hours, and then allowed to cool to about 1150 to 1200C.The supernatant then was decanted and the remaining solid was washed four times with 150 milliliter portions cf dry n hexane. After the final wash, the solid was separated from the liquid by filtration and dried. C Comminution of Supported Catalyst Component A portion of the solid catalyst component prepared in B and 80 stainless steel balls having a diameter of 10 millimeters were placed in a Roalox, burundum fortified porcelain mill jar manufactured by A. Daigger Company having a capacity of 1 4 quart about 280 milliliters and milled in a rotary ball mill manufactured byPaul 0. Abbe, Inc., motor speed 1725 rpm for 16 hours at ambient temperature under an atmosphere of dry nitrogen. The solid was sieved to remove all particles which could not pass through a 200 mesh U.S. SieveSeries sieve. The atomic ratio of titanium employed in B to magnesium employed in A was 4.6 1 and the ratio of ethyl benzoate to titanium was 0.03 mole per gram atom. D Retreatment of Comminuted Catalyst Component A 7.7 gram portion of the solid obtained from C was mixed with 75.9 milliliters of titanium tetrachloride and 75.9 milliliters of carbon tetrachloride spectro grade . After 2.07 milliliters of ethyl benzoate were added dropwise to this mixture with stirring, the resulting suspension was heated to 950C for 1.5 hours while stirring. After solid product was allowed to settle, supernatant liquid was removed by decantation and the residue washed four times with 50 milliliter portions of n hexane. The remaining solid was suspended in 75 milliliters of hexane. E Propylene Polymerization A series of bulk propylene polymerizations were conducted using aliquots of titanium containing catalyst components prepared above. Triethylaluminum TEA , ethyl benzoate EB , ethyl anisate EA and 0.021 gram of titanium containing catalyst component were combined in a drybox under nitrogen and flushed into a two liter Parr reactor in 300 milliliters of propylene. After an additional 1000 milliliters of propylene and 10 psig of hydrogen were charged to the reactor, the reactor was closed and polymerization conducted at 710C for two hours. After the reactor was cooled and vented, the resulting solid polymer was air dried overnight and then weighed. Results are shown in Table I.
