# Ferroelectric liquid crystal cell.

## Abstract
Orientation control films 4 are coated and rubbed on a pair of transparent substrates 2 on the side contiguous to the ferroelectric liquid crystal layer 1 for aligning molecules thereof. The film 4 is made of a polyimide polymer prepared by ring closure by heating and dehydrating of a polyamic acid which is synthesized by condensing pyromelli tic dianhydride with 4,4 diaminoterphenyl. A contrast ratio of the ferroelectric liquid crystal element is improved while keeping a high responsibility characteristics of the ferroelec tric liquid crystal materials.
