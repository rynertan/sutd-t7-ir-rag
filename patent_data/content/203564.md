# A method and a device for generating heat energy and oscillation energy.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method of and a device for si multaneously generating heat energy and oscillation en ergy. In the method heat is generated by induction heating and oscillations are created by means of at least piezoelec tric elements. Previously a resonance circuit formed by a series connection of an inductive component and a capaci tive, piezoelectric component has been used for the genera tion of oscillations only. A disadvantage of this kind of cir cuit has been that the circuit is difficult to control on account of the narrow resonance region of the piezoelectric ele ment. This advantage is avoided in the solution according to the invention in such manner that one and the same reso nance circuit L, C formed by a series connection of an in ductive and a capacitive element generates both heat ener gy and oascillation energy.
