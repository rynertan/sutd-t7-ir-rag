# Apparatus for admixing a gas to a liquid, in particular for admixing oxygen to polluted water.

## Abstract
The apparatus comprises a vertical tubular column 2 having a lower inlet conected to a pump P and an upper outlet, a deflector 20 of enverted cone shape and extending through the outlet coaxially with the column 2 , a threaded shank 16 rigid with the deflector 20 for adjusting the axial position thereof relatively to the column 2 and a laminating plate 7 coaxially located above the deflector 20 and provided with a central opening 9 communicating with an axial gas intake conduit 11 . Thus a mixing apparatus is provided, for admixing oxygen to polluted water which is both effective to enrich water with oxygen an stir water and the slurries together, while affording the possibility of adjusting the admitted air amount and the stirring characteristics of water and the slurries.
