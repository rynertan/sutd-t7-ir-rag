# Silver plating process, and solution for use therein.

## Abstract
An aqueous electrolyte solution for electrodepositing silver, comprising at least about 15 g l of silver as alkali silver cyanide, 10 g l of free cyanide or less, and a mercaptan compound in a sufficient amount to eliminate or effectively reduce immersion plating of the silver onto the substrate. The invention also includes the treatment of the subs trate with a mercaptan compound and electroplating silver thereover with a silver cyanide plating solution containing 10 g l of free cyanide or less.
