# IMPROVED EEPROM CELL AND METHOD OF FABRICATION

## Abstract
An integrated circuit EEPROM cell having a reduced aspect ratio and the method of fabrication is disclosed. The layout and method of fabrication results in a self aligned EPROM channel, an improved coupling ratio, and a reduction in required substrate area. The cell is slightly widened and the connection junction and tunneling junction are restructured in order to shrink the length of the cell and achieve the reduced aspect ratio.
