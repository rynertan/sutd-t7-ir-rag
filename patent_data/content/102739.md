# Zoom lens operating mechanisms.

## Abstract
A zoom lens operating mechanism comprises a station ary cylinder 1 , an operating ring 8 rotatably mounted on the stationary cylinder 1 , a cam cylinder 7 rotatably mounted within the stationary cylinder 1 and coupled to the operating ring 8 for rotation therewith, at least one lens group 3, 4 coupled to the cam cylinder 7 so as to be movable within a zoom range as the operating ring 8 is rotated within a first angular range and within a close up range as the operating ring 8 is rotated within a second angular range, a guide arrangement formed in the stationary cylinder 1 , and an operating member 9 mounted on the operating ring 8 and cooperating with the guide arrange ment to define the first and second angular ranges. The guide arrangement comprises contiguous first and second guide grooves 1b, 1d with a stop 1c at the junction therebetween, and the operating member 9 is rotatable relative to the operating ring 8 and includes a locking device 17 extendable into the first and second guide grooves 1b, 1d such that upon rotation of the operating ring 8 by the operating member 9 through the first range, the locking device 17 moves along the first guide groove 1b and is locked at the stop 1c , and upon rotation of the operating member 9 the locking device 17 is released from the stop 1c and the locking device 17 can then move along the second guide groove 1d so that the operating ring 8 is rotatable within the second range.
