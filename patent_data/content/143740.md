# process and device for small sized control of the work stations of an automatic machine tool.

## Abstract
The process makes possible the programming of each work unit of an automatic machine tool by the operator as signed to the machine on the basis of immediate working requirements which can be duly evaluated by him, respon ding, in his own language, to a series of requests that appear on a screen. On the basis of the replies given to him, a second elec tronic memory is programmed by a keyboard which makes the work stations operate in the requested mode. The device for driving the work unit comprises a step per motor 1 that drives a nut 2 controlling, by a tube 4 , valves 7 and 8 for intake and discharge of a fluid in the hydraulic cylinder 10 for driving the work unit, said piston 11 is solid with a screw 9 screwing in said nut 2 and prevents it from rotating, thus achieving a mechanical re troaction that makes the control independent of the variation of the viscosity of the fluid by the effect of the temperature.

## Description
Process and device for small sized control of the work stations of an automatic machine toolThis invention has as its object a process and device for small sized control of the work stations of an automatic machine tool, avoiding the need to change cams or gears to vary the working speed and the movements of the various tools by programming electronic memories.The process is characterized by the characterizing part of claim 1.The device for embodying the process is characterized by the characterizing part of claim 2.For greater clarity the accompanying drawing represents a preferred nonlimiting embodiment of the device, object of the invention. Fig. 1 represents the complete device. Fig. 2 represents it diagrammatically for a better understanding. Fig. 3 and 4 represent details.It comprises stepper motor 1 that controls, by gears 5 and 6, nut 2 in which is screwed screw 9 rigidly connected to piston 11 that can slide in hydraulic cylinder 10. Piston 11 in turn is connected to a work station of the automatic machine tool.Given the connection existing between piston 11 and screw 9, the latter cannot rotate but can move only laterally when the piston moves.Said screw 9 and the relative nut exhibit a thread, prefe rably of trapezoidal cross section, given the great precision required, but can be of any type, for example having ball movement, i.e., with the threads of the screw made of a succession of balls to reduce friction.Nut 2 in turn is rigidly connected to a tube 4 provided with a checking appendix 4 and two flanges 4 and 4 , the first of which, 4 , controls valve 7 for intake of the fluid in cylinder 10, the second, 4 , controls valve 8 for discharge of said fluid.The entire unit is so arranged that opening of said intake valve 7, due to the rotation of stepper motor 1 in one direction, governs the intake of the fluid in cylinder 10 with passage in direction PA and the consequent movement of piston 11 for controlling the work unit and therefore the movement of screw 9 in the opposite direction with respect to that of the movement of tube 4. Movement of tube 4 and therefore of valve 7 occurs as a function of the resultant between the movement of nut 2 due to the rotation of stepper motor 1 and that of piston 11. Therefore, it is possible in this way automatically to regulate the position of valves 7 and 8 as an exact function of the programmed working speed.Doubly inclined appendix 4 , with the cooperation of tappet 13 and electric contacts 3, makes possible the synchronization explained above.The mechanical synchronization of the programmed movement speed of valves 7 and 8 further makes the device independent of the viscosity of the fluid, generally oil, which goes through valves 7 and 8, a viscosity that can vary with the variation of the temperature. The stepper motor is provided with a handwheel 15, which can be operated by hand to allow manual adjustment of the position of each work station.Valves 7 and 8 can, for example, by cylindrical fig. 1 , conical fig. 4 , spherical fig. 3 or any other known shape.But the cylindrical type valves, shown in fig. 1, are preferable because they allow circulation of the fluid in both directions, show less wear in comparison with the conical type if working along a generatrix and further offer the possibility of an easy boring of their seat which is also cylindrical.It is provided that cylinder 10 can also be single act i on, although in any case, it is preferable that it functions with double action as explained.
