# PROCESS FOR PRODUCING L ASPARTIC ACID

## Abstract
A process for producing L aspartic acid which comprises contacting a a culture of a mutant of the genus Escherichia having high aspartase activity which has derived from a parent strain having aspartase activity and can grow in a medium containing L aspartic acid either as a sole nitrogen source or as sole car bon and nitrogen sources b microbial cells collected from the culture or c a processed material of the microbial cells, with fumar ic acid and ammonia to produce L aspartic acid and then col lecting L aspartic acid thus produced.
