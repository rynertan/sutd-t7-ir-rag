# Para selective and beta selective crystallized glass zeolite alkylation catalyst.

## Abstract
There are provided crystallized borosilicate glass zeolite catalysts which are para selective in the alkylation of benzene and derivatives thereof and beta selective in the alkylation of naphthalene and derivatives thereof. There is provided a process for the production of such catalysts wherein a borosilicate type glass is reacted with a zeolite synthesis template. There is also provided a selective alkylation process for the alkylation of benzene and its derivatives and of naphthalene and its derivatives wherein these are reacted with an alkylation agent in the presence of such catalyst.
