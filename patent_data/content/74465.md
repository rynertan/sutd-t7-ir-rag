And Figure 2 is a perspective view partially cut away, of a magneto optic structure which can be used in the fabrication of the interferometer gyroscope of Figure 1. DETAILED OESCRIPTION OF THE PRErCRRED EMBODIMENTSWith reference now to Figure 1 an interferometer gyroscope 10 is presented. including a source 11 of substantially monochromatic, linearly polarized, electromagnetic radiation. The source 11 may be a true laser or simply a source of optical or near optical electromagnetic radiation emitting in a suitably narrow band of frequencies. This radiation source is at least approximately collimated, and is passed through a linear polarizer 12, which passes only radiation polarized with its electric vector in the plane of the diagram. In some true lasers this polarizing means may be a part of the laser. The polarized radiatfon is then passed through a first beam splitter means, 13. which sends a small part of the radiation to a photo detector 15. the functions of which will be described later. The bulk of the radiation, passing the beam splitter 13 is passed to a second beam splitter 18 which divides the radiation power into two equal parts and directs then toward two quarter wave plates 19 and 20 respectively.The radiation reaching the quarter wave plate 19 is converted to a right hand circular polarized radiation which is then concentrated on the end 22 of an optical fiber 23. by a lens means or combination of lenses 26. This radiation then travels along the optical fiber waveguide coil 23 and circulates around same in a clockwise direction, and will hereafter be referred to as the clockwise beam. Similarly, the radiation reaching quarter wave plate means 20 from the beam splitter 18 is converted to right hand circular polarized radiation ant is concentrated on the end 28 of the optical fiber means 23 by a lens means or combination of lenses 29. This radiation then travels along the optical fiber waveguide coil 23 and circulates around same in a counterclockwise direction, and will hereafter be referred to as the counterclockwise beam. The clockwise beam exits the fiber optic means at end 28, and its power is collected by the lens 29 which relays it to the quarter wave plate means 20, which, in turn, converts its right hand circular state of polarization to linear polarization with the electric vector in the plane of the diagram. This radiation then reenters the beam splitter 18 where its power is divided into two equal parts. One part is directed back toward the laser 11 and beam splitter means 13, and the second part is directed toward a photodetector 32. Similarly, the counterclock ise bean exits the fiber optic 23 at end 22 and its power is collected by the lens 26. which relays it to the quarter wave plate 19. which converts its righthand circular polarization to linear polarization with the electric vector in the plane of the figure. This radiation then reenters the beamsplitter 18 which divides its power into two equal parts. One part is directed back toward the laser 11 and bea splitter means 13, and the second part is directed toward the photo detector 32 .The radiation from the clockwise and counterclockwise beans are collinear as they falT on the photo detector 32. where they interfere and cause fringes. The photo detector 32 may be equipped with a suitable spatial filter not shown to enhance its ability to detect changes in fringe location or intensity, as the phase shift between the two beams is altered by the modulating means to be described below. With appropriate design of the beamsplitter 18.which should equally transmit and reflect approximately 50 percent of the radiant energy falling on it. there will be an initial phase shift of 1 radians, due to the fact that the clockwise bean has been reflected twice, while the counterclockwise beam has been transmitted twice in addition to any non reciprocal phase shift derived from Sagnac or magneto optic effects. The shape and format of these fringes is determined by certain geometric adjustment considerations. For the present purpose they may be presumed to be circular as in Newton s rings or as produced by a Fabry Perot interferometer. The current produced by the photo detector 32 is typically of the forum EMI4.1 where id2 detector current kd2 is a constant pe liar to the detector and its spatial filter Pc 2 power in the clockwise beam falling on the detector Pcc2 power in the counterclockwise beam falling on the detector w phase shift derived from Sagnac and magneto optics effects. The phase shift , arses from three sources s mo m 2 where 6 is the phase shift due to the Sagnac effect, o , is the phase sh ft due to the magneto optic effect and M is the dither phase shift used in the modulation process associated with the feed back loop which electronically balances P4 to balance S swithin the operattng frequency bandwidth of the gyroscope of this invention. t is also magneto optically derived. The radiation froc the clockwise and counterclockwise beams that falls on beamsplitter 13 is essentially 50 percent reflected onto photo detector 35, while the other approximately 50 percent is transmitted back toward the laser 11 where it serves no useful purposc. The radiation which does fall on photo detector 35 forms another set of interference fringes which are corplenentary to the set falling on photo detector 32. The phase shift between the two beams falling on photo detector 32 is just since the two interfering beans have identically the same number of reflections as well as the same number of tr3ns missions between their separation at beanisplitter 18 and their recu bination. The current produced by the photodector 35 is typically of the form EMI5.1 where Rdl I detector current kdl is a constant peculiar to the detector and its spatial filter pcwl a power frol the clockwise beam falling on the detector pccl power from the counterclockwise bean failing on the detector.A third signal feeding into amplifier 37 is id3 which is a sample of the incident power of the laser 11 which may be used to make the d.c. portion of the output current of amplifier 37 independent of fluctuations in laser power output or of the electromagnetic radiation source.One end of the coil 45 is connected to a current to frequency converter 48 of the type which can generate a frequency signal indicative of both the angular rate of rotation and the sense, or direction, of the rotation. One such current to frequency converter is taught in U. S. Patent 4,112.428 to A. K. Dorsman, assigned to the assignee hereof, and incorporated herein by reference. The output of the amplifier 37 is thus connected to a phase sensitive demodulator 38 together with a signal 39, below described. The output of the phase sensitive demodulator 38 is directed to an irtegrator 40 which produces an electrical output amplified by an amplifier 42 and connected to an electrical coil 45 encircling the optical fiber coil 23.The coil 45 is connected at its other end to a current to frequency converter 48 to produce a pulse output 50 representative of the current to within the coil 45 which, as will be described below, is relatable to the angular rate of rotation of the gyroscope. In addition an amplifier 52 receives the signal 39 and applies it via a capacitor 53 to a coil 55, also encircling the optical fiber coil 23. The Sagnec effect is a relativistic phenomenon in which the time of propagation around a closed circuit is different in clockwise and counterclockwise directions.This time difference, t, is described by EMI6.1 where co is the velocity of light in a vacuum, .fiL is the vector angular velocfty of the coordinate system attached to the apparatus with respect to inertial space and A is the vector area swept out by the complete closed path going in one direction i.e., clockwise . This effect is sometimes loosely described as coordinate frame dragging. It is universal in character and is not restricted to electromagnetic radiation. The same numerical value would be obtained for any means of propagation the value of the Sagnac tiae difference is not dependent upon the medium or propagation weans mechanical, electrical or whatever .The velocity of light in vacuum enters into this equation as a geometro gravitational constant from the theory of relativity and does not refer to the actual velocity of propagation. The Sagnac time difference is entirely a property of the rotating coordinate systems. If the medium of propagation is reciprocal l.e., like states of polarization are propagated in exactly opposite directions with equal speed and the medium is at rest relative to the beamsplitter 18, no further difference in propagation time in the two directions around the fiber would occur. If the fiber were in motion relative to the beamsplitter 18, a correction for the classical Fresnel Fisseau drag effect would be required. However, in this embodiment, there is no relative potion between the beamsplitter 18 and the fiber 23. In this embodiment, in addition, the fiber 23 is intentionally made non reciprocal by applying a magnetic field as will be described below. In order to.get the Sagnac phase difference 5 from Atc we find EMI6.2 wheres is the frequency of tne electromagnetic radiation or, since co v 6 where is the wavelength in vacuum of the electromagnetic radiation, we may write EMI6.3 which Is the expression usually quoted in the literature, The phase shift mo appearing in Equation 4 is derived by the classical Faraday effect, a non reciprocal phenomenon, which produces opposite effects upon radiation in a given state of polarization according to the direction of travel in the propagatioa medium, in this case the optical fiber 23.In this circumstance the existence of a magnetic field, denoted by the vector it along an element of path length ds causes the right hand circular polarization going in,say,the counterclockwise direction to propagate faster than the right hand circular polarization propagating in the clockwise direction along the fiber. The net phase shift effect over the length of the fiber is given by EMI7.1 where the constant. V, is the Verdet constant of the medi . For fused silica, for example, which many high quality optical fibers have as a core, the value of V is approximately 3.52 radians weber meter or 4.46 x 10 6 radians ampers for electromagnetic radiation of wavelength 0.6328 micron at a temperature of 300 Celslus. The value of V depends upon the medium, the wavelength, and the temperature. The tine integral in Equation 7 may be converted to a surface integral using Stokes theorem to yield EMI7.2 where dA is the vector clement of area swept out by the optical path and the integration is carried out over the entire closed optical path in one direction counting each separate turn as separate and adding to the net result. Maxwell s equations for the electromagnetic field require EMI7.3 where i is the vector current density and D is the electric displacement. For the slowly varying fields contemplated for X, the quantity bt is negligible. Thus Equation 8 may be put into the form EMI8.1 If every turn ot the output coil carrying the current, lo, passes through every turn of the optical fiber coil, the value of this integral yields the result mo 2Ni MfVio 12 where Nf is the number of turns in the fiber coil and Mi is the number of turns 0 in the output coil.It is an intereediate object of this invention to automatically adjust by feed back means the output current, io, to secure the equality of s and mo and thus obtain the output current given by the equation, as will be explained later EMI8.2 m implementing this feed back means, a dither or modulation process is employed which gencrates the term m in Equation 2 . The second coil 55 is also wrapped toroidally around the fiber optic coil and contains Ni turns through which is passed a sinusoidal current, ii , and i Im sin mt 14 derived from a fixed frequency oscillator not shown and amplifier 52.Thus, the same Faraday effect process as described above leads to 2VNfH Imsin mt 1 5 A capacitor 53 is included in series with modulation current im to block any direct current which would cause a gyro bias error. If the current gains through the amplifier 37. for the photo detector signals idl, 102. and id3 are respectively k1, k2, and k3, the output current into the demodulator 38 is id given by iD kl idl k2 id2 k3 id3 16 When m from Equation 15 is substituted into Equation 2 and this result applied to Equations 1 , 3 , and 16 we find iD k kd1 pcc1 pcw1 k2kd2 pcc2 pcw2 k3i3 2 k kd1 pcc1 pcw1 k2kd2 pcc2 pcw2 cos s mo cos kmsin mt sin s mo sin kmsin mt which,when expanded into harmonics of M,becomes iD k1d1 pcc1 pcw1 k2kd2 pcc2 pcw2 k3i3 2 k1kd1 pcc1 pcw1 k2kd2 pcc2 pcw2 Jo k cos s mo 4 k1kd1 pcc1 pcw1 k2kd2 pcc2 pcw2 . 17 EMI9.1 where the modulation index. km. is given by 2V fNimIm 18 and Jq km denotes the usual Bessel functions of the first kind and integer order m q, of the modulation index familiar to the art of phase and frequency modulation. This amplified signal, iD, is then synchronously demodulated against the modulation frequency, by the phase sensitive demodulator 38. The direct current and low frequency signals from the phase sensitive demodulator 38 are applied to an integrator 40 and then are further amplified by the low pass amplifier 42, to obtain the output current it which closes the feed back path.If kG is the total current gain in the process from the input to PSD to the output of amplifier 42. then the resulting output cL.rent, io, is given by io 4kG k1kd1 pcc1 pcw1 k2kd2 pcc2 pcw2 J km sin s mo or since s mo is small oo 4kG k1kd1 pcc1 pcw1 k2kd2 pcc2 pcw2 J km s mo 19 there the phase angles are assured in radians. Eliminating s and no in this Equation with Equations 7 and 12 one finds EMI10.1 where the feed back loop gain, , is given by EMI10.2 By making 1, Equation 13 is secured. The design of the amplifiers must be accomplished to yield a stable feed back system as practiced in the well developed art of servo mechanlsrs and controllers. The precise details are unimportant to the basic concept of this invention except that an integrator must be included in order to get adequate performance of the feed back system. In any event, the condition 1 can only be maintained over a limited band of frequencies.This establishes a frequency bandwidth for the gyro which has implications for the dynamic response of the gyro and for the noise appearing in the gyro output. The dynamic response may be tailored to a specific application by suitable design of the feed back system, and the output current, io, is proportional to the component of angular velocity parallel to the net vector area, A, swept out by the fiber optical path, within this frequency bandwidth.So called single mode optical fibers such as contemplated here are not perfectly ideal.An ideal single mode optical fiber would support two orthogonal states of polarization going in one direction along the fiber with the same phase veloolty. It would also support two equivalent orthogonal states of polarization going in the opposite direction with the same phase velocities. A non ideal single mode fiber in general supports two orthogonal states of polarization propagated in one direction but with slightly different phase velocities. Further, the orthogonal states and phase velocities differ from point to point along the fiber. This near degenerate situation leads to unsatisfactory propagation within the fiber, which is sometimes referred to as polarization noise.A definite state of polarization cannot be maintained over a long length of fiber.The modulation scheme of this invention partially circumvents this polarization noise difficulty by removing the degeneracy, except near the times at which the modulation current, im, is near zero. When im is not small the fiber supports right and left circular polarized modes of propagation going In the same direction but with significantly different phase velocities due to the Faraday effect. This reduces the polariza tion nolse over most of the modulation cycle. This circumvention may be improved by using a nuch larger modulation index, km , andlor by using square wave modulatfon rather than sine wave modulation. A second method of removing the near degeneracy and thus reducing the polarization noise is to impart to the fiber a torsional twist about its length as it is wound on its supporting coil form. A large amount of such twist has the effect of causinn the fiber again to support right and left hand polarization states propagated in the same direction but with significantly different phase velocities. Use of this phenomenon is reported by Pashleigh and Ulrich in Applied Phvsics Letters, June 1, 1979, in an particle entitled Magneto Optic Current Sensing ulth Birefringent Fibers. It is contemplated that such a twisted fiber will be used in the higher accuracy embodiments of this invention.Returning flow to Flgure 1. an explanation of the beamsplitter, 13, and the photodetector 15 follows. The laser 11 typically will have some amplitude modulation intrinsic to . s output.The radiation falling on the phototdetectors 32 and 35 has a portion of po er,unmodulated by the frequency 5 falling on it which will be modulated by the amplitude modulation of the laser ll. The beamsplitter 13 and photodetector 15 sarp.le a small part of the laser power, and the resulting current is coupled in phase opposition to the outputs of photodetectors 32 and 35 so as to compensate the effect of amplitude modulation of the laser beam, ano thus lower the overall noise level with which amplifier 37 must operate. This compensation may not be required in embodiments for reduced accuracy applications.This invention will work with only one of the photodetectors 32 or 35. If both are used, one can, by varying k1 relative to k2, achieve compensation for certain types f instability in the opto nechanical system.In practice. in order to achieve a satisfactory sianal to noise ratio in the system, it is desirable to have the modulation index km, approximately 2 in value or in general, approximately p 2, where p is an odd integer. To achieve even the first of these values requires many more turns i . for the modulation windinq than the number of turns Hio , for the output windign. This makes an alternative magnetic structure attractive, which is shown in Figure 2. In this variant, a coil 60 the io turn winding is wound toroidally about the optical fiber 61, but the modulation maanetic field, being of an alternating nature, is produced by transforme action. A second coil 62 Ni turn modulation winding is wound on a suitable ferrite or tape wound toroidal magnetic core 63. This core 3 is then encircled along with the fiber coil 61 by an extremely low resistance one turn conductor formed by the copper or other low resistance case 65.The case 65 which must consist of at least two parts can employ gotd plating or gold gaskets at the interface between parts to secure low contact resistance when the parts are botted or otherwise fastened together. Ihe gold may be replaced by other soft noble metals of high electrical conductivity,.It can be seen that by proper orientation of the quarter wave plates 19 and 20 orFigure l, the mode of propagation within the fiber may be changed from right hand circular polarization to left hand circular polarization for both clockwise and counterclockwise beams without deterioration of the performance of this invention.it can also be seen that the exact sequential order of polarizers, lenses, and beao splitters is not essential to this invention. The essential quality of of the systen is that the beam propaged in the fiber be circular polarized of the sare. hand and that. when split and when reconbined,,both beams shall be in the sare state of polarization.Although the invention has been described and iTlustrated with a certain degree of particularity, it is understood that the present disclosure is made by way of example only and that numerous changes in the combination and arrangerent of parts may be resorted to by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as hereinafter claimed.
