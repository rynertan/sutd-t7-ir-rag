## Description
ELECTRICAL CONTROL CIRCUIT FOR A HOT WATER FURNACE This invention relates to an electrical control circuit for a hot water furnace. Electrical hot water furnaces have been known for a long time for heating private houses or apartments However, they require the immediate attendance of an electrician when heating element burns out otherwise, the efficiency of the furnace is greatly reduced. This can be very costly when failure occurs at night or during week ends, because of the overtime charges It is the object of the presentqinvention to provide a control circuit for an electrical hot water furnace, which permits connection of a spare heating element when a main heating element is burnt out, such spare heating element being preferably the heating element normally used to maintain the water in the furnace at a temperature between a low and high temperature limit when the furnace is not circulating hot water to the radiators of the house or apartment The electrical control circuit, in accordance with the invention, comprises at least one main heating element adapted for connecting to a power source for heating water circulated through the furnace, an additional heating element also adapted for connection to the power source, and switch means for disconnecting the main heating element when burnt out and for connecting such additional heating element. The electrical control circuit preferably comprises a first relay adapted for connection to the power source and having normally open contacts in series with the main heating element and normally closed contacts in series with the additional heating element. The above mentioned switch means is preferably a manual switch connected in series with such first relay for de energizing the first relay and thus disconnect the burnt heating element and connect the additional heating element The electrical control circuit pre.ferably comprises a secondary relay adapted for connection to the power source and having contacts in series with the additional heating element for energizing, the additional heating element to maintain the temperature of the, water in the furnace at a predetermined temperature.The above nientioned. first and second relays. are connected in series with high and low limit switches for controlling the temperature of the.water in the furnace The electrical control circuit also preferably comprises a transformer having its primary winding. connected across the power source, a motorized valve connected across the secondary winding of the transformer in series .with a thermostat controlling the temperature of a. house or apartment, and third and fourth relays, also connected across the,secondary winding of the. transformer in series with a switch operated by said motorized valve.The third relay has normally closed contacts connected in series with the first and second relays for controlling de energization of such relays The fourth relay has normally open contacts connected in series with a pump controlling the circulation of water through the furnace. Manual reset switches are also preferably connected in, series with the heating elements for disconnecting such elements in case of temperature overload The invention will now be disclosed, by way of exemple, with reference. to a preferred embodiment illustrated in the accompanying drawings, in,which Figure 1 illustratesa perspective view of a hot water furnace using the electrical control circuit in accordance with the invention Figure 2 illustrates a partly sectional view of the furnace of Figure 1 showing. the heating elements in the furnace and Figure 3 illustrates further control circuit for the hot water furnace. Referring. to Figures 1 and 2 of .the drawings, there is shown an electrical hot water furnace comprising an inner tank 10 and an outer envelope 12 separated by insulating material 14.. Water is fed to the furnace by means of inlet pipe 16 through pressure reducing valve 18 and air vent 20 A pump 22 is provided for circulating theater out of the furnace through outlet pipe 24 and motorized valve 26 and bask into the furnace through return pipe 28, The furnace is further provided with a drain valve 30, a pressure gauge 32 and a pressure relief valve 34.The electrical control circuit is housed in control box 36 secured to the furnace and provided with a main lines38, secondary line 40 leading to motorized valve 26, secondary lines 42 and 44.leading to the high and low temperature limit.regulators 46 and 4S, respectively, and secondary lines 50 leading to pump 22.Heating elements 52, 54 and 56 are mounted on the furnace wall and have terminals extending within the control box 36 Referring to Figure 3, there is the electrical control circuit which is fed with. 230 volts from lines L1 and L2 through main switches M1 and M2 and with 110 volts from lines L1 and N through switch M3. The primary winding of transformer T is, connected across lines L1 and N. The secondary winding of transformer T is connected to motorized valve V valve 26 Fig 1 through a thermostat Th controlling the temperature of the house or apartment.Relays R1 andR2 are also connected across the secondary of the transformer T in series with contacts V l of motorized valve V.Relays R3, R4 and R5 are also connected across lines L1 and N through high and low limit switches HL and LL. Switch HL opens when the temperature of the water in the furnace is above a predetermined value, while switch LL closes when. the temperature of theswater in.the furnace is below a predetermined value. Relays R4 and R5 arq connected in series with normally closed manual switches S1 andS2, respectively, and normally open contacts Rl lof relay R1. Pump P is connected in, series with contacts R2 1 of relay R2 across lines L and N. Heating elements A, Bb and C 52, 54 and 56 Fig L are connected across lines L1 and L2. Heating element A is connected in series with normally open relay contacts R3 ,l and R3 2 of relay R3 and a first parallel arrangement ofnormally closed contacts R4 2 and R5 2. Heating element B is connected in series with normally open contacts R4 3 and R4 4 ofKrelay R4. Heating element C is connected in series with normally open contacts R5 3 and R5 4 of relay R5.Manually reset thermal switches TS1, To2 and TS3 are cdnnected in series with heating elements A, B and C respectively The above disclosed.control circuit operates as follows When the thermostat switch Th closes, calling for heat, motorized valve V is energized, closing contacts V l and operating relays R1 and R2. The operation ,of relay R1 energizes relays R4 and R5 through closed contacts RA 1 and normally closed switch S1 and S2 provided that temperature limit switches HL and LL are closed.The operation of relay R2 energizes pump P through now closed contacts R l to start circulation of water through the pipes in the radiators of the house or apartment. As soon as pump P is.energized, cooler water is circulated through the furnace and this will automatically close low, limit switch LL to energize relays R4 and R5, as mentioned previously. The operation of relays R4 and R5 closes contacts R4 3, R4 4 R5 3 and R5 4.to energize main heating elements B and C. Thus, while the pump P is operated, heating elements Band Ctare energized to circulate hot water through the radiators of,the house or apartment. Relay R3 is energized when the temperature of the water in the furnace is lower than a low limit by closure of limit switch LL and de energized by opening af limit switch HI when. the temperature of the waster exceeds a predetermined limit. The operation of relayR3 closes contacts R3 1 and R3 2 to energize heating element A provided that contacts R4 1 and R4 2, or R5 1 and R5 2 are closed. As mentioned previously, this does not happen unless relays R4 and R5 are de energized by opening of contact Rl l when heat is not called for. Thus, heating element A is never operated when the heating ele ments B and C are operated. If one of the main heating elements B or C burns out, the building owner or attendant can easily localize the burnt heating element and open the switch S1 or 52 controlling the Qperation of relays R4 or R5. Depending on which one of switches S1 or S2 is opened, the de, energization of relays R4 and R5 will close their associated contacts R4 1 and R4 2 or R5 1 and R52 to energize heating element A. It will be understood that the burning of one of the regular heating elements will automatically loWer the tempera ture. of the water of the furnace and, thus, close the contacts R3 1 and R3 2 in series with heating element A. Thus, heating element A will be energized toereplace the burnt out element until an electrician is called in. No rush call will be needed, thus eliminating costly overtime charges. Although th,e invention has been disclosed with reference to a preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that alternative embodiments are envisaged and that the invention is to be limited by the scope of the claims only.
