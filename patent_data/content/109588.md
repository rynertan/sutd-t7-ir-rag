# A PROFILE EMBOSSED GRID ELECTRODE FOR STORAGE BATTERIES AND PROCESS FOR ITS MANUFACTURING

## Abstract
A profile embossed grid electrode for storage batteries provided with parallel linear grooves on both surface and comprising a perforated metal conductor grid and a match ing latticed plastic structure comprising parallel meshes. The metal plastic grid is filled with the active material and it is covered on both sides with a woven or non woven fabric. The electrode is then embossed on both sides with a tool profiled with ribs at the locations coincident with the vertically meshes. After embossing the vertical meshes retain the embossed grooves permanently on the electrode surface, giving vertical channels for the acid convenction and produce a self constrained tubular shaped electrode.
