# WAVE ENERGY CONVERTERS

## Abstract
A wave energy converter includes a beam, which can conveniently be a plurality of hinged pontoons 10, and fluid pumping means 14, 15, 16, 17, operable by flexing of the beam i.e. relative angular motion of adjacent pontoons 10 . The converter has means such as, for example, tensioned cables 12 extending substantially the length of the beam, which assist flexing of the beam. There is also means, which can conveniently be back pressure in the pumping means 19, 20, 23, 26, 14, 15 for variably applying a straightening force tending to straighten the beam. By suitable adjustment of the pumping means, flexing means, and straightening means the converter can be made resonant for a wide range of wave con ditions, so maximising the efficiency.
