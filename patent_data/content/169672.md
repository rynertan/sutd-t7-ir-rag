## Description
This invention relates to transgenic animals. Transgenic animals carry a gene which has been introduced into the germline of the animal, or an ancestor of the animal, at an early usually one cell developmental stage. Wagner et al. 1981 P.N.A.S. U.S.A. The present invention now provides a method for producing a transgenic non human mammalian animal having an increased probability of developing neoplasms, said method comprising chromosomally incorporating an activated oncogene sequence into the genome of a non human mammalian animal. In another aspect, the invention now provides a transgenic non human mammalian animal whose germ cells and somatic cells contain an activated oncogene sequence as a result of chromosomal incorporation into the animal genome, or into the genome of an ancestor of said animal. In general, the invention features the products of transgenic eukaryotic animals and non human eukaryotic animal preferably a rodent such as a mouse whose germ cells and somatic cells contain an activated oncogene sequence introduced into the animal, or an ancestor of the animal, at an embryonic stage preferably the one cell, or fertilized oocyte, stage, and generally not later than about the 8 cell stage . An activated oncogene sequence, as the term is used herein, means an oncogene which, when incorporated into the genome of the animal, increases the probability of the development of neoplasms particularly malignant tumors in the animal. There are several means by which an oncogene can be introduced into an animal embryo so as to be chromosomally incorporated in an activated state. One method is to transfect the embryo with the gene as it occurs naturally, and select transgenic animals in which the gene has integrated into the chromosome at a locus which results in activation. Other activation methods involve modifying the oncogene or its control sequences prior to introduction into the embryo. One such method is to transfect the embryo using a vector containing an already translocated oncogene. Other methods are to use an oncogene whose transcription is under the control of a synthetic or viral activating promoter, or to use an oncogene activated by one or more base pair substitutions, deletions, or additions. In a preferred embodiment, the chromosome of the transgenic animal includes an endogenous coding sequence most preferably the c Introduction of the oncogene sequence at the fertilized oocyte stage ensures that the oncogene sequence will be present in all of the germ cells and somatic cells of the transgenic animal. The presence of the onocogene sequence in the germ cells of the transgenic founder animal in turn means that all of the founder animal s descendants will carry the activated oncogene sequence in all of their germ cells and somatic cells. Introduction of the oncogene sequence at a later embryonic stage might result in the oncogene s absence from some somatic cells of the founder animal, but the descendants of such an animal that inherit the gene will carry the activated oncogene in all of their germ cells and somatic cells. Any oncogene or effective sequence thereof can be used to produce the transgenic mice of the invention. Table 1, below, lists some known viral and cellular oncogenes, many of which are homologous to DNA sequences endogenous to mice and or humans, as indicated. The term oncogene encompasses both the viral sequences and the homologous endogenous sequences The animals of the invention can be used to test a material suspected of being a carcinogen, by exposing the animal to the material and determining neoplastic growth as an indicator of carcinogenicity. This test can be extremely sensitive because of the propensity of the transgenic animals to develop tumors. This sensitivity will permit suspect materials to be tested in much smaller amounts than the amounts used in current animal carcinogenicity studies, and thus will minimize one source of criticism of current methods, that their validity is questionable because the amounts of the tested material used is greatly in excess of amounts to which humans are likley to be exposed. Furthermore, the animals will be expected to develop tumors much sooner because they already contain an activated oncogene. The animals are also preferable, as a test system, to bacteria used, e.g., in the Ames test because they, like humans, are vertebrates, and because carcinogenicity, rather than mutagenicity, is measured. The animals of the invention can also be used as tester animals for materials, e.g. antioxidants such as beta carotine or Vitamin E, thought to confer protection against the development of neoplasms. An animal is treated with the material, and a reduced incidence of neoplasm development, compared to untreated animals, is detected as an indication of protection. The method can further include exposing treated and untreated animals to a carcinogen prior to, after, or simultaneously with treatment with the protective material. The animals of the invention can also be used as a source of cells for cell culture. Cells from the animals may advantageously exhibit desirable properties of both normal and transformed cultured cells i.e., they will be normal or nearly normal morphologically and physiologically, but can, like cells such as NIH 3T3 cells, be cultured for long, and perhaps indefinite, periods of time. Further, where the promoter sequence controlling transcription of the oncogene sequence is inducible, cell growth rate and other culture characteristics can be controlled by adding or eliminating the inducing factor. Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the description of the preferred embodiments, and from the claims. The drawings will now briefly be described.

Figs. 3 6 and 8 are diagrammatic representations of activated oncogene fusions. Fig. 8 illustrates schematically plasmid RSV S107. Fig. 7 is a diagrammatic representation of a probe useful for detecting activated Gene fusions were made using the mouse The required MMTV functions were provided by the pA9 plasmid Fig. 2 that demonstrated hormone inducibility of the p21 protein this plasmid is described in Huang et al. 1981 Cell The above plasmids were used to construct the four fusion gene contructions illustrated in Figs. 3 6. The constructions were made by deleting from pA9 the Sma EcoRI region that included the P21 protein coding sequences, and replacing it with the four MMTV H3 The MMTV Xba The constructions of Figs. 4 and 6 contain the two promoters naturally preceding the unactivated These constructions were all checked by multiple restriction enzyme digestions and were free of detectable rearrangements. The above MMTV At four weeks of age, each pup born was analyzed using DNA taken from the tail in a Southern hybridization using a ³²P DNA probe labeled by nick translation . In each case, DNA from the tail was digested with BamHI and ClaI and probed with the ³²P labeled BamHI HindIII probe from the normal The DNA for analysis was extracted from 0.1 1.5 cm sections of tail, by the method described in Davis et al. 1980 in Methods in Enzymology, Grossman et al., Ten µl of the tail DNA preparation approximately 10 µg DNA were digested to completion, electrophoresed through 0.8 agarose gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose, as described in Southern 1975 J. Mol. Biol. The Southern hybridizations indicated that ten founder mice had retained an injected MMTV The founder animals were mated to uninjected animals and DNA of the resulting thirteen lines of transgenic offspring analyzed this analysis indicated that in every case the injected genes were transmitted through the germline. Eleven of the thirteen lines also expressed the newly acquired MMTV Transcription of the newly acquired genes in tissues was determined by extracting RNA from the tissues and assaying the RNA in an S1 nuclease protection procedure, as follows. The excised tissue was rinsed in 5.0 ml cold Hank s buffered saline and total RNA was isolated by the method of Chrigwin et al. 1979 Biochemistry Labelled, single stranded probe fragments were isolated on 8 M urea 5 acrylamide gels, electroeluted, and hybridized to total RNA in a modification of the procedure of Berk et al. 1977 Cell Northern hybridization analysis was also carried out, as follows. Total RNA was electrophoresed through 1 formaldehyde 0.8 agarose gels, blotted to nitrocellulose filters Lehrach et al. 1979 Biochemistry Both lines of mice which had integrated and were transmitting to the next generation the MMTV Stu One of two lines of mice found to carry the MMTV Sma Four lines of mice carried the MMTV H3 In two mouses lines found to carry the MMTV Xba Referring to Fig. 8, the plasmid designated RSV S107 was generated by inserting the EcoRI fragment of the S107 plasmacytoma The illustrated Fig. 8 regions of plasmid RSV S107 are crosshatched, RSV sequences fine hatched, alpha 1 coding sequences left hatched, immunoglobulin alpha switch sequences right hatched, Approximately 500 copies of the RSV S107 First generation transgenic offspring of each of these founder males were analyzed for expression of the rearranged Backcrossing to C57Bl 6J and in breeding matings produced some transgenic mice which did not demonstrate the same restriction site patterns on Southern blot analysis as either their transgenic siblings or their parents. In the first generation progeny derived from a mating between the founder male and C57BL 6J females, 34 F1 animals were analyzed and of these, 19 inherited the newly introduced gene, a result consistent with the founder being a heterozygote at one locus. However, of the 19 transgenic mice analyzed, there were three qualitatively different patterns with respect to the more minor In order to test the possibility that these heterogenous genotypes arose as a consequence of multiple insertions and or germline mosacism in the founder, two F1 mice one carrying the 7.8 and 12 Kb BamHI bands, and the other carrying only the 7.8 Kb BamHI band were mated and the F2 animals analyzed. One male born to the mating of these two appeared to have sufficient copies of the RSV S107 To determine whether, in addition to the polymorphisms arising at the DNA level, the level of aberrant The animals of the invention can be used to test a material suspected of being a carcinogen, as follows. If the animals are to be used to test materials thought to be only weakly carcinogenic, the transgenic mice most susceptible of developing tumors are selected, by exposing the mice to a low dosage of a known carcinogen and selecting those which first develop tumors. The selected animals and their descendants are used as test animals by exposing them to the material suspected of being a carcinogen and determining neoplastic growth as an indicator of carcinogenicity. Less sensitive animals are used to test more strongly carcinogenic materials. Animals of the desired sensitivity can be selected by varying the type and concentration of known carcinogen used in the selection process. When extreme sensitivity is desired, the selected test mice can consist of those which spontaneously develop tumors. The animals of the invention can be used to test materials for the ability to confer protection against the development of neoplasms. An animal is treated with the material, in parallel with an untreated control transgenic animal. A comparatively lower incidence of neoplasm development in the treated animal is detected as an indication of protection. The transgenic animals of the invention can be used as a source of cells for cell culture. Tissues of transgenic mice are analyzed for the presence of the activated oncogene, either by directly analyzing DNA or RNA, or by assaying the tissue for the protein expressed by the gene. Cells of tissues carrying the gene can be cultured, using standard tissue culture techniques, and used. e.g., to study the functioning of cells from normally difficult to culture tissues such as heart tissue. Plasmids bearing the fusion genes shown in Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 have been deposited in the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD, and given, respectively, ATCC Accession Nos. 39745 39746 , 39747 , 39748 , and 39749 . Other embodiments are within the following claims. For example, any species of transgenic animal can be employed. In some circumstances, for instance, it may be desirable to use a species, e.g., a primate such as the rhesus monkey, which is evolutionarily closer to humans than mice.
