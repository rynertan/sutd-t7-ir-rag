# Guides for forming connections, and methods for forming connections.

## Abstract
A guide for use in connecting a riser pipe to a subsea riser base comprises a guide post 1 and an expanding mandrel 2 actuable by hydraulic pressure applied through a cable 6 having hydraulic hoses in its core to lock the mandrel in a subsea riser base. The guide post is provided with buoyancy means to reduce its effective weight in water to enable it to be manipulated and manoeuvred by a remote controlled vehicle or diver.
