# Modular ground mine.

## Abstract
A naval ground mine comprising two modules 1, 2 each having a cylindrical casing 4 containing explosive material. The modules have mating end faces 5 , each provided with a spigot 6 . Lips 7 on adjacent spigots form an annular projection which tapers in a radially outward direction. The two modules 1, 2 are held together by a split ring 3 having a corresponding internally tapered surface 9 , which embraces this annular projection. As the ring 3 is tightened, the adjacent end faces 4, 5 are drawn tightly together. The external surface of the ring provides a smooth transition between the external surfaces of the modules, so as to minimise surface discontinuity and the possibility of detection by sonar.
