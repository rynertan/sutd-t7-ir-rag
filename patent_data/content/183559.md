# HEATING APPARATUS

## Abstract
This invention relates to a heating appliance which incorporates a viewport 10 through which combustion can be viewed. The viewport 10 incorporates a portion 13b which is reflectorised so as to reflect some of the radiant heat of the burning fuel in the fire chamber back into the fire chamber to maintain high temperatures in the fire chamber for efficient combustion whilst reducing the temperature of the outer surface 13a of the viewport and accordingly the likelihood of injury to persons accidentally touching the viewport and the possible damaging effects of thermal exposure and shock. The viewport is reflectorised in the preferred embodi ment by a treatment which enhances the reflectivity of the transparent or translucent portion over that of transparent glass.
