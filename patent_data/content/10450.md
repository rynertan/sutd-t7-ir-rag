# Sensitized electrophoretic migration imaging dispersion and process.

## Abstract
Compounds selected from the group consisting of a triaryl amines having a p alkyl, p alkoxy or p alkoxycarbonylalkyl substituent on the aryl groups, b aryl alkanes, isoalkanes and cycloalkanes, having at least two aryl groups with at least one aryl group having a tertiary amino substituent, c aryldialkylamines having a pyranylalkenyl, a quinolinylalkenyl or an arylazo subsituent on the aryl group, d a julolidine and e an isobenzofuran are useful as sensitizers in a sensitized electrophoretic migration imaging dispersion and process The drawing illustrates an apparatus suited to carry out this process.
