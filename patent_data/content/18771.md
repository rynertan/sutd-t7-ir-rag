# Ultrasonic imaging device.

## Abstract
An ultrasonic image of improved resolution is obtained by utilizing separate transducers 4, 10 for transmission and reception of ultrasonic pulses utilized for imaging, one transducer 4 being a cylindrical or simulated cylindrical transducer having a line focus and the other transducer 10 being aimed along the focus of the first transducer. An area to be imaged may be scanned by rotating and or traversing the transducers 4, 10 as a unit.
