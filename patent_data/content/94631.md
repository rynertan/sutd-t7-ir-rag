## Abstract
Apparatus for threading a web 25 through a printing press 20 includes a single cable 33 extending through the press 20 along the web path on one side of the web 25 . The leading edge 58 of the web 25 is connected to the cable 33 by a leader 56 , so that the web 25 is pulled through the printing press 20 when the cable 33 is driven. The cable 25 is supported by sheaves 45 that are mounted coaxially with the lead rollers 44 that guide the web 25 through the press 20 .
