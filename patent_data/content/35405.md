# AUTOMATED CLEANING SYSTEM FOR DIALYZERS AND A METHOD OF CLEANING DIALYZERS

## Abstract
The invention relates to an apparatus and method of cleaning artificial dialyzers having a blood side and a dialy sate side. The system provides a fully automated cleaning system usable with parallel plate coil and hollow fibre type dialyzers and comprises an element for storing a predeter mined sequence of cleaning procedures, said element pro vides control signals a regulator for determining the flow of a plurality of blood cleaning reagents through the dialysate and blood sides of the dialyzer a controller responsive to said control signals for automatically actuating said reg ulator to provide said cleaning procedures in said predeter mined sequence a monitor for sensing the condition of said dialyzer during cleaning and a member responsive to said monitor for varying said predetermined sequence.
