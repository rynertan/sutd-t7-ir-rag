## Abstract
For controlling selection of needles, intermediate jacks or pattern jacks in a circular knitting machine there is provided a stepwise advanced pattern drum 5 selectively acting on selection slides 3 which interfere with butts of needles, intermediate jacks or pattern jacks. The drum 5 is advanced by a paw 10 pivoted to a rocking lever 11 controlled by a cam 12 the axis whereof is different from the axis of the needle cylinder 1 . The cam 12 is rotated at a speed timed to that of the needle cylinder 1 . The cam 12 has two different profiles 12a, 12b at different heights for acting on said lever 11 and may be provided with additional superposed profiles 21 for action on the selection slides 3 through respective three arm levers 8 .
