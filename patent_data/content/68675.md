# Method of making an electron resist pattern.

## Abstract
The method comprises the steps of applying a coating of a negative electron resist film material comprising a mixture of an aliphatic vinyl base polymer having a relatively high plasma etch rate and a monomer having a relatively low plasma etch rate to a substrate applying a coating of a barrier polymer film over said negative electron resist film to prevent vacuum sublimation of said monomer exposing said negative electron resist film to an electron beam describing a predetermined pattern removing said coating of barrier polymer baking said resist film prior to development thereof and developing said exposed resist pattern by plasma etching.
