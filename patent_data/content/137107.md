# A computer generated imagery system.

## Abstract
In a computer generated imagery system having a data base containing descriptions of polygonal faces defining an object or scene to be depicted by an image it is usually necessary to provide means for ensuring that, for a particular point of observation relative to the object or scene, faces which are hidden by other faces are not displayed. To deal with this problem it has previously been proposed for each face to be allocated, in the data base, a code defining the direction in which it is directed. Faces directed away from the observer are not displayed. This technique is satisfactory for a simple object such as a cube or sphere but does not work for more complex shapes where one face, directed towards the observer may obscure another also directed towards the observer. To deal with such situations it is necessary to allocate to each face, a priority value, these priority values defining a hierarchy which determines which faces pointing generally towards rather than away from the observer are cabable of obscuring other faces also pointing towards the observer. Thus a face of priority 1 could be defined as being able to obscure any face of lower priority, e.g. of priority 2, etc., etc. The simple allocation of priorities works in most situa tions but for some shapes it is found impossible to allocate priorities as mentioned above. In accordance with the invention each face is given more than one and preferably four priorities, one for each of at least two and preferably four different angles of view, and the face having the height priority is selected at 29R for display in preference to any face or part thereof of lower priority behind it.
