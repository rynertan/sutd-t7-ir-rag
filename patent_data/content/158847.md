## Description
Antiviral Compound The present invention relates to antiviral purine derivatives containing an acyclic chain in the 9 position.U.K. Patent Specification No. 1523865 describes a broad class of purine derivatives containing an acyclic side chain in the 9 position. These purine derivatives have been found to have antiviral activity against various classes ofDNA viruses particularly against herpes viruses such as herpes simplex.Among these derivatives, 9 2 hydroxyethoxymethyl guanine otherwise known as acyclovir has been found to have particularly good activity against herpes viruses such as herpes simplex. However, while acyclovir has been found to be especially effective upon topical or parenteral administration, it is only moderately well absorbed upon oral administration with corresponding levels of drug in the plasma. It will be appreciated that when one is treating an internal disorder by oral administration of a drug, it is clearly desirable that the drug should be well absorbed from the gastro intestinal tract with resulting high plasma levels.We have now made the surprising discovery that purine derivatives which are characterised by the presence of a hydrogen atom in the 6 position of the purine nucleus, can be readily converted in vivo by the action of enzymes of the molybdo flavo protein type especially xanthine oxidase dehydrogenase or aldehyde oxidase into the corresponding 6 hydroxy purine derivatives having antiviral activity. Furthermore, from experiments in rats, we have found that oral administration of such 6 hydrogen derivatives results in efficient absorption from the gastro intestinal tract and high plasma levels of the corresponding 6hydroxy compound, formed by enzymatic conversion of the 6 hydrogen compound.The above mentioned class of 6 hydrogen purine derivatives may be represented by the general formulaEMI1.1 wherein X is sulphur or oxygen or a chemical bond R1 is halogen, amino or azido R2 is hydrogen, hydroxy, alkyl or hydroxyalkyl R3 is hydrogen or alkyl R4 is hydroxy, hydroxyalkyl, benzyloxy, phosphate or carboxypropionyloxy R5 is hydrogen, alkyl or hydroxyalkyl and esters of those compounds wherein R2 is hydroxy or hydroxyalkyl, R4 is hydroxy, hydroxyalkyl or carboxypropionyloxy orR5 is hydroxyalkyl and physiologically acceptable salts of such compounds of formula I and their esters, other than the compound of formula I wherein X is oxygen, R1 is amino, R2, R3 and R5 are each hydrogen and R4 is hydroxy, its benzoate ester and its physiologically acceptable salts.In the above formula, the alkyl groups, which may be straight chain or branched, generally contain 1 to 8, preferably 1 to 4, carbon atoms, e.g. methyl. A preferred class of compounds of formula I are those of formulaEMI2.1 wherein X represents an oxygen or sulphur atom and Y represents a hydrogen atom or a hydroxymethyl group and physiologically acceptable esters and salts thereof, other than the compound of formula IA wherein X represents an oxygen atom and Y represents a hydrogen atorn, its benzoate ester and its physiologically acceptable salts.Salts of the compounds of formula I which may be conveniently used in therapy include physiologically acceptable salts of organic acids such as lactic, acetic, malic or p toluenesulphonic acid as well as physiologically acceptable salts of mineral acids such as hydrochloric or sulphuric acid.Esters of the compounds of formula I which may be conveniently used in therapy include those containing a formyloxy or C1 16 for example 6 alkanoyloxy e.g. acetoxy or propionyloxy , optionally substituted aralkanoyloxy e.g. phenyl C1 4alkanoyloxy such as phenyl acetoxy or optionally substituted aroyloxy e.g. benzoyloxy or naphthoyloxy ester grouping at one or both of the terminal positions of the 9 side chain of the compounds of formula I . The above mentioned aralkanoyloxy and aroyloxy ester groups may be substituted, for example by one or more halogen e.g. chlorine or bromine atoms or amino, nitrile or sulphamido groups, the aryl moiety of the grouping advantageously containing 6 to 10 carbon atoms.The present invention also includes bioprecursors of the compounds of formula I and their physiologically acceptable salts and esters, i.e. compounds which are converted in vivo into compounds of formula I and their above mentioned derivatives.2 Amino 9 2 benzoyloxyethoxymethyl purine i.e. the benzoate ester of the compound of formula IA wherein X represents an oxygen atom and Y represents a hydrogen atom is disclosed in U.S. Patent Specification No. 4,199,547 and no claim is made herein to this compound per se. However, there is no indication or suggestion in the said U.S. Specification that the compound can be converted in vivo into the corresponding 6 hydroxy analogue.The discovery that the 6 hydrogen purines above can be readily converted into their corresponding 6 hydroxy analogues is surprising since in previous studies with xanthine oxidase from bovine milk H.Lettre et al 1967 Biochem.Pharmacol., 16, 1747 1755 T.A. Krenitsky et al 1972 Arch. Biophys., 150, 585 599 , it was shown that 9 substitution obliterates or greatly diminishes the rate at which a variety of purines are oxidised. In view of these observations, it was surprising to find that this enzyme oxidised for example 6deoxyacyclovir, a 9 substituted derivative of 2 aminopurine, at a faster rate than the 9 unsubstituted purine, as we have established from enzyme studies.The high level of absorption of the compounds of formula I from the gastrointestinal tract renders the compounds especially useful when oral administration of the compounds is desired, e.g. in the treatment of diseases caused by variousDNA viruses, such as herpes infections for example herpes simplex, varicella or zoster, cytomegaiovirus as well as diseases caused by hepatitis B or Epstein 8arr virus. The compounds of formula I can also be used for the treatment or prophylaxis of papillbma or wart virus infections. In addition to their use in human medical therapy the compounds of formula I can be administered to other animals for the treatment or prophylaxis of viral diseases, e.g. in other mammals. For example, those compounds of formula I wherein Y represents a hydroxymethyl are especially useful for the treatment of equine rhinopneumonitis.By administration of a compound of formula I or physiologically acceptable salt or ester thereof, especially by the oral route, it is possible to achieve an advantageous effect against such disorders.The compounds of formula I and the physiologically acceptable salts and esters thereof hereafter collectively referred to as the active ingredients may be administered by any route appropriate to the condition to be treated, suitable routes including oral, rectal, nasal, topical including buccal and sublingual , vaginal and parenteral including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal, intrathecal and epidural . It will be appreciated that the preferred route may vary with for example the condition of the recipient.For each of the above indicated utilities and indications the amount required of an active ingredient as above defined will depend upon a number of factors including the severity of the condition to be treated and the identity of the recipient and will ultimately be at the discretion of the attendant physician or veterinarian.In general however, for each of these utilities and indications, a suitable, effectivefese wi be ifftherange 0.1 to 250mg per kilogram bodyweight of recipient per day, preferably in the range 1 to 100mg per kilogram bodyweight per day and most preferably in the range 5 to 20mg per kilogram bodyweight per day an optimum dose is about 10mg per kilogram bodyweight per day. Unless otherwise indicated all weights of active ingredient are calculated as the parent compound of formula I for salts and esters thereof the figures would be increased proportionately. The desired dose is preferably presented as two, three, four or more sub doses administered at appropriate intervals throughout the day. These sub doses may be administered in unit dosage forms, for example, containing 10 to 1000mg, preferably 20 to 500mg and most preferably 100 to 400mg of active ingredient per unit dosage form.While it is possible for the active ingredients to be administered alone it is preferable to present them as pharmaceutical formulations. The formulations, both for veterinary and for human use, of the present invention comprise at least one active ingredient, as above defined, together with one or more acceptable carriers therefor and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. The carrier s must be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. The formulations include those suitable for oral, rectal, nasal, topical including buccal and sublingual , vaginal or parenteral including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal, intrathecal and epidural administration. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients.In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.Formulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient as a powder or granules as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non aqueous liquid or as an oilin water liquid emulsion or a water in oil liquid emulsion. The active ingredient may also be presented as a bolus, electuary or paste.A tablet may be made by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, surface active or dispersing agent. Moulded tablets may be made by moulding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein.For infections of the eye or other external tissues e.g. mouth and skin, the formulations are preferably applied as a topical ointment or cream containing the active ingredient in an amount of, for example, 0.075 to 20 w w, preferably 0.2 to 15 w w and most preferably 0.5 to 10 w w. When formulated in an ointment, the active ingredients may be employed with either a paraffinic or a water miscible ointment base. Alternatively, the active ingredients may be formulated in a cream with an oil in water cream base.If desired, the aqueous phase of the cream base may include, for example, at least 30 w w of a polyhydric alcohol, i.e. an alcohol having two or more hydroxyl groups such as propylene glycol, butane 1,3 diol, mannitol, sorbitol, glycerol and polyethylene glycol and mixtures thereof. The topical formulations may desirably include a compound which enhances absorption or penetration of the active ingredient through the skin or other affected areas. Examples of such dermal penetration enhancers include dimethylsulphoxide and related analogues.The oily phase of the emulsions of this invention may be constituted from known ingredients in a known manner. While the phase may comprise merely an emulsifier otherwise known as an emulgent , it desirably comprises a mixture of at least one emulsifier with a fat or an oil or with both a fat and an oil.Preferably, a hydrophilic emulsifier is included together with a lipophilic emulsifier which acts as a stabiliser. It is also preferred to include both an oil and a fat Together, the emulsifier s with or without stabiliser s make up the so called emuisifying wax, and the wax together with the oil and fat make up the so called emulsifying ointment base which forms the oily dispersed phase of the cream formulations.Emulgents and emulsion stabilisers suitable for use in the formulation of the present invention include Tween 60, Span 80, cetostearyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, glyceryl mono stearate and sodium lauryl sulphate.The choice of suitable oils or fats for the formulation is based on achieving the desired cosmetic properties, since the solubility of the active compound in most oils likely to be used in pharmaceutical emulsion formulations is very low. Thus the cream should preferably be a non greasy, non staining and washable product with suitable consistency to avoid leakage from tubes or other containers.Straight or branched chain, mono or dibasic alkyl esters such as di isoadipate, isocetyl stearate, propylene glycol diester of coconut fatty acids, isopropyl myristate, decyl oleate, isopropyl palmitate, butyl stearate, 2 ethylhexyl palmitate or a blend of branched chain esters known as Crodamol CAP may be used, the last three being preferred esters. These may be used alone or in combination depending on the properties required. Alternatively, high melting point lipids such as white soft paraffin and or liquid paraffin or other mineral oils can be used.Formulations suitable for topical administration to the eye also include eye drops wherein the active ingredient is dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier, especially an aqueous solvent for the active ingredient. The active ingredient is preferably present in such formulations in a concentration of 0.5 to 20 , advantageously 0.5 to 10 particularly about 1.5 w w.Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavoured basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert basis such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier.Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with a suitable base comprising for example cocoa butter or a salicylate.Formulations suitable for nasal administration wherein the carrier is a solid include a coarse powder having a particle size for example in the range 20 to 500 microns which is administered in the manner in which snuff is taken, i.e. by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage from a container of the powder held close up to the nose. Suitable formulations wherein the carrier is a liquid, for administration as for example a nasal spray or as nasal drops, include aqueous or oily solutions of the active ingredient.Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing in addition to the active ingredient such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and nonaqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient and aqueous and non aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The formulations may be presented in unit dose or multi dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze dried lyophilized condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described. Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or unit daily sub dose, as herein above recited, or an appropriate fraction therof, of an active ingredient. It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above the formulations of this invention may include other agents conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question, for example those suitable for oral administration may include flavouring agents.The present invention further provides veterinary compositions comprising at least one active ingredient as above defined together with a veterinary carrier therefor.Veterinary carriers are materials useful for the purpose of administering the composition and may be solid, liquid or gaseous materials which are otherwise inert or acceptable in the veterinary art and are compatible with the active ingredient. These veterinary compositions may be administered orally, parenterally or by any other desired route.For oral administration the compositions can be in the form of a tablet, granule, drench, paste, cachet, capsule or feed supplement. Granules may be made by the well known techniques of wet granulation, precompression or slugging. They can be administered to animals in an inert liquid vehicle so as to form a drench, or in a suspension with water or oil base. Preferably further accessory ingredients such as a dispensing agent are included. These formulations preferably contain from 15 to 85 of the active ingredient.A paste may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a liquid diluent. A stiffening or thickening agent may be included together with a wetting agent or a humectant if the liquid diluent is water. If an emulsion paste is needed then one or more surface active agents should desirably be included.From 25 to 80 by weight of these paste formulations may comprise the active ingredient.In feed supplements the active ingredient is generally present in large amounts relative to the accessory ingredients, and the supplements may be added directly or after intermediate blending or dilution. Examples of accessory ingredients for such formulations include solid, orally ingestible carriers such as corn meal, soya flour, wheat shorts, soya grits, edible vegetable materials and fermentation residues. The active ingredient is usually incorporated in one or more of the accessory ingredients and intimately and uniformly dispersed by grinding, tumbling or stirring with conventional apparatus. Formulations containing 1 to 90 by weight of the active ingredient are suitable for adding to feeds.For the treatment of herpes infections in horses, an oral or parenteral dose of from 0.1 to 250mg per kg body weight per day, preferably from 2 to 100mg per kg per day may be required. The dose may be split up into discrete units administered at regular intervals during the day, and repeated daily for up to 14 days or until the infection is cleared. For viral infections in other animals the dose may vary depending on the size and metabolism of the animal. The compositions may be administered in unit dosage form, such as a tablet a few times daily in the amount of 10 to 1000mg per unit dose.The compounds of formula I and their physiologically acceptable salts and esters may be prepared in conventional manner by analogous processes for preparing compounds of similar structure, such as those methods described inU.K. Patent Specification No. 1523865. The present invention provides a process for the preparation of compounds of formula I and physiologically acceptable salts and esters thereof other than a compound of formula I wherein X is oxygen, R1 is amino, R2, R3 and R5 are each hydrogen and R4 is hydroxy, and the benzoate ester and physiologically acceptable salts thereof, which comprises a deblocking a compound ofEMI9.1 wherein X and R are as defined above and R R represents an amino or blocked amino group R2a and R4 amino group a and ra4, which may be the same or different, each represents a hydroxy or hydroxyalkyl group or a blocked hydroxy or hydroxyalkyl group, R5 represents a hydroxyalkyl or blocked hydroxyalkyl group, providing at least one of Ra, Ra, Ra and R5a represents a blocked group b converting a compound of formulaEMI10.1 wherein X, R2, R3, R4 and R5 are as defined above, M represents a hydrogen atom or a group or atom convertible into a hydrogen atom and G represents a group or atom convertible into an amino group or when M is other than a hydrogen atom G may alternatively represent an amino group or a salt or ester thereof into a compound of formula I wherein R1 represents an amino group or a physiologically acceptable salt or ester thereof c reacting a compound of formulaEMI10.2 wherein Q represents a leaving atom or group with a compound of formulaEMI10.3 wherein X, R2, 7 and R5 are as defined above and A represents a leaving group or atom and B represents an optionally protected hydroxy group d closing a ring in a precursor compound having either the pyrimidine or imidazole ring incompletely formed e reducing a compound of formulaEMI11.1 wherein X, R1, R3, R4 and R5 are as defined above or a salt or ester thereof to form a compound of formula I wherein R2 represents a hydroxymethyl group or a physiologically acceptable salt or ester thereof f converting a compound of formulaEMI11.2 wherein X, R1, R2, R3 and R5 are as defined above into a corresponding compound of formula I wherein R4 represents a hydroxy group and optionally effecting one or more of the following conversions, in any desired sequence i where the resulting product is a base,. converting the said base into a physiologically acceptable acid addition salt thereof ii where the resulting product is an acid additon salt, converting the said salt into the parent base iii where the resulting product is a compound of formula I or a salt thereof converting the said compound or salt thereof into a physiologically acceptable ester of the said compound or salt and or iv where the resulting product is an ester of a compound of formula I converting the said ester into the parent compound of formula I , a physiologically acceptable salt thereof or a different physiologically acceptable ester thereof.In method a the blocking groups may be selected, as appropriate, for example from acyl groups such as C1 4alkanoyl groups e.g. acetyl or pivaloyl, or aroyl groups, e.g. benzoyl arylmethyl groups e.g. benzyl or tri C1alkylsilyl e.g.trimethylsilyl. Arylmethyl blocking groups, may be removed for example by hydrogenolysis, e.g. by hydrogenation in the presence of Raney nickel or palladium catalyst or by the use of sodium in liquid ammonia. Acyl blocking groups may be removed for example by hydrolysis using for example an amine such as methylamine or triethylamine, advantageously in an aqueous medium. Trialkylsilyl blocking groups may be removed for example by solvolysis e.g. with alcoholic or aqueous ammonia, or by alcoholysis.Alternatively, when R2a represents a blocked hydroxymethyl group and R4a represents a blocked hydroxy group, the blocking may be effected by a common grouping, i.e. as in a compound of formula.EMI12.1 wherein, X, R1 and R5 are as defined above . Deblocking may be effected, for example, by hydrolysis e.g. under basic conditions, preferably by treatment with an organic amine such as methylamine or triethylamine.Conversion of a compound of formula III into a compound of formula I , by method b , can be achieved by various conventional means. For example G may represent an azide group which can be reduced to an amino group by catalytic hydrogenation using a suitable catalyst such as palladium. Alternatively, G may represent a halogen atom or an alkylthio or alkylsulphonyl group which can be converted to an amino group by aminolysis using for example ammonia. M may represent a halogen e.g. chlorine, atom or a mercapto or thio S c group which can be converted into a hydrogen atom in conventional manner.In the case where M represents a thio group, this conversion may be effected using a compound of formula III in which any amino or hydroxyl groups are optionally blocked by acyl groups, the conversion being effected using a Raney nickel catalyst, e.g in a basic medium which additionally removes the amino and or hydroxy blocking groups in accordance with process a .These processes together with other conventional processes are described inFused Pyrimidines, Part II, Purines Ed. by D. J. Brown 1971 , Wiley Interscience.In process c , the group Q in formula IV may for example represent a hydrogen atom an acyl group, e.g. a C1 4alkanoyl group such as an acetyl group or an aroyl group such as a benzoyl group or a tri C14alkylsflyl group such as a trimethylsilyl group. The group A in formula V may for example represent a halogen atom e.g. chlorine or an acyloxy group wherein the acyl moiety may be for example a C14alkanoyl group such as acetyl, or an aroyl group such as benzoyl. The reaction may be conveniently effected in a strong polar solvent such as dimethylformamide cr hexamethylphosphoramide, advantageously in the presence of a base such as triethylamine or potassium carbonate.Alternatively, a thermal condensation may be effected by heating the compounds of formulae IV and V in the presence of a catalytic amount of a strong acid, e.g.sulphuric acid.Process d involves the ring closure of either the imidazole or pyrimidine ring to give the final product. In the case of the imidazole ring this may be achieved by reaction of an appropriate percursor with a C1 reagent, such as triethylorthoformate, under for example mildly acidic conditions, at a temperature of about 25 0C, for several hours. A suitable precursor is substituted pyrimidine of formula IX EMI14.1 An alternative reagent is diethoxymethyl acetate, when neutral conditions at about 1000C for about 10 15 minutes are preferred.Reduction of a compound of formula VI in process e may be achieved for example by reaction with an appropriate aldehyde reducing agent such as sodium borohydride, sodium cyanoborohydride, tetraethylammonium borohydride or pyridine diborane tetrahydrofuran trifluoroace tic acid.In process f the conversion is advantageously effected by treatment of the amino compound of formula VII with a nitrite, e.g. sodium nitrite, in an acidic medium.The starting materials employed in the processes described above may be prepared in conventional manner, e.g. in accordance with the processes described in the above mentioned UK Patent Specification 1523865. The following Examples illustrate the present inventionExample 1A 1 litre round bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a Cacti2 drying tube was charged with 5.09 29.50mM 2 amino 6 chloro purine, 6.89 29.50mM 2 chloromethylthio ethyl benzoa te, 4.079 29.50mM potassium carbonate and 750ml of anhydrous dimethyl formamide. The reaction was stirred at room temperature for 16 hours after which time another 2.09 8.7mM of 2 chloromethylthio ethyl benzoate with 1.29 8.7mM potassium carbonate were added and stirring continued for an additional 24 hours at room temperature.The reaction mixture was then filtered through a pad of Celite in a sintered glass funnel and rotary evaporated in vacuo to a viscous yellow oil.The oil was adsorbed on to 20.09 of Merck silica gel 60 70 230 mesh and this preadsorbed phase applied to the top of a column of Merck silica gel 60 230 400 mesh .Elution of the column using 6 4 ethyl acetate benzene provided 2 amino 9 2 benzoyloxyethylthiomethyl 6 chloro 9H purine as an off white solid as a single material by TLC on silica gel 8 2 ethyl acetate hexane.

This was shaken in a Parr hydrogenator under 50 p.s.i.hydrogen for 16 hours at room temperature. TLC of the hydogenolysis product on silica gel with 8 methanol ethyl acetate showed only partial reaction. The catalyst was removed by filtration through a pad of Celite in a sintered glass funnel, 2.09 of fresh Pd OH 2 catalyst and 7.0ml triethylamine were added and the reaction mixture again shaken under 50 p.s.i. hydrogen for 20 hours. At this point t.l.c showed the reaction to be complete, the catalyst was removed as before and the methanol removed by rotary evaporation in vacuo to give a clear glass, which was taken up into 100ml of 1 1 methanol water containing 20 methylamine. The resulting solution was stirred at room temperature for 4 hours and removed by rotary evaporation in vacuo to give an amorphous solid.The solid was adsorbed on to 10.09 of 70 230 mesh Merck silica gel 60 and this preadsorbed phase applied to the top of a column of 230 400 mesh Merck silica gel 60.
