## Description
PROCESS FOR PREPARING 2 HYDROXY 2 PHENYLETHYLAMINES The present invention belongs to the field of pharmaceutical and synthetic organic chemistry, and provides a process for preparing 2 hydroxy 2 phenylethylamines by the direct reaction of a styrene oxide, which may be substituted on the phenyl ring, with the silylated derivative of the desired amine. The products of the process include a wide variety of hydroxysubstituted amines useful in many fields of pharmaceutical chemistry. The process is highly selective in its ability to break the epoxide moiety of the styrene oxide, and to provide for attack of the amine at the carbon, rather than at the a carbon. Compounds of the general type produced by the process of this invention have long been of interest to pharmaceutical chemists, and many processes for making them have been studied. European Patent Application No.79301282.4 describes the preparation of this type of compound by the direct coupling of styrene oxide, or a ring substituted styrene oxide, with the appropriate phenylalkylamine, at 50 80 . Various workers in the past have carried out processes which open epoxides to attack by active substituting agents. For example, Guindon et al.,Syn. Comm. 11, 391 98 1981 , used aryl or alkylthiotrialkylsilanes to substitute on styrene oxide. When they used zinc iodide as a catalyst in the reaction, they obtained primarily attack at the carbon a to the phenyl ring, but, when butyllithium was used as catalyst, they found primarily attack at the carbon. Andrews et al., Tet. Let. 22, 3803 06 1981 , reacted styrene oxide with monohalosilanes, and found that a catalyst was usually necessary. Their most effective catalysts were triphenylphosphine and tetraalkylammonium chlorides. They obtained high yields of products having a silylated hydroxy group at the acarbon and a halogen atom at the carbon. Olah et al., Synthesis, 280 81 1981 , opened epoxide rings with a perfluorinated resin acid catalyst called Nafion H. When the process was carried out in an alcohol, they obtained primarily the product wherein an alkoxy group was at the a carbon position, and a hydroxy at the Carbon position. The present invention provides a process for preparing an amine of the formulaEMI2.1 or an acid addition salt thereof wherein n is 0, 1 or 2 the R groups are the same or different, when n is 2, and are chosen f rom chloro, bromo, fluoro, nitro, C1 C4 alkyl, c1C4.alkoxy, C1 C4 alkylsulfonyl, hydroxy, carboxy, amino, aminocarbonyl, mono or di Cl C4 alkyl amino, or mono or di Cl C4 alkyl amino carbonyl provided that when n is 2, the R groups are not both ortho provided that an alkoxy R group is not para R1 is C3 C8 cycloalkyl, or C3 C8 cycloalkyl mono or disubstituted with C1 C4 alkyl, C1 C4 alkoxy, chloro, bromo or fluoro, Cl C6 alkyl, C1 C6 alkyl substituted with chloro, bromo or fluoro, C1 C6 alkyl monosubstituted with C1 C4 alkoxy, C1 C4 alkanoyl, C1 C4 alkoxycarbonyl, hydroxy, amino, phenyl, or phenyl mono or disubstituted with chloro, bromo, fluoro, nitro, cyano, C1 C4 alkyl,C1 C4 alkoxy, C1 C4 alkanoyl, C1 C4 alkoxycarbonyl, hydroxy, carboxy, amino, aminocarbonyl, mono or di Cl C4 alkyl amino, or mono or di Cl C4 alkyl aminocarbonyl which process comprises reacting an epoxide of the formulaEMI3.1 with a silylated amine of the formulaEMI3.2 wherein R2 and R3 are independently phenyl or C1 C4 alkyl, and R4 is C1 C4 alkyl provided that carboxy, hydroxy, unsubstituted amino and unsubstituted aminocarbonyl groups on the epoxide and the silylated amine are silylated with the groupEMI4.1 in the presence of dimethylsulfoxide or without a solvent to prepare a silylated intermediate of the formulaEMI4.2 and hydrolyzing the silylated intermediate. The novel silylated intermediates depicted above are also provided in one aspect of the invention. In this document, all temperatures are expressed in degrees Celsius. The general chemical terms used in the formula above carry their usual meanings in organic chemistry. For example, the terms C1 C4 alkyl, C1 C4 alkoxy, C1 C4 alkylsulfonyl, C1 C4 alkanoyl, C1 C4 alkoxycarbonyl, C1 C6 alkyl and C3 C8 cycloalkyl refer to such groups as methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, butyl, s butyl, isobutyl, t butyl, methoxy, propoxy, s butoxy, t butoxy, methyl sulfonyl, ethylsulfonyl, isopropylsulfonyl, butylsulfonyl, isobutylsulfonyl, pentyl, hexyl, l methylbutyl, l ethylpropyl, l ethylbutyl, 2 ethylbutyl, formyl, acetyl, propionyl, butyryl, 2 methylpropionyl, methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl, isopropoxycarbonyl, t butoxycarbonyl, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, cyclooctyl and the like.

a silylated intermediate.The following silyl groups are typical of those borne by silylated intermediates. triethylsilyl tributylsilyl dibutylphenylsilyl methyldipropylsilyl diphenylpropylsilyl d iethylphenyl silyl t butyldimethylsilyl isopropyldiethylsilyl methyldiphenylsilyl butylmethylphenyl s ilyl Certain classes of the amines and silylated intermediates prepared by this invention constitute preferred classes. Such classes gain their preferred status because of the amines activity as pharmaceu ticals, and not because of any properties of the present process itself, which is equally useful for preparing all of the products. One preferred class includes the compounds wherein n is 0 or 1, and particularly wherein n is 0, or wherein n is 1 and R is chloro, bromo, fluoro or hydroxy.Another preferred class includes the compounds wherein R1is an alkyl group substituted with phenyl or substituted phenyl. A particularly desirable class includes such compounds wherein the alkyl group is of 3 5 carbon atoms, and especially wherein it is a propyl group substituted with 1 or 2 branching methyl groups. The phenyl ring of such RÚ groups is preferably substituted with hydroxy, aminocarbonyl, alkanoyl or carboxy groups, especially hydroxy or aminocarbonyl groups. The products of the process of this invention are pharmaceuticals, and are useful, as is known in the art, as stimulants and blockers of the D adronergic receptor system, and as cardiovascular agents. See, for example, U.S. Patents 3,816,516, of Cox, 4,000,193, of Lunts et al., 4,066,755, of Lunts, 4,101,759, ofHartley et al., and European Patent Application 0006735, of Ainsworth et al. European Patent Application No. 79301278.2 discloses a group of optically active products of the formulaEMI16.1 wherein R5 is hydrogen or fluorine R6 is hydrogen, methyl or ethyl R7 is hydroxy, C1 C4 al kanoyloxy, aminocarbonyl, methylaminocarbonyl, or C1 C2 alkoxycarbonyl with the limitation that when R6 is hydrogen,R7 is aminocarbonyl, methylaminocarbonyl or C1 C2 alkoxycarbonyl C is an asymmetric carbon atom having the R absolute stereochemical configuration C is an asymmetric carbon atom when R6 is methyl or ethyl, and when asymmetric is of the S absolute stereochemical configuration and the non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof. The above optically active compounds are disclosed to be useful as anti obesity agents. European Patent Application No. 79301280.8 discloses another group of ethylamines, described as inotropic agents used for the treatment of cardiac conditions, of the following formula.EMI17.1 wherein R8 is hydrogen or fluorine Rg is hydrogen or hydroxy R10 is hydrogen, hydroxy, fluorine, aminocarbonyl, methylaminocarbonyl, methoxycarbonyl or acetoxy C and C both are asymmetric carbon atoms having the R absolute stereochemical configuration with the limitation that at least one of R8 and R9 is hydrogen and the non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof. European Patent Application No. 79301281.6 discloses another group of cardiotonic drugs of the inotropic type, having the formulaEMI18.1 wherein R11 is hydrogen or fluorine R12 is hydrogen or hydroxy provided that at least one of R11 and R12 is hydrogen R13 is hydroxy C is an asymmetric carbon atom having the R absolute stereochemical configuration and the nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof. Finally, European Patent Application No.79301282.4 discloses a class of anti tumor compounds having the formula EMI19.1 wherein R14 is hydrogen or fluorine R15 is hydroxy, aminocarbonyl, methylamino carbonyl, dimethylaminocarbonyl, acetylamino or methanesulfonylamino and the non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof. The starting compounds used in the present invention are readily prepared by conventional procedures. As noted above, any free silylatable groups on the starting compounds are to be silylated before the process begins. The silyl groups and the silylating process are as described below in the discussion of silylating the amine starting compound. The process of this invention is used to prepare 2 hydroxy 2 phenylethylamines, and its advantage lies in its ability to give a high degree of ring opening of the epoxide starting compound, to give a high degree of attack at the carbon of the opened epoxide, and to transfer the silyl group to the oxygen atom of the opened epoxide, preventing further reaction at that site. The result of these benefits is seen in the fact that the process of this invention produces excellent yields of the desired products. The present process has no effect on the stereochemistry of its products. When the products have asymmetric centers, the stereochemistry of them is the same as the stereochemistry of the corresponding centers of the starting materials. In this document, if the stereochemistry of specific compounds is not indicated, it will be understood that the natural mixture of stereoisomers is meant. It is not necessary to use a significant excess of either starting material of the present process. As the examples below indicate, the process has usually been operated with a small excess, in the range of about 5 20 , of the styrene oxide, to assure that the more expensive and difficult to obtain silylated amine was fully used. However, the use of an excess of either starting material is not necessary and the process may be effectively operated at stoichiometric proportions. The use of an excess, even a very large excess, of either starting compound is not harmful, however, and such may be used as desired. It will be understood, however, that the preparation of the silylated amine starting compound can be seriously upset by the presence of small amounts of water in the reaction mixture, since silylating agents will consume substantially all available water before they react with any other compound. It is therefore advisable to use very dry starting materials and solvent, to measure the amount of water present, and to add an appropriate excess of silylating agent to take up the water present in the mixture. The reader will understand that very careful drying of the equipment and inert gas blanketing of the reactor are clearly advisable. The amine starting compound used in this invention is silylated with a tri substituted silyl group, such as have often been used before in synthetic organic chemistry. The silyl group bears at least one C1 C4 alkyl group, and the other two substituents on it may be either phenyl or Cd alkyl. The most widely used such silyl group is undoubtedly trimethylsilyl other groups are equally applicable, of course, such as diphenyl t butyl, triethyl, tributyl, propyldiphenyl and the like. The silylated amine is prepared, as will be understood by the ordinarily skilled reader, by simple reaction of the appropriate amine with a suitable silylating agent containing the tri substituted silyl group.Such reagents include, for example,N trisubstituted silylimidazole, N trisubstituted silylacetamide, bis tri substituted silyl acetamide, and N,O bis tri substituted silyl acetamide. Such silylating agents are common commercial products, and the choice of silylating agent used to prepare the silylated amine is not a critical matter. Any such silylating agent will serve. The reaction of this invention is carried out either neat without a solvent or in dimethylsulfoxide, preferably in dimethylsulfoxide. The concentration of the reactants in dimethylsulfoxide, when it is used, is not critical any amount of the solvent great enough to dissolve the reactants is adequate, and there is no need to operate the process more dilute. It has been found convenient to use an amount of dimethylsulfoxide in the range of 300 1000 ml. per g mole, but other amounts of solvent may be used as the operator may find convenient in a given instance. It is preferred to carry out the process at a temperature in the range of about 55 85 . It appears that yields of the desired product are somewhat better when the process is operated at relatively low temperatures the throughput of the process, however, is greater when it is operated at relatively high temperatures to increase the reaction s speed. Thus, the operator must take into account the relative values of high yield and high throughput to his particular circumstances in choosing the optimum temperature, as is usually necessary in organic chemical processes.The process may be operated at temperatures both higher and lower than the preferred range just stated, such as the range from about the ambient tempdrature to about 1000, but it will be found that temperatures below about 550 provide undesirably slow reactions, and that temperatures above about 850 give an amount of by products which will usually be undesirable. Reaction of the epoxide and the silylated amine provides a silylated intermediate, which is the desired product bearing the silyl group of the silylated amine on its hydroxy oxygen. This intermediate is easily hydrolyzed to give the desired product. It is very well known that silyl protecting groups are easily hydrolyzed to remove them from the protected group the usual procedures are used in this process. It is preferred to hydrolyze the silyl group in dilute aqueous or alkanolic acid, most preferably a hydrohalic acid. However, it is entirely possible to hydrolyze the more labile silyl groups in water alone, or in an alkanol alone or in dilute aqueous base. The usual alkanol solvents such as methanol, ethanol, propanol and the like are suitable.For example, reagents such as aqueous hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate, acetic acid and the like are used. Fluoride ion is the most general silyl group cleaving agent and is used even for the few groups, such as diphenyl t butylsilyl, which are resistant to acid hydrolysis. It is preferable to carry out the hydrolysis at a moderate temperature in the range of from about 0 to about 50 , preferably from about the ambient temperature to about 500. When silylated hydroxy, amino and the like groups are on the starting compounds, those silyl groups are also cleanly hydrolyzed in the same step. When the hydrolysis step of the process is carried out under acid conditions, the product will be obtained as a salt of the acid, which may be converted back to the free base, in the usual manner, by treatment under mild basic conditions. The formation of such acid addition salts of pharmaceutical amines is very common and well understood, and so is the conversion to the free base of the compounds. The salts of these compounds are in no way unusual. The periods of time necessary to carry out the process of this invention are highly variable, depending on the temperatures at which the operator chooses to run. When a temperature in the preferred range of about 55 85 is used, typical reaction times are in the range of about 10 48 hours. It will be understood that, of course, the optimum time at a given temperature depends on the relative importance of through put and yield to the operator. The hydrolysis step is quite rapid, and usually reaction times in the range of from a few minutes to a few hours are quite adequate. The examples below provide further information about the reaction times and the results provided thereby. It has been found that it is possible to prepare the silylated amine and to react it with the styrene oxide by simply adding the amine, the silylating agent and the styrene oxide to a reactor all at once. In general, it is advisable to prepare the silylated amine first, and then to add the styrene oxide to it. It is unnecessary to isolate and purify the silylated amine before adding styrene oxide, and it is also unnecessary to isolate the silylated intermediate before it is hydrolyzed. As the examples below indicate, the process goes very well without intermediate isolation, in one pot style. It is relatively easy to distinguish the desired product derived from attack of the styrene oxide from the undesired a isomer. The best distinguishing method is nuclear magnetic resonance nmr analysis in which the 2 methynyl proton of the desired product is seen at about 64.7 in deuterated chloroform with trimethylsilane as the internal standard, as a wellresolved doublet of doublets. The same proton in the undesired product is seen as a multiplet at about 63.43.8, overlapping the signals of the two adjacent protons. Thin layer chromatography on silica has also been characteristic in all cases observed the isomer is the more polar, in chloroform methanol NH4oH systems. The following examples further explain the process of this invention. Example 1 N S 3 4 aminocarbonylphenyl l methyl propyl 3 S 2 hydroxy 2 phenylethylamine A gas tight 3 necked flask was fitted with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer and nitrogen inlet, and was kept under dry nitrogen during all operations of the following process.

The mixture was warmed with stirring to 73 75 , over a period of about 2 hours.The mixture was stirred at 73 750 for 15 hours, to prepare the silylated intermediate, N S 3 4 amino carbonylphenyl l methylpropyl S 2 trimethylsilylOxy 2 phenylethylamine, and was then cooled slowly to about 30 and poured into 600 ml. of l.7N hydrochloric acid, at such a rate as to maintain the acid mixture at 45 50 . The mixture was allowed to stand 20 minutes after the addition, and it was then partitioned with 520 ml. of ethyl acetate. The aqueous layer was separated, and added over a period of about 1 hour to a stirred solution of 104 g. of sodium hydroxide in 2500 ml. of water at about 0 , after which the mixture was cooled to 80 and stirred slowly for another hour.The crude product was then separated by vacuum filtration, washed with three 50 ml. portions of ice water, and pressed as dry as possible. The wet cake was then dissolved in 1000 ml. of acetonitrile at 65 700, 150 ml. of 50 aqueous methanol was added, and the mixture was cooled undisturbed for 3 hours at ambient temperature and then overnight at 00.
