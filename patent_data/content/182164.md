# Precision lock tooling.

## Abstract
A tooling plate for a circuit board drill wherein the locating apertures for the circuit board is located in the plate by the drill. A bushing cavity is provided in the tooling plate at the approximate desired position. An inner bushing having the locating aperature is laterally moveable in the cavity and an alignment pin in the drill chuck is positioned over the inner bushing at the desired location. The inner bushing is laterally adjusted to enable insertion of the align ment pin in the aperature. While being held in the desired position, a lock ring forces a clamping washer against the inner bushing to lock that position of the inner bushing member within the cavity.
