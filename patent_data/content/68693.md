# Production of foot and mouth disease vaccine from microbially expressed antigens.

## Abstract
Polypeptides which act as antigens of foot and mouth disease virus FMDV are produced by microorganisms which have been transformed with plasmids produced using recombinant DNA technology. A suitable plasmid has a gene sequence produced by chemical synthesis or by reverse transcription which encodes a polypeptide comprising one or more immunogenic determinants of one or more FMDV proteins, and optionally a fusion protein preferably linked via a cleavage site, the gene sequence being under the control of a promoter. For example. an E. Coli K12 strain was transformed with plasmid pFM1. This is based on plasmid pBR322, with the DNA sequence of codons 8 to 210 of the VP3 gene of FMDV type A12119ab connected to the LE min protein from pBR322 so as to be in the same reading frame. This assembly is under the control of the E. Coli trp operon. The transformant E. Coli was cultured and caused to express the LE min VP3 fusion protein. This was isolated and shown by competitive radio immunoassay to have similar antigenic properties to purified natural VP3 protein.

## Description
PRODUCTION OF FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE VACCINE FROM MICROBIALLY EXPRESSED ANTIGENS This invention relates to the use of recombinant DNA technology for.the microbial production of foot and mouth disease antigens for use in the preparation of vaccines against foot and mouth disease. In one aspect, the present invention relates to the construction of microbial expression vehicles containing DNA sequences coding for foot and mouth disease antigens operably linked to expression effecting promoter systems and to the expression vehicles so constructed. In another aspect, the present invention relates to microorganisms transformed with such expression vehicles, thus directed in their expression of the DNA sequences referred to above.In yet other aspects, this invention relates to the means and methods of producing end products of such microbial expression and to means and methods of converting such products to entities, such as vaccines, useful against foot and mouth disease.Backqround of the InventionA. Foot and Mouth Disease Antigens Foot and mouth disease FMD is a dreadful, highly contagious disease which affects cloven footed animals, including valuable, domesticated livestock cattle, swine, sheep and goats. its symptoms are manifested as lesions, notably in the mucous membranes of the mouth and on the skin around the hooves. The teats, rumen and myocardium are also frequently involved. Afflicted animals are generally debilitated, as a consequence of lameness and of forced restrictions in eating. Although mortalities are generally low, unless the heart muscle becomes involved., large economic losses are incurred from weight loss and irreversible loss of milk production. In addition, the present methods of preventing transmission of the disease when outbreaks occur, resort to wholesale slaughter of the infected and exposed animals.See the general review by Bachrach, H.L., Viruses and Environment, Academic Press, New York, 1978. Thus, the prevention of outbreaks of foot and mouth disease would be of great economic value. The disease is caused by a virus vector which invades and infects host organism cells, disrupting their useful functions. Within the cell, the viral genome replicates and each copy becomes encapsulated by viral coat protein which is produced within the cell by expression of the appropriate gene codon sequences of the viral RNA.Eventually, the individual cells become loaded with the multiplying virus and burst, discharging the virus entities for infection of neighboring cells.Foot and mouth disease virus FMDV is an acid sensitive animal picornavirus of the rhinovirus genus. It has four primary capsid proteins VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP4 which are thought to have molecular weights of about 30, 30, 27 and 8 kd., respectively. It also has a precursor protein, VPo ca. 41 kd. , of VP2 and VP4. It apparently also has small amounts of a 52 kd. protein as well as tryptic cleavage products VP3a and VP3b. SeePerspectives in Virology 10, Raven Press, New York, 1978, particularly Chapter 10 by Bachrach et al., which is incorporated herein by this reference.The caps it proteins VP1, VP2 and VP3 of fMDV TypeA12 have been purified and used to study immune response by Bachrach et al., The Journal of immunology 115, 1636 1975 . These workers concluded that purified VP3 has an essential immunogenic determinant. They found that purified trypsin sensitive protein sensitized guinea pigs for later inducement of antiviral activity with an immunogenic dose of trypsinized FMDV. See also U.S. Patent 4140763 which, along with The Journal of Immunology 115, 1636 1975 cited above, is hereby incorporated by reference.Although FMD vaccine produced from killed or inactivated virus is available and has been widely used in many parts of the world since it was first developed in the 194ops, it is costly and difficult to produce. Production problems involving proteolytic digestion of the antigenic portions of the virus, contamination of the production media, and low virus yield have plagued producers. There are also problems during the production involving containment of large quantities of highly contagious material. incomplete inactivation of the virus in the vaccine products has caused numerous disease outbreaks. Over inactivation causes severe loss of immunogenic potency. The vaccine preparations themselves are unstable and must be kept cold to prevent further loss of potency.These and other problems are especially acute in the large South American ranches where the availability of present vaccine is most critical.The present invention may provide solutions to all of these problems because the instant process of vaccine production uses no FMD virus and therefore no virus contamination, inactivation or containment problems exist. The microbiological media used to grow the recombinant organismsare much easier to keep free of contaminants and are much cheaper. The product, which consists essentially only of the FMDV antigenic determinants, Is more uniform in effectiveness and potency. The antigenic protein does not inactivate at room temperature therefore, this vaccine should be much more convenient to use in the field. B. Recombinant ONA TechnologyWith the advent of recombinant DNA technology, the controlled bacterial production of useful polypeptides has become possible. The workhorse of recombinant DNA technology is the plasmid, an extra chromosomal loop of double stranded DNA found in bacteria, oftentimes in multiple copies per bacterial cell. Included in the information encoded in the plasmid DNA is that required to reproduce the plasmid in daughter cells i.e., a replicon and ordinarily, one or more selection characteristics, such as resistance to antibiotics, which permit clones of the host cell containing the plasmid of interest to be recognized and preferentially grown in selective media.The utility of plasmids, which can be recovered and isolated from the host microorganism, lies in the fact that they can be specifically cleaved by one or another restriction endonuclease or Nrestriction enzyme, each of which recognizes a different site on the plasmidicDNA. Thereafter heterologous genes or gene fragments may be inserted into the plasmid by endwise joining at the cleavage site or at reconstructed ends adjacent to the cleavage site. As used herein, the term heterologous1 refers to a gene not ordinarily found in, or a polypeptide sequence ordinarily not produced by, the host microorganism whereas the term homologous refers to a gene or polypeptide which is produced in the host microorganism, such as E. coli. DNA recombinatlon is performed outside the microorganisms but the resulting recombinant plasmid can be introduced into microorganisms by a process known as transformation and large quantities of the heterologous gene containing recombinant plasmid obtained by growing the transformant.Moreover, where the gene is properly inserted with reference to portions of the plasmid which govern the transcription and translation of the encoded DNA message, the resulting plasmid or expression vehicle, when incorporated into the host microorganism, directs the production of the polypeptide sequence for which the inserted gene codes, a process referred to as expression.Expression is initiated in a region known as the promoter which is recognized by and bound by RNA polymerase. In some cases, as in the trp operon discussed infra, promoter regions are overlapped by operator regions to form a combined promoter operator. Operators are DNA sequences which are recognized by so called repressor proteins which serve to regulate the frequency of transcription initiation at a particular promoter. The polymerase travels along theDNA, transcribing the information contained in the coding strand from its 5 to 3 end into messenger RNA which is in turn translated into a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence for which the DNA codes. Each amino acid is encoded by a unique nucleotide triplet or codon within what may for present purposes be referred to as the structural gene, i.e. that part which encodes the amino acid sequence of the expressed product.After binding to the promoter, the RNA polymerase first transcribes nucleotides encoding a ribosome binding site, then a translation initiation or start signal ordinarily ATG, which in the resulting messenger RNA becomes AUG , then the nucleotide codons within the structural gene itself.So called stop codons, if present, are transcribed at the end of the structural gene whereafter the polymerase may form an additional sequence of messenger RNA which, because of the presence of the stop signal, will remain untranslated by the ribosomes. Rlbosomes bind to the binding site provided on the messenger RNA, In bacteria ordinarily as the mRNA is being formed, and themselves produce the encoded polypeptide, beginning at the translation start signal and ending at the previously mentioned stop signal. The desired product is produced if the sequences encoding the ribosome binding site are positioned properly with respect to the AUG initiator codon and if all remaining codons follow the Initiator codon in phase.The resulting product may be obtained by lysing the host cell and recovering the product by appropriate purification from other microorganism protein s .C. Promoter Systems As examples1 the beta lactamase and lactose promoter systems have been commonly used to initiate and sustain the microbial production of heterologous polypeptides. Details relating to the make up and construction of these promoter systems have been published by Chang et al., Nature 275, 617 24 1978 and Itakura et al., Science 198, 1056 63 1977 , which are hereby incorporated by reference. More recently, a system based upon tryptophan, the so called trp promoter system, has been developed. Details relating to the makeup and construction of this system have been published by Goeddel et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 8 4057 74 1980 , which is hereby incorporated by reference. The particular trp promoter system has been constructed having a sequence of double stranded DNA comprising a trp promoter. nucleotides coding for the trp leader ribosome binding site, and in phase from a first 5 to a second 3 end of the coding strand, nucleotides encoding translation initiation for expression of a structural gene that encodes the amino acid sequence of the heterologous polypeptide.The DNA sequence referred to contains neither a trp attenuator region nor nucleotides coding for the trp E ribosome binding site. Instead, the trp leader ribosome binding site is efficiently used to effect expression of the information encoded by an inserted gene. Cells are transformed by addition of the trp promoter containing and attenuator lacking plasmids and grown up in the presence of additive tryptophan. The use of tryptophan rich media provides sufficient tryptophan to essentially completely repress the trp promoter through trplrepressor interactions, so that cell growth can proceed uninhibited by premature expression of large quantities of heterologous polypeptide encoded by an insert otherwise under the control of the trp promoter system.When the recombinant culture has been grown to the levels appropriate for industrial production of the polypeptide, on the other hand, the external source of tryptophan is depleted, leaving the cell to rely only on the tryptophan that it can itself produce The result is mild tryptophan limitation and, accordingly, the pathway is derepressed and highly efficient expression of the heterologous insert occurs, unhampered by attenuation because the attenuator region has been deleted from the system. In this manner, the cells are never severely deprived of tryptophan and all proteins, whether they contain tryptophan or not, can be produced in substantial yields. This system is described in more detail by Kleid et al., U.S patent application Serial No. 133. 296, filed March 24, 1980, corresponding to E.P.o. Pubs. No. 0036776, which is hereby incorporated by reference.D. State of the Art Kipper et al., Nature 289, 555 1981 describe the isolation of cUNA fragments derived from the FMUV strain 0, Kaufenbarcn. Boothroyd et al., Nature 290. 800 1981 describe similar experiments with FMDV A10. The DNA coding for the VP1 protein corresponding to VP3 of other workers and herein apparently s included in these cONA fragments. The supper et al. group succeeded in sulcloning some uf the FMDV VP3 gene sequences into an expression vector.In these expression studies. they describe the construction of a plasmid containing the PL promotor. and a portion of the MS2 structural gene in phase sat a Barn Hl site wit i some coding sequences of the FMDV VP1 VP3 gene. This construction incorporates amino acids 9 of the VP1 VP3 structural gene to codon 292 beyond the VP3 gene at a Hind lii site. into the vector pPLc24. The authors claim to have used this plasmid to transform . coil and obtain expression controlled by the phage x PL proctor. They report that some of the transformants may synthesize antigenic material and they estimate production of only 1000 equivalents of antigenic material per cell based on radioinnunoassay using whole bacterial extracts as antigens. The data presented suggests that a substance of unknown antigenic potency was produced in sone bacteria containing this plasmid. However, there is no inforlation on whether the substance produced was immunogenic. presumably because the material is inactive or the amounts obtained were insufficient to conduct in vivo animal tests. See also Kurz et al. Nucleic Acids Research 9, 1919 1981 .Brief Summary of the Invention The present invention is based upon the discovery that recombinant DNA technology can be used to successfully and efficiently produce polypeptides associated with the antigenic determinants of foot and mouth disease. Such polypeptides are produced hereby in amounts sufficient to inoculate animals in standard, challenge bioassays and prove the consequential conferment of immunogenicity to foot and mouth disease. Thus, the present invention provides FMD vaccines based upon the obtention, via recombinant DNA technology, of antigenically active FMDV polypeptides in amounts and purities sufficient to confer immunogenicity in susceptible animals. The FMDV polypeptides described herein are microbially produced, in accordance with the present invention, both as 1 stable fusion products which are, in one preferred embodiment, used directly as immunogens or are specifically cleavable to provide immunogenic polypeptides unaccompanied by polypeptide associated with either a precursor to the mature FMDV protein s or the protein s of the particular promoter microbial system employed, or 2 products of direct expression not requiring subsequent processing to provide the mature FMDV poypeptide s . The present invention is also directed to the production of polyantigenic FMDV polypeptides containing the major antigenic determinant s of one or severalFMDV types and subtypes, from functional microbial expression vehicles having tandem gene sequences coding for multiple copies of one or more of such polypeptides in specifically cleavable form. In any event, the expression products of the present invention containing an immunogenically active constituent of FMDV are microbially produced, recovered and purified to levels required for use in preparing vaccines against FMD. Because the proteins hereof are tticroblaily produced, they are free of extrancous viral proceins which accompany product purified from natural sources. However, the microbial organism employed produces its own proteins which may accompany the desired protein and, after purification, be present in the product in amounts upwards of about five percent by weight.It has been found that these levels do not affect the immunogenicity of the final product and are tolerable in the finished vaccine. Because the microbial proteins are not considered to affect vaccine utility, the final product is undefined in terms of structure and total amount of the microbial proteins. In addition, while the natural FMDV proteins are phosphoproteins cf. LaTorre et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77, 7444 1980 , the microbially produced protein counterparts are not phosphoproteins because the microorganisms lack the enzymes required for protein phosphorylation. The present invention comprises the FMDV polypeptide s so produced and the methods and means of producing them.Specifically, the present invention is directed to FMDV polypeptide s comprising the amino acid sequence of at least one immunogenic determinant of mature FMDV protein s , microbially produced and in amounts sufficient to confer FMD immunogenicity in susceptible animals. The FMDV polypeptide s produced hereby optionally contain s a specific cleavage site and optionally linked thereto an additional polypeptide sequence derived from the microbially operable promoter system employed or from syntheticDNA.The present invention is further directed to synthetically derived organic synthesis and or reverse transcription gene sequences coding for the polypeptide s described above and to replicable microbial expression vehicles harboring said gene sequences in expressible form so that said vehicles are capable of expressing said polypeptide s . Further, the present invention is directed to microorganisms transformed with the expression vehicles described above and to microbial cultuz es of such transformed microorganisms, capable of producing the polypeptide s described above. In still further aspects, the present invention is directed to various processes useful in preparing said polypeptide s , gene sequences, expression vehicles, microorganisms and cultures and to specific embodiments thereof.Still further, this invention is directed to the preparation of vaccines useful to confer immunogenicity to FMD in susceptible animals, which incorporate the polypeptide s descr ibed above, and to the vaccines thus produced. and to the method of using them to inoculate and confer immunogenicity toFMD in susceptible animals. The term mature FMDV protein , as used herein, means all antigenically variable strains, types and subtypes of FMD, regardless of origin, unaccompanied by presequence protein or other leader protein not associated with or critical to the antigenically operable character of the viral protein. Such protein contains at least one antigenic determinant of FMDV.Brief Description of Drawinqs Figure 1 parts a, b and c depicts a series of overlapping cloned cDNA molecules produced using each of twelve different Foot and Mouth Disease Virion RNA molecules as templates for reverse transcriptase.

The cattle were vaccinated with the amounts shown in the figure and antibody titers measured over a five month period. The titers are measured by methods described infra. FMD Vaccine This invention relates to a method whereby antigenic polypeptide s of FMDV are produced in useful quantities from microorganisms transformed with specific functional expression vehicles. The utility of this invention is manifest in the production of these polypeptides, the use of them to prepare FMD vaccines, and the subsequent application of these polypeptides, in the form of vaccines, for the prevention of FMD in susceptible animals. The embodiments of this invention demonstrate that these polypeptide s possess the desired antigenic properties. These polypeptides are isolated from the microorganisms in which they are produced and purified, optionally with prior cleavage, such as with cyanogen bromide, if fusion polypeptide s are produced. The vaccines of the present invention, incorporating a FMDV polyPeptide s produced as herein described, can be prepared according to known methods, wherein said polypeptide s is are combined in admixture with a suitable vehicle. Suitable vehicles include, for example, saline solutions, various known adjuvants, or other additives recognized in the art for use in compositions applied to prevent viral infections. Such vaccines will contain an effective amount of the polypeptide s hereof and a suitable amount of vehicle in order to prepare a vaccine useful for effective administration to the host. Attention is also directed to New Trends and Developments in Vaccines, Editors A. Voller and H. Friedman, University Park Press, Baltimore, 1978, which is hereby incorporated by reference, for further background details on the preparation of vaccines. Because of the unique methods by which the active component of these vaccines are produced, vaccines hereof are likely to be substantially free of extraneous FMD protein s and of other viral and cellular components. Therefore, they are less likely to produce the complications of whole killed or attenuated virus vaccine preparations. The invention, in its preferred embodiments, is described with reference to E. coli, including not only E. coli K 12 strain 294, defined above, but also other known E. coli strains such asE. coli x 1776 and E. coli B, or other microbial strains, many of which are deposited and potentially available from recognized microorganism depository institutions, such as the American TypeCulture Collection ATCC cf. the ATCC catalogue listing. See also German Offenlegungsschrift 2644432. These other microorganisms include, for example, Bacilli such as Bacillus subtilis and other enterobacteriaceae among which may be mentioned as examples Salmonella typhimurium and Serratla marcesans, utilizing plasmids that can replicate and express heterologous gene sequences in these organisms.Yeast, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, may also be employed to advantage as host organism in expressing the proteins, under the control of a yeast promoter.See the copendihg U.S. patent application by Ronald Hitzeman et al., U.S. Serial No. 237913, filed February 25, 1981, or the corresponding European Patent Application 82300949 3, which are incorporated herein by reference. Thus, the invention is not to be limited to the preferred e biments described.Detailed DescriptionA. Synthesis of double stranded cDNA The genoine of the Foot and Mouth disease virus FMDV consists of a single stranded RNA molecule of approximately 8,000 nucleotides.

The nucleotide sequence at these sites was determined from a cloned FMDVA12 119 ab cDNA segment, T465, obtained as described below.The primer RNA annealing and double stranded cDNA synthesis was carried out as follows. Ethanol precipitatedFMDV RNA 5 10 g was combined with 1 5 pg primer in 6 ulH20, 5 pl of 0.1 M Tris pH 8, 5 Ljl 10 mM EDTA and 29 pl H20 final volume of 45 iil. This was heated to 95 for 5 min, then frozen on dry ice. Added to this was 0.1 mCi a 32P dATP dissolved in 50 ul of a solution containing 100 mM Tris HCl pH 8, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 m s mercaptoethanol, 0.3 M NaCl, 2 mM dATP, 2 mM dCTP, 2 mM dGTP, and 2 mM dTTP. As the solution was melting, 6 pl of reverse transcriptase 90 units was added.After 1 hr incubation at 42 C the reaction was heated to 95 C for 5 min then cooled to 0 and a 100 ul solution containing 50 mM KH2PO4 pH 7.4, 7 mM MgCl2, 2 mM B mercaptoethanol was added followed by 20 ul DNA polymerase I, Klenow fragment 10 units .

The general methods used to accomplish this have been published, for example M.P. sickens et al., J. Biol. Chem. 253, 2483 2495 1978 , D.V. Goeddel et al., Nature 281, 544 548 1979 . Thirty ng cDNA was dissolved in 40 u1 H20 and combined with 5 ul 1 M sodium cacodylate buffer pH 7.2, 1 vl of 0.05 N CoCl2, 5 ul of 10 10 mM dCTP and then treated with 0.5 ul terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase 15 units for 5 min at 37 C. The solution was phenol extracted, chloroform extracted, ethanol precipitated and combined with 300 ng pBR322 previously cut with Pst I and tailed with dGTP. This was diluted into 100 ul of annealing solution containing 0.1 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.6, 0.25 mM EDTA heated to 70 C, then allowed to cool slowly in a water bath to to 37 C overnight. After 1 hr at room temperature 50 ul of this solution was used to transform competent E. coli K12 strain 294 by standard procedures. The bacteria were spread on tetracycline containing agar plates then colonies screened for ampicillin resistance. The colonies that were tcR apS 95 percent were grows in 3 ml culture and plasmids isolated and inserts characterized by restriction enzyme mapinq. A summary of the data generated by a series 3 overlapping cDNA inserts is shown in Figure 1. In some experiments, a 32P labelled DNA fragment coding for the amino terminal part of the VP3 gene, derived from the plasmid FMDV Alp T465, was used in a filter hybridization assay. Samples of the plasmid preparations were applied to nitrocellulose filters and hybridized to the labelled fragment according to Grunstein and Hogness Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 72, 3961 3965 1975 . Plasmids containing VP3 gene sequences from the various FMDV strains were identified using this assay. The VP3 genes were further characterized by DNA squencin. A compilation of the VP3 gene sequences for types A12, A24, A27, A arg 74, C3, 01C and 01K is shown in Figure 2, parts a and b.C. Expression of antigenic proteins of the FMD virus. As shown in Figure 1, several of the cDNA inserts contained the FMDV genomic sequences of the immunogenic VP3 protein H.L. Bachrach et al., P. Immun. 115, 1635 1641 1975 . DNA molecules have been cleaved from these inserts using restriction endonucleases and those sequences coding for the immunogenic protein attached to plasmid vectors designed to transcribe the DNA molecules and translate the RNA into protein. Each of these plasmid vectors, or expression vectors, Is designed to produce the antigenic protein product in a different form 1 the antigenic protein expressed as a fusion protein. 2 the antigenic protein expressed directly, 3 the antigenic protein expressed as a polyantigen containing several FMDV antigenic sites expressed as a continuous polyprotein. Other plasmids were designed to express te antigenic VP3 protein of other FMDV types and subtypes 4 the antigenic VP3 protein from FMDV A24 Cruzeiro Brazil 55 expressed as a fusion protein, 5 the antigenic VP3 protein from FMDV A27 Cundinamarca Columbia 76 expressed as a fusion protein, 46 the antigenic VP3 protein fromFMDV A Argentina 79 expressed as a fusion protein, 7 the antigenic VP3 protein from FMDV C3 Resende Brazil55 expressed as a fusion protein, 8 the antigenic VP3 protein from 1 Campos Brazil 58 expressed as a fusion protein. 1 The antigenic protein expressed as a fusion protein.The plasmids or expression vectors used to express fusion proteins from the FMDV genes were similar to those utilized previously for the production of somatostatin and the human insulin A and B chains see Kleid et al., U.S.S.N. 133,296, filed March 24, 1980, or the corresponding European AppliApplication 81301227,5 published under Serial No.0036776, which are hereby incorporated by reference . In these examples and in the present case the tryptophan operator promoter is used to express a fusion protein derived from a portion of the tryptophan operon specifically the first 9 amino acids of the trp leader peptide and the last one third of the trp E protein theLE gene . This gene sequence is ultimately derived from the E. coli tryptophan operon containing the attenuator deletion trp oLE 1413 G.F. Miozzari et al., J.Bacteriology, 1978, 1457 1466 . The construction of these expression vectors is described in detail in Kleid et al.,Supra. Attached to this gene e.g. LE , and in the same reading frame, is the gene for the antigenic sites of the FNDV e.g. VP3 . In order to obtain joining of these two genes in the correct reading frame, a linker DNA molecule has been constructed. The expression vehicle can be described as consisting of 5DNA fragments joined together with T4 DNA ligase using standard procedures and cloned by transformation of E. coliK12 strain 294. The five fragments have been joined in the configuration shown below EMI23.1 The joined DNA fragments 3 and 4, as well as 5 and 1 are connected by an EcoRI site, whereas fragments 2 and 3 are isolated from the trp operon joined. Between fragments 4 and 5 there is a Pstl site. The junction between fragments 2 and 1 Is a filled in EcoRI site filled in using DNA polymerase I under standard conditions and a Pstl site treated with DNA polymerase I to create a blunt end joined together with DNA ligase. The joined ends give the sequence CAATTC.DNA fragment 1. This DNA molecule is 3611 base pairs in length and contains the first 3611 nucleotides of the plasmid pBR322. The complete nucleotide sequence of this molecule has been reported J.G. Sutcliffe, Cold SpringHarbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 43, 79 1979 . This fragment begins with an EcoRI site, contains the tetracycline resistance gene of pBR322, the origin of replication and a portion of the e lactamase gene, up to the Pst I site.This cleavage site has been removed by DNA polymerase I nuclease activity using standard conditions. DNA fragment 2. Fragment 2 contains the promoter and operator of the E. coli tryptophan operon and ends one nucleotide before the ATG initiation codon of the trp L peptide.

This DNA molecule contains the first 15 codons of the LE fusion protein and is normally linked to fragment 2. The Bgl II recognition sequence at this site has been modified and converted into an Eco RI site.

The coding sequence from most of the A24 VP3 gene was joined to the plasmid In place of the corresponding A12 VP3 coding sequence. This was accomplished as follows 1 The plasmid pFM3 was cleaved with Hindlil and BamHI. The long DNA fragment containing most of the tcR gene, the pBR322 origin most of DNA fragment 1 , the trp promoter and operator DNA fragment 2 , the short LE fusion gene DNA fragment 3a , the synthetic VP3 gene fragment DNA fragment 4a and codons 10 44 of the FMDV A12 VP3 gene, was isolated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.The pldsmid insert 8435 see Figure 1 was digested with Hindlil and partially digested with HaelII to give a 533 base pair DNA fragment from the FMDV A24 VP3 gene coding for amino acids 44 220 about 7 beyond the end of the VP3 gene . This was isolated by polyacrylamide gel.3 The plasmid pBR322 fragment 1 was digested with EcoRI, treated with DNA polymerase I Klencw fragment, to fill in the EcoRI end, then treated with BamHI. The 375 base pair fragment was isolated by polyacrylamide gel. 4 The three fragments 1, 2 and 3 were combined, joined with T4 DNA ligase and the mixture used to transform E. coli to tcR.The identical plasmid was isolated from several colonies and shown to contain the correct arrangment of DNA fragments.The amino acid sequence of the expressed protein is shown below as deduced from the nucleotide sequence.Fusion protein expressed from pFMBI FMDV A24 . 1 10 met lys ala ile phe val leu lys g ly ser leu asp arg asp proAUG AAA GCA AUU UUC GUA CUG AAA GGU UCA CUG GAC AGA GAU CCA 20 30 glu phe met thr thr ala thr gly glu ser ala asp pro val thrGAA UUC AG ACU ACU GCU ACU GGU GAA UCU GCA GAC CCU GUC ACC 40 thr thr val glu asn tyr gly gly glu thr gln val gln arg argACC ACC GUG GAG AAC UAC GGU CCU GAG ACA CAA GUC CAG ACA CGU 50 60 his his thr asp val ser phe ile met asp arg phe val lys ileCAC CAC ACG GAC GUC AGU UUC AUC AUG GAC AGA UUU GUG AAG AUA 70AAA AGC UUG AGC CCA ACA CAU 6UC AUU GAC CUC AUG CAG ACU CAC lys ser leu ser pro thr his val ile asp leu met gln thr his 80 90 gln his gly leu val gly ala leu leu arg ala ala thr tyr tyrCAA CAC GGU CUG GUG GGU GCC UUG CUG CCU GCA GCC ACG UAC UAC 100 phe ser asp leu glu ile val val arg his glu gly asn leu thrUUU UCU GAC UUG GAA AUU GUU GUA CGG CAC GAA GGC AAU CUG ACC 110 120 trp val pro asn gly ala pro glu ser ala leu leu asn thr serUGG GUG CCC AAC GGC GCC CCU GAA UCA GCC CUG UUG AAC ACC AGC 130 asn pro thr ala tyr asn lys ala pro phe thr arg leu ala leuAAC CCC ACU GCC UAC AAC AAG GCA CCA UUC ACG AGA CUC GCU CUC 140 150 pro tyr thr alma pro his arg val ser ala thr val tyr asn glyCCC UAC ACU CCC CCC CAC CCU GUG UCC GCA ACA GUG UAC AAC CCC 160 thr ser lys tyr ala val gly gly ser gly arg arg gly asp metACG AGU AAG UAU GCU GUG GGU CCU UCA GGC AGA CCU GGC GAC AUG 170 180 gly thr leu ala ala arg val val lys gln leu pro ala ser phe CCC ACU CUC CCC CCC CCA GUC GUG AAA CAG CUU CCU GCU UCA UUU 190 asn tyr gly ala ile lys ala asp ala ile his glu leu leu valAAC UAC GGU GCA AUC AAG GCC GAC GCC AUC CAC GAA CUU CUC GUG 200 210 arg met lys arg ala glu leu tyr cys pro arg pro leu leu alaCGC AUG AAA CCC GCC GAG CUC UAC UCC CCC AGA CCC CUG CUG GCA 220 ile glu val ser ser gin asp arg his lys gln lyes ale ile alaAUA GAG GUG UCU UCG CAA GAC AGG CAC AAG CAA AAG AUC AUU GCA 230 240 pro ala lys gln leu leu asn phe asp leu leu lys leu glu pheCCA GCA AAG CAG CUU CUG AAU UUU GAC CUG CUC AAG UUG GAA UUC 248 ser cys leu thr ala tyr his arg OCUCA UGU UUC ACA GCU UAU CAU CGA UAA 5 The antigenic VP3 protein from FMDV A27Cundinamarca Columbia 76 expressed as a fusion protein. The plasmid construction used to express a fusion protein containing the antigenic sites of the VP3 from strainFMDV A27 was the same as that used in pFM3. The coding sequence for the A27 gene was obtained from the insertC312 see Figure 1 in two DNA fragments. The first part of the gene was obtained by treating the plasmid insertC312 with PstI then isolating the 900 base pair Insert.This fragment was combined and annealed with a synthetic oligonucleotide, 32P CATGACCACTGTCA, complementary to this first three codons of the VP3 gene and adding a synthetic met codon prior to the gene. The primer was elongated with DNA polymerase Klenow fragment and made blunt ended at the primer due to the 3 to 5 exonuclease and repair activities of the polymerase using the procedure described by Goeddel et al., Nucleic Acids Research 8, 4057 4074 1980 . The mixture was treated with Sacl and a 580 base pair radiolabelled fragment isolated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This DNA fragment contains CATG followed by the first 182 codons of the FMDVA27 VP3 gene.The second part of the gene was isolated from insert C312 by treatment with Sacl and EcoRI under low salt conditions such that the sequence, GAATTT an EcoRI site at the final codon of the VP3 gene, was cleaved. The 90 base pair fragment was isolated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This fragment was ligated into pBR322 previously treated with Pstl and EcoRI and the large fragment DNA fragment 1 isolated. The 90 base pair fragment was combined with a Pstl Sacl DNA fragment obtained from C312. The ligation, followed by transformation into E. coli, gave a plasmid, pBRA27.From this plasmid a Sacl to BamHI fragment was isolated containing the last 30 codons of the FMDV A27 VP3 gene connected to 375 base pairs of pBR322 containing the beginning of the tcR gene. This DNA fragment was combined with the first part of the VP3 gene, isolated above using the primer reaction, and this combined with the expression vector. The expression vector, derived from pFM3 contains most of the tcR gene, the pBR322 origin most of DNA fragment 1 , the trp promoter and operator DNA fragment 2 , and the short LE fusion DNA fragment 3a . The vector was previously treated with EcoRI and DNA polymerase I to create a blunt end at the end of the short LE fusion see sequence of fragment 3a , followed by treatment with DamHI and Isolation by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.The three DNA fragments were treated with T4 DNA ligase and used to transform E. coli. The plasmid pFMC was isolated and shown to contain the correct arrangement of fragments. The amino acid sequence of the expressed protein is shown below as deduced from the nucleotide sequence.

The first part of the gene was obtained by the same primer extension, SacI cleavage reaction used forA27. The primer used in A Argentina 79 was 32p CATGACTACCCCCA and the 522 base pair fragment obtained was ligated into pFM3 previously treated with EcoRI, DNA polymerase I, and BamHI as described for pFMC. These two fragments were combined with a Sacl BamHI fragment from pFMB containing the last 100 base pairs of the A24 VP3 gene and the first 375 base pairs of the Tc R gene.The three joined fragments were used to transform E. coli toTcR and from this the plasmid pFMF 1 obtained In order to reconstruct the complete coding sequence of the AArgentina 79 VP3 gene, this plasmid was cleaved with Sacl and HindlIl and the large fragment isolated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This fragment was combined with two more fragments, a Sacl BstN1 40 base pair fragment containing codons 174 to 186 of the A Argentina 79 and a BstN1 HindilI 105 base pair fragment containing codons 187 to 211 of the A12 VP3 gene and the pBR322 sequence from EcoRI to Hindlil. These three fragments were joined by ligation and used to transform E. coli.

The coding sequence for the C3 Resende VP3 gene was obtained from the insert 0250 see Table 1 again in two DNA fragments. The first part of the gene was obtained by the same primer extension reaction described for A27 using the primer P CATGACCACTG. This primer codes for an initial C followed by codon two which is a met through five of the C3 VP3 gene. Following the primer extension reaction, the DNA mixture was treated withBstEII to give a 240 base pair fragment containing the second through the 75th codon of the VP3 gene. To obtain the second part of the gene the insert D250 was cleaved with Pst and Thal.The Thai cleaves at codon 204 of theC3 VP3 gene. This fragment was joined to pBR322 previously treated with EcoRI, DNA polymerase, and Psti and used to transform E. coli By treating the resulting plasmid with BstEII and BamHI a DNA fragment containing the codons 75 205 of the C3 VP3 gene connected to the first 375 bp of the pBR322 was obtained. This latter fragment was combined with the product of the primer extension reaction and joined to the vector. The vector was the same fragment used in the construction of pFMC and pFMF 1 described above. These joined fragments were used to transform E. coli to TcR.

The 620 base pair fragment isolated contained codons 8 through 213 of theVP3 gene. The Pstl site in the vector pFM3 at codon 8 was converted to a 8g111 site.This was done by ligating the synthetic oligonucleotide 5 GATCTGCA to the Pst cleaved plasmid followed by treatment with BglII, The plasmid was then cleaved with Aval to give the pBR322 origin of replication, the trp operator and promoter DNA fragment 2 , the short LE fusion DNA fragment 3a , the synthetic codons of the FMDV A12 gene DNA fragment 4a and terminating in a sequence suitable for ligation of aBamHI end. When joined to the 620 base pair fragment isolated from the G85 Insert, and a 1424 base pair fragment obtained by digesting plasmid pBR322 with EcoRI and Aval, this construction recreates the natural Ol Campos VP3 sequence from codons 5 through 213. Thus the vector and the Ol Campos VP3 coding sequence were joined by ligation and used to transform E. coli to TcR.

Isolation of Antigenic Proteins from E. coli K12 containing Expression Vectors. The expression vectors described above have been incorporated into E. coli hosts, e.g. K 12 294, ATCC o. 31446, K 12 RV 308, ATCC No. 31608, and K 12 W3110, ATCC Ho. 27325. 1 The isolation and properties of the fusion protein expressed from the c. coli K12 294 pFM1 are presented here in detail. The recoobinant E. coli was grown to A550 1 in LB riedium Miller, J.H., Experiments in Molecular Genetics, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, 1972 containing 5 g nl tetracyclfne. The culture 40 ml was diluted into 800 ml of M9 media bid containing, per liter, 1 ml of 1 M MgS04, 25 ml of 20 percent glucose, 25 ml of 20 percent casamino acids and 0.1 ml of 1 percent thiamine. This was grown at 37wC to A550 2 and the bacteria collected by centrifugation, at 5000 rpm for 15 min. at 4 . The bacteria were resuspended in C0 ml of 50 mii Tris HCl pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.3 M IJaCl TEN then treated on ice for 15 min with lysozyme 1 mg ml and made 0.2 percent in NP 40.After 10 min the sable was diluted to 200 ml and made 0.9 M in NaCl then treated with DNase 0.002 mg ml final concentration and HgCl2 5 mM final concentration for 10 min. The precipitated protein was recovered by centrifugation 5000 rpn for 15 min. at 4 and resuspended and washed with 30 ml TEN three times. The precipitated protein totaled 450 mg by Lowery assay approximately 45 percent of the total protein and much of this 170 mg, approximately 17 percent of the total protein was the LE VP3 fusion protein as determined by P.A.G.E. analytical scanning.Figure 4 shows an SOS P.A.G.E. analysis of the LE VP3 fusion protein. Each sample is shown in pairs. the first lane of the pair shows the total bacterial protein stained with Coomassie blue and the second lane of the pair shows an experiment where the protein was transferred to CNBr treated paper and exoosed to I125 labelled antibody toVP3.This was carried out using a modification of the colony screening method of Hitzeman et al. in Eucaryotic GeneRegulation 14, 57 68 Academic Press, N.Y. 1979 . The polyacrylamide slab gel 1.27 mm thick 9x14 cm of 12.5 percent acrylamide containing 8 M urea Maizel, J V. inMethods in Virolooy Vol. 5, pp 179 246, Academic Press, NY was washed 30 min in 2 changes of phosphate buffered saline PBS solution This was placed on CNBr activated paper Hitzeman et al., J. Biol. Chem. 255, 12073 12080 1980 , for one hour at room temperature. The gel was later stained using Coomassie blue. The paper was then treated in PBS containing 0.1 M glycine, and 0.2 percent BSA at 37 C for 4 hrs alternatively 18 hrs at 4 C , then washed in PBS for 10 min.The paper was then placed in a plastic base and treated for 1 hr at 37 C with 5 percent guinea pig serum in PBS. This was drained and 7.5x106 up to 10x106 cpm 1251 guinea pig IgC specific for VP3 in 10 ml 5 percent guinea pig serum in PBS was added. The VP3 specific antibody was iodinated using 100 pg IgG, 10 ug Iodogen, 500 pCi 125I Na I for 15 min at room temperature, followed by G25 sephadex chromatography .After 4 hrs at room temperature the filter was washed with 30 ml of 5 percent guinea pig serum in PBS for 1 hr, then rinsed 2 times with 200 cl PBS for 18 hr. The filter was blotted and air dried then exposed to X ray film using an intensifying screen at 60 C. Figure 4 shows in lanes 1, la E coli 294, lanes 2, 2aE. coli 294 pFM control. The FMDV VP3 sequences are attached to the expression vector in the incorrect reading frame , lanes 3, 3a pFM1 partially induced for fusion protein expression not grown up such that the tryptophan operon was completely induced , lanes 4, 4a pFM1 fullyInduced, lanes 5, 5a FMDV A12 119 ab VP1, VP2, VP3 1405 capsids .The fusion protein was purified two times by SDS P.A.G.E.using a 1 cm thick 10 percent slab gel in 8 M urea H.L. Bachrach et al., Virology 52, 520 528 1973 H.D. Matheka and H.L. Bachrach, 3. Virology 16, 1248 1253 1975 . The protein containing bands were visualized by chilling the gel H.L. Bachrach, Analyt. Biochem 110, 349 359 1981 and the bands were cut out and protein recovered by electroelution or pulverization Braatz, J.A., and Mclntire, K.P., Prep. Biochem 7, 495 509 1972 . The PAGE gel slurry was taken up in Tris glycine buffer pH 8.3 and 0.1 percent SDS containing 0.05 M B mercaptoethanol. This was heated to 100 C for 5 min to insure no contamination of infectious FMDV viral particles. 2 The Isolation of fusion protein expressed from theE. coli K12 W31101pFM3 is presented here in detail. Approximately 240 gms of wet cell paste cells grown in a 10 liter fermentor were suspended in 2 liters of SucroseLysis Buffer SLB 10 percent Sucrose, 50 mM Tris, 0.2 M Natl, 100 mM EOTA, pH 7.8 . Lysozyme 1 mglml was added to the suspension. This was sonicated for three 9 minute periods in a stainless steel beaker cooled with an ice bath.Centrifugation at 12 K RPM for 40 minutes at 4 C yielded 80 grams of wet pellet which was resuspended in 1.5 liters Urea 8 buffer 8.0 M Urea, 0.014 M Tris HCl, 1.0 percent SME at pH 8.4 . The sonication step can be replaced with a Manton Gaulin milling procedure. The solution was stirred for 2 1 2 hours at 4 C with 375 g DE52 Cellulose previously equilibrated with Urea 6 buffer 6.0 MUrea, 0.014 M Tris HCl, 1.0 percent BME at pH 8.4 . After filtration the supernatant was combined with 1 kg of previously equilibrated CM52 Cellulose in Urea 6 buffer and after 3 hours the supernatant was collected. The resin was washed with an additional liter of Urea 6 buffer.The resin was resuspended in 1 liter of Urea 6 buffer 0.4 M in NaCl, then stirred 12 hours at 4 C and the resulting supernatant collected. The supernatant was concentrated from 1.0 liter to 100 ml on a YM10 Amicon membrane. A sample was dialyzed versus Urea 6 buffer to remove NaCl and applied to a CM52 column 2.2 x 24 cm equilibrated with Urea 6 buffer. The column was eluted with 0 to o.l M NaCl gradient in Urea 6 buffer and the fractions containing the fusion protein were combined.This material was greater than 90 percent pure as Judged bySDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. E. Antigenicity of the Fusion Protein Expressed from pFM1The fusion protein from pFM1 LE VP3 was compared by radioimmunoassay with the purified virion protein VP3 for ability to compete with 1251 labelled 140S virion capsids for VP3 specific antibody. The VP3 protein or the fusion protein was taken up in 6 M urea, 0.1 NI s mercaptoethanol and 0.014 Tris HCl pH 8.6. The amount of protein added to each assay varied from 30 to 0.2 femtomoles see Table 5 below . The assay solution consisted of 0.4 ml guinea pig antiserum for VP3 in an isotonic borate buffered saline solution. Per liter this solution contains 7.4 gm Boric Acid, 7.6 gm sodium tetraborate, 4.38 gm NaCl, and is 0.005 percent sodium azide, 0.001 M KI, 0.02 percent BSA at pH 8.1 .After 1 hr at room temperature 0.1 ml of a solution containing 1251 labelled 140S capsids these molecules comprise the VP1, VP2 and VP3 proteins of FMDV was added. After 1 hr at room temperature Staphylococcus cells 0.2 ml of a 1 percent suspension in borate buffer was ad ded to precipitate the antibody antigen complex Kessler, S.W., J.Immun. 177, 1482 1490 1976 . After 15 min at room temperature the mixture was centrifuged, the supernatant removed and the radioactivity in the pellet determined.Table 5 and Figure 5 show the results of this analysis.From this data it appears that the fusion protein LE VP3 and the VP3 protein possess similar antigenic properties in this competition assay.

Vaccine Preparation with fusion protein from pFM1 Esee 0 1. The vaccine was prepared as a 50 50 oil adjuvant aqueous emulsion. One dose of test vaccine consisted of 3.5 ml of gel slurry material containing 250 ug of LE VP3 from pFM1 combined with 3.5 ml incomplete Freund type ail Marcol 52 oil, Arlacel A 10 percent, Emulugin 05 1 percent . The positive control vaccine contained 140 9 of purified VP3 in the same 50 50 emulsion described above.G. Vaccine Preparation with fusion protein from pFM3 Esee 0 2. The vaccine was prepared as described above in 50 50 oil adjuvant aqueous emulsion using the purified fusion protein from pFM3 dissolved in 8M urea. The vaccine was prepared in different dosage forms 10 pg protein per sample, 50 ug protein per sample, 250 pg protein per sample and 1250 tig protein per sample.H. Innocuity Test The LE VP3 vaccine and samples of the purified VP3 vaccine were tested to insure that the test vaccines did not contain any virulent FMD virus. Samples of the inoculant were safety tested in 6 susceptible bovine by the method of Henderson J. Hyg. 50, 182 192 1952 . Each bovine was inoculated intradermalingually at 20 sites with a total of 2 ml of inoculum. These animals were kept and observed for evidence of FMD for 14 days.I. Seroloqy of animals vaccinated with fusion protein from pFM1 F. Serum samples of 6 bovine and 2 porcine inoculated with LE VP3 250 ug in 7 ml 50 50 aqueous oil adjuvant and 2 bovine inoculated with VP3 140 vg in 7 ml of 50 50 aqueous oil adjuvant were collected at day 7, 14, 28, 35 and 42 post vaccination. The animals were revaccinated. on the 28th day. The titers of the neutralizing FMDV antibodies in these serums was determined bythesuckling mice protection assay of Skinner Proceedings 15th International Veterinary Congress, Part 1, Vol. 1, p. 195 1952 . The neutralizing antibody titers PD50 are expressed as the log of the reciprocal of the dilution calculated to protect 50 percent of the mice. That is, if a 1 1000 dilution of the serum protects 50 percent of the mice the titer is 3.0. Inoculants were prepared each containing 200 LD50 units of virus combined with an equal volume of the various serum dilutions. 0.03 ml of these inoculants were used for injecting the animals Table 6 Serological results of vaccinated animals.

J. Serology of animals vaccinated with fusion protein from pFM3 C. Serum samples from 36 bovine four groups of 9 each inoculated with vaccine prepared from chromatographically purified fusion protein from pFM3, were collected on day 14, 21, 35, 56, 84, 112, 126 and 146 post vaccination. Each of the four groups was vaccinated with a different amount of protein. Group 1 received 10 pg on day 1 and 10 ug on day 112 Group 2 received 50 pg on day 1 and 50 wg on day 112 Group 3 received 250 ug on day 1 and Group 4 received 1250 ig on day 1. The serum samples were measured for the amount of neutralizing antibody induced using the Skinner suckling mouse assay. The results are shown in Figure 6 and give the median log10 PD50 for each of the cattle groups. These results indicate that a significant titer of antibody is induced, and this level lasts several months.K. Serology of animals vaccinated with fusion protein from pFMG 01 Campos Brazil58 Samples of protein from the pFMG 01 Campos plasmid construction were prepared by a method similar to that described for pFM3. These samples were formulated in two dosage forms, 100 ug and 500 pg and administered into guinea pigs on day 1 and day 14. These samples were compared to similar samples containing 0.2 percent SDS, and also compared to virion isolated VP3 from Ol Campos. Guinea pig serum taken on day 35 and 56 was tested for Ol Campos neutralizing antibody in the Skinner suckling mouse assay. The results shown below in Table 7 indicate that a significant titer of antibody is induced and that the levels are comparable to that obtained with the natural VP3 from Ol Campos.

Serology of animals vaccinated with fusion protein from pFMB1 A24 Cruzeiro BraziliSS Samples of protein from the pFMB1 A24 Cruzeiro plasmid construction were prepared by a method similar to that described for pFM3. These samples were formulated in two dosage forms, 100 ug and 500 ug and administered into guinea pigs single dose . These samples were compared to similar samples containing 0.2 percent SDS. Guinea pig serums taken on day 35 were tested for A24 Cruzeiro neutralizing antibody in the Skinner suckling mouse assay. The results shown below in Table 8 indicate that a significant titer of antibody is induced.

Challenge of Immunity The challenge tests were done according to McKercher et al., Arch. Ges. Virtsforsch. 20, 190 197 1967 and Graves et al., Res. Vet. Sci. 9, 35 40 1968 . The immunity elicited by the vaccine was challenged by placing the eight vaccinated bovine in 2 isolated rooms, four to a room and two vaccinated porcine in a separate room. In these rooms, they were exposed to 2 nonvaccinated animals. one of which was inoculated intradermalingually with 10,000 mouse L050 units of a virulent homologous strain of foot and mouth disease virus. An animal was considered protected from the disease when no sign or visible lesions of F8DV appeared after 14 days. The non vaccinated bovine inoculated with the infectious virus and normal contact control became infected and manifested signs of foot and mouth disease. The vaccinated animals did not show signs of infect ion, with the exception of one animal that showed a single foot lesion. One of the animals vaccinated with the VP3 protein purifieo from the virion did not respond with a high neutralizing antibody titer and was not protected. The two nonvaccinated control porcine became infected and were febrile. The two vaccinated porcine were free of FMDV infection. A serum sample from each animal, taken after 14 days was examined for VIA viral infection associated antigen . This served as a confirmation of the results of the challenge test. None of the animals vaccinated with the LE VP3 showed the presence of VIA antigen in their serums. All of the controls did as well as the nonprotected natural VP3 vaccinated bovine. See Table 9. Table 9 Challenge of Immunity Mouth FootCattle Antigen Lesions Lesions VIA 1 LE YP3 0 0 2 LE VP3 0 0 3 LE VP3 0 0 4 LE VP3 0 0 S LE YP3 0 6 LE VP3 C 0 7 VP3 n o 8 VP3 g None 10 None 11 Hone 12 None Swine 13 LE VP3 0 0 14 LE VP3 0 0 15 None 16 None The demonstration herein that the microbially produced Serotype A FMDV protein, namely, containing an antigenic determinant of, for example, subtype A12119ab, confers immunogenic protection to inoculated animals later exposed to the same FMDV subtype, is predictive of like protection against other strains of FHDV. In preferred embodiments, vaccines are produced by providing proteins. microbially produced as herein described, which are protective against various strains of FMDV, i.e. multi valent vaccines. For example, multi valent vaccines can be produced which protect against 038 and A23 strains, a4S and A87 strains, 075 and A380 and C22 strains, 91 and A7 strains and 64 and A178 and C91 strains. For this purpose, the respective protective proteins can be prepared separately and mixed or prepared in tandem in a single polyprotein as herein described.0. Synthetic Peptides A set of synthetic peptides have been chemically prepared based on the amino acid sequences of the various VP3 proteins. These peptides may contain one or more antigenic regions of the VP3 proteins. The peptides prepared are listed in Table 10. Studies concerning the antigenic and immunogenic properties of these peptides, of other peptides synthesized based on amino acid sequence data from other parts of the VP3 protein, as well as these peptides chemically linked to carrier proteins, should show lf these preparations induce type specific antibodies in guinea pigs or rabbits. Further studies should indicate if any virus neutralizing antibodies are induced and if such preparations can be used as vaccines to protect cattle, swine, goats, etc. from FMD infection. xrw jljjii Table 10 Synthetic Pep ti des from VP3 Protein Sequence VP3 1.
