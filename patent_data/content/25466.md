# A process for the recovery of arsenic as zinc arsenate from cement copper cake and a process for the purification of an impure zinc electrolyte using zinc arsenate so obtained.

## Abstract
A process for purifying an impure zinc electrolyte containing copper, cadmium and cobalt impurities compri sing treating the impure zinc electrolyte with zinc dust and zinc arsenate to provide a cement copper cake precipitate and a filtrate comprising a purified electrolyte solution suitable for use in electrochemical deposition processes, the zinc arsenate being obtained by recovery from the cement copper cake residues.
