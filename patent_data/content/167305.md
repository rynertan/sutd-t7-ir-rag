## Description
This invention relates to a photodetector of semiconductor material, and especially but not exclusively to an infrared photodetector. Semiconducting infrared detectors are well known, such as for example those of cadmium mercury telluride CMT . They are normally operated in an extrinsic regime in which the equilibrium majority carrier concentration greatly exceeds the intrinsic carrier concentration. To achieve this, CMT detectors sensitive in the 8 12 µm and 3 5 µm wavelength intervals are normally cooled to about 80 K and 200 K respectively. One advantage of this is that responsivity is high because a large fractional change in carrier density results from exposure to infrared radiation. Moreover, the signal to noise ratio is high because the noise due to fluctuations in the equilibrium carrier density is low. This noise benefit is particularly significant with respect to Auger generation recombination processes. In these the principal process is electron hole pair production by electron impact ionisation, the ionising electrons having thermal energy greater than the relevant semiconductor band gap. A photodetector comprising the features of the precharacterizing portion of claim 1 is known from DE A 3 015 527. The requirement to cool infrared detectors leads to considerable inconvenience and expense, particularly as regards devices requiring cooling to 80 K. It is an object of the present invention to provide an infrared detector having reduced cooling requirements as compared to the prior art. The present invention provides a photodetector having a predetermined operating temperature and including first, second and third semiconducting regions and first and second interfaces connecting the first and second regions and the second and third regions respectively, the first and third regions having sufficiently high doping to render them extrinsic at the operating temperature, wherein, the doping of the second region being such as to render it intrinsic at said predetermined operating temperature when unbiased. As has been mentioned, in order to operate infra red detectors in the extrinsic regime, it has been previously necessary to provide complex, bulky and expensive detector cooling apparatus. However, the present invention makes it possible to reduce cooling requirements significantly. The second region of a device of the invention is photosensitive. When biased, it experiences a reduction in minority carrier concentration by virtue of the adjacent second interface extracting minority carriers from it, and also by virtue of minority carriers being inhibited from reaching it by the first interface. This is equivalent to the effect achieved by cooling to reduce the intrinsic contribution to conduction, since space charge considerations require the intrinsic contribution to the majority carrier concentration to be equal to and reduced with the minority carrier concentration. The reduction in the second region minority carrier concentration produced by the invention takes place under bias. It is accordingly a dynamic effect occurring during operation, as opposed to the static effect produced by cooling. The latter produces a reduction in minority carrier concentration with or without application of device bias. The second region may have a bias contact and one or more pn junction first interfaces arranged to inhibit minority carrier flow to that region. In this case the second and third regions may be of the same semiconductor material with differing dopant species. Moreover, in this embodiment the invention may incorporate a plurality of third regions each associated with respective photosensitive second regions and second interfaces and each providing inhibiting means for its respective neighbours. The photosensitive regions preferably have a nearest neighbour separation much less than a minority carrier diffusion length. The material of the second regions may be Cd The first region may alternatively be arranged to exclude minority carriers from the region. Excluding contacts are known, as set out for example by Arthur et al., Proc. Phys. Soc. LXVIII 1 B, pp. 43 50 1954 in relation to Germanium. The characteristics of such a contact are that minority carriers are excluded from a region adjacent the contact when biased. The excluding contact may be provided by forming a degenerately doped first region in and of the same conductivity type as the second region ie. the degenerately doped first region is n or p according to whether the second region is n or p type respectively, and an n n or p p structure is formed. The excluding contact may alternatively be a heterojunction structure produced by providing the second region with a first region comprising a layer of a different and wider band gap semiconductor material of like majority carrier type ie. the structure would be In order that the invention might be more fully understood, one embodiment thereof will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Referring to Figure 1, there is shown an infra red detector diode 10 consisting of a heterostructure of cadmium mercury telluride alloys. The diode 10 has a The diode material has the alloy composition Cd In region 12, the doping level is arranged to be high enough to obtain minority carrier exclusion, ie to avoid electric fields driving minority carriers electrons from the contact 22 to the Region 12 is arranged to be sufficiently long that minority carriers electrons injected from the contact 22 fail to reach the Referring to Figure 2, there are shown diode properties depicted directly below corresponding regions of the diode 10 in Figure 1. Graphs 30 and 32 respectively illustrate the approximate variation along the diode 10 of the conduction band edge energy E The diode 10 operates as follows. As indicated in Table 1, the cutoff wavelength λ This example may be referred to as an Auger suppressed infrared diode detector, since it produces inter alia suppression of the semiconductor Auger effect previously mentioned. Whereas the embodiment of Figures 1 and 2 has been described in terms of a heterostructure diode, the Referring now to Figures 3 and 4, there are shown alternative forms of means for inhibiting minority carrier injection into a device photosensitive region. Figures 3 a and 3 b are plan and side elevations of a photodetector 50 having a p region 52 and an n region 54 of the same semiconductor material. The extracting contact is the pn junction formed at 56 intermediate regions 52 and 54. The p region 52 has a constriction 58 between two subsidiary biasable n regions 60. Subsidiary pn junctions 62 are formed between the regions 60 and region 52. The distance D from the centre of the constriction 58 to the junction 56 is substantially equal to or less than, and may preferably be very much less than, a minority carrier diffusion length L. A photosensitive region 64 is located between the constriction 58 and the extracting contact 56. Bias electrodes 66, 68 and 70 complete the device 50. A similar structure 80 is shown in Figures4 a and 4 b , respectively plan and side elevations once more. Here p and n regions 82 and 84 produce an intervening extracting pn junction contact 86, and a constriction 88 is produced by virtue of a subsidiary biasable n region 90 with associated subsidiary pn junction 92. The device 80 has a photosensitive region 94 between the constriction 88 and junction 86. Bias electrodes 96, 98 and 100 complete the device 80. The device 50 operates as follows. Electrode 66 is biased negative and electrodes 68 and 70 are biased positive. This reverse biases the extracting contact or pn junction 56, and also the subsidiary pn junction 62. Minority carrier electron injection from electrode 66 into p region 52 and so also into photosensitive region 64 is inhibited by the biased subsidiary pn junctions 62. Moreover, minority carrier extraction from photosensitive region 64 takes place by virtue of extracting contact 56. This greatly depresses the minority carrier concentration in photosensitive region 64. Similar effects occur in device 80. Referring now to Figure 5, there is shown a schematic graph 110 of minority carrier electron concentration n plotted against distance x along photodetector 50 for the p region 52. Graph 110 corresponds to the device 50 under bias. Figure 5 is shown on the same scale as and immediately below Figure 3 to facilitate comparison. The graph 110 has a value n Graph 110 reflects the situation in which D, the length of the photosensitive region 64 previously mentioned and equal to x₁ x₃, is very much less than L, the minority carrier diffusion length in region 52. This is a preferred embodiment since the minority carrier extraction effect at contact 56 is maximised. Minority carrier extraction at an extracting contact takes place over a region extending a distance substantially equal to a minority carrier diffusion length from the contact, but the effect is greatest near the contact. The length D of the photosensitive region should therefore be not significantly more than a minority carrier diffusion length L, and preferably much less. If D L, it means that the photosensitive region is not completely subject to minority carrier exclusion and its low noise benefits. As D increases beyond L, noise correspondingly increases. There is therefore no sharp change in noise properties, but instead a gradual worsening. Those skilled in the art of infrared detectors will appreciate that there is a trade off between degree of noise and photosensitive area size to be resolved in individual detector applications. Referring now to Figure 6, there is shown a plan view of a further infrared detector 120 of the invention. The detector 120 comprises a large p region 122 with a circumferential negative bias electrode 124. The region 122 is provided with a two dimensional regular array of in diffused n regions 126. The latter give rise to pn junction extracting contacts not shown and are provided with positive bias electrodes not shown . As illustrated, the array is hexagonal with an n region nearest neighbour spacing D L. The parameter D here corresponds approximately to the diameter of the respective photosensitive region extending roughly D 2 from each n region 126. The Figure 6 arrangement makes it possible to extend the minority carrier extraction effect without the limitation of diffusion length. Accordingly, photosensitive regions from which minority carriers are excluded may be extended indefinitely. In this case, all the n regions 126 would be connected together to provide a common or summed photocurrent. Alternatively, the photocurrent from each region 126 may be detected separately to provide individual pixels for a two dimensional array. These approaches may be combined so that each pixel is the sum of outputs from several individual regions 126. Parameters for CMT examples of the devices of Figures 3, 4 and 6 are as follows. The devices are made of Cd Referring now to Figure 7, there is shown a sectional view not to scale of a photodetector 140 based on the Figure 6 embodiment and arranged for ease of manufacture. The photodetector 140 has a photosensitive p region 142 with a top bias electrode structure 144 and in diffused n regions 146 providing extracting contacts. The electrode structure 144 may be either an optically transmissive network of fine line conductors or an electrically conducting transparent layer. A bottom bias electrode structure 148 provides either individual or common connection to each n region 146. This arrangement is comparatively straightforward to produce by lithographic techniques. The thickness t of the p region 142 is preferably much less than a diffusion length, as is the spacing between n regions 126. As indicated by arrow 150, the photodetector 140 is intended for top illumination. In any of the foregoing examples of the invention, it is desirable to minimise the minority carrier generation rate at any surface of the photosensitive region. Means for achieving this by surface passivation are well known in the art of CMT detectors.
