# Parking lock system for a vehicle.

## Abstract
A parking lock system for a vehicle having an automatic transmission comprises a shaft 6 bridging the case 1 of the transmission and a cover, a parking pawl 3 rotatably mounted on the shaft, a cam 7a for rotating the parking pawl 3 to engage it with a parking gear 4 secured to an output shaft 4a of the transmission, and a spring 5 for biasing the parking pawl 3 to disengage it from the parking gear 4 . A guide plate 9 is engaged with the shaft 6 at one end and with the case 1 of the transmission at the other end. The spring 5 biases the parking pawl 3 against a stop 9a formed on the guide plate 9 to hold the parking pawl 3 disengaged from the parking gear 4 when the cam 7a is retracted.
