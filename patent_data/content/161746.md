# Vented nestable pouring spout.

## Abstract
A vented, nestable extendable pouring spout for use with a container having an opening therein includes an annular mount ing portion adapted to be secured to an annular lip encompassing the opening of the container. A generally funnel shaped flexible body portion is secured at its larger circumferential edge to the mounting portion and at its smaller circumferential edge to a tubular neck portion located inwardly of the mounting portion. The body portion has an invertible fold portion adjacent the mounting portion to which is attached a plurality of circumferentially spaced ears. In the nested orientation of the spout, the ears extend downwardly out of the way of the nested neck and body portions. As the spout is extended, causing the invertible fold portion to invert, each ear rotates inwardly about its point of attachment until the ears extend inwardly perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the spout. In this orientation, the ears define a central flow aperture for the outflow of liquid and a plurality of peripheral vent openings, one between each ear, for the inflow of air.
