# SOIL RESISTANT YARNS, AQUEOUS FINISH FOR YARNS, AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCING A SOIL RESISTANT YARN

## Abstract
Soil resistant carpet yarns are provided by providing yarns coated with a soil retardant, for example, a fluoroche mical, and a retaining agent, for example, zirconium oxide. Such yarns when used in the manufacture of carpets retain their soil resistant properties during the carpet dyeing and finishing operation the zirconium oxide in some way promotes the retention of the fluorochemical on the yarn.
