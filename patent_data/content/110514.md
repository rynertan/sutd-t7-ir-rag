# Method and system for measuring a deformation.

## Abstract
A measuring system uses a magnetic scale 5 and a sensing head 6 to measure the deformation of a deform able member 2 and or one or more of physical quantities, e.g. a strain and internal stress of, or an external force to, the member 2 , which are functions of the deformation. The magnetic scale 5 is formed by a succession of discrete, uniformly spaed scaling units 5 each having a pair of mag netic poles N, S . The magnetic scale 5 is arranged to be displaceable relative to the magnetic sensing head 6 in response to a deformation of the deformable member so that the magnetic pickup head successively senses the passage of magnetic scaling units. An output circuit unit s, q, w is connected to the magnetic head 6 for counting the number of magnetic scaling units sensed and produces an electrical output signal representative thereof, and or one or more of the above physical quantities.
