# AUTOMATIC GUN FOR DISCHARGING THERMOPLASTIC RESIN

## Abstract
An automatic hot melt adhesive dispensing gun is connected by a swivel assembly to a working arm of a programmable working machine. The swivel assembly includes a hollow spindle journalled in the gun block of the gun. The free end of the spindle is connected to a hot melt adhesive source via a hose. The gun block rotates relative to the spindle. The gun can thus move in response to the movement of the working arm without exerting harmful torques on the hose.
