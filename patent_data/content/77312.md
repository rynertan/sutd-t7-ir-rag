# Trocar.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a surgical trocar comprising a band shaped, flat unit provided with an edge in its one end, and with a device for, preferably removably, attaching a tubular object in its other end. By means of the present invention a tissue penetration can be carried with a reduced risk for slippage, whereby the risk for unvolontary damages on patient and surgeon is eliminated.
