# A process for the recovery of pentavalent vanadium compounds from acid catalyst extracts.

## Abstract
A process for the preparation of pentavalent vanadium compounds by reprocessing acid extracts of vanadium containing catalysts spent in the hydrotreatment of crude or residual oils, characterized in the extracts containing triva lent and tetravalent vanadium are oxidized at a pH between 0.5 and 2.6 with an oxygen containing gas to form concen trates of tetravalent vanadium, after which oxidation is carried out at a pH between 2.6 and 4.0 with an oxygen containing gas to form concentrates of pentavalent vana dium and in that solid vanadium compounds are subse quently recovered by separating them from the liquid phase.
