# MECHANICAL ACTUATOR FOR AN INDUSTRIAL ROBOT

## Abstract
The invention provides in one aspect an arm like actuator mechanism for a robot, which mechanism compris es a baseplate 21 a pedestal 12 pivotally mounted on the baseplate for pitching movement, and means for so moving it incorporating an adjustable support prop 13 mounted to the rear of the pedestal and extending between joints 31, 26 on the pedestal and on the baseplate and a boom 14 pivotally and swivellably mounted at the free end of the pedestal for pitching and yawing movement, and means for so moving it incorporating two adjustable support struts 15a, b mounted one either side of the pedestal and each extending between joints 61, 62a, b on the boom and on the pedestal. The invention also provides a wrist like 3 axis joint arrangement 16 suitable for use in the manipulator appar atus of a robot having an arm like boom 14 , the arrange ment comprising a first, or forearm, portion 41 mountable upon the robot s boom for rotation about a first axis 150 a second, or hand, portion 42 mounted on the forearm for pivotal movement in a plane coplanar with the forearm s rotational axis and about a second axis 160 normal to and intersecting the forearm s rotational axis and a third, or tool carrier, portion 43 mounted on the hand for rotation about a third axis 170 normal to the hand s pivot axis and intersecting the forearm s rotational axis and wherein all three axes intersect at a point 151 , and the three portions are drivingly connected to drive members themselves connectable to drive means whereby each portion may individually be driven around its movement axis , the drive members comprising a combination of inner, middle and outer drive shafts all co axial with and rotatable about the forearm s rotational axis.
