## Description
WATER SWELLABLE COPOLYMERS HAVING HIGH WATER ABSORBENCY This invention relates to water absorbent resins and more particularly to water insoluble, water swellable copolymers prepared from allylic quaternary ammonium salts.PRIOR ART Water absorbent resins are widely used in the manufacture of products which require high water absorption capability. For example, water absorbent resins are used in the manufacture of surgical and dental sponges, catamenial tampons, diapers, meat trays, household pet litter, mats, etc. These resins are also used for the modification of soil to improve water retention and increase air capacity and for a host of other applications. Various natural and synthetic fibers have been used for the manufacture of water absorption materials.Natural or modified natural fibers, such as cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose have been used in the manufacture of aqueous liquid absorbing products, but these materials can only absorb relatively small amounts of water, i.e., at most 30 times the weight of the polymer. Other water absorbent resins materials, such as starch acrylonitrile graft copolymer can absorb large amounts of deionized water, such as up to 300 to 500 times their own weight, but the water absorption capacity of these resins drops considerably, i.e. to about 30 to 40 times the weight of the resin when they are used for the absorption of saline solutions. Thus, the utility of such resins is diminished considerably when they are used for the absorption of such salt containing fluids as urine and catamenial fluids. A number of polymers have been developed which have improved stability and deionized water and saline liquid absorption capacity. Thus, U.S. patent 3,669,103 discloses the preparation of water absorbing polymers of partially crosslinked polyacrylamide and poly alkali metal acrylate which are prepared by radical polymerization in an aqueous liquid of the corresponding monomer and a divinyl or diallyl cross linking compound. U.S.patent 3,670,731 discloses water absorbent articles made from crosslinked acrylamide polymers. U.S. patent 4,340, 06 teaches that polymers of acrylic acid and an alkali acrylate polymerized in an inverse suspension using specific surfactants can absorb at least 80 times their own weight of saline solution. Other U.S. patents which disclose water absorbent polymers prepared from acrylic acid, acrylamide, or alkali metal acrylate are 4,093,776, 4,286,082 and 4,342,858. The use of non crosslinked polymers of diallyl dinetbylan oniwn chloride as drainage and retention aids has also been described in the literature. For example,Chemical Abstract 98 70459d describes poly diallyldi methylamionita chloride as a pigment dispersant and retention aid, Chemical Abstract 97 180371f states that poly diallydimethylammonium chloride may be used as a flocculant in the clarification of water and ChemicalAbstract 97 143241t states that diallyldimethylammonium chloride acrylamide copolymer may be used as a drainage and retention aid in the manufacture of paper products intended for food contact.Other Chemical Abstracts which disclose the use of polymers and copolymers of diallyldimethylammonium chloride and or diallydiethylammonium chloride and acrylamide include 97 196977u, 75 108624u and 87 182734u.OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION New water insoluble, water swellable polymeric compounds have now been discovered which have high deionized water and aqueous saline solution absorptive capacity. Accordingly it is an object of the invention to present new water insoluble, water swellable polymeric materials. It is another object of the invention to present new water insoluble, water swellable polymeric materials which have very high water absorptivity. It is another object of the invention to present waterinsoluble, water swellable polymers whose water absorptive properties are not significantly diminished when used to absorb saline solutions. It is another object of the invention to present a process for preparing new waterinsoluble, water swellable polymers. It is another objective of the invention to present a process for preparing new, partially crosslinked waterswellable polymers.It is another object of the invention to present a process for preparing new water insoluble, water swellable polymers having excellent water absorbtion capability. These and other objects of the invention are supported in the following description and examples of e.bodiments of the invention. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The new polymeric compounds of the invention are partially crosslinked copolymers of at least one diallylic quaternary ammonium salt and at least one other watersoluble or water dispersible monofunctional vinyl compound.The term monofunctional vinyl compounds, as used in this description means addition polymerizable compounds which react alone or with other monofunctional vinyl compounds to form substantially linear polymers. In this sense diallyl quaternary ammonium salts are considered to be monofunctional vinyl compounds since they polymerize to form substantially linear polymers. Preferred copolymers are those prepared from diallydialkylammonium halides and one or more of acrylic or methacrylic acid or their alkali metal or ammonium salts or acrylamide. crosslinking of the polymer is accomplished by polymerizing the monomer charge in the presence of a sufficient amount of one or more polyfunctional vinyl compounds to react with the diallylic quaternary ammonium salt and or the other monfunctional vinyl compound to form a water insoluble, water swellable polymeric compound.The term wpolyfunctional vinyl compound , as used herein means addition polymerizable compounds which react alone or with monofunctional vinyl compounds to form three dimensional polymeric compounds. Accordingly, the term polyfunctional vinyl compound does not include diallyl quaternary ammonium compounds. The preferred polyfunctional vinyl compounds are the triallylalkylammonium halides the tetraallylammonium halides and divinylbenzene. The polymers of the invention are prepared by inverse suspension polymerization with an oil phase as the continuous phase and an aqueous phase as the discontinuous phase. The aqueous phase of the reaction mixture is comprised of water, the monomers, the crosslinking agent and catalyst. The continuous phase is comprised of the inert organic diluent or mixture of diluents. The two phase system may be formed in any desired order. According to one embodiment of the invention the aqueous phase of the reaction mixture is formed by combining and stirring the components sufficiently to form a uniform solution. The aqueous phase is then combined with the organic phase and the reaction suspension is established and maintained by means of agitation. The reaction vessel is purged with an inert gas, such as nitrogen, to scavenge oxygen from the reaction zone. The reactants are then heated to and maintained at the desired polymerization temperature. The reaction temperature is not critical and is determined by the particular reaction system employed. In general, reaction temperatures in the range of about 0 to 1500cm are usually used. Most often, a reaction temperature of about 30 to l000C is preferred. During the reaction the reaction mixture is agitated sufficiently to maintain a stable suspension and to remove excess heat.When the desired degree of conversion is attained the reaction is terminated by cooling the reaction mixture and recovering the product from the polymerization medium. One method of product recovery consists of removing the water from the reaction mixture, as by distillation, and separating the polymeric product from the inert diluent by filtration, decantation, centrifugation, etc. The polymer may be washed in an inert organic liquid to remove impurities such as suspending agents. The foregoing sequence of steps is exemplary only and is not intended to be limiting. Equivalent techniques for carrying out the reaction and recovering the product may be employed. Furthermore, if desired, the organic phase may be recovered and reused. The polymeric product is obtained in the form of fine solid beads. me product can be used as is, pulverized, molded or otherwise formed into various products, depending upon the intended end use of the product. Typical product forms include film, powder, fiber, fabric, particulates, etc. The product can be combined with other materials, such as cotton, wood pulp, etc. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The diallylic quaternary ammonium compounds useable in the invention are any diallylic ammonium compounds which form environmentally acceptable waterswellable polymers. Suitable diallylic ammonium compounds are those having the structural formulaEMI6.1 wherein R and R are organic radicals which are free of substituents which would unduly interfere with the formation of environmentally acceptable water swellable polymers and X is an environmentally acceptable anion.Thus R and R may be hydrocarbon radicals, such as saturated aliphatic and cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon radicals, aromatic hydrocarbon radicals and substituted hydrocarbon radicals, such as carboxylates, ethers, alcohols, esters, etc. R and R may be the same or different radicals. R and R may also be joined together to form a nitrogen containing ring compound. As indicated above, the only restrictions on R and R is that they do not, to an unacceptable degree, adversely interfere with the ability of the monomer to form the desired polymeric product, that they do not prevent the polymeric product from performing in the intended manner and that they do not result in the formation of environmentally unacceptable products. Thus, subject to these restrictions, R and R may have any number of carbon atoms or be any substituents.In a preferred embodiment of the inventionR and R are saturated aliphatic or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons having 1 to 20 and more preferably 1 to 6 carbon atoms. The radical X in the above formula may represent an anion which likewise must not, to an unacceptable extent, interfere with the ability of the monomer to form the desired product, interfere with the desired performance of the desired product or result in the formation of environmentally unacceptable products. X may be an inorganic anion, such as halide, nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, etc. ion, or an organic anion, such as acetate, propionate, etc. radical. In the preferred embodiment X is a halide ion. Preferred halide ions are the chloride and bromide ions. Typical of compounds falling within the scope of the above description are aliphatic and aromatic diallyldihydrocarbylammonium salts, such as diallyldi methylasitonium chloride, diallyldimethylammonium bromide, diallyldiethylammonium chloride, diallylethylmethyl ammonium chloride, diallyldidecylammonium bromide, diallyd ibenzylammonium chloride, diallylbenzylmethyl ammonium bromide, diallyldimethylammonium nitrate, diallyldiethylammonium acetate, etc and diallyldi organoamonium salts containing hetero atoms, such as N,N diallyl N,N diethoxymethylammonium chloride, N,N diallyl N,N dicarboxypropylammonium chloride, etc.Preferred diallylammonium salts are the diallyldi hydrocarby amxonium halides, particularly the diallyldialkyl ammonium salts of chlorine and bromine, such as diallyldisethylammonium chloride, diallyldimethylammonium bromide, diallyldiethylammonium chloride, diallylethyl methylaxaoniuia chloride, etc. The other water dispersible monofunctional vinyl compounds which are suitable for use in preparing the invention are vinyl compounds which are copolymerizable with the diallylic quaternary ammonium compounds. The following groups of vinyl compounds are typical of the most common useful vinyl compounds, but this list is not intended to be all inclusive, i.e. vinyl compounds other than those listed below may be used in the preparation of the compounds of the invention Acrylic type acids and their alkali metal or ammonium salts, such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, sodium acrylate, potassium acrylate, ammonium acrylate, sodium methacrylate, etc. Other unsaturated organic acids or anhydrides and their salts, such as maleic acid, fumaric acid, itaconic acid, maleic anhydride, mono or di sodium maleate, potassium fumarate, ammonium itaconate, etc., Acrylic and methacrylic partial and full esters such as the lower alkyl esters, hydroxyesters and acid esters of acrylic and methacrylic acids, i.e. those containing 1 to 6 and preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms in each ester moiety, including methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, methyl ethacrylate, hydroxyethyl acrylate, hydroxypropyl acrylate, acrylic acid dimer, etc. Aminoalkylacrylates containing up to 4 carbons in each alkyl or alkylene group such as dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate, diethylaminoethyl acrylate, etc Unsubstituted and alkyl substituted acrylamides and methacrylamides containing up to 4 alkyl carbon atoms such as acrylamide, methacrylamide, dimethylacrylamide, ethylmethylacrylamide, methylmethacrylamide, etc. Aminoalkylacrylamides containing 1 to 4 alkyl or alkylene carbon atoms, such as dimethylaminopropylmethacrylamide, methacrylamidopropyltrimethylammonium chloride, etc Acrylamidoalkylsulfonic acids and their salts containing 1 to 4 alkyl carbon atoms, such as acrylamido methylpropyisulfonic acid, sodium acrylamidomethylethylsulfonate, etc Water dispersible substituted styrenes, such as styrene sulfonic acid, trimethylSvinylbenzene ammonium chloride1 etc and Other water dispersible vinyl compounds, such as vinyl esters and vinyl lactams, including vinyl pyrrolidone, vinyl acetate, etc. One or more than one other monofunctional vinyl compound may be used in the invention. The relative amounts of diallylic quaternary ammonium salt and the other monofunctional vinyl monomer is not critical. In general, the minimum amount of diallylic quaternary ammonium salt incorporated into the copolymer is usually about 5 mole percent. There is no maximum amount of diallylic monomer, the only limitation being that the product is a copolymer of the diallylic monomer and the other monofunctional vinyl monomer. The preferred and most preferred molar ratios of diallylic quaternary ammonium salt to other monofunctional vinyl compound incorporated into the copolymers are 95 5 to 5 95 and 9Q 1û to 10 90, respectively. The crosslinking component may be any polyfunctional ethylenically unsaturated compound which is free of functional groups which would interfere with the ability of the diallylic quaternary ammonium salt and other monofunctional vinyl monomer to form water swellable polymeric products. It is desirable to use crosslinking agents which form environmentally acceptable products.Typical of such crosslinking agents are triand tetra allylammonium halides, such as triallylmethylammonium chloride, triallylethylammonium bromide, tetra allylammonium chloride, tetra allylammonium bromide, etc polyfunctional acrylamides, such as methylene bisacrylamide, etc. polyfunctional acrylic type compounds, such as ethylene glycol diacrylate, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate, allyl acrylate, etc and other polyallyl and polyvinyl compounds, such as diallyl phthdlate, diallyl maleate, divinylbenzene, etc. The amount of polyfunctional vinyl compound used is that amount which will effect the desired degree of crosslinking of the polymeric product i.e. an amount which will result in the production of the desired waterinsoluble, water swellable polymeric compound. Thus, any amount of polyfunctional vinyl compound varying from the least amount which is effective to produce products having useful water absorbing properties up to about 20 mole percent may be present in the reaction mixture. Usually, however, the amount of polyfunctional vinyl compound used in the preparation of the products of the invention varies from about 0.005 to about 20 mole percent and preferably about 0.05 to 10 mole percent, based on the total amount of monofuntional and polyfunctional vinyl compound present in the reaction mixture. The polymerization is carried out in the presence of a free radical generating catalyst.Conventional free radical catalysts, such as organic peroxides, inorganic persulfates and azo compounds, produce satisfactory results in the preparation of the polymeric product. Representative organic peroxides include benzoyl peroxide, t butyl hydroperoxide, t butyl peroctoate, cumene hydroperoxide, t butyl peroxide, etc.Representative persulfates include potassium persulfate, ammonium persulfate, etc. Representative azo compounds include azobisisobutyronitnle, etc. Redox radical generators may also be used to catalyze the polymerization. For example, persulfates can be combined with reducing substances such as sulfites or amines to form free radical generating initiators. Examples of redox systems include ammonium persulfate with sodium bisulfite, t butylhydroperoxide with ferrous ammonium sulfate, etc.The particular catalyst used will, of course, depend upon the polymerization temperature employed and the particular monomers and organic diluents used in the polymerization process. The amount of catalyst used in the reaction of the invention is generally in the range of about 0.001 to 5 percent and preferably in the range of about 0.01 to 1 percent, based on the total weight of monomer present in the reaction zone. As noted above, water or a liquid in which the monomer charge is soluble constitutes the discontinuous phase and an inert organic diluent, i.e. a liquid in which the monomer and polymer product are insoluble and which will not adversely interfere with the desired polymerization reaction, constitutes the continuous phase. Typical of the inert organic liquids that can be used as the continuous phase are saturated aliphatic or cylcloaliphatic hydrocarbons such as pentane, hexane, heptane, ligroin, cyclopentane, . cyclohexane, methyl cyclopentane, etc. aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, etc. ketones, such as acetone, methylethylketone, etc. Preferred organic diluents are the saturated aliphatic and cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons such as hexane, heptane and cyclohexane. Mixtures of two or more of the above organic liquids can be used, if desired. The ratio of continuous phase to discontinuous phase is not critical. The amount of continuous phase in the reaction vessel is desirably great enough to permit the heat developed as a result of the polymerization reaction to be easily dissipated and to maintain the monomer and polymer in the suspended state. The ratio of continuous phase to aqueous phase maintained during the reaction is often about 9 1 to 2 3 and usually about 3 1 to 1 1, on a volume basis. The concentration of total monomers to aqueous phase is not critical. The optimum concentration will depend upon the entire system. In general the monomer constitutes about 30 to 75 and more often 40 to 65 by weight of the total aqueous phase. It is sometimes found advantageous, however, to use a system in which the discontinuous phase is made up substantially of the monomers. It is usually preferred to use a suspending agent to maintain the reactants in a stable suspension.Any of the well known suspending agents used for inverse suspension polymerizations can be used in the invention. Examples of suitable suspending agents include the polymeric suspending agents, such as starch, gelatin, cellulose derivatives, polyvinyl alcohol, etc. A particularly preferred suspending agent is vinyl pyrrolidone alpha oleo in copolymer. Other additives, such as stabilizers, fillers, molecular weight regulators, etc., may be used in the polymerization. Examples of stabilizers and fillers include talc, hydrophobic silica, calcium carbonate, tricalcium phosphate, hydroxy apatite, Fullers earth, bentonite, etc. The stabilisers are generally used at concentrations of about .01 to 10 and usually about 0.1 to about 5 , based on the total weight of the reaction mixture. The following example illustrates a specific embodiment of the invention. Unless otherwise indicated parts and percentages are on a weight basis. In the example the swelling index is obtained as follows A weighed sample of test polymer is immersed and allowed to remain in an aqueous liquid for one hour. The swollen sample is removed with a screen and permitted to drain in air until all excess water is removed. The sample is then reweighed.The swelling index is obtained from the following equation EMI14.1 tb SEP wet SEP sample SEP weight tb swelling SEP index SEP SEP dry SEP sample SEP weight tb EXAMPLE To 70.8 g of a 68.3 aqueous solution of diallyldimethylammonium chloride were added 21.6 g of acrylic acid, 23.76 g of 50 sodium hydroxide, 0.56 g of a 57.78 solution of triallylmethylammonium chloride, 23.25 g of water, 0.269 g tetrasodium ethylenediaminetetracetate and 0.1287 g of ammonium persulfate. The solution was added to 260 ml of heptane containing 0.1 g of a vinyl pyrrolidone alpha olefin copolymer sold byGAF Corporation under the trademark Ganex V220 and 3.0 g of hydrophobic silica.The mixture was agitated in a high speed mixer for 5 minutes, then added to a glass reactor equipped with an agitator and heating mantle.The system was purged with nitrogen for one hour, then heated to and maintained at 65 700C for 3 hours with continuous stirring. The suspension was heated to reflux to remove the water and then cooled. On cooling the product was collected by filtration. The product had a swelling index of 44 in deionized water and 31 in 0.9 saline solution. The above example illustrates the benefit of the invention. The fact that the polymer had a swelling index of 44 in deionized water and 31 in 0.9 saline solution shows that the polymer is relatively insensitive to saline solution. Thus it can be reliably used to absorb either salt free or saline solutions. Although the invention has been described with particular reference to a specific example, it is understood that the invention includes variations of the example. For example, the polymer may be made from three or more monomers. The invention is limited only by the scope of the appended claims.
