# Apparatus for determining the presence of combustible constituents in a mixture.

## Abstract
In a zirconia oxygen sensing apparatus, gas flows through inner 14 and outer tubes 12 , one electrodes 18 is attached to the inner surface of the inner tube 14 and another electrode 16 is attached to the outer surface of the inner tube 14 . The inner tube 14 is catalytic and the outer catalytic surface therefore is made inert so that an oxygen potential difference is produced between the electrodes 16, 18 which results in a voltage output, as read by an oxygen analyzer 42 , which is proportional to the initial level of the combustible in the gas. The utilisation of inner 14 and outer 12 tubes wherein the portion of the gas sample contacting the active electrode 18 is maintained separate from the portion of the gas sample contacting the inactive electrode 16 prevents back or edge diffusion between the electrodes.

## Description
APPARATUS FOR DETERMINING THE PRESENCE OF COMBUSTIBLE CONSTITUENTS IN A MIXTURE The present invention relates to apparatus for determining the presence of predetermined combustible constituents in a mixture that contains oxygen. Prior art devices for determining the presence of carbon monoxide and other combustibles utilise techniques such as infrared adsorption, chemiluminescence, surface adsorption cells and the like. While such methods are capable of determining the required levels of carbon monoxide and other combustibles, they tend to be expensive, can be susceptible to long term drift, and can be difficult to calibrate. One known type of combustibles sensor, disclosed in U S Patent No. 4 005 001, supplies a gaseous mixture of oxygen and fuel to first and second electrodes on opposite surfaces of an oxygen ion conductive solid electrolyte cell in the form of a disc having the electrodes on opposite surfaces thereof.The electrodes are composed of different materials each exhibiting a different catalytic action on the gaseous mixture at a given temperature.The difference in oxygen potentials established at the respective electrodes as a result of the dissimilar catalytic action produces oxygen ion conductivity in the solid electrolyte cell which produces an electrical signal having a magnitude which is indicative of the combustible present in the mixture. It has been found that with this disc type of electrolyte, concentration gradients with very low flow rates will force diffusion of the reacted and unreacted gas to opposite electrode surfaces which can cause confusing results. Because of the foregoing, it has now become desirable to develop a combustibles sensor having improved flow sensitivity and reproducibility. According to the present invention there is provided apparatus for determining the presence of predetermined combustible constituents in an excess oxygen gas mixture, the apparatus comprising an oxygen ion conductive solid electrolyte cell including first and second electrodes disposed on opposite surfaces thereof, and means for conducting a sample of the gas mixture simultaneously to the first and second electrodes, wherein the first electrode is such as to support a first rate of catalytic combustion reactivity between the oxygen and combustible constituents of the gas mixture and the second electrode is such as to support a second rate of catalytic combustion reactivity between the oxygen and combustible constituents of the gas mixture, the first rate is different from the second rate so as to produce an oxygen potential difference beween the first and second electrodes, and the solid electrolyte cell is operative to develop an output signal corresponding to the oxygen potential difference and indicative of the combustible constituents present in the gas mixture, characterised in that the solid electrolyte cell comprises a tube, the first electrode is attached to the outside surface of the tube, and the second electrode is attached to the inside surface of the tube. A preferred embodiment of the present invention described hereinbelow is intended to solve or at least alleviate the aforementioned problems associated with the prior art by providing a combustibles sensor which has improved flow sensitivity and reproducibility. More specifically, the preferred embodiment comprises a modified zirconia oxygen sensor wherein gas flows through inner and outer tubes, and wherein one electrode is on the inner surface of the inner tube and the second electrode is on the outer surface of hte inner tube. An outer catalytic surface of the inner tube is made inert by means of a cement or other material which poisons its catalytic activity. Because of the tubular configuration, sample gas flow is split, so that gas flow exists on both sides of the inner tube, and there is no mixing of the reacted and unreacted gas.When no combustibles are present, the sensor output is near zero because there is equal oxygen concentration on both sides of the sensor. When operating at sufficient temperature to produce catalytic activity between the combustible gas and oxygen on the inside of the sensor, there is a resulting decrease of oxygen in the inner sample because oxygen is consumed in the reactiqn. For example, where CO is the combustible to be detected EMI2.1 The 2 differential between the inner and outer surfaces of the inner tube will produce a voltage proportional to the initial level of CO in the gas mixture. By virtue of the tubular construction, once the rEaction occurs at the active inner electrode the gas is physically constrained to remain separated from the outer surface of the inner tube.Accordingly, back diffusion or edge diffusion is essentially eliminated. The invention will now be further described, by way of illustrative and non limiting example, with reference to the accompanying drawing, in which Figure 1 is a schematic representation of apparatus embodying the present invention and Figure 2 is a graphical representation of sensor voltage output for various concentrations of oxygen in a carbon monoxide and oxygen mixture. Figure 1 is a schematic representation of apparatus embodying the present invention and illustrates a combustibles sensor assembly iO comprising an outer tube 12, an oxygen ion conductive solid electrolyte cell in the form of an inner tube 14, a first annular electrode 16 adhered to the outer diameter of the inner tube 14, and a second annular electrode 18 adhered to the inner diameter of the inner tube 14. In this preferred embodiment of the present invention, the electrodes 16 and 18 are electrically connected to a zirconia oxygen analyzer 42 of the type disclosed in U S Patent No. 3 960 500. The outer tube 12 receives a sample of gas from a furnace stack O through a plurality of holes 22 formed in the side of the stack, while . e inner tube 14 receives the sample through a central opening 24 formed in the stack, the gas sample then flowing through the tubes and being exhausted to an exhaust plenum 26 via holes 28 and 30 formed in the plenum. The inner tube 14 is formed of a zirconia material, and the outer surface thereof is made inert by coating it with a cement or other material which poisons its catalytic activity. The electrodes 16 and 18 can be formed from platinum or some other noble metal. A heating coil 32 surrounds the outer tube 12 and is operatively connected to a temperature controller 34 which effectively regulates the temperature of the sensor assembly 10 to a desired operating temperature, typically between 4000C and 10000, as monitored by a thermocouple unit 35.Electrical leads 38 and 40 connect the electrodes 16 and 18 to the oxygen analyzer 42. By making the outer electrode 16 inert, the oxygen analyzer 42, as disclosed in U S Patent No. 3 960 500 previously noted, is converted into a combustibles sensor. Using the measurement of CO as an example, the 2 differential between the inner and outer surfaces of the tube 14 produces a voltage output, as recorded by the oxygen analyzer 42, which is proportional to the initial level of CO in the gas mixture. By using the configuration illustrated, wherein the gas sample is split and flows both inside and outside the zirconia cell defined by the inner tube 14, the gas which contacts the active inner electrode 18 is always maintained separate from the gas which contacts the inactive outer electrode 16, so that the back or edge diffusion present in prior art devices is essentially eliminated. An example of the use of the zirconia oxygen analyzer 42 as part of the apparatus embodying the present invention is illustrated in Figure 2, in which the voltage output as determined by the oxygen analyzer 42 is plotted versus parts per million of CO in actual gas mixtures with various oxygen concentrations. While Figure 2 illustrates the sensing of carbon monoxide, it can be appreciated that the system can also be calibrated to sense other combustibles in fuel mixtures containing oxygen.
