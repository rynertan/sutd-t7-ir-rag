# Process for preparation of ultrapure thorium fluoride.

## Abstract
The specification discloses a process for the preparation of ultrapure thorium fluoride ThF₄ having minimized water content and consequent maximized optical transmission of 10.6 micrometer radiation. First, thorium oxide is reacted with aqueous hydrofluoric acid to form a solid reaction product, which is then dried under controlled heating to form a hydrated thorium fluoride with a predetermined amount of hydration, namely ThF₄ xH₂O where x is equal to 0.39. The hydrated thorium fluoride is exposed to a reactive atmos phere of hydrofluoric acid vapor and a selected fluoride compound in the gase phase at elevated temperature for a predetermined period of time. The reactive atmosphere removes substantially all of the water and water derived impurities from the hydrated thorium fluoride to produce ultrapure thorium fluoride which is highly transmissive to 10.6 micrometer radiation.
