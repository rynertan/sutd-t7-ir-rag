# Buried servo track data recording systems.

## Abstract
An improved data recording system operating with a buried servo track carried by the recording medium 10 has the common read write gap 14 of the transducer 13 in the transducer track position controlling servo loop 40, 41, 20, 37, 41, 42, 43, 22 for both reading and writing data. During writing, the data input, adjusted and inverted, is also applied to the servo loop together with intended position control signals via lines 34 and 35.
