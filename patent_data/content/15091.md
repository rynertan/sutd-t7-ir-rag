# Switching amplifier for driving a load through an alternating current path.

## Abstract
An amplifier includes first 42 and second 44 switches coupled at a juncture 46 to form a series circuit. The series circuit is serially coupled with an inductor 48 across a source of energizing potential BL . A capacitor 54 couples the juncture 46 between the switches to a switch arrangement 62 The switches conduct alternately under the control of a duty cycle modulator. The duty cycle modulation tends to vary the amplitude of the two opposite polarity portions of the signal appearing at the control electrode of the switch arrangement 62 . A clamp 50 is coupled to the junction of the series switch circuit and the inductor 48 . The clamp 50 operates during a first of the two alternate switch conduction intervals to clamp the voltage across the inductor 48 at a fixed value. Since a direct voltage cannot be established across an inductor, the voltage across the inductor during the second switch conduction interval is established by the clamp voltage and the duty cycle, and varies with duty cycle. The amplitude of the signal at the juncture of the two switches 42 and 44 varies with duty cycle variations in such a manner as to maintain the signal of one polarity at the control electrode of the switch arrangement 62 at a constant amplitude. This also reduces errors arising from unwanted variations in the turn off time of the duty cycling switches 42,44 .
