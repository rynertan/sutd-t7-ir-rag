# Signal copy device for digital record reproduction system.

## Abstract
A signal copy device for a digital record reproduction system includes an encoding circuit 12 for producing a first digital encoded signal corresponding to an analog audio signal. The encoding circuit 12 is connected to a first VTR 24 through a switch section 16 of a switch circuit 18 and a first digital signal processor 22 . A second VTR 64 reproduces and generates a digital encoded audio signal to be copied. The switch circuit 18 is connected to the encoding circuit 12 and the second VTR 64 . The switch circuit 18 includes two switch sections 16, 28 which operate in cooperation with each other. When a reproduction signal is generated from the second VTR 64 , the two switch sections 16, 28 are switched. The reproduction signal is supplied to the first VTR 24 through these switch sections 16, 28 , thus accomplishing copying.
