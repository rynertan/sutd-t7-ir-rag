# Hollow sphere ceramic particles for abradable coatings.

## Abstract
A hollow sphere ceramic flame spray powder is dis closed. The desired constituents are first formed into agglomerated particles in a spray drier. Then the agglomer ated particles are introduced into a plasma flame which is adjusted so that the particles collected are substantially hollow. The hollow sphere ceramic particles are suitable for flame spraying a porous and abradable coating.
