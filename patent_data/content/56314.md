## Description
TITLEN Haloalkyl Thiobenzanilides, Production Thereof,Compositions Contai niflq Them and Their use as Fungicides This invention relates to certain novel N haloalkyl thiobenzanilides, to the production thereof, to compositions containing them and to their use as fungicides. The present invention provides as new compounds having fungicidal activity, compounds of the general formula EMI1.1 in which R is hydrogen, C1 C5 alkyl, preferably C1 C3 alkyl,C1 C3 haloalkyl, preferably CF3, halogen including F, Cl, Br, and I, NO2, C1 to C2 alkoxy, R1 is H or C N, and X and Y are either C1 or F but not identical when R1 is H and, X and Y are C1 when R1 is C9N. Although the compounds of the invention are generally active as fungicides, it has been discovered that they are also effective as systemic toxicants and this ancillary feature greatly increases their usefulness and versatility in treating fungus infected food crops. As those skilled in the art are aware, a systemic biocide is taken up internally by the organism to which it is applied and lodges in the tissues while still retaining toxicological properties.When used to protect food crops systemic toxicants are not subject to weathering since they are confined within the interstices of the plan tissues which are thereby internally immunized against the attack of harmful fungi, blights and similar pesticidal microorganlsms. The compounds of the present invention are prepared by the following general reaction.Reaction No. 1EMI1.2 Generally a mclar amount of the substituted benzoyl chloride reactant, dissolved in benzene, is added to a mixture of the are reactant and a slight molar excess of an XC1 acceptor such as trierhyl mir.e. The mixture is refluxed for 1 2 hour and then cooled. The solid reaction product is diluted with a solvent such as ethyl acetate or chloroform and washed with water twice ard salt solution once. The fungi product is dried over MgSO4, filtered and evaporated.Reaction No. 2EMI2.1 Under a dry nitrogen atmosphere a molar amount of the reaction product from Reaction No. 1 is dissolved in dry tetrahydrofuran THF .Next, a slight molar excess of NaR is added with stirring.

Evaluation for Preventive Action 1. Bean Rust Test Pinto bean plants Phaseolus vulgaris L. approximately 10 centimeters cm. tall are transplanted into sandy loam soil in three inch clay pots.The plants are then inverted and dipped for two to three seconds in 50 50 acetone water solution of the test cca1. Test concentrations range from 1000 ppm downward. After the leaves are dried they are inoculated with a water suspension of spores of the bean rust fungus Urumyces phaseoli Arthur and the plants are placed in an environment of 100 humidity for 24 hours. The plants are then removed from the humidity chamber and held until disease pustules appear on the leaves. Effectiveness is recorded as the lowest concentra tion, in ppm, which will provide 75 or greater reduction in pustule formation as compared to untreated, inoculated plants. These values are recorded in Table II. 2. Bean Powdery Mildew Test A candidate chemical is prepared and applied in the same manner as for the bean rust test. After the plants are dry, the leaves are dusted with spores of the powder mildew furtis Erysiphe polygon De Candolle and the plants are retained in the greenhouse until the fungal growth appears on the leaf surface.Effectiveness is recorded as the lowest concentration, in ppr, which will provide 75p or greater reduction in irycelial formation as compared to untreated, incoulated plants. These values are recorded in Table II. 3. Tomato Early Blight A candidate compound is dissolved in an appropriate solvent and diluted with a 50 50 acetone water solution.Four week old tomato Lycocersicon esculentum plants are then sprayed with the solution to the point of runoff. Test concentrations range from 1000 ppm downward. When the leaves are dry, they are inoculated with a water suspens on of spores of the early blight fungus Alternaria solar Ellis and rtin and placed in an environment of 100 humidity for 48 hours. The plants are then removed from the humidity chamber and held until disease lesions appear on the leaves. Effectiveness is recorded as the lowest concentration, in ppm, which will provide 75 or greater reduction in the number of lesions formed as compared to untreated, inoculated plants.These values are recorded in Table I1. 4. Blue Grass Leaf Spot A candidate chemical is prepared and applied in the same manner as the tomato early blight test except that four week old Kentucky Bluegrass Poa pratensis plants are utilized 2s the host plant. When the leaves are dry, they are inoculated with a water suspension of spores of the blue grass leaf spot fungus Helminthosporium sativum and placed in an environment of 100 humidity for 48 hours. The plants are then removed from the humidity chamber and held until disease lesions appear on the leaves. Effectiveness is recorded as the lowest concentration, in ppm, which will provide 75 or greater reduction in number of lesions formed as compared to untreated, inoculated plants. These values are recorded in Table II. Evaluation for Eradicant Action 1. Bean Rust Test Untreated bean plants Fhaseolus vulganis . are incoluated with spores of the bean rust fungus Uromyces phaseoli Ar hur and placed in an environment with 100 humidity for 24 hours.The plants are then removed fran the humidity chamber and held in the greenhouse for two days to allow the disease to become established. A candidate chemical is then prepared and applied in the same manner as in the bean rust test in Evaluation for Preventive Action . Eradicative effectiveness is recorded as the lowest concentration, in ppm, which will provide a 75 or greater reduction in number of pustules appearing on the leaves as compared to untreated inoculated plants. These values are recorded in Table II. 2. Eean Powdery Mildew Test Untreated pinto bean plants are dusted with spores of the powdery mildew fugus Erysiphe polygon re Car,dolle and maintained in the greenhouse until mycelial growth appears in the leaf surface. A candidate chemical is then prepared and applied in the same manr.er as for the bean rust test. Four days later the leaves are examined for inhibition of further mycelial growth. Eradicative effectiveness is recorded as the lowest concentration, in pan, which will provide a 75 or greater inhibition of viable, sporulating mycelium as compared to untreated inoculated plants. These values are recorded inTable II.

The compounds of this invention are generally embodied into a form suitable for convenient application. For ex ple, the compound can be embodied into a pesticidal composftion which is provided in the form. of emulsions, suspensions, sclutions, dusts and aerosol sprays. Tr, general, such corsositions will contain, in addition to the active compound, the adjuvants which are found noramily in pesticide preparations In these compositions the active compound of this invention can be employed as the sole pesticide component or it can be used in admixture with other compounds having similar uility.The pesticide compositions of this invention can contain, as adjutants, organic solvents, such as sesame oil, xylene range solvents heavy petroleum, etc. water emulsifying agents surface active agents talc pyrophylllte diatomite gypsum clays, propellants, such as dichlorodifluoromethanne, etc. It desired, however, the active compound can be applied directly to feedstuffs, seeds, etc., upon which the pests feed. When applied in such a manner, it will be acvsntageous to use 2 compound which is not volatile.In connection with the activity of the presently disclosed pesticidal compound, it should be fully understood that it is not necessary that they be active as such. The purposes of this invention will be fully served if the compound is rendered active by external influences, such as light or by scme physiological action which occurs when the compound is ingested into the body of the pest. The precise manner in which the pesticidal compositions of h s invention are used in any particular instance will be readily apparent to a person skilled in the art. Generally, the active pesticide compund will be embodied in the form of a liquid composition for example, an emulsion, suspension, or aerosol spray. While the concentration of the active pesticide in the present compositions can vary within rather wide limits, ordinarily the pesticide compund will comprise not more than about 15.0,Wo by weight of the composition. Preferably, however, the pesticide compositions of this invention will be in the form of solutions or suspensions containing about 0.1 to 1.0 by weight of the active pesticide compound.
