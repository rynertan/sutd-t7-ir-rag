## Description
Statine 4S amino, 3S hydroxy, 6 methylheptanoic acid is of pharmaceutical interest as a key inter mediate in the preparation of inhibitors of proteases such as pepsin and renin. It is disclosed as compound No. 8652 at page 1258 of It has been demonstrated that pepsin inhibitors containing the unnatural 3R, 4S isomer of statine ex hibit as much as a thousand fold decrease in activity when compared to their counterparts prepared from the naturally occuring 3S, 4S isomer. See Liu, W. Smith, S. Glover, G. wherein R is C O OC CH₃ ₃. Initially, 3S, 4S statine was obtained by the puri fication of the hydrolysates of a number of pepstatins or pyridomycin, which yielded the natural isomer. How ever, the scale of these preparative procedures has been increased to only a modest level. Chiral and diastereomeric statines can be made by a variety of techniques. The chiral methods suffer from various disadvantages. Often, they are multi step procedures having moderate to poor yields, requiring exotic reagents, which in most cases do not yield a sufficiently high enantiomeric excess or purity to avoid a purification step to remove the unwanted isomer or other contaminants. The diastereomeric procedures, while being synthetically efficient, share with the Chiral procedures the necessity for a purification step to remove the unwanted isomer. Previously, such purification was accomplished by chromatographic methods which are not trivial, in that the Rf values of protected statine isomers are very similar. The selection of various derivatives of, or protecting groups, for the desired product s can increase or decrease the difficulty of this separation. See U.S. patent 4,397,786 Rich, D. Son, E.

The separation of isomers of Boc statine by fractional crystallization has only been cited twice in prior literature. In one reference, the separation of 3S, 4S Boc statine from the 3RS, 4S Boc statine mixture was set out. However, it was later determined by another investigator that the product was still a mixture of isomers. That investigator obtained the pure isomers by chromatography. See the Rich et.al. article cited above and Steulmann, R. Klostermeyer, H. Liebigs Ann. Chem., 2245 2250 1975, CA 84 106020f. The invention deals with a novel method for sepa rating a mixture of 3S and 3R Boc statine. It is based on the discovery of an amine which can be used to form the salts of a mixture of 3S and 3R Boc statine, which salts can be separated by fractional crystallization to yield the desired 3S, 4S isomer. In a preferred embodiment, four crystallizations or less are needed to separate a 55 45 mixture of 3RS, 4S Boc statine as the R alpha phenethylamine salt to a purity of 97 in the desired 3S isomer. The isomer can be further purified by regeneration to free the Boc statine acid, which can be crystallized to 100 purity based on HPLC analysis. Overall yield is approximately 70 of the available 3S isomer. Alpha phenethylamine, also known as methyl benzylamine conforms to the formula Other aspects and advantages will be apparent upon consideration of the following description of the invention. The invention deals with a process for the separa tion of 3S, 4S Boc statine from the unwanted 3R, 4S Boc statine formed when the process of US 4,397,786 is carried out. A typical scheme for the production of the R alpha phenethylamine salt of 3S, 4S Boc statine and the subsequent regeneration of 3S, 4S Boc statine is described below. t Boc leucinaldehyde was prepared from the O,N dimethyl amide in a similar manner to that described by Rague, B. et.al. Crude 3RS, 4S Boc statine ethyl ester is prepared from this aldehyde and was hydrolysed to 3RS, 4S Boc statine as described in U.S. patent 4,397,786. These procedures are described as follows A solution was prepared from the addition of Boc Leucine H₂O Bachem, 200 g, 0.8 moles to two liters of 80 20 MeCl₂ THF. The solution was dried over MgSO₄, filtered, and added to a 5 L flask equipped with argon purge and mechanical stirring. The solution was cooled to 18 C and carbonyldiimadazole AIdrich, 136.7 g, 0.842 moles was added, with offgassing. The mixture was stirred for one hour at 15 C and O,N dimethyl hydroxylamine hydrochloride Aldrich, 87.4 g, 0.896 moles was charged, followed by the addition of N methylpiperidine AIdrich, 83.96 g, 0.864 moles, 103 ml . Exotherm to 10 C was observed. The mixture was stirred, and allowed to warm to room temperature overnight. The mixture was stripped to an oil, taken up into 1.5 L ethyl acetate and extracted three times with 1 L of 1 Boc Leucine O,N dimethylamide 180.9 g, 0.66 moles and 800 ml dry THF were charged to a 5 L flask giving solution. The mixture was cooled to 20 C. Over 15 minutes, a suspension of LiAlH₄ Ventron, 26.24 g, 0.69 moles, 5 excess in 500 ml THF was charged from a cooled addition funnel, giving vigorous offgassing. The mixture was stirred and allowed to warm to 5 C over 15 minutes. 3 Material should be stored at _30 C and used as soon as possible to avoid racemization. To a 3 L flask containing THF 350 ml was charged diisopropylamine 145.2 ml, 112.09 g, 1.11 moles . The mixture was cooled to 35 C and N butyllithium, 2.4 Boc Statine Ethyl Ester 222.9 g, 0.755 moles was charged to a 5 L flask containing 1 L dioxane, giving solution. 1 L H₂O was added, giving a cloudy suspension. A pH meter was standardized at pH 10 using 50 50 dioxane pH 10 buffer. The meter was used to monitor the addition of 50 NaOH to the mixture over 45 minutes, at a rate that maintained pH at 12.0. After pH had stabilized at 12.0, the mixture was stirred an additional 45 minutes at 25 C. pH was then adjusted to 6.5 with 12 HCl and the dioxane was removed in vacuo, reducing the total volume by approximately one half. The mixture was extracted three times with 1000 ml ethyl acetate to remove impurities. The aqueous phase was cooled to 3 C and acidified to pH 2 with 12 HCl. This was extracted twice with 1.5 L ethyl acetate, which was washed with 100 ml saturated NaCl solution, dried over MgSO₄, filtered and stripped to a solid, 160.8 g, 77 yield. 3RS, 4S Boc statine 173.38 g, 0.63 mol. prepared as described above, was dissolved in 11.67 L hot ethyl acetate to which was added 170 ml methanol. To this was added R alpha phenethylamine 76.34 g, 0.63 m from Norse Chemical Co. . The mixture was briefly agitated and was allowed to stand at room temperature for 24 hours, giving a crystalline precipitate. After refrigeration for 3 days at 4 C, the mixture was filtered, and the solid was washed with 1.5 L ethyl acetate. The solid was dried at 40 C for 6 hours under vacuum to constant weight, yielding 154.9 g, 0.39 mol., 62.0 recovery of a white solid, mp 149 151 C. In order to determine the isomer ratio, a small sample of the salt was regenerated to the acid by appropriately scaling down the procedure described on page 10 under REGENERATION OF 4 TH RECRYSTALLIZATION . HPLC of this product yields the isomer ratio. The salt product from the 1st crystallization 153.5 g, 0.387 moles is dissolved in 12.62 L of 98.6 ethyl acetate 1.3 methanol at 65 C. This is allowed to cool to room temperature with occasional agitation over five hours, giving a fibrous, solid precipitate. The mixture is refrigerated overnight at 3 C. The solid is filtered, washed with 1 L ethyl acetate and is dried to constant weight in vacuo at 40 C, giving a white solid, 123.5 g, 0.31 moles, 80.4 recovery mp 150 3 C. The isomer ratio of the product of the second crystallization is determined by regeneration of the acid from the salt as mentioned before, giving a white solid. The salt product from the 2nd crystallization 122.2 g, 0.31 mole is dissolved on 6 L hot ethyl acetate 99 methanol 1 . The mixture is cooled to room temperature over 4 hours with occasional agitation, followed by refrigeration at 3 C overnight. A solid precipitates, which is filtered, washed with 1 L ETOAC and dried to constant weight in vacuo at 40 C giving a white solid, 107.8 g, 0.2 moles, 88 recovery. mp 151 153 C. The isomer ratio of the product of the third crystal lization is determined by regeneration of the acid from the salt as mentioned before, giving a white solid, mp 114 118 C The salt product from the 3rd crystallization 105.9 g, 0.27 moles is dissolved in 4.5 L hot ethyl acetate 99.5 methanol 0.5 . The mixture is cooled to room temperature over 2 hours, followed by refrigeration at 3 C overnight. A solid is filtered off, washed with 1.0 L ethyl acetate, and dried to constant weight in vacuo at 40 C, giving a white solid, 97.8 g, 0.246 moles, 90.7 recovery, mp 153 4 C. The isomer ratio of the product of the fourth crystal lization is determined by regeneration of the acid from the salt as mentioned before giving a white solid, mp 118 120 C. The salt product of the 4th crystallization 95.5 g, 0.24 moles is suspended on 3 L ethyl acetate at 0 C. The mixture is extracted twice with 500 ml 1 The resultant solution is then gradually cooled to room temperature, followed by removal of diethyl ether in vacuo. The mixture is refrigerated at 3 C over night, giving a precipitate. The solid is filtered, washed with 1 L hexane, and dried to constant weight in vacuo at 40 C, giving a white solid, 58.1 g, 0.21 moles, 87.6 recovery. Mp 118 120 C. 71.7 overall yield of the available 3S, 4S isomer. Rich, et al., in For synthetic purposes, it may be desirable to leave the Boc protecting group intact however the product can be converted to statine by removing the protecting group via conventional techniques. Removal via acidification, eg., with dilute trifluoroacetic acid or other suitable reagent in preferred. While the invention is described above as employing four crystallization steps, it is contemplated that a lesser or greater number of such steps be used. Other conventional recovery techniques may be used in combination with or, in place of, one or more of the steps described above.
