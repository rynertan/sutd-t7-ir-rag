In known farrowing pens having a central sow pen and two piglet pens provided on the sides of the sow pen, the floor height of the sow pen is equal to or sligthly lower than the floor height of the piglet pens, and the width of the sow pen is suffi ciently large to permit the sow to stand up or lie down easily. According to the present invention, the floor height of the sow pen 1 is hgher than the floor height of the piglet pens 2 , and the width of the sow pen 1 is the minimum required to allow the sow to lie down or slightly larger than that. This arrange ment protects piglets against being crushed to death by the sow, and enables them to have an equal opportunity of taking the sow s milk. The invention is applicable to other livestock animals.
