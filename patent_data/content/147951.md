# A child resistant and tamper resistant container and closure assembly.

## Abstract
This invention provides a tubular container body and closure assembly with a smooth or flush outside surface. The assembly is provided with bayonet type child resistant means and tear away band tamper resistant means. The container body has a recess to receive a teartab on the tear away band so that the flush outside surface is maintained, the recess in the body being so positioned that when the tear tab is aligned with the recess an internal bead on the closure forming part of the bayonet type means is aligned with an external locking slot on the body so that the closure can be applied to the body by a longitudinal downward movement.
