# CATALYTIC METAL OF REDUCED PARTICLE SIZE

## Abstract
A catalytic adsorbate suspended in an aqueous solution comprising reduced catalytic metal on an organic suspend ing agent where the reduced catalytic metal has a maximum dimension not exceeding 500 angstroms and the organic suspending agent is one capable of complexing with ions of the catalytic metal. The catalytic adsorbate is useful for the electroless metal deposition of substrates that are non catalytic to electroless metal deposition.
