# Embedding material useful in preparing glass ceramic products.

## Abstract
An embedment material suitable for use in heat treating glass castings to convert them into glass ceramic articles, whereby the shrinkage customarily experienced resulting from densification of the casting during conversion to a glass ceramic is minimized and sound glass ceramic articles of tight dimensional tolerances can be produced contains an inorganic component which is subject to an inversion accom panied with a large change in volume at a temperature below the set point of the glass ceramic article demonstrates a coefficient of thermal expansion equal to or not more than 40 x 10 ‚Å∑ C units greater than that exhibited by the glass ceramic article displays a refractoriness sufficient to resist thermal deformation and slumping and be resistant to a phase change at the temperature employed to convert the glass casting to a glass ceramic article and is inert to the glass and glass ceramic. One such material consists essentially, by weight, of 5 30 plaster of Paris and 70 95 leucite.
