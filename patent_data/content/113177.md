# Tractor front loader.

## Abstract
In front loaders designed for drive in attachment to tractors, a detachable main portion of the loader has been supported, when not in use, at its front end by its bucket and at its rear end by two struts pivotable between stowed and deployed positions. Also, loaders in general have usually been provided with struts for temporarily locking in its fully raised position the boom assembly which is pivotable by hydraulic cylinders and carries the bucket. Economy of design is achieved by employing two telescopic struts 58 pivotable between a stowed retracted position alongside the boom assembly 21 a first deployed extended position for supporting the rear end of the detachable main portion, aided by auxiliary struts 35 , when it is not attached to the tractor and a second deployed extended position, alongside the hydraulic cylinders 27 which pivot the boom assembly 21 , for locking the boom assembly 21 in its fully raised position whilst the detachable main portion is attached to the tractor.
