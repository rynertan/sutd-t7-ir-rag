# Drinking straw.

## Abstract
An extendable drinking straw including outer and inner straws 1, 2 . When extended, an enlarged diameter portion 1a formed at the end of the inner straw 1 slides within the outer straw and is engaged with a narrowed diameter portion 2a formed at an end of the outer straw, preventing the inner straw from coming off of the outer straw. Even if the straws are pulled in opposite directions to be extended or even if the inner straw is pushed into the outer straw, the inner straw is prevented from coming off of the outer straw, because the end of the inner straw 1 , sticking out of the narrowed diameter portion of the outer straw 2 , is formed with an expanded diameter portion 1b . The same results are obtained by forming the end of the outer straw 2 , located opposite to the narrowed diameter portion 2a , into a reduced diameter portion 2b . Furthermore, an inwardly protruding portion 3 is formed on the outer straw 2 in such a manner that the enlarged diameter portion 1a of the inner straw 1 can pass over this protruding portion 3 . Thus, the inner straw and the outer straw are prevented from getting pushed and or inserted into each other when used in the extended state, securing the straw in its extended state and making it easy to use.

## Description
DRINKING STRAWBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a drinking straw, and more particularly to an expandable, double structured drinking straw. 2. Prior Art An expandable straw is designed to be freely lengthened and shortened in length by sliding and fitting together its inner straw part and outer straw part. The straw is adjusted to a suitable length when used and can be kept short when not in use. This type of straw is disclosed inJapanese Patent Application Laid Open No.1976 36364, JapaneseUtility Model Patent Application Laid Open Nos.1979 65784, 1984 21284, and 1984 66731 and also in the United States PatentsNos.2,192,036, 2,192,037, 3,776,458, etc. The straws mentioned above are inserted into bottles beforehand or are sealed in bottles. However, most of the above mentioned types of straws are supplied to the users in separate bags or in bags attached to paper packs, containers, etc. These straws include those provided with stoppers for preventing the inner and outer straw parts from getting separted from each other when they are extended, and those having no such stoppers. The straw without a stopper is defective because the inner straw and outer straw tend to separate from each other when the straw is taken out of a bag, when the straw is placed in a bottle and extended for use after removing the cap of the bottle, and when the straw is inserted into the container, and even during the use of the straw for drinking. On the other hand, straws provided with stoppers are still likely to separate when the inner and outer parts are pulled in direction opposite to the extending direction, or, on the contrary, when they are pushed in the reverse direction, during the packing process or transportation, or upon use when the straw is taken out from the bag. Thus, even drinking straws with stoppers have problems not only in use or from a sanitary standpoint, but also in their handling during manufacturing or transportation. There is another type of straw which, in additon to having stoppers for preventing slipping off in the extending direction, is provided with a band form piece. This band form piece keeps the engagement portions of the inner and outer straws connected when the straw is not in use and the piece is torn upon use. In this straw, although possible detachment of the inner and outer straws can be avoided, the band form piece, upon use, has to be broken. Besides, the band form piece raises the cost of manufacturing the straws. Another drawback is that the inner and outer straws are mutually pushed into each other when inserting into a package, etc., thereby making insertion difficult. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention eli minates the problems in the existing straws. A general object of the invention is to provide a new and improved drinking straw. The invention provides an ordinary type drinking straw which is not inserted in a bottle in advance. Another object of this invention is to provide a drinking straw which is simple in structure, low in cost, and easy to handle. Another object of this invention is to provide a drinking straw featuring that inner and outer straws are prevented from coming separated from each other not only during use but also during the process of sealing the straws into bags or during transportation under any conditions, that it can be used by extending the straw to a sufficient length for drinking, that it prevents either the inner straw or outer straw from dropping into the container during use, and that it does not need any extra component for preventing the inner and outer straws from slipping off of each other. Still another object of this invention is to provide a straw which does not loosen when extended and also once extended, the inner and outer straws are prevented from mutually slipping back into each other, thus making it possible to use the straw of this invention in a fully extended state. The objects described above are accomplished by a unique structure for a drink ing straw including an outer straw with one end narrowed by reducing the diameter, and an inner straw that slides within the outer straw being bulged by expanding its diameter. An anti slip portion, preventing the inner and outer straws from separated by pushing in motion, is also getting formed integrally on at least either one of the inne r and outer straws. More specifically, the objects are accomplished by a combination of an outer straw having a portion preventing slipping off, and an inner straw having enlarged diameter portions at one end sticking out of the outer straw and the other end being inserted in the outer straw.Another combination is an inner straw with an en. larged diameter at one end being inside the outer straw and an outer straw with reduced diameter ends. The object to prevent pushing in of the straw in a fully extended state is accomplished buy a stopper. The stopper is formed on the outer straw at the position where the edge of the bulged end of the inner straw is located when the straw is extended to its full length. This stopper is formed by pressing a part of the outer straw inward to the extent to allow the bulged portion of the inner straw to pass over it.DETAILED DESCRIPTIQN OF THE INVENTION The drawings show drinking straws of preferred embodiments of this invention, in which FIGURE l a is a side view showing the shortened state of the first embodiment of the straw FIGURE l b is a longitudinal sectional view thereof FIGURE 2 a is a side view showing the extended state thereof FIGURE 2 b is a longitudinal sectional view thereof FIGURE 3 I is a longitudinal sectional view showing the shortened state of the second embodiment of the straw FIGURE 3 II is a side view showing the extended state thereof FIGURE 4 I is a longitudinal sectional view showing the shortened state of the third embodiment of the straw FIGURE 4 II is a side view showing the lengthened state thereof FIGURE 5 I is a longitudinal sectional view showing the shortened state of the fourth embodiment of the straw and FIGURE 5 II is a side view showing the extended state thereof. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION A detailed description of the present invention will be given below with reference to the embodiments shown in the drawings. Figure l a is a side view showing the shortened state of the straw made of synthetic resin, etc. as Embodiment 1, andFigure l b is a vertical sectional view thereof. In the Figures, that denoted by 1 is an inner straw that is d in outside diameter. One end of the inner straw 1, being inserted in an outer straw 2, is formed into an enlargeddiameter portion la with a tapered portion. The enlargeddiameter portion la can slide along the inside of the outer straw 2. This enlarged diameter portion la has a fitting length L2. On the other hand, one end of the outer straw 2 with an inner diameter D is formed into a narrowed diameter portion 2a with a tapered portion. The inner diameter of the narroweddiameter portion 2a takes the size allowing the inner straw 1 to slide along. This narrowed diameter portion 2a of the outer straw 2 is also given a fitting length L1. With such a structure when the straw is extended, the enlarged diameter portion la and the narrowed diamenter portion 2a are engaged with each other at their tapered portions. Furthermore, the end of the inner straw 1, sticking out of the narrowed diameter portion 2a of the outer straw 2 and located opposite to the enlarged diameter portion lea of the inner straw 1, is formed into an expanded diameter portion lb. The diameter of this expanded diameter portion ib is larger than the outer diameter d of the inner straw i. The expanded diameter portion ib of the inner straw 1 serves as a stopper against slipping off. It is preferable that the sum of the length L of the narrowed diameter portion 2a of the outer straw and the length L 2 of the enlarged diameter portion la of the inner straw is at least equal to the length of the inside diameter D of the outer straw 2, i.e. L1 L2 D. This results in the straw being prevented effectively from getting loose and shaky when it is extended. Figure 2 a shows a side view of the extended state of the straw of Embodiment 1 and Figure 2 b is a longitudinal sectional view thereof. Specifically, the enlarged diameter portion la of the inner straw 1 and the narrowed diameter portion 2a of the outer straw 2 are brought to be engaged with each other at their tapered surfaces by pulling both ends of the inner and outer straws in opposite directions. The inner straw 1 and the outer straw 2 come to effect the airtight fitting by engaging tightly at their engagement portions, causing no leakage therebetween. Figure 3 I is a longitudinal sectional oiew showing the shortened state of the straw as Embodiment 2, and Figure 3 II is a side view showing the extended state thereof. In the Figures, the numeral 1 is the inner straw with the outside diameter d. The same as in Embodiment 1, one end la of this inner straw 1 is formed into the enlarged diameter portion la in a manner that this enlarged diameter portion la can slide along the inside of the outer straw 2 . This enlargeddiameter portion la has a fitting length L2. On the other hand, one of the ends of the outer straw 2 having the inside diameter D is formed into narrowed diameter portion 2a with the diameter reduced to allow the inner straw 1 to slide along the inner circumference of this narrowed diameter portion 2a . Also, a certain fitting length L 1 is given to this narrowed diameter portion 2a . Thus, when the straw is extended, the enlarged diameter portion la and the narrowed diameter portion 2a are engaged each other at their tapered surfaces which are continuous respectively to these enlarged diameter portion la and narroweddiameter portion 2a . In addition, the end of the outer straw 2 , located opposite to the narrowed diameter portion 2a , is formed into the reduced diameter portion 2b . The inside diameter of the reduced diameter portion 2b is somewhat smaller than the inside diameter D of the outer straw 2 . This reduced diameter portion 2b prevents the straws parts from being separated. As to the length of the narrowed diameter portion 2a and that of the enlarged diameter portion la , the same requirement as in Embodiment 1 applies. Figure 3 II is a side view showing the extended state of the straw in Figure 3 I . The enlarged diameter portion la of the inner straw 1 and the narrowed diameter portion 2a of the outer straw 2 are engaged to each other by means of their tapered surfaces. This engagement is made by pulling the inner and outer straws in opposite directions with both end of the r straw held with the fingers. Figure 4 I is a longitudinal sectional view showing the contracted state of the straw as Embodiment 3. The internal surface of the outer straw shown inEmbodiment 1 is formed with protruding portion 3. The protruding portion 3 prevents the inner and outer straws from getting pushed into each other after the straw is extended to its full length. The protruding portion 3, formed on the inner surface of the outer straw c, is at the position where the outside of the end of the enlarged diameter portion la of the inner straw 1 is located when the eniarged diameter portion la of the inner straw 1 and the narrowed diameter ,portion 2a of the outer straw 2 are engaged to each other by eans fo their tapered surfaces which are formed continuously to those enlarged diameter portion la and narrowed diameter portion 2a, respectively, in the fully extended state effected for the straw. This protruding portion 3 limits the inward protrusion to the extent that the enlarged diameter portion la passes over it. The protruding portion 3 shown here is formed by pressing inward the whole circumferential line of the outer circumference of the outer straw 2. The protrusion may be provided in other different ways such as three inwardly projected points along the circumferential line. In short, the essential requirements for this protruding portion 3 are that it allows the enlarged diameter portion la of the inner straw 1 to pass through it easily, and that it blocks the foregoing enlarged diameter portion la from getting pushed back into the outer straw 2. It means that this protruding portion 3 prevents the inner and outer straws from inadvertently getting pushed into each other while the straw is used in the fully extended state, as shown in Figure 4 II , by pulling the inner and outer straws in mutually opposite directions. Figure 5 I is a longitudinal sectional view showing the shortened state of the straw of Embodiment 4. In this embodiment, the protruding portion 3 is formed on the inner surface of the outer straw 2 as shown in Figure 3 or Embodiment 2. The protruding portion 3 prevents the outer and inner straws from getting pushed into each other after the straw is extended to its full length. This protruding portion 3 is formed in the same manner as that applied to the protruding portion 3 of the outer straw 2 shown in Figure 4. Figure 5 II shows the same straw extended for drinking. The drinking straw provided by the present invention is constructed as exemplified by Embodiments 1 through 4. The straw is packed in a contracted form in a bag and attached to a paper pack or container, etc. In use, the straw is extended by holding and pulling the ends of the inner and outer straws respectively with the fingers. The enlarged diameter portion of the inner straw and the narrowed diameter portion of the outer straw are engaged with each other tightly at their engagement portions, thus effecting the airtight fitting. As a result, the air is prevented from flowing in through the engaged portion while sucking the drink through the straw, ensuring smooth drinking. The straw can be extended sufficiently for drinking without both the inner and outer straws being separated from each other. Neither the inner or outer straws come off or drop into the container during use of the straw while drinking. Also, even when, by mistake, the straw is pulled in the direction opposite to the extending direction or the inner straw is pushed into the outer straw, the inner straw does not come off of the outer straw. This engagement is made secure by the expanded diameter portion Ib of the inner straw 1, that is sticking out from the outer straw 2, as seen in Embodiment 1 and 3 see Figures 1, 2 and 4 , or by the reduced diameter portion 2b of the outer straw 2 shown in Embodiments 2 and 4, that is located opposite to the end to which the bulged end of the inner straw 1 is sticking out see Figures 3 and 5 . Therefore, under any handling conditions, no problems such as slipping off is caused. Furthermore, with an appropriate length for the enlarged diameter portion of the inner straw and for the narrowed diameter portion of the outer straw, the mutual support of the inner straw and the outer straw can be consolidated, preventing loosening and shakiness during sucking the drink through the straw. In addition, the protruding portion on the internal surface of the outer straw, being a stopping means, prevents the inner straw and the outer straw from pushing into each other, which might occur upon insertion of the straw into a container.Therefore, the straw can be used in the completely extended state. r As should be apparent from the above description according to the present invention, with an improvement or partial modification to the construction of the inner and outer straws, it becomes possible to provide a straw that is low in manufacturing cost and that is convenient to handle not only during its use, but also during manufacturing as well as during transportation.
