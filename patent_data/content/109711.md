# Record disc player.

## Abstract
For loading a record disc on the turntable of a record disc player, a loading device is provided which comprises a movable loading support 32, 34, 36 for supporting a holder 38 containing a record disc 22 . The loading support is slidably supported between two fixed, parallel, vertical guide plates 28 and 30 by pins 50 and 52 an the support sliding in L shaped guide slots 54 and 56 in the guide plates, each slot having a vertical section extending downwardly from a horizontal section. Slidably supported on the outer sides of the guide plates for horizontal movement in vertical planes parallel to the planes of the guide plates are two drive plates 68 having inclined slots 78 and 80 in which the pins on the loading support slidably engage. By cooperation between the inclined slots and the pins the drive plates can move the loading support, guided by the L shaped slots in the guide plates, along a horizontal path and down a vertical path to deposit the record disc supported on the loading support on the turntable. Pivotally supported between the guide plates is an arm 58 carrying a pressure member 66 for urging the loaded disc into a centred position on the turntable. The arm is pivotable between an inoperative position and an operative position about a horizontal axis and comprises two plates 60 which are movable in vertical planes adjacent the guide plates and which are each formed with a recess 64 which, when the arm is in the inoperative position, is located beside and coincides with the horizontal section of one of the guide slots in the adjacent guide plate at a position such that when the pin on the loading support which engages in that guide slot reaches the end of the horizontal section of the slot during the loading movement of the loading support, the pin enters the respective recess, and as the pins move down the vertical sections of the respective guide slots they cooperate with the recesses to move the arm to the operative position.
