## Description
The present invention relates to an apparatus for detecting the position of a moving member, and particularly, to a position detecting apparatus using magnetoresistive elements. It is known that when a magnetoresistive element made of a magnetoresistive material such as permalloy is placed in the magnetic field with a current conducted therethrough, the resistance R of the element varies depending on the intensity of the magnetic field H, as shown in Fig. 6. By using a magnetoresistive element in place of the usual magnetic head, it is possible to detect information recorded magnetically on a magnetic recording medium at its zero speed with respect to the magnetoresistive element, i.e., in a stationary state of the medium. It is also known that this principle of the magnetoresistive element is applicable to the detection of the moving speed, moving direction and position of a moving member which rotates or travels along a straight line. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,319,188 discloses a rotation detecting system with a plurality of magnetoresistive elements for detecting the angular position, rotational speed and rotational direction of a rotating member which carries information in a magnetic form. The inventors of the present invention have developed, in advance of this invention, a position detecting system, which will first be described with reference to Figs. 1 through 5. A motor 1 has a drive shaft 2 with a magnetic drum 5 coupled thereto, and signals are recorded magnetically on the circumferential surface of the drum 5. Confronting the drum surface, a magnetic sensor 4 consisting of magnetoresistive elements is fixed to the motor 1 by a magnetic sensor fixture 3. Fig. 2 shows by expansion the positional relationship between the magnetic drum 5 and the magnetic sensor 4. For the wavelength λ electrical angle of 2π of the recording signal, magnetoresistive elements R₁₁ R₁₄ and R₂₁ R₂₄ are arranged at an interval of λ 4 in the magnetic sensor 4 as shown in Fig. 2. These magnetoresistive elements are connected as shown in Fig. 3 to form two sets of bridge circuit. The output e₁ across terminals a₁ and b₁ of one bridge circuit and the output e₂ across terminals a₂ and b₂ of another bridge circuit are conducted to amplifiers OP In the foregoing conventional magnetic encoder, it is requested to increase the number of pulses per revolution so that the accuracy of the control system which employs the encoder is improved. In this case, however, if the wavelength λ of the recording signal, i.e., the recording pitch shown in Fig. 2, is made shorter, the magnetic field strength to the magnetic sensor 4 decreases and thus the outputs e₁ and e₂ fall unless the clearance CL between the magnetic sensor 1 and the magnetic drum 5 shown in Fig. 1 is made smaller. A narrower clearance CL will pose problems of assembling accuracy and eccentricity of the motor 1. The magnetic drum 5 may have a larger diameter, but it invites disadvantageously the larger inertia and bulkiness. Alternatively, the magnetic rotation sensor may be arranged to provide three or more final outputs, but, at a cost of increased number of magnetoresistive elements and a complex control system and wiring for converting multi phase signals into dual output signals, since it is a common practice in servo motor control systems to use dual output signals from rotation sensors. US A 4,039,936 discloses a rotation detecting system with a plurality of magnetoresistive elements and permanent magnets for detecting the angular position of a rotating member having a plurality of teeth, wherein three outputs in separate phases produced by the magnetoresistive elements are processed so that the output with a frequency three times that of each output is obtained. The output frequency of this prior art system may be increased by increasing the number of teeth of the rotating member, but, at a risk of machining accuracy. EP A 0 048 983 discloses an apparatus as set forth in the first part of claim 1. Two pairs of magnetoresistive elements are disposed on the stationary sensor such that the interval between the two elements of each pair corresponds to the mutual spacing of magnetized portions on the moving member, i.e. 2π, and the interval between the two pairs of magnetoresistive elements corresponds to an angle of π 2. The output signals produced by differential amplifier circuits, to which the magnetoresistive elements are connected, are the same as those shown in Fig. 5 referred to above. It is an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus for detecting the position of a moving member in rotation or linear motion which provides the improved accuracy of detection at the minimum number of magnetoresistive elements by increasing the number of pulses per revolution or unit traveling length, without reducing the wavelength λ 2π of the magnetic recording signal nor increasing the diameter of the magnetic drum or disk. Preferred embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the drawings, in which Before entering into the embodiments of the present invention, the fundamental idea of the invention will first be described in connection with Figs. 7 through 12. In Fig. 7, the arrangement includes a magnetic moving member M such as a magnetic drum, magnetic disk or a linear motion member, and a magnetic sensor N incorporating magnetoresistive elements MR elements R Making reference to the output e With respect to the output e The circuit of Fig. 10 provides a phase difference of π π 4 between the outputs, so that the signal e The connection of Fig. 11 provides a phase difference of π π 4 between the outputs. The output e Thus, the fundamentals of the present invention are to combine five sets of signals among the outputs e The embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to Figs. 13 through 40, where signals and components identical to those shown in Figs. 7 through 11 are referred to by the common symbols. Fig. 13 shows the first embodiment of the invention, in which the number of phases m is selected to be four. In the figure, five MR elements are disposed in a 4 phase magnetic sensor N in such a way that an element R The following describes the multi phase to 2 phase conversion of this embodiment. The MR elements are connected to respective three terminals as shown in Fig. 14 and a voltage V is applied to the ends of the 3 terminal connections so that voltage outputs e As mentioned previously, the MR element has a variable resistance responsive to the magnetic field, and when the moving member M shown in Fig. 13 travels to the right the MR elements provide varying resistances as shown by A through H in Fig. 15. In Fig. 15, one set of MR elements R As stated previously, the outputs of the MR elements have a phase difference of 5 8 λ, i.e., 5 4 π which is larger than π 2 and the outputs are combined as follows to obtain m phase, i.e., 4 phase, outputs as shown by A D in Fig. 18. Namely, differential voltages between outputs e The signals e Thereafter, the first output signal Ea and the third output signal Ec, and the second output signal Eb and the fourth output signal Ed are combined respectively, i.e., odd numbered phase outputs and even numbered phase outputs are paired on exclusive OR gates EOR₁ and EOR₂ or other waveform combine circuits, respectively, as shown in Fig. 17, so that the 2 phase outputs OA and OB carrying positional information of the moving member are obtained as shown by I and J in Fig. 18. The 2 phase outputs OA and OB have a frequency output pulses twice that of the intermediate signals Ea through Ed, with a phase difference of π 2 in an electrical angle between the two outputs. When the moving member M moves reversely, i.e., from right to left, the phase relationship of the waveforms shown in Fig. 15 reverses, causing the 2 phase outputs OA and OB shown by I and J in Fig. 18 to have the opposite phase relationship, and the output OB leads the output OA by π 2 as shown in Fig. 19. According to this embodiment, as described above, the number of output pulses is doubled without changing the wavelength λ of the signal recorded on the magnetic moving member M. The number of MR elements is ten as shown in Fig. 13, the only increase of two from the conventional arrangement with eight elements shown in Fig. 2. The 2 phase outputs have a phase difference of π 2, with its polarity depending on the moving direction, allowing discrimination of moving direction in the same way as the conventional system. In the foregoing embodiment, it should be noted that the MR elements in 3 terminal connections as described with Fig. 13 may be simple resistors, and also the MR elements wired may separately be mounted on another member instead of being disposed within the sensor. Output conversion takes place automatically due to the connection of each section in response to the movement of the moving member, and this is common to all embodiments of the invention. The second embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to Figs. 20 and 21. Five MR elements R The third embodiment will be described with reference to Figs. 22 through 24. In Fig. 22, five MR elements R The fourth embodiment will be described with reference to Figs. 25 through 27 in Fig. 25, MR elements of m 1 5 in number are disposed with a spacing of 7 8 λ, i.e., for n 2 and m 4, n 1 m π 7 4π, where λ is the wavelength of the recording signal, within a magnetic sensor N. In addition, resistors R Also in this embodiment, the resistors R The fifth embodiment will be described with reference to Figs. 28 through 30. In Fig. 28, MR elements R Also in this embodiment, the resistors R Fig. 31 shows the connection of MR elements and resistors in the multi phase magnetic sensor according to the sixth embodiment of the invention. The arrangement employs the disposition of MR elements of the third embodiment shown in Fig. 22, but with different connections for the resistors R Although various combinations of disposition for MR elements are possible in the foregoing embodiments for 4 phase sensors m 4 , the basic arrangement is the provision of a phase difference of λ 2m, i.e., π m, for the number of phases of m, and this value is added by π or the value of π is subtracted by π m to form individual dispositions. In the connection diagrams referred to in the foregoing embodiments, the output terminals for output e Next, the 6 phase magnetic sensor m 6 according to the present invention will be described with reference to Figs. 32 through 36. In Fig. 32, seven MR elements R Accordingly, the outputs e These are the arrangements using m 1 sets of magnetoresistive elements. The following describes an example using m sets of magnetoresistive elements with reference to Figs. 37 through 40. With the disposition of MR elements as shown in Fig. 37, the movement of the magnetic moving member M causes the resistance of the MR elements R Although the foregoing embodiments are of 4 phase or 6 phase, the present invention is applicable to realize multi phase magnetic sensors of even number of phases, such as 8 phase, 10 phase, 12 phase, etc., by using MR elements larger in number by one set than the number of phases m, or MR elements equal in number to m. The advantages of the present invention are summarized in the following.
