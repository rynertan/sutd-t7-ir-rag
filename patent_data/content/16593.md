# Optically coupled remote control system.

## Abstract
Apparatus for controlling the operation of an articulated loading arm comprises a light source 62 connected by opti cal fibres 61a 61n to a plurality of manually operable optical switches Sl Sn , the switches being connected by optical fibres 64a 64n to a plurality of light operated actuators 63a 63n . The optical switches can include a rotary multiple position switch having discrete positions or incorporating a variable density filter or a pair of mutually rotatable polarising filters.
