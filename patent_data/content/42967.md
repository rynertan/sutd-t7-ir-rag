# Mutiple data flow component system.

## Abstract
A Large Scale Integration LSI data flow component is described for use as a building block, the component being capable of use singly or in combination to provide data flow paths and functions of different data widths for a processor or microprocessor. A component with an eight bit data flow is described as a byte slice , wherein individual byte control 5 is provided within a multiple byte configuration so that single data flow components within the group can operate independently of other components under control of exter nal logic. Components may operate on a stand alone, a multiple byte, or nonactive byte basis. A control scheme permits functions of one component to be influenced by actions or logic of another component to permit efficient implementation of arithmetic algorithms.
