# Electroconductive ceramics.

## Abstract
Electroconductive ceramics with high density, high me chanical strength, high endurance to repeated current supply and excellent thermal shock resistance can be obtained by mix ing 5 to 70 parts by weight of Al₂O₃ or alumina ceramics con taining 95 by weight or more of Al₂O₃ and 30 to 95 parts by weight of at least one electroconductive material selected from of ZrB₂, ZrC, ZrN, ZrSi₂, TaB₂, TaC, TaSi₂, TiB₂, TiC, TiN, Mo₂B₅ and MoSi₂ adding a molding binder, molding the mix ture and sintering the molding. The electroconductive ceram ics is usable for heaters, glow plug heaters, electrical gas igni tors, kerosine gasifying burners, and electrodes or conductors for water processing or dialysis,
