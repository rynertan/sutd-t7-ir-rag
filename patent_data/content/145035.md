## Description
RUBBER BASED IMPACT RESISTANCE IMPROVER AND A PROCESS OF PRODUCING SUCH AN IMPACT RESISTANCE IMPROVER The invention relates to a new rubber based impact resistance improver characterized in that it consists at least of a 10 parts by weight of carboxylated rubber, b O 25 parts by weight of uncarboxylated rubber, and c 1 20 parts by weight of a polymer at least consisting of vinyl alcohol groups and vinyl chloride groups in a molar ratio of between 1 5 and 1 50, preferably between 1 8 and 1 20. Preferably, the polymer composition according to the invention consists at least of a 10 parts by weight of carboxylated rubber, b O 15 parts by weight of uncarboxylated rubber, and c 2 10 parts by weight of the said polymer which at least consists of vinyl alcohol groups and vinyl chloride groups. In most cases the carboxylated rubber used is a carboxylated ethylene propylene diene rubber EPDM rubber containing, for instance, 0.1 10 Z by weight of maleic anhydride groups. A suitable way of preparing such a carboxylated ethylene propylene diene rubber, and examples of such rubbers, are mentioned in British Patent No. 1,436,981, to the contents of which reference is here made for brevity. An uncarboxylated rubber that can be suitably employed is an ethylene propylene rubber EPM rubber and or an ethylene propylene diene rubber EPDM rubber . A suitable way of preparing the polymer which at least consists of vinyl alcohol groups and vinyl chloride groups is copolymerization of vinyl acetate and vinyl chloride followed by saponification of the resulting polymer. In addition to the monomer groups mentioned, the polymer may contain minor amounts, e.g. up to 30 mol Z, of other monomer groups. Suitable monomers are ethylene, vinylidine chloride, vinyl esters of carboxylic acids with, e.g. 1 20 C atoms per carboxylic acid molecule, by preference 1 6 C atoms per molecule of carboxylic acid, such as vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate, etc. The impact resistance improver of this invention may, if so desired, contain additives, such as stabilizers, processing aids, e.g.lubricants, pigments, fillers, polymeric additives, etc. The impact resistance improver according to the invention is extremely suitable for improvement of the impact resistance of vinyl chloride homo and copolymers containing at least 70 mol X vinyl chloride units and can be employed also in other polymers, e.g. in ABS,SAN and polyvinylidene chloride. It is mostly used in amounts of 1 25 parts by weight of impact resistance improver to 100 parts by weight of polymer. The impact resistance improver according to the invention can be prepared in a known manner from the several ingredients, by methods usually employed for the purpose. In dependence on the form in which the ingredients are available powder, crumb, liquid , various apparatuses or combinations thereof may be applied, such as mixing rollers, a rapid mixer, Banbury mixer, kneader extruder, etc. A very suitable way of preparing the impact resistance improver according to the invention consists in that a mixing device, e.g. a pair of mixing rollers, is fed with the desired amount, e.g. 20 parts by weight, of carboxylated rubber, the desired amount, e.g. 1 20 parts by weight, of a polymer which at least consists of vinyl alcohol groups and vinyl chloride groups in a molar ratio of between 1 5 and 1 50 and, optionally, the desired amount, e.g. 0 25 parts by weight, of uncarboxylated rubber, and by preference, per 100 parts by weight of rubber, 0.1 20 parts by weight of one or more conventional esterification accelerators, e.g. esterification accelerators based on an organic metal compound, such as dibutyl tin maleate, tetrabutoxy titanium, magnesium stearate and or zinc stearate, and, optionally, further ingredients.Thereafter these substances are mixed for 0.5 120 minutes, preferably for 1 30 minutes, at a temperature of 425 500 K, by preference at 425 475 K. Next, the resulting mixture is, if so desired, subjected to extraction with a solvent for the said polymer which at least consists of vinyl alcohol groups and vinyl chloride groups so as to extract polymer not bound to the carboxylated rubber. It is possible afterwards to isolate the said polymer from the extract, which polymer can then be re used in the production of the impact resistance improver.Suitable extraction agents are substances in which the said polymer is readily soluble whereas the rubber employed is poorly soluble in them, e.g. acetone. A polymer composition that has been given impact resistance by means of an impact resistance improver according to the invention is particularly suitable for the manufacture of objects which have to satisfy high requirements as regards mechanical and physical properties, such as impact resistance, stiffness, etc., e.g. pipes, bottles, furniture elements, dashboards for motorcars, casings and housings for electronic equipment and domestic appliances, heels for shoes, caravans, skis and surfboards.
