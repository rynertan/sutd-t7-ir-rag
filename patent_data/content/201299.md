# Method and apparatus for adding solid alloying ingredients to molten metal stream.

## Abstract
An elongated, vertical conduit has an upper end, com municating with the bottom opening in a upper container or la dle, and an open lower end disposed above the top surface of a bath of molten metal in a lower container or tundish. A descending stream of molten metal is directed from the conduit into the bath. A shroud encloses the conduit and the descend ing stream. The pressure within the shroud is lower than the outside pressure and is regulated. A mixture of transport gas and solid, particulate alloying ingredient prone to excessive fuming is injected into the descending stream within the shroud.
