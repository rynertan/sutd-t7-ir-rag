# A metal air cell.

## Abstract
The invention provides a metal air button cell 10 that provides improved leak proof properties without requiring a significant expense in manufacturing costs. The cell 10 is composed of a cathode can 12 , a saucer shaped cover 14 which is electrically insulated from the can by a grommet 16 that extends over the outer sides and the rim of the cover. A cathode assembly 24 is located in the cathode can 12 and extends to the walls 18 thereof. A resilient washer 44 is placed between the cathode assembly 24 and that part of the grommet 16 that covers the rim of the cover 14 . Anode material 40 is provided together with a separator 36 to prevent shorting between anode and cathode mate rial. The cell 10 is sealed by crimping the top edge of the can 12 against the grommet 16 which compresses the cathode between the can and the washer 44 .
