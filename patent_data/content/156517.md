# Containers.

## Abstract
A container for contaminated materials having an upper entry chute 29 and a hinged door 12 which normally hangs vertically closing the inner end of the chute. When the con tainer is full the door 12 can be lifted until hooks 39 at its lower end engage in apertures 42 in the lid of the container and the whole door can then be pivoted into a closed position closing the entry opening to the chute and thus providing protection from the contaminated chute surface 29 . The door has barbed detents 44 which engage in apertures 48 to hold the door positively sealed in its final closed position. In the example there is a separate hinged closure 72 for closing the outer end of the entry chute.
