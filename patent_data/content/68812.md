# Load support arrangement.

## Abstract
A load support arrangement, more especially a shelving system for storage purposes, comprises a main upright 1 and a relatively adjustable cantilever arm 7, 8 held by means 11, 12 for frictionally engaging the upright at vertically spaced positions on opposite sides of a part of the upright, under load applied to the cantilever arm. In addition, in order to prevent slippage of the cantilever arm when lightly loaded, the arm has engagement means 11a, 12a for engaging opposite sides of a portion 4, 5 of the upright at positions spaced horizontally, and locking means 9, 14 is provided for canting the cantilever arm in a horizontal plane to urge the latter engagement means into pressure contact with said upright. Preferably, a common load support includes two such cantilever arms arranged sym metrically about a vertical plane, and said locking means is ar ranged to cause relative movement of the cantilever arms at right angles to the vertical plane.
