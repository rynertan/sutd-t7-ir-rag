# Vacuum modulator valve and subassembly therefor.

## Abstract
A vacuum regulator valve 10 comprises a force balance modulator valve subassembly 114, 118, 119, 122, 124, 126 mounted to a housing 12, 30 having inlet 14 and outlet 16 fluid ports. A vent insert 114 is adjustably biased through a biasing spring 166 by a rotary cam arrangement which includes a spring 64 biased rotary input member 48 rotatably mounted on a housing tubular projection 40 . A ring shaped drive member 144 is rotatable with input member 48 and supports a cup shaped cam member 154 . As projections 152 on the reaction member 144 rotate relative to cam surfaces 160 , the cam follower is moved linearly relative to the vent insert. Locking tabs 50, 146, 148, 150 and alignment grooves 46, 80, 96, 98 enable the cam arrangement to be assembled in a predetermined angular position and locked to the housing without fasteners. An externally accessible adjustment member 162 enables valve calibration after final assembly. A dish shaped spring 138 reacts against the vent insert and plate members 134, 136 for stabilizing and centering the vent insert.
