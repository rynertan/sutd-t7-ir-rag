## Description
NOVEL AZO RBOXYLIC ESTERS USEFUL AS POLYMERISATION INITIATORS AND PROCESS FOR THEIR MANUFACTURE This invention relates to novel organic azo compounds which are useful as initiators for the polymerisation of ethylenically unsaturated monomers, and to a process for their manufacture. The use of organic azo compounds as initiators in the aqueous emulsion polymerisation of ethylenically unsaturated monomers is well known and extensively described in the literature. Illustrations of such compounds are azobis 2 methylpropionitrile , 4,4 azobis 4 cyanopentanoic acid , 2,2 azobis 2 cyanoethyl pbenzoic acid , 4,4 azobis 4 cyano n pentanol , 2,2 azobis 4 aminc 2, 4 dimethylvaleronitrile and l,l azo bis 1 cyanocy lohexane . According to one aspect of the present invention there are provided azo carboxylic esters having the general formula EMI1.1 in which R is the residue of an aliphatic polyhydroxycompound R OH q l after removal of one hydroxyl group therefrom, R1 is a methyl or ethyl group or a grouping of theformula COO CnH2nO p R R OH q R2 is a methyl group or a B carboxyethoxygroup and R3 is a methyl group or an ethyl group, or R2 and R3 together with the intermediate carbon atom fDrm a cyclohexyl group R4 is a methyl group and R5 is a methyl group, an ethyl group, a B carboxy ethzxy group or a ss methoxy ssss dimethylethyl group, orR4 and R5 together with the intermediate carbon atom form a cyclohexyl group n has one or more of the values 2, 3 and 4, p is zero or an integer from 1 to 100, preferably from 1 to 50, and q has the value 2 or 4. According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a process for the manufacture of azo carboxylic esters as defined in formula I , the process comprising reacting an azonitrile of the formulaEMI2.1 wherein R1 is a methyl group, an ethyl group or a nitrile group, and R2, R3, R4 and R5 have the same significance as in formula I , with a stoichiometrically equivalent amount of an acetal or ketal derivative having the formulaEMI2.2 wherein R, n, p and q have the same significance as in formula I , R6 is hydrogen or an alkyl or aryl group and R7 is an alkyl or aryl group, or R6 and R7 together with the intermediate carbon atom form a cycloalkyl group, in the presence of hydrogen chloride gas under anhydrous conditions, followed by simultaneous hydrolysis of the intermediate iminoether hydrochloride and of the acetal or ketal grouping or groupings. The azo moiety of the compounds I may be derived from such azonitriles II as 2,2 azobis 2 methylpropionitrile , 2,2 azobis 2 methylbutyronitrile , 4,4 azobis 4 cyanopentanoic acid , l,l azobis 1 cyanocyclo hexane , 2 2 methylpropan 2 azo 2 cyano 4 methoxy 4 methylpentane, 1 2 methylpropan 2 azo 1 cyanocyclo hexane , 1 2 methylbutan 2 azo 1 cyanocyclohexane, 2 2 methylpropan 2 azo 2 cyanopropane and 2 2 methyl propan 2 azo 2 cyanobutane. The ester moiety of the compounds I may be derived from polyhydroxy compounds III having 3 or 5 hydroxyl groups, or from a poly alkyleneoxy derivative of such a compound in which only one of the hydroxyl groups is substituted by a polyether chain. The poly alkyleneoxy chain may consist entirely of ethyleneoxy units, or of propyleneoxy units, or of butyleneoxy units, or it may include units of any two or all three of these types.Furthermore, in the latter case, the different units may be arranged within the chain either randomly or in blocks.Examples of suitable polyhydroxy compounds include glycerol, trimethylolpropane, 1,2,6 hexanetriol and carbohydrates such as Dglucofuranose together with their condensates with alkylene oxides such as ethylene oxide, propylene oxide and butylene oxide or mixtures thereof, provided that, as already indicated, in the case of the condensates the alkylene oxide units all form a single chain attached to the site of only one of the hydroxyl groups of the polyhydroxy compound. The azocompounds of the invention may be obtained from the corresponding azonitriles by means of the modified Pinner reaction defined above. The monohydroxy compound with which the azonitrile is reacted is an acetal or ketal derivative of the polyhydroxy compound R OH q 1 in which one pair, or two pairs as the case may be, of hydroxyl groups are blocked by being incorporated into 1 3 dioxolan or 1 3 dioxan ring systems. The acetal or ketal derivatives are themselves well known substances which are produced by condensing the polyhydroxy compound, under anhydrous conditions in the presence of a catalyst, with the appropriate aldehyde or ketone, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, cyclohexanone, benzaldehyde or acetophenone.Suitable derivatives include 2,2 dimethyl l, 3 dioxolan 4 methanol 1 2 0 isopropylidene glycerol and its condensate with 4, 6, 8 or 30 moles of ethylene oxide respectively, the corresponding 2 phenyl , 2 phenyl 2methyl , 2 methyl 2 ethyl and 2,2 spiro cyclohexyl derivatives of l,3 dioxolan 4 methanol, together with the ethylene oxide condensates thereof, also l,2 5,6 di O isopropylidene glucofuranose and its ethylene oxide condensates. Where it is desired to use the alkylene oxide condensates, these will normally be obtained by preparing the acetal or ketal derivative first and then condensing this with the alkylene oxide s in the presence of an alkaline catalyst, towards which the dioxolan or dioxan ring structure is stable. According to the conventional procedure for carrying out the Pinner reaction, as originally described in Chem.Ber. 1883, 16, 352 and 1643, a nitrile is converted to the corresponding iminoether hydrochloride by treatment with an alcohol in the presence of hydrogen chloride gas under anhydrous conditions, the alcohol being used in stoichiometric excess so as to ensure complete conversion of the nitrile. In suitable cases, particularly when the lower aliphatic alcohols are used, the iminoether hydrochloride precipitates out from the reaction mixture and can be separated from unreacted alcohol, following which it may be hydrolysed to give the corresponding carboxylic ester. However, in many other instances, the iminoether salt does not precipitate out and its isolation can then be very troublesome.The need to use an excess of the hydroxy compound is also a disadvantage when that compound is expensive or notfreely available. In ourEMI5.1 Application No.EMI5.2 there is described a modification of the Pinner procedure according to which there is used only a stoichiometric proportion of hydroxy compound to nitrile and the reaction is carried out in the presence of a compound containing an ether grouping. In a particular embodiment of this modified procedure, the hydroxy compound itself contains the ether grouping, and this same feature is utilised in the process of the present invention, where the dioxolan or dioxan ring in the compound III serves to provide the necessary ether groupings. As described in the above mentioned Application, the reaction between the azonitrile I and the monohydroxy compound III is most conveniently brought about by bubbling dry hydrogen chloride gas through the mixture of these reagents until the mixture is saturated, the temperature of the mixture preferably being held below about 10 C by suitable cooling. When saturation has been achieved, the reaction mixture may be allowed to warm up to room temperature, at which the conversion of the nitrile to the iminoether hydrochloride normally occurs satisfactorily over a period of some days. It is not usually desirable to carry out the conversion at temperatures much above ambient since the iminoether salt formed may then decompose to form the corresponding amide. If a faster conversion is desired,this may be achieved by increasing the concentration of hydrogen chloride in the reaction mixture by introducing it under pressure. If desired, the reaction mixture may also contain a liquid diluent or solvent which is inert towards 2ny of the other reactants and which preferably is sufficiently volatile to be removed, after the reaction s complete, by evaporation at a relatively low temper zture if necessary under reduced pressure in order not to cause decomposition of the iminoether salt. Particularly suitable diluents include dichloromethane and chloroform benzene and toluene may also be used,for example where complete removal of the diluent from the iminoether salt is not necessary. Completion of the conversion of the nitrile to the iminoether hydrochloride may most conveniently be recognised by the absence of the characteristic nitrile l group peak at 2250 cm , on infrared spectroscopic examin ation of the reaction mixture. The iminoether hydrochloride, in those cases where it separates as a solid from the reaction mixture, may be separated by filtration and, where it does separate, may be isolated by removing the liquid diluent and hydrogen chloride, preferably at about room temperature and, if necessary, under reduced pressure as already mentioned. Further purification of the iminoether salt may be carried out if required, but this is often a matter of some difficulty owing to the limited stability of this class of compound, and normally it is unnecessary since the compound in question is required only as an intermediate product. Hydrolysis of the iminoether hydrochloride to the carboxylic ester may be accomplished simply by adding the hydrochloride to water at room temperature, and simultaneously there takes place hydrolysis of the acetal or ketal groupings in the ester moiety, giving rise to free hydroxyl groups. The desired product is in most cases best isolated by extraction into an inert solvent, such as dichloromethane, followed by evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure. The resulting azocarboxylic esters I are valuable as free radical forming initiators for the polymerisation of ethylenically unsaturated monomers. By virtue of the free hydroxyl groups which they contain, they are in general readily soluble in water and are therefore particularly suitable for use in aqueous emulsion polymerisation procedures, or in the aqueous dispersion polymerisation processes described in BritishApplication No. 2039497A.
