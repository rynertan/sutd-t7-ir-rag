# Easily split substrates for the quantification of proteases, a process for their production and a method for the quantification of proteases.

## Abstract
Easily split enzyme substrates for the quantification of proteases having the general formula R₁ p Glu A₁ A₂ NH R₂, wherein R₁ H or a protective group, preferably t butyl oxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl A₁ Gly, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Ser, Thr, Pro, Pip, Phe or Tyr A₂ Arg or Lys R₂ an aromatic, possibly substituted, hydrocarbon group, wherein NH R₂ is a physico chemically determinable group, preferably a chromogenic or fluorogenic group which is split by a present enzyme and then forms a cleavage product of the formula H₂N R₂ the amount of which can be quantified. Process for the production of said substrates. Method in the laboratory diagnostics of proteases using said substrates.
