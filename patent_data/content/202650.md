# Method of controlling a tape deck display.

## Abstract
A method of display control is disclosed for an audio tape deck having a display unit employing an array of light emitting segments, whereby both data relating to playback audio signals and tape transport data can be selectively dis played in the same display region. Any change in operating status from a normal play mode of operation during display of audio playback signal data is sensed, causing changeover to display of tape transport data, and after a fixed time has elapsed following return to the play mode the display of audio playback signal data is restored.
