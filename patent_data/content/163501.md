# Comb shaped piezoelectric drive unit.

## Abstract
A comb shaped piezoelectric drive unit, such as may be used for a mechanical signal source or in a display device for displaying raised letters for reading by blind persons, includes a plurality of strip shaped drive members 1b 1,...1b n extending from a common base part 1a , a first metal electrode layer 111a on one face of each of the drive members and electrically insulated from one another, and a common metal electrode layer 111b formed on the other face of the drive members. Pins may be attached to the free ends of each of the drive members, the pins being protrud able through respective holes in a rigid plate when the corresponding drive members are actuated by applying a voltage thereto, to form a touch sensitive display for the blind.
