# A fixation bandage.

## Abstract
A fixation bandage made from elastic material and adapted to hold a dressing such as a compress or the like firmly in a position on a peripheral body portion, such as a hand, a foot or the head of a person, is mainly formed as a hose in one piece preferably by knitting or crocheting. The hose comprises a holding portion 7 adapted to receive the body portion, a fastening portion 5 and at least one gap 3 . The fastening portion 5 forms a cuff, a collar or the like, which is intended to embrace a joint, such as a hand joint, an ankle joint or the neck of a person, immediately adjacent the respective body portion. The fixation bandage is so shaped and has an elasticity such that both the holding portion 7 and the fastening portion 5 can be slipped over the body portion in such a manner as to have its fastening portion placed around the adjacent joint. By means of the flexible and elastic fixation bandage thus provided the firm holding of the dressing in position is ensured, even in the case of extreme movements of the body. Moreover, the fixation bandage is easy to apply whether this is done by the injured person or by a person assisting him in the application of the fixation bandage.
