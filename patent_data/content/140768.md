# A SEMICONDUCTOR MEMORY DEVICE

## Abstract
A bipolar static memory device comprising clamping cir cuits Q6 to sustain the potential on the word lines WL in non selected state at a specified level is disclosed. Each of the high potential side word lines WL is connected to a clamping circuit Q6 formed from a pnpn transistor whose base is supplied with a reference voltage V
