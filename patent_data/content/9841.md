# A duct system containing a movable plug body and a method for determining possible leakage in a duct system.

## Abstract
A duct system containing a movable plug body 110 and a method for determining possible leakage in such a duct system. The duct system has retaining stations 1,2,3 to retain the plug body 110 . The invention aims at a more simple and versatile system of this type. To cause the plug body 110 to continue its movement through the duct after being retained in such a station, the pressure difference of a fluid in the duct between both sides of the plug body 110 is increased, e.g. by a pump 13 , and the pump may be control led by control means 14 with programmed retention times of the plug body 110 in the several stations. Pressures, fluid flow quantities at 10 and 12 and or power of the pump drive may be measured and applied to the control unit to determine the position and movement of the plug body 110 . The system may be used to discharge the fluid from the duct at the retaining stations, e.g. water for irrigation purposes at long distances and or for measuring leakage in a long duct. Special transfer means 4 may be applied to transmit the plug body 110 from the downstream end of the duct 5 to the upstream end thereof 8 .
