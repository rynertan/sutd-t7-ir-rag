# Optical semiconductor detector and process for fabrication thereof.

## Abstract
An optical semiconductor detector for optical to elec trical signal conversion can be accomplished through the use of a detector made up of a semiconductor body 2 having a width W comparable to the diameter of the sig nal conveying optical fiber 10 , the end of which is aligned with the width face of the semiconductor body, and n and p conductivity type regions 6, 7 are provided along the length dimension of the body, the magnitude of the length dimension further defining an optical ath length within the body that is correlated with the light wavelength. Arrays of such structures can be offset ¹ ₂ structure width and the groove between the sides of the structures may then be employed for optical fiber alignment to an adjacent detec tor. The detectors can be fabricated out of silicon grown on a preferred crystallographic orientation.
