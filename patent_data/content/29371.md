# ASSEMBLIES COMPRISING SEMICONDUCTOR ELECTRODES

## Abstract
An assembly comprising al least two semiconductor electrodes 19, 20 each of the semiconductor electrodes having a positive and negative surface, and an electrolyte 27 for electrically connecting the surfaces of opposite polarity of said semiconductor electrodes, the electrolyte comprising at least one redox couple capable of reversible redox reaction with one of the surface of opposite polarity of the electrodes whereby the composition of said electro lyte remains substantially unchanged as charge is passed between said electrodes..
