# Silicone foam suppressant compositions.

## Abstract
Silicone foam suppressant compositions are disclosed consisting essentially of a low viscosity polydimethylsiloxane and a high viscosity polydimethyl siloxane, a certain siloxane resin, and amorphous silica. These foam suppressant com positions can be used to suppress foam in both aqueous and hydrocarbon liquids. Advantageously, these foam suppres sant compositions employ less of the resin and less amorph ous silica than are normally found in silicone foam suppres sants.
