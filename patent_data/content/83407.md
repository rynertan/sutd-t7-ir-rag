# Method and apparatus for generating a noiseless sliding block code for a 2,7 channel with rate 1 2.

## Abstract
An algorithm and the hardware embodiment for producing a run length limited code useful in magnetic recording channels are described. The system described produces sequences which have a minimum of 2 zeros and a maximum of 7 zeros between adjacent 1 s. The code is generated by a sequential scheme that maps 1 bit of uncon strained into 2 bits of constrained data. The encoder is a finite state machine whose internal state description re quires 3 bits. It possesses the feature of reset data blocks which reset it to a fixed state. The decoder requires a lookahead of three future channel symbols 6 bits and its operation is channel state independent. The error propaga tion due to a random error is 3 bits. The hardware imple mentation is extremely simple and can operate at very high data speeds.
