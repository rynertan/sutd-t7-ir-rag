# AQUEOUS BASED URETHANE COATING COMPOSITIONS

## Abstract
Aqueous urethanes having improved physical properties in addition to excellent flame retardant properties are obtained when a combination of a halogenated diol, such as an alkoxylated tetrabromobisphenol A, or dibromoneopentyl glycol and a second diol which contains either a carboxy group, a sulphonate group or a tertiary amine group is incorporated in the urethane.
