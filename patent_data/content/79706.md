# Digital data transmissions with bit arbitration.

## Abstract
In a digital data communications system having a plurality of slaved data transceivers transmitting data to, and receiving data from, a master station, the master station classifies a received signal, in each of a multiplicity of bit time intervals as one or the other of the pair of binary signal states. The received binary signal state is echoed to all of the slaved stations, to cause those stations which did not previously transmit that binary state to cease transmitting data. Those slave stations which transmitted the echoed previous bit binary state then transmit the next bit of data, which is again echoed. Slaved stations receiving bit echoes which are different from the previous bit sent will know that there has been a collision and that the master station did not receive their bit of data, whereby the number of slave stations transmitting is reduced, in successive bit time intervals, unit only one slave station remains transmitting. The initial portion of the message of the one remaining station need not be repeated, whereby system time is not lost.
