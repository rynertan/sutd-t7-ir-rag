## Description
Simultaneous collection of diffraction and spectro graphic data. The present invention involves a system for simultaneously obtaining diffraction type data and spectrographic type data in analyses of materials. In particular, the present invention involves the use of a proportional detector structure for simultaneous collection of diffracted radiation and fluorescent radiation from a specimen being irradiated, and thereafter selecting either the diffracted radiation or the fluorescent radiation for analysis. A proportional detector produces an output pulse height proportional to the energy of the incident photon. It is estimated that several million atomic arrangements are present on the earth, and each of these arrangements will give a diffraction pattern which is unique to that arrangement. Because of the large number of possibilities, great similarities may exist between single phases leading to an even greater difficulty in the analysis of multiple phases. In recent years, considerable interest has evolved in the combination of spectro me try with X ray diffraction arrangements. This interest has occurred because of the fact that the X ray fluorescence method offers additional information which can aid in the phase identification process. Because the success or failure of correctly interpreting diffraction data depends on many factors, including the experience of the experimenter, the quality of the data in the unknown pattern, preconceived ideas as to the probable composition of the specimen, and the availability of other information about the specimen, considerable difficulty has evolved in making qualitative identification.For example, the majority of analytical problems involve multi phase materials wherein the greatest problem in qualitative identification is the unscrambling of the various phase patterns to allow matches to be madeth a file of standard reference patterns of pure materials which contains about 30,000 entries. Since most phases will given some 10 to 30 lines in the angular region of identification, and since each of these lines has a half height width of about O.3Q in the diffracted beam, a four to five phase mixture may given an extremely complex diffrac to gram with many line superpositions. Moreover the possibility exists of line broadening and line displacements due to instrumental or specimen artifacts. Prior art attempts at combining X ray diffractometry and X ray spectrometry have been made especially in the areas of energy dispersive spectrometry and wave length.dispersive diffractometry. See, for example, R.Jenkins, INTERDEPENDENCE OF X RAY DIFFRACTION AND X RAYFLUORESCENCE DATA, Advances in X ray P3Lalysis, Vol. 21, pages 7 21, 1978 and R. Jenkins, THE ROLE OF THE ENERGYDISPERSIVE DETECTOR IN X RAY DIFFRACTOMETRY, Proc. A.C.A.Workship, pages 43 54, 1977. As are emphasized in these prior art references, spectrographic and diffractometry type instrumentation can be combined only with some difficulty. The present invention involves an arrangement for simultaneously collecting diffraction and spectrographic data by the use of a proportional detector which collects characteristic diffracted photons and fluorescent photons from a specimen being irradiated. This proportional detector is connected to a computer controlled programmable pulse height selector to select either diffracted primary photons from the source of fluoresced characteristic photons from the specimen. The computer control can be arranged so that the diffracted primary photons or the fluoresced characteristic photons are sampled in one hundredth of a second so that viewing of both appears to be simultaneous. By this arrangement, simultaneous collection of diffraction and fluorescence emission data can be obtained in order to provide both diffraction data and fluores cence emission data in those cases where use of additional elemental data is critical to obtaining accurate analysis such as, for example, in the study of pot flux samples.In particular, the controlled pulse height selector can provide selection during a quantitative data collection scan, and fluorescence emission and diffracted photon measurements can be stored in different data files for work up at the end of the data collection. This enables a quantitative phase analysis where the diffraction data along is insufficient for complete solution. In a preferred embodiment a second pulse selector is added such that no loss of information occurs due to the alternate measurement of the height of the pulses. The structure of the present invention may be more clearly seen by reference to the drawing figures which illustrate without limitation various aspects in schematic form of the arrangement of the present invention, and wherein Figure 1 illustrates schematically an arrangement according to the present invention, and Figure 2 illustrates in graphic form pulse measurements according to the present invention. As may be seen in Figure 1, radiation 3 from a source 2 is directed onto a specimen 1 in the normal diffractormeter arrangement in which the specimen 1 is placed at the center of a gonimeter, with the normal to its surface making an angle e wzth the primary beam. A proportional detector 6 is placed at an angle 29 from the primary beam in such a position as to collect diffracted primary photons 4. Also, fluorescent characteristic emission 5 is also directed into the same proportional detector 6. As shown in Fig. 2, the detector produces voltage pulses of sizes V1 and V2 relating to the energy E1 and E of the diffracted photons and fluorescent photons respectively. In the voltage versus time graph shown in Figure 2, pulses of an average voltage level V1 can be collected with a pulse height range of S1, while pulses of an average voltage level V2 can be collected with a pulse height range of S2. These values give a distinct indication and separation of diffracted photons from fluorescent photons. A computer controlled, programmable pulse height selector 7 is used to select either diffracted photons from a source or fluoresced photons from the specimen. This selection is made during a quantitative data collection scan, and both diffracted photons and fluorescence emission are stored in different data files, i.e. in the data files 8 and 9 of the computer 10. In this manner, simultaneous collection of diffraction data and fluorescence emission data are obtained. While various arrangements and features of the present invention have been illustrated and described, the present invention includes all modifications and variations which may be evident from the claims.
