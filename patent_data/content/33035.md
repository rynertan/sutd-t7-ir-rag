# Fluid tight electrical connector device.

## Abstract
The device is for use with an ultra low temperature cable for supplying external electrical current to a motor of a pump located in a storage tank or vessel. An insulating sleeve 33 having a external flange 132 and an internal thread 131 screw threadingly engaged with an electrically conductive rod 34 having a screw thread 141 thereon. A sealing member 43 is interposed between the sleeve 33 and rod 34. The cou pled sleeve 33 and rod 34 extend through an aperture in a main metal body 31 with the flange 132 of the insulating sleeve 33 and the metal body 31 being held in contact with each other, preferably through a packing 39, so as to provide a fluid tight structure, by a metal support 32 which is secured to the body 31 by at least one bolt 35.
