## Description
ClOGGING PREVENTIVE DEVICE FOR ME PRINTING AND APPLYI3JG MBCHNE The present invention relates to a label printing and applying machine of portable or desk type, and particularly to a clogging preventive device for preventing the label printing and applying machine from being clogged with labels.More particularly, the present invention relates to a label printing and applying machine of the above type for preventing such a printing platen of the label printing and applying machine, which is made responsive to the squeezing operation of a hand lever toward a grip lever to feed a continuous label strip composed of a series of self adhesive labels carried through an adhesive upon a strip of carrier paper onto the printing platen, as is made operative to print and guide the continuous label strip,with the labels due to the adhesive which frequently flows out of the side edges of the label strip.Conventionally, the printing platen of that type is constructed to have its upper surface formed with a guide recess, which is sized to have substantially the same width as that of the continuous label strip so as to guide the same while continuously contacting with the both side edges of the label strip.In case, however, the label printing and applying machine of that type is used in summer in the tropics or in an area of higher temperature than a proper level, or in case the storing condition of the continuous label strip is bad, the adhesive will frequently flow out of the both side edges of the label strip until it sticks to the printing platen. As a result, the adhesive will further stick to the both guide walls defining the guide recess of the printing platen so that it provides an obstacle against the forward movement of the label strip.If the adhesive having stuck to the guide walls grows a lump of the adhesive, the continuous label strip fails to be held in a horizontal position upon the printing platen thereby to form a raised portion, thus deteriorating the resultant printing effects.On the other hand, moreover, there is stored in the label guide recess of the printing platen a label residue such as label chips which are produced when the cuts and perforations of the labels and carrier paper are formed in the label strip. The label residue thus produced will also provide an obstacle against the movement of the label strip.It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a clogging preventive device for use with a label printing and applying machine, which device is free from those drawbacks concomitant with the prior art.Another but major object of the present invention is to provide a clogging preventive device of the above type, which is operative to eliminate the troubles, which might otherwise take place at the printing platen due to the adhesive of the labels and the label residue, thereby to ensure the smooth feed of the continuous label strip.According to a major feature of the present invention there is provided a clogging preventive device for use with a label printing and applying machine including a printing platen for guiding a continuous strip of labels, in which a series of self adhesive labels are carried on a strip of their carrier paper by means of an adhesive, wherein the improvement comprises a pair of juxtaposed label guide walls formed to longitudinally extend at the both sides of said printing platen and label relief means for receiving the continuous label strip so that at least the both label side portions may be prevented from contacting with said label guide walls.In the drawings Fig. 1 is a partially sectional side elevation showing the whole construction of a label printing and applying machine equipped with the clogging preventive device of the invention Fig. 2 is a section taken along line II II of Fig. I Fig. 3 is a perspective view showing a printing platen constituting a major portion of the present invention Fig. 4 a cross section showing the relationship between the platen and the label strip according to a first embodiment Fig. 5 is a perspective view showing the platen of Fig. 4 Figs. 6 to 8 are similar to Fig. 5 but show second, third and fourth embodiments of the invention and Fig. 9 is an enlarged perspective view showing a continuous strip label, in which self adhesive labels and their carrier paper are adhered temporarily.Before entering into the detailed description of the clogging preventive device according to the present invention, a label printing and applying machine of portable type will be generally described with reference toFigs. 1 and 2 in case it is equipped with the clogging preventive device.As shown, a head carrying lever 3 composed of a pair of side plates is arranged to have its trailing end hinged by means of a pivot pin 4 to an upper trailing end portion of a pair of machine frames A such that it is biased upward or clockwise by the biasing force of a return spring 5 at all times. A printing head 6 is carried on the leading end portion of the head carrying lever 3. Indicated at reference numeral 7 is an inking roller which is operative to apply ink to the type bearing surface of the printing head 6. A hand lever 8 to be manually squeezed toward and released from a grip lever 2 is made integral with the head carrying lever 3.As can be better seen from Fig. 2, a feed roller 17 for feeding a continuoussbvip of labels L is formed on its circumference with two rows of radial feed teeth 9 and 10, a pressure groove 18 defined between the feed teeth 9 and 10, and a one way clutch 20. The feed roller 17 thus formed is mounted on its shaft 21 which in turn is pivotted to the machine frames 1. With close reference toFigs. 1 and 2, to the side plate 11 depending from the lower rear portion of the afore mentioned head carrying lever 3, there is hinged a ratchet pawl 12 which is biased to rotate counter clockwise of Fig. 1 by the biasing force of a torsion spring 14.Indicated at reference numeral 16 is a ratchet wheel which can engage with the ratchet pawl 12 in response to the releasing operation of the hand lever 8 so as to turn the feed roller 17 intermittently by one pitch between the adjacent feed teeth 9 and 10.Turning now to Fig. 3, there is hinged to the feed roller 17 a printing platen 40 which forms a part of the clogging preventive device according to the present invention.This detail will be described later, and short discussion is made in the following. The printing platen 40 is arranged between the paired machine frames I and formed with a platen surface 41 of such a recessed cross section as is formed with a pair of juxtaposed label guide walls 42 which are formed slightly higher than the thickness of the continuous label strip IL. The printing platen 40 thus arranged and formed is made to have a knife edge shape at its leading end. The trailing end of the printing platen 40 is extended to form a pair of arm plates 43 at its both sides. Below the arm plates 43, there are formed a pair of shaft holes 44, in which the shaft 21 of the feed roller 17 is fitted. Incidentally, there are mounted to the arm plates 43 a pair of connecting members 45 which in turn are hinged to a later described label holding member 26 by means of a pin 27.Reverting to Fig. 1, a pair of label holding members 38 forming accessory parts of the clogging preventive device of the present invention are composed of shelf shaped beams which are made to extend inwardly of the machine frames 1.The label guide walls 42 of the afore mentioned printing platen 40 are made to abut against the lower sides of the label holding members 38, thus forming such a thin passage 39 as to barely admit the continuous label strip IL. There is arranged above the afore mentioned feed roller 17 a label holding member 26 of an arcuate shape which is elastically biased toward the feed roller 17 by means of a spring member 24. The label holding member 26 is formed at its front back side with an abutment surface, which is in abutment contact with the upper sides of the label guide walls 42 of the afore mentioned printing platen 40, thus forming a label feed passage 22 which is slightly thicker than the continuous label strip IL. On the other hand, a bottom cover 28 located below the machine frames 1 is constructed to have its leading end hinged to the machine frames 1 by means of a pivot pin 29 such that it can be opened clockwise and its trailing end retained on the machine frames 1 by means of a locking device 30. The bottom cover 28 has its center portion made integral with a carrier paper guide member 31, which in turn has its inclined carrier paper receiving surface 32 positioned below the leading end portion of the afore mentioned label holding members 38, thus forming a peeling turning portion 33 of a restricted clearance between the carrier paper receiving surface 32 and label holding members 38. On the other hand, a carrier paper holding spring 24a is forced into engagement with the pressure groove 18 which is formed between the feed teeth 9 and 10 carried on the feed roller 17.In front of the printing platen 40, there is located a label applying device 36 which is supported pivotally on a pivot pin 35 in the vicinity of a label outlet 34. Above the machine frames 1, moreover, there is located a label roller holder 37 which is used to hold the continuous label strip It stored in the rolled shape.Turning to Fig. 9, the continuous label strip It to be used with the clogging preventive device according to the present invention is composed of a series of self adhesive labels 60 and a strip of carrier paper 61 carrying the labels 60 through an adhesive 62 which is applied to the backs of the labels 60. With closer reference to Fig. 9, in order that the label strip L can be advanced by its engagement with the feed teeth 9 and 10 of the feed roller 17, the backing paper strip 61 is formed with a series of perforations 64 at such positions as correspond to the cuts 63 formed between any adjacent labels 60a peeled from the backing paper strip 61. In order to facilitate the separation of the labels 60a having the adhesive 62, moreover, a parting agent such as silicone oil is applied to the surface of the backing paper strip 16. Incidentally, the both side portions La of the label strip L are used merely to illustrate the side edges 65, lower side portions 65 and upper side portions 67, as is also shown in Fig. 4.In order to enable the clogging preventive device of the present invention to be understood more, the printing and feeding operations of the continuous label strip L thus prepared will be generally discussed in the following.When the printing operations of the labels 60 of the label strip L is to be performed, the hand lever 8 is squeezed toward the grip lever 2 so that the head carrying lever 3 is turned downward about the pivot pin 4. In response to the downward rotation of the head carrying lever 3, the inking roller 7 is brought to turn on the type bearing surface of the printing head 6 so as to supply the same with ink. As the squeezing operation of the hand lever 8 further proceeds, the printing head 6 is finally brought into abutment contact with one of the labels 60, which have been fed onto the printing platen 41 by that time, so that the printing operation is effected with its type bearing surface.On the other hand, the feeding operation of the label strip IL is performed by releasing the squeezed hand lever 8.During this release, the label strip L engaging with the feed teeth of the feed roller 17 at the upper circumference thereof is fed by the intermittent rotation of the feed roller 17. As a result, the printed foremost label 60a is advanced upon the printing platen 41 to the leading end thereof. At the afore mentioned peeling turning portion 33, the foremost label 60a thus advanced is peeled from the carrier paper 61 due to its own rigidity by the turning action of a small loop of the carrier paper 61 formed. In the meantime, on the other hand, the carrier paper 61 is advanced along the lower side of the printing platen in the backward direction of the hand labeler until it restores its engagement with the feed teeth 9 and 10 of the feed roller 17 at the lower circumference thereof so as to effect its tensile action.Incidentally, the label 60a thus peeled is prepared by the pushing actions of both the label holding members 38 arranged above the printing platen 41 and the carrier paper receiving surface 32 formed below the printing platen 41.After having been separated from the carrier paper 61, the foremost label 60a is adhered to a commodity or the like by means of the label applying device 36.The clogging preventive device according to the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to Figs. 4 to 8.A first embodiment of the clogging preventive device of the present invention is shown in Figs. 4 and 5, in which printing platen 40 is formed, according to a first feature of the present invention, with a label receiving recess 46 having a larger width b than that a of the continuous label strip L, As shown, the label receiving recess 46 is defined between the label guide walls 42 which are juxtaposed widthwise of the printing plate 41 and is made to extend longitudinally thereof. As a result, the label side portions La, more specifically, the side edges 65 of the label strip L can be prevented from contacting with the label guide walls 42, thus leaving both side clearances 47 inbetween.According to a second feature of the present invention, there are formed in the upper surface of the printing platen 41 a pair of elongated label relief grooves 48 which are arranged at the both side corners of the aforementioned label receiving recess 46 and which are cut deeper than the recess 46. As a result, the both lower side portions 66 of the label strip L can be prevented from contacting with the label receiving recess 46.According to a third feature of the present invention, moreover, the label holding members 38, which are arranged above the printing platen 41 in a manner to extend from the machine frames 1, are formed at their lower sides with a pair of elongated label relief grooves 38a which correspond to the afore mentioned label relief grooves 48, and at its inner lower side with a label guide surfaces 38b which will contact with the label strip L. As a result, the both upper side portions of the label strip L can be prevented from contacting with the label holding members 38. These label holding members 38 are used in the label peeling system thus described in the fore going embodiments, in which the continuous label strip L is subjected to the pushing and pulling actions. However, the label holding members 38 can be dispensed within the system, in which pins are provided either at the leading end or in the longitudinal direction of the printing platen 41 so that the labels may be peeled from the label strip L by pulling the carrier paper 61 only. According to a fourth feature of the present invention, still moreover, in case the printing platen 41 has its upper surface formed with the label receiving recess 46 which has the larger width b than that a of the contin uous label strip IL, this label strip L may meander while being advanced because its side portions La are prevented from contacting with the label guide walls 42. As a countermeasure of this trouble, the printing platen is formed at its lower side with a carrier paper guide recess 50 which has the same width as that of the carrier paper 61 separated from the labels 60. As a result, the label strip IL can be advanced straight as a whole upon the printing platen 41.According to a fifth feature of the present invention still moreover, both of the label relief grooves 48 formed in the longFtudinal direction of the printing platen 41 are formed with two series of through slots 49 which are arranged at a suitable spacing from one another. As a result, the residue of the labels such as their chips, which might otherwise drop down upon the printing platen 41 from the continuous label strip IL so that it is stored thereon, can be discharged to the outside through the through holes 49. Incidentally, the label residue is produced, when the cuts 63 connecting temporarily the lables 60a of the label strip IL and the perforations 64 of their carrier paper 61 are formed, and is stuck to the label strip L. The second embodiment of the present invention is shown in Fig. 6, in which the printing platen 40 has also its upper platen surface 41 formed with the label receiving recess 46 having the larger width b than that a of the continuous label strip L similarly to the first embodiment and having a flattened label sliding surface.Moreoever, the label receiving recess 46 is formed also at its both side corners with two series of the through holes 49, which are arranged at a suitable spacing in the longitudinal direction so as to permit the discharge of the label residue. The printing platen 41 is also formed at its lower side with the carrier paper guide recess 50 for the carrier paper 61.According to the third embodiment of the present invention shown in Fig. 7, the printing platen 41 having a similar construction to the first embodiment is formed with two series of label guide projections 51 which project from the label guide walls 42 so as to guide the label strip IL in a discontinuous manner. The label guide projections 51 thus formed are arranged to face each other at a spacing equal to the width a of the label strip L so that they can contact with the side edges 65 of the label strip L thereby to stabilize the forward movement of the same.In the fourth embodiment shown in Fig. 8, the printing platen 41 having a similar construction to the second embodiment is formed with the label guide projections 51 which also project from the label guide walls 42 so as to guide the label strip L in a similarly discontinuous manner,As has been described hereinbefore, the clogging preventive device according to the present invention has the foregoing constructions so that it can enjoy the following advantages 1 Since the label receiving recess which is formed in the upper surface of the printing platen between the juxtaposed label guide walls is made to have a larger width than the continuous label strip, this label strip can be prevented from having its both side edges contacting with the label receiving recess while being advanced.As a result, even if an adhesive flows out of the both side edges of the label strip, in which the labels are temporarily adhered to the carrying paper by means of the adhesive, it can be prevented from being stuck to the label guide walls so that the smooth label feed can be ensured to prevent the clogging with the adhesive with the resultant satisfactory printing effects. 2 Since the afore mentioned label receiving recess is formed at its both side corners with two rows of longitudinal label relief grooves, even both the lower side portions of the label strip can be prevented from contacting with the label receiving recess. As a result, the adhesive can be effectively prevented from being stuck. 3 Since, still moreover, the label holding members arranged above the printing platen are formed with a pair of elongated label relief grooves, the label strip is forced into contact with the upper surface of the printing platen so that the both upper side portions of the label strip can be prevented from contacting with the label holding members 38, in the case of the label peeling system in which the label strip is subjected to the pushing and pulling actions. As a result, the adhesive can be further effectively prevented from being stuck. 4 Since, still moreover, the printing platen is formed at its lower side with a carrier paper guide recess which has the same width as that of the carrier paper of the label strip, the label strip can be advanced straight as a whole by the carrier paper being guided in its guide recess even if the label strip is not guided upon theupper surface of the printing platen. 5 Since, still moreover, either the label relief grooves or label relief recess of the printing platen are formed at their both side corners with two series of through slots, the label residue which might otherwise be left on the platen, can be discharged to eliminate the label troubles.
