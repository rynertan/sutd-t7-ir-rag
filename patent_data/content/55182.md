# High speed nonvolatile electrically erasable memory cell and system.

## Abstract
A process for fabricating an electrically erasable nonvo latile memory cell comprises forming a first region of insulating material which is less than about 200 Angstroms thick on a selected surface portion of an electrically isolated relatively lithtly doped pocket of epitaxial silicon of a first conductivity type such that first and second surface areas of the epitaxial pocket are exposed. Regions of the epitaxial pocket underlying the first and second exposed surface areas are doped such that first and second relatively lightly doped epitaxial regions of a second conductivity type are formed in the epitaxial pocket. A first relatively heavily doped polysilicon region of the first conductivity type is formed on the first insulating region and a second relatively heavily doped polysilicon region of the first conductivity type is formed on the second relatively lightly doped epi taxial region. A second region of insulating material is formed over exposed surfaces of the first polysilicon region of the first conductivity type and a third region of insulating material is formed over exposed surfaces of the second polysilicon region of the first conductivity type such that first and second surface portions of the second relatively lightly doped epitaxial region are exposed. The regions of the epitaxial pocket underlying the surface of the first rela tively lightly doped epitaxial region and the first and second surface portions of the second relatively lightly doped epi taxial region are doped such that first, second and third relatively heavily doped epitaxial regions of the second conducitivity type are formed in the epitaxial pocket. A first relatively heavily doped polysilicon region of the second conductivity type is formed on the second insulating region and a second relatively heavily doped polysilicon region of the second conductivity type is formed on the third insulat ing region.
