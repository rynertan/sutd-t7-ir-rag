# Coating surfaces.

## Abstract
A coating material is applied to a surface, such as the back surface of carpeting, using a perforated roller 9 . The material is supplied to the outer surface of the roller 9 so as to form a well of material 10 on the surface 1 passing through the per forated body 11 of the roller 9 up to a second smaller roller 12 inside the perforated roller 9 . The roller 12 may be fixed or may be driven depending on the nature of the pattern to be applied to the coating material by the roller 9 .
