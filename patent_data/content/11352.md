# Method of and apparatus for testing electronic circuit assemblies and the like.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus are disclosed for identifying and locating faults in the portion of circuit assemblies con taining digital signals by conducting incircuit tests embody ing the application of uninterrupted sequences of signals to nodes of the circuits and the comparison of nodal signals to expected values, reducing the complex testing of the circuit assemblies to a series of simple tests of components or groups of components constituting the assemblies and, in connection with bus structured circuits, eliminating the pos sibility of bus contention problems in good circuit assemb lies under test.
