# Mask cleaning apparatus and automatic multilayer ceramic screening machine incorporating same.

## Abstract
Vertically displaceable green sheet support fixtures are borne by respective horizontally movable carriages 29, 31 traveling on common rails 28 between respective dual loading stations 12, 12a and a common unloading station 16 , through separate intermediate screening stations 14, 14a , within the carriages movable in opposite directions and out of phase stationwise. The carriages 29, 31 have fixedly coupled thereto, horizontally movable trailers 34, 34a which bear trays 46 of stacked green sheets for selective transfer of the uppermost green sheet to a loading head at the loading station 12, 12a while the carriage borne fixture itself is at a screening station for paste screening of a prior transferred green sheet. Masks employed in screen printing at the screening station are removed from the screening station console and placed in a cleaning chamber 112 for solvent removal of residual screening paste and are air dried prior to return to the screening station console. During cleaning of a dirty mask, a second clean mask is automatical ly presented at the station to eliminate throughput loss. The fixture is vertically displaceable on the carriage and its height incrementally varied depending upon green sheet thickness variation. Accelerated vertical separation of the carriage borne green sheet from the mask is effected subsequent to initial slow incremental separation therebetween.
