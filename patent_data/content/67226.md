# D.C. GENERATOR TYPE NON CONTACT SPEED SENSING DEVICE.

## Abstract
In a D.C. generator type non contact speed sensing device comprising a cylindrical magnet rotor with N and S poles alternating around the periphery and a stator with windings wound confronting the rotor, the non uniformity in the magnetization of the magnet causes the non uniformity in the magnetic flux density in the vicinity of the surface of the pole, so that the electromotive force induced in the windings fluctuates, resulting in an inaccurate speed sens ing. To overcome the problem, a rotor is constructed out of a permanent magnet 11 with magnetic poles aligned with the axial direction and yoke members 12 , 13 each of which is composed of a plane portion 15 in contact with the pole surface of the magnet and an elongated portion 16 normal to the plane portion and of such a form as covers the peripheral surface of the side portion of the magnet. Thus, the magnetic flux density over the surface of the yoke is made uniform and the fluctuation in the electromotive force induced in the windings, caused by the non uniformity in magnetization, is eliminated.

## Description
DESCRIPTION TITLE OF THE INVENTION A Non contacting Speed Detecting Device of a Direct current Generator Type TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a non contacting speed detecting device of a direct current generator type, and especially to the above mentioned device which uses a yoke member in order to equalize the distribution of the magnetic flux density in the magnetic pole of the rotator. BACKGROUND ART Conventionally, there is known as a non contacting speed detecting device of a DC generator type, a device wherein a generator, comprising a rotator consisting of a cylidrical permanent magnet having a plurality of magnetic poles along the circumferential direction and stator windings arranged along the circumference of said rotator, is designed to gain a DC voltage by switching multi phased trapezoidal waveform AC voltages obtained from the respective phases of the stator windings in their flat portions. The above mentioned speed detecting device of a prior art is illustrated in Fig. 1 A , B and C . Various voltage waveforms in the speed detecting device of Fig. 1 are illustrated in Fig. 2. In Fig. 1 A , a rotator 1 consists of a permanent magnet having four magnetic poles in its circumferential face and its axis is coupled to the axis of a rotating body to be measured. A stator 2 has a stator core and four phases of stator windings W1 , W2 , W3 and W4 wound through the slot portions of said stator core. When the rotator 1 rotates in the direction of the arrow r, shown in Fig. 1, alternating voltages, shown in Fig. 2 as V1 , V2 , V3 and V4 , are produced in the respective phases W1 , W2 , W3 and W4 of the windings wound in the stator.The waveforms of the respective phases are shifted by 900 in phase in the order of V1 , V2 , V3 and V4, Each of the waveforms has an approximately trapezoidal shape in half of each cycle, as shown in Fig. 2. Acwordingly, the value of the voltage is an approximately constant value V0 in the central portion of said trapezoidal waveform.Furthermore, this constant voltage value V0 is directly proportional to the rotating speed of the rotator 1 . The cycle time T of each waveform is inversely proportional to the rotating speed of the rotator 1 . By switching selectively only the above mentioned portions where the voltage value is constant in the waveform of each phase and inputing said portions into an amplifier circuit, a DC voltage output proportional to the rotating speed of the rotator 11 is obtained. The output waveform, obtained in the above mentioned manner, is shown as E in Fig. 2. At the portion where the outputs of two phases are overlapped, the output voltage is adjusted to become the mean value between these output voltages of two phases.The variance component, existing in the flat portion of the waveform of each phase, appears in the above mentioned DC output waveform as shown in E of Fig. 2. By the way, in the speed detecting device of Fig. 1, a voltage variance Vr of about 5 occurs because of the following reason. There is an inequality of the magnetization in the magnetic pole of the permanent magnet, generally due to the manufacturing method, and, therefore, there also occurs an inequality in the distribution of the magnetic flux density on the surface of the magnetic pole.The distribution of the magnetic flux density near the stator winding W1 wound in the slot 3 is shown in Fig. 1 B and C , in which Fig. 1 B illustrates the case where a portion in which the magnetic flux density, being relatively high, passes near the winding and Fig. 1 C illustrates the case where a portion in which the magnetic flux density, being relatively low, passes near the winding. In Fig. 1 B and 1 C , 101, 102, 103 and 104 indicate portions where the magnetization is relatively great. When the rotator 1 rotates at a constant speed, the electromotive force generated in the stator winding in the case of Fig. 1 B is greater than that in the case of Fig. 1 C . Therefore, a variance according to the inequality in the magnet occurs in the voltage signal E indicating the speed, so that the detection of the speed becomes inaccurate.This variance causes trouble, especially when a very small speed is detected. In order to improve this problem, there is proposed a structure in which a pole shoe is attached to the magnetic pole portion of the rotator however, the inequality of the magnetic flux density cannot be removed completely by this means. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The main object of the present invention is to minimize the above mentioned problem in the prior art, on the basis of the idea of equalizing the distribution of the magnetic flux density on the surface of the magnetic pole of the rotator by using, as a stator, such a structure in which yokes, having a desired pole number of magnetic poles, are attached to a permanent magnet having its polarity along its axis direction to remove the variance component in the output voltage of a non contacting speed detecting device of a DC generator type, which is generated by the inequality of the magnetic flux and to improve the precision of the speed detection. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a non contacting speed detecting device of a DC generator type, comprising a cylindrical rotater magnet having an alternating distribution of the N and S poles along the circumferential direction, a stator opposite to said rotator magnet, and stator windings wound in said stator, wherein a permanent magnetic, having its polarity along the axial direction, is used for said rotator magnet, a yoke member extending from the ends of said permanent magnet in its axial direction to the positions at which said yoke covers the lateral circumferential surface of said permanent magnet is formed, and said stator windings are arranged so that they face said yoke member. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS Figs. 1 A , B and C illustrate a nnwcontacting speed detecting device of a DC generator type of a prior art Fig. 2 illustrates various voltage waveforms in the speed detecting device in Fig. 1 Fig. 3 illustrates a non contacting speed detecting device of a DC generator type in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention Figs. 4 A , B and C illustrate the structure of the rotator used in the speed detecting device of Fig. 3 and Figs. 5 A and B illustrate the distribution of the magnetic flux density between the magnetic pole of the rotator and the stator core in the speed detecting device ofFig. 3. BEST MODE OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION A non contacting speed detecting device of a DC generator type, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, is illustrated in Fig. 3 and Figs. 4 A , B and C . In Fig. 3, a rotator 1 according to the present invention and a stator 2 in which windings W1 , W2 , W3 and W4 are wound, are illustrated. In Figs. 4 A , B and C , the structure of the rotator 1 of Fig. 3 is illustrated in detail. The rotator I consists of a permanent magnet ll, a yoke member 12 of the N pole side, a yoke member 13 of the S pole side and a rotation axis 14. The yoke members 12, 13 of the N and S pole sides have the same shapes, and each has a flat plane portion 15 contacting the magnetic pole surface of the permanent magnet 11, and a magnetic pole portion 16 vertical to the flat plane portion 15 and extending in a fashion so that it covers the lateral circumferential surface of the permanent magnet.This magnetic pole portion 16 is arranged to form the N poles and the S poles alternatively in the cylindrical surface coaxial to the permanent magnet 11. The speed detecting device of Fig. 3 differs from the speed detecing device of a prior art of Fig. 1 in the point that the magnet pole portion of the stator 1, which portion is opposite to the stator, is formed from the yoke member. In Figs. 5 A and B , the distribution of the magnetic flux density produced between the magnetic pole portion 16 formed from the yoke and the stator core 2 is illustrated. As illustrated in Fig. 5 A , the distribution of the magnetic flux density on the surface of the magnetic pole of the rotator is given from the end magnetic pole surface of the permanent magnet 11 through the magnetic material forming the yoke, and, therefore, it is equalized.In Fig. 5 B , the distribution of the magnetic flux density between the rotator l and the stator 2, which distribution is equalized according to the present invention, is illustrated. In accordance with the speed detecting device according to the present invention illustrated in Fig. 3, the voltage variance in the output waveform of each phase shown inFig. 2, in the case of the speed detecting device of a prior art, can be decreased remarkably. Therefore, the finally obtained output voltage of the speed detecting device has aDC waveform in which the variance component is extremely small for a constant rotating speed. Furthermore, in the above mentioned embodiment, the device, in which the number of the magnetic poles of the rotator is four, is described however, of course the number of the magnetic poles of the rotator may be two or six. According to the present invention, in the non contacting speed detecting device of a DC generator type, the distribution of the magnetic flux density between the magnetic pole portion of the rotator and the stator core can be equalized and the variance component of the output voltage can be removed, so that the precision of the speed detecting can be improved.
