# OPTICAL PRESSURE SENSOR WITH DIAPHRAGM

## Abstract
An optical pressure sensor comprises a resiliently flexible diaphragm and a rigid transparent cover plate mounted substantially parallel to the diaphragm and spaced therefrom by a collar so as to form a cavity between them. The opposing surfaces of the plate and diaphragm within the cavity are reflective, and form between them a Fabry Perot cavity, with the transparent cover plate enabling light to enter and escape from the cavity. The pressure to be sensed is applied to the diaphragm to cause it to flex and conse quently to vary the Fabry Perot interference pattern accord ing to changes in the pressure. The cavity is very thin, e.g. less than 1 micron between diaphragm and cover plate, and this can be formed cheaply by manufacturing the diaphragm from semi conductor material such as silicon, and etching it to form the cavity.
