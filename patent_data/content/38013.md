## Description
INJECTABLE OXYTETRACYCLINE COMPOSITIONS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to oxytetracycline injectable compositions having increased antibiotic content. 2. Description of the Prior Art Heretofore, preparations of oxytetracycline compositions suitable for injection have suffered from relatively high viscosities, poor stability and limited concentration of antibiotic. Such preparations have employed solvents such as propylene glycol, glycerol and polyethylene glycols as well as their mixtures with ethanol. High viscosities are particularly noticeable when injectable compositions containing polyhydric alcohols as solvents are used at low temperatures. Such high viscosities are often encountered when the compositions are used at the cool temperatures prevailing in barns, open feedlots or pastures. High viscosity compositions are obJectionable because aspiration of a viscous composition into a hypodermic syringe and subsequent injection of the composition are both difficult and slow.Further, high viscosities also increase the time required to inject a large herd of animals. Other solvents may cause tissue irritation which is particularly undesirable in an animal as they may cause localized concentration of the antibiotic in the tissue and render the affected area undesirable for human consumption. It is known according to United States Patent No.3,712,949 Greenbaum et al January 23, 1973, to prepare injectable oxytetracycline solutions utilizing glycerol formal as the solvent, a water soluble magnesium salt such as magnesium chloride hexahydrate, antioxidant, buffering agent and water.These compositions overcome the disadvantages specified above, i.e., they are characterized as having lower viscosities at low temperatures and having excellent stability as to color, antibiotic potency and physical state. However, the maximum antibiotic concentration which has been achieved is approximately 15 by weight of the total composition. It is desirable to prepare compositions having greater antibiotic concentration.This is of great importance because a composition having a greater antibiotic concentration permits reduction of the number of injections at any one time in large animals such as cattle.In the case of a large herd, this reduces both time and labor.Additionally, a reduced number of injection sites in an animal brings about less damage to the quality of the meat. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Oxytetracycline injectable compositions having increased antibiotic concentrations where glycerol formal is the solvent have been achieved by employing particular magnesium compounds, viz., magnesium oxide, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium carbonate, magnesium acetate and with oxytetracycline base only, magnesium chloride. These compositions can contain from, e.g., about 15 by weight to about 35 by weight oxytetracycline. These compositions permit a reduction in the number of injections at any one time in large animals. Further, they are characterized by their stability and low viscosities at low temperatures. Thus, fluid oxytetracycline compositions of enhanced antibiotic content suitable for injection over a wide range of temperatures, including low temperatures are provided for.Excellent stability of color, potency and physical state is achieved. Further, animals injected with these compositions are free of irritation at the site of the injection. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The relative proportions of the constituents can be varied widely. For example, the quantity of antibiotic such as oxytetracycline base or an acid addition salt thereof can vary from about 15.0 to about 35.0 parts by weight. The mole ratio of magnesium compound such as magnesium oxide to oxytetracycline base or acid addition salt can be varied from about 0.8 to about 1.2 moles of magnesium compound per mole of antibiotic. Preferably the mole ratio of magnesium compound to oxytetracycline base is about 1 1 while the mole ratio of magnesium compound to oxytetracycline hydrochloride is about 0.8 to 1. Lower ratios tend to give deeper color on standing while higher ratios tend to give both deeper color and cause precipitation on standing.With higher quantities of antibiotic, the quantity of magnesium compound should be maintained near its lower range, i.e., the mole ratio of magnesium compound to antibiotic should be about 0.8 to 1 to avoid higher concentrations of magnesium compound which may adversely affect the viscosity. The quantity of glycerol formal can vary from about 50 to about 95 parts by weight, the upper limit being regulated, of coursc, by the quantities of the other constituents. The quantity of water can be varied from about 10 to as much as about 45 parts by weight. Above 45 parts by weight of water, a turbid composition is formed. The presence of water is desirable to assist solution of the inorganics and to obtain an injectable composition which causes no visible tissue damage.Ethyl alcohol up to about 20 parts by weight can be substituted for part of the water or part of the glycerol formal in the composition to obtain a composition having even a lower viscosity. An effective amount of an antioxidant is added. Sufficient buffering agent is added to provide a composition having a pH of from about 6 to about 9.5. Glycerol formal, a condensation product of glycerol and formaldehyde is obtained as a mixture of 4 hydroxymethyl 1,3dioxolane and 5 hydroxy 1,3 dioxane. The mixture obtained as the product of the reaction, or a mixture made by fortifying the product of the reaction with one of the components, or the individual components can be used in the present invention. With respect to the magnesium compound, magnesium oxide, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium carbonate and magnesium acetate can be used. With oxytetracycline base only, magnesium chloride can be used. Magnesium oxide is preferred. Antioxidants are used in addition to manufacturing and storing the compositions of this invention in an inert atmosphere.The antioxidants assist in the stabilization of the color and potency of the compositions. Any antioxidant which is physiologically acceptable for use in a parenteral drug composition and which is compatible with oxytetracycline can be used in the present invention. Suitable anti oxi dants include sodium bisulfite, sodium metabisul fite, sodium formaldehydesulfoxylate and monothioglycerine.Generally from about 0.05 to about 5 parts by weight, preferably about 0.5 to about 2 parts by weight of antioxidant are used. An inert atmosphere such as nitrogen, helium or the like is not necessary for maintenance of potency, but aids considerably in the retention of a light colored composition on long storage. The compositions of the present invention are prepared by mixing an oxytetracycline antibiotic, in its free base form oxytetracycline base or as an acid addition salt, with the magnesium compound in water or the glycerol formal solvent. When water is employed, the glycerol formal solvent is then added to the aqueous solution in appropriate quantity. The pH of the composition is then adjusted to about 6.0 to about 9.5 with a buffering agent, e.g., physiologically acceptable bases such as sodium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, ammonia or physiologically acceptable lower aliphatic primary, secondary and tertiary amines having up to about six carbon atoms per group attached to the amino nitrogen atom. These amines include ethanolamine 2 aminoethanol , di ethyl amine, ethylamine, triethanolamine, diethanolamine, arginine, glucosamine or the like. The final pH of the composition is ordinarily not critical, however, best stability appears to reside with moderate pH value, i.e., between about 6.0 to about 9.5. Lower pH values cause too rapid decomposition of the antioxidant while too high a pH increases color formation.Also when the final pH is above about 9.5, physiological compatibility of the composition with the muscle tissue is decreased. A final pH slightly on the alkaline side is preferred in order to minimize local tissue irritation on parenteral administration. The most satisfactory range is from about 6.0 to about 9.5, preferably from about 7.5 to about 8.5. For injection, the finished composition must be sterile.That is, sterile components and sterile conditions of manufacture must be employed, or alternatively, the composition itself must be sterilized after manufacture such as by sterile filtration. Regarding the selection of the antibiotic, oxytetracycline free base or an acid addition salt of same such as oxytetracycline hydrochloride, oxytetracycline phosphate, oxytetracycline sulfate, oxytetracycline acetate or the like can be used. Where a light colored final product is desired, a light colored antibiotic should be used. For a fuller understanding of this invention, reference may be made to the following examples. These examples are merely to illustrate the invention and are not to be construed in a limiting sense. In the following examples, the glycerol formal contained 50 by weight of 4 hydroxymethyl l,3 dioxolane and 50 by weight of 5 hydroxy 1,3 dioxane. This material can be prepared as described in Example I of United States Patent No. 3,712,949. The oxytetracycline assay procedure utilized is described in 21 Code of Federal Regulations Part 446.265, page 541 and Part 446.267, page 542, April 1, 1978 revision. See portions entitledOxytetracycline injectable and references referred to therein. EXAMPLE I This example describes the preparation and stability of a 20 by weight oxytetracycline solution using glycerol formal as the solvent and a water soluble magnesium salt. Under nitrogen atmosphere, 57.5 grams oxytetracycline hydrochloride having a potency of 890 mcg mg were dissolved in a solution of 30 ml distilled water and 48 grams of glycerol formal.The resulting mixture was stirred until dispersed. Then 18.0 grams of reagent grade magnesium chloride hexahydrate was added. The mole ratio of magnesium to oxytetracycline was 0.8 to 1. Additional glycerol formal was added so that the total amount of glycerol formal used was 195 grams. The resulting mixture was warmed to 40 C and stirred until a clear solution was obtained about 1 1 4 hrs. . The resulting solution was cooled to about 20 250C and sufficient monoethanolamine was added over about 1 hour to adjust the pH to 8.3 8.4. Then a solution of 2.5 grams of sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate in 6 ml water was slowly added a slight yellow precipitate formed which dissolved after a few minutes and the resulting solution stirred until a constant pH of 8.3 8.4 was attained. Additional monoethanolamine was added to maintain the pH.About 2 hours were required during which time a total of 23.1 ml of monoethanolamine was added. The potency of the resulting solution was 210 mg oxytetracyclinetml. Its viscosity was 140 centipoise at 5 C and 90 centipoise at 210C. This solution was filtered through a 0.2 micron membrane filter. Stability studies were conducted. Samples on storage at 450C were stable only for 29 to 39 days while samples on storage at 37 C were stable only for 137 to 153 days. Formation of a yellow precipitate was taken as evidence of instability. EXAMPLE II This example describes the preparation and stability of a 20 by weight oxytetracycline base solution. Under nitrogen atmosphere, 2.0 grams of sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate were dissolved in 50 ml distilled water. Then 3.8 grams magnesium oxide were added, the mixture stirred and 46 grams oxytetracycline base having a potency of 920 mcg mg and 144 grams glycerol formal were added. The mole ratio of magnesium to oxytetracycline was 1 to 1. The resulting mixture was heated at 40 C for 20 minutes until a practically clear solution was obtained.It was cooled to 200C and the pH adjusted to 8.4 with 1.4 ml mono ethanol amine. About 2 hours was required for pH stabilization. The solution had a potency of 206 mg oxytetracycline ml. The solution containing 20.6 by weight oxytetracycline was filtered through a 0.2 micron membrane filter. Samples were stored at 370C for over 200 days. No yellow precipitation was observed. Additional preparations containing oxytetracycline base tabulated below, were prepared in a manner similar to the preparation of the composition of Example II.
