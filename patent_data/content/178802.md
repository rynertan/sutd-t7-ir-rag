# Compression and volume reduction treatment apparatus.

## Abstract
A compression and volume reduction treatment appar atus for solid wastes including a compression sleeve 4 for receiving therein a cylindrical vessel 20 filled with the solid wastes and a press ram 6 arranged above said compression sleeve 4 movably upward and downward for compressing at high pressure the cylindrical vessel in the compression sleeve 4 . According to the invention, the compression sleeve comprises an upper straight large diameter portion 7a a lower straight small diameter portion 7c and an intermediate tapered portion 7b , thereby compressing the cylindrical vessel 20 and reducing its volume in three dimensional directions by compressing the vessel radially inwardly at the tapered inner surface of the intermediate tapered portion 7b and compressing axially at the inner surface of the lower straight small diameter portion 7c when the cylindrical vessel in said upper straight large diameter portion 7a is urged by said press ram 6 in a uniaxial direction.
