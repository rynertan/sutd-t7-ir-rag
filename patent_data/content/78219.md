# AUTOMATIC DE SKEWING OF PIN ELECTRONICS INTERFACE CIRCUITS IN ELECTRONIC TEST EQUIPMENT

## Abstract
A plurality of pin electronics interface circuits are coupled to pins of an electronic device being tested to force stimuli signals representing logic states or other parameters on input pins of the device under test and monitor the resultant conditions on output pins of the device under test. Each pin electronics interface circuit includes a node to be coupled to a pin of the device under test, a driver connect able to the node by a first switch, a comparator connected to the mode by a second switch, and a third switch connecting the node to the node of a subsequent testing circuit. The skew of a signal supplied to or received from a pin of the device under test is determined by connecting the comparator associated with that pin to the driver of a reference interface circuit and measuring the skew of the comparator, and by connecting the driver associated with the node to comparator of a reference pin electronics interface circuit and measuring the skew associated with that driver. By daisy chaining subsequent pin electronics inter face circuits to preceding interface circuits, the skew of any interface circuit with respect to the preceding interface circuit may be determined, and related to the reference interface circuit.
