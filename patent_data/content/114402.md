## Description
METHOD OF DEVELOPING LIGHT SENSITIVE PLANOGRAPHIC PRINTING PLATES AND AUTOMATIC DEVELOPMENT APPARATUS The present invention relates to Åa method of developing light sensitive planographic printing plates hereinafter, referred to as PS plate and, in detail, to a method of developing which comprises supplying diluent to the developing solution to continually maintain the concentration of the developing solution at a value within a fixed range in order to compensate concentrating of the developing solution due to evaporation of water when carrying out development of a number of PS plates by means of an automatic development apparatus, by which uniform development can be carried out, and to an automatic development apparatus for the same. Generally, when developing PS plates by means of an automatic development apparatus, a supplement solution has been added based on the number of PS plates to be treated and the time required for treatment thereof so that the frequency of exchanging the developing solution accommodated in a development tank of the automatic development apparatus become small even if a large number of PS plates are treated. As the number ofPS plates to be treated is increased, effective components in the developing solution accommodated in the development tank are consumed. Accordingly, the developing ability deteriorates and, finally, the desired development can not be carried out. Therefore, in order to compensate for the above described problem, a supplement solution containing the above effective components is added.Further, when using an alkaline developing solution, since the developing solution absorbs carbonic acid gas in the air with the passage of time which deteriorates the developing ability of the developing solution. The above described supplement solution is added to compensate the deterioration.Such methods have been described in British PatentApplication 2046931A, Patent Cooperation Treaty Application WO82 C1086 and Japanese Patent Application OPI 5045 82, etc. The term OPI as used herein means a published unexamined Japanese Patent Application . However, if the development of PS plates is carried out with compensation as described above, the developing solution is concentrated by evaporation of water depending upon the temperature and humidity of the environment for development. Consequently, the ability of the solution to dissolve nonimage parts of the light sensitive layer deteriorates causing inferior development or components composing the light sensitive layer which are dissolved in the developing solution precipitate in the developing solution causing adhesion of sediments to the printing plates. Therefore, water is previously supplied by hand labor when sediments are formed or when formation of sediments is predicted from experience.However, when using such a method, excess water is often supplied to cause inferior development or the plate to which sediments adhere must be abandoned and produced all over again when water is added due to sediments which are formed. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide an improved method of developing PS plates, in which problems caused by evaporation of water in the developing solution are solved. More specifically, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide a method of developing PS plates capable of automatically compensating for the evaporation of water in the developing solution and an automatic development apparatus there for. As a result of many studies for the purpose of attaining the above object, the present inventors have found that the degree of evaporation of water in the developing solution can be determined by measuring the conductivity of the developing solution. Accordingly, the present invention relates to a method of developing light sensitive planographic printing plates which comprises developing a number of imagewise exposed light sensitive planographic printing plates with a developing solution composed of an inorganic ion containing aqueous solution by means of an automatic development apparatus.The method involves measuring the conductivity of the developing solution accommodated in a development tank of the automatic development apparatus, and adding a fixed amount of diluent to said developing solution to continually maintain the concentration of the developing solutidn at a value within a fixed range when the conductivity reaches a prescribed value which is higher than the initial value of conductivity. According to the present invention, since the concentration of the developing solution is automatically maintained at a value within a fixed range, stabilized development can be continually carried out without causing the problem of inferior development due to excess supplement of water or formation of sediments due to deficiency of water as prior methods which involved the manual addition of water. Further, since the troublesome work of supplementing the water is not necessary, work efficiency is improved. Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of an automatic development apparatus of the present invention Fig. 2 is a schematic diagram of another embodiment of a development apparatus of the present invention and Fig. 3 is a graph indicating the relationship between the conductivity of a developing solution and the surface area of PS plates treated while utilizing the method of applicants invention. In the present invention, in order to measure conductivity of the developing solution, conventionally used conductometers can be used. More specifically electrode type conductomers and electromagnetic induction type conductometers are advantageously used.It is particularly preferred that such conductometers have a temperature compensating circuit of 2 OC. One example of useful model of the conductometer comprises a or glass cell of CG 201 PL and a conductometer bodyCM 30ET produced by Toa Denpa Co. The position where the sensor of the conductometer is set may be suitably decided so long as the sensor is immersed in a developing solution to measure the conductivity of the developing solution when measurement is carried out. For example, a preferred position is in a developing solution circulating system and, particularly, a development tank, in the automatic development apparatus. Since the conductivity of the developing solution increases as the developing solution becomes more concentrated, if conductivity of the initial developing solution namely, fresh developing solution hereinafter, referred to as the first conductivity and conductivity of the concentrated fatigue developing solution at which sediment begin to form hereinafter, referred to as the second conductivity are known, it is possible to control the conductivity by adding a fixed amount of the diluent to the developing solution by means of an automatic measuring means such as an automatic measuring pump. The addition of the diluent is carried out when the conductivity reaches a prescribed value which is higher than the first conductivity but lower than the second conductivity. Generally, it is preferred that the above described prescribed value of conductivity is established within 1.3 times of the first conductivity.Further, the amount of the diluent to be supplemented is preferably enough to again provide the first conductivity.This amount can be determined by a simple test if the composition of the developing solution and the amount of it to be fed to the development tank are fixed. Figure 1 is a schematic section of a particularly preferred embodiment of the automatic development apparatus for carrying out the method of the present invention.In this automatic development apparatus, in the process of conveying PS plates in the direction of the arrow 2 by means of a conveying means such as feed rolls 1, etc., a developing solution 5 in a development tank 4 is sprayed onto the surface of the light sensitive layer of the PS plates from nozzles of a plurality of nozzle pipes 3 provided over the conveying passage by means of a pump 7 and, if necessary, the surface of the light sensitive layer is rubbed with a brush roll not shown in the drawing to carry out development processing. The used developing solution is recovered in a tank 4 after removal of insoluble substances by means of a filter 6.When the sensing means 8 detects insertion of the PS plates into the development apparatus, supply of the solution is started by operation of the pump 7, whereby the developing solution begins to spray from the nozzles.When the PS plates pass through the developing zone, spraying of the developing solution is stopped. The conductivity measurement means consists of a conductometer 9 and a sensor lC. The sensor lC is installed in a position which is immersed in the developing solution 5 in the tank 4. When the conductivity measured by the conductometer 9 increases to a prescribed value, an automatic measuring means 11 operates by an output signal, by which city water or diluent in a tank 12 is added in a fixed amount to the tank 4. The automatic measuring means 11 is set such that a fixed amount of diluent is added every time the operation signal is received from the conductometer and the addition of diluent is automatically stopped when addition of a fixed amount of diluent is finished.As the automatic measuring means, known means, for example, that which consists of a timer and a liquid sending pump, etc. can be used. Although the automatic development apparatus shown in Figure 1 is an apparatus which only developsPS plates, it is of course possible to use a PS plate processing apparatus having a development zone, and a cleaning zone, a water wash zone, a gum coating zone and or a drying zone, in which a diluting means for keeping the concentration of the developing solution within a fixed range as described above is incorporated into the development zone. It is further preferred to incorporate a known means for supplying a development supplement solution into these processing apparatus, because the effect of the present invention is further shown. Figure 2 is a section of a particularly preferred embodiment of the automatic development apparatus of the present invention, wherein such a supplying means is incorporated. In this apparatus, when PS plates are inserted in the direction of the arrow 20, a detecting means 21 operates and a developing solution 37 in a development tank 36 is sent to a plurality of nozzle pipe 28 provided over and under the conveying passage for the PS plates by means of a pump 34 to start spraying of the developing solution. The PS plates inserted between insertion rolls 22 are conveyed into a development zone through conveying rolls 23, 24, 30 and 32 while spraying of the developing solution.During the above process, the surface of the light sensitive layer is rubbed by brush rolls 29 and 31 to completely remove the nonimage parts of the light sensitive layer, and, finally, the developing solution adhering to the developedPS plates is squeezed out by squeeze rolls 25.Thereafter, they are sent to the water wash zone.The developing solution sprayed is recovered in a tank 36 after insoluble substances are removed by a filter 35.While the sensing means 21 detects the PS plates, an output signal is sent to an automatic measuring means 42, and a development supplement solution 43 is supplied to the developing solution in propertion to the time.Thus, the developing solution which is deteriorated by processing of PS plates is compensated. On the other hand, a conductivity measurement sensor 38 is set up in the developing solution 37 in the development tank 36, and the conductivity of the developing solution 37 is measured by a conductometer 39. When the measured value of the conductometer 39 increases to a prescribed value, an automatic measuring means 40 operates by the output signal of the conductometer and diluent 41 is added in a fixed amount to the developing solution. Thus, concentration of the developing solution by evaporation of water can be conpensated, and it becomes possible to carry out stabilized development over a longer period of time combined with compensation by addition of the development supplement solution. The plates passed through the development zone are then sent to a water wash zone, where they are sufficiently washed with water. In the water wash zone, insertion rolls 26 and squeeze rolls 27 are set up, and water is sprayed from nozzle pipes 33. The washing water is abandoned directly or it is once recovered in a tank and abandoned after having carried out the required treatment. In the method of development of the present invention, since the conductivity of the developing solution is measured to detect the concentration thereof, the developing solution used must be an inorganic ion containing aqueous solution and, preferably, an aqueous solution having 70 to 98 by weight of water and containing inorganic ions. Accordingly, the method of the present invention can be advantageously applied to PS plates capable of being developed with such a developing solution. Preferred examples of such PS plates includePS plates having a light sensitive layer composed of a diazo resin and a binder having acid groups such as carboxyl groups or alkali soluble groups.

The diluent used for the present invention comprises water or an aqueous solution containing at least one ooExwent of the components contained in the aqueous developing solution in an amount that the concentration of the component in the aqueous solution is lower than that in the aqueous developing solution. The preferable aqueous solution is obtained by a dilution of the aqueous solution with water 1 to 99 times by volume. When a large amount of inorganic ionic compounds is contained in the light sensitive layer of PS plates to which the method of the present invention is applied, inorganic ionic metals in the light sensitive layer of thePS plates are eluted into the developing solution.The increases the conductivity of the developing solution as the number of PS plates treated is increased and at the same time, increase of the conductivity caused by concentration due to evaporation of water in the developing solution occurs. The latter increase of conductivity can not be distinguished from the former increase of conductivity. In such a case, the increase of the conductivity of the developing solution when treating an increased number of PS plates treated is previously estimated. This estimate is fed to a computer so as to detect only increase of the conductivity caused by evaporation of water, by which the diluent supply is controlled such that a fixed amount of diluent is supplied when the conductivity increases to a prescribed value.Of course, it is advantageous that the light sensitive layer of the PS plates does not contain inorganic ionic metals, so that this troublesome operation will not be required. With the method of the present invention, it is preferred to use a method of supplying a development supplement solution together, as described in, for example, Japanese Patent Application OPI 5045 82. In the following, the present invention is illustrated in greater detail. Unless otherwise stated, means 8 by weight . The scope of the present invention is not limited to these examples. EXAMPLE 1 300 g of ethylene glycol monomethyl ether was heated to 1000C under a nitrogen stream, and a mixture composed of 70 g of 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate, 80 g of acrylonitrile, 130 g of benzyl methacrylate, 20 g of methacrylic acid and 1.2 g of benzoyl peroxide was added dropwise thereto over 2 hours. After 15 minutes from conclusion of addition, 300 g of ethylene glycol monomethyl ether and 0.3 g of benzoyl peroxide were added to the mixture to carry out reaction for 4 hours. After conclusion of the reaction, the mixture was diluted with methanol and poured into water to precipitate a copolymer, which was dried at 700C in vacuum. The acid value of the resulting 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate copolymer I was 40.2. A 1S aluminium plate having a thickness of 0.24 mm was degreased by immersing it in a 10 aqueous solution of sodium tertiary phosphate kept at 800C for 3 minutes. After being grained by means of a nylon brush, it was desmutted with a 3 aqueous solution of sodium aluminate at 60 C. The treated aluminium plate was subjected to anodic oxidation in 208 sulfuric acid at a current density of 2 A dm2 for 2 minutes and, thereafter, it was treated with a 25 aqueous solution of sodium silicate at 700C.for 1 minute. To the resulting aluminium plate, the following light sensitive solution was applied and dried at 1000C for 2 minutes to obtain a PS plate. 2 Hydroxyethyl methacrylate copolymer I 87 g 2 Methoxy 4 hydroxy 5 benzoylbenzene sulfonic acid salt of p diazodiphenyl amine paraformaldehyde condensate 10 g 50 aqueous solution of phosphorous acid 3 g Oil Blue 603 produced by Orient Kagaku Kogyo Co., triphenylmetane oil soluble dye 3 g 2 Methoxyethanol 600 g Methanol 600 g Ethylene dichloride 600 g The dry coating amount was 2.0 g m2.This PS plate was subjected to development processing in a nonexposed state with 1 Q of an alkaline aqueous developing solution having the following composition by dish development till 4 mê The value m2 shows a processing extent represented bysurface area m2 of the pnxessed PS plate based on 1 Q of developing solution. Sodium trinitrilotriacetate 0.5 g Sodium sulfite 3 g Benzyl alcohol 30 g Triethanolamine 20 g Monoethanolamine 5 g 35 Aqueous solution of sodium t butyl naphthalenesulfonate 30 g City water 922 ml In order to reduce the loss of the solution as much as possible when carrying out development, recovery of the solution was attempted by squeezing the surface and the back of the plate after development and, further, the development was rapidly carried out so as not to cause unnecessary evaporation of water in the developing solution in the development process. As a result, the amount of liquid which was 1 Q at the start was 0.98 R after conclusion or processing of 4 m2 t. Thus a processing solution in which evaporation of water hardly occurred was obtained. Conductivity of the development processing solution used for processing up to 4 m2 t, conductivities of the processing solution used for processing up to 4 m2 Q from which 10 and 20 of water were evaporated respectively, and conductivity of a fresh solution for comparison are shown in Table 1. At the same time, the degree of occurrence of development sediments caused by evaporation of water is shown. It is understood from Table 1 that a change of conductivity caused by the development processing is small as compared with a change of conductivity caused by evaporation of the liquid. Thus, the conductivity returned to the value before evaporation when water in an amount corresponding to the amount of evaporation was supplied to the processing solution. Table 1 Conductivity of Processing Solution and Occurrence of Development Sediments Conductivity of Occurrence of sedi processing solution ments in processing ms cm solution Processing m2 Q o 2 Q 2m2 t 4m2 Om2 Q 2m2 Q 4m2 t State of evaporation of developing solution 1 Amount of evapo ration is nearly 0 6.27 6.36 6.51 o 0 0 2 10 7.14 o 3 10 of water is added to 2 6.56 o 4 Amount of evapo 7.60 7.69 7.76 o x xx ration is 20 5 20 of water is 6.32 6.39 6.50 o o o added to 4 o Not occurred, x fairly occurred, xx heavily occurred In the processing solution concentrated by evaporation, sludges were formed as development sediments which adhered to the plates caused stains. When water was added in an amount corresponding to the amount of evaporation with stirring, the sludges dissolved and disappeared in the solution. From the above described result, a conductivity of 7.5 ms cm was used as a control value. Using an automatic development apparatus which had such a mechanism that a fixed amount of water is automatically supplied when the conductivity was above the above described value, a number of plates were subjected to development processing. Namely, 10 Q of the above described developing solution was put in the development tank of the automatic development apparatus shown in Figure 2, and a number of light sensitive plates were subjected to development processing. A glass cell for measuring conductivity type CG 201PL, produced by Toa Denpa Co. was attached to the development tank in the above described automatic development apparatus so that the conductivity of the developing solution in the development tank could be continually measured. A signal from the cell was sent to the body of the conductometer CM 30ET, produced byToa Denpa Co. which connected with a sensor switch.When the conductivity was above 7.5 ms cm, the switch was automatically operated to operate a supplying apparatus, by which 0.5 Q of water was added by a timer switch. Using this automatic development apparatus, the above described imagewise exposed PS plates having a size of 1003 mm x 800 mm and a thickness of 0.30 mm was processed at a rate of 20 m2 day to carry out running of 160 m2 per month at intervals of 3 4 days.The processing time per day was 5 hours. 270 m of a developing solution was supplied every 1 m2 in addition to the supply of water to prevent inferior development. Changes of conductivity during this process are shown in Figure 3. The conductivity increased as the number of days of processing increased. When the conductivity reached the control value, 0.5 Q of water was supplied. The water was supplied 6 times during 1 month to supply 3.0 Q of water per month. In the planographic printing plates obtained by the above described development processing, adhesion of development sediments was not observed and stains did not occur in printing and good printing ability was obtained. When the same development processing was carried out as described above except that water was not supplied for comparison, when 100 m2 of PS plates was processed, formation of development sediments was observed in the development tank, and the development sediments adhered to nonimage parts of the planographic printing plates. When printing was carried out practically using such plates, parts where the sediments adhered caused stains.
