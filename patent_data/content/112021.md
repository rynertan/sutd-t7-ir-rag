# A PASSIVE TARGET DETECTOR

## Abstract
Passive target detectors which employ infra red sensors may have difficulty in distinguishing between a cool target near the detector and a warmer one further away. A detector 1 detects a source of infra red radiation and if its size indicates that it may be of interest, a point source detector 3 operates a gate 5 to allow information regarding the direction of the target to be transmitted along line 7 to a store 8 and to a calculator 10. This information is combined at the calculator 10 with directional information from the previous scan stored at 8 to give the range of the source. The real intensity of the source is then calculated by circuit 13 from its range and apparent intensity. If the target is of interest an alarm is operated at 14.
