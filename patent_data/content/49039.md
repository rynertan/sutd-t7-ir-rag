# Data processing apparatus for processing sparse vectors.

## Abstract
Data processing apparatus has an arithmetic logic unit for processing at least one predetermined number said sparse vectors having corresponding order vectors. said sparse vectors having corresponding oder vectors. A register XO fetches order vector bits group by group until all order vector bits have been fetched, the number of bits in a group being equal to at least one predeter mined number of operands the arithmetic logic unit is capable of processing in tandem. A counter EP1 de velops a population count of the number of bits in a group of order vector bits indicative of the presence of operands in the corresponding sparse vector. Circuitry R2, R3, 10, SC1, A1, SC2, C1 simultaneously forwards first number of operands from said sparse vector, the a first number being equal to said population count, and a second number of operands of a preselected value, the second number being equal to said pretedermined number less said population count. An expansion net work E1 aligns and orders the forwarded operands according to the alignment and order of said group of order vector bits, the aligned and ordered operands being forwarded in tandem to the arithmetic logic unit.
