As used herein halo means fluoro, chloro or bromo lower implies alkyl groups having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Alkyl groups having more than 2 carbon atoms may be straight or branched. Preferred compounds are those in which AÚ is O, S,SO, NH or NZ and those in which AÚ is CH2 and R4 andR5 form O. Related prior art compounds disclosed in ourAustralian Patent No. 502,950 and Australian PatentApplication Nos. 42723 78 and 53362 79, are esters of acids of the general formula II EMI3.1 wherein A, R1 and R2 are essentially as defined above with one of the following alcohols 3 phenoxybenzyl alcohol 2 benzyl 4 furylmethanol a cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl alcohol 3,4 methylenedioxybenzyl alcohol a ethynyl 3 phenoxybenzyl alcohol a cyano 3 4 chlorophenoxy benzyl alcohol Bull and Searle in British patent 1,570,982 disclose inter alia insecticidal compounds of the structure using the notation of formula I EMI4.1 which are similar to the compounds of this invention where R4 R5 H, R6 H, CN or C CH, R7 3phenoxyphenyl or 3 4 methoxyphenoxy phenyl, A O orS and A is optionally substituted cycloalkyl.The major difference between these compounds and the present compounds is that they have a hydrogen or alkyl group attached to the group A instead of the substituted phenyl groupEMI4.2 The same British Patent also discloses compounds of the structure EMI4.3 which differ from the present compounds in that the cyclic group A is replaced by an isopropylmethylene group. Bull and Searle in U.S. patent 4,073,812 claim very similar compounds in which the A group is a methylene group substituted with a branched chain alkyl of 3 to 6 carbon atoms and R7 is 3 phenoxyphenyl or 2,3 fluorine substituted phenoxy phenyl. Japanese Patent application 56 154427 by MitsuiToatsu Kagaku K.K. covers compounds of formula V EMI5.1 where R6 H and R7 is 3 phenoxybenzyl, R is methyl or ethyl, and R1 is halogen or lower alkyl. These compounds are similar to the previously discussed compounds of Bull and Searle. In this case the cyclic group A has been replaced by C CH3 2 or C CH3 C2H5 to produce quite different compounds to those of the present application. U.S. Patent 4,218,468 to Mobil discloses ketone compounds where the A group of the present compounds is replaced by an isopropylmethylene group, R4, R5 together form a carbonyl oxygen and A1 is CH2, i.e., the compounds have the structure VI . EMI6.1 It will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art that the obvious structural differences between the prior art compounds formulae II to VI and those of the present invention formula I will give rise to significant differences in insecticidal properties, both in level of activity in individual insect species and in the spectrum of activity against various species. Such differences, however, are not readily predictable either as to magnitude or sign. The compounds of the invention formula I are optically active and can be resolved into their optical isomers by conventional methods. The invention thus includes the individual optical isomers of the compounds as well as the racemic forms. The compounds of formula I may be prepared by the conventional methods of synthetic organic chemistry. In general, the compounds are formed by reacting together compounds of the formulae VIII and IX EMI7.1 R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6 and A are as defined above and wherein P and Q are reactive atoms or groups, often referred to as leaving groups , selected so that on reaction they give rise to the desired group A1 or to another group which is convertible to that desired group. By way of illustration, the compounds I having the A1 groups listed below may be formed from the compounds VIII and IX having the indicated substituents P and O. The groups indicated for P andQ could equally well be interchanged i.e. P Br, Q OH to give A 0 .

The method used was as follows a The compounds were tested for activity against a dieldrin susceptible strain BLL which had been collected before dieldrin usage in the field. The test compound was applied in acetone solution, 0.5 ul dispensed wlth. a Drummond micropipette to the dorsum of the thorax of 2 3 day old females. Adult flies were fed on water and sugar only and maintained at 250C and 60 7 0 RH. The mortalities were determined after 24 hours. Moribund flies were regarded as dead. The LD50 values, in terms of concentration, were interpolated from the probit log dose relation using a computer program. The results given in Table 2 are expressed in terms of the Potency Index which is the ratioLD50 Permethrin LDsO Test Compound. b Potentiation The compound was also tested on the insects described above in conjunction with the potentiator piperonyl butoxide by pretreating each insect with 1 l of a 2 solution of the potentiator in acetone. The mortalities were counted at 48 hours after treatment and compared with acetone and acetone potentiator controls. The LD50 values were determined as described above and converted to Potency Index values. About the same levels of potentiation were obtained when piperonyl butoxide was replaced by an equal amount of Sesoxane . The results are shown in Table 2.EXAMPLE 20 Insecticidal activity against the German cockroach Blatella germanica was determined using the following method The compound under test was applied in acetone solution at a range of concentrations. 0.5 p1 was dispensed with a Drummond micropipette to the ventral thorax of adult cockroaches. The mortalities were determined after 48 hours. Moribund cockroaches were regarded as dead. The LD50 values in terms of concentration were determined by probit analysis of the mortality concentration data and converted toPotency Index values. The results are shown in Table 2. EXAMPLE 21 Insecticidal activity against the cotton pestHeliothis punctigera was determined using the following method The compound under test was applied in acetone solution at a range of concentrations. 0.5 iil was dispensed with a Drummond micropipette to the dorsal surface of 3rd instar larvae. Each larva was held in a separate container and was fed on spinach and maintained at 250C and 60 70 RH. The mortalities were determined after 48 hours. Moribund larvae were regarded as dead. The Lip50 values in terms of concentration were determined by a probit analysis of the mortality concentration data and converted toPotency Index values. The results are given in Table 2.
