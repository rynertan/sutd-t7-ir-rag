# System for the use of gas as secondary fuel in diesel engines.

## Abstract
A system for use of gas, like LPG, as secondary fuel in diesel engines is concerned. Normally aspirated and press ure charged engines with exhaust gas driven charging, with End speed or All speed governors or with common rail fuel injection systems are all included. A signal 24,25 proportional to the momentary effective fuel consumption controls the gas supply 20 to the engine 1 . A valve 19 in the gas supply 18 is connected to the control lever 16 of the engine governor 12 to allow gas supply only in a load range above approximately 25 and up to a maximum of approximately 40 of the full load total fuel consumption. In the lower load range uncomplete combustion of the gas thus is avoided, in the higher load range both detonation and overload are avoided and the opacity of the exhaust is improved. The consumption of liquid fuel is reduced and the exhaust gas composition is improved. An adjustable stop 28,29 limits the maximum injectable liquid fuel quantity when the engine is operated in the dual fuel mode. The system is designed to be both retrofittable to existing engines and fittable to factory new engines.
