# Water settable compositions, shaped article made thereof and process for the production of such an article.

## Abstract
A water settable composition suitable for the manufacture of non combustible cement based articles comprises a a major proportion, forming at least 50 by weight of the composition, of a mixture of non crystalline blast furnace slag and Portland cement, the Portland cement forming 10 to 33 by weight of the mixture, and b minor proportions of reinforcing vitreous fibres and web forming fibres. The composition when set with water matures to a product whose cement matrix is less erosive to the vitreous fibres than is a matrix in which Portland cement is the predominant cementitious constituent, and more stable to carbon dioxide than a matrix based on a supersulphated cement.

## Description
Water settable compositions and use thereofThis invention relates to water settable compositions suitable for the manufacture of non combustible cement based articles, especially articles reinforced with vitreous fibres.Non combustible cement based articles reinforced with glass or like fibres, such as fibres of mineral wool, can be made by first forming an aqueous slurry ofPortland cement containing the reinforcing vitreous fibres and web forming fibrous material usually cellulosic fibres . The aqueous slurry, which may contain small proportions of an agent e.g. china clay to modify the properties of the finished product, is then de watered and formed to the desired shape. During de watering, the escape of excessive amounts of cement from the slurry is prevented by the web forming fibre that is present. After shaping, the set product can be allowed to stand in air, or heated in steam, or otherwise treated to bring about curing of the cement.Maturing of the set Portland cement is accompanied by the release of lime in the cement matrix, and this leads to erosion of the reinforcing vitreous fibres. Although erosion may be slow, as with the well known alkali resistant zirconia glasses, it is accompanied by a decrease in the tensile strength of the vitreous fibres and hence, over the years, by a significant decrease in tensile strength of the composite of which they form part. In wet conditions, or in a damp atmosphere, erosion proceeds faster than in dry conditions. When the product is one which must maintain a high strength for example corrugated roofing, which is continually subject to wind loading the loss in strength consequent on erosion of the vitreous fibres results in a considerably shortened working life.The present invention involves the use of noncrystalline blast furnace slag as the predominant ingredient of the cement matrix of a vitreous fibre reinforced composite. Non crystalline blast furnace slag is the material obtained by finely dividing the vitreous phase produced by pouring into cold water molten blast furnace slag formed in the production of iron, and is ordinarily sold in ground form for admixture with Portland cement to improve the resistance of cement based concrete e.g. concrete building foundations to an acidic environment e.g. a site containing calcium sulphate .In order to reduce the erosion of glass fibre reinforcement in cement based composites, it has been proposed in UK Patent Specification No.1,521,030 to form the matrix material from a supersulphate cement, and in particular to use a dry cement mix which comprises at least 70 and preferably at least 75 by weight of non crystalline blast furnace slag and an amount of calcium sulphate activator forming 7 to 25 and preferably 10 to 15 by weight of the mix. The cement mix may also contain an alkaline accelerator, usually at a level of up to 5 by weight, e.g. about 2 by weight of lime or about 5 by weight of Portland cement. however, the long term stability of a matrix formed from such a cement mix is adversely affected by carbon dioxide, whether atmospheric or in the form of aqueous solution for carbon dioxide reacts with the ettringite crystal phase 3CaO.A1203.3CaS04.32H20 which forms a significant part of a supersulphate cement matrix, and such reaction weakens the matrix.We have now found that the strength of a cement vitreous fibre composite can be maintained longer at an acceptably high value by employing as the cement matrix a non crystalline blast furnace slag which incorporates a proportion of Portland cement forming from 10 to 33 by weight of the combined amount of slag and Portland cement.According to the invention, a water settable composition suitable for the manufacture of non combustible cement based articles comprises a a major proportion, forming at least 50 by weight of the composition, of a mixture of non crystalline blast furnace slag andPortland cement, the Portland cement forming from 10 to 33 by weight of the mixture, and b minor proportions of vitreous fibres and web forming fibres. The vitreous fibres are suitably present in an amount forming from 1 to 10 , preferably 2 to 5 , by weight of the composition. Other reinforcing fibres, whether organic e.g. polyamide or inorganic, may if desired also be included in the composition. The web forming fibres are suitably present in an amount forming from 1 to 10 , preferably 2 to 5 , by weight of the composition.The web forming fibres are preferably cellulosic, and are then suitably present in an amount of 1 to 5 by weight, but can for example be fibres of tricalcium silicate dihydrate, suitably of aspect ratio i.e.length thickness 25 1 or more, milled mineral wool fibres, or for pressure pipes, for example polyethylene or polypropylene fibres of the kind called synthetic pulp1. Preferably, the mixture a forms at least 75 by weight of the composition and preferably, the Portland cement forms from 10 to 258 by weight of the combined amount of slag and Portland cement.A small amount not more than 5 by weight of the composition, and suitably 1 to 3 by weight thereof of gypsum or other form of calcium sulphate can be included in order to improve the handling characteristics modulus of rupture, for example of the set but uncured composite. There can also be included an accelerator of the kind used to increase the rate at which ordinaryPortland cenent increases in strength after setting calcium chloride or calcium formate, at a level not greater than about 1 by weight of the composition, are examples of such accelerators.The composition of the invention may also contain small amounts of flocculants and pigments.The composition can be set with water, and cured, to produce shaped articles such as slabs, blocks, sheets, boards, roofing, and pipes following any of the common manufacturing processes, including the Hatschek process, the Mazza process, the Magnani process, processes using a simple press, and flow on board processes such as that described in German Specification DAS 1,220,247 andOLS 1,941,424. Preferably, in order to produce a composite with a cement matrix capable of attaining maximum or near maximum hardness in 2 3 days, instead of the 3 weeks period that is usual with a matrix of ordinary Portland cement, curing is carried out by immersing the set material in hot water 40 1000C or in an atmosphere saturated with water vapour at that temperature or higher e.g. 1OSOC. The compositions of the invention are particularly useful in the manufacture of cured products having a density in the range 1200 2250 kg m3.The invention is further illustrated by the followingExamples, which utilise a non crystalline blast furnace slag available as CEMSAVE Trade Mark from FrodinghamCement Co, Ltd, Scunthorpe, Humberside, England of the following properties Analysis t by weight SiO2, 35.0 A1203, 14.1 CaO, 38.3 MgO, 9.0 Fe203, 0.34 NnO, 0.50 Ti02, 0.45 St, 1.66 1.59 Surface area 300 400 m2 kgGlass count content of vitreous material not less than 95 as determined by light transmission test in tribromomethane Example 1A water settable composition can be made from the following ingredients by weightAlkali resistant glass fibre length 1.25cm filament diameter 14 ref15 mol Zt02 content 3.0Bleached kraft pulp Canadian standard freeness 1500 4.0Ordinary Portland cement 18.0Non crystalline blast furnace slag passing 200 pm sieve 75.0An aqueous slurry was prepared by throughly agitating the ingredients listed above with water temperature, 300C in a proportion water total solids 3 1, and the slurry thus formed was run appropriately diluted on aHatschek machine to produce flat sheets which were cured in air at ambient temperature for 3 weeks. The product had dry density 1600 kg m3, modulus of rupture 7.5 MPa, impact strength Charpy 5.3 kJ m2 and water absorption 24 by weight.In a procedure alternative to that of the above Example, the product stripped from the cylinder of the Hatschek machine was moulded into corrugated sheets to give material suitable for use as roofing. Individual glass fibres were carefully extracted from the cured product of the above Example after lapses of time and after treatments of the product as set out below, and the tensile strength of the extracted glass fibres was then measured and compared with that of fibres indentical except that they had been included in a product whose matrix was of ordinary Portland cement.Results were Tensile strength of fibres dN m2 From product From Hatschek of Example product having a matrix of ordinary Portland cement Time and Treatment 1.
