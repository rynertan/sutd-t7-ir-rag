# Radiation image storage panel.

## Abstract
A radiation image storage panel having a fluorescent layer which comprises a binder and a stimulable phosphor dispersed therein. Further, the panel is colored with a colorant so that the mean reflectance of the panel in the wavelength region of the stimulating rays of the stimulable phosphor is lower than the mean reflectance of the panel in the wavelength region of the light emitted by the stimulable phosphor upon stimulation thereof. The panel provides an image of high sharpness.
