## Description
Methyl 11s, 15R Dihydroxy 16,18 Methano 16 Methyl 9Oxoprost 13E En l Oate BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The compound of this invention is an analog of a natural prostaglandin. Natural prostaglandins are alicyclic compounds related to prostanoic acid, the structure of which is EMI1.1 By convention, the carbon atoms of I are numbered sequentially from the carboxylic carbon atom. An important stereochemical feature of I is the trans orientation of the sidechains C1 C7 and C13 C20, an orientation common to all prostaglandins. In I , as elsewhere in this specification, solid lines provide a reference plane such as the cyclopentyl ring or the bonds among C1 C7 and C13 C20 a dashed line indicates projection of a covalent bond below such reference plane alpha configuration while a wedged line represents direction above such plane beta configuration . These conventions apply to all structural formulae subsequently discussed in this specification.In some structures, however, a swung dash or serpentine line denotes orientation of a covalent bond either above or below the plane of reference indicated by theGreek letter xi in the nomenclature of such structures . Natural prostaglandins have the general structure,EMI2.1 in which L and M may be ethylene or cis vinylene radicals. Prostaglandins are characterized by the substituents on the cyclopentyl ring, the position of double bonds, if any, in the cyclopentyl ring and the number of double bonds in the side.chains. When the cyclopentyl ring is fully saturated, carbonyl substituted at the 9 position and hydroxyl substituted at the ll position an E class prostaglandin is represented PGE and when there is a single double bond in the sidechains, i.e., L and M in Formula 11 are ethylene, a type l prostaglandin is represented.The naturally occurring E class type l prostaglandin known as prostaglandin E1 or PGE1, is represented by the formula EMI3.1 Recent research indicates that certain prostaglandins, including PGE1 and analogs thereof, elicit biochemical and physiological effects in a variety of mammalian systems. In most mammalian respiratory tracts, PGE compounds affect in vitro preparations of tracheal smooth muscle. The human lung normally contains PGE compounds. Consequently, some cases of bronchial asthma may involve an imbalance in the production or metabolism of these compounds. 2. Prior Art Kurone et al., disclose in U.S. Patent 4,117,119 prostaglandins which are 15 cyclobutyl substituted. InClaim 1 of this patent, PGE1 compounds which can be l methyl esters with aEMI4.1 moiety attached to the 15 carbon atom where Rand R2 represent hydrogen atoms and R3 is alkyl of from 1 to 6 carbon atoms are disclosed. The compound claimed herein is closely related to those compounds disclosed by Kurone et al., but differs in that it contains an ethyl group in the 3 position of the cyclobutyl ring.Comparative tests between the 3 ethyl compound claimed herein and a compound of the type disclosed by Kurone et al., in which the 15 cyclobutyl ring is 3 unsubstituted indicate that the present compound is clinically superior as a bronchodilator for use in treating asthma patients because it exhibits significantly less irritancy to the tracheobronchial tract.

DETERMINATION OF PHARMACOLOGICAL ACTIVITY The compounds prepared as described in ExamplesI and II, i.e., TR 4681 and TR 4690, were tested to determine their activity in the relaxation of the human bronchial muscle relative to PGE1. The results of this test indicated a relative potency of TR 4681 to PGE1 of 1.33 and a relative potency of TR 4690 of 3.9 indicating that TR 4690 is approximately 3 times more potent thanTR 4681 as a bronchodilator. If potency as a bronchodilator were the only criterion upon which a drug of this type were judged, TR 4690 would be preferred. However, sincePGE1 was found to elicit sufficient cough and sore throat to preclude its clinical use, a second screen has been developed to determine the irritancy of prostaglandins to the tracheobronchial tract.This screen and the results observed in using it to test TR 4681 and TR 4690 are as follows MATERIALS PGE1 and the test compounds were dissolved in absolute ethanol to give stock solutions of 10 mg ml.These stock solutions and an ethanol vehicle were diluted using isotonic saline adjusted with phosphate buffer to pH 7.2. METHOD Specific pathogen free cats Category III of either sex from the Laboratory Animals Centre were used.Conscious cats 2 4 kg were restrained in an adjustablePerspex box with their heads protruding into a separatePerspex chamber with a seal around the neck. The respiratory pattern and rate of each cat was recorded via a Fleisch head pneumotachograph protruding into the top of the chamber. Sound was recorded by a microphone also protruding into the chamber. An aerosol of 1 8pm particle size was generated by a Monaghan 670 Ultrasonic nebulier and passed to the cat s face via an opening in the front of the chamber. Each cat was challenged initially for 10 minutes with an aerosol of isotonic saline adjusted with phosphate buffer to pli 7.2 plus the appropriate concentration of ethanol. This control challenge was followed by a 10 minute aerosol challenge of the test compound of PGE1 in the appropriate vehicle. This 10 minute challenge period is much greater than the brief period of inhalation likely to be used in man, but it does produce a larger number of coughs and enables us to determine the potency of the analogue relative toPGE1 in producing other unwanted side effects. Seven days were left between successive challenges to avoid the development of tolerance. Both drugs were tested in 5 cats using a wide range of concentrations of aerosol stock solutions. Each cat was observed during and up to 24 hours after the experiment for other side effects, e.g., sedation, diarrhea, and salivation. The results of these tests are set out in TablesI and II TABLE I SUMMARY OF TR 4681 RESULTSEMI22.1 tb onc SEP PGE SEP Cough SEP TR 4681 SEP Cough tb SEP Vg ml SEP AR SEP SEP SEP RR tb SEP 1.0 SEP SEP 9 SEP 2 SEP 0 SEP 0 tb SEP 10.0 SEP 34 SEP 3 SEP 3 SEP 0 tb SEP 50.0 SEP 45 SEP 69 SEP 41 SEP 16 tb SEP 100.0 SEP 38 SEP 33 SEP 41 SEP 11 tb SEP 500.0 SEP 47 SEP 58 SEP 67 SEP 14 tb t ARR percent change in respiratory rate TABLE IISUMMARY OF TR 4690 RESULTSEMI23.1 tb Conc SEP PGE1 SEP Cough SEP TR 4690 SEP Cough tb g ml SEP t SEP ARR SEP SEP ARR tb SEP 1.0 SEP 7 SEP 7 SEP 5 SEP 6 tb 10.0 SEP 20 SEP 10 SEP 11 SEP 5 tb SEP 50.0 SEP 10 SEP 11 SEP 26 SEP 15 tb 100.0 SEP 31 SEP 31 SEP 21 SEP 1 tb 500.0 SEP 42 SEP 63 SEP 39 SEP 33 tb ARR percent change in respiratory rate The data appearing in Tables I and II was compared with a computer program of relative potencies using a multiple assay of several test preparations against a standard and from this comparison it was determined that TR 4681 is approximately 50 times less potent an irritant than PGE1 and that TR 4690 is approximately 2 times less potent an irritant than PGE1 thus rendering TR 4681 twenty five times less potent an irritant to the tracheobronchial tract than TR 4690. From the results of the foregoing tests, one would unequivocally choose TR 4681 over TR 4690 for treatment of asthma patients because, while TR 4690 is approximately 3 times more potent than TR 4681 in relaxing human bronchial muscle, it is approximately 25 times more potent an irritant, which side effect would be highly adverse to the clinical use of TR 4690 in the treatment of asthma.
