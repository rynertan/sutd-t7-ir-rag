# Random access memory having active and standby modes.

## Abstract
In a memory selectively operable in an active and a standby mode, a first oscillation signal of a first frequency is produced by an oscillator 35a or 35b in the standby mode so as to reduce electric power consumption, instead of a second oscillation signal which is produced in the active mode and which has a second frequency higher than the first frequency. The first and the second oscillation signals are selectively supplied as a substrate voltage to a substrate 20 through a substrate voltage production circuit 36 . The oscillator may comprise a first circuit portion 46 to 48 for oscillating the second oscillation signal and a capacitor circuit 51 to 53 connected to the first circuit portion through a second circuit portion 56 to 58 in the standby mode so as to generate the second oscillation signal. Alternatively, the oscillator comprises first and second oscillator sections 61 and 67 for generating the first and the second oscillation signals and a selecting circuit 70 for selecting the first and the second oscillation signals. The second oscillation circuit is kept inactive during generation of the first oscillation signal.
