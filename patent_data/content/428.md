## Abstract
Method of, and apparatus for, making electrical harnesses. For making an electrical harness comprising an electrical connector to each of a plurality of terminals of which an individual insulated wire is connected, wires 202 are fed through a wire stripping station 6 with its stripper ram 50 raised, to a wire connecting station 4 , with wire lengthening blades 14 and wire stuffers 8 also raised. The wire stuffers 8 are first lowered to connect the wires 202 to terminals in a connector 200 at the connecting station 4 , the lengthening blades 14 are then lowered to form loops in the wires 202 to lengthen them differentially, the ram 50 is then lowered to sever the wires 202 , and the insulation thereof back from the ends of the wires. The blades 14 are finally further lowered to cause the severed ends 204 of the wires 202 to be stripped of insulation.
