# Treatment of whole blood for determination of red blood cell volumes.

## Abstract
Whole blood is treated to sphere, and optionally also fix, red blood cells in order to be able better to determine their volume and optionally number, by treating the blood with a an isotonic solution of a sphering agent, and b an isotonic solution of a sphering agent and a protein, to provide a weight ratio of protein to sphering agent of from 20 1 to 70 1, and a final concentration of sphering agent of from 2 to 10 mg 100 ml. In a modification of this procedure, use is made of the protein endogenous to the blood and step b is replaced by c treating the mixture from step a with an isotomic solution of a fixing agent such as glutaral dehyde. Reagent compositions comprising a sphering agent and a protein, for use in the above method, are also described.
