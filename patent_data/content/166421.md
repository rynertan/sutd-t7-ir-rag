## Description
The majority of plants obtain most or all of their nitrogen requirements from the soil. The adequate provision of nutrient nitrogen in soil for plant growth is one of the foremost agronomic problems. The nitrogen in the soil is found to occur primarily in three forms organic nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen, of which ammonium nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen are the primary forms utilized by plants. This nitrogen is absorbed by plants in solution from the soil in the form of ammonium ions and nitrate ions. The ammonium nitrogen in the soil occurs principally as colloidal bound nitrogen, only very small quantities of the ammonium form of soil nitrogen are lost from the feeding zone of the plants by leaching. The nitrate nitrogen in the soil is derived from the oxidation or nitrification of ammonium nitrogen by soil bacteria or by the addition of inorganic nitrate fertilizers such as ammonium nitrate, sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate and calcium nitrate. The inorganic nitrate compounds are readily soluble in water and the aqueous soil medium. When so dissolved, the nitrate nitrogen largely exists as the nitrate ion. The nitrogen contained in the nitrate, in contrast to ammonium nitrogen, is not adsorbed by the sorption carriers of the soil. A further discussion of the nature of this nitrogen problem in agriculture is set forth in U.S. Patent 3,135,594. Because of the anionic nature of this nitrate ion, nitrate nitrogen is rapidly leached by rainfall and irrigation and readily lost from the feeding zone of the plants. Further, the nitrate nitrogen is reduced by many soil bacteria to nitrogen gas. The latter process is known as denitrification and accounts for an additional loss of large quantities of nitrate nitrogen from the soil. The yearly loss from leaching and denitrification amounts to from 20 to 80 percent of the nitrate nitrogen found in the soil. To overcome the loss of ammonium nitrogen in the soil by nitrification, it is the practice to add to the soil a nitrification inhibitor. Representative nitrification inhibitors and their use can be found in U.S. Patents 3,135,594, 3,494,757 and 3,635,690 and British Patent 1,592,516. While the known inhibitors are effective in reducing nitrification, they, for the most part, have a major drawback in that they must be incorporated into the soil within a very short period of time, i.e., a few minutes to a few hours in order to avoid losses of the inhibitor to the air. This requirement for quick incorporation hinders and or restricts the use of nitrification inhibitors in agronomic practices where no till or minimum till is employed and in those areas where fertilizers are added and incorporation is delayed. The present invention is directed to methods and compositions useful in crop culture, and is particularly concerned with new agronomical practices and compositions for conserving nitrogen in soil by suppressing the nitrification of ammonium nitrogen therein. The active agent of the compositions employed in such methods is a pyrazole compound metal complex corresponding to the formula wherein M represents cobalt, copper, iron, manganese, tin, nickel, or zinc Y represents Cl₂, Br₂, NO₃ ₂ or SO₄ X represents hydrogen, bromo, chloro, fluoro or methyl and n represents the integer 2 or 4. The pyrazole compounds which are complexed are 3 methylpyrazole MP , 4 bromo 3 methylpyrazole MBP , 4 chloro 3 methylpyrazole MCP , 4 fluoro 3 methylpyrazole MFP and 3,4 dimethylpyrazole DMP . While the active pyrazoles of the present invention are normally depicted as shown in Formula I, it is believed that these compounds also exist in two additional isomeric forms. These isomers can be depicted as follows wherein M, Y, n and X are as above set forth and each p represents the integer 1, 2 or 3 with the sum of both p s being 2 or 4. It is further believed that the product obtained in the preparation of Formula I is a mixture of the three isomers and the depiction of either one of the isomers should be taken as the inclusion of all three isomers. The method of the present invention comprises applying to soil a composition which contains, as the active nitrification inhibitor, a pyrazole compound metal complex as defined above. A further feature of the method of the present invention is that the pyrazole compound metal complex in admixture with a reduced nitrogen fertilizer can be applied to the surface of soil where it can remain without incorporation into the soil for a period of up to 3 days or more, with at least about 70 percent of the pyrazole compound metal complex remaining. After administration subsequent irrigation or rainfall can distribute the pyrazole compound metal complex throughout the soil. The expression soil is employed herein in its broadest sense to be inclusive of all conventional soils , as defined in Webster s New International Dictionary, Second Edition, unabridged, published in 1937, G. C. Merriam Co., Springfield, Mass. Thus, the term refers to any substance or medium in which plants may take root and grow, and is intended to include not only earth, but also compost, manure, muck, sand, synthetic growth mediums such as vermiculite and pearlite and the like, adapted to support plant growth. By the practice of this invention, the nitrification of ammonium nitrogen in the soil to nitrate nitrogen is suppressed, thereby preventing the rapid loss of ammonium nitrogen from the soil. Furthermore, by proper distribution of the pyrazole compound this action of inhibiting the transformation of ammonium nitrogen to nitrate nitrogen is effective over a prolonged period of time. The ammonium nitrogen may arise from added ammonium nitrogen fertilizers or be formed in the soil by conversion of the organic nitrogen constituents found in soil or added thereto as components of organic fertilizers. The expression reduced nitrogen fertilizers as employed in the present specification and claims, is understood in the art, as embracing both inorganic and organic nitrogenous materials containing nitrogen in the reduced state. Examples of known reduced nitrogen fertilizers include anhydrous ammonia, aqueous ammonia, inorganic ammonium salts such as ammonium phosphates, ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate, ammonium salts of organic acids, urea, cyanamide, guanidine nitrate, dicyandiamide, thiourea, amines, urea form and other nitrogen containing organic chemical fertilizers as well as protein mixtures, animal tankages, green manure, fish products, crop residues, and other materials known to be sources of ammonium ions in soil. The application of an effective, nitrification inhibiting, dosage of the pyrazole compound metal complex to the soil is essential for the practice of the present invention. In general, good results are obtained when the pyrazole compound metal complex is applied in the amount of from 0.05 to 5.0 pounds per acre .056 to 5.6 kgs hectare of soil. The preferred amounts to be employed are dependent upon the particular situation. Thus, in determining the amount to be employed, consideration is necessary as to the soil pH, soil organic matter, temperature, soil type and time of application. By dispersing very large dosages to soil, a prolonged inhibition of nitrification can be obtained over a period of many months. The concentration of the active pyrazole compound metal complex is eventually reduced to a minimum by decomposition in the soil. In one method for carrying out the present invention, the pyrazole compound is distributed to the soil in a broadcast application such as by spraying, dusting, distributing in irrigation water, etc. In such application, the pyrazole compound metal complex is supplied in amounts of from 0.05 to 5.0 pounds per acre .056 to 5.6 kgs hectare . In another method for carrying out the present invention, the pyrazole compound metal complex is administered to the soil in a band or row application. In such application, administration is made with or without carrier in amounts sufficient to supply to the soil a concentration of the pyrazole compound metal complex which can be as high as 5.0 pounds per acre 5.6 kgs hectare or more. In one embodiment of the present invention, the pyrazole compound metal complex is distributed throughout the soil prior to seeding or transplanting the desired crop plant. In another embodiment, the soil in the root zone of growing plants is treated with the pyrazole compound metal complex in an amount effective to inhibit nitrification but sublethal to plant growth. In a further embodiment, the pyrazole compound metal complex can be applied following harvest or after fallowing to prevent rapid loss Of ammonium nitrogen and to build up the ammonium nitrogen formed by conversion of organic nitrogen compounds. Such practice conserves the soil nitrogen for the following growing season. In such application the upper limit is primarily an economic consideration. Additionally, the pyrazole compound metal complex can be applied prior to, subsequent to or simultaneous with the application of a reduced nitrogen fertilizer. Such practice prevents the rapid loss of the ammonium nitrogen added as fertilizer and the ammonium nitrogen formed from the organic reduced nitrogen in fertilizers by the action of soil bacteria. In a preferred procedure, the pyrazole compound metal complex is employed as a solid or liquid composition comprising a reduced nitrogen fertilizer in intimate admixture with the pyrazole compound metal complex. As indicated above, the present method embraces distributing the pyrazole compound metal complex as a constituent in liquid or solid fertilizer compositions. In such practice, the pyrazole compound metal complex is admixed with the fertilizer and such mixture can be modified with one or more additaments or soil treating adjuvants to formulate the mixtures employing conventional procedures as wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates, dust, granular formulations or oil or water flowable emulsion concentrates. In preparing such formulations, the pyrazole compound metal complex fertilizer mixture is extended with adjuvants including water, petroleum distillates or other liquid carriers, surface active dispersing agents and inert finely divided solids. Preferred adjuvants are surface active dispersing agents and inert finely divided solids these adjuvants cooperate with the pyrazole compound metal complex so as to facilitate the practice of the present invention and to obtain an improved result. These compositions may also contain as additional adjuvants one or more other biologically active materials such as herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, miticides, bactericides, nematocides, and the like. The only requirement for these added materials is that they be both chemically and biologically compatible with the pyrazole compound metal complex. The concentration of the pyrazole compound metal complex in the compositions can vary considerably provided the required nitrification inhibition dosage of the effective agent is supplied to the soil. In general, good results are obtained when employing liquid compositions containing from 0.05 to 5.0 percent by weight of the pyrazole compound metal complex in some operations, however, compositions containing amounts of pyrazole compound metal compound in excess of 5.0 percent, such as from 5 to 98 percent of the active pyrazole compound metal complex by weight of composition are conveniently employed, as for example, in row or band application. With solids, good results are usually obtained with compositions containing from 0.05 to 5.0 percent or more by weight of pyrazole compound metal complex. In some circumstances, such as in high intensity application, however, it is preferred to employ solid compositions containing as much as from 2 to 98 percent or more by weight of the pyrazole compound metal complex. Liquid or solid compositions in which the pyrazole compound metal complex is present in higher concentration can be utilized as such or can be employed as concentrate compositions to be diluted to prepare actual treating compositions. The liquid compositions containing active agent, i.e., the pyrazole compound metal complex, can be prepared by admixing one or more of the active agents with water or an organic solvent, with or without the aid of a suitable surface active dispersing agent or emulsifying agent, and admixing this mixture in an aqueous solution of the desired fertilizer. Suitable organic solvents include acetone, diisobutylketone, methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, diethyl ether, toluene, methylene chloride, chlorobenzene and the petroleum distillates. The preferred organic solvents are those which are of such volatility that they leave little permanent residue in the soil. Dispersing and emulsifying agents which can be employed in liquid compositions include, for example, condensation products of alkylene oxides with phenols and organic acids, alkyl aryl sulfonates, polyoxyalkylene derivatives of sorbitan esters, complex ether alcohols and mahogany soaps. The surface active agents are generally employed in the amount of from 1 to 20 percent by weight of the pyrazole compound metal complex. Solid compositions containing the active agent can be prepared by admixing the pyrazole compound metal complex, dispersed in a volatile organic solvent, with the solid fertilizer. In another procedure, the solid fertilizer can be mechanically ground with a dispersion of the pyrazole compound metal complex in a solvent and the resulting mixture prilled, granulated or otherwise formed into the desired form. After coating the solvent is vaporized off. In an additional procedure, solid granules of the fertilized are coated with a sticking agent such as mineral oil and then coated with a mixture of the pyrazole compound metal complex and a solid carrier. These solid compositions may, if desired, also contain an alkyl aryl sulfonate or other surface active dispersing agent. Depending upon the proportions of ingredients, these compositions can be employed without further modification or be considered as concentrates and subsequently further diluted with conventional solid carriers such as talc, chalk, gypsum, clays, or the like to obtain the desired treating composition. Furthermore, such concentrate compositions can be dispersed in water with or without added dispersing agent or agents to prepare aqueous soil treating compositions. In these fertilizer compositions, it is desirable that the pyrazole compound metal complex be present in an amount of at least about 0.05 percent by weight based on the weight of the nitrogen present in the fertilizer as reduced nitrogen and can be present in amounts as high as 95 percent by weight of the reduced nitrogen in the fertilizer. Generally, amounts of pyrazole compound metal complex in excess of about 5.0 percent yield no greater advantage and are therefore seldom used. Thus, when a fertilizer composition contains both reduced nitrogen and other forms of nitrogen, such as in the case of ammonium nitrate fertilizer compositions, the amount of pyrazole compound metal complex is based on the weight of nitrogen present in the ammonium component. The pyrazole compound metal complexes employed in the practice of the present invention are for the most part all known compounds. The few complexes which may not be specifically known can be prepared by the same procedures taught for the remaining complexes. The complexes can easily be prepared by adding, at room temperature although higher temperatures can be employed the appropriate pyrazole in a solvent such as water, an alcohol or a mixture thereof to a stirring solution of the appropriate metal salt in a solvent such as water, an alcohol or a mixture thereof. The reactants are present in the ratio of from 2 to 4 mols or more of the pyrazole per mol of the metal salt, depending on the specific complex wanted. The desired complex forms as a solid precipitate which may occur immediately or upon removal of some or all of the solvent. The complex is usually recovered by filtration and dried. The following examples further illustrate the invention. Bis 3 methylpyrazole copper II chloride complex A solution was prepared by dissolving 6.21 grams g of copper II chloride dihydrate in 10 milliliters ml of deionized water. To this solution was added at once 6 grams of 3 methylpyrazole in 10 ml of deionized water. A turquoise solid precipitated immediately with some small pockets of dark blue solids. The slurry was stirred for fifteen minutes and only the turquoise solid was observed. The solid was removed from the water by filtration and dried. The resulting product was recovered in a yield of 8.1 g 74 percent of theoretical and melted at 188 190 C, with decomposition. Upon analysis, this product was found to have carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen contents of 32.10, 3.90 and 19.00 percent, respectively, as compared with the theoretical contents 32.17, 4.04 and 18.76 percent, respectively, as calculated for the above named compound. Tetra 3 methylpyrazole copper II chloride complex To a stirring solution of 3.9 g of copper II chloride dihydrate in 75 ml of deionized water was added a solution of 7.5 g of 3 methylpyrazole in 50 ml of deionized water. A deep blue solution resulted. Dark blue crystals formed as the water was removed. The crystals were collected and carefully dried Tetra 3 methylpyrazole copper II sulfate complex To a stirring solution of 3.8 g of copper II sulfate pentahydrate in 50 ml of water methanol mixture 40 percent water was added at once a solution of 5 g of 3 methylpyrazole in 150 ml of methanol. A deep blue solution resulted immediately. After a minute or so, a precipitate formed. Another 100 ml of methanol were added and the slurry heated until all of the precipitate had dissolved. The solution was cooled slightly and all but 60 ml of the solvent was removed By following the preparative procedures as outlined above and in Examples I, II and III, and employing the appropriate pyrazole and metal ions, the complexes of Formula I are prepared. Typical complexes include Aqueous ammonium fertilizer compositions containing a predetermined amount of nitrogen, by weight, and a sufficient amount of one of the hereinafter set forth pyrazole compound metal complexes, dispersed in a predetermined amount of water, to give compositions containing 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 parts by weight of the complex per million parts of soil were prepared by dispersing the pyrazole compound metal complex in a predetermined amount of an aqueous ammonium sulfate solution. The compositions so prepared were employed to treat a sandy loam soil having a pH of 7.2 and containing 1.2 percent organic matter. The soil was in containers which were sealed to prevent loss of moisture. In the treating operation, the amount of the composition employed was sufficient to bring the soil moisture to 1 3 bar and the soil was thoroughly mixed to insure a substantially uniform distribution of the composition throughout the soil. In a check operation, other soils similarly prepared were fertilized with a similar aqueous fertilizer composition containing the same amount of water but no pyrazole compound metal complex. The composition was applied in an amount to supply the same concentration of nitrogen to the soil as the treating composition containing the complex. All of the containers were then sealed and maintained at about 80 F 27 C for a period of 14 days. At the end of the 14 day period, the extent of nitrification of the added ammonium sulfate fertilizer was determined by analysis for nitrate nitrogen. The analysis was carried out using a nitrate specific electrode similar to that described by Keeney and Nelson on page 663 of Methods of Soil Analysis, Part 2 Second Edition , ASA, Inc., Madison, Wisconsin, 1982. The results of this analysis and the complexes tested are set forth below in Table I. Aqueous ammonium fertilizer compositions containing a predetermined amount of nitrogen, by weight, and a sufficient amount of one of the hereinafter set forth pyrazole compound metal complexes, dispersed in a predetermined amount of water, to give compositions containing 0.032, 0.063, 0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 parts by weight of the pyrazole complex per million parts of soil were prepared by dispersing the pyrazole compound metal complex in a predetermined amount of an aqueous ammonium sulfate solution. The compositions so prepared were employed to treat a sandy loam soil having a pH of 7.2 and containing 1.2 percent organic matter. The soil was in containers which were sealed to prevent loss of moisture. In the treating operation, the amount of the composition employed was sufficient to bring the soil moisture to 1 3 bar and the soil was thoroughly mixed to insure a substantially uniform distribution of the composition throughout the soil. In a check operation, other soils similarly prepared were fertilized with a similar aqueous fertilizer composition containing the same amount of water but no pyrazole compound metal complex. The composition was applied in an amount to supply the same concentration of nitrogen to the soil as the treating composition containing the complex. All of the containers were then sealed and maintained at about 80 F 27 C for a period of 14 days. At the end of the 14 day period, the extent of nitrification of the added ammonium sulfate fertilizer determined by analyses for nitrate nitrogen. The analysis was carried out in accordance with the same procedure as described in Example I. The results of this analysis and the complexes tested are set forth below in Table II. Aqueous ammonium fertilizer compositions containing a predetermined amount of nitrogen, by weight, and a sufficient amount of one of 3 methylpyrazole ₂ CuCl₂ complex and 3 methylpyrazole ₂ ZnCl₂ complex, dispersed in a predetermined amount of water, to give compositions containing 0.016, 0.03, 0.06, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 parts by weight of the pyrazole complex per million parts of the soil were prepared by dispersing the pyrazole compound metal complex in a predetermined amount of an aqueous ammonium sulfate solution. The compositions so prepared were employed to treat a sandy loam soil having a pH of 7.2 and containing 1.2 percent organic matter. The soil was in containers which were sealed to prevent loss of moisture. In the treating operation, the amount of the composition employed was sufficient to bring the soil moisture to 1 3 bar and the soil thoroughly mixed to insure a substantially uniform distribution of the composition throughout the soil. In a check operation, other soils similarly prepared were fertilized with a similar aqueous fertilizer composition containing the same amount of water but no pyrazole compound metal complex. The composition was applied in an amount to supply the same concentration of nitrogen to the soil as the treating composition containing the complex. All of the containers were then sealed and maintained at about 80 F 27 C for a period of 20 days. At the end of the 20 day period, the extent of nitrification of the added ammonium sulfate fertilizer was determined by analyses for nitrate nitrogen. The analysis was carried out in accordance with the same procedure as described in Example I. The results of this analysis and the complexes tested are set forth below in Table III. Aqueous ammonium fertilizer compositions containing a predetermined amount of nitrogen, by weight, and a sufficient amount of one of 3,4 dimethylpyrazole ₂ FeCl₂ complex or 3,4 dimethylpyrazole ₄ FeCl₂ complex, dispersed in a predetermined amount of water, to give compositions containing 0.63, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 parts by weight of the pyrazole complex per million parts of soil were prepared by dispersing the complex in an aqueous ammonium sulfate solution. The compositions so prepared were employed to treat a sandy loam soil having a pH of 7.2 and containing 1.2 percent organic matter. The soil was in containers which were sealed to prevent loss of moisture. In the treating operation, the amount of the composition employed was sufficient to bring the soil moisture to 1 3 bar and the soil thoroughly mixed to insure a substantially uniform distribution of the composition throughout the soil. In a check operation, other soils similarly prepared were fertilized with a similar aqueous fertilizer composition containing the same amount of acetone but no complex. The composition was applied in an amount to supply the same concentration of nitrogen to the soil as the treating composition containing the complex. All of the containers were then sealed and maintained at about 70 F 21 C for a period of 4 weeks. At the end of both a two week period and a 4 week period, the extent of nitrification of the added ammonium sulfate fertilizer was determined by analysis for nitrate nitrogen. The analysis was carried out in accordance with the same procedure as described in Example I. The results of this analysis is set forth below in Table IV. A study was conducted to determine the stability of various pyrazole compound metal complexes when coated onto urea prills. One hundred gram portions of urea prills were placed into 600 milliliter ml beakers and rotated at a 45 angle. Various pyrazole compound metal complexes, dispersed in methylene chloride or a mixture of methylene chloride and methanol depending on the complex for ease in application , was sprayed as a fine mist onto the rotating urea prills. After the prill was evenly coated, the solvent was evaporated off with the aid of a hot air gun. The coated prills contained about 0.25 percent of the pyrazole in the complex by weight based on the weight of nitrogen in the urea. Since each formulated complex contained a different percentage of the base pyrazole compound, the dispersions contained a sufficient amount of the complex so that 138 milligrams mg of the pyrazole compound was present on 100 grams of the urea prills. Two gram samples of each urea complex formulation were weighed into 1 inch diameter x 1 4 inch deep 2.54 cm diameter x .635 cm deep round steel planchetts and placed into a 25 C 1 C circulating oven. Identical 2 gram samples were also placed into a 35 C 1 C circulating oven. Samples from each oven were removed for assay each week for four weeks to determine the amount of pyrazole complex loss from the surface of the urea. This loss was determined employing standard high pressure liquid chromatograph analysis techniques. The results of this analysis and the complexes employed are set forth below in Table V.
