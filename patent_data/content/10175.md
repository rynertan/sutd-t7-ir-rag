# Method for servicing a steam generator.

## Abstract
A servicing machine 3 for a steam generator 1 is accu rately set up in the generator channel head 11 with a pivoted arm 63 mounted for rotation in a plane parallel to the tubesheet 9 . The angular position of the arm 63 , the lon gitudinal position of a carriage 81 mounted on the arm and the vertical position of a platform 87 on the carriage are remotely controlled to manoeuvre a probe 1 or 5 used in mapping the precise location of the thousands of holes 23 in the tubesheet. Various operations are then performed at each precise hole location by tools carried by the arm mounted carriage to prepare for installation of new tubing. The opera tion of a pair of remotely controlled pivoted arms 63 , one on each side of the channel head divider plate 15 , is coordinated to automatically position the ends of U shaped tubes in cor responding holes in the tubesheet on opposite sides of the divider plate and to secure the same in place.
