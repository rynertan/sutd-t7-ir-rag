# Separation of aniline and p fluoroaniline.

## Abstract
A process is disclosed for the separation of p fluoroan iline from a mixture, containing aniline and p fluoroaniline, by contacting the mixture with a mineral acid in the presence of an organic solvent. The corresponding salt of p fluoro aniline is insoluble and can easily be isolated by conventional means such as filtration. If desired, the iso lated salt can be converted to p fluoroaniline by reaction with a base.
