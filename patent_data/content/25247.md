# Anti contamination diaphragm for an electron beam apparatus.

## Abstract
In order to reduce object contamin ation during the examin ation or machining of the object in an electron beam apparatus, an anti contamin ation diaphragm is provided in place of the customary diaphragm. The anti contamin ation diaphgragm has a central aperture 30 which corresponds to a customary diaphragm aperture, and a concentric annular aperture 31 for transmitting a non paraxial hollow beam 45 which irradiates a ring around the paraxial focus on the object. The conical hollow anti contamination beam forms a barrier 47 against contaminating residual gas molecules, notably hydrocarbon molecules.
