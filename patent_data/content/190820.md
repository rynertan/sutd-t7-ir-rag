# ZIRCONIUM THIN FILM METAL CONDUCTOR SYSTEMS

## Abstract
A thin film metal conductor system using a zirconium adhesion layer is disclosed. The system is formed by first p lating a layer of zirconium over a substrate material and any electrical components, such as resistors,which are fixed on the substrate. A conductive layer is then deposited over those portions of the zirconium layer which are to provide conductive pathways. The resulting unit is thermally treated in an oxidizing environment, such as air, to oxidize the exposed portions of the zirconium layer and tehreby form reginos of zirconium oxide. The zirconium oxide is noncon ductive and protects underlying composnents from moisture and physical abrasion.
