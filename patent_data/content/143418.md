# RESET MECHANISM

## Abstract
The mechanism resets to zero the visible digits on a series of cylinders aligned on an axle, without inserting any friction when the reset is not active. Pressing a knob dis places the axle axially causing a series of teeth stamped on the cylinder axle to penetrate in respective housings in the cylinders. Turning the knob then causes each tooth to en gage a corresponding projection within the housing driving the cylinders towards zero simultaneously, the cylinders act against their coupling pinions to push the pinion axle away and free the cylinders. To avoid free rotation of the pi nions so that they may properly reengage the cylinders when returning to their normal position urged by springs, the pinions are jammed by windows cut out in the cover when pushed away. Releasing the knob permits another spring to exit the teeth from their housing, so that the cylin ders may yet again be driven via the pinions.
