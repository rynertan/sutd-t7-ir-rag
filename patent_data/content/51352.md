# REMOVING WASTE HEAT

## Abstract
An improved waste heat disposal process is characte rised primarily by splitting the total cooling load between two or more open looped evaporative cooling circuits P and S , staging the circuits in series such that each successive circuit has a greater dissolved solids carrying capacity than the preceding one, using the brine blown down from a preceding circuit as the coolant circulated within the next succeeding one, and treating only the blowdown from one circuit to the relatively greater extent necessary to accommo date the increased solids carrying capacity of the next. The invention also includes the feature of essentially staging the heat load by dividing same into two or more parts and handling the different parts by separate and distinct evapora tive cooling loops.
