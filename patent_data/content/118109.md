## Description
TRITHIOPHOSPHONATE INSECTICIDES, PARTICULARLY FOR USE IN SOIL This invention relates to a series of trithiophosphonate insecticides, as defined below, which have been found particularly suitable for use in soil. Various important crop plants are subject to attack by the larval stage of soil insects of a number of types, particularly of the genusDiabrotica, for example, the Northern corn rootworm Diabrotica longicornis and the Western corn rootworm Diabrotica virqifera , which feed specifically on the root system of corn plants, the Southern corn rootw3rm or spotted cucumber beetle Diabrotica undecimpunctata which attacks peanut pods and also roots of corn plants, and the banded cucumber beetle Diabrotica balteata , which attacks root systems of sweet potatoes. The larval stage of these insects attack or eat all of the smaller roots of infested plants and form tunnels in the larger roots, thereby weakening or destroying them.Corn plants growing in fields infested with the Northern or Western corn rootworm exhibit poor growth and may die, and the larger plants may fall down during cr after a heavy rainfall or strong wind because of their weakened root system. Additionally, these soil insects seriously affect the quality of the harvested crop, particularly in the case of corn. A number of other crops may have their root systems attacked by other insects in the soil. These insects include various maggots, wireworms, larvae of various weevils or beetles, and white grubs. In the past, the most common insecticides used to control such pests were halogenated hydrocarbons, particularly chlorinated hydrocarbons such as aldrin, dieldrin, heptachlor, DDT and BHC benzene hexachloride .These compounds, however, leave heavy and persistent residues in the soil, which may remain in the soil for many years. Additionally, these halogenated hydrocarbons tend to be concentrated and stored for great lengths of time in animal tissues and thus in the food chains of animals or humans, and therefore have been either banned completely in developed countries or limited to a few specific uses. While a number of organophosphorus derivatives have been found to be effective for control of insects on plant foliage, many such com pounds have not been found satisfactory for use in the soil. A series of organophosphorus compounds which have been found to be satisfactory soil insecticides is disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,896,219 and 4,191,757 and is represented by the formulaEMI2.1 in which R and R are each alkyl groups having from 1 4 carbon atoms, one of the radicals X and Y is sulfur, and the other is oxygen or sulfur, and n is 0 or 1. A particularly effective compound of this series isS chloromethyl d iethylpho sphoroth ioloth ionate, which has the formulaEMI2.2 and is commercially sold under the generic name chlormephos. Description of the Invention This invention comprises a series of organcphosphorus insecticides, compositions containing them, and methods of controlling insects, particularly methods of controlling insects of the genus Diabrotica in soil. he insecticides of this invention have the formulaEMI2.3 in wich RÚ is methyl or ethyl and Rê is an alpha branched or ss branched alkyl group containing from 3 8 carbon atoms. As will be shown below, these compounds emcnstrate exceptionally good control of Diabrotica larvae in soil at low levels of application, and maintain residual activity for exceptionally long times, namely for six weeks or greater. Additionally, these compounds exhibit general control of a number of other insects. Preferred compounds of this invention are those in which R1 is ethyl and R2 is an 2 branched alkyl group having from 3 8 carbon atoms. Such alkyl groups include isopropyl, sec. butyl, tert. butyl, 3methylbutyl, 2,2 dimethylpropyl neopentyl and 1,1 imethylpropyl tert. amyl . The term insects as used herein refers to the broad and commonly understood usage rather than to those creatures which in the strict biological sense are classified as insects, and includes, in addition to those belonging to the class Insecta, some classes of arthropods, such as spiders, mites, ticks, and the like, particularly mites. The compounds of the present invention may be prepared according to the twa sLep reaction scheme shown below EMI3.1 tb SEP 555 SEP S tb 1. SEP R1 SEP li SEP SEP 2 SEP R2SH SEP 2 tb r, SEP F R1 SEP t SEP 2 SEP R2SH SEP 2 SEP R1P SHbase tb SEP base SEP SR2 tb EMI3.2 In the first step the appropriate alkyl thionophosphine sulfide is reacted with two equivalents of a desired mercaptan in the presence of a base to produce a thioic acid salt. The starting material sulfide may be obtained for instance by the procedure described in P. E. Newallis,Journal of Organic Chemistry, 1962, Vol. 27, p. 3829. Reaction 1 is advantageously carried out at a temperature of from about 40 C. to about 150 C., in an organic solvent in the presence of a base, particularly a tertiary amine. Suitable solvents include aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene or toluene, ethers such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran, chlorinated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride or chloroform and ketones such as acetone. Suitable tertiary amines include triethylamine, dimethyl aniline, diethyl aniline and pyridine. Inorganic bases such as sodium hdyroxide could be used in this step, but are less desirable as the resulting salts are less soluble in the solvents utilized. As the reaction is exothermic, the base is preferably added dropwise when operating on the laboratory scale. The second reaction is conducted in an organic solvent such as that utilized in the first reaction, at a temperature of from about 20 C.to about 130 C. The bromochloromethane reagent is utilized in excess in this step. The desired product may be recovered by removing precipitated salts, followed by evaporating or distilling off the solvent.

EXAMPLE 2 Preparation of S 1 , 1 Dimethylpropyl S Chloromethyl Ethylthiophosphonodithioate Compound No. 4 a. A solution was prepared containing 7.2 g 0.03 mole ethylthionophosphine sulfide and 6.3 g 0.06 mole 1,1 dimethylpropyl mercaptan in 100 ml tetrahydrofuran. To the solution was added dropwise 8.1 ml 0.06 mole triethylamine. The mixture was stirred at room temperature 1 2 hour, then refluxed for 20 minutes at 67 C. After cooling, the solvent was removed under vacuum leaving 15.5 g 80 of theoretical yield of the intermediate product S tertiary amyl ester of ethylthiophosphonodithioic acid triethylamine salt, a viscous liquid. b. A solution was prepared containing 8.2 g 0.03 mole of the triethylamine salt prepared in step a and 16.2 g 0.13 mole bromo chloromethane in 100 ml tetrahydrofuran. The mixture was refluxed for 18 hours at 67 C. The solvent was removed in vacuo and the residue taken up in ether. The ether solution was washed twice with water, dried over magnesium sulfate and reduced under vacuum.

Examples of liquid forms are emulsions, solutions, suspensions, flowables, emulsifiable concentrates and pastes. Such compositions may contain, in addition to the active compound or compounds, various carriers or diluents surface active agents wetting agents, dispersing agents and or emulsifying agents solvents water, or organic solvents such as aromatic solvents or chlorinated aliphatic solvents adhesives thickeners binders anti foaming agents and other substances as mentioned herein.Solid carriers or diluents included in such compositions or formulations may include, for example, ground natural minerals such as kaolins, alumina, calcium carbonate, silica, kieselguhr, clays, etc. ground synthetic minerals such as various silicates and aluminosilicates and ground vegetable products such as bark, cornmeal, sawdust, cellulose powder and the like. To manufacture solid compositions, the active substances are mixed with solid carriers or diluents such as those mentioned above and the mixture is ground to the appropriate size. Granules can be mantlrac tured by dissolving an active compound in an organic solvent and trying the mixture, for example, by atomization, onto an absorptive granulated inert material, such as silica. Adhesives may be utilized to assist in the incorporation of the compound onto the solid particles. Wettable powders and pastes are obtained by mixing and grinding an active compound with one or more dispersing agents and or solid car riers or diluents. Also included may be wetting agents and or dispersing agents, for example, lignins, methyl cellulose, naphthalenesulfonic acid derivatives, fatty alcohol sulfates and various types of akali and alka line earth metal salts of fatty acids. Emulsifiable concentrates are generally obtained by dissolving the active compound in an organic solvent, for example, butanol, cycle hexanone, xylenes, or higher boiling aromatic hydrocarbons. Tb obtain suspensions or emulsions in water, wetting agents may also be added. Flowables are prepared by mixing an active compound with one or more dispersing agents and or solid additives, and a liquid which may be water or an organic solvent in which the active compound is relatively insoluble, and grinding the mixture. Both liquid and solid compositions may be in microcapsule or encapsulated form, to permit release of the enclosed active compound at a controlled rate over a period of time. Liquid compositions of this type contain encapsulated droplets of approxiwately 1 50 microns in diameter, including the active compound and optionally a solvent. The e encapsulating material is an inert porous inubrane of a polymeric material. Solid encapsulated compositions generally take the form of granules, in which the liquid containing the active component is trapped in the pores of the granular support by a porous polymeric membrane through which the active ingredient may migrate at a controlled rate, or which membrane breaks down at a controlled rate to permit escape of the active ingredient. Atypical encapsulating materials include natural and synthetic rubbers, cellulosic materials, styrene butadiene copolymers, polyacrylonitriles, polyacrylates, polyamides, polyisocyanates, polyurethanes, mixed copolymers of the foregoing and starch xanthates. It is possible to use highly concentrated liquid compositions containing up to about 958 by weight of the active compound, or even the 100 active compound alone, when applying the compound in the form of a finely divided liquid by use of various atomizeing equipment, for example by airplane spraying techniques. For other purposes, however, the various types of compositions which can be utilized for these compounds will contain varying amounts of the compound according to the type of composition and the intended use. In general, insecticidal compositions may contain from 5 to 95 of the active compound, more preferably from 10 to 85 . Some typical com positions will contain an active compound as follows wettable powders 25 to 80 active compound oil suspensions, emulsions, solutions, flowables, and emulsifiable concentrates 5 to 85 active compound aqueous suspensions 20 to 50 active compound dusts and powders 5 to 20 active compound granules and pellets 5 to 20 active compound. In addition to the active compound and the various agents utilized in preparing compositions and formulations mentioned, such compo sitions may also contain one or more other active compounds of the tpye mentioned herein as well as other active pesticidal agents, such as herbicides, fungicides, insecticides, acaricides, nematocides, bactericides, and plant growth regulators. Such compounds may also contain soil disinfectants or fumigants and may further contain fertilizers, thus making it possible to provide multi purpose ooCpositions containing one or more of the active compounds described herein as well as, optionally, other pesticides and also fertilizers, all intended and formulated for use at th same locus. Control of insect pests is accomplished by applying a composi tion containing an insecticidally effective amount of an active compound as described herein to the insect, to a locus at which insecticidal control is desired, or to food sources including seeds on which the insects feed. For use in the last mentioned manner it is preferable to utilize a compound which is nct volatile.Thus, control may be achieved by direct application of the active cort pounds to the insects and indirectly by application of the compounds to a locus to be protected such as crop lands, grass ranges and forests , to a source of food for insects or to other insect habitats for exa w le, breeding or swarming areas . The rates of application of the active compound, and the concentration applied, will vary according to whether the compound or composition is being directly applied to the insect or indirectly, to a locus, food or habitat. In the latter case the rate of the application, depending on the nature of the insect or insects to he controlled, and the plant environment, will generally vary from about 0.01 to about 100 pounds per acre about 0.112 to about 112 kg ha . It should be noted that the active compound need not be insecticidally active per se to effect insect control. me purposes of this invention are fully served if such compounds are rendered active by external influences, such as light or heat, or by some physiological action which occurs when the compound is ingested into the body of the insect. Compositions containing one or more of the active compounds described, in an insecticidally effective amount, may be applied to the plant, locus or insect habitat in any conventional manner. When used in connection with crop or other plant protection, application may be made in a preventive i.e. before infestation or eradicative manner i.e., after infestation . Thus, Powders and various liquid compositions containing the active compound can be applied by the use of power dusters, boom and hand sprayers and spray dusters, or applied from airplanes as dusts or sprays. When applied in the latter method they may be effective in very low dosages. Compositions including active compounds may also be applied by addition to irrigation waters supplied to the field to be treated. This method of application permits penetration of the compounds into the soil as the water is absorbed therein. Compositions including active compounds may additionally be used to protect plant seeds fran being attacked by soil borne insect pests after planting and during germination, by applying the composition to the seeds as a seed dressing. This is performed generally by mixing the seeds with an active composition in either liquid or solid form preferably liquid in a suitable mixing apparatus. Liquid compositions for this purpose may contain an adhesive or sticking agent, such as methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, etc., to assist the composition in adhering to the seed.If a solid composition is utilized for this purpose, an adhesive agent may be sprayed on the seeds during or after mixing. For use as a soil insecticide, the active compound, or oomposi tions containing it, may be mixed with the soil in any conventional manner, before, during or after planting of the plant seeds. Liquid compositions may be applied by spraying onto the surface or by incorporation in irrigation or sprayed water. Solid or liquid compositions containing an active compound may be incorporated into the soil prior to or during planting by discing, plowing or other mixing operations, in order to locate the active ingredient below the surface of the soil so as to be most effective in controlling undesirable larvae.
