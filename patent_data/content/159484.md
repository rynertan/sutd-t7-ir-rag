# Adjustable radius apparatus for calibrating ultrasonic transducer array.

## Abstract
Calibration apparatus 10 for an ultrasonic transducer array 85 which is used to inspect inaccessible concave surfaces in a hazardous environment such as inside a nu clear steam generator the transducer array 85 is cali brated by moving it along an arcuate calibration test mem ber 11 and includes four upright posts 23 interconnected by a rectangular carriage 30 which is slidably movable vertically along the posts 23 and which has a horizontal pivot shaft 36 . An attachment rod 56 dependent from the shaft 36 through a mounting block 51 carries a coupling joint at its lower end for mounting the transducer array 85 . A reversible gearmotor 42 drives the pivot shaft 36 in an oscillating motion. Backlash in the gear train is reduced by a bias weight 102 .
