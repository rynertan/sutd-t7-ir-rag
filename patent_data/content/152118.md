## Abstract
A rechargeable emergency battery charging device for starter motor storage batteries. The device includes a plurality of rechargeable nickel cadmium or sealed lead cells. A first circuit is provided which couples the cells in series for charging the storage battery and a second circuit couples the cells in parallel so they may be recharged from the storage battery. A switch means interconnects the two circuits. Charging and recharging current flow is regulated, and circuit functions are indicated by light emitting diodes and by a galvanometer. The device is provided with connecting means to couple it to an automobile storage battery via the cigarette lighter or directly to the battery terminals. A further connector is provided for recharging the device from an AC source.
