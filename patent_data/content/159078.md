# Current take off device intended to be connected to a voltage rail.

## Abstract
A current collector device intended to be connected to a voltage rail comprising a bottom part 1 with two parallel side walls 2, 3 on whose inner side longitudinally extending ribs 4, 5, 6, 7 are provided, while at least two mutually insulated current conductors 11, 9, 10 are present on the bottom part, this current collector device comprising a housing of synthetic material which is provided with project ing contact members 14, 15 and is shaped so that it can be pressed into the rail, an electrical connection being estab lished between the contact members and the current con ductors, while the housing is detachably secured to the side walls of the voltage rail by means of edges 20, 21 cooperating with the ribs 4 and 5 in the rail, the housing accommodating a carriage 13 which carries the contact members and is slidable between a decoupling position, in which the housing can be pressed into the rail, and a coupling position, in which the housing is locked in the rail in the pressed in state.
