## Description
SYRINGE WITH INNER CONE This invention relates to a syringe comprising a syringe body and a sealable cone member with an axial bore as adapter onto which a needle can be affixed. Syringes of this type are used in medicine especially for injecting liquids or gases and for puncture.Usually such syringes consist of a graduated clear glass cylinder having a terminal, centrally or eccentrically disposed, standardized positive cone as needle neck, e.g. a Luer Iock neck or record neck, together with a piston section.This needle neck forms the adapter between the syringe body and the injecting needle to be affixed onto the body.In conventional syringes this adapter is made up of several parts, namely of a cone member incorporating a flange, which is pushed onto the tapered connector end of the syringe body with a ring gasket in between, and of a sleeve by means of which the cone member is locked and sealed at the connector end of the syringe body. Because so many individual parts are required, such syringes are expensive to manufacture, both with regard to the manufacture of the individual parts and the assembly of the syringe. This proves to be a particular drawback in the case of the disposable syringes which are in common use.By contrast, the object of the present invention is to provide a relatively inexpensive syringe, the prime consideration in accomplishing this object being to reduce the number of individual parts required for the adapter.The solution provided by the present invention is distinguished by the fact that at its base the cone member exhibits a flange to ensure that it sits snugly against the inner wall of the syringe body. The adapter of the invention is made up of a single part, thus simplifying both the manufacture and the assembly of the syringe. Thanks to the fact that the flange fits against the inner wall of the syringe body, i.e. the cone member is pushed from the interior of the syringe body out through the connector end until the flange rests against the inner wall of the syringe body, on the one hand an effective seal is achieved between the cone member and the syringe body, and on the other hand the flange at the same time forms an abutment so that the cone member cannot be pressed or drawn outward out of the connector end of the syringe body.Rather, thanks to a corresponding action of pressure or suction, the snug location of the flange against the inner wall of the syringe body and hence the seal is further improved.In the syringe of this invention an annular collar can additionally be provided on the outer circumference of the cone member, so that after being pushed through the connector end of the syringe body the cone member is locked tight between the collar and the flange. Furthermore, an additional sealing collar may advantageously be provided on the outer circumference of the cone member between the collar and the flange, said sealing collar improving the seal between the connector end of the syringe body and the cone member.As in the conventional cone members, a sealing cap may advantageously also be pushed onto the cone member of the syringe of this invention, so that the syringe is kept sealed during storage and the cone member protected.The sealing cap and the cone member are advantageously dimensioned such that the two components can be affixed together before being introduced into the syringe, and so assembled can be pushed together from inside the syringe out into the bore of the connector end. In this way assembly is simplified.The inner surface of the sealing cap can be of a conical design, this surface being complementary to the outer surface of the cone member, so that a very tight seal can be achieved when locked. This sealing action can be further improved by providing the sealing cap with an axial sealing pin which can be introduced into the axial bore of the cone member, the point where this pin connects with the sealing cap preferably being complementarily conical to the inner cone at the free end of the cone member. In order to prevent the sealing cap from undesirably becoming detached, an interlocking arrestor connection can be provided on this sealing cap and on the cone member, said arrestor connection preferably exhibiting a collar ring on the cone member and a corresponding annular groove on the sealing cap, or vice versa.In accordance with the present invention the bore of the cone member can further be sealed by means of a diaphragm, for instance in the region of the flange, for example to prevent the inside of the syringe from becoming contaminated during storage. Before the syringe is used this diaphragm is then torn or punctured, for example by the pressure released when the syringe piston is atuated, or else by pressing onto it with the sealing cap pin or some other needle shaped object.The invention is explained in greater detail below with reference to the attached drawing. Figs. 1 to 3 each show a longitudinal section of part of two embodiments of the syringe of this invention with a syringe body 1, cone member 4 and sealing cap 9.The essentially cylindrical syringe body 1 exhibits a tapered connector end 2 for a needle or for the cap. Like the syringe body 1, this connector end 2 is also of an essentially cylindrical or conical design and in the embodiment illustrated is coaxial to the syringe body. The common axis is designated by reference numeral 3. Alternatively, however, the connector end 2, for example, can also be disposed eccentrically to the syringe body 1. The cone member 4 with its axial bore 5 exhibits a flange 6 at its base, which is so designed that it sits tightly against the inner wall of the syringe body 1 when introduced into the cone member 4 via the connector end 2 ofthe syringe body 1.Thus it is advantageous if the cone member and especially the flange 6 are manufactured from plastically and or elastically ductile material so as to ensure that the flange sits tightly against the syringe body.In the embodiment shown in Fig. 1 an annular collar 7 is formed on the outer circumference of the cone member 4 to permit the cone member 4 to lock between the collar 7 and the flange 6. To this end, the distance between the collar 7 and the flange 6 is selected according to the length of the connector end 2.The outer surface of the cone member 4 between the collar 7 and the flange 6 can be of a conical or cylindrical design, though a slight conical tapering toward the collar 7 is preferable in order to make it easier to introduce the cone member 4 into the connector end 2. To increase the sealing action between the cone member 4 and the syringe body 1, an additional annular sealing collar 8 can be disposed on the outer circumference of the cone member 4 between the collar 7 and the flange 6, which sealing collar, as shown in Fig. 2, advantageously engages in a corresponding inner annular groove 15 in the connector end 2 so as to improve location of the cone member 4 in the syringe body.The free end of the cone member 4 adjoining the collar 7 is designed to be essentially complementary to the neck surface of the needle to be affixed, for example corresponding to the Luer Lock neck or record neck already mentioned.The sealing cap 9, which is designed to seal off the syringe before use, is correspondingly shaped. This sealing cap 9 exhibits a central sealing pin 10 which extends down coaxially into the axial bore of the cone member 4 when the sealing cap 9 is affixed. Since the cone member 4 exhibits an inner cone 12 at its free end, the neck 11 of the sealing pin 10 on the sealing cap 9 is designed to be complementarily conical to the inner cone 12 so that the sealing action is increased when the sealing cap 9 is affixed. In order to prevent the sealing cap 9 from being unintentionally pulled off the cone member 4, an arrestor connection is provided between the two, this arrestor connection for example being formed by a collar ring 13 on the outer circumference of the cone member 4 and by a corresponding annular groove 14 in the sealing cap 9. The shape of the axial bore 5, for example cylindrical or conical, can be selected according to the desired conditions in the case of the embodiment depicted the axial bore 5 is conical and tapers toward the free end of the cone member 4.The cone member 4 of the invention, which serves as an adapter between the syringe body 1 and the needle not illustrated , is designed as a single part, with the result that both the manufacture and the assembly of the syringe are simplified. The cone member 4 and or the sealing cap 9 can be manufactured quite easily from plastic, e.g. a hard rubber such as polyethylene, for instance by injection molding.In the embodiment as shown in Fig. 1 the syringe is assembled by first of all pushing the cone member 4 from inside into the bore of the connector end 2 of the syringe body 1, and then the sealing cap 9 is affixed from outside. Conversely, in the embodiment shown in Fig. 2 the cone member 4 and the sealing cap 9 can first be assembled and then together pushed from inside the syringe body 1 out into the bore of the connector end 2.Furthermore, according to Figs. 2 and 3 a diaphragm 16, 16 for sealing off the axial bore 5 of the cone member 4 can be designed in one piece with the latter this diaphragm ensures that the syringe body is completely sealed hermetically until used. Only when the syringe is used is the diaphragm torn due to the application of pressure by actuating the syringe piston not illustrated or else punctured using a needle or the sealing pin 10 of the sealing cap 9. The diaphragm can be made from the same material as the cone member 4 or from different material, for example in the form of a onepiece plastic injection molded part. If the diaphragm is disposed in the region of the flange 6, the sealing pin 10 of the sealing cap 9, or even the latter itself, can be dispensed with e.g. as in Fig. 3 , since thanks to the diaphragm 16, 16 injection substances from the syringe body 1 are prevented from penetrating into the axial bore 5 of the cone member 4, which could otherwise lead to blockages there.In the embodiment according to Fig. 3, unlike in Fig. 2, the sealing cap 9 is shortened at its lower end and the collar 7 enlarged such that, as in the embodiment of Fig. 1, it helpsto seal the cone member 4 at the connector end 2. It is therefore possible in this case to dispense with the arrestor connection 8, 15, if so desired.
