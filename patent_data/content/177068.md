## Abstract
A device including means 1 responsive to sound in a given frequency band and a sound emitted actuated in response to the frequency responsive means to emit sound for a predetermined time.

## Claims
Claims. 1. A device including means 1 responsive to sound in a given frequency band and a sound emitted actuated in response to the frequency responsive means to emit sound for a predetermined time. 2. A device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the device is responsive to a frequency in the region of 1,800 Hz. 3. A device as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the responsive means 1 is a piezo electric device. 4. A device as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, wherein the sound emitter 1 emits a series of beeps . 5. A device as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, wherein the device is part of a key ring or pendant.

## Description
Warning devices .This invention relates to warning devices, to give an audible signal when suitably actuated.The invention provides a device including means responsive to sound in a given frequency band and a sound emitted actuated in response to the frequency responsive means to emit sound for a predetermined time.A preferred frequency band for the responsive device is 1600 Hz to 2200 Hz. In one example of the invention, the device is part of a key ring. If the key ring is lost a whistle at a frequency to which the responsive means reacts will set of sound emission to guide the owner to his lost keys.Referring to the drawing, which is a circuit diagram illustrating one example of the invention, a piezo electric microphone device 1 responds to sound of frequency about 1,800 Hz say within an octave bracketing this frequency .Response by the device 1 actuates a control logic circuit 2, and thence, by way of filter 3 and amplifier 4 an audio generator 5.The logic circuit 2 also controls a timer 6, and this controls the audio generator through amplifier 7, filter 8 and memory and programming control circuit 9. A responsive by the device 1 causes generation of intermittent sound of lower frequency, for a given period, e.g. like a conventional beeper . A further whistle of the appropriate frequency will cause the generator to repeat the performance.A power supply not shown is included, in the form of batteries producing 3 volts D.C. Elements of the circuit can be part of an integrated circuit or chip . A lost set of keys may be located in the dark, or in a hidden corner, by this device. The device may be used to locate any item that could go missing, for example animals or children. A child could wear the device as a pendant.The device may generate a sequence of musical notes, but not in the frequency band to which the piezo electric microphone responds.The device may be combined with a watch, say having aL.C.D. display.
