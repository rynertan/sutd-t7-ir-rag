# High pressure mercury vapour discharge lamp.

## Abstract
High pressure mercury vapour discharge lamp contain ing rare gas, mercury, sodium halide and at least one halide of at least one of the rare earth metals Ce, Pr, Nd and Lu. The lamp is suitable for a nominal power in the range from 10 to 2000 W. The molar ratio of rare earth metal to sodium, Ln Na, has a value from 1 20 to 1 1 and the quantity of mercury, A, has a value from 2 to 100 mg cmÂ³. Ln Na and A have in these ranges a low value for lamps having a high value of the power, and higher values according as the nominal power of the lamp has a lower value.
