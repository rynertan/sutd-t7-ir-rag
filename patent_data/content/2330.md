## Description
DOUBLE GLAZING This invention relates to double glazing assemblies and a method of providing such double glazing. In particular this invention is concerned with the double glazing of existing in situ single glazed installations.The intention of this invention is to provide a simple yet effective method of double glazing an existing in situ single glazed installation. The invention is also suitable for utilisation as and in prefabricating double glazed assemblies in readiness for subsequent installation. In a further embodiment the invention provides for an in situ fabricated double glazed assembly.Many methods and means of double glazing are known all involving, as I understand, some form of brackets or subframe to retain the additional glazing element. Additionally, several of these methods and means describe at least the partial evacuation of the cavity created between the glazing of elements, the desirability of this being known. The most relevant prior art of which I am aware are the following American Patents. 579,460 2,117,581 1,336,211 2,1 7,001 1,495,948 2,436,037 1,915,098 2,925,862Not one of these known methods or means teaches either reliance on the suction so created to provide the sqle supporting and retaining means for the additional glazing element or utilisation of such phenomenon as a method of assembly or construction such characteristics being the essence of this invention. By this, this invention eliminates the need and thus cost of additional support brackets or sub frames, and, as hereinafter described, this enables the simple and ready assembly of the additional glazing element particularly to an existing in situ installation.According to a first aspect of this invention there is provided a double glazed window assembly characterised in that a continuous impervious resilient sealing strip is interposed between peripheral face sections of adjacent faces of substantially parallel disposal primary and secondary glazing elements as to form a cavity therebetween, the cavity being at least partially evacuated to provide, owing to the reduced pressure within the cavity, that each glazing element is impinged inwardly in sealing contact onto the sealing strip to thus seal the glazing elements and the sealing strip together.According to a second aspect of this invention there is provided a method of double glazing comprising the steps of mounting a continuos impervious resilient sealing strip about a peripheral face section of a secondary glazing element to stand proud of that face, positioning the aforesaid sub assembly in face to face juxtaposition with a primary glazing element such that at least part of the sealing strip is interposed between the adjacent faces of the glazing elements to thereby form a cavity between the glazing elements, providing a closeable aperture to conjoin the cavity to atmosphere, at least partially evacuating the cavity through the aperture so that the lower air pressure so created therein causes the glazing elements to impinge inwardly in sealing contact onto the sealing strip and thus into a unitary assembly and then closing the aperture.In this specification the words primary and secondary are used to differentiate between the two glazing elements of a double glazed assembly. They are chosen as they are particularly suitable in describing utilisation of the invention towards its primary object, the double glazing of an existing in situ single glazed installation. As described hereinafter the invention is also suitable for use in prefabricating a double glazed window and the in situ fabrication of new double glazed assemblies. The use of such words relative to those forms of the invention should not be construed as limited factors but merely as a means of distinguishing one glazing element from the otier. Fig.l is a sectional view of an edge of a double glazed assembly depicting one means enabling the partial evacuation of the intermediate cavity, and lbigs.2 3 are similar views to Fig.l depicting two alternative means of achieving partial evacuation and ling.4 is a cross sectional view of a preferred sealing strip, and Fig.5 is a similar view to Fig.l depicting an in situ prefabricated modification of the invention.A continuous resilient sealing strip 3 is formed from an impervious resilient material such as a suitable plastics or rubberised material, for example, Neoprene trademark .Sealing strip 3 is formed into a continuous length shaped commensurate to the peripheral shape of glazing elements 6,7 in conjunction with which the sealing strip 3 is to be utilised, conventionally most often square or rectangular shaved. Sealing strip 3 is preferably formed from lengths thereof severed from a parent roll, the lengths corresponding to the lengths of the sides of the secondary glazing element 6, The lengths cf sealing strip have their ends fused together, such as with a mitre joint configuration, to correspond with the corners of the glazing element 6.Alternatively, a single length of sealing strip 3, correspondIng in length to the total peripheral length of glazing element , can have its ends fused together to form the required continuous sealing strip element. If such method is utilised preferably the corners of the secondary glazing element 6 are relieved, for exp1e rounded, to facilitate fitting of the seal thereto as described hereinafter.Referring in particular to Fig.4 preferably one face 5 of the sealing strip 3 is concavely dished in the transverse plane to facilitate sealing between the sealing strip 3 and a primary glazing element 7. The opposite face 8 of sealing strip 3 preferably incorporates a longitudinally extending dove tail shaped groove 9 in which a decorative strip 10 o any suitable configuration, colour or material can be affixed, such as by snap fastening within the groove 9, for aesthetic purposes.Such is particularly desirable s some impervious materials suitable for utilizaticr. as a sealing strip 3, including the preferred Neoprene trademark are only available, to the best of my knowledge, in black or alternatively it is preferable that the lack forms of suitable materials be utilised as these t nerally are more resistant to perishing.In a latera. face 11 of the sealing strip preferably a longitudJ.na ly extending glazing element edge receiving channel 12 . formed, the channel 12 being spaced away from the concave shaped face 5 of the sealing strip 3. In forming the sling strip into a continuous configuration as described aove the channel 12 thereof is disposed inwardly. In utilising the Invention a continuous sealing strip 3 is fitted about and t the edge of a commensurately shaped secondary glazing t ement 7, the edge of which is fitted to the channel 12 5th that the main body of the sealing strip 3 stands proud a face 6a of the secondary glazing element 6. The concav formed face 5 is thus spaced away from the secondary glazing element 6. The aforesaid sub assembly is then placed in face to face juxtaposition with the primary glazing elements 7, the sealing strip 3 being disposed therebetween with the concavely formed face 5 thereof butted up, in face to face relationship, against a peripherl section of the adjacent face 7 of the primary glazing element 7. A cavity 13 is thus formed between the glazing elements 6,7 and which is surrounded and thus peripherally defined by the sealing strip 3.Cavity 13 is then at least partially evacuated and it is the resultant pressure differential between the pressure within the cavity i3 and the external essentially atmospheric pressure that maintains the glazing elements 6,7 and the seali strip 3 as a unitary assembly. More particularly, the resultant lower pressure in the cavity 13 causes each glazing element to impinge in sealing contact inwardly toward one another and thus onto the sealing strip to thus hold the glazing elements 6,7 and the sealing strip 3 together.The means and the operational step by which the cavity 13 is at least partially evacuated is not critical. Further, it is found that only a small reduction in the pressure of the cavity is necessary to achieve the desired sealing and thus likewise sophisticated evacuation apparatus is not necessary. While total or substantially total evacuation of the cavity will be functionally adequate such action can lead to problems, for example, spacers may be necessary between the glazing elements to resist collapsing, other than inconsequential collapsing, therebetween.Referring in particular to Figs. 103, three methods by which partial evacuation of the cavity are now described.As depicted in Fig.2 in a preferred method a hollow probe in the form of a fine needle 14, for example a needle of a hypodermic needle device 15, is inserted through the wall of the sealing strip 3. The hypodermic device 15 is operated to partially evacuate cavity 13 whereupon the needle 14 is removed and it is found that the material of the sealing strip 3 is sufficiently resilient to take up the puncture formed therein by the needle and close such aperture as the needle 14 is removed.Referring to Fig.3 in a further method a needle 14 as aforesaid or a length of tube 18 of similar transverse dimension is inserted between the sealing strip 3 and the primary glazing element 7. The tube 18 can be substantially rigid or pliable, but of sufficient diametric strength to resist the compressing forces thereon caused by the partial evacuation and can be so inserted during or subsequent to the juxtaposition of the glazing elements 6,7. The partial evacuation of cavity 13 and the closing of the aperture so created can be achieved in similar manner to that described above or alternatively by coupling the hose 18 to an evacuation pump 16. At the point of entry of hose 18 the sealing strip takes up against the face of the primary glazing element 7 upon withdrawal of the tube 18 from therebetween.In a third method as depicted in Fig.l a valve 17 of any suitable convention and known construction can be included as an integral part of either the glazing elements 6,7 or the sealing strip 3. Preferably the valve 17 is mounted in an aperture 19 formed through the secondary glazing element 6 but, however mounted, the valve 17 remains as an integral component of the assembly. Valve 17 forms a closeable aperture through which the partial evacuation of the cavity 13 takes place by utlising suitable evacuation means,for example, an evacuation pump, as described above, coupled to the valve 17. The invention is also suitable for utilisation in and as prefabricated double glazed assemblies. Such can be constructed substantially in accordance with the above, that is, fabricating a single glazed window assembly including a frame and then adding a secondary glazing element thereto.Alternatively, two glazing elements, without any framing, can be joined into a double glazed assembly as described abode and then fitted to a frame, in such case, the primary glazing element being marginally oversized relative to the secondary glazing elfflm2nt to provide for its subsequent mounting to a frame.Additionally, referring in particular to Fig.5 a sealing strip 20 fabricated into a continuous form and otherwise similar to sealing strip 3, can incorporate an outer anchoring rib 21 and two, spaced apart, inwardly positioned glazing clement edge receiving channels 22,23. By way of anchor rib 21 the sealing strip 20 can be permanently fixed in situ, such as during the construction of a building, and thereafter glazing elements mounted in each channel 22,23 by flexing outwardly the outer wall of each channel 22,23 to thus snap fasten glazing elements thereinto. Spacers can be incorporated between the glazing elements to resist their collapsing together.One or other of the glazing elements can incorporate a valve, such as valve 17, to achieve the partial evacuation of the cavity 25 therebetween or alternatively the partial evacuation may be achieved by utilising an hypodermic needle device as described above.Experiments and testing to date have shown that it is not necessary to utilise an adhesive between either of the glazing elements 6,7 and the sealing strip 3 to provide adequate sealing and strength. However, it is envisaged that an adhesive could be so utilised either or both as an adjunct fasten nag means or as a means of pre positioning the sealing strip 3 in readiness for the partial evacuation of the cavity 13. With respect to the former aspect such could provide a safety factor should a double glazed assembly be fractured thus destroying the vacuum seal characteristic thereof. It is envisaged that the adhesive would limit the spread of any broken free glazing pieces. Under the second aspect by utilising, for example, a contact adhesive sealing strip could be at least temporarily positioned to either a secondary or a primary glazing element znd the remaining glazing element similarly positioned in such temporary manner. Such would eliminate the need for the glazing element edge retaining channel 12 as, for example, the two opposite edges 5,8 could be so tenporarily fixed against the respective glazing elements.
