# Reusable releasable fastener.

## Abstract
A reusable, releasable, tamper resistant fastener 10 for releasable attachment to the free end of shaft 14 is provided. The fastener comprises a hollow body 20 having a lower portion 24 and an upper portion 26 defining a cavity 28 therebetween. The lower portion has an aperture 30 therethrough and the upper portion has an elongated slot 32 therein. The central portion 38 of the slot is aligned with the aperture. A one piece spring steel slip 22 is nonrotationally received in the cavity and has a nondeformed position for retaining a received shaft and a resiliently deformed position for release of a retained shaft. A specially configured tool T is provided for insertion through the slot and then rotation relative thereto for selective resilient deformation of the clip to selectively release retained shafts.
