# Carbonate production.

## Abstract
A solution of a di alkyl carbonate, e.g. dimethyl carbon ate, in the corresponding alcohol, e.g. methanol, is concen trated by contacting the solution with a hydrophobic zeolite e.g. silicalite. The di alkyl carbonate is absorbed preferential ly. Where the solution also contains water, e.g. as in the case of the products from certain di alkyl carbonate synthesis reactions, the water can be removed using a hydrophilic zeolite prior to recycle of the alcohol.
