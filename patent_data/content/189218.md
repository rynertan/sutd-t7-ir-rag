# Conveying device.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a conveying device comprising a platform conveyor 1 , which is provided with a plurality of rec tangular platforms 4 , each being flexible in one direction, and with two pairs of endless chains 5, 6 , the pairs being con nected to the corners at the front and rear side, respectively, of the platforms and being led over pairs of aligned guide sprockets, the chains 5, 6 extending substantially parallel to each other and guiding the platforms 4 in a substantially horizontal position from a load point 3 to an unload point through a transport part 9 and bringing them back through a return part 11 , the transport part 9 including a section hav ing a substantial vertical component 7 . According to the invention the platform conveyor 1 in cludes a substantially horizontal section 8 near the load or unload point 10 , and at this load or unload point 10 the plat form conveyor is connectively coupled to an unload or load point 15 of a similar second platform conveyor, the load or unload point thereof being lockable at a fixed level, the substantially horizontal sections 8, 12 of both platform con veyors 1, 2 which are connected to each other, together be ing adjustable in the vertical direction, and during the height ad justment the connecting point of both platform conveyors 10, 15 is movable in the substantially horizontal direction.
