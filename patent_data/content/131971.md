# Connecting mechanism of light source device for endoscope.

## Abstract
A connecting mechanism has a cylindrical socket 44 mounted on a light source device 41 , and a cylindrical member 51 fitted to the outside of the socket. The member is engaged with a first type of connector to hold it when the connector is connected to the socket. A slide ring 56 is arranged opposite to the cylindrical member to be movable between a normal position and an evacuating position. In a normal position, the slide ring is engaged with a second type of connector of an endoscope to hold it when the second type connector is connected the socket. When the third type of connector 88 is to be connected to the socket, the slide ring is in contact with the third type of connector and moved from the normal position to the evacuating position by the third type connector, thereby allowing the third type connector to be connected to the socket.
