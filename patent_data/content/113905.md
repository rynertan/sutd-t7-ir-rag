# Ink fountain in a printing press.

## Abstract
An ink fountain has at least one position display means 41 for displaying a position of each ductor blade piece to be preset before printing and at least one position indicating means 38 for indicating an actual position of the blade piece. A gap between the distal end of the blade piece and the sur face of an ink fountain roller is adjusted in such a manner that the actual position of the blade piece 12a is registered with the position, to be preset, of the blade piece 12a by operating an adjusting member 14 .
