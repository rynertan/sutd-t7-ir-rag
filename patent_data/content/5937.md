# A support wheel for a track laying vehicle.

## Abstract
A one piece support wheel for the track of a track laying vehicle is formed from molten metal, conveniently an aluminium and or magnesium alloy, and comprises a disc 10 and a rim 12 wherein the adjacent parts thereof are of T shaped configuration. The disc is dished and has a centre part 16 extending axially beyond one of the rim edges 18 , such edge being protected against wear by the provision of replaceable wear strips or by hard facing. A pair of such wheels are assembled with the centre parts in contact so that the rims are spaced to provide a continuous groove to accommodate the horns on a track.

## Description
wheels This invention relates to wheels and in particular to wheels for track laying vehicles, that is vehicles which travel on endless tracks which extend beneath a number of support wheels and around one or more traction wheels. The invention is concerned with the constructional details of support wheels for track laying vehicles. It Is an object of the invention to provide an improved form of support wheel for a track laying vehicle. The invention provides a one piece support wheel for a track laying vehicle, said wheel comprising a disc and a rim, the adjacent parts of the disc and rim together being of Tshape and the disc being of dished configuration with the centre part of the disc extending axially of the wheel beyond one of the edges of the rim. Such wheels are arranged to be secured together In pairs in a back to back configuration so that a continuous circumferential groove is provided between each pair of wheels into which horns on the track project to guide the movement of the track beneath the wheels. By arranging the adjacent parts of the disc and rim to be of T sh pe so that the wheel disc merges with the rim in the central portion of the rim, it is possible more equally to balance the manner in which the disc is loaded by the rim as compared with wheel arrangements in which the disc and rim merge at or adjacent one of the edges of the rim. Also, because of the T shape of the disc and rim, the edge ol vh√ß m adjaecct the track horns when the wheel is in use, is spaced an appreciable distance from the zone where the disc and rim merge. Thus an appreciable amount of wear can take place at the edge of the rim adjacent the horns without the strength of the wheel being greatly affected.This is an important consideration as the wear at this edge of the rim, due to contact with the track horns, can be severe. It will also be appreciated that by making the wheel in one piece the number of manufacturing steps required to produce the wheel is reduced since it is not necessary to join the disc and rim. Preferably the wheel is made from an alloy of aluminium and or magnesium. One of the 7000 series of alloys, which are aluminium, magnesium, zinc alloys, specified by theAmerican Aluminum Association may conveniently be used.Reduction in the weight of the wheels of a track laying vehicle reduces the inertia forces generated in the vehicle suspension system and enables the vehicle to travel faster over rough ground. A support wheel in accordance with the invention will normally be provided with a solid rubber tyre which is bonded onto the outer peripheral surface of the rim. The rim may be cylindrical or may be tapered so that the outer peripheral surface of the rim is closer to the rotary axis of the wheel at the edges of the rim than at the centre of the rim. The edge of the rim of the heel which will be positioned adjacent to the track horns may be reinforced to resist the wear referred to above. For example, means for resisting wear may be embedded in the appropriate rim edge, attached to the rim edge as replaceable strips or studs, or the edge may be overlaid with a hard facing. Specific examples ce embedded wear resisting means are a steel hoop or wires, metal carbide filaments and or particles, or metal carbide textiles. Alternatively rin or screw attached replaceable wear strips of steel or other metal or metal carbides may be used. Studs of similar material to the wear strips referred to above can also be employed. If an overlaid hard facing is employed this can be provided by applying a hard material using flame or plasma spraying or electroplating. The wheel may also include radially extending reinforcing ribs which extend on one or both sides of the disc between the disc and rim. The wheel is also preferably provided with an accurately formed and positioned cylindrical datum surface which is concentric with the rotary axis of the wheel and which is used to locate the wheel while the tyr e is moulded onto the rim. One embodiment of the present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which FIGURE 1 is a half radial section through a support wheel embodying the present invention, and FIGURE 2 is a view in the direction of the arrow A of Figure 1 showing a complete wheel on a reduced scale. Referring to Figure 1 this shows a one piece aluminium wheel for a track laying vehicle zoziprisfng r.a dishes disc port on 10 and a rim portion 12. The disc merges into the rim substantially in the axially central zone 111 of the rim so that the adjacent portions of the disc and rtm together are of T shape. The centre portion 16 of the disc 10 extends axially beyond the edge 18 of the rim 12 so that if a second similar wheel 20, shown in dotted lines in Figure 1, is secured to the wheel 11 so that the wheels are in back to back configuration a continuous, circumferentially extending grove is provided between the two wheels into which the horns on the track not shown are arranged to extend, and guide the track beneath the wheels. Bolt holes 22 are provided in the centre portion 16 for securing the two wheels together and also for securing the wheels to a hub of the vehicle. The outer peripheral surfaces of the rims are cylindrical as shown at 24. This assists in locating a solid rubber tyre not shown on each rim. The tyre is moulded in situ on the rim, the wheel being located in a mould during this moulding process using a cylindrical datum surface 26 on the inner side of the rim or the surface 27 adjacent the centre of the dIsc, In eIther case the the ic being accurately located on the wheel about the rotary axis thereof. The wheel is formed from molten metal. The surfaces 24 and 26 and 27 may be machined on the wheel after forming and prior to the moulding of the rubber tyre on the rim. The edge portion 28 of the rim which will be adjacent the track horns may be reinforced using any of the arrangements described above. Also the wheel may be reinforced by radially extending ribs on either side of the disc and which extend between the disc and rim portions of the wheel. For example, such ribs may extend across the shaded portion X ofFigure 1. The present invention thus provides an improved f rm CT support wheel for a track laying vehicle.
