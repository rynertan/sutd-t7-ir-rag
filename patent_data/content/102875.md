# CONNECTOR FOR CERAMIC HYBRID CIRCUITS FOR WELL LOGGING TOOLS AND METHOD FOR CONNECTING CERAMIC HYBRID CIRCUITS FOR USE IN WELL LOGGING TOOLS

## Abstract
A connector for a ceramic hybrid circuit to operatively associate the circuit to a cartridge chassis within a well logging tool in a well borehole, has a plurality of spring loaded electrically conductive contact pins which support the ceramic hybrid circuit so that it may sufficiently and freely move, without damage thereto, as a result of thermal expansion and contraction caused by temperature changes in the borehole and the ceramic hybrid circuit is sufficiently restrained to prevent damage thereto from shock and vibration forces exerted upon the well logging tool.
