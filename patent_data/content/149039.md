# O RING JOINT

## Abstract
An O ring joint, between a female and a male part which are designed to be able to be displaced telescopically relatively to each other for obtaining a seal, is characterized in that the female part 1 is provided with a groove 7 encircling a cylindrical inner surface thereof, said groove being intended to receive an O ring 3 , the external diameter of which is equal to the outer diameter of the groove, and in that the O ring is intended to be deformed elastically inside a closed annular space between the male and the female parts in order to seal the joint, said annular space being bounded by the groove of the female part, by an annular surface 15 of the female part which adjoins that side 10 of the groove which is remote from the male part, and by a bevel 12 on the outside of the male part.
