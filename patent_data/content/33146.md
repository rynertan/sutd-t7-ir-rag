# Resin compositions containing a polyphenylene ether.

## Abstract
A resin composition based on a polyphenylene ether comprising 99 to 1 part by weight of a polyphenylene ether copolymer derived from 99.5 to 85 mole of 2,6 dimethylphenol and 0.5 to 15 mole of 3 methyl 6 tert butylphenol and 1 to 99 parts by weight of a styrene polymer making up 100 parts by weight in total and said resin composition further containing 0.1 to 100 parts by weight of a rubber like polymer for 100 parts by weight of the said resin composition. These resin compositions are excel lent in mechanical strengths, heat resistance, and moldability and are suitable as molding resin materials in practical use fields.
