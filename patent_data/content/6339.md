# Multi function end effector for performing operations on a nuclear steam generator tubesheet equipment.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a multi function end effector 200 for performing operations on a tubesheet 28 of a nuclear steam generator 20 to which hazardous environ ment limits human access. A vertical member 202 is sup ported by the tubesheet through an attachment mecha nism 204 , a body 92 and camlocks 112, 120. The verti cal member has a horizontal table 208 which is capable of positioning tools 234 in relation to the tubesheet and capable of driving the tools. The table comprises a center ing device 290 for positioning the tools in proper rela tion to the tubesheet The horizontal table has a crescent shaped gear 222 which provides a receptacle to hold the tools in place and prevent rotation and also provides rotary motion of the tools.
