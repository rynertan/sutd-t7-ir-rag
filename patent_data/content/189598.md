# Method for manufacturing a semiconductor device.

## Abstract
Semiconductor body 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 is prepared and a film 11 is formed on the semiconductor body 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 , followed by forming an interconnection layer of aluminum alloy on the insulating film 11 . A silicon oxide film 17 is formed on the interconnection layer 15 , followed by removing that portion of the silicon oxide film 17 which is situated on a predetermined trimming area of the intercon nection layer 15 . A silicon nitride film 21 is formed on the whole surface of the resultant structure. An energy beam L is directed onto the predetermined trimming area of the interconnection layer 15 , causing the interconnection layer 15 to be locally heated to 400 to 600 C whereby atoms in the interconnection layer 15 migrate to permit the interconnec tion layer 15 to be trimmed.
