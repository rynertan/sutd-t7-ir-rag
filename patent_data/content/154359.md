# Fabric cleaning conditioning compositions.

## Abstract
Fabric cleaning conditioning compositions of improved stability are disclosed for use through the wash in conjunc tion with machine dryers. This is accomplished by incorpor ating a low level of polyethylene glycol into small, discrete amine salt nodules. These nodules pass virtually unchanged through the wash and rinse become entangled in the fabrics when spun or wrung out and then melt, spread, and condition the fabrics when heated in a dryer.
