# Fender system for a floating structure.

## Abstract
A fender system 22 for a floating structure 10 such as an off shore platform wherein a column 18 supporting the platform has a plurality of vertically spaced rail members 24 that are interconnected by a plurality of horizontally spaced and vertically extending bumpers 56 that can be contacted by a vessel for transmitting the force therefrom to the fender system. The rail members support a plurality of spaced shafts on which are mounted pairs of interconnected torsion spring members 28 that are operative to exert opposing forces while bearing on the column to absorb the forces exerted on the fender system.
