## Description
KEYBOARD TERMINAL This invention relates to the field of automatic test equipment, and more particularly to a keyboard terminal for entering test programs into computerized automatic test equipment ATE . Typically, sophisticated ATE configured as an automatic test station finds wide application in the avionics instrumentation field. Examples of such ATE are found in the computerized automatic testers CAT series sold by Grumman Aerospace Corporation. Automatic testing of the various electronic systems and subsystems of an aircraft may be readily conducted by means of such automatic test equipment in conjunction with usergenerated test programs. ATLAS is a high level computer programming language intended specifically for automatic test programming.It is at this time becoming standard, on an industry wide basis, and is likely to be used as the source for the great majority of test programs developed over the next several years. As a programming language, ATLAS is characterized by the use of common English words and grammar. For this reason, it requires more characters per instruction, as compared with other, older mathematical format test languages. Accordingly, more time and effort are required of programmers and test engineers who use the ATLAS language. In addition, test programs written in theATLAS language often contain errors introduced by the normally lengthy typing process. Accordingly, conventional keyboard terminals for entering test programs written in an English format computer programming language, such asATLAS, are afflicted with the same drawbacks and limitations. An optimal keyboard for entering test programs written in an English format computer programming language into computerized automatic test systems should have several basic capabilities. First, it should reduce the physical time and effort required to enter program words into the system. Second, it should be relatively errorfree. And finally, it should have the capability to generate an entire word of the programming language in response to relatively few keystroke entries. It is accordingly an objection of the present invention to overcome the aforementioned limitations and drawbacks and to provide a keyboard terminal for entering test program words into computerized automatic test systems having the desirable attributes noted above. It is an object of an embodiment of the present invention to provide an ATLAS language keyboard terminal. According to the present invention, there is provided a keyboard terminal comprising keyboard means including a plurality of user activated test language keys and preprogrammed means operatively connected and responsive to said plurality of user activated test language keys for generating a corresponding plurality of word character strings, wherein each of said word character strings represents a unique word of a predetermined test programming language. The preprogrammed means preferably also includes means for transferring the generated word character strings to a control computer. An embodiment of the present invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which FIGURE 1 is a block diagram of the keyboard terminal, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention and FIGURES 2 A and B illustrate the character assignment and the corresponding test language keys, respectively, for the keyboard utilized in the terminal illustrated in FIGURE 1. A block diagram of an embodiment of the keyboard terminal of the present invention is illustrated in FIGURE 1. As shown therein, the keyboard terminal includes a standard programmable keyboard 100 and a microprocessor control system 200. The programmable keyboard 100, such as, for example, the MicroSwitch Model 103SD30 2 Intelligent Keyboard with 128 key option, has been modified to contain a plurality of definable keys for initiating single key activation of the unique keywords used in composing a predetermined English format test program.For example, in the case of the ATLAS test programming language, keyboard 100 would have more than seventy definable keys, each corresponding to a unique ATLAS keyword. The correspondence between the character assignment and the corresponding ATLAS test language keys for theMicroSwitch keyboard is illustrated in FIGURES 2 A and B.Comparing the character assignment illustrated in FIGURE 2A with the test language keys illustrated in FIGURE 2B, it is noted that the upper left test language key F1 is utilized by the user to change from the conventional keyboard illustrated in FIGURE 2A to the test language keyboard illustrated in FIGURE 2B. More specifically, depressing the F1 key allows the user to switch from typewriter letter format to the ATLAS language keyboard. A microprocessor control system 200 including a microprocessor 210, such as, for example, Intel 8080, and an associated read only memory ROM 220, such as, for example, Intel 8ZS115, is preprogrammed to generate an appropriate word character string for each of the test language keywords upon activation of the corresponding key on keyboard 100. The operation of the microprocessor control system 200 is as follows. A keystroke generates an interrupt to microprocessor 210 causing it to read its input output port and obtain the numerical code generated as a result of the keystroke. The numerical code is used as a pointer to a table in ROM 220 which allows a routine in microprocessor 210 to fetch the appropriate ASCII string that represents the ATLAS keyword unique to the key on keyboard 100 that was activated. The ASCII word character string is then transferred via conventional means not shown , such as, for example, an IEEE 488 1975 bus compatible interface network to a control computer 300 associated with an automatic test system not shown . To facilitate understanding of the operation of the keyboard terminal of the present invention, an illustrative example may be helpful. Using the ATLAS verb MEASURE as an example, the following sequence of operations illustrates how the keyboard terminal is used to generate an entire word from a single keystroke. If the keyboard 100 is not in the test language mode, the user first depresses the F1 key to place it in that mode. To enter the test word MEASURE the user interacts with keyboard 100 which contains a number of definable keys corresponding to the number of test words in the ATLAS language. Pressing the key on keyboard 100 corresponding to the test word MEASURE causes a signal to be generated and transmitted to the microprocessor control system 200. Upon receipt of the signal generated by the activation of the MEASURE key, the preprogrammed microprocessor 210 causes the ASCII characters corresponding to the ATLAS test word MEASURE stored in ROM 220 to be read out of the memory and the word character string to be transferred to the control computer 300. In a like manner, other keys on keyboard 100 are programmed to generate other ATLAS words, such as VERIFY , VOLTAGE , etc. so that the user can construct complete ATLAS statements made up of combinations of automatically generated ATLAS words and conventionally typed punctuation and characters.
