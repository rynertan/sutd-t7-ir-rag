## Description
Sealing ring for a pipe jointThe invention relates to a sealing ring for a pipe joint, comprising an annular fixation part for fastening a sealing ring on or to the end portion of a pipe part, and an annular sealing lip which is joined to the fixation part and consists of a substantially frustoconical web which is provided, at least on its inner side, with at least one projecting annular sleeve rib.A sealing ring of this kind is known.Usually known sealing rings for joints for thermoplastic pipes, for example of polyvinyl chloride, are produced from elastomer materiai, such as rubber, which is vulcanized in order to obtain the desired properties. A type of rubber frequently used is styrene butadiene rubber. This material has properties such that sealing rings of this material are very suitable for use in joints for thermoplastic pipes.Because of the relatively low modulus of elasticity of the material, the pressure force exerted on the pipe by a ring made of this material is limited and, since the material is soft, a good seal is obtained on a pipe surface which is not entirely smooth.A disadvantage of this sealing ring is however the fact that its production is time consuming, particularly because of the vulcanization time needed.In the past it has therefore been attempted to find materials for sealing rings for thermoplastic pipes which do not require vulcaniza ion. Materials thus worthy of consideration are the soc led thermoplastic rubbers, which can be given the require sap by injection moulding. However, mary thermoplasti rubbers cannot meet the requirements ir. ose on sealer rings for thermoplastic pipes. In parti clar, requirements in respect of long term behaviour of sealing rings for pipes for the discharge of waste water cannot be met.Although in recent years thermoplastic rubbers have come on the market which in general have the desired properties for use as material for sealing rings for ther oplastic pipes, it appears that particularly their hardness and modulus of elasticity are still considerably higher than those of rubbers normally used for sealing rings. This has the consequence that, if the shape of a sealing ring of thermoplastic rubber is to be kept the same as that of a sealing ring of the usual rubber material, a good seal is not obtained.It is the object of the invention to provide a sealing ring of the type initially defined above, which does not show the abovernentioned disadvantages.According to the invention this object is attained with a sealing ring which has the characteristic that the sealing lip consists of a thermoplastic rubber having a hardness of more than 550 Shore A and a modulus of elasticity at 10 elongation of more than 5 N mm2, and that at least one of the sleeve ribs on the side coming into contact with a pipe wall is provided with at least one projecting annular side rib.A sealing ring of this kind can be produced quickly, for example by injection moulding, and the sealing lip has an apparent softness such that a good seal can be made on therrnoplastic pipes, even if the surface of the latter is not completely smooth because of the presence of grooves or s ratches. The sleeve rib is preferably provided with a plurality of side ribs.In an advantageous embodiment, a plurality of sleeve ribs are provided with one or more side ribs.The fixation part of the sealing ring may consist of a head portion of thermoplastic rubber, which can be fixed on or to the end portion of a pipe part by means of a separate fixation element.The fixation part preferably consists of a head portion of thermoplastic rubber and of a fixation element of thermoplastic material, said fixation element being bonded to the head portion and adapted to be fastened on the end portion of a pipe part, and expediently being made of a polyolefin material, while both the sealing lip and the head portion are made of a thermoplastic rubber based on a polyolefin.A sealing ring is thus obtained which can be produced by co injection, while a very good adhesion between the fixation element and the head part with the sealing lip is achieved, and which can be fitted as a single element on the end portion of a pipe part.The invention will now be explained by the description of an example of embodiment and with reference to the drawing, wherein Figure 1 is a cross section of a specific embodiment of the sealing ring according to the invention,Figure 2 is a cross section of another embodiment of the sealing ring according to the invention, and Figure 3 is a cross section of a preferred embodiment of the sealing ring according to the invention, with an integral fixation element.Figure 1 shows a sealing ring 1 according to the invention, which comprises a fixation part 2 for fastening a sealing ring 1 on an end portion not shown of a pipe part, and an annular sealing lip 3 which is joined to the fastening part 2 and which consists of a substantially frustoconical web 4 provided on its inner side with three projecting circumfe rental sleeve ribs 5, 6, 7. On the outer side three circumferential sleeve ribs 8, 9, 10 are also provided. On the side which comes into contact with a pipe wall the inner sleeve ribs 6, 7 are provided with annular side ribs11 projecting substantially radially inwards.In the embodiment of the sealing ring 1 shown in Figure 2, the fixation part 2 is slightly different and the web 4 of the sealing lip 3 is provided on its inner and outer sides with a pair of sleeve ribs 12, 13 and 14, 15 respectively.The sleeve rib 12 is provided with a side rib 11 and the sleeve rib 13 is provided with two side ribs 11 extending substantially radially inwards.The sealing rings are made entirely of a thermoplastic rubber having a hardness of more than 550 Shore A measured in accordance with ASTM D 2440 , and a modulus of elasticity at 10 elongation of more than 5 N mm2 measured in accordance with ASTM D 412 . Through the presence of side ribs 11 the sealing lip 3 is given an apparent softness, so that, despite the fact that the hardness and the elastic modulus of the thermoplastic rubber are higher than those of, for ex ..ple, styrene butadiene rubber, which has a hardness of abtt 550 Shore A and a modulus of elasticity of 4.2 N mm2, the sealin ring nevertheless can be satisfactorily used as a sealing ring for a thermoplastic pipe joint.The two sleeve ribs, 7, 10 and 13, 15 respectively at the end of the sealing lip 3 form together a V shaped cross section, and the outermost sleeve rib 10 and 15 respectively may or may not lie substantially in line with the web 4 of the sealing lip 3.The head portion 2 of the sealing ring 1 may be fixed on or to an end portion of a pipe part by means of a separate fixation element.Figure 3 shows a sealing ring 16 in an embodiment in which a fixation element 17 is bonded to a head portion 18, which in turn is integral with the sealing lip 3, which in this embodiment is identical with the sealing lip 3 of the sealing ring shown in Figure 1. It is clear that a sealing lip 3 of the type used in the embodiment shown in Figure 2 can also be bonded in this way to the fixation element 17. The fixation element 17 is provided with annular ridges 191 20 adapted to cooperate with complementarily shaped annular depressions in the outer side of the end portion of a pipe part.In the case of the sealing ring shown in Figure 3, the fixation element 17 expediently consists of a polyolefin material, preferably polypropylene, and the sealing lip 3 and the heal portion 16 of a thermoplastic rubber based on a preferably polyolefin. olypropylene. Very good adhesion can thus be obtained between the fixation element 17 and the head portion 18, particularly if the head portion 18 is made of a tnermoplastic rubber based on the same material as that of which the fixation element 17 is made. The shape of the sealing ring according to the invention is not restricted to the embodiments described above. Thus, within the scope of the invention the sealing lip may be provided with more or fewer sleeve ribs, and the number of side ribs on a sleeve rib may vary. Alternative shapes may also be used for the head portion or a fixation element.
