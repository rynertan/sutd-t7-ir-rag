# METHOD FOR MANUFACTURING A SPECTACLE GLASS FOR MYOPES

## Abstract
There is described a method for manufacturing a spec table glass for myopes the edge thickness of which may be considered as substantial, which comprises starting with a semi machined product with a concave hollowing which extends to the edge or substantially to the edge of the glass, milling away about 40 to 51 of the glass edge thickness, and radiusing convexly thereafter the sharp angle between said concave hollowing and the plane milled portion of the glass which surrounds said concave hollowing.
