# Human monoclonal antibodies from lymphocytes of patients with malignant melanoma.

## Abstract
The present invention provides hybridomas producing human monoclonal antibodies and a method for forming such hybridomas. The human monoclonal antibody producing hybridoma cell lines were formed by fusing a human myeloma cell line, a mouse myeloma cell line or human lymphoblastoid cell line with human lymphocytes from normal individuals and from individuals having malignant melonoma. The lymphocytes were obtained from lymph node or tumor specimen of normal individuals having malignant melanoma. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from normal individuals or individuals having malignant melanoma were also used in the fusions. HmAb produced by these hybridoma cell lines recognize cell surface antigens or cytoplasmic components of human cells and are useful for differentiating between normal and malignant cells.
