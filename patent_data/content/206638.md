# Liquid gas bubble separator.

## Abstract
A liquid gas bubble separator comprising a container 11 having an inlet 13 for a fluid which includes liquid and gas bubbles, an outlet 15 and upstream and downstream vents 17, 19 . A filter element 21 is provided in the container between the inlet 13 and the outlet 15 . The filter element 21 permits the passage of the liquid and inhibits the passage of the gas bubbles. The filter element 21 is between the upstream and downstream vents 17, 19 so that gas bubbles which do not pass through the filter element 21 can be vented through the upstream vent 17 , and any gas bubbles down stream of the filter element 21 can be vented through the downstream vent 19 . A bypass 71 is provided around the filter element 21 . A portion of the filtered fluid is recirculated through the bypass passage 71 to prevent forward flow through the bypass passage 71 when the filter element 21 is clean, and such recirculating flow is terminated when the filter element 21 is clogged to a predetermined degree to thereby open the bypass passage 71 for forward flow. The separator is particularly suitable for use as a venous reservoir bag.
