# Transmission having a spring applied centrifugally sensitive clutch.

## Abstract
A planetary transmission has a fluid applied brake 46 for a low speed ratio and a fluid release spring applied clutch 48 for a high speed ratio. The clutch apply springs 142 respond to a centrifugally actuated member 144 such that below a predetermined output speed the springs are not compressed sufficiently to cause engagement of the clutch. The clutch is maintained disengaged by the fluid pressure 86, 116 which engages the brake regardless of output speed. The inter change of the brake and clutch are selectively controlled by controlling the fluid pressure source 26.
