# EXPANDER GENERATOR CONTROL SYSTEM

## Abstract
An expander 16 driven by waste fluid is operatively connected to a synchronous 26 or induction 26 generator. A brake 66 clutch 166 controller selectively connects the power recovery string to an eddy current brake 28 flywheel 130 in order to maintain line frequency and control speed during normal conditions and to minimize acceleration of the string during a load dump.
