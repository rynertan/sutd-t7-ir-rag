# Aqueous fabric softening composition.

## Abstract
An aqueous fabric softening composition containing less than 10 cationic softener also includes an alkoxylated fatty amine having up to 7 alkylene oxide groups per molecule, such as ethoxylated tallow amine at exemplified levels of 4.0 to 12.0 . The alkoxylated compound enhances the softening and anti static properties of the composition.
