# POLARIZED ELECTROMAGNET AND ITS USE IN A POLARIZED ELECTROMAGNETIC RELAY

## Abstract
A polarized electromagnet comprises a generally E shaped yoke 1 including a pair of outer legs 2, 3 and an intermediate leg 6 therebetween, the three legs 2, 3, 6 being interconnected by a base portion 4 , and a coil 5 wound about the intermediate leg 6 . A generally U shaped armature 7 comprises a permanent magnet 10 and two pole plates 8, 9 attached to both ends of the permanent magnet 10 . The armature 7 is so positioned that each pole plate 8, 9 extends between the intermediate leg 6 and a respective one of the outer legs 2, 3 of the yoke 1 . The armature 7 may be fitted into a generally U shaped resin member 12 integrally molded with portions 13a, 13b extending outwardly to opposite sides of the pole plates 8, 9 and slidable engaged in guide slots 11a, 11b provided in the outer yoke legs 2, 3 . When used in an electromagnet ic relay, these projecting portions 13a, 13b form actuating members engaging movable contacts of the relay.
