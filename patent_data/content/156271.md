# Condition responsive sensing apparatus.

## Abstract
A condition responsive apparatus is provided with a sen sor channel 20 that is interconnected to a capillary tube restriction 41 which can be readily interchanged on the device to change the response of a condition responsive sen sor 30 . A very small sensor 30 is placed in the sensor channel 20 . The sensor channel 20 and the capillary tube 41 can be placed generally parallel to one another to reduce the overall length of the apparatus.
