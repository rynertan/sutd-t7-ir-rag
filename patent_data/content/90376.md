# Magnetic head apparatus.

## Abstract
A magnetic recording head apparatus includes a magnet ic head body 10 opposing a travelling magnetic tape 12 a tuning circuit 29 having the head body 10 as a variable in ductance element a high frequency signal source 20 for generating a high frequency signal 46 and a detector 30 connected to the tuning circuit 29 . The inductance of the head body 10 is changed in accordance with a change in the magnetic signal field applied from the magnetic tape 12 . The high frequency signal 46 is amplitude modulated in accord ance with the high frequency signal 46 . A peak or envelope waveform of the modulated high frequency signal is detected by a detector, thereby obtaining a reproduced information sig nal.
