# A NAVIGATION RADAR SYSTEM

## Abstract
The invention relates to a navigation radar system in which a secondary radar responder provides a reply in respon se to an interrogation radar signal received from a primary ra dar transmitter. The frequency of the received radar signal is monitored by the responder and the response is transmitted at a frequency which is off set from that of the interrogation si gnal so that the response can be received by the primary radar and distinguished from primary radar echoes.
