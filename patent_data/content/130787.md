# An electrophotographic method for the formation of two colored images.

## Abstract
An electrophotographic method for the formation of two colored images comprising 1 uniformly charging the surface of a photoreceptor having a conductrive substance and a photoconductive layer formed on the conductive substance, said photoconductive layer being sensitive to a first color, 2 exposing a two colored original, to form on said photoconduc tive layer an electrostatic latend image, which corresponds to a second color region in the original, with the same polarity as the electric charges on the surface of said photoconductive lay er, 3 subjecting the surface of said photoreceptor to a reversal development treatment by the use of a photoconductive color toner charged with the same polarity as the electric charges constituting said electrostatic latent image, to develop the non charged region with the photoconductive color toner, 4 sub jecting said electrostatic latent image to a normal development treatment by the use of an insulative toner having a color diffe rent from the color of said photoconductive color toner, and 5 charging the color toners on said photoconductive layer with a different polarity from the charging polarity in process 1 and simultaneously exposing said original through a filter shielding against said first color, thereby providing a practical method for the formation of a desired two colored distinct image corre sponding to the original.
