# Braiding machine.

## Abstract
A braiding machine which has higher speeds of opera tion, versatile material handling characteristics and is able to handle larger lengths of strands between reloads. Inside and outside sets of a plurality, e.g., eight, of circumferentially spaced bobbins C,F are mounted in axially spaced relation ship for rotation in opposite directions on a common axis. The carriers E for the inside bobbins F are also circumferentially spaced and mounted on slotted plates D rotatable in the same direction as the outside bobbins C . These carriers alternately bridge and clear the slots 20 . An eyelet G for each of the outside bobbins C rotates in the same direction as the plates D and the outside bobbins and synchronously move into and out of the slots 20 to carry the strands from the outside bobbins C between, under, between and over adjacent inside bobbins F as the supports rotate. The eyelets G are guided by semi cylindrical bearing surfaces 92, 96 on the supporting frame and are moved through alternating semi cylindrical paths of movement by notched gears 120, 122 rotatably supported on the frame.
