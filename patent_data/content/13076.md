# Process and apparatus for producing metallic slurries.

## Abstract
A method of cooling a flow of a molten material involves simultaneously subjecting the flow to a stirring action which is such that the temperature of the material is substantially the same at any point in any one plane perpendicular to the direction of flow. The cooling may be applied to a molten material to bring it either closer to its melting point of liquidus temperature or to bring it within its freezing range where this is desired as in, for example, the production of metallic slur ries. In apparatus for cooling a flow of a molten material hav ing means for cooling and means for simultaneously stirring the flow, both means preferably comprise at least one ele ment extending transversely within a duct through which the flow is directed. The element, which may be a hollow rod arranged to carry a flow of a coolant, is preferably made of a highly conducting material e.g. graphite or a metal whereas the walls of the duct are preferably of a insulating material. By this means nearly all of the cooling effect can be concentrated in the elements which permits close control over the cooling action. The number, arrangement and size of the elements will depend on the degree of cooling required and on the amount of stirring which is necessary to achieve even cooling along the duct. The cooled flow, after passing through the duct, is conve niently led into a mould or series of moulds or into a casting machine in which solidification to give a shaped article takes place.
