# SUPPRESSION OF FLICKER IN INTERLACED VIDEO IMAGES

## Abstract
Perception of flicker in interlaced video images is sup pressed by testing each pixel in an image for an intensity value below a first predetermined threshold modifying, for each tested pixel, an intensity value representation for each nearest neighbour pixel along a first axis of said interlaced image having an intensity value exceeding a second pre determined threshold, if the intensity value of the tested pixel is below the first predetermined threshold and displaying, on a video display device, an interlaced image generated by the steps of testing and modifying.
