## Description
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for monitoring redox reactions, particularly but not exclusively physiological redox reactions that occur in the human or animal body, particularly those which occur during the menstrual cycle at ovulation. The invention is thus particularly concerned with a method and apparatus for detecting or predicting the onset of ovulation in mammals, and more especially in humans, and moreover an ovulation prediction or detection apparatus that is portable and is simple to use on a day to day basis by a completely untrained and unskilled person. As is well known the onset of ovulation in humans and other mammals is accompanied by a number of physiological changes the monitoring of which can, with varying degrees of success, be used to detect or predict the onset of ovulation. In cattle, for example, numerous suggestions have been made for detection of oestrus by monitoring the physiological changes which take place in the vagina or in the vaginal secretions, and particularly changes in electrical resistance or conductivity of the cervical mucus. Merely as illustrative of such procedures there may be mentioned the papers published by L.B. Aizinbudas and P.P. Dovil tis in Zhivotnovodstro 1962 11 68 70 Schams, Schallenberger, Hoffman and Karg in Acta Edocrinologica 86 1977 180 192 Heckman, Katz, Foote, Oltenaan, Scott and Marshall in J. Dairy Science 1979 62 64 68 Carter and Dufty in Australian Veterinary Journal 1980 56 321 323 Edwards in Med. Biol. Eng. and Computing 1980 18 73 80 and Scipioni, Foote, Lamb, Hall, Lein and Shin in Cornell Vet. 1982 72 269 278 and also US A 3 844 276, US A 4 039 934 and US A 4 224949. So far as the prediction or detection of ovulation in humans is concerned a wide variety of approaches have likewise been tried ranging from simple physical measurements, e.g. temperature measurements, through electrometric methods to chemical and biochemical methods involving the assay of hormone levels, ATP levels etc., in various body fluids and secretions, with considerable concentration on the latter which are not suited to every day use in the home by an unskilled, untrained user. In the electrometric field, studies have tended to concentrate on potentiometric techniques which may be suitable for carrying out on a clinical basis but which are not readily adaptable for use on an individual basis. Such potentiometric techniques for the detection or prediction of ovulation in humans are described for example in US A 3 924 609 and in Human Ovulation, Ed. C.S. Keefer, published by J. A. Churchill Ltd. 1965 Chapter 4, pp 46 74. Studies of changes in the electrical conductivity of the squamous epithelium of the cervix uteri throughout the menstrual cycle have also been reported by Stiksa in Acta Universitatis, Carolinae Medica 1964 10 No. 2, 139 164. So far, however, research has failed to produce a simple, safe, reliable and easy to use ovulation predictor or detector such as can be used on a day to day basis in the home by an unskilled, untrained user to predict or detect ovulation, and hence establish the time when the chances of a conception are the highest, either as an aid to contraception or indeed as an aid to conception. The present invention seeks The known physical changes which occur in the cervical mucus at ovulation, i.e. the changes in viscosity, rate of flow, elasticity or stretchability and crystallinity are consistent with the hypothesis that the structural changes are attributable to the reversible breaking of disulfide S S bridges between the polypeptide molecules by an oxidation reduction reaction representable as FR A 2468648 describes a process for measuring bacterial growth by detecting changes in redox potential in a liquid nutrient medium inoculated with the bacterium, the changes in potential being measured in the form of the potential difference between a carbon electrode and a metal electrode. FR A 1220540 describes a process for measuring redox potentials in aqueous solution by a potentiometric technique and using a measuring electrode of a noble metal or carbon with a reference electrode such as a glass or calomel electrode. US Patent No. 4059406 describes an electrochemical detector having an electrochemical thin layer flow cell whose operation is based on the wall jet principle, in combination with a controller unit for applying a periodically changing voltage. GB 1402677 describes a method and apparatus for monitoring ovulation using a vaginal probe having two spaced apart electrodes for sensing the composition of vaginal fluids and developing a chosen plus or minus electrochemical potential polarity when the vaginal fluids are predominantly oxidising and an opposite electrochemical potential polarity when the vaginal fluids are predominantly reductive. The method described in GB 1402677 essentially requires metal electrodes and detects the potential difference between the electrodes as a result of galvanic action when they are placed in contact with the vaginal fluids. The apparatus is generally unacceptable for regular and long term use since metal ions will inevitably be released into the vaginal fluids from the electrodes with a consequent risk to the health of the subject. In addition the method and apparatus of GB 1402677 is generally not sufficiently sensitive, accurate and reliable. We have now discovered an improved method and apparatus for monitoring redox activity which can be used to detect e.g. any disturbance of normal physiological functioning. For example, we have found that ovulation can be reliably and easily detected Thus, according to the invention there is provided a method of monitoring changes of redox activity in a medium In another aspect, the invention provides apparatus for monitoring changes of redox activity The term non metallic is used herein to designate a material other than a metal The method and apparatus according to the invention are of particular applicability to the detection of ovulation. This may be achieved, in accordance with this invention, by inserting the probe into the vagina and monitoring the changes in the redox activity of the tissue or cervical mucus in the vicinity of the probe during the menstrual cycle. As indicated above, the method and apparatus according to the invention is not limited to the monitoring of redox activities in the vagina, but is applicable to any redox reaction in almost any environment into which the probe can be introduced. In general therefore the present invention provides a method of monitoring almost any redox reaction. In one particular arrangement the probe comprises two electrodes of non metallic material of which the surface admittance will vary with the redox activity of a medium in contact with the material, said members being electrically insulated one from the other. In a preferred embodiment, the non metallic electrodes are supported by a probe body of generally elongate form for insertion into the vagina and conveniently made from an electrically insulating material such as plastics. The electrodes of non metallic material of varying surface admittance are conveniently embedded in the probe body, desirably at a position such that they may contact the posterior fornix when the probe is inserted into the vagina. The non metallic material may be a non metallic semi conducting material, the surface admittance of which will vary with redox activity when in contact with a medium having redox activity. Examples of suitable semiconducting materials include doped silicon and preferably carbonaceous semiconducting materials such as carbon fibres or vitreous or glassy carbon. In general, the semiconducting material for Vitreous or glassy carbon has also been found to be particularly useful for the construction of the probe since it has been found that this material is especially sensitive to changes in redox activity, as well as exhibiting favourable biocompatibility. Means are conveniently provided for applying a transient or time varying potential, generally of low voltage e.g 50 500 mv , across the two members and to provide an indication of the electrochemical admittance of the probe, which is itself a function of the redox activity of the medium contacting the probe. The use of the dynamic application of potential to the electrodes facilitates the determination of surface admittance. The means to provide an indiction of the surface admittance of the probe may, for example, comprise means for detecting and analysing the resultant current between the members, or means for detecting changes in the frequency of an oscillator means connected with the members. In its simplest form the apparatus can be designed simply to display a value corresponding to the electrochemical admittance of the probe and which the user records on a daily basis. Just as a rise in the basal body temperature BBT can be used to indicate the onset of ovulation, so a drop in e.g. the measured current, indicating a decrease in the admittance of the probe, can be used to signal ovulation. In a more sophisticated arrangement the apparatus may include a memory for memorizing the daily values and for signalling automatically the onset of ovulation. As will be apparent the apparatus of the present invention can be of a very small compact size and readily portable, requiring only quite low power batteries for operation, and the largest item being the probe itself. For accuracy, measurements should be made regularly each day and at the same time of day. Also the user should, so far as possible, take readings with the probe in exactly the same position each day. For example, for best results in detecting ovulation, it has been found that measurements should be taken throughout the menstrual cycle with the distal end of the probe located in the region of the posterior fornix, a region which, with a little practice, the user can locate regularly and without difficulty. If desired, the apparatus according to the invention may include means for the detection of other physiological changes, e.g. changes in temperature, pH, chloride ion concentration or ATP concentration. Such means may be conveniently incorporated into the probe of the apparatus so that more than one physiological parameter can be measured at the same time. For example, in detecting ovulation greater accuracy may be achieved by monitoring both changes in redox activity and temperature during the menstrual cycle. The invention will be further described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figures 1a and 1b illustrate views of two ovulation predictor devices according to the invention, Figures 2a, 2b, 2c and 2d illustrate alternative probes for use with either of the devices of Figures 1a and 1b, Figure 3 is a schematic illustration of an electrical circuit connected to the probe, Figures 4 8 are graphs setting out results obtained using various probes constructed in accordance with this invention, and Figures 9 and 10 are two further electrical circuits usable with the probe. Referring to Figures 1a and 1b, the preferred application for apparatus in accordance with this invention is as an ovulation predictor or detector for human beings or animals. For these applications the apparatus comprises a vaginal probe body 1 shown in more detail in Figures 2a, 2b and 2c comprising a rigid or semi rigid cylindrical element approximately 10 cms in length and 1 cm in diameter for human use having a rounded distal end insertable into the vagina, with the distal end extending therein into the region of the posterior cervical fornix. As shown in the detail of Figures 2a, 2b, 2c and 2d, the probe body 1 supports two electrodes or elements 2, 3 of glassy vitreous carbon separated by or embedded in an insulating element 4 . The particular dimensions of the probe body will normally depend on its intended use. For example, where the probe is to be used with cattle, the probe body may be conveniently up to about 60 cms in length and about 3 cms in diameter. In Figure 2a, the probe comprises two hemispherical section glassy carbon electrodes 2, 3 separated by a planar insulating layer 4 , and in Figure 2b, the probe comprises a substantially circular section insulating member 4 having two diametrically opposed grooves in which are seated the two electrodes 2, 3 each in the form of a circular section rod of vitreous carbon. In Figure 2c, the two electrodes 2, 3 are positioned relatively closely over a generally small part of the probe body so as to enable measurement of changes in redox activity at selected points in the vagina. In Figure 2d, the two electrodes 2, 3 are in the form of rings. In one form of apparatus, shown in Figure 1a, there is connected to the probe by means of a suitably flexible and extensible lead 6 a housing 7 adapted to contain dry cell batteries to power the probe and containing the electronic circuitry described hereinafter in more detail and required to detect the change in surface admittance of the two vitreous carbon electrodes of the probe when in an oxidation reduction environment such as exists within the vagina. Also incorporated in the housing 7 is an appropriate visual display device 8 , which can be either an analogue or digital display, and which can be used to display any of a range of signals depending upon the simplicity or complexity of the device. Figure 1b shows an alternative form of the apparatus in which a housing 7 for a display device 8 and batteries is physically attached to the probe body 1 . This provides a very compact unit, but because of the greater difficulty of reading the display in this arrangement, an audio indicator 9 is preferably provided to produce an audible indication when a steady reading has been achieved. In the simplest case the display device of either version can simply be a digital or analogue display of the current output from the probe when Figure 3 shows an example of an electrical circuit for detecting changes in admittance at the probe 1 . The probe 1 and an alternating voltage source 12 are shown each connected between a reference point shown as earth and respectively inverting and non inverting inputs of an operational amplifier 14 . The output of the operational amplifier 14 is fed back to the inverting input via a feedback path comprising a selectable resistor 16 . If the resistance of the probe 1 is R Thus, since the admittance is inversely dependent on R For best results as an ovulation predictor the apparatus will be used by the user on a regular daily basis, preferably at the same time each day, e.g. first thing in the morning or last thing at night, and users will be recommended so far as possible to use the probe in exactly the same position on each occasion. Experimentally, the best results have been obtained using the probe twice daily, i.e. night and morning. In a series of trials carried out using a probe constructed in accordance with Figure 2c, a consistent pattern of results has been obtained illustrated by Figures 4 7. In each case the probe was used regularly last thing at night by a healthy adult female and a record made of the measured output from the probe µA at various energisation levels. For comparison with a recognised, albeit imperfect known method for the detection of ovulation, the subject also measured and recorded her basal body temperature BBT using a commercial clinical thermometer inserted under the tongue, these measurements being made first thing in the morning before rising. Figure 4 illustrates the results obtained in a first series of tests with the probe operating at 10 kHz and 100 mV. Figure 5 illustrates the results of two different series of tests with the probe operating at 10 kHz and 50 mV, and at 1 kHz and 300 mV. Figure 6 illustrates the results from two successive tests carried out during successive cycles and clearly demonstrates the reproducibility of the pattern in the data. In each case a clear correspondence is established between the output current from the probe and the BBT, the output current showing a distinct dip ovulation dip, O coincident with the rise in BBT which is known to occur at about the time of ovulation. Even more characteristically the output curves show a distinct peak immediately preceding ovulation, and which can be referred to as the prediction peak P . An idealised curve showing these two features, the prediction peak P and the ovulation dip O is shown in Figure 7, and the results obtained from monitoring the subject over 5 cycles are shown in Figure 8. These two features, the prediction peak P and the ovulation dip O are found to be quite characteristic of the output of the probes of this invention and it can be hypothesised that the ovulation dip O coincides with the known peak emission of luteinising hormone LH which is believed to initiate ovulation, whilst the predictor peak P can be indicative of an earlier hormonal change preceding the LH surge by 1 or 2 days. Indeed, the output from the probes of this invention shows a number of characteristic subsidiary peaks and dips both pre and post ovulation and which may provide further indications of other hormonal changes taking place in the body at various stages in the menstrual cycle. Further experimental work using various differently sized probes has also shown that the size and location of the probe may have a significant effect on the response. Thus it is found that probes having a configuration such that there is contact with the vagina over a wide area, and not just in the region of the posterior cervical fornix, show response curves still having the predictor peak PP but showing a wider ovulation trough, rather than a sharp dip at ovulation, which is characteristic of probes configured to contact the posterior cervical fornix. Figure 9 shows a circuit which is particularly useful for experimental work involving changes in frequency and voltage of the alternating input signal. The probe 1 is again connected to the inverting input of an operational amplifier 85 , but in this case the non inverting input is connected to earth. A resistor 86 is connected in the feedback path between output and inverting input of the operational amplifier 85 . The alternating voltage is derived from a waveform generator 80 fed to the probe 1 via a buffer amplifier 84 . RMS converters 89, 87 receive respectively the input voltage to the probe 1 and the output voltage of the amplifier 85 , and provide voltages which are the root mean squares of the respective alternating voltages. The outputs of the RMS converters 89, 87 are fed to a divider 88 . A frequency to voltage converter 81 receives the output of generator 80 and itself provides an output A. Outputs B, C and D are derived from the RMS converters 87, 89 and the divider 88 respectively. The outputs A, B, C and D can be selectively connected via a switch 82 to a digital voltmeter 83 . The divider 88 divides E Figure 10 is a more detailed circuit diagram of a detection circuit suitable for use with the apparatus according to the invention. It will be seen that the configuration of probe 1 and operational amplifier 42 is broadly similar to that of Figures 3 and 9, but with respect to the latter, the Figure 10 circuit only provides an indication of the output voltage and hence probe admittance no other test voltages are to be measured. The operation of the Figure 10 circuit is similar to that previously described and will not be described in detail. Another significant feature of the detection aspect as previously described is that the obtained response using the probes of the present invention is a drop in current output, not an increase, which was to be expected had the known preovulation increase in conductivity of the cervical mucus have been a major factor in the function of the probe of the present invention. Thus the decrease in output current is consistent with the hypothesis that it is variations in the surface admittance of the material of the probe in response to changing redox potentials in the cervical mucus that provides the A further generally important feature of the invention, particularly so far as Thus the present invention is believed to provide a completely safe, aesthetically acceptable and effective portable apparatus for the prediction and detection of ovulation in humans and animals, and which can be used effectively by unskilled, untrained users. In addition to the prediction and detection of ovulation in humans and animals, it is also believed that the method and apparatus of the present invention may be used
