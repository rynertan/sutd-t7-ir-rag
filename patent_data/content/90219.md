# Memory system restructured by deterministic permutation algorithm.

## Abstract
Swapping of physical bits between different logical words of a memory 40 is accomplished by reference to data 46 on bad bits in the memory. Different permutation data 34 are selected to control address inputs to each bit position 12i in a memory word so that any word with multiple uncorrectable data is changed to a correctable logical data word by placing one or more of the bad bits in the original word into another word of the memory. The swapping is done by an exclusionary process 48 which identifies and deselects certain deleterious potential com binations of actual addresses thereby limiting the selection process to ohter combinations. The process can involve categorizing 44 of failures in accordance with type, and performing 48 algorithm operations which identify com binations of bit addresses that would result in combining the failures so that there are more errors in any memory word than would be correctable by the error correction code monitoring 42 the memory.
