# Bearing material and method of making the said bearing material.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to an improved composite bearing material which includes polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE . The composite bearing material comprises three lay ers 1 a metal backing 12 , which will normally be a low car bon steel and which may be plated such as with nickel plating 18 or the like, 2 a porous metal interlayer 14 , which may comprise bronze or other copper alloys, on said metal back ing, and 3 a PTFE based composition 16 formulated to have good wear resistance. In accordance with the method of the present invention, the porous metal interlayer substantially comprises a relatively non homogeneous mixture of particles from two distinct particle size ranges, wherein a substantial portion of the relatively fine powder is segregated adjacent the metal backing. In addition, the PTFE based composition which is impregnated into the porous metal interlayer in accordance with the present invention comprises from about 2 to about 10 by volume of at least one material selected from the group consisting of tin bronze and other copper alloys, as well as mixtures thereof from about 5 to about 30 by volume of at least one material selected from the group consisting of metal lic lead, metallic cadmium, an oxide of lead, and an oxide of cadmium, as well as mixtures thereof from about 5 to about 30 by volume of at least one material selected from the group consisting of natural graphite and artificial graphite, as well as mixture thereof with the remainder comprising polytetrafluor oethylene. The present invention also relates to a method of making a tape suitable for impregnation into a porous metal matrix.
