# Improvements in or relating to piezoelectric materials and to methods for producing such materials.

## Abstract
The piezoelectric properties of a polymeric material, for example polyvinylidene may be enhanced by poling , which usually involves the application to the material, whilst at an elevated temperature, of a high voltage electric field. The enhancement is however limited by the temperature and electric field that the material can tolerate. Further enhancement is obtained by exposing the material 1 to a quantity of Î³ radiation 4 of between 1 and 200 Mrads before poling best results are obtained at an exposure level of between 1 and 100 Mrads. The treated material is suitable for use in microphone transmitters, receivers and pressure transducers.
