# Adaptive gas turbine acceleration control.

## Abstract
An acceleration schedule, from which data is derived for use in calculating fuel flow during acceleration of a gas turbine engine, is modified each time the engine surges so as to avoid future surges. The engine 10 includes a gas generator having a compressor and the method comprises storing data 32 com prising an engine acceleration schedule which defines a ratio of the rate of change of gas generator speed to compressor discharge pressure for ratios of gas generator speed to com pressor inlet temperature during acceleration storing modifier values which correspond to the acceleration schedule data detecting engine surges 22 varying at least that stored modifier value which corresponds to the data point on the ac celeration schedule at which a surge has occurred during one acceleration and combining 36 the acceleration schedule data with the modifier values whereby the schedule value will be varied during accelerations occurring subsequent to the said one acceleration.
