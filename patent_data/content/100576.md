# Method of analysing the voltage induced in an exciter coil of a stepping motor.

## Abstract
A method is described for analysing the voltage induced in an exciter coil 1 of a stepping motor. After energization the exciter coil 1 is loaded by a low impedance 5 so that the induction voltage can produce a current. Subsequently, it is attempted to maintain the current through said coil equal to zero by periodically connecting said coil to a positive or negative voltage 4 . The pattern of consecutive polarities of these periodic energizations is analysed.
