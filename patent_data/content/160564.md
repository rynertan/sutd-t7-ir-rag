## Description
This invention relates to improvements in or relating to cephalosporins. More particularly it relates to processes for the preparation of the cephalosporin antibiotic ceftazidime. Ceftazidime 6R,7R 7 Z 2 2 aminothiazol 4 yl 2 2 carboxyprop 2 oxyimino acetamido 3 1 pyridiniummethyl ceph 3 em 4 carboyylate is a valuable antibiotic having broad spectrum activity, in particular, unusually high activity against gram negative organisms, including Semi synthetic cephalosporins may conventionally be prepared by the acylation of an appropriate 7 aminocephalosporin with a compound serving to introduce a preformed 7 substituent, or by modification at the 3 position, for example the reaction of a 3 acyloxymethyl or 3 halomethylcephalosporin with a nucleophile, to introduce the desired 3 substituent. These general processes are described in U.K. Patent No. 2025398 for the preparation of ceftazidime. We have now devised a process for the preparation of ceftazidime, and salts and protected derivatives thereof in which the 2 carboxyprop 2 yl moiety in the 7 substituent of ceftazidime is introduced as the last major chemical step in the synthesis, by an etherification reaction. According to one aspect of the invention, therefore, we provide a process for the preparation of compounds of general formula I wherein R¹ represents an amino or protected amino group, R² is hydrogen or a carboxyl blocking group, B is S or S O and the dotted line indicates that the compound is a ceph 2 em or ceph 3 em compound or a corresponding compound having at the 4 position a group of formula COOR³ where R³ is a carboxyl blocking group and having an associated anion A wherein R¹, B and the dotted line are as defined above or a corresponding compound having a group of formula COOR³ at the 4 position wherein R³ is as defined above together with an associated anion A Such an agent being a compound of formula III where Y is a leaving group, in particular a halogen e.g. chloro, bromo or iodo sulphate or a hydrocarbylsulphonyloxy, e.g. methanesulphonyloxy or p toluenesulphonyloxy group, and R² is as defined above in the presence of a base selected from an alkali metal carbonate e.g. sodium, potassium or lithium carbonate , hydride e.g. sodium, potassium or lithium t butoxide , dialkylamide e.g. lithium diisopropylamide or a disilylamide. The anion A The etherification reaction may be effected in an organic medium, conveniently at a temperature in the range 50 to 100 C, preferably 0 50 C. Examples of reaction media which may be employed include ethers, e.g. cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxan or acylic ethers such as diethyl ether or diglyme amides such as N,N dimethylformamide, N,N dimethylacetamide or hexamethylphosphoramide lower ketones such as acetone nitriles such as acetonitrile nitroalkanes such as nitromethane sulphoxides such as dimethylsulphoxide sulphones such as sulpholane hydrocarbons, such as benzene or hexane and esters such as ethyl acetate, as well as mixtures of such solvents. The reaction medium may contain some water, but is preferably anhydrous. The etherification is carried out in the presence of an agent serving to generate an anion from the hydroxime function, and or as an acid binding agent, i.e. a base selected from the group listed above. If the compound of formula II is employed in the form of an acid addition salt, the base should be present in sufficient quantity to neutralize rapidly the acid in question. The etherification reaction may be effected in a single liquid phase or a two liquid phase reaction medium. When a two phase system is used the reaction is generally carried out in the presence of the base e.g. an alkali metal carbonate or an alkali metal hydroxide together with a phase transfer reagent, such as a crown ether i.e. a macrocyclic polyether . The crown ether may contain for example a number of ethyleneoxy units, which may be substituted, e.g. by phenyl or cyclohexyl groups joined to form a ring. Examples of such a reagent include 18 crown 6 containing 6 ethyleneoxy units e.g. dibenzo or dicyclohexyl 18 crown 6, and 15 crown 5 containing 5 ethyleneoxy units . A preferred two phase medium is water dichloromethane. The etherification reaction may be followed where necessary and or desired by conversion of the compound of formula I initially obtained into a different compound of formula I , for example by means of one or more of the following reactions These reactions may be effected by conventional methods, and in any convenient order. Thus, if desired, a Δ² cephalosporin obtained in accordance with the process of the invention may be converted into the corresponding Δ³ derivative by, for example, treatment of the Δ² ester with a base, such as pyridine or triethylamine. A ceph 2 em reaction product may also be oxidised to yield the corresponding ceph 3 em 1 oxide, for example by reaction with a peracid, e.g. peracetic or m chloroperbenzoic acid the resulting sulphoxide may subsequently be reduced as described hereinafter to yield the corresponding ceph 3 em sulphide. Where a compound of formula I is obtained in which B is S O this may, if desired, be converted into the corresponding sulphide by, for example, reduction of the corresponding acyloxysulphonium or alkoxysulphonium salt prepared Carboxyl blocking groups which may be present in the compounds of general formula I or any of the intermediates described herein may be any of the conventional carboxyl protecting groups known in the art, a list of representative protected carboxyl groups being included in British Patent No. 1399086. The carboxyl blocking group may be for example the residue of an ester forming aliphatic or araliphatic alcohol or an ester forming phenol, silanol or stannanol preferably containing 1 20 carbon atoms. Thus, carboxyl blocking groups which may conveniently be employed include aryl lower alkyl groups, such as p methoxybenzyl, p nitrobenzyl and diphenylmethyl lower alkyl groups such as t butyl lower haloalkyl groups such as 2,2,2 trichloroethyl and tri lower alkyl silyl groups such as trimethylsilyl. An amino protecting group present in the compounds of formula I or intermediates therefor is conveniently a group which may be readily removed at an appropriate stage in the reaction sequence, for example an aralkyl group, such as triphenylmethyl, or an acyl group, such as formyl, t butoxycarbonyl, 2,2,2 trichloroethoxycarbonyl, isoamyloxycarbonyl or chloroacetyl. Any carboxyl blocking or amino protecting group present in the compound of formula I may be removed, if desired, by any appropriate methods known in the art. Suitable methods for removing carboxyl protecting groups include acid or base hydrolysis and reduction. Thus, for example, diphenylmethyl and t butyl carboxyl blocking groups may conveniently be removed by acid hydrolysis. A p nitrobenzyl group may conveniently be cleaved by reduction, effected for example by zinc and acetic acid, or sodium dithionite or iodide ion in water conveniently in the presence of a water miscible solvent such as acetone, tetrahydrofuran, dioxan, dimethylformamide or dimethylacetamide. Methods of removing amino protecting groups are also well known in the art. A trityl group may for example be removed using an optionally halogenated carboxylic acid e.g. acetic acid, formic acid, chloroacetic acid or trifluoroacetic acid or using a mineral acid, e.g. hydrochloric acid or mixtures of such acids, preferably in the presence of a protic solvent such as water. Acid labile acyl amino protecting groups, e.g. formyl, t butoxycarbonyl or isoamyloxycarbonyl may also be removed, where appropriate under the conditions described above for a trityl group. Other acyl amino protecting groups e.g. 2,2,2 trichloroethoxycarbonyl may be removed, for example, by reduction. It will be appreciated that the use of amino protecting and carboxyl blocking groups is well known in the art. Relevant examples of such use are given in e.g. Theodora W. Greene Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis Wiley Interscience, New York 1981 , and J.F.W. McOmie, Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry Plenum Press, London 1973 . Salt derivatives of the compounds of formula I include inorganic base salts such as alkali metal salts e.g. sodium and potassium salts and alkaline earth metal salts e.g. calcium and magnesium salts ammonium salts amino acid salts e.g. lysine and arginine salts organic base salts e.g. procaine, phenylethylbenzylamine, dibenzylethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine and N methylglucosamine salts , and acid addition salts, e.g. formed with a mineral acid such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulphuric, nitric or phosphoric acid, or with an organic acid such as formic, acetic, trifluoroacetic, methanesulphonic or p toluenesulphonic acid. The salts may also be in the form of resinates formed with, for example, a polystyrene resin or cross linked polystyrene divinylbenzene copolymer resin containing amino or quaternary amino groups or sulphonic acid groups, or with a resin containing carboxyl groups, e.g. a polyacrylic acid resin. It will be appreciated that when the compound of formula I prepared according to the invention is ceftazidime itself, salt and ester derivatives should be non toxic and physiologically acceptable, such as are described in UK Patent Specification No. 2025398. Base salts of formula I may be formed by reacting an acid of formula I with an appropriate base. Thus, for example, sodium or potassium salts may be prepared using the respective 2 ethylhexanoate or hydrogen carbonate salt. Acid addition salts may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula I with the appropriate acid. The reaction product may be separated from the reaction mixture, which may contain, for example, unchanged cephalosporin starting material and other substances, by a variety of processes including solvent extraction, recrystallisation, ionophoresis, column chromatography and use of ion exchangers for example by chromatography on ion exchange resins or macroreticular resins. Where a compound of formula I is obtained as a mixture of isomers, the A preferred embodiment of the invention relates to the preparation of ceftazidime or a protected derivative thereof, i.e., the compound of formula I in which R¹ represents an amino or protected amino group, R² represents hydrogen or an esterifying group, B represents S, and the dotted line represents a ceph 3 em compound, followed if desired by removal of the protecting and or esterifying groups, optionally A compound of formula II may be prepared, for example, by acylating a compound of formula IV wherein B and the dotted line are as defined above or a corresponding compound having at the 4 position a group COOR³, and an associated anion A wherein R¹ has the meaning defined for formula I and R⁴ represents hydrogen or a hydroxyl protecting group , or an acylating agent corresponding thereto, followed by removal of the group R⁴, when this represents a hydroxyl protecting group. The hydroxy protecting group will preferably be one which is readily removed under mild conditions and examples of such groups include acyl groups such as t butoxy carbonyl, 2,2,2 trichloroethoxycarbonyl and benzyloxycarbonyl silyl groups such as trimethylsilyl a tetrahydropyranyl or methoxytetrahydropyranyl group or a methoxyisopropyl group. The acylation reaction may be effected by conventional methods, for example as described in British Patent No. 2025398. Thus acylating agents corresponding to the acid of formula V which may be employed include acid halides, e.g. acid chlorides or bromides, activated esters, and symmetrical or mixed anhydrides. Acylation may also be effected using an acid of formula V , in which case a condensing agent such as N,N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, carbonyldiimidazole or N ethyl 5 phenylisoxazolium perchlorate, is desirably present in the reaction mixture. Alternatively, an activated form of an acid of formula V for use in the acylation reaction may be formed The acylation reaction may conveniently be effected in a suitable solvent or mixture of solvents, such as an alcohol e.g. aqueous ethanol or aqueous industrial methylated spirit at temperatures from 50 to 50 C, if desired in the presence of an acid binding agent. Compounds of formula IV may be prepared as described in British Patent Specification No. 2,025,398 and compounds of formula V may be prepared as described in British Patent Specification No. 1,587,941.
