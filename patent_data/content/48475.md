# Transversal equalizer.

## Abstract
A transversal equalizer has a transversal filter 13, 14, 16 which performs a convolution of an unequalized signal and a tap weight. In the automatic equalization mode, the tap weight is updated according to the result of a correlation of the unequalized signal and an error signal, and the updated tap weight is applied to the transversal filter 13, 14, 16 . In the fixed equalization mode, a fixed tap weight stored in a memory 27 is applied to the transversal filter 13, 14, 16 .
