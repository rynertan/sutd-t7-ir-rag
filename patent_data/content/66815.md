# Power unit mount.

## Abstract
A power unit mount comprises a generally T shaped elastomeric member between an outer member and an inner member. The generally T shaped elastomeric member has two armed portions and a leg portion. Upon application of a static load due to the weight of a power unit, the leg portion is compressed and the arm portions lie in the horizontal plane.
