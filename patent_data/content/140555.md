# Apparatus for displaying images defined by a plurality of lines of data.

## Abstract
Text is displayed on a VDU 23 using a character generator 26 and a generator 27 for attributes such as underline, enhanced brightness and so on. The codes for the generators are stored in a page store 29 . Two auxiliary memories 35 and 36 are used to store vectors. These memories are used in alternate raster scans to control the display, the unused memory being updated for the next raster scan. Each vector comprises an entry for every VDU scanning line and determines which dot video line signal will be used in that scanning line by specifying the data row address in the page memory 29 and the dot matrix row number to be used by the generators 26 and 27 . Such vectors enable complete control over the display for the purpose of defining windows, scrolling the display smoothly and slowly at the rate of one scanning line per frame and smooth expansion of a strip on the display by duplication of lines. A CPU 10 effects the control by determining the vectors written into the auxiliary memories. For graphics display, the vectors store for each scanning line the number of the bit line to be used in creating the image.
