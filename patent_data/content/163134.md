# Method and apparatus for controlling air fuel ratio in internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
In an internal combustion engine wherein feedback control of the air fuel ratio is carried out in accordance with the concentration of a specific composition in the exhaust gas, so that the air fuel ratio is close to an aimed air fuel ratio on the lean side with respect to the stoichimetric air fuel ratio, the aimed air fuel ratio is variable in accordance with the engine temperature.
