# Tubular polymerization reactor, and process for polymerization.

## Abstract
A tubular polymerization reactor 4 comprises a feed opening 8 for a polymerizable material at one end portion, a withdrawal opening 6 for the resultant polymer at the other end portion, a tubular reaction space within the reactor 4 extending from said feed opening 8 to said withdrawal open ing 6 , and a rotary 3 disposed within the reaction space and extending therealong with some clearance from the inner wall surface of the polymerization reactor 4 characterized in that i the length to diameter ratio â„“
