# Electrostriction transducer comprising electrostriction layers of axially varied thicknesses.

## Abstract
In an electrostriction transducer comprising protection layers 21, 22 in which no electric fields are produced during operation, each of end electrostriction layers 41, 42 which are contiguous to the respective protection layers with pertinent ones of internal electrodes 16, 17 interposed, is given a thicker thickness at as compared with other or intermediate electrostriction layers 23 to make the trans ducer have a long life and a high reliability. The intermediate electrostriction layers may have a common thickness t . Alternatively, the intermediate electrostriction layers may have monotonously decreasing thicknesses when placed nearer to a plane which bisects a pile 19 of the electrostric tion layers parallel to both end surfaces of the pile. When a pair of holding members for the transducer are used on both longitudinal ends, each protection layer is preferably re ceived in an indent formed in the holding member. Alterna tively, it is preferred that each holding member should comprise a metal plate contiguous to the protection layer and a metal band surrounding parts of the metal plate and the protection layer.
