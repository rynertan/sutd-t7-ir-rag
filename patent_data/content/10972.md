## Description
FLOWABLE EIERBICIDES CONTAINING 2 HALOACETANILIDES AND APROCESS FOR THEIR PREPARATION The invention herein pertains to the field of flowable herbicides, materials and processes for preparation thereof. In particular, flowable herbicides comprising acetanilides, e.g., propachlor, and mixtures thereof with triazines, e.g., atrazine, and appropriate emulsifying suspending agents, solvents and carriers are disclosed. Description of the Prior Art The prior art with respect to herbicides comprises wettable powders WP s emulsifiable concentrates E.C. s , granules and flowable formulations which may be prepared as package mixes or tank mixes. As relevant to the present invention which pertains to flowable herbicides comprising certain 2 haloacetanilides alone or in combination with certain s triazines,the prior art describes a variety of formulations in the above forms. For example, U. S. Re Patent No. 26,961 original Patent No.2,863,752 and U. S. Patents 3,442,945 and 3,547,620 describe various 2 haloacetanilides, e.g., propachlor, alachlor, butachlor, etc., which may be used alone or in admixture with herbicides including various triazines, including s triazines.U. S. Patents 2,891,855 and 2,909,420 describe various triazines, e.g., atrazine, and Canadian Patent No. 847,250 refers to the combination of certain s triazines with alachlor in various forms , e.g., solutions, emulsions, suspensions, or dusts. However, this patent does not give any details as to the materials except active ingredients or processes for producing any of these forms of formulations. In addition to the above patent literature, there are commercial formulations of flowable propachlor and flowable atrazine which are applied as tank mixes. The above prior art, the most relevant known to the inventors, is devoid of any disclosure or other description of a unitary flowable herbicide comprising a 2 haloacetanilide, e.g., propachlor or alachlor, and an s triazine, e.g., atrazine. The commercial flowable propachlor and flowable atrazine mentioned above are each of proprietary composition, hence, unknown to the inventors. In addition, these flowable herbicides must be prepared separately, packaged separately, transported and stored in separate containers and used as a tank mix. As will be shown below, the flowable propachlor of this invention has superior properties as an independent flowable herbicide, i.e., having only one active ingredient, vis a vis said commercial flowable propachlor. Problems. associated with prior art forms of acetanilide and or s triazine formulations include the need to convert wettable powder forms of these solid materials into slurries to be used by the farmer in preparing tank mixes for application to the soil. The preparation of slurries of wettable powders of some herbicides, e.g., of prominent note is propachlor, presents certain safety hazards and inconveniences due to the generation of noxious dusts which are irritable to the skin and hazardous to breathe. In addition, wettable powders of propachlor and atrazine when prepared as tank mixes do not disperse well., have poorer spontaneity of bloom , have lower suspensibility, poor redispersibility and poorer compatibility with liquid fertilizers than do liquid formulations such as emulsifiable concentrates and flowable formulations. Water based flowable herbicides have advantages over emulsifiable concentrates since the latter generally required organic solvents which are usually flammable and or of toxic composition, hazardous to the skin or from vapors evolved therefrom. Flowable herbicides do not suffer the usual disadvantages of wettable powders, dusts and emulsifiable concentrates mentioned above, are easier to prepare and use and have the same, and sometimes superior, herbicidal efficacy and crop safety as older forms of formulation mentioned above. Moreover, flowable herbicides generally, and in the present invention specifically, have superior properties with respect to suspensibility, viscosity, bloom, redispersibility, stability e.g., shelf life and temperature cycling and compatibility with liquid fertilizers. It is a particular advantage of the present invention to provide a combination flowable herbicide comprising a 2haloacetanilide and an s triazine, e.g., flowable propachlor and atrazine, which may be prepared, transported, stored and used as a one container herbicide having none of the disadvantages of prior art herbicides and all of the advantages mentioned hereinabove. As used herein and in the art a flowable herbicide denotes a suspension of solid particles in a liquid carrier. Summary of the Invention This invention relates to flowable herbicides comprising certain 2 haloacetanilides as the sole active ingredient or in combination with certain s triazines and to a process for preparing these herbicides. In more particular, this invention pertains to flowable herbicides having the following composition by weight a from 25 to 50 of a 2 haloacetanilide having the formulaEMI3.1 wherein R, R1 and R2 are C16 alkyl, alkoxy or alkoxyalkyl groups, R3 is hydrogen, C18 alkyl, alkenyl, akynyl or alkoxy radicals, X is chloro, bromo or iodo and n is an integer from 0 3 inclusive b from 0 to 15 of an s triazine having the formulaEMI4.1 wherein X1 is chloro, bromo or iodo, R4 and R5 are independently hydrogen or lower alkyl c an emulsifier suspension system for components a and b comprising i hydrated amorphous silicon dioxide 2 8 ii polyoxypropylene polyoxyethylene 2 8 block copolymer iii lower alkyl substituted C 10 alkyne 0 28 diol or ethyl ester thereof and iv hydrated aluminum silicate 0 5 28 d an inert, low freezing point 5 15 solvent compatible with components c i iv e defoamer, and 0 0.1 f an inert liquid carrier for com 30 70 ponents a e , the solid components of said composition having a particle size no greater than 25 microns. In preferred embodiments of this invention, the flowable herbicide comprises propachlor, i.e., 2 chloro N isopropyl acetanilide, as the sole active ingredient or in combination with atrazine, i.e., 2 chloro 4 ethylamino 6 isopropylamino s triazine. VIhen used alone, propachlor is present in a preferred concentration of from about 35 48 by weight of the flowable herbicide, and in more preferred embodiments from 40 46t, whereas in combination with atrazine, the concentration of propachlor is reduced generally by the amount of added atrazine, which preferably is present in an amount of from 5 15 and more preferably within the range of about 10 15 , the amount of active ingredients depending upon the particular weed spectrum to be treated. The active ingredients in the flowable herbicides of this invention are maintained in an emulsification suspension system comprising a unique and critical combination of 1 hydrated amorphous silicas exemplified by products similar to trade named Hi Sil, e.g., Hi Sil 233 or Zeofree 80 2 aqueous alcoholic solutions of polyoxypropylene polyoxyethylene P.O.P. P.O.E. block copolymers, trade namedPluraflo, e.g., Pluraflo E4 and ES, having molecular weights on the order of 6500 3 lower alkyl substituted alkyne diols, trade name Surfynol exemplified by dimethyl octynediol Surfynol 82 , tetramethyl decynediol Surfynol 104 and the ethoxylated esters thereof, e.g., Surfynol 465 and Surfynol 485 10 moles and 30 moles respectively of ethoxylatedSurfynol 104 and 4 a hydrated aluminum silica, such as kaolin and the like.An inert, low freezing point solvent, e.g., polyglycols, which are compatible with said emulsification suspension system and with water is also used. Preferably, a defoamer such as a 10 solution of Corak 100, a non aqueous silicone antifoam compound having 100 silicone solids, is used, but is not critical and, finally, the balance of the flowable composition is made up with water. The novel flowable herbicides of this invention were only made possible by discovery and development of a novel process. In particular, the process of this invention involves mixing the relevant components in appropriate quantities in a pre grind operation in order to blend the ingredients and obtain a suitable solids particle size distribution and facilitate the final wet grinding operation. A preferred particle size distribution is as follows 95 less than 48 microns 75 less than 35.5 microns 50 less than 23 microns and 25 less than 13 microns. The final grinding operation may be conducted in vertical or horizontal media mills using stainless steel, ceramic or other ball grinding materials which are inert with respect to the reaction components.Critical parameters in the final wet grind operation are that the temperature be maintained below about 200C and the grinding or milling operation continued until the solids particle size distribution is as follows 95 less than 20 microns 75 less than 10 microns 50 less than 5 microns and 25 less than 2.5 microns. In preferred flowable herbicide embodiments the solids particle size distribution is as follows 95 less than 4.5 microns 75 less than 2.8 microns, 50 less than 2.4 microns and 25 less than 1.9 microns. Preferred 2 haloacetanilides according to the above formula are solids. When liquid 2 haloacetanilides are used, it is unnecessary to use the clay kaolin and hydrated silicon dioxide Hi Sil 233 components in the emulsification suspension system, other surfactants and gels may be used to suspend the liquid active ingredient. Of primary interest and preference herein is the use of propachlor either alone or in combination with an s triazine. Other preferred 2 haloacetanilides according to the above structural formula include those wherein the R members are independently hydrogen, C15 lower alkyl or alkoxy groups exemplary of such compounds, e.g., alachlor, etc., are enumerated in the above mentionedU. S.Patent Numbers 3,442,945 and 3,547,620. Preferred s triazines are those according to the above formula wherein the R4 and R5 members are hydrogen and C14 lower alkyl. In particular, the triazine of primary interest is atrazine and related compounds within the above formula, esp. simazine, i.e., 2 chloro 4,6 bis ethylam no s triazine, and propazine, i.e., 2 chloro 4,6 bis isopropylamino s triazine, and the like. Detailed Description of the Invention Example 1 This example describes a preferred embodiment of the invention for preparing a flowable herbicide containing propachlor as the active ingredient.

The mixture is sampled for assay any necessary adjustments are made based on the sample analysis. The pre ground mixture is then pumped to a surge tank, thence fed to a horizontal media mill, e.g., a DynoMill, at a throughput volume of 7 liters hour, while maintaining the temperature at about 180 200C. Solids in the formulation leaving the media mill had a particle size distribution as follows 95 less than 4.5 microns 752 less than 2.8 microns 50 less than 2.4 microns and 25 less than 1.9 microns. Example 2 Following the same procedures described in Example 1, but adding atrazine containing small amounts, e.g., from 0.5 5.0 , of atrazine related compounds, i.e., homologs such as propazine and simazine, the following flowable formulation was prepared PercentComponent Lb Gal Kg L 5 Gal L By Weight Propachlor 95 3.20 0.38 16.00 60.56 33.605Atrazine 97 1.06 0.13 5.30 20.06 11.195Hi Sil 233 .38 0.05 1.90 7.19 4.00Kaolin .10 0.01 0.50 1.89 1.00Plurflo 5E .38 0.05 1.90 7.19 4.00Ethylene glycol .75 0.09 3.74 14.16 8.00Corak 100 .002 0.0002 0.01 0.04 0.02Water 3.620 0.43 18.10 68.51 38.18 9.50 1.14 47.45 179.60 100.00The solids particle sizing of this formulation had the same distribution as in Example 1. Similar flowable formulations as the above having varying amounts of active ingredients have also been prepared in vertical media mills, called attritors. In any case, the essential criteria are that the process cooling temperatures be maintained at or below about 200C, formulation assay be maintained at the correct composition and that the solids particle size be maintained below about 48 50 microns in the pre mix and below 25 microns, preferably below 20 microns and still more preferably below 5 microns, i.e., according to the size distribution shown in Example 1. Example 3 In order to illustrate the relative performance and superior physical properties of the flowable herbicides of this invention vis a vis the most closely related herbicides of the prior art, tests were conducted to determine the relative bloom and redispersability of these formulations the results of these tests are tabulated in Table 1 below. The test procedures are as follows a weighed amount of the herbicidal formulation 20 grams is poured into a 250 ml glass stoppered graduate containing 230 cc of standard hard water through a 6 ml glass powder funnel. The degree of spontaneous emulsification bloom is observed.The criteria for judging bloom is as follows Perfect a thick emulsion cloud descending to the bottom of the graduate without separation of any type Good thin bloom with no separation or thick bloom with minor separation such as emulsion trailing at 2 or less from the bottom of the graduate and Poor . an emulsion cloud containing droplets breaking from the emulsion at the half way point between the surface and bottom of the graduate no oil droplets throughout bloom at 1 from bottom of graduate. The property of redispersability is determined by inverting the stoppered graduated cylinder until all separated material is resuspended observations are made typically after 0.5, 1.0 and 24 hours. The number of inversions required for complete redispersion is a measure of the degree of redispersability of the herbicidal formulation. In Table 1, the numbers under the Redispersability column refer to the number of inversions required to effect resuspension of the respective herbicide formulations. The letter symbols under the Formulation column refer to formulations identified as follows A. Flowable propachlor according to this invention containing 4 lb gal 0.48 kg l of propachlor B. Flowable propachlor commercially available under the trade name Bexton 4L also containing 4 lb gal of propachlor. C.

It has been found that tested flowable herbicidal formulations of this invention display excellent suspensibility and redispersability in high salt solutions such as nitrogen or other fertilizer solutions when used as a tank mix. For example, Formulations A and C in Table I were found to be compatible in a fertilizer solution comprising ammonium nitrate 38.8 , urea 31.0 and water 30.2 . On the other hand, these formulations, as well as the other formulations inTable 1 , displayed floculation when tested in high phosphorus fertilizer solutions having nitrogen phosphorus potassium ratios of 1 3 1. The flowable herbicide formulations of this invention have particular utility in corn and sorghum in which the crop safety and herbicidal efficacy are equivalent to wettable powder tank mixes currently in use. In comprehensive field tests comparing preferred propachlor and propachlor atrazine flowable formulations with wettable formulations it has been found that there are no significant differences in weed control, crop safety or yield between these herbicide formulations.Typical of such field tests are illustrated in the following examples. Example 4 A flowable propachlor atrazine formulation corresponding to that described in Example 2 and a comparable wettable powder WP propachlor atrazine tank mix were tested in sorghum against redroot pigweed RPW , puncture vine PV , crabgrass CG and barnyardgrass BYG . The respective herbicide formulations were applied pre emergence at 3.32 lb A 3.72 kg Ha for the flowable and 3.34 lb A 3.81 kg Ha for the wettable powder on sandy loam soil.Observations were taken at 28 days and 58 days after treatment DAT and the following results noted expressed in terms of percent injury to the indicated plants Formulation Percent Injury DAT Sorghum, RPW, PV, CG, BYGFlowable propachlor atrazine 4 78 62 92 92 28 0 75 72 82 85 58 wp propachlor 4 78 62 92 92 28 atraz ine 0 80 83 80 83 58 Example 5 This example illustrates tests with flowable propachlor atrazine according to Example 2 and a comparable tank mix of wettable powder propachlor atrazine in corn against various grasses and lambsquarter LBQ .

As indicated above the primary benefits of the flowable herbicides of this invention relate to the elimination of noxious fumes and dusts, improved bloom and redispersability, while maintaining crop safety and efficacy comparable to analogous herbicide formulations of the prior art. In addition, the flowable herbicides herein provide the convenience and economy of a one container formulation i.e., there is no necessity to buy, transport, store, measure and mix the components of two or more containers.
