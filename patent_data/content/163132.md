# A semiconductor memory device comprising a matrix of six transistor memory cells with a pair of CMOS inverters.

## Abstract
The gate electrode 22a of a first CMOS inverter is connected to the drains 18b, 18d of each transistor of a second CMOS inverter via an interconnection 28b , and the gate electrode 22b of the second CMOS inverter is con nected to the drains 18a, 18c of the first CMOS inverter via an interconnection 28b , to form a flip flop circuit. A pair of transfer transistors Qn13, Qn14 are connected to the nodes of this flip flop circuit. A plurality of memory cells each constituted by the flip flop circuit and the pair of transfer transistors are integrated in a matrix form to form a semiconductor memory device. The pair of gate electrodes 22a, 22b are formed of a first polycrystal line silicon layer which includes an impurity of the first conductivity type. The pair of interconnections 28a, 28b are formed of an impurity doped second polycrystalline silicon layer 32a, 32b, 34a, 34b and a high melting point metal layer 36a, 36b and formed on a first interlayer insulation film. The high melting point metal layer is provided to prevent an increase in the resistance value due to the formation of a pn junction formed by the interconnections.
