## Description
Technetium 99m Tc 99m is the favoured radionuclide for organ imaging and other forms of This invention relates to a complex of Technetium 99m useful as a diagnostic pharmaceutical, and capable of crossing the blood brain barrier and being retained in the brain for a time to permit diagnosis. European Patent Specification 123504 provides a lipophilic macrocyclic complex of Technetium 99m useful as a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical which can be formed by complexing in aqueous solution Tc 99m pertechnetate under reducing conditions with an alkylene amine oxime containing 2 or 3 carbon atoms in the alkylene group, which group is unsubstituted or substituted, the complex having a core with a zero net charge, containing an O H O ring closure bond, and being sufficiently stable for parenteral administration and imaging by scintillation scanning, any alkylene substituents present being of the kind useful for adapting radionuclide ligands for body imaging applications. Preferred complexes are believed to have the formula where each R¹, R⁴, and R⁵ is hydrogen or C1 to C12, and each of R² and R³ is hydrogen, hydroxyl, C1 to C12 alkoxyl, C1 to C22 hydrocarbon which may be alkyl, alkenyl, alkaryl, aralkyl or aryl, or tertiary amine with 1 to 20 carbon atoms, or R² and R³ form, together with the carbon atom to which they are attached, a cycloaliphatic group which may be amine substituted. One compound of the above formula specifically mentioned in European Patent Specification 123504 is compound 2 below The present invention relates to a complex, and the associated ligand, falling within the scope of the invention of the aforesaid European patent specification but not specifically described therein, which complex shows interesting properties particularly as regards brain retention. The complex is a lipophilic macrocyclic complex, useful as a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical, of Technetium 99m with a propylene amine oxime ligand having the formula 1 The compound of formula 1 has two asymmetric carbon atoms and thus exists in the form of three stereoisomers. Another important aspect of this invention results from the unexpected discovery that there are significant differences between the All the stereoisomers are capable of forming complexes with radioactive and non radioactive isotopes of metals other than technetium, for example, palladium and platinum, which complexes may have useful properties for therapy and diagnosis. The following diagram shows how compound 1 exists in the form of an optically inactive meso diastereoisomer and of optically active d and l enantiomers. The isomerism arises because the 3 and 9 carbon atoms are asymmetric. The meso diastereoisomer has distinctly different properties from the dl diastereoisomer a racemic mixture of the d and l enantiomers . For example, they have different melting points, and their retention times on HPLC systems can also differ. The Tc 99m complexes from the two diastereoisomers have markedly different It has further been determined that the d and l enantiomers of compound 1 have properties physical and biological which differ from each other, and from a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers, and from the meso diastereoisomer. The different Similarly, there is a surprising difference in brain uptake of the d and l enantiomers of compound 1 a factor of 1.6 has been found in studies with rats. Each of the three stereoisomers so far mentioned can itself exist in three different isomeric forms by virtue of the restricted rotation about their C N bonds of the two oxime groups. The isomers may have different physical properties m.p., b.p. and can be separated by chromatographic techniques TLC and HPLC . Their interconversion is generally facile and is catalysed by mineral or Lewis acids, bases or metal ions. Compound 1 has two oxime groups so 3 isomers are possible Note that EZ is identical to ZE. The same considerations apply to both d and l isomers, i.e. each has three EE, ZZ and EZ oxime isomers. The thermodynamically preferred isomer is expected to be EE since that has the maximum separation of the bulkier groups. HPLC analysis of compound 1 Example 3 displays two major peaks, identified as the EE oxime isomers of the meso and d,l diastereoisomers, plus four minor peaks, provisionally assigned as the EZ and ZZ oxime isomers of each diastereoisomer. It is probable that the EE, EZ and ZZ isomers may form Tc 99m complexes having different biodistribution properties. The propylene amine oxime ligands i.e. compounds 1 and 2 may be prepared by standard chemical routes, as generally described in the aforesaid European Patent Specification 123504. A preferred preparative route is described below in Example 1. The compounds are generally obtained in the form of a mixture of all three isomers. The meso isomer can be separated from the dl mixture by standard techniques such as repeated fractional crystallisation from a solvent in which their solubilities are different we have used acetonitrile and ethyl acetate with success. The analytical or preparative separation of the isomers can also be effected by HPLC. The d and l enantiomers can be separated by standard techniques involving the use of optical isomers of an organic acid such as tartaric acid. Separation techniques are detailed in Examples 3 to 8 below. The complexation reaction between the propylene amine oxime ligand and pertechnetate TcO₄ from generator eluate may be carried out in aqueous or aqueous organic solution under reducing conditions. Stannous salts are convenient reducing agents, but other reducing agents are well known for this type of reaction and can be used. Since the complex of this invention contains Tc 99m bound rather strongly, it can alternatively be prepared by a process of ligand exchange. The preparation of Tc 99m complexes by reducing pertechnetate in the presence of a complexing ligand is well known the conditions for such general reactions are also well known and can be used in the particular instance of this invention. The Tc 99m complex of compound 1 is presently believed to have the structure 3 The Tc 99m complex of compound 1 an unseparated dl meso mixture displays Its advantages over the Tc 99m complex of compound 2 are The complex of compound 1 dl isomer is surprisingly superior to the complex of the meso isomer, so far as brain retention and brain imaging are concerned. By contrast, the complexes of compound 2 dl isomer and compound 2 meso isomer do not show any marked difference in brain uptake see Example 12 below . The complexes of compound 1 both the unseparated dl meso mixture and the dl isomer also show other interesting and unexpected properties The following Examples illustrate the invention. 2, 3 Butanedione monoxime 11.66g, 115.4mmol was dissolved in benzene 50cm³ containing acetic acid 75µl , and the solution was brought to reflux in an apparatus fitted with a Dean Stark trap and in a nitrogen atmosphere. To this was added a solution of 2,2 dimethyl 1,3 propanediamine 5.00g, 5.88cm³, 49mmol in benzene 100cm³ over a period of 5 hours. The resulting yellow brown solution was refluxed for a further 16 hours under nitrogen, then allowed to cool to room temperature. The resulting solid was filtered off under suction and washed with a little cold 40 The diimine 75g, 287mmol was slurried in 95 aqueous ethanol 690cm³ at 0 Methyl nitrite was bubbled, at a rate sufficient to maintain vigorous reflux, into a well stirred mixture of 2 pentanone 102g ether 400cm³ and concentrated hydrochloric acid 15cm³ . The methyl nitrite gas was generated by the dropwise addition of a mixture of concentrated sulphuric acid 100cm³ and water 95cm³ onto a stirred slurry of sodium nitrite 112g , methanol 66g and water 75cm³ . After the addition was complete the mixture was neutralised with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate 32g in 300cm³ . The ether layer was separated and the aqueous layer extracted with more ether. The combined organic layers were dried and concentrated The following were prepared in a similar manner yield and melting point given The following diimine was prepared in a similar manner to Example 1 yield and melting point given The following ligand was prepared in a similar manner to Example 1 yield, melting point and NMR data given The analytical separation of the meso and d,l diastereoisomers was accomplished by normal phase HPLC using a 250x4.6mm stainless steel column packed with 5 µm silica gel microspheres connected to a commercial dual pump chromatographic system. Detection was via a variable UV detector set at 210nm, and output from the detector was directed to a chart recorder and microcomputer programmed for peak integration. The solvent system used throughout consisted of a mixture of 85 methanol and 15 0.4M aqueous ammonia v v . In order to exclude the possibility of column degradation using this solvent system, a precolumn packed with silica gel 15 µm 25 µm particles was placed in the solvent line before the sample injector. The flow rate used throughout was 1ml min ¹. Samples consisting of a mixture of diastereoisomers of Compound 1 were dissolved in methanol at a concentration of 10mg ml ¹, and 10 µl aliquots were analysed. Baseline resolution was obtained with no evidence of tailing, and retention times of 8.90 min and 9.87 min were recorded for the meso E,E and d,l E,E isomers respectively. A sample of crude product, obtained direct from the aqueous work up 38g, ratio 60 40, meso dl was recrystallised four times successively from hot acetonitrile giving pure meso isomer as fine white needles 10.5g , m.p. 149.5 150 A sample of crude product 9.8g, ratio 50 50 was doubly recrystallised from hot acetonitrile giving dl enriched material 4.6g, ratio 47 53 meso dl . The filtrate from the second crystallisation was set aside at room temperature. A small crop of crystals 220 mg, ratio 20 80, meso dl was removed and then the filtrate concentrated Crystals suitable for X ray crystallography were obtained by crystallisation of the separated diastereoisomers from methanol. Details of the structure determination are given below. The determinations demonstrate that the diastereoisomer with an HPLC retention time of 8.90 minutes Example 3A is the meso diastereoisomer, while the diastereoisomer with a retention time of 9.87 minutes is the dl diastereoisomer. In both cases, the configuration of the oxime functionalities is EE. ¹H NMR spectra were run in d₆ DMSO at 500MHz using a Bruker AM 500 FT NMR spectrometer. The following assignments were made. For the carbon atom numbering, see the diagram above entitled Diastereoisomers of Compound 1 In the d,l diastereoisomer, the methyl groups attached to C₆ are in equivalent environments, and so should give a single signal. This has been assigned to the singlet at 0.7835 ppm. In the meso diastereoisomer, the methyl groups attached to C₆ are in different environments, and so two singlets should be seen. These have been assigned to the singlets at 0.7748 and 0.7779 ppm. ¹³C NMR spectra were run in d₆ DMSO or d₄ MeOH using a Bruker AM 250 FT NMR spectrometer or a Jeol FX 200 FT NMR spectrometer. The following assignments were made The assigments were supported by off resonance and selective proton decoupling experiments. As with the proton spectrum, the signals for the gem dimethyl groups at C₆ are distinct for the two isomers. The clearest distinction between the isomers can be seen in the signals for the carbons C₅ and C₇, the signal for the d,l diastereoisomer being seen approximately 0.55ppm downfield of the corresponding signal for the meso diastereoisomer. The relative integrations for these signals corresponded closely to the values obtained for the isomer ratios by HPLC for a wide variety of samples. The diastereoisomer of Compound 1 was treated with an equivalent of L tartaric acid in hot ethanolic solution. The solution was allowed to cool, and the white solid was filtered off and recrystallised three times to give a tartrate salt of one enantiomer α The filtrate from the above preparation was concentrated, and the salt was decomposed to give Compound 1 of unknown enantiomer proportions by dissolving in water, basifying to pH9, and filtering off the white solid. This was recrystallised from ethyl acetate to give white crystals. This sample was treated with an equivalent of D tartaric acid in hot ethanolic solution, and the resulting white solid was recrystallised three times to give the tartrate of the other enantiomer, α The samples of the tartrate salts thus obtained were converted into the free bases by the method given above to give samples of d and l Compound 1. The tartrate salt gave l Compound 1, α The meso and d,l forms of Compound 2 were separated by HPLC using a modification of the HPLC conditions employed in Example 3. The only differences were that the solvent composition was 98 MeOH and 2 0.4 M aqueous ammonia, instead of 85 and 15 respectively, and that the flow rate was 2ml min ¹ with a preparative column. Under these conditions the faster running isomer had a retention time of approximately 24 minutes, and that of the slower running isomer was approximately 26 minutes. The isomers were separated by preparative HPLC, giving samples of approximately 90 purity as estimated by HPLC. From the ¹H NMR spectra the diastereoisomer eluted first was designated meso , and the fraction is the d,l form. Due to rapid equilibration effects, the E,Z oxime isomer of Compound 1 had proved impossible to characterize as an isolated component. However, the labelling of the E,Z oxime isomer was studied, by isolation of the HPLC peak corresponding to the E,Z oxime isomer with immediate labelling of the resulting solution. Experiments using the E,E isomer showed that labelling under these conditions proceeded smoothly. Using the E,Z isomer it was not possible to obtain consistent results, due in part to irreproducibility of the HPLC method and in part to the equilibration process however, a number of complexes were obtained, including a lipophilic species usually 20 , and probably derived from the E,E isomer from re equilibration of the E,Z isomer and several more hydrophilic species. A sterile freeze dried formulation of 1.0mg of the compound 1 a dl meso mixture and 15 mg of stannous tartrate in a sealed 10 ml glass vial containing a nitrogen atmosphere, was reconstituted with 3 8 ml of eluate of Tc 99m pertechnetate, obtained from a Mo 99 Tc 99m generator system. Analysis of the resultant mixture indicated that reduction of pertechnetate to a lower oxidation form of technetium , and complexation of the reduced technetium by the ligand is complete after standing at ambient temperatures for 1 minute. The Tc 99m complex of Compound 2 and individual isomers and enantiomers thereof was formed similarly. An alternative and currently preferred formulation consists of 0.5mg of compound 1 dl isomer , 4.5mg of sodium chloride, and 7.6mg of stannous chloride dihydrate. Glass fibre strips impregnated with silica gel form the stationary phase of a fast and accurate analytical system. Two strips, each measuring 20 cm x 2 cm were used in each analysis. Approximately five microlitres of the solution containing the complex was applied 1 cm from the base of each strip, and one strip developed with saline, the other with methylethyl ketone MEK . Determination of the distribution of radioactivity along each strip was conducted by means of a 100 channel analysis system interfaced to a Nova computer, programmed for peak integration. The Table below indicates the RF values of the major components of the Tc 99m solutions. The observed radiochemical purity of the Tc 99m complexes was generally greater than 80 . Radiochemical purity determinations by thin layer chromatography were carried out at several time points following formation of the technetium complexes of compounds 1 and 2 a dl meso mixture in each case to determine the stability of the complexes. Typical results are shown in the table below. The 0.1 ml of the Tc 99m complex solution was administered by intravenous injection lateral tail vein to each of five or six rats 140 220g . The injected dose was equivalent to approximately lmCi of Tc 99m. Three rats were sacrificed at 2 minutes post injection, and 3 at 1 hour or 2 at 2 hours post injection. At dissection, the organs and blood samples shown in the following table were taken, and assayed for radioactivity. The uptake in each organ or tissue was calculated as a percentage of the total activity recovered. The ratio of diastereoisomers in the Tc 99m complexes used in this experiment is not known. The results at 2 minutes and 1 hour p.i. are the mean of 3 animals. The results at 2 hours p.i. are the mean of 2 animals. The experiment of Example 10 was repeated using the separated diastereoisomers of compound 1. The results are given in the Table below and should be compared to those for compound 1 the mixture in the Table in Example 10. The reasons for the differences in brain uptake and retention are not understood, but do not appear to result from any difference in lipophilicity between the Tc 99m complexes of the two isomers. We have compared the lipophilicities of the two complexes, by a special HPLC method developed by ourselves for this purpose, and have concluded that they are indistinguishable. Data in Tables a and b are the mean from 3 animals at each time point. They were obtained at a different time and using different formulations, from the data in Example 11. All clinical studies, involving comparisons between the Tc 99m complexes of dl and meso, and d,l and dl stereoisomers of Compound 1 were conducted in normal volunteer subjects at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. This study was published The following table demonstrates the mean percentage of total activity injected per organ at 20 minutes p.i. Data is then taken from area of interest studies employing a whole body scanning device. The following table gives the mean of three studies for each stereoisomer, of percentage of injected dose in normal volunteers at 30 minutes p.i. The following data allows comparison of the relative performance of the complexes of compounds 1 and 2 an unseparated dl meso mixture in each case in human volunteer subjects. Tomographic images of the brain were determined using the same complexes in normal volunteers. The device used was a single head rotating gamma camera and minicomputer system. 64 25 second images were accumulated by the gamma camera during 360 Good quality tomographic images of the brain were obtained by the reconstruction of the images obtained using the complex of Compound 1 by the minicomputer. The images obtained using the complex of Compound 2 were less good, due to a higher level of background radiation, resulting from a higher uptake in soft tissue regions. A solution of the technetium 99m complex of compound 1 was made as follows. A vial contained 0.5mg compound 1 7.5mg stannous chloride dihydrate and 4.5mg sodium chloride freeze dried and sealed under nitrogen. To this was added 5.0ml of sodium pertechnetate eluate from a 135mCi technetium generator. Mixed leucocytes were obtained from 34ml of acid citrate anticoagulated blood by dextran sedimentation. These were washed twice and resuspended in 2.0ml phosphate buffered saline containing approximately 0.25mg ml prostaglandin El. The suspension was incubated with 0.2ml of the solution of the technetium 99m complex of compound 1. Incubation was at ambient temperature, and samples were removed at intervals for analysis. After two minutes, 60 of the radioactivity was associated with blood cells after 5 minutes, 83 and after 10 minutes, 89 . Tc 99m labelled leucocytes prepared by this method were injected into rats bearing abscesses produced by implantation of sponge impregnated with faecal extract. Abscess uptake was identical to that for In lll labelled leucocytes.
