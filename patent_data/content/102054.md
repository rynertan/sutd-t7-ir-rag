# Method for growing GaAs single crystal by using floating zone.

## Abstract
An apparatus for growing a GaAs single crystal by relying on the floating zone technique in a cylinder 1 charged with a GaAs polycrystal 6 and a GaAs single seed crystal 3 , comprising an As container 11 communicating with the interior of a cylinder 1 to supply an optimum vapor pressure of As into the cylinder 1 under the condition that a continuous temperature variation is established between this As container 11 and the GaAs crystals 3,6 charged in the cylinder 1 , whereby a GaAs single crystal 4 having little deviation from stoichiometry and having a good crystal perfection is obtained.
