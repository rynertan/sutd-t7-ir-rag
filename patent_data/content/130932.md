# Thermal cracking process for selectively producing petrochemical products from hydrocarbons.

## Abstract
A thermal cracking process for selectively producing petrochemical products from hydrocarbons which compri ses the steps of burning hydrocarbons with oxygen in the presence of steam to produce a hot gas of from 1300 to 3000 C comprising steam feeding hydrogen to the hot gas further feeding starting hydrocarbons to the hot gas compri sing the steam and hydrogen so that the starting hydrocar bons containing hydrocarbon components of higher boiling points are, respectively, fed to higher temperature zones so as to thermally crack the respective hydrocarbons under dif ferent conditions while keeping cracking temperature at 650 to 1500 C, the total residence time at 5 to 1000 milliseconds, the pressure at 2 to 100 bars, and the partial pressure of hydrogen, after thermal cracking of a hydrocarbon compris ing hydrocarbon components whose boiling point exceeds 200 C, at least 0.1 bar and quenching the resulting reaction product.
