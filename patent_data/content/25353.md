## Description
Background of the Invention The present invention relates to resinous starblock copolymers having improved impact properties and good clarity. Highly branched block copolymers, sometimes called star block copolymers, are old in the art of anionic polymerization. These star block copolymers are prepared by first forming linear block polymers having active lithium atorn on one end of the polymer chain. These active, linear polymer chains are then coupled by the addition of a polyfunctional compound having at least three reactive sites capable of reacting with the carbon to lithium bond on the polymer chains to add the polymer chain onto the functional groups of the compound. Zelinski, U.S. 3,280,084, polymerized butadiene with butyllithium initiator to foam B Li blocks where B is polybutadiene which when coupled with 0.02 to 1 part by weight per 100 parts of monomers of divinylbenzene gave star block copolymers having polydivinylbenzene nuclei and several identical anns of polybutadiene branching therefrom.The arms can also be either random or block copolymers of styrene and butadiene from A B Li blocks, where A is polvstyrene segment where the diene is the major component. Zelinski, U.S. 3,281,383, teaches similar starblock copolymers to those in U.S. 3,280,084, except that coupling agents such as polyepoxy compounds, polyacids, polyaldehydes, etc., are used. Haefele et al, U.S. 3,485,787, produces elastomeric compositions by blending mineral oils with thermoplastic linear triblock copolymers. Childers, U.S. 3,637,554, prepares rubbery starblock copolymers having nuclei formed from polyepoxides, polyisocyanates, polyimines, etc., and identical arms from B Li and A B Li. Fetters et al, U.S. 3,985,830, discloses a product having a nucleus of more than one molecule of m divinylbenzene and at least thee polymeric arms, each being a block copolymer of conjugated diene and monovinyl aromatic monomers wherein said conjugated diene block is linked to said nucleus. Himes, U.S, 4,107,124, teaches compositions cornprising star block copolymers, polystyrenes, mineral oil, and a finely divided filler for use in shoe sole compositions. Ilansen, U.S. 4,141,876, produces adhesive compositions by blending a hydrogenated star block copolymer with mineral oil, a polyphenylene ether resin, and a tackifying resin.Summary of the Invention We have now found that elastomeric star block copolymers can be made which have greater oil extendability and whose extended formulations have greater hardness of compound and more resistance to motor oils than formulations made with other copolymers. The copolymers contain 25 to 55 percent by weight, preferably 30 to 50 percent by weight, of a monovinyl aromatic compound and 45 to 75 percent by weight, preferably 50 to 70 percent by weight, of a conjugated diene having 4 to 8 carbon atoms The copolymers have the general formula A B X where A is a non elastomeric polymer segnent based on the total monovinyl aromatic compound, B is an elastomeric segment based on the conjugated diene, m is an integer between 3 and 20, and X is the radical of a polyfunctional coupling agent forming the nucleus of the star block copolymer.Detailed Description of the Invention The elastomeric star block copolymers of this invention are prepared by a three stage process of anionic polymerization. In the first stage, the total amount of monovinyl aromatic compound is polymerized in an inert solvent using a hydrocarbyllithium initiator to form linear segments A Li , of the monovinyl aromatic compound having lithium ions at the ends. The polymerization is allowed to proceed to essential completion. In the second stage, the conjugated diene is added and allowed to proceed to essentially complete conversion to form A B Li linear blocks. In the third stage, a polyfunctional coupling agent is added to the solution of A B Li segments and allowed to couple the segments into the radial block copolymer of general formula A BTi X, where m is an integer between 3 and 20, A is the nonelastomeric polymer segment based on the total monovinyl aromatic compound,B is an elastomeric polymer segment based on the conjugated diene and X is the radical of the polyfunctional coupling agent. The monovinyl aromatic compound useful in the invention is preferably styrene, but may be alkyl substituted styrenes which have similar copolymerization characteristics, such as, alphamethylstyrene and the ring substituted methylstyrenes, ethylstyrenes and t butylstyrene. The amount of monovinyl aromatic compound useful in the invention is between 25 and 55 percent by weight, and preferably 30 to 50 percent by weight, based on the total weight of monomers utilized. The hydrocarbyllithium initiators useful in the invention are the known alkyllithium compounds, such as methyllithium, n butyllithium, sec butyllithium the cycloalkyllithium compounds, such as cyclo hexyllithium and the aryllithium compounds1 such as phenyllithium, p tolyllithium and naphthyllithium. The amounts of hydrocarbyllithium added should be between 0.2 and 10.0millimoles per mole of monomer. The total amount of initiator used depends on the molecular weight and number of polymer chains desired. The conjugated dienes useful in the invention are those having from 4 to 8 carbon atoms in the molecule, such as 1,3 butadiene, isoprene, 2,3 dimetbyl l,3 butadiene, piperylene and mixtures thereof. The polymerization is conducted in an inert hydrocarbon solvent such as isobutane, pentane, cyclohexane, benzene, toluene, xylene and the like. The polymerization is carried out in the absence of air, moisture, or any other impurity which is known to be detrimental to anionic catalyst systems. The temperature of polymerization may be conventionally from 0 to 1200C, and preferably between 400 and 800C. The polyfunctional coupling agents suitable for the invention may be the polyvinyl aromatic compounds such as divinylbenzene, which althouyh only difutlctional as monomers, can polymerize to form polyfunctional agents in situ and serve as coupling agents. Suitable are the ortho , mta , or para divinylbenzenes, or mixtures therof. In the case of difunctional agents which polymerize during the coupling reaction, such as divinylbenzene, the amounts of agent to be used must be determined for the conditions of reaction, since the number of equivalent functional sites is variable. However, the amounts will vary only from 1.2 to 3.5 parts by weight, and preferably 1.3 to 3.0 parts by weight, of divinylbenzene per 100 parts by weight of total monomers. The following examples are given to illustrate the invention, but not to limit the claims. All parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified. Example I A one gallon stirred reactor was charged with 2,000 g. of purified cyclohexane and heated to 600C. A trace of diphenylethylene 0.2 g. was added to the cyclohexane by means of a hypodermic needle. A solution of sec butyl lithium in cyclohexane was added to the reactor portionwise until a permanent orange yellow color was obtained. The solution was then backtitrated with cyclo hexane until the color just disappeared. The solvent and reactor were now ready for the polymerization of monomer.Into the closed reactor was charged 13.7 m. moles of sec butyllithium and 307 g. of styrene and the reactor held at 600C for 20 minutes. Analysis of the solution byU.V. analysis showed that less than 0.01 by weight of the styrene monomer remained. Number average molecular weights in of the polystyrene blocks were determined by Gel Permeation Chromatography to be 28,000. At this point, 361 y. of butadiene was added to the reactor and the whole mixture held for 60 minutes to complete the polymerization of the butadiene. The diblock anns thus formed were analyzed by refractive index and found to be 46t by weight styrene and 54t butadiene.There was then added 14.7 g. of divinylbenzene of 53t purity and the whole was held for 1 2 hours at 700C to complete the linking reaction. The system was terminated by the addition of 1 g. of methanol. The polymer solution was transferred to a 5 gallon polyethylene liner, diluted further with acetone and the polymer was precipitated by adding isopropanol under high speed stirring. The polymer was then treated with 0.5 part Polygard IIR, a commercial antioxidant, and 0.5 part 2,6 ditert butyl 4 methylphenol per 100 parts by weight of polymer. The wet polymer was dried at 500C in an oven under vacuum at less than 100 microns of mercury. The resulting star block polymer was found to have about 8 linear arms. Each arm has Mn of about 60,900, made up of a polystyrene block of Mn 28,000 and a polybutadiene block of Mn 32,900. The divinylbenzene was present in an amount of 1.2 parts per hundred of monomer phm . Oil extended star block copolymer was prepared by placing the neat elastomer in a 1 gallon screw cap jar and redissolving in sufficient cyclohexane to produce a 15 by weight solids solution. Enough oil to give a mixture of 50 parts of oil per hundred parts of elastomer phr was then added and the jar was rolled until the oil and elastomer was completely mixed. The mineral oil added was flUfflO G05d, a naphthenic mineral oil sold by ARCO Petroleum ProductsCompany. The oil elastomer cyclohexane solution was dried in a vacuum oven following the same procedure used for drying neat polymer, above. The oil extended product was labeledIA for future reference. A second star block elastomer was prepared by the above method which had about 7.5 linear arms, each having Mn of about 67,400, made up of 46g by weight of a polystyrene block of Mn 31,000 and 54 by weight of a polybutadiene block of Mn 36,400 The divinylbenzene was present in an amount of 1.33 phm. After extension with 50 phr of Tufflo 6054, the oil extended elastomer was labeled IB for future reference. The oil extended elastomers IA and IB were evaluated in a medium hardness unit shoe sole formulation and compared with several commercial oil extended elastomers.The formulation was as follows Ingredient Parts By weight Oil Extended Elastomer 100.0 Tufflo 6054 Oil 50.5 Crystal Polystyrene 35.0 Hi Sil 233 20.0 Zn Stearate 1.1 Irganox 1010 1.1 DLTDP 0.6The crystal polystyrene used was Dylene 3D, a crystal polystyrene containing 3 oil sold by ARCO Polymers, Inc. Hi Sil 233 is an amorphous silica sold by PPG Industries. Irganox 1010 is a hindered phenol antioxidant sold by Ciba Geigry Corp.DLTDP is the stabilizer, dilaurylthiodiproprionate, sold by Cincinnati Milacron. Commercial oil extended elastomers used for comparison were the following Kraton 4122, a linear triblock copolymer of 48 52 styrene butadiene composition Kraton 4141, a linear triblock copolymer of 30 70 styrene butadiene composition and Kraton 4140, a star block copolymer of 44 56 styrene butadiene composition, all sold by Shell Chemical Co. Solprene 475, a star block copolymer of 40 60 styrene butadiene composition and Solprene 481, a star block copolymer of 48 52 styrene butadiene composition, both sold by Phillips Petroleum Co. The formulations containing the various elastomers were compression molded at 1400C into 4 x 4 x 100 mil plaques and 2 x 2 x 1 4 plaques. The Shore A hardness values were determined on an A 2 Durometer 10 seconds after initial contact with the plaque. The tensile strength at break was determined by ASTM D412 at a test rate of 20 in. min. The melt index was determined by ASTM D1238 65T at 1900C under a load of 2.16 Kg. The results are shown inTable I.

Example II The oil extended star block copolymer elastomers,IA and IB, prepared in Example I, were blended into a hard unit sole formulation and injection molded in a shoe sole mold. The soles were tested for hardness, melt index, and in two different flex tests. In the Ross Flexural Test, a small cut was placed in the sole, and the sole was then flexed 500,000 flexes. If no cut growth occurred, the soles and the base oil extended elastomer passed the test.In the oil resistance test, the surface of the molded sole was coated with motor oil Gulfpride G and then flexed in the Ross Flexometer until the sole cracked failure . The results are shown in Table II, along with a comparison with the commercial oil extended elastomer, Kraton 4122, which is a linear triblock of styrene butadiene content of 48 52 weight percent ratio.

The results point out the usefulness of the star block elastomers of this invention in hard unit sole formulations. Thus, the formulated compound has greater hardness than those made with presently available commercial copolymers the oil resistance of the formulated compound is greater and since the equivalent amount of oil in the formulated compounds gives harder shoe soles, the compounds of this invention can be further extended with oil to give a compound having equivalent hardness to those made with the commercially available oil extended rubbers. This greater oil extendability is a desirable property. Example III A 30 70 weight ratio styrene butadiene block copolymer is prepared as follows Into a one gallon reactor is charged 2,000 g. of purified cyclohexane. The solvent is heated to 600C and dried by titration as in Example I. There is then added 20.0 in. moles of sec butyllithium initiator and 200 g. of styrene and the reactor held at 60 C for 20 minutes. Number average molecular weight of the polystyrene blocks thus formed are 10,000. At this point, 468 g. of butadiene is added and allowed to polymerize for I hour to complete the polymerization of the diene. The diblock arms will be found to have 302 by weight styrene and 702 by weight butadiene. There is then added 26.8 g. of 53 divinylbenzene 2.12 phm and the mixture is helt at 700C for 1 2 hours to complete the coupling reaction. The system is terminated, the polymer stabilized, and the polymer recovered as in Example I.The polymer will have about 10 arms having Mn of about 33,400 made up of poly styrene blocks of Mn 10,000 and polybutadiene blocks of Mn 23, 400. Similarly if one prepares a polymer from 20.0 m. moles of initiator, 267 g. of styrene, 401 g. butadiene and 2.75 phm of divinylbenzene, one obtains a polymer having 40E by weight styrene, 60 by weight butadiene with about 12 arms per star block polymer. Each arm will have Mn of 33,400 made up of polystyrene blocks of Mn 13,350 and polybutadiene blocks of Mn 20,050. Both star block copolymers prepared in this Example III can be oil extended and compounded into medium hardness unit shoe sole formulations, such as the one in Example I. The sole formulations would both have tensile strengths at break of greater than 900 psi and compression moled Shore A hardness of greater than 50.In either case, the formulations would have greaterShore A hardness than commercial oil eextended elastomers having comparable stryene butadiene ratios.
