# Apparatus for tracking an information track on a recording medium.

## Abstract
A servo control apparatus for maintaining a scanning device, such as a beam 15 of radiation, aligned with an information recording track on a moving recording medium, such as a record disc 11 . The apparatus is especially adapted for use in correcting for tracking deviations brought about by temperature induced expansion and contraction of the disc, which causes the recording track being scanned to move radially outwardly or inwardly relative to the beam of radiation. In the preferred embodiment, the apparatus includes a movable mirror 39 for oscillating the beam in a radial direction. In accordance with a periodic dither signal. This causes a corresponding variation in the intensity of the beam 41 reflected by the disc, with the amplitude and phase angle of this intensity variation relative to that of the dither signal, indicating the direction and magnitude of the deviation of the beam from the track centerline. Whenever the magnitude exceeds a prescribed level, a step forward or step reverse pulse signal is coupled to a stepper motor 45 to increment the beam in the appropriate radial direction, whereby the beam is main tained substantially aligned with the centerline of the recording track.
