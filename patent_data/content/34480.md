# ALKYLATION OF AMINES

## Abstract
A process for preparing a N alkylamine or N, N dialkylamine, which comprises reacting a primary or sec ondary amine with a primary or secondary alcohol in the presence of a catalyst selected from iridium, rhodium, ruthenium, osmium, platinum, palladium and rhenium, pres ent either as the metal or a salt or complex thereof. The catalyst is preferably a complex such as RhH PPh₃ ₄. The pro cess can be used to cause cyclisation, including internal cycli sation so that, by way of example, N methyl pyrrolidine may be prepared from 1 pyrrolidine and methanol 2 1,4 butanediol and methylamine and 3 4 methylamino 1 butanol.
