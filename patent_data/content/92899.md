# METHOD OF AND APPARATUS FOR PIPE LENGTH MEASUREMENT

## Abstract
To measure the length L a sound transducer 12 is placed in open air communication with the pipe 80 at a spacing P determined by a stand off device 28. P decreases as the pipe diameter increases but there is a compensating increase in the distance a from the other end of the pipe to the effective reflecting surface for acoustic pulses transmitted down the pipe. The time of travel of a pulse from the transducer and back is measured by the count of an oscillator whose frequency is ambient temperature controlled and the count is modified by a constant C corresponding to the sum of a and P. In an alternative embodiment the end correction is introduced by measuring the amplitude of the greatest reflected peak of a first pulse and then setting the gain at a higher level so that a second pulse stops the timer when it reaches 40 of the peak amplitude.
