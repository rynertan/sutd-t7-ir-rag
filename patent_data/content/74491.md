# Heated junction thermocouple level measurement apparatus.

## Abstract
A liquid level sensing apparatus 32 comprises a plurality of axially spaced sensors 36 enclosed in a tube 86 for separating liquid and gaseous phase. The separator tube 86 contains inlet outlet ports 90, 92 near the top and bottom thereof to equalize the liquid level inside and outsde the separator tube 86 . Each sensor 36 is comprised of a heater 64 , a heated thermocouple junction 68 and an unheated thermocouple junction 66 within an elongated heat conductive housing 62 . The heated portion of housing 62 is enclosed in splash guard 72 with inlet outlet ports 78, 82 near the top and bottom. The separator tube 86 is enclosed in support tube 100 which may be enclosed in a shroud 110 . The lateral inlet outlet ports 90, 92 of separator tube 86 are axially offset from lateral inlet outlet ports 102 of support tube 100 at least where support tube 100 is subjected to cross flow. The shroud 110 is open on the bottom and has lateral inlet outlet ports 112 to equalize liquid level fluctuations inside and outside shroud 110 .
