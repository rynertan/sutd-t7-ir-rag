# A pneumatic gun for forcibly inserting fixing elements, such as nails, metal staples and similar.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an improved gun for forcibly inserting fixing elements, such as nails, comprising an operat ing piston 25 carrying an arm 33 destined to fire the fixing elements, which slides in a cylinder 18 open at one extremity 18a towards the compressed air tank 7 provided in the stock 1 of the gun. The displacements of the operating piston 25 are imposed by a control piston 57 situated above the said open extremity 18a , while the said operating piston 25 takes its movement from a valve 68 , operated by the trigger 72 of the gun, movable between two extreme configurations. With the gun, the following is involved limited travel of the valve 68 between its extreme configurations a control piston 57 conformation such as to limit its inertia and pres sure losses between the cylinder 18 and the tank 7 an operating piston 25 conformation such as to render it impact resistant and anchored firmly to the corresponding ejector arm 33 .
