# Electrophoretic apparatus.

## Abstract
An isotachophoretic apparatus which is equipped with means for discriminating whether each of the zones of a sample having been separated by electrophoresis is a completely separate one having already been separated into a single component or an incompletely separate one. The discriminating means is constructed of means for detecting zones at different instants, e.g., two usual detectors, means for detecting the length of the zones, e.g., a time counter and means for comparing the lengths of the two corresponding zones and judging the completion of separation, e.g., a microcomputer.
