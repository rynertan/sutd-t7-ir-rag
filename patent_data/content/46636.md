# Ultrasonic bond energy monitor.

## Abstract
A monitor for optimizing the ultrasonic bonding of materials by analyzing the impedance of an ultrasonic transducer in a generator 26 used to effect the bond. The electrical impedance of the transducer, which is proportional to its mechanical impedance, is determined by applying an ultrasonic voltage thereto and monitoring the resultant change in current amplitude. A divider circuit 30 provides an impedance signal which is coupled to a pair of differen tiators 34,36 to produce a second derivative signal of the impedance with respect to time. A zero crossing detector 38 determines a negative going zero crossing of this signal which corresponds to completion of the bond. The monitor includes a logic circuit 40 to detect loss of wire, mechanical malfunctions and improper bonds, thereby forming a real time quality control system.
