# Permanent magnet alloy.

## Abstract
A permanent magnet alloy that when used in the production of a permanent magnet results in a magnet that is highly resistant to distintegration when exposed to a com bination of humidity and heat. Consequently, the alloy consists essentially of, in weight percent, 30 to 36 of at least one rare earth element, 60 to 66 iron, 6,000 to 35,000 ppm oxygen and balance boron.
