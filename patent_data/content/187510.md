## Description
This invention relates to apparatus for processing a plurality of component video signals which are time compressed. More particularly, but not exclusively, the invention relates to a write clock pulse generator used for a time base corrector, for example a write clock pulse generator used for an apparatus for recording and or reproducing a video signal which is time compressed and multiplexed. In a previously proposed video tape recorder VTR , in a recording mode, component signals such as a luminance signal, colour difference signals and so on forming a video signal are time compressed, time multiplexed as shown in Figure 1A of the accompanying drawings and then recorded. In a reproduction mode, the time compressed and time multiplexed signals are divided, time expanded and then employed to generate a reproduced video signal. In the above mentioned VTR, the frequency of a write clock pulse signal used for carrying out the time compressing and multiplexing in the recording mode and the frequency of a write clock pulse signal used for carrying out the time dividing and expanding in the reproduction mode are made to be the same as each other, whereby the respective reproduced component signals are synchronised with one another. However, the fact that the frequency of the clock signal used during recording and the frequency of the clock signal used during reproduction are made to be the same as each other means that the frequency of the clock signal used during reproduction is restricted by the frequency of the clock signal used during recording. In practice, if respective circuits formed as integrated circuits ICs and the like and having the same design concept can be applied to VTRs of different specifications, the system can be made common to the VTRs so that the VTRs can be produced with ease and at low manufacturing cost. Accordingly, there is a case for using existing circuits even if this leads to the result that the frequency of the clock signal used during recording and the frequency of the clock signal used during reproduction become different. When a digital signal is processed by a circuit on the reproducing side the digital signal being, for example, balance modulated , in most of the circuits a clock signal having a frequency which is multiple of a colour subcarrier frequency for example, 4 times is employed. If the frequency of the clock signal used for the time division and expansion upon reproduction or playback is selected to be the same as the frequency of the clock signal for the digital processing, many advantages in circuit arrangement and signal processing can be brought about. Accordingly, it may be considered that even if the frequency of the clock signal used in the time division and expansion upon reproduction becomes different from the frequency of the clock signal used in time compressing and multiplexing upon recording, the frequency of the clock signal used for time division and expansion upon reproduction coincides with a multiple of the colour subcarrier frequency. However, if a frequency N₁f European Patent Application Publication No EP A 0 149 244, which was published on 24 July 1985 and forms part of the state of the art as regards the present application only by virtue of EPC Article 54 3 , discloses apparatus for processing a plurality of component video signals which are time compressed into one horizontal scanning period, the apparatus comprising According to the present invention there is provided apparatus for processing and time correcting a plurality of component video signals reproduced from a video tape recorder, which signals were recorded sequentially in a time compressed manner in one horizontal scanning period, the apparatus comprising Preferred embodiments of this invention described hereinbelow provide a write clock pulse generator used for a time base corrector in which, even when a frequency of a time compressing and multiplexing sampling clock pulse at a recording side and a frequency of a write clock pulse used in time dividing and expanding are different from each other, the phases of component signals can be made coincident with each other upon time expansion. In the preferred embodiments, the sampling clock frequency at a reproducing side is not restricted by a sampling clock frequency at a recording side so that the same circuit arrangement can be applied to various kinds of reproducing apparatus. The preferred embodiments provide a write clock pulse generator for a time base corrector which is suitable to be applied to a video tape recorder or other video recording and or reproducing apparatus. The invention will now be further described, by way of illustrative and non limiting example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which like references designate like elements and parts throughout, and in which Figure 2 is a block diagram showing a time base corrector in which a write clock pulse generator embodying this invention is employed. Figure 2 shows the overall circuit arrangement of a time base corrector TBC 1. A luminance signal Y and a chrominance signal C are reproduced, respectively, from different tracks of a record medium, such as a magnetic tape, by different magnetic heads and are fed to the time base corrector 1. The luminance signal Y is recorded on one of two adjacent tracks of the magnetic tape, while the chrominance signal C is formed of colour difference signals P Y and B Y which are time compressed to H 2 and are recorded on the other track. The frequency N₁f The reproduced luminance signal Y is converted to a digital signal by an analog to digital A D converter circuit 12 and then fed to a memory 13. The reproduced luminance signal Y also is fed to a synchronising separator circuit 14 in which a synchronising signal YSYNC and a burst signal YBUR are separated and then fed to a luminance signal write clock signal generator circuit 15. The write clock signal generator circuit 15 generates a clock signal YWCK which has a frequency of, for example, 910f When the memory control circuit 2 is supplied with the luminance write zero clear signal YWCR0, it specifies a write start address of the memory 13 and allows the memory 13 sequentially to store therein picture element data of the reproduced luminance signal Y by specifying memory areas of the memory 13 sequentially in synchronism with the write clock signal YWCK. The reproduced chrominance signal C is stored in a memory 23 by means of a circuit arrangement substantially similar to that described above. That is, the reproduced chrominance signal C is converted to a digital signal by an A D converter circuit 22 and then fed to the memory 23. The reproduced chrominance signal C also is supplied to a synchronising separator circuit 24 in which a synchronising signal CSYNC and a burst signal CBUR are separated and then fed to a chrominance write clock generator circuit 25. The write clock generator circuit 25 generates a clock signal CWCK1 having a frequency N₂f Accordingly, when the memory control circuit 2 is supplied with the chrominance write zero clear signal CWCR0, it specifies a write start address of the memory 23 and allows the memory 23 sequentially to store therein picture element data of the reproduced chrominance signal C by specifying memory areas sequentially in synchronism with the write clock signal CWCK1. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the chrominance write clock signal generator circuit 25 is constructed as shown in Figure 3, which is a block diagram showing in detail the construction of a section of the chrominance write clock generator circuit 25 for generating the write clock signal CWCK1. Referring to Figure 3, a voltage controlled oscillator VCO 30 generates an oscillatory output signal CWCK0 having the frequency N₂f In the phase shifter circuit 35, a sawtooth generator circuit 36 is supplied with the oscillatory output signal CWCK0 and generates a sawtooth waveform signal SAW Figure 4B which begins to increase its level starting from each leading edge of the oscillatory output signal CWCK0. The sawtooth waveform signal SAW is fed to one input terminal of a comparator circuit 37. The comparator circuit 37 is supplied at another input terminal with a When the The switching control signal CONT switches its logic level in such a manner that the rising time point t1 at which the phase displacement occurs may coincide with a start time point t1 of the colour difference signal B Y of the latter half of the reproduced chrominance signal C, as shown in Figure 1D. This may be achieved, for example, in that the number of pulses or periods of the oscillatory output signal CWCK0 from the VCO 30 is counted by a counter 39 and, when such number reaches a predetermined number, the logic level of the switching control signal CONT, which is produced by the counter, is inverted. The counter 39 is reset by, for example, the horizontal synchronising signal H. The timing at which the logic level of the control signal CONT is inverted such that the start time point t0 Figure 1D of the colour difference signal R Y is synchronised with the write clock signal CWCK1 can be detected on the basis of, for example, the chrominance write zero clear signal CWCR0. Consequently, as shown in Figure 1D, the chrominance write clock signal CWCK1 is generated for both of the colour difference signals R Y and B Y in synchronism with their start time points t0 and t1, so as to store the picture element data of the colour difference signals R Y and B Y, which are synchronised with each other, in the memory 23. Turning back to Figure 2, on the basis of a reference video signal VREF delivered from the outside, a signal generator circuit 3 generates a reference signal REF which is fed to a read clock generator circuit 4. The reference signal REF has a stable period. In response to the reference signal REF, the read clock generator circuit 4 generates a read clock signal RCK having a frequency N₂f When the memory control circuit 2 is supplied with the read zero clear signal RCR0, it specifies the memory area at the write start address as read address data for the luminance signal memory 13 and the picture element data stored in the memory 13 is read out sequentially in synchronism with the read clock signal RCK and then fed sequentially to a digital to analog D A converter circuit 16. The picture element data read out is converted to an analog signal YA by the D A converter circuit 16 and then fed to an adding circuit 5. When the memory control circuit 2 is supplied with the read zero clear signal RCR0 it specifies the memory area at the address in which the first picture element data of the colour difference signal R Y is stored and the memory area at the address in which the first picture element data of the colour difference signal B Y is stored as read address data for the chrominance signal memory 23. Thereafter, the picture element data DR of the colour difference signal B Y and the picture element data DB of the colour difference signal R Y stored in the memory 23 are read out and delivered alternately and sequentially to a frequency converter circuit 27 in synchronism with the read clock signal RCK. Thus, the reading out of the data is carried out at a period of ½ for the luminance signal Y. Accordingly, the time expanded and divided picture element data DR and DB are fed from the memory 23 to the frequency converter circuit 27. The frequency converter circuit 27 is supplied with a reference colour subcarrier signal SCR0 directly from the signal generator circuit 3 and also with a reference colour subcarrier signal SCR1 which is provided by phase shifting the signal SCR0 in a 90 The adding circuit 5 is operative to add the luminance signal YA, the time base of which was corrected, and the time expanded, divided and modulated in quadrature bi phase system carrier chrominance signal CA. The added signal from the adding circuit 5 is fed to a processor 6. In the processor 6, the synchronising signal SYNC and the burst signal BUR from the signal generator circuit 3 are added to the signal from the adding circuit 5 and the output level thereof is adjusted and then delivered as a composite video signal VOUT. According to the circuit arrangement described above, in synchronism with the synchronising signal YSYNC contained in the reproduced luminance signal Y, the picture element data of the reproduced luminance signal Y is converted to digital data by the A D converter circuit 12 while the time base fluctuation thereof is accompanied and then stored sequentially in the memory 13. The data is read out sequentially and fed to the D A converter circuit 16 in response to the read clock signal RCK having the stable period based on the reference signal REF. Thus, the luminance signal YA, the time base of which is corrected, is fed to the adding circuit 5. On the other hand, in synchronism with the synchronising signal CSYNC contained in the reproduced chrominance signal C, the picture element data of the reproduced chrominance signal C is converted sequentially to digital data by the A D converter circuit 22 while the time base fluctuation thereof is accompanied and then stored sequentially in the memory 23. The stored data is time expanded by the read clock signal RCK at every colour difference signal R Y and B Y component DR and DB and then fed to the frequency converter circuit 27. The data read out is balance modulated by the frequency converter circuit 27 in a digital fashion and fed to the D A converter circuit 26. Thus, the carrier chrominance signal CA, the time base of which is corrected, is supplied to the adding circuit 5. The reproduced luminance signal YA and the carrier chrominance signal CA with the time base corrected are added together by the adding circuit 5 and the synchronising signal SYNC and the burst signal BUR are added thereto by the processor 6, thus delivering the composite video signal VOUT from the output terminal. According to the time base corrector of Figure 2, using the chrominance write clock generator circuit 25 shown in Figure 3, even when the chrominance write clock signal CWCK1 has a frequency different from the frequency of the clock signal at the recording side, the write clock signal CWCK1 can be generated in synchronism with both start time points t0 and t1 of the colour difference signals R Y and B Y contained in the reproduced chrominance signal C, and synchronisation between the picture element data of the colour difference signals R Y and B Y stored in the memory 23 can be established. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the output video signal VOUT, which is modulated in accordance with an orthogonal bi phase system and then added to the luminance signal YA, from being displaced in colour. Figure 5 is a block diagram showing another embodiment of the present invention. In Figure 5, like parts corresponding to those of Figure 3 are designated by the same references and will not be described in detail. In the case of Figure 5, the chrominance write clock generator circuit 25 includes two phase shifter circuits 35A and 35B, each of which is formed of a sawtooth generator circuit and a comparator circuit as shown in Figure 3 . The phase shifter circuits 35A and 35B are operative to shift the oscillatory output signal CWCK0 from the VCO 30 and in this case, the shift amount of the phase shifter circuit 35B is selected to be large as compared with that of the phase shifter circuit 35A. The changing over of a switching circuit 39 is controlled by the switching control signal CONT such that when the colour difference signal R Y is reproduced, the output signal from the phase shifter circuit 35A is delivered, while when the colour difference signal B Y is reproduced, the output signal from the phase shifter circuit 35B is delivered. Accordingly, by controlling the timing of the switching of the switching circuit 39, the clock pulse generator circuit 25 generates the write clock signal CWCK1 shown in Figure 4D. When the clock pulse generator circuit 25 shown in Figure 5 is used, the colour difference signals R Y and B Y can be stored in the memory 23 in similar manner to the way in which this is accomplished in the case of the clock pulse generator circuit 25 of Figure 3, thus preventing the output video signal VOUT from being displaced in colour. While the above described embodiments employ a time compressed and multiplexed signal that is formed such that the colour difference signal R Y is time compressed and recorded in the first half H 2 of the horizontal interval, while the colour difference signal B Y is time compressed and recorded in the latter half thereof, the invention is not limited to a signal of the above form but can be applied to various other time compressed and multiplexed signals. For example, the invention can be applied to a time compressed and multiplexed signal in which the luminance signal Y and the colour difference signals R Y and B Y are recorded, respectively, on succeeding portions H 2, H 4 and H 4 of one horizontal period or interval. In short, regardless of the kind of time compressed and multiplexed signal, this invention can be applied to a case in which the sampling clock frequency N₂f According to the embodiments of the present invention as set forth above, since the sampling clock signals are generated in synchronism with the start time points of the respective component signals at the reproducing side, the respective component signals can be composed under the condition that the respective signals are synchronised with one another. Furthermore, even in apparatus in which the sampling clock frequency at the recording side and the sampling clock frequency at the reproducing side are different from each other, it is possible to obtain a synchronised video signal. Therefore, since the sampling clock frequency at the reproducing side is not restricted by the sampling clock frequency at the recording side, the same circuit arrangement can be applied to various reproducing apparatus.
