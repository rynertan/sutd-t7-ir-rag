# Semiconductor injection laser or intensifier.

## Abstract
A semiconductor laser or traveling wave intensifier having an active layer between two passive semiconductor layers, and a strip shaped electrode geometry. According to the invention the active layer is uniform in thickness, while at least one of the passive layers within the strip shaped geometry comprises a strip shaped zone of deviating construction and is built up from portions having different refractive indices n₁ and n₂. According to the invention it holds that n₁ n₂ d₁ d₂ 0, wherein n₁ is the refractive index of the portion which at least within said strip shaped zone adjoins the active layer, d₁ is the thickness thereof within the strip shaped zone, and d₂ is the thickness thereof beside the strip shaped zone.
