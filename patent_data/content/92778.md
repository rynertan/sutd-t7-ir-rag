# Process for preparing basic aluminum carbonate gels substantially free from foreign anions and fibrous colloidal alumina monohydrate of a boehmite crystal lattice structure.

## Abstract
A process is provided for preparing basic aluminium carbonate gels substantially free from foreign anions at a pH within the range from about 5.5 to about 7.0, according to the reactants used, and then converting such gels to high purity fibrous colloidal alumina monohydrate of the boehmite crystal lattice structure by hydrolysis with weak acids.
