# Angular velocity sensor.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a sensor 10 for sensing orthogonal components of angular velocity of rotation of the sensor about any axis in a plane perpendicular to a reference jet axis 12 within the sensor, wherein a fluid jet 14 is deflected relative to two pairs of electrically resistive, temperature sensitive elements 18, 20 in response to rotation of the sensor 10 , wherein each pair of elements 18, 20 forms the sensing branch of a bridge circuit, the jet deflection causing differential cooling and bridge unbalance which is an indication of the deflection of the fluid jet 14 from the reference jet axis 12 which is in turn an indication of the rate and direction of angular rotation, wherein each pair of elements 18, 20 is disposed in a plane perpendicular to the reference jet axis, 12 each pair sensing an orthogonal component of angular velocity of rotation.
