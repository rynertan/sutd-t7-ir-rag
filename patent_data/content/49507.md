# A process and apparatus for restructuring thin strip material, especially semi conductor material.

## Abstract
An apparatus and process for recrystallization of thin strip material 12 includes a device for electromagnetically melting the thin strip material to provide a molten surface layer 16 , and a substantially solid core 18 . An apparatus provides relative movement between the thin strip and the device 14 for electromagnetically melting. Also, an appar atus resolidifies the molten surface layer to provide a preferred crystal structure in the thin strip material. In addition, a process for restructuring thin strip semi conductor material is disclosed. It comprises the steps of providing relative movement between the thin strip material and the heating station. The thin strip material is heated at the heating station to a desired temperature between the recrystallization temperature and the melting temperature. The strip is maintained at the desired temperature whereby preferred recrystallization and stress relief occurs within the material. In addition, the thin strip material may be elongated through elevating the temperature of the thin strip and or increasing the longitudinal tension on the strip.
