# Safety support system.

## Abstract
A safety support system in which an annular safety support 70 of resilient foam material having an outer diameter less than the inner diameter of the tire 10 is positioned around a rim and within the tire 10 . The foam material has closed cells containing gas under pressure for supporting the tire 10 in the deflated condition and expand ing in an axial direction to press the bead portions 18 against the bead seats 100, 101 of the rim. The safety support 70 has beads 81, 84 and a fabric reinforced construction 86 at a radially outer wall for controlling expansion behyond the radially outer diameter. A second reinforcing fabric ply 88 may be provided at the radially inner wall 90 for controlling expansion and faciliating field mounting of the safety support 70 .
