# Method of operating electric power assisted steering systems and electric power assisted steering system.

## Abstract
An electro motive power steering system includes a torque sensor 6 208 for detecting a steering force exerted to a steering wheel 1 , a motor 7 202 controlled in accordance with the output of the torque sensor, a steering angle sensor 10 207 for detecting a a steering angle, acceleration deceleration deciding circuit 23 for deciding based on the outputs of the torque sensor and the steering angle sensor whether the steering of the steering wheel is accelerated or decelerated, and a function generator 24, 25 for generating a function of either one of acceleration or deceleration in accordance with the result of the decision by the acceleration deceleration deciding circuit, wherein a steering assisting force corresponding to the acceleration or deceleration of the steering of the steering wheel is applied to the steering wheel.
