# Apparatus and method for positioning subsequent recordings on a video tape relative to an existing recording.

## Abstract
A new automatic tracking method is disclosed for the accurate positioning of a magnetic head with information previously recorded on the magnetic tape. If a moveable magnetic head is used, the position thereof is first normalized. Thereafter tracking is automatically adjusted based on a repetitive sampling process in which the results are mathe matically averaged to determine a precise center position. Finally, new video material is physically positioned on the magnetic track according to a single offset error measurement.
