# Method of producing low expansion ceramic materials.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to low expansion cera mic material, the chemical composition of which consists of from 1.2 to 20 by weight of magnesia, from 6.5 to 68 by weight of alumina, from 19 to 80 by weight of titanium calculated as titanium dioxide , from 1 to 20 by weight of silica, and from 0.5 to 20 by weight of iron calculated as ferric oxide the major component of the crystalline phase of the material being a magnesium oxide aluminum oxide titanium dioxide silicon oxide iron oxide solid solu tion and the material having a coefficient of thermal ex pansion of not more than 20 10 ⁷ 1 C in the temper ature range 25 C to 800 C, a four point flexural strength of not less than 50 kg cm² at room temperature, and a melting point of not less than 1500 C. The material is pre pared by forming a batch of magnesia, alumina, titanium oxide, silica and iron oxide as such or in the form of pre cursors therefor capable of being converted thereto on fir ing plasticizing the batch if necessary and shaping the batch thus shaped and firing the shaped body at 1300 C to 1700 C. The ceramic material is suitably in the form of a honeycomb structure.
