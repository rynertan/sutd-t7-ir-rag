## Description
INTERFERON PRODUCTION This invention relates to an improved method for the production of human interferon. Interferon is the name given to glycoprotein which is produced by some cells in response to stimuli such as viral infection and interferon inducing agents such as natural or synthetic ribopolynucleotides. The increasing importance of interferon as a therapeutic agent in the management of viral infections such as Herpes types I and II and malignant diseases such as osteosarcoma has focused much attention on the problem of producing large quantities of interferon from cell cultures. The production of interferon in cell culture from normal cells with the aid of a simple inducer appears to be unsatisfactory for large scale production.One solution to this problem was to use high yielding abnormal cells, since it was found that transformed and tumor cell lines often produce high interferon yields. However, while interferon so produced may be satisfactory for non clinical purposes it is doubtful whether material produced in this way would be acceptable for medicinal purposes. A second solution is to try to enhance interferon yields from interferon producing cells. To date many different and indeed often conflicting methods have been suggested in the literature for improving interferon production from normal and abnormal cells. For example it has been suggested Y Tan et al, 1970, Proc NatlAcad Sci USA, 67, 464 J Vilcek et al, 1971, J Virol, 7, 588, and Y Tan et al, 1977, J Gen Virol, 34, 401 that the use of inhibitors of protein and RNA synthesis such as cycloheximide combined with actinomycin D is required to enhance production of interferon from some cell lines following induction with the synthetic polynucleotide polyinosinic polycytidylic acid poly IC .It has also been suggested that optimal results are obtained from other cell cultures by pretreating with interferon prior to induction with poly IC. In addition it has been reported A Meager et al, 1978, FEBS Letters, 87,303 that it is possible to improve interferon yields following induction with poly IC by treating certain human cell lines with 12 mM calcium chloride solution continuously for a period commencing 12 hours prior to induction and continuing for a period of 20 hours after induction when interferon is harvested. However, it is to be noted that the best interferon yields obtained by this method were given by a transformed cell line and osteosarcoma tumor cells, that is to say cells which do not possess the properties of normal human cells. It is recognised that while specific combinations of inducer and enhancer may be found to produce improved and high levels of interferon, the same enhancer may be completely unable to produce satisfactory levels of interferon with another inducer.Moreover to date no discernable rule emerges from the prior art which allows one to predict with confidence how improvements to interferon yields maybe obtained. It has now been discovered that particularly advantageous levels of interferon may be obtained when a natural double stranded ribonucleic acid is used in the presence of dissolved calcium to induce interferon from interferon producing human cells. Accordingly the invention provides a process for producing human interferon in vitro, which method comprises contacting interferon producing human cells with an interferon inducing medium comprising i a non toxic quantity of either a a double stranded ribonucleic acid of natural origin or b a double stranded derivative of a double stranded ribonucleic acid of natural origin, and ii from 10 to 25 mM dissolved calcium ions, under physiological condition of temperature and pH, and thereafter separating the interferon so formed. The term double stranded used in connection with ribonucleic acid refers to the characteristic whereby two ribonucleic acid molecules are associated by hydrogen bonding between complementary bases in each molecule.Ribonucleic acids may vary in the degree of double strandedness . The term double stranded ribonucleic acid of natural origin means any double stranded ribonucleic acid which is isolatable from a naturally occurring source eg those sources listed earlier in this specification , and excludes synthetic double stranded ribonucleic acids such as Poly IPoly C, Poly A Poly U and Poly G Poly C. The term double stranded derivative of a double stranded ribonucleic acid of natural origin means any double stranded ribonucleic acid of natural origin which has been subjected to a chemical or biochemical eg enzymatic reaction which alters the primary and or secondary and or tertiary structure eg the N oxides described in our British Patent No 1 284 150 or the alkali modified double stranded ribonucleic acids in our British Patent No 1 356 263 provided that the resultant derivative retains a substantial degree of base pairing between complementary strands. The double strandedness of a double stranded ribonucleic acid or a derivative of a double stranded ribonucleic acid can be measured by two parameters known as the hyperchromicity and Tm. These parameters are obtained by recording the ultra violet absorption of the material at 258 mp while gradually raising the temperature of the material. The u.v. absorption value of a double stranded material at this frequency increases with increasing temperature until a constant value is reached, corresponding to the absorption of the thermally denatured ie single stranded ribonucleic acid. The difference between the two extremes of absorption expressed as a percentage of the absorption of the double stranded material is termed the hyperchromicity of that material. When the u.v. absorption at 258 mp of a doublestranded material is plotted against temperature, it is found that the absorption is greater than at low temperatures. The temperatures at which the absorption is mid way between the absorption of the double stranded material and that of the thermally denatured ie single stranded material is called the Tm of the material. The term natural ds RNA in this specification means either double stranded ribonucleic acid of natural origin or a double stranded derivative thereof. Preferred sources of double stranded ribonucleic acid include the virus like particles found in certain of the Penicillia, eg P chrysogenum British PatentNo 1,170,929 , P stoloniferum Banks et al, Nature 218, 542 1968 , P cyaneofulyum Banks et al,Nature 223, 155 1968 , and in certain of the Aspergilli eg, A niger and A foetidus our co pending PatentApplication No 13826 70 . Preferably also the component a or b should be capable of inducing interferon production in live mammals. This can be confirmed by the method of Lampson et al. G P Lampson, A A Tytell,A K Field, N M Nemes and Mr Hillerman Proc Nat Acad Sci, 58 1967 , 782 . Additionally we have found that in vitro interferon production is further enhanced when induction is carried out in the presence of dissolved calcium and diethylaminoethyl dextran DEAE Dextran . Accordingly in a further aspect the invention provides a method for producing human interferon, which method comprises contacting interferon producing human cells with an interferon inducing medium comprising a non toxic quantity of natural ds RNA, not more than 1000 mg per litre of DEAE Dextran and not less than 10 but not more than 25 millimoles of dissolved calcium per litre, under physiological conditions of temperature and pH, and thereafter isolating the interferon so formed. In order to put this invention into practice it is generally most convenient to culture an appropriate quantity of cells by any of the standard techniques, and thereafter to treat the cell population with the inducer in the presence of dissolved calcium and optionally DEAE Dextran. The method of this invention may be put into effect with either normal or transformed cells, but it is preferrred to use normal cells since they produce clinical grade material. The method of this invention may be applied to cells which grow in monolayers. The monolayer culture technique requires that the cell is anchored to some mechanical support, such as a plate or bead, and supplied with a nutrient medium by submersion or perfusion while being mantained at a physiological pH and temperature. Methods for culturing cells in monolayer are also described by J Paul, loc cit. Alternative methods for culturing sheet forming cells have been decribed by A L van Wezel et al, Process Biochemistry, March 1978, 6 28 W Wohler et al, J Exptl Cell Res, 74, 1972, 571 Spier, Biotech Bioeng, 18, 649 689, 1976 and Belgian Patent No 842,002. Examples of suitable sheet forming cells include epithelial cells and fibroblasts. It is also preferred to put the method of the invention into practice using sheet forming cells, in particular diploid fibroblasts. MRC 5 diploid fibroblasts are preferred. Examples of suitable nutrient media include Eagle s, Fischer s, Ham s, Leibovitz , McCoy s, Neumann and Tytell s, Puck s, Swim s, Trowell s or Waymouth s medium, also 199, NCTC 109, NCTC 135, CMRL 1066, or RPML medium. When a confluent cell sheet is obtained, the cells are contacted with natural ds RNA in the presence of dissolved calcium. This may be done by draining off the nutrient medium used for culturing the cells and replacing it by an inducing medium which comprises a minimum essential medium containing the appropriate levels of dissolved calcium, natural ds RNA and preferably also DEAE Dextran. It should be noted that dissolved calcium ions are not required in the harvest medium to obtain the enhanced yield of interferon. Indeed, it is preferred that no additional calcium ions are included in the harvest medium in order to simplify separation of the interferon. Any water soluble non toxic calcium salt may be used in order to achieve the required concentration of dissolved calcium. For convenience, the chloride is preferred. Sufficient calcium salt must be added such that the dissolved calcium concentration is not less than 10 mmolar and not more than 25 mmolar, a concentration from 12 to 20 mmolar being more advantageous and a concentration from 15 to 20 mmolar being most apt. The quantity of natural ds RNA is not particularly critical to this invention, and appropriate quantities may be determined by trial and error. However, in general low concentrations, ie below 100 ugL , produce inconveniently low quantities of interferon, and at l higher concentrations for example above 100 mgL some toxic signs are observed in the cell culture. Of course the precise concentration at which natural ds RNA displays toxicity varies from cell line to cell line, but in general levels of natural ds RNS which produce substantial toxic effects should not be employed.Suitable concentrations of natural ds RNA lie in the range 0.1 to 50 mgL 1 inclusive, a concentration of 1 to 10 mgL 1 being most convenient. DEAE Dextran is a polymer of DEAE glucose of molecular weight between to 108. DEAE Dextran more suitable for use in the method of this invention generally has a molecular weight of 2 x 104 to 2 x 106.A number of DEAE Dextrans of different molecular weight are available commercially, or may be made by known methods. DEAE Dextran molecular weight 5 x 10 as supplied by Pharmacia is particularly convenient.The concentration of DEAE Dextran included in the induction medium will not exceed 1000 mgL 1 , 100 mgL being particularly convenient. The time for which the induction should be carried out will of course vary with the type of cell line employed, the concentration of inducer, dissolved calcium and DEAE Dextran. The optimum time for any particular set of circumstances may be conveniently determined by trial and error, that is to say by titrating the interferon harvested after a series of given time periods. The induction step is carried out under physiological pH conditions ie pH 6.5 to 8.0, and at a temperature in the range 20 400C, 34 38 being most apt. When the induction step is completed, the inducing medium is drained, optionally washed by contacting with a suitable nutrient medium, and thereafter contacted with a harvest medium. The harvest medium is left in contact with the cells until interferon production has ceased. Suitable harvest media include the nutrient media previously discussed. The length of time for which cells are left in harvest medium depends on the length of time for which the cell continues to produce interferon.This will, of course, vary depending upon the type of cell which is employed, but may be determined by titrating aliquots at given time intervals. When all interferon production has ceased, the harvest medium is drained from the cells, and the interferon recovered by standard techniques. The following Example illustrates this invention. Example MRC 5 cells were grown to confluency in 1.5 cm wells of Linbro tissue culture plates using 1.0 ml minimum essential Eagle s medium containing 8 foetal calf serum, 1 penicillin streptomycin solution Flow Laboratories and 2.2 gL sodium bicarbonate. After removal of growth medium the cultures were washed with phosphate buffered saline and incubated in 1.0 ml induction medium for 2 hours. Induction medium consists of minimum essential Eagle s medium containing 1 penicillin streptomycin solution, 2.2 gL 1 sodium bicarbonate and 10 mgL 1 BRL 5907 . DEAE Dextran Pharmacia 5 x 105 mol wt , where present, was used at 100 mgL . CaC12 was added from a 1 molL 1. sterile solution to give a final concentration in the induction medium of 10 20 mmolL At the end of the induction period, the induction medium was removed and replaced with 0.5 ml collection medium. Cultures were incubated for a further 20 hours. Collection medium consists of minimum essential Eagle s medium, 1 foetal calf serum, 1 non essentialamino acids, 1 penicillin streptomycin solution and 2.2 gL sodium bicarbonate. At the end of this second incubation period, the interferon containing collection medium was removed from the cultures and stored at 400C, until assay for human interferon by a modification of the assay for chick interferon reported by Viehhauser Viehhauser, G, 1977 Applied and Environ Microbiol, 33, 740 . The amounts of interferon produced in the presence and absence of CaC12 are shown in Table 1. BRL 5907 is a double stranded RNA isolated from virally infected strains of Penicillin chrysoqenum. Assay Method V3 monkey cells are grown to confluency in conventional roux bottles, and a cell suspension prepared by trypsinisation. The cell suspension is infected with Semliki Forest Virus, and aliquots of the suspension are dispensed into dilutions of the interferon samples unknowns and standards in 96 well microtitre plates. The plates are incubated for 3 days at 370C, before fixing the cells and staining with carbol fuchsin. The end point titre is the dilution of sample which results in the cells staining to 50 of the uninfected cell control cultures. The concentration of interferon in reference i.u. ml is calculated by comparison to the performance of a laboratory standard in the same assay. The laboratory standard is calibrated, in turn, against an NIH International standard.
