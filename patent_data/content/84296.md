# Container with a sliding open and close device for liquid or creamy products.

## Abstract
The container whatever its shape, and whether capable of being grasped or no, or whether rigid or flexible, squeeeable or otherwise is designed to contain liquids, or products having a creamy or paste like consistency, and is furnished with an open close device consisting of a slider 2 whose uppermost part is humped, so that when pushed by finger or thumb back and forth, a sliding motion is produced by dint of its pairing with a raised, or relief portion 5 located either at one corner of the container, or along one of its faces said raised portion being provided with a hole wherein a cylindrical body 7 incorporating the actual pourer orifice may be pushed to a tight grommet type fit. The pourer itself allows no passage out whatever of liquid, or cream or paste, once the slider is in closed position.

## Description
Container for cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, foodstuffs, detergents, and liquid, cream or paste products in general, with sliding open and close deviceThe invention relates to a container for cosmetic and pharmaceutical products, foodstuffs, detergents, as well as liquids and substances of a creamy or paste like consistency, having a sliding open close device in other words, a container incorporating a sliding mechanism by means of which to control the flow out of whatever product might be contained therein, be it liquid, viscous or non viscous, cream or paste1The prior art makes provision for phials or bottles for cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, foodstuffs and detergents liquid, cream or paste whence the substance may be extracted having once removed a cap and an inner seal in order to permit passage out of said substance, which can then be poured out into the palm of the hand, for instance, whereupon the phial or bottle may be set down in an upright position upon some convenient surface near to hand, before being taken up once again for further extraction of whatever substance is contained therein, or until such time as both user s hands are left free to perform the somewhat laborious operation of replacing its cap, which normally speaking involves grasping the said phial or bottle with one hand and screwing down the cap with the other,The prior art stands in need of further improvement with regard to the requirement for quick and simple re closing of the container with one hand only once having poured or shaken out the substance, before setting it down in any position upright or otherwiseupon some convenient surface level or no until such time as it may be re used or put away in a more suitable place or even left to drop into the bath water for a short while, in such a way that the substance therein is prevented from flowing out,The foregoing preamble evokes the need for solution of the technical problem posed by embodiment of a container furnished with a device which will permit opening and closing of the pour orifice speedly, and with one hand only, and which will allow for the said containerts being set down in any position whatever without occasioning leakage out of the substance duly contained therein.Moreover, the opening closing movement thus produced must needs be brought about at a single stroke and without a slip even by a wet or soapy handsThe invention resolves the problem outlined above by adopting a container of size and shape such as may be grasped in one hand similar, for instance, to a bar of soap, a small bottle, or even a tube and furnished with a slide type device invested with a hump backed longitudinal profile and worked back and forth by thumb or forefinger even when soapy or wet wilst the hand itself grips the container, thus opening and closing the orifice through which the substance contained therein may pour or flow outAdvantages obtained by the invention are speed and ease of manoeuvre, it being be possible to pour out the container s contents into one hand having opened the container at a single stroke, quiddy and without any difficulty, with the other the ability to set down or drop the container anywhere even in water with no fear of the substance seeping out from within also, a more efficient seal for liquids, and products of creamy or paste like consistency all this very much in direct contrast to traditional types of phial, bottle or tube, which offer no sure means of screwing down their relative cap with one hand only, and which therefore require a longer and more carefully effected closing operation in order to provide a true hermetic sealsA number of ways of embodying the invention are illustrated, by way of example, in the six sheets of drawings attached, wherein Figure 1 is the side view of a container in the form of a bar of soap, parallelepiped in shape, squeezable or rigid, with the open close device positioned at one corner Figure 2 is the view from the

trapezoidal embodied container Figure 21 is a part sectional frontal view of a fullysqueezable tube type container ewgg for creams, tooth paste, oily, and moreespecially, viscous substances with open close device located perpendicularly to the container longitudinal axis Figure 22 is the view from the left of Figure 21 Figure 23, is the frontil view of a container as in Figure 21, in this case having open close device located at an angle with respect to the longitudinal axis Figure 24 is the view from the right of Figure 23 With reference to the drawings 1 denotes the body of the container however shaped 2 denotes the open close devices slider whose longitudinal profile presents an upper hump backedn outline, the slider itself engaging and forming a sliding pair with a relief portion 5 offered by the container and exhibiting a flat top with raked sides, thus dovetailed when seen in cross sectiong Provision is made for a peripheral locking collar 3 located tightly about said portion 5 serving both to seal in the substance and embellish the package, perhaps by colour contrast The flat top 4 see Figure 5 of said relief portion 5 offers a through hole 6 for initial introduction of the paste, cream or liquid this in turn accomodating a self locking, grommet type plug whose cylindrical body 7 is provided with a longitudinal hole or orifice 8 affording controlled outflow of the substance within , and with a domed head 9 making for effective seal in of said substance during the course of its mating with the lower surface 10 of the open close slider 2. The final and effective seal of such liquid, cream or paste as the container may contain comes about with the insertion of a hemispherical protrusion It, issuing from lower surface 10 aforesaid, into orifice 8 at the latter s entry pointg A pair of peripheral rings indicated by 12 are located about said cylindrical body 7 thus establishing a labyrinth type seal, whether by close fit or compression, between said body and hole 6. A pair of protrusions issuing from the dove tailing internal flanks of slider 2 are indicated by 16 see Fi gure 6 1 denotes the matching pair of dove tailing guides formed from the flanks of relief portion 5 so as to create the longitudinal sliding pair aforementioned with guide flanks 13 presented thereto by slider 2. 15 denotes a pair of pins extending downward from the two downwardly directed side faces 16 of slider 2, these designed to slide within a corresponding pair of longitudinal recesses, os slots 17 located in similar fashion upon the matching side faces 18 of said collar 3, in such a way as to limit the degree of travel allowed to slider 2 thereby safeguarding against its separation from guides 14 A pair of relief portions shaped from the longitudinal ends 19 of said relief portion 5 serve to create respective unions with those parts of the container conjoining as it were, fore and aft of the open close device proper.A pair of notches 20 located in the base sections of relief portions 19 provide for said conjunction between the lower surface 21 of collar 3 see Figure 8 and the flat container section 22 whence said relief portion 5 is drawn up, even in those cases where body 1 of the container eAibits a raised centre seam or burr, either of necessity or through defective moulding.It should be observed that the hole 6, hence orifice 8, may be located concurrently with the longitudinal centreseam aforementioned, or may be offset to one side in any event it would be positioned to the fore for convenience s sakeg As will be seen from Figure 9, collar 3 may be eliminated by making provisions for a special relief portion 23 in container body 1 able ro assume the function thereof, being embodied as an integral part at the collar s would be conjunction with the container body fore and aft as aforesaid, and at the prescribed limits defining the travel of slider 2 slots 17 for the latter purpose being located in the top surface of relief 23 itself.The device to which the invention relates is used thus having grasped the container about body 1 with the device proper to the front, and orifice 8 directed upwards, the ball of the thumb urges either the front or the humped part of the slider 2 so as to draw the same back far enough to uncover orifice 8. The user now proceeds to pour out the paste, cream or liquid into the palm of his other, hand, for instance either by simply tipping the container forward or by squeezing same, whereupon the thumb is once again employed in pushing slider 2 forward far enough to ensure engagement of protrusion 11 with orifice 8, pressure this time exerted either on the hump of the slider or on its rear part.In this state, the actual container may be set down upon any surface, and in any position, without there being any outflow of the contents indeed the container may be descarded completely moreover, being hump backed, the slider 2 affords ample purchase to the ball of thumb, which may push confortably against the said jump even though wet or soaped whilst so doing without slipping. The opening and closing movement thus acconplished can also be brought about holding the container 1 between thumb and middle finger,in which case the forefinger will be employed in working the slider 2. When carrying through the closing movement, protrusion 11 issuing from the lower surface 10 of the slider snaps back into position in pourer orifice 8 after being drawn over the flat top 4 of relief portion 5. When carrying the invention into effetc, materials, dimensions, design, shape of the container and the actual profile of the slider 2 may all differ from as much described and illustrated, nonetheless retaining equivalent technical character and by no means iraying from within the bounds of protection afforded to the concept as supported by claims, for instance, container body 1 could be embodied as a hexagonal prism with the open close device located upon one of its lateral surfaces Likewise, the uppermost surface of slider 2 might incorporate a milled gripper, or thumbimpression, notwithstanding the latter feature is far from being indispensable1
