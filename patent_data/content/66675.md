## Description
FIELD EFFECT TRANSISTORS AND PROCESSES FOR THE FABRICATION THEREOF This invention relates to field effect transistors and processes for their fabrication. The speed or frequency response of field effect transistor type devices is limited by the transit time of the carriers electrons or holes depending on the substrate doping and the capacitance of the gate. Efforts in the art have been made to fabricate short channel field effect transistors in order to reduce the transit time and capacitance of the gate. However, the processes suggested in the prior art are somewhat complicated and not especially reliably reproducible.Exemplary techniques attempted or suggested for providing short channelFETs involve the relative etching rates of metals and silicon dioxide, overlapping gate structures, serial diffusions, and converging crystallographic plane preferential etching. The present invention seeks to provide a simple method for providing a narrow control gate field effect transistor. The narrow control gate is the region of the transistor which is most closely adjacent to its channel region which lies between a source region and a drain region. The maximum width of the narrow control gate o is about 3000 A. A process of fabricating a field effect transistor having source and drain regions of one conductivity type separated by a channel region of the opposite conductivity type, the process including forming a thin gate oxide layer over said channel region and being characterised, according to the invention, by providing a recess with a vertical sidewall in said gate oxide layer, vapour depositing metal in the recess in said gate oxide at such an angle that a thicker metal deposit is formed on said vertical sidewall than on the remainder of the recess and etching away the metal in the recess so as to leave only a metal coating on the sidewall and providing an electrical connection to that metal coating in order that it can serve as a narrow control gate for the field effect transistor. The invention also provides a field effect transistor having source and drain regions of one semiconductor conductivity type separated by a channel region of the opposite conductivity type, a narrow control gate formed over and closely adjacent to the channel region and an overlap gate formed over the narrow control gate and the channel region, characterised in that the narrow control gate has a maximum width of 3000 A. How the invention can be carried out will now be described by way of examp le, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figs. 1.1 1.6 represent cross sections, taken along the lines 1 1 indicated in Fig. 2, of a field effect transistor at various successive stages of fabrication by a process embodying the invention. Fig. 2 represents a plan of a field effect transistor device fabricated by a method embodying the invention. For convenience, the discussion of the fabrication steps is directed to the use of a p type silicon substrate and n type carriers electrons with n type source and drain regions. This results in the production of n channel FETs. Alternatively, an n type substrate and p type diffused or implanted dopant impurities in the source and drain regions can be used to produce p channel FETs. The invention is applicable to substrates other than silicon.Also, as used herein, the terms metallic type interconnection lines or high conductivity interconnection lines refer to metal lines, such as aluminium as well as non metallic materials e.g. highly doped polysilicon or intermetallic silicides which, nevertheless, can have conductivities of the magnitude generally possessed by conductive metals.Also, when reference is made to impurities of a first type and to impurities of a second type , the second type refers to the opposite conductivity type than the first type . That is, if the first type is p, then the second type is n. If the first type is n, then the second type is p. Also, for convenience, the discussion of the fabrication steps refer to photolithography. However, other lithographic techniques, such as electron beam systems, can be employed when desired. Moreover, although the discussion which follows refers to wet chemical etching, it is understood that other etching techniques, such as reactive ion etching, can be used when desired. Although, the fabrication process is described employing the preferred material, aluminium, as the control gate, other materials can be employed to provide the control gate. In particular, the control gate can also be fabricated from refractory metals or their silicides in addition to aluminium. A refractory metal is understood within the context of the present application to be a metal which can withstand the high temperatures experienced during the fabrication without degrading to an undesired extent. Examples of some suitable refractory metals include tungsten, tantalum, hafnium, and rhodium. Examples of some suitable silicides include tungsten silicide, tantalum silicide, hafnium silicide, and rhodium silicide. Referring to Fig. 1.1, a p type silicon substrate 2 having any desired crystal orientation e.g. 100 is prepared by slicing and polishing a p type boule grown in the presence of a p type dopant, such as boron, following conventional crystal growth techniques. Other ptype dopants for silicon include aluminium, gallium, and indium. Field oxide isolation 12 can be fabricated by any of several known procedures including thermal oxidation of the semiconductor substrate or by well known vacuum or chemical vapour deposition techniques. Furthermore, the field oxide may be formed above the semiconductive surface or it may be partially or fully recessed into the semiconductor substrate.An example of one such procedure is the fully recessed oxide isolation technique disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,899,363. For the purpose of illustration of the procedure of the present invention, a non recessed field isolation oxide will be used. The field isolation regions are generally about 4,000 to about 10,000 angstroms thick. The field oxide regions 12 and the regions under which source and drain regions 4 and 5 are formed are delineated by employing a lithographic mask. The mask is of a transparent material having opaque portions in a predetermined pattern. Next, source and drain regions 4 and 5 are formed in the p silicon substrate 2, such as by thermal diffusion or ion implantation of an impurity of the n type. Examples of some n type impurities for a silicon substrate include arsenic, phosphorus, and antimony. Using a photolithographic technique, the field oxide 12 is etched from an area where a thin gate oxide insulator layer 3 Fig. 1.2 is to be subsequently grown. The relatively thin gate insulator layer of silicon dioxide 3 is grown or deposited onto the silicon substrate 2. This gate insulator, which is usually about 100 to 1,000 angstroms thick, can be formed by thermal oxidation of the silicon surface at 10000C in the presence of dry oxygen. Next, a masking material 6 Fig. 1.3 is deposited over the structure. A preferred material is aluminium which is preferably deposited by known evaporation techniques. A preselected hole is then etched into the masking layer 6 by known techniques, thereby forming a mask for subsequent etching of the oxide layer 3 which has been exposed by the removal of the masking material. For instance, the aluminium can be etched with an etchant composition containing about 1 part by volume of nitric acid, about 4 parts by volume of water, and about 20 parts by volume of phosphoric acid. Such an etch can be accomplished at room o temperature with about 2.6 A being removed per second. Next, a recess is formed in the oxide layer 3, as illustrated inFig. 1.4, by etching the oxide, preferably by reactive ion etching, to remove oxide not protected by the aluminium layer. The etch employed should be a directional etching procedure to produce a well defined step in the oxide. Preferably, the amounts etched away should be about onehalf of the total thickness of the oxide layer. Typical conditions of reactive ion etching include using a CF4 gas at about 25 microns of pressure at a gas flow rate of about 40 standard cubic centimetres per minute and employing about 20 watts of power which is equivalent to a 2 power density of about 0.073 watts per cm . These particular parameters o provide for an etch rate of about 160 A per minute. The remaining masking layer 6 is then stripped away. For instance, in the case of aluminium, the above described etching composition can be employed. An alternative procedure is to fully etch the Sio, down to the 2 underlying silicon and subsequently to regrow a thin gate oxide. For o instance, a 1000 A gate oxide might be completely etched by this procedure o and a 500 A oxide regrown. This procedure would also produce the desired recess in the gate oxide layer. Next, a metal 15 see Fig. 2 is deposited on the sample. The metal layer is lithographically defined to form a contact pad for the subsequent thin metal control gate to external circuitry. Next, a metal 7 is deposited, preferably by evaporation, angularly such that a thicker metal deposit is provided adjacent one sidewall of the recess as compared to that over the horizontal surface of the oxide.The angle of evaporation should be greater than 450 from the normal to the horizontal surface of the oxide, and preferably is a least about 600. The larger the angle, the better the process. The angle is less than 900, and preferably as close to 900 as is possible to deposit the metal. The most preferred angle range is about 600 to about 800. The difference between the thickness of the metal deposited on the horizontal surface of the oxide and that on the sidewall is a sine cosine relationship. For instance, at an evaporation angle of about 800, the ratio of the thickness of the metal deposited on the sidewall to that deposited on the horizontal surface is about 5.7 1. Any process for directional deposition of metal, such as vapour deposition, can be employed. Preferred metals include aluminium and gold. In a typical application, the metal is deposited to provide a o thickness of about 100 to 5000 A adjacent the sidewall. It is preferred that the thickness of the metal adjacent the sidewall be equal to about the height of the sidewall. The thickness adjacent the sidewall is preferably at least twice that on the surface. In a particular embodi o ment, about 700 A thickness of aluminium is deposited on the sidewall at o an 809 angle. In such instance, about 120 A thickness of aluminium is deposited on the surface. In order to provide the thin gate, the surface aluminium coverage is then etched off, leaving a residual aluminium coating on the sidewall of the oxide. Since the aluminium is thicker adjacent the sidewall, etching of the aluminium on the vertical surfaces results in leaving an amount of aluminium which is sufficient to provide the thin gate. For instance, the device gate for the above dimensions discussed would be o about 500 A. The gate so formed will be referred to herein as the control gate. The etching of the aluminium can employ the particular etching parameters discussed hereinabove for the initial etch requirements. It is preferable that the etching be somewhat controlled and slow so as not to remove more than necessary from the sidewall of the structure.Typical device gate lengths are up to about 3000 A, preferably at least O O about 60 A. Preferably, the device gate is about 100 to about 1000 A long. Next a photoresist not shown is applied to the thin metallic device gate adjacent the step in the oxide layer to protect it from subsequent etching procedure which is to remove metal from the other portions of the structure whereby the metal still remains. Any known photoresist can be employed. Next, the metal remaining on other portions of the structure, such as aluminium, is removed by etching, such as using an etch composition and conditions of the type discussed hereinbefore. Silicon oxide layer 8 Fig. 1.5 is then deposited over the entire structure, such as by employing chemical vapour deposition. In the alternative, a plasma oxide deposition can be employed. Next, an overlap gate 9 is delineated on top of the oxide and on top of the control gate by photolithographic techniques well known in the art. The overlap gate is preferably an electrically conductive metal, such as aluminium. The length and width of the overlap gate should be sufficient to overlap the source and drain regions. In fabricating FET integrated circuits, it is necessary to connect high electrical conductivity lines to the source, drain and control gate regions 4, 5 and 15 of the device. The electrical connections are fabricated by applying a photoresist layer to the assembly. The resist materials are exposed with ultraviolet radiation using a lithographic masking pattern, and the exposed regions of the resist are dissolved away. Next, the structure is treated to remove the portions of the oxide not protected by the resist material. For instance, the structure is immersed in a solution of buffered hydrofluoric acid to provide contact holes or vias Fig. 1.6 through the oxide insulation layers 8 and 3 to allow electrical connection to be made to the source and drain of the FET and through the oxide insulation layer 8 to allow electrical connection to be made to the control gate.In Fig. 1.6, oxide layers 3 and 12 are shown as one layer 14 for convenience purposes. The remaining photoresist above the etched silicon dioxide is then removed by dissolving in a suitable solvent. Next, the metallic type high electrical conductivity interconnection line material 11, preferably a metal, is deposited and the interconnection pattern is delineated. An example of a highly conductive material commonly used for interconnections is aluminium. The high electrical conductivity material, such as aluminium, may be deposited by sputtering or, preferably, by evaporation. Next, a photoresist layer not shown is applied to the assembly.The resist material is exposed with ultraviolet radiation using a predetermined mask pattern and the exposed regions of the resist are dissolved away. Then the structure is treated to remove the portions of conductive material not protected by the resist. In operation of this short channel FET, the overlap gate is biased with a constant voltage Vo which is sufficient to invert the surface of the semiconductor change the type of the carriers under the gate under the overlap gate. This provides the electrical contact between the source and drain regions and the control gate region. Next, an applied voltage Vc to the control gate will control the flow of current between source and drain as in a conventional FET. Depending on the exact parameters used in fabrication substrate doping level, oxide thickness, control gate width, etc. and the overlap gate bias voltage Vo, the device will operate in either depletion or enhancement mode.
