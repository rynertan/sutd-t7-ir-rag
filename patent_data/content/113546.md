# Automated system monitoring using frequency and amplitude modulation.

## Abstract
This invention teaches apparatus for monitoring an operating condition of a machine by a composite audio signal. In automatic assembly or processing operations employing multiple machines or robots, a signal pre processor employing frequency and amplitude modulation techniques translates a plurality of monitored condition signals associated with each machine or robot into a composite audio signal. The time varying composite audio signal represents a unique audio signature of the status of the assembly or process operation at any given time. This composite audio signal is available for analysis by an operator or an audio recognition system to detect variations in the composite audio signal which identify impending operational irregularities in the process being performed.
