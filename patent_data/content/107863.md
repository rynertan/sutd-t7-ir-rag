# A shielding material of electromagnetic waves.

## Abstract
The shielding material of electromagnetic waves of the invention is formed of a polymeric material as the matrix and an inorganic powder, e.g. mica flakes, metallized on the surface of the particles with a metal e.g. nickel, as the conductive dispersant in the matrix. The metallization of the inorganic powder is performed by chemical plating, preferably, after pretreatment with an organic compound having a functional group capable of capturing ions of a noble metal and then with a solution containing a noble metal, preferably, palladium. This pretreatment is effective to increase the firmness of bonding between the metallizing layer and the surface of the particles so that the shielding effect of the material is greatly improved.
