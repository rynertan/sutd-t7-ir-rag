## Description
A PROCESS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF AUTOCLAVED FIBRE REINFORCED SHAPED ARTICLES The present invention relates to a process for the manufacture of autoclaved fibre reinforced shaped articles having a density of at least 600 kg per m3 with a matrix of cured calcium silicate binder, comprising the steps of initially preparing an aqueous slurry of fibres, silica, lime and or lime containing material and possibly other additives and containing an excess of water in relation to the amount necessary to secure curing of the calcium silicate binder, and subsequently forming green shaped articles by dewatering the slurry, and finally autoclaving the green shaped articles, possibly after pressing and precuring. By the term lime is meant CaO and or Ca OH 2. By lime containing material is understood material which contains lime, and material which liberates lime in the presence of water such as cement, in particular hydraulic cement, e.g. Portland cement.By autoclaving is meant heat treatment in the presence of saturated steam at superatmospheric pressure. Processes of this kind are known in connection with the manufacture of asbestos fibre reinforced autoclaved products, such as flat or corrugated panels, sheets and boards used for e.g. roofing and exterior and interior cladding of buildings. A typical example is mentioned in US A 3 501 323, which mentions a typical mixture of 15 weight percent asbestos fibres, 51 weight percent Portland cement as lime containing material and 34 weight percent ground sand as silica . A free flowing aqueous slurry is prepared from this mixture, whereafter green sheets are prepared by dewatering said slurry. These sheets are pressed and autoclaved, typically at 1700C for 8 hours. Similar processes using hydrated lime, Portland cement or mixtures thereof as lime and or lime containing material ground quartz, silica sand, diatomite or fly ash as silica, typically having a specific surface area within the range 2 1000 12000 cm g, preferably within the range 3000 5000 cm g and fibres of asbestos, silica, glass, cellulose and or organic polymers, are also mentioned in US A 3 501 323. Another process of the same kind for the production of asbestos free products using e.g. 12 weight percent cellulose fibres, 15 weight percentPortland cement, 31.8 weight percent lime, 29.2 weight percent ground quartz and 12 weight percent mica is known from the specification of US A 4 101 335, and a similar process using 40 60 weight percent cement, 30 40 weight percent ground quartz and 5 15 weight percent cellulose fibres is also known from the specification of EP A 68741. The object of the present invention consists in providing a process of the above kind for the manufacture of products, such as flat or corrugated panels, sheets and boards used e.g. for roof ing and exterior and interior cladding of buildings and as interior building elements in ships, having a particularly hgh strength relative to their density, low permeability, high frost resistance and high flexibility. it has now surprisingly been found that the object can be achieved by a process for the manufacture of autoclaved fibre reinforced shaped articles having a density of at least 600 kg per m3 with a matrix of cured calcium silicate binder comprising the steps of initially preparing an aqueous slurry of fibres, silica, lime and or lime containing material and possibly other additives and containing an excess of water in relation to the amount necessary to secure curing of the calcium silicate binder, and subsequently forming green shaped articles by dewatering the slurry, and finally autoclaving the green shaped articles, possibly after pressing and precuring, which is characterized in that the aqueous slurry, calculated on a dry weight basis, contains 5 30 , preferably 8 20 , in particular 12 16 fibres, including at least 5 , preferably at least 8 cellulose fibres 15 50 , preferably 18 35 , in particular 18 25 silica in the form of ultra fine silica dust with a specific surface area of 5 200 m2 g and a particle average diameter less than about O.5jw , 20 80 , preferably 30 70 , in particular 45 65 lime and or lime containing material and 0 40 additives. The shaped articles formed by the process according to the invention exhibit particularly high strengths relative to their density. This is probably due partly to the unusually high fibre content and partly to the fact that the use of the ultra fine silica dust having an extremely high specific surface area as silica leads to an unusually high reactivity of the starting material and also to a particularly dense packing of the starting material in the green sheets, resulting in a matrix in the autoclaved product which is unusually compact as compared with a matrix obtained by use of coarser silica, such as diatomite or ground quartz. The high reactivity of the starting material also offers the possibility of performing autoclaving at low temperatures, if desired. The high concentration of fibres, including at least 5 , preferably at least 8 cellulose fibres is of crucial importance to ensure fair filtration conditions and high homogeneity of the green shaped articles, which is necessary for the production of a satisfactory end product. By the process according to the invention it is thus possible to manufacture flat boards with a MOR defined below of 20 60 MPa at densities of 0.9 1.6 g cm . Preferred fibres are synthetic inorganic fibres, such as mineral wool, glass, carbon and steel fibres synthetic organic fibres, such as polyester, polyvinyl, polyvinylalcohol, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyacrylonitrile and polyacrylamide fibres and natural organic fibres, such as cellulose fibres. As mentioned above, the aqueous slurry must contain at least 5 , preferably at least 8 , calculated on a dry weight basis, cellulose fibres.These are preferably selected from wood fibres of e.g. birch, pine and spruce seed and fruit hair fibres of e.g. coir and cotton and leaf and or bast fibres of e.g. sisal, abaca, flax, hemp and jute. The fibres serve partly to reinforce the autoclaved product, partly as filtration and retention aids at the dewatering step. Particularly satisfactory filtration and retention are obtained when at least a part of the cellulose fibres is refined to a degree of freeness of 20 600 SR and or when the fibres include highly fibrillated polyethylene or polypropylene fibres. Very favourable results can be obtained if the fibres are exclusively cellulose fibres. A particularly preferred embodiment is characterized in that the aqueous slurry, calculated on a dry weight basis, contains 8 20, preferably 12 168 cellulose fibres, and that up to 50 of these cellulose fibres are refined to a degree of freeness of 20 60 SR, particularly 35 500 SR. The ultra fine silica dust is preferably fine filter dust from electrothermal production of silicon or ferro silicon with a specific surface area of about 25 m2 g and an average particle diameter of about O.lt. The lime and or lime containing material may be hydrated lime, hydraulic cement such as Portland cement, e.g. of the type I V, according to ASTM standard C 150, and mixtures thereof. The additives if present may be selected from fillers including mica, vermiculite, kieselgur, perlite, expanded clay, diatomite and ground quartz, silica sand and fly ash colouring agents water sealing agents setting and hardening accelerators including calcium chloride and aluminium sulphate flocculants and dispersants filtering agents including.acicular Wollastonite crystals and organic and inorganic plasticising and fibre dispersion agents, including colloidal hydrophilic inorganic particles, e.g. hydrophilic silica particles with a specific surface. area larger than 100 mê g and refined and unrefined colloidal clay particles. The autoclaving is preferably performed at temperatures between 100 and 2400C, preferably within the interval 130 190 C. The aqueous slurry can be prepared in a manner known per se by pulping and stirring the fibres in water and subsequently admixing the remaining materials, possibly adding more water to reach a suitable water solid ratio. When pulping cellulose fibres it has, however, been found particularly advantageous initially to disperse the ultra fine silica dust in water having a pH vlue exceeding 8, subsequently stirring the fibres in this aqueous silica dispersion and finally admixing the remaining materials and, if necessary, additional water. Hereby is ensured a particularly homogeneous slurry of the fibres with a reduced tendency to lump formation, presumably because the ultra fine silica dust in a basic environment will coat.the surface of the individual cellulose fibres, providing an increased dispersibility of the cellulose fibres. The preparation of the green shaped articles by dewatering the slurry takes place in a manner.known per se, e.g. using the Hatschek, Magnani, Head Box, injection or Fourdrinier method. The green shaped articles can, for example, be shaped as beams, blocks, pipes and flat or corrugated panels, boards and sheets which, if desired, can be subjected to compression, typically at a pressure of 10 100 kgf cmê, and precuring, typically at 20 1000C for 6 24 hours and a relative humidity of 60 100 , before the autoclaving. When shaping the green shaped articles plasticity is a particularly desirable property. It has been found that excellent plasticity is obtained by the process according to the invention due to the use of the ultra fine silica dust as silica, and that the plasticity of the material increases with addition of lime. The invention is further illustrated in theExamples. The materials, used in the examples were as follows Fibres AO cellulose Cellulose fibres Pinus Kraft cellulose length less than 4 mm, diameter about 35 m.BO cellulose Bleached cellulose fibres Betula having a degree of freeness about 43 50 .SR, length about 1.3 mm, diameter about 30 m.EO cellulose Bleached cellulose fibres Eucalyptus grandis and Eucalyptus urophylla having a degree of freeness of about 200 SR, length about 1.0 mm, diameter about 20 m.Abaca Cellulose fibres Musa , length about 6 mm, diameter about 30 m.Flax Cellulose fibres Linum having a degree of freeness of about 350 SR, length about 6 mm, diameter about 1 5.

Fibre reinforced sheets were prepared in the laboratory at bench scale and on Hatschek andMagnani machines at full industrial, scale. Bench scale experiments Production Procedure.Pulp preparation A solution saturated at 200C was prepared of Ca OH 2 and CaS04.2H20 in deionized water. A portion of this solution together with the desired amount of ultra fine silica dust were introduced into a British Pulp Evaluation Apparatus, and the silica was dispersed for 3 min. at 3000 r.p.m. Then the fibres were added to the dispersion, and the mixture was pulped fpr 15 min.at 3000 r.p.m. Slurry preparation The resulting fibre pulp along with an additional portion of the above saturated solution were transferred to the vessel of a Diaf mixer, and the slurry was prepared by adding lime and or lime containing material and optional additives in an amount corresponding to a weight ratio water to total solid material equal to 10.The resulting mixture was stirred at 4000 r.p.m. for 6 min.Preparation of green sheets A portion of the slurry corresponding to 109 g solid material was dewatered in a filtration apparatus, suction pressure 200 mm Hg. The resulting filter cakes we re pressed to green sheets in a Johns Manville sheet forming press.Preparation of hardened sheets The green sheets were cured to hardened sheets in the following way The green sheets were placed on a glass plate and kept in a humidity box for 24 hours, relative humidity about 95 , temperature 250C. Thereafter the sheets were autoclaved with a heating up time of 2.5 hours, held for 16 hours and a cooling time of 2.5 hours. The physical properties of the slurry and the hardened sheets were measured as described below Testing Procedure Filtration time A portion of slurry corresponding to 109 g of solid material was dewatered in a filtration apparatus at a suction pressure equal to 200 mm Hg A sudden drop in suction pressure indicates the end of the filtration period. The filtration time is defined as the period of time from start of suction to pressure drop. Loss of solids The particle retention properties of the slurry were measured in the following way 3 times 440 g portions of slurry were dewatered in a filtration apparatus provided with a 40 mesh sieve, suction pressure . 30 mm Hg. The content of solid material in the filtrate was filtered out from the filtrate and the weight thereof determined. Loss of solids is defined as the percentage by weight of solid material in the filtrate compared with total amount of solids.MOR dry and wet The autoclaved sheets were subjected to bending tests in which the curvature of the specimens was determined as a function of the load A ZW ICK 1454 testing machine with 4 point load with a support distance of 190 mm and a 35 mm arm of momentum was used. Force deformation curves were registered. MOR, modulus of rupture, designates the maximum tensile stress in bending at maximum load. Attribution wet designates that measurements were made on watersoaked sheets which had been submerged in water for 48 hours, and dry designates that measurements were made on sheets which had been dried at 1100C for 48 hours.Example 1.Comparison between sheets prepared according oto.the invention and sheets prepared according to the known art Three series of experiments were performed with production of sheets according to the ProductionProcedure. In experiment 1 sheets based on ultra fine silica dust were produced according to the invention. The green sheets were pressed at 15, 100 and 50 kgf cm2 and autoclaved at 1400cm 140 C and 180 0C, respectively. By way of comparison sheets were produced in experiments 2 and 3 according to the known art in which ACE sand and fly ash, respectively, was used as silica. The green sheets were presed at 50 kgf cm2 and autoclaved at 18O0C. Compositions, calculated in percent by weight of total solid material, and test results are shown inTable I. It is evident that the sheets produced according to the invention exhibit extremely superior strength properties. Further, it is seen that the strength properties improve with increasing compression pressure.Example 2.Incorporation of fly ash as a component in the binder Seven series of experiments were carried out with production of sheets according to theProduction Procedure. In experiment 4 fly ash free sheets were produced based on ultra fine silica dust. In experiment 5 part of the ultra fine silica dust was replaced by fly ash, while in experiment 6 there were produced sheets according to the known art in which fly ash exclusively was used as silica. Compositions, in weight percet calculated on total solid material, compression pressure and test results are shown in Table II. The autoclaving temperature was 140 0C. It is evident that the sheets produced according to the invention exhibit extremely superior strength properties. Further, it is seen that partial replacement of ultra fine silica by fly ash leads to impaired strength properties. In experiments 7 10 the amount of ultra fine silica dust used in experiment 4 was maintained, whereas the cement was replaced by increasing amounts of fly ash and lime hydrate. Compositions, compression pressure and test results are shown in Table II. The autoclaving temperature was 1400C. Comparison of the results of experiments 4 and 7 10 shows that a high silica content ensures excellent strength properties also when, considerable portions of the cement are replaced by fly ash. It was further observed that the addition of lime hydrate had an advantageous plasticising effect on the green sheets.Example 3.Addition of various types of cellulose fibres Three series of experiments were performed with production of sheets according to the invention, Experiment 11 is identical with experiment 4.In experiments 12 and 13 the fibres used in experiment 11 were replaced by other fibre combinations. Compositions, in weight percent calculated on total solid material, compression pressure and test results are shown in table III. The autoclaving temperature was 14O0C. It is evident that the products produced in all the series of experiments have excellent strength properties.Example 4.Use of various kinds of cement. Three series of experiments were performed with production of sheets according to the invention. Experiment 14 is identical with experiment 4.In experiments 15 and 16 the LSC cement used in experiment 14 was replaced by other types of cement. Compositions, in.weight percent calculated on total solid material, compression pressure and test results are shown in Table IV. The autoclaving vemperature was 14O0C. It is evident that the products produced in all the series of experiments have excellent strength properties. Example 5.Effect of incorporation of Wollastonite crystals. Two series of experiments were performed with production of sheets according to the invention, experiment 17 without experiment 18 with addition of Wollastonite crystals. Compositions, in weight percent calculated on total solid material., compression pressure and test results are shown in Table V. The autoclaving temperature was 140 C. The test results show that the incorporation ofWollastonite crystals results in considerable reduction in the filtration time and in the solid material loss with substantially unchanged strength properties.Example 6.The effect of fibre concentration on strength properties. Eight series of experiments were performed with production of sheets according to the ProductionProcedure. In experiment 19 sheets were produced with a fibre content of 4 , i.e. lower than the minimum claimed in Claim 1. In experiments 20 and 21 sheets were produced according to the invention with 12 and 15 fibres, respectively. These sheets were pressed 2 at 15kgf cm and autoclaved at 140 C. In experiments 22 26 sheets were produced with cellulose fibre contents increasing from 5 to 30 . Compositions, in weight percent calculated on total solid material, compression pressure, autoclaving tempe.rature and test results are shown in Table VI. The test results show that a high cellulose fibre content is necessary in order to obtain excellent strength properties for products having a rather low density and fair filtration conditions.It is further seen that the optimal cellulose fibre content is within the range 10 20 .Example 7.Effect of silica concentration on strength properties. Six series of experiments were performed with production of sheets according to the invention. In experiments 27 32 sheets were produced with a content of ultra fine silica dust increasing from 20 40 . Compositions, in weight percent calculated on total solid material, compression pressure, autoclaving temperature and test results are shown in Table VII. The test results show that a favourable combination of excellent strength properties and acceptable filtration times are obtained when the content of ultra fine silica dust lies within the range 18 358. Industrial experiments.Example 8.Experiment on a full scale Hatschek machineExperiment Hl. 178 kg BO cellulose were pulped for 10 min. with 3200 litres of water in a 6m3 Solvo hydro pulper.The resulting pulp was refined in a Black Clawson disc refiner to a degree of freeness of 450 SR. 550 kg ultra fine silica dust were dispersed in 4000 litres of water for 10 min. Thereafter 204 kg AO cellulose were added, and the mixture was pulped for 20 min. 4754 kg of this pulp were mixed with the first pulp and further water was added to a total weight of 8600 kg. 1845 kg of the resulting pulp were mixed with 300 kg LSC cement for 10 min.Thereafter water was added in order to obtain a water to solid material ratio equal to about 10. The resulting slurry was in known manner processed into flat boards on a Hatschek machine. The flat boards were pressed for 45 60 min. The pressed boards which had a thickness of 6 mm were cured in a curing channel at 600C for 8 hours. Then the boards were autoclaved at 14006 for 16 hours, preceded by a heating up time of 4 hours and followed by a cooling time of 4 hours. Testing. Two values of the MOR of the boards were measured MOR 1 with rupture parallel to the direction of production . MOR t with rupture perpendicular to the direction of production . The designations wet and dry are the same as stated above, stock refers to the fact thatthe boards after the autoclaving have been conditioned for about 1 month under atmospheric conditions prior to measurement. Compositions, in weight percent calculated on total solid material, compression pressure and test results are shown in Table VIII. Experiment S2 Analogously sheets according to the invention were prepared with a binder based on hydrated limey Composition, in weight percent calculated on total solid material, compression pressure and test results are shown in Table VIII. The boards were tested for water permeability, and the results demonstrated a reduction in permeability by a factor of approximately 10 compared with ordinary asbestos cement. Further the boards were subjected to frost thaw tests and here again the results were significantly better than for ordinary asbestos cement. After exposure for 1 hot r in water and subsequently 23 hours at 60 n dry heat with 50 repetitions the strength properties of the boards remained unchanged. The ability of the boards to protect flammable material behind them against fire was demonstrated as being equal to that of asbestos cement.Experiment H3 and 114. Analogously sheets according to the invention were prepared with binders based on LSC cement containing flax cellulose and AO cellulose, respectively. Compositions, in weight percent calculated on total solid materials, composition pressure and test results appear from Table VIII.Experiment H5 Corrugated sheets were produced at full industrial scale in the following way A slurry having the same composition as in Experiment H4 was prepared and processed into flat boards on aHatschek machine as described in Experiment Hl. The flat boards were subsequently corrugated in a conventional corrugation machine producing corrugated boards having a pitch i.e. wave length of 177 mm and a height i.e. distance from upper part of wave trough to upper part of wave crest of 51 mm plate thickness 6 mm . The boards were cured and autoclaved as described in Experiment Hl. Some boards were pressed for 45 80 min. at 100 kgf cmê before curing. Test coupons were cut from the autoclaved boards and two values of the modulus of rupture were measured for each coupon, namely MOR 1 with rupture parallel to the corrugations and MOR t with rupture perpendicular to the corrugations . The designations 1 , t , wet and stock are the same as stated above. The followihg test results were found Unpressed boards Density 1.04 g cm3 MOR 1 wet 7.6 MPa MOR t wet lO .7 MPa MOR i stock 12.1MPa MOR t stock 16.8 MPa. Pressed boards Density 1.34 g cm MOR 1 wet 12.6 MPa MOR t wetr 17.8 MPa MOR 1 stock 27.4MPa MOR t stock 29.4 MPa.The boards exhibited excellent frost resistance and water t ghtness.Example 9.Experiment on a full scale Magnani machine. An aqueous slurry having a water solid ratio equal to about 2 and containing 12 parts by weight cellulose fibres, 20 parts by weight ultra fine silica dust, 16 parts by weight fly ash and 52 parts by weight LSC cement was prepared as described in Example 8. The slurry was pumped into a Magnani machine where it was dewatered to corrugated boards pitch 147 mm, height 48 mm, thickness 6 7 mm . The unpressed boards were cured and autoclaved as described in Example 8. Test coupons were cut from the autoclaved boards and two values of the modulus of rupture were measured for each coupon, namely MOR 1 and MOR t.The designations 1 , t , wet and stock are as defined in Experiment 115. The following test results were found Density within the range 1.04 1.13 g cm MOR 1 wet within the range 7.5 12 MPa MOR t wet within the range 9 14 NPa NOR 1 stock within the range 13 20 NPa NOR t stock within the range 16 22 MPa.
