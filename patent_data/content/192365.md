## Description
This invention relates to an adhesive clad insulating substrate used for producing printed circuit boards by an additive process. Printed circuit boards are produced by an additive process, for example, by the following steps drilling of through holes on an insulating substrate coated with an adhesive containing an electroless plating catalyst chemical roughening of the surface of an adhesive layer formation of circuits by electroless plating or drilling of through holes on an insulating substrate coated with an adhesive containing an electroless plating catalyst chemical roughening of the surface of an adhesive layer electroless plating on the whole surface thereof formation of a resist on portions other than circuits to be formed electroplating removal of the resist removal of plating on portions other than the circuit portions by quick etching and the like. When a substrate containing no catalyst for electroless plating is used, it is immersed in a solution containing a catalyst for electroless plating in a suitable stage before the electroless plating. The adhesive in the printed circuit boards produced by the additive process should satisfy the fundamental requirements that it is susceptible to chemical roughening for tightly adhering a metal conductor circuit, that as a result, it is sufficient in bond strength, and that it has excellent heat resistance solder heat resistance enough to withstand soldering at a high temperature for loading electronic parts. The surface of a layer of the adhesive should be chemically roughened before the electroless plating. As an adhesive for this purpose, there have generally been proposed adhesives obtained by using as their main constituent a synthetic rubber which is susceptible to chemical roughening and flexible, for example, acrylonitrile butadiene rubber, crosslinking it by use of an alkylphenol resin in order to keep the heat resistance, and properly mixing therewith an epoxy resin or the like for instance, US A 3,625,758 . However, adhesives for printed circuit boards by additive process used in electronic machines which have been highly developed more and more in recent years have come to be required to be improved in heat resistance. For example, electronic parts loaded on a printed circuit board by soldering are often replaced because of troubles in the circuit. In such a case, rectification by manual soldering is conducted by using a soldering iron having a temperature usually as high as 300 C or higher, and in some cases, 400 to 420 C, and the adhesives in the places loaded with soldered parts is softened, so that a circuit is peeled off and tends to be cut. Therefore, replacement of the parts is very difficult. A reason for such insufficiency in heat resistance of the adhesive is as follows. The crosslinking between acrylonitrile butadiene rubber and phenolic resin is insufficient, and even when an epoxy resin is mixed, it does not react with the acrylonitrile butadiene rubber and they cure individually, so that the crosslinking of acrylonitrile butadiene rubber is not improved, resulting in insufficient heat resistance. US A 4 257 926 describes polycondensates of a phenol and formaldehyde or acetaldehyde produced using high levels of resorcinol to improve deliquescence, blocking and adhesion in materials to be used in adhering rubber to reinforcing materials in tyres, belts and hoses. This invention has been made in order to remove the conventional defects described above, and provides an adhesive clad insulating substrate for printed circuit boards produced by an additive process which is excellent in solder heat resistance and soldering iron heat resistance, etc. The invention provides an adhesive composition comprising This invention further provides an composition comprising insulating substrate having such an adhesive composition on at least one surface. The p substituted alkylphenol for producing the modified phenolic resin as the component A includes amylphenol, butylphenol, sec butylphenol and octylphenol. A reason why the amount of the phenol and or amine added is preferably 0.2 to 15 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the intermediate product is that when it is less than 0.2 part by weight, sufficient exhibition of the heat resistance of adhesive which is the object of this invention tends to be impossible, while when it exceeds 15 parts by weight, the miscibility with the acrylonitrile butadiene rubber used as an adhesive tends to be lowered. The acrylonitrile butadiene rubber is a copolymer of acrylonitrile and butadiene, or a copolymer obtained by copolymerizing therewith at least one of other copolymerizable monomers such as acrylic acid or the like. Although the acrylonitrile content is not critical, it is preferably 19 by weight or more when a commercially available one is used. In the adhesive composition, the compounding ratio of the aforesaid modified phenolic resin A to the acrylonitrile butadiene rubber B is preferably in the range of 70 30 to 7 93, more preferably 50 50 to 15 85 in solid weight ratio. As to the compounding ratio of the modified phenolic resin A to the acrylonitrile butadiene rubber B , when the proportion of the modified phenolic resin exceeds 70 by weight, no sufficient bond strength to electroless plating metal layer can be attained, while when it is less than 7 by weight, the heat resistance, in particular, soldering iron heat resistance is lowered. Although the adhesive composition fundamentally comprises the constituents described above, epoxy resins and the like are useful for improving nonstickiness and chemical resistance and can be properly used. In this invention, a catalyst for electroless plating which becomes a nucleus for electroless plating can be incorporated into the adhesive. As the catalyst for electroless plating, there can be used salts or oxides of metals in groups 8, 1B and 2B of the periodic table. For example, compounds of platinum, palladium, tin and the like are used. They can be incorporated into the adhesive in the form of solid particles, a solution of them alone in an organic solvent, or a solution prepared by dissolving and dispersing them together with other resins, for example, an epoxy resin in an organic solvent. The amount of the catalyst contained in the adhesive in terms of the above mentioned noble metal compounds ranges from 0.001 to 2.5 by weight, preferably 0.01 to 0.5 by weight based on the weight of solids in the adhesive. Inorganic fillers readily form unevenness of the surface in the step of chemical roughening and hence can improve the adhesive properties. They can be properly incorporated, and there can be used, for example, finely powdered silica, zirconium silicate, magnesium silicate, titanium dioxide, calcium carbonate, zinc oxide. The above mentioned components of the adhesive are kneaded and mixed in an organic solvent to prepare a mixture in the form of a solution. As the organic solvent, there can be used at least one member selected from the group consisting of toluene, methyl ethyl ketone, acetone, methyl isobutyl ketone, xylene, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate, ethyl acetate. As an insulating substrate, there can be used laminates obtained by using a phenolic resin or epoxy resin, or sheets made from inorganic or organic materials. The adhesive clad insulating substrate of this invention is produced by coating the above mentioned adhesive solution on such a substrate and drying the same by heating at a temperature of 120 to 190 C. As to the thickness of the adhesive coating film, the adhesive solution is coated to a thickness of 10 to 50 µm. In depositing an electroless plating metal layer, the surface of the adhesive film is chemically roughened to give a shape suitable for adhesion, and when a catalyst for electroless plating is contained, it is exposed on the surface by the chemical roughening. As a treating solution used for the chemical roughening, there can be used conventional chromic acid sulfuric acid, dichromate sulfuric acid. As an electroless plating bath, there can be used conventional one. Drilling for providing a printed circuit board with holes for loading electronic parts or through holes is conducted by means of a punch press or an NC drilling machine. Formation of a resist pattern is usually conducted by screen printing or photographic printing of a plating resist ink, and printing of the resist is conducted in a step before or after the chemical roughening treatment.
