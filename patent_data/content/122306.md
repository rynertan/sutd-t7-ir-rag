# Polyetherimide acrylate copolymer blends.

## Abstract
Disclosed are blends of a a polyetherimide and b a minor amount of an acrylate copolymer of C₁ C₅ acrylate and C₁ C₅ methacrylate. These blends have a higher impact strength than that associated with the polyetherimide com ponent of the blends. In addition, the blends exhibit improved extrusion and molding performance characteristics over those of the polyetherimide component of the blend when molded alone.
