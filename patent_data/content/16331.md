# Energy absorbing torque transmitter.

## Abstract
An energy absorbing torque transmitter comprising a hub member and rim member, one of which is connected to an output shaft, the other to an input shaft, the hub member having at least two hub rollers mounted thereon, the rim member of larger diameter having a plurality of rim rollers mounted thereon, said hub and rim members being opera tively connected by at least one belt of an oriented copolyetherester elastomer trained over hub and rim rollers, said belt capable of being stretched by up to about 60 of its original length upon application of force to either shaft to permit relative rotation of said hub member with respect to said rim member so that torque is transferred from one shaft to the other through said belt.
