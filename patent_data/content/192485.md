# Titanium dioxide particles, and process for preparing the same.

## Abstract
Spherical particles having sizes from 0.05 µm to 3.04 µm, and having a narrow size distribution, consist essentially of TiO₂ coated with a uniform layer having a thickness up to 400 Å consisting essentially of α or γ Fe₂O₃, magnetite or mixtures thereof. Such particles may be prepared by a process comprising precipitating the iron oxide from a Fe III salt solution on the surface of solid preformed TiO₂ particles, the Fe III concentration being less than or equal to 40 by weight calculated on the basis of TiO₂, the pH of the suspension being from 1.0 to 2.8, extremes excluded, and by heating the suspension to a temperature of from 80 to 100 C and by aging the suspension under such conditions during at least 30 minutes.
