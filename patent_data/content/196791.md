# Die for extruding ceramic honeycomb structure bodies.

## Abstract
A die 1 for extruding honeycomb structure bodies includes a plurality of ceramic batch material discharge grooves 4 and a plurality of ceramic batch material supply apertures 2 . Tubes 3 are fitted in at least one part of the ceramic batch material supply apertures 2 to improve or make constant the surface roughness and dimensions of inner surfaces of ceramic batch material supply apertures 2 through which the ceramic batch material passes, thereby producing perfect ceramic honeycomb structure bodies. The adjustment of flow of ceramic batch material is so simplified that any other controlling plate which would be required in the prior art is not needed for controlling the flow. When the supply apertures 2 have been worn off, the tubes 3 are exchanged by new ones to restore the required inner surfaces easily.
