## Description
FLUOROCHEMICAL POLYESTERS AND FIBROUS SUBSTRATES TREATED THEREWITH This invention relates to the treatment of fibrous substrates, such as textile fibers, paper, and leather, with fluorochemical compositions to impart oil and water repellency, and to the resulting treated substrates.In another aspect, it relates to the treatment of carpet fiber with a finish comprising a fluoroaliphatic radicalcontaining composition to impart oil and water repellency and soil resistance to such fiber. In another aspect, it relates to fluoroaliphatic radical containing compositions, and their preparation, which are useful in such treatment. In the industrial production of textiles, such as carpet and apparel, and such other fibrous substrates as paper and leather, it is common to treat such substrates with fluorochemicals containing fluoroaliphatic radicals often designated by the symbol Rf to impart oil and water repellency to the surface of such substrates. Fluorochemicals of this type and their application to fibrous substrates are described in various prior art publications, e.g., U.S.Patent Nos. 3,329,661 Smith et al , 3,458,571 Tokoli , 3,574,791 Sherman et al , 3,728,151 Sherman et al , 3,916,053 Sherman et al , 4,144,367 Landucci , 3,896,251 Landucci , 4,024,178 Landucci , 4,165,338 Katsushima et al , 4,190,545 Marshall , 4,215,205 Landucci , 4,013,627 Temple , 4,264,484 Patel , 4,250,300 Saegusa et al , 4,029,585 Dettre , 3,462,296 Raynolds et al , 4,219,625 Mares et al , 4,209,610 Mares et al , 3,671,493 Monaco et al , and 4,325,857 Champaneria et al , and Banks, R. E., Ed. Organofluorine Chemicals and their Industrial Applications , EllisHorwood, Ltd., West Sussex, England, 226 230 1979 . Although some fluorochemicals are useful in many applications and many are commercial products, some are relatively expensive to prepare and apply, others are difficult to apply, and others are not durable or do not impart the required properties to the extent desired. Conventionally, fluorochemical compositions have been commercially applied as a top coating to the finished fibrous article, such as carpet. Recently, several fluorochemical compositions have been commercially applied to textile fiber or yarn during its manufacture before it is woven or fabricated into the finished article. However, some of these fluorochemical compositions have had limited success for various reasons including incompatibility or reactivity of the fluorochemical with fiber finish components such as lubricants, lack of durability of the fluorochemical on the treated fiber to dyeing or other fiber manufacturing operations, and insufficient water and oil repellency and soil resistance in the finished article. It is an object of this invention to provide fluoroaliphatic radical containing compounds with aliphatic polysLer seynlents hereinaEter of ten called tluorocllestlical polyesters for brevity useful for treating textile fibers and other fibrous substrates to impart oil and water repellency thereto. Another object of this invention is to provide fluorochemical polyesters which can be used to treat textile fibers in combination with or as a component of fiber finishes, e.g. spin finish lubricants, such polyesters being compatible with said fiber finishes and not interfering with normal textile fiber processing steps. A further object of this invention is to provide fluorochemical treated textile fiber with a high percentage of the fluorochemical retained on the fiber through Eiber processing and dyeing steps, and with durable water and oil repellency and soil resistance properties. It is yet another object of this invention to provide fluorochemical polyesters which can be used in the form of organic solutions or aqueous dispersions to treat fibrous substrates such as textile fibers, filaments, yarns, or finished fibrous articles, e.g. carpets, and other fibrous substrates such as paper and leather, to impart oil and water repellency thereto. Briefly, this invention provides, in one aspect, compositions comprising or consisting essentially of normally solid, water insoluble, fluorochemical compounds which have one or more monovalent fluoroaliphatic radicals Rf and one or more aliphatic polyester segments Z an oligomeric moiety made of a plurality of ester units, e.g., CH2 5COO n, the chain oxygen of one ester unit in the segment being bonded to a terminal carbon atom of another adjacent ester unit in the segment , said radicals bonded by linking groups Q to terminal atoms of said segments.Said fluorochemical polyesters are novel per se and are useful in the form of organic solutions or aqueous dispersions in the treatment of fibrous substrates, such as textile fibers or filaments during their manufacture, and useful also in the treatment of finished or fabricated fibrous substrates such as carpets, paper, and leather, to impart oil and water repellency to the surface thereof. A class of said fluorochemical polyesters can be represented by the general formula Rf a QZ bY I where Rf is a fluoroaliphatic radical, Q is a linking group, Z is said aliphatic polyester segment, viz., a divalent oligomeric moiety made up of a plurality of aliphatic ester units, each such unit having the structure O R CO derived, for example, from hydroxycarboxylic acids by self esterification or from lactones by ring opening polymerization and or O R O CO R CO derived, for example, from the condensation of diols with dicarboxylic acids , where R,R , and R are the same or different aliphatic moieties, e.g. alkylene with 2 to 20 carbon atoms, Y is Q R1 or Q Z Q Rl C where c is 1 or 2, R1 is H, Rf, or terminal monovalent organic radicals such as alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, or combinations thereof, e.g. aralkyl, which radicals can contain hetero moieties, e.g. O , S , N , Si , and CO , and is preferably free of active or isocyanate reactive hydrogen atoms i.e., hydrogen atoms of groups, such as mercapto, amino, carboxyl, and aliphatic hydroxyl groups, that can react readily with isocyanate under urethane bond forming conditions, e.g., 20 to 1000C , a is an integer of 1 to 3, and b is an integer of 1 to 3. The fluoroaliphatic radical, Rf, is a fluorinated, stable, inert, non polar, preferably saturated, monovalent moiety which is both oleophobic and hydrophobic.It can be straight chain, branched chain, and, if sufficiently large, cyclic, or combinations thereof, such asEluoroalkylcycloaliphatic radicals. The skeletal chain can include catenary oxygen, hexavalent sulfur, and or trivalent nitrogen hetero atoms bonded only to carbon atoms, such hetero atoms providing stable linkages between fluorocarbon portions of Rf and not interferring with the inert character of the Rf radical. While Rf can have a large number of carbon atoms, compounds where Rf is not more than 20 carbon atoms will be adequate and preferred since large radicals usually represent a less efficient utilization of fluorine than is possible with smaller Rf radicals. The large radicals also are generally less soluble in organic solvents. Generally, Rf will have 3 to 20 carbon atoms, preferably 6 to about 12, and will contain 40 to 78 weight percent, preferably 50 to 78 weight percent, fluorine. The terminal portion of the Rf group has at least three fully fluorinated carbon atoms, e.g.CF3CF2CF2 , and the preferred compounds are those in which the Rf group is fully or substantially completely fluorinated, as in the case where Rf is perfluoroalkyl, CnF2n l Commercially available Rf containing products generally are mixtures of such compounds with the number of carbon atoms in the Rf moieties of the compounds varying, and in the formulas herein for such compounds the recited number of carbon atoms in the fluoroaliphatic radical unless indicated otherwise is an average of the fluoroaliphatic carbon atoms in the mixture. In this application the given number of carbon atoms in the Rf moieties of the fluorochemical polyesters and other fluorochemicals should likewise be understood to be an average number unless indicated otherwise. The function of the linking group Q is to bond the R1 or Rf group to the polyester segment Z through a terminal atom thereof, e.g. an oxygen atom, or to link a plurality of such segments. Q can comprise a hetero atom containing group or an organic group or a combination of such groups, examples of which are polyvalent aliphatic, e.g., CH2 , CH2CH2 , and CH2,CH CH2 2, polyvalent aromatic, oxy, thio, carbonyl, sulfone, sulfoxy, N CH3 , sulfonamido, carbonamido, sulfonamidoalkylene, carbonamidoalkylene, carbonyloxy, urethane, e.g., CH2CH2OCONH , and urea, e.g., NHCONH . The linkage Q for a specific fluorochemical polyester useful in this invention will be dictated by the ease of preparation of such a compound and the availability of necessary precursors thereof.From the above description of O, it is apparent that this linkage can have a wide variety of structures and in the fluorochemical polyesters made from a mixture of precursors there will be a corresponding mixture of, or different, Q s. Subclasses of general formula I are those represented by the formulas Rl Q otR2ooC R3CootnR2 O Q Rl II Rl Q ofOCR3 COOR2 O nOCR3COO Q Rl III where R1 and Q are as defined for formula I, with the proviso that at least one R1 is said Rf, R2 is an aliphatic moiety, preferably a residue of an aliphatic diol, e.g., ethylene glycol, 1,4 butene diol, and cyclohexanediol, and has 2 to 20, preferably 2 to 8, carbon atoms, R3 is an aliphatic moiety, preferably a residue of an aliphatic dicarboxylic acid, e.g., adipic acid, maleic acid, and cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid, and has 2 to 20, preferably 4 to 8, carbon atoms, and n is an integer of 1 to 20, preferably 1 to 10.R2 and R3 may contain hetero atoms, e.g., 0 , and substituents which do not interfere with the function of the polyester. The fluorochemical polyesters of formulas II andIII may be prepared by a variety of synthetic procedures.For example, a preformed hydroxyl or carboxyl terminated polyester can be obtained commercially or prepared by known reactions of dicarboxylic acids, esters, anhydrides or acid chlorides with aliphatic diols, the mole ratios being dusted to obtain the desired hydroxy or carboxyl end groups. Suitable polyester polyols which can be used to prepare the fluorochemical polyester are described, for example, in Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Technology,Interscience Pub., 11 1969 , p. 513. The functionally terminated polyesters can then be reacted with the desired fluorochemical reagent precursor, e.g., fluorochemical alcohol, acid, isocyanate, amines, etc., to form the fluorochemical polyesters of this invention. Alternatively the fluorochemical reagent, e.g., a fluorochemical acid, can be coreacted with the polyester precursor reayents, e.g., aliphatic dicarboxylic acid and aliphatic diol, under esterification conditions to yield the desired fluorochemical polyester. Representative reaction schemes for the preparation of fluorochemical polyesters of formulas II and III are outlined below. Scheme 1EMI7.1 Scheme 2EMI7.2 A scheme for the preparation of fluorochemical polyesters of formula II, where R1 Q is derived from an isocyanate compound, is outlined below. Scheme 3EMI7.3 where X is O, S, or where Q isNR, where R1 is Rf, Q X CONH A H or alkyl, at least one R1 being RE EMI7.4 see Scheme 1 for preparation RÚ Q NHCOO Rê OOC R COO nRê OOCNH Q RÚ Suitable diisocyanate precursors may be simple, e.g. tolylene 2,4 diisocyanate, methylene bis 4 phenyleneisocyanate , and mixtures thereof, or complex, as formed by the reaction of a simple diisocyanate with an organic diol or polyol in appropriate proportions to yield an isocyanate terminated polyurethane. Other isocyanates can also be used as starting materials. Some of these are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,174,433.Representative A groups include CH2C6H4CH2C6H4CH2 r C63 CH3 , C6H10CH2C6H10 , CB2 6 , C6H4CH2C6H4 , and C8F17SO2N C2H4OCoNHC6H3 CH3 2. Although the fluorochemical polyesters used in this invention generally and preferably are derived from diisocyanates, the fluorochemical polyesters can be derived from triisocyanates, e.g. OCNC6H4CH2C6H3 NCO CH2C6H4NCO. A mixture of di and tri isocyanates can be used to provide fluorochemical polyesters which are branched but still retain the desired solubility and dispersibility characteristics of the linear f luorochemical polyesters. Another sybclass of general formula I is that represented by the formula RÚ Q X dR4 X COR5 OOCR5 mO Q RÚ e IV where R4 is an organic moiety, preferably a residue of a polyol or polyamine used as a lactone polymeriza tion initiator, X is O or N R , where R is H or alkyl e.g. with 1 4 carbon atoms , R5 is an alkylene moiety, preferably having 4 to 11 catenary carbon atoms, R1 and Q are as defined for formula I with the proviso that at least one Pal is said Rf, d is 1 or zero, e is 1, 2, or 3, with the proviso that the sum of d e is 2 to 3, preferably 3, and m is an integer or number of 1 to 20, with the proviso that if m is 1, then X must be O . When subscript d in formula IV is zero, the resulting fluorochemical polyesters can be represented by the formula R4 X COR5 OOCR5 nO Q RÚ p V where R4, X , R5, R1, and Q are as defined in formula IV, n is an integer or number of 2 to 20, preferably 3 to 10, though where X is O , n can also be 1 to 2, and p is an integer of 1 to 3. Some of the polyester precursors, e.g., R4 OoCR5 noH p, where p is 1, 2, or 3, of the fluorochemical polyesters of formula V, are available commercially, e.g., NIAX polylactone polyols seeBulletin U 10, p. 9, copyright 1969, 1970, of Union CarbideCorp. , derived from caprolactone. Other related polyester precursors may be prepared by polymerization of other lactones utilizing active hydrogen containing initiators, e.g., alcohols, amines, acids, etc., by ring opening polymerization, as described, for example, in U.S. PatentNo. 3,169,945 Hostettler et al . Suitable lactones include laurolactone, pivalolactone, etc. A representative reaction scheme for the prepara tion of fluorochemical polyesters of formula V is outlined below Scheme 4 .

The amounts of by products depend on the mode of addition, molar ratio of reactants, and the relative reactivity of isocyanate functional groups. Generally there will not be any need to remove such by products in the use of the fluorochemical polyester products in the treatment of fibrous substrates to impart oil and water repellency thereto. The fluorochemical polyesters preferably have at least one major transition temperature yreater than 25 C, more preferably greater than that about 40 C, and most preferably greater than about 450C. If desired, the fluoro chemical polyester compositions of the invention can and generally will contain mixtures of such polyesters with the number of ester units in the polyester segments varying, and in the formulas for such polyesters the given number of those ester units are average numbers unless otherwise indicated.

Representative functionally terminated polyesters useful in the preparation of the fluorochemical polyesters include HO CH2 5COO 3C2H4 OOC CH2 5 4OH H O CH2 5CO 5NHC2H4NH OC CH2 5O 6H HO CH2 4O OC CH2 4COO CH2 4O 6HEMI13.1 HSCH2COO CH2 11COO 4C6H4 OOC CH2 11 3OOCH2SH HOOC CH2 8COOC2H4OOC CH2 8COOH C8H17 OOC CH2 53 50H and mixtures thereof. Representative alcohols, thiols and amines useful, for example in Scheme 3, in the preparation of the fluorochemical polyesters include C2H50H ClC2H4OH C4HgOH C6H5CH20H N CH2CH2OH 3 C12H25OH C8H17SH C12H25SHC2HSNH2 C6H13NH2 C4H9 2NHC6H5N CH3 HEMI14.1 C4H9N CH2CH2CN H HOCH2CH2NH2 and mixtures thereof. Representative lactones and hydroxy acids useful in the preparation of the fluorochemical polyesters include caprolactone methyl caprolactone laurolactone valerolactone butyrolactone prop iolactone glycolic acid l0 hydroxydecanoic acid dilne thylolp roL ionic acid and mixtures thereof. Generally, the fluorochemical polyesters will contain about 10 to 70 weight percent, preferably about 20 to 40 weight percent, of carbon bonded fluorine. If the fluorine content is less than about 20 weight percent, impractically large amounts of the fluorochemical polyesters will generally be required, while fluorine contents greater than about 70 weight percent are unnecessary to achieve the desired surface properties and thus represent an uneconomical use of fluorine and may also present compatibility problems where it is desired to apply the fluorochemical blend as an organic solution. The fluorochemical polyesters of this invention are used per se in imparting oil and water repellency to fibrous substrates. However, they can also be used in conjunction with other fluorochemicals also known to be useful for that purpose. In particular, the fluorochemical polyesters can be used in admixture with fluoroaliphatic radical containing poly oxyalkylene polymers or oligomers . Generally, the oxyalkylene polymers will contain about 5 to 40 weight percent, preferably about 10 to 30 weight percent, of carbon bonded fluorine. The oxyalkylene group can have 2 to 4 carbon atoms, such as OCH2CH2 , OCH2CH2CH2 , OCH CH3 CH2 , and OCH CH3 CH CH3 , The molecular weight of the poly oxyalkylene radical can be as low as 220 but preferably is about 500 to 2500 and higher, e.g. 100,000 to 200,000 or higher. The polyacrylates are a particularly useful class of poly oxyalkylenes and they can be prepared, for example, by free radical initiated copolymerization of a fluoroaliphatic radical containing acrylate with a poly oxyaltylene acrylate, e.g., monoacrylate or diacrylate or mixtures thereof. As an example, a fluoroaliphatic acrylate, Rf R6 02C CH CH2 where R6 is, for example, sulfonamidoalkylene, carbonamidoalkylene, or alkylene , e.g., C8F17SO2N C4Hg CH2CH202CCH CH2, can be copolymerized with a poly oxyalkylene monoacrylate, CH2 CHC O OC2H4 nOCH3, to produce a polyacrylate oxyalkylenes. Further description of z 1 fluorochemicsl oxyalkylenes useful in this invention will be omitted in the interest of brevity since such compounds and their preparation are known, said U.S. Patent No. 3,787,351 and U.S. Patent No. 4,289,892, both of which are incorporated he rein for that purpose. The amounts of fluorochemical polyester, compo nent a , and fluorochemical oxyalkylene, component b , in a blend thereof can vary over a broad range, and will be selected to provide the desired balance of properties on the treated fiber of the finished article. Generally, component a will be the major amount of the blend and component b will be the minor amount. The particular amount depends on the particular composition of the textile fiber or article to be treated and the particular chemical composition of a and b , as well as the application procedures used. Laboratory evaluation will often be a good indicator of appropriate relative amounts of components a and b to be used for obtainig the desired performance in commercial application. Generally, the relative amounts of components a and b fall within the following ranges Weight percent of fluorochemical solids in blend Component Broad Range Preferred Range a 60 99 70 95 b 1 40 5 30 The fluorochemical polyesters of this invention or blends thereof with other fluorochemicals, e.g. said fluorochemical poly oxyalkylenes can be utilized in neat form or as an organic solvent solution or as an aqueous dispersion or emulsion. If an aqueous dispersion is the desired form, the emulsification may be performed on the above organic solvent containing fluorochemical polyester, or, where a blend of the fluorochemicals is desired, individually emulsified fluorochemical components may be blended by simple mixing techniques as either solventcontaining or solvent free emulsions.In the preparation of said emulsions it may be beneficial to employ cationic fluorochemical surfactants e.g., C8F17SO2N H C3H6N CH3 3Cl along with hydrocarbon non ionic surfactants e.g., Tween 80 polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate . Substrates which can be treated in accordance with this invention are textile fibers or filaments , and finished or fabricated fibrous articles such as textiles, e.g. carpet, paper, paperboard, leather, and the like. The textiles include those made from natural fibers, such as cotton and wool, and those made from synthetic organic fibers, such as nylon, polyolef in, acetate, rayon, acrylic, and polyester fibers. Especially good results are obtained on nylon and polyester fibers. The fibers or filaments as such or in an aggregated form, e.g. yarn, tow, web, or roving, or the fabricated textile, e.g., articles such as carpet and woven fabrics, can be treated with the fluorochemical polyester compositions.The treatment can be carried out by applying the fluorochemical polyester compositions as organic solutions or aqueous or organic dispersions by known techniques customarily used in applying fluorochemicals, e.g. fluorochemical acrylate copolymers, to fibers and fibrous substrates. For example, the fluorochemical treatment can be by immersing the fibrous substrates in a bath containing the fluorochemical polyester composition, padding the substrate or spraying the same with the fluorochemical composition, or by foam, kiss roll, or metering applications, e.g. spin finishing, and then drying the treated substrates if solvent is present. If desired, the fluorochemical polyester composition can be co applied with conventional fiber treating agents or adjuvants , e.g. antistatic agents or neat oils non aqueous fiber lubricants . In the manufacture of synthetic organic fibers see, for example, the review article in Encyclopedia ofPolymer Science and Technology, Interscience Publishers, 8, 1968, 374 404 , the first step that normally takes place in the process, following initial formation of the filaments e.g. by melt spinning or solvent spinning , is coating the fiber surface with a small amount generally less than 2 active solids on fiber of fiber finish comprising lubricating and antistatic agents. It is particularly advantageous to treat such textile fibers, e.g. nylon 6, with the fluorochemical polyester composition of this invention in conjunction with the spin finish being applied to such textile fibers. Fiber finishes are generally produced in the form of dilute aqueous emulsions or as an oil which principally contains said lubricant and antistatic agent as well as emulsifier surfactant and may also contain materials such as bacteriocides and antioxidants. Representative lubricants include mineral oils, waxes, vegetable oils triglycerides such as coconut oil, peanut oil, and castor oil, synthetic oils, such as esters, polyoxyethylene derivatives of alcohols and acids, and silicone oils. The antistatic agents, emulsifiers, and sur reactants incorporated into the fiber finish are selected from similar chemical classes, which include a anionics, such as fatty acid soaps, sulfated vegetable oils, salts of alkyl and ethoxylated alkyl phosphates b cationics, such as fatty amines, quaternary ammonium compounds, and quaternary phosphonium compounds c nonionics, such as glyceryl monooleate, ethoxylated alcohols, ethoxylated fatty acids, and ethoxylated fatty amides and d amphoterics, such as betaines, amino acids and their salts. A description of fiber finishes to which the fluorochemical polyester compositions of this invention can be added is found in Encyclopedia of Polymer Science andTechnology, Interscience Pub., 10 1969 , p. 427 to 429. The preferred mode of applying the fluorochemical polyester composition of this invention to synthetic organic fibers is to incorporate the polyester composition into the above described fiber finishes in an amount sufficient to achieve the desired properties of oil and water repellency. Generally, the amount of fluorochemical polyester to be used will be that sufficient to retain on the fiber of the finished article, e.g., carpet, about 200 to 1600 ppm fluorine based on the weight of the fiber.Such additions to the conventional fiber finish can be carried out without sacrificing or adversely affecting typical requirements that conventional fiber finishes must meet, namely lubrication, thermal stability, low fuming at elevated temperature, and wetting for fiber dyeability color addition . The conventional finish components of the fiber finishes containing the fluorochemical polyester compositions of this invention can be removed in a conventional manner after the fiber is manufactured in fabric form, e.g., carpets and upholstery fabrics.The fluorochemical polyester compositions withstand the typical conditions encountered during fiber and yarn processing and also survive the more severe processing conditions which the greige goods encounter such as scouring and dyeing, and the finished goods encounter, such as washing, steam cleaning, and dry cleaning. The fluorochemical polyester compositions do not interfere with, and are durable through, the normal fiber processing steps, e.g., drawing, texturizing, and heat setting, and provide oil and water repellency properties to the finished article, e.g., carpet made from the treated fibers. The conventional application methods used to apply finishes to fibers or filaments can be used with the fluorochemical polyester finishes of this invention. Such methods include the use of either a a revolving ceramic cylinder, i.e., kiss roll, which is partially immersed in a pan containing the finish, over which the moving filaments pass and pick up a thin film of finish, b a metering pump supplying finish through a slot or hole in a fiber guide over which the moving filaments pass, c an immersion finish bath, or d spraying devices. The fluorochemical polyester compositions of this invention are generally compatible with i.e., dispersible or sufficiently soluble in commercial neat oil fiber finishes, yielding stable dispersions or solutions thereof, and thus the fluorochemical polyesters may be mixed with such finishes and coapplied or applied before or after them . Solubilizing aids, such as Carbitol or Cellosolvc solvents, can be added to the finish to enhance solubility of the fluorochemical blends in the neat oil finish. Fluorochemical polyesters used in the following examples are species of general formula VII and have the structures shown in Table 1, or are species of general formula VIII and have the structures shown in Table 2.

Weight ratios of fluorochemical acrylate monomers Table 4 and fluorochemical poly oxyalkylene monomers Table 5 can vary but should be chosen along with said optional comonomers so that the carbon bonded fluorine content of the resulting copolymer is in the desired range of 5 to 40 weight percent. Objects and advantages of this invention are illustrated in the following examples. Example 1 In a 2 liter, 3 neck flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, condenser, thermometer, and electric heating mantle were placed 232 g 1.3 moles 2,4 tolylenediisocyanate, 508 g butoxyethoxyethyl acetate solvent, 553 g 0.65 mole of a 830 molecular weight polycaprolactone diol NIAX Polyol D 520 , and 739 g 1.3 moles N ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamidoethyl alcohol.The reaction mixture was stirred and heated for 2 hours at 65 850C, then 1.4 g dibutyltindilaurate urethane catalyst was added, and heating and stirring continued for an additional 2 hours. Infrared absorption analysis of a small portion of the reaction mixture indicated completion of the reaction shown by absence of unreacted NCO groups to yield the fluorochemical urethane polyester adduct product, the major component of which had the structure designated number 1 in Table 1. Example 2 In a 250 ml, 3 neck flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, a condenser adapted with a calibrated receiver for azeotroped water , and electric heating mantle, were placed 40.4 g 0.2 mole sebacic acid, 21.3 g 0.15 mole , l,4 bis hydroxymethyl cyclohexane, 54 g 0.10 mole N methyl perfluorooctane sulfoamidoethyl alcohol, 40 g toluene solvent, and, as esterifying catalysts, 0.05 g o toluenesulfonic acid and 6 drops of concentrated sulfuric acid. The reaction mixture was stirred and heated at 80 to 1000C for 0.5 hour, then stirred and heated to reflux at 106 to 1250C pot temperature for 15 hours while removing water 6.5 ml, plus some droplets on the condenser walls, theoretical being 7.2 ml formed during the esterification reaction as an azeotrope with toluene.Most of the remaining toluene was removed by evaporation, while warming, to yield 118 g of a fluorochemical polyester product whose major component was that numbered 2 in Table 1. Example 3 Following the procedure of Example 2, except that ethylene glycol 0.05 mole was used as the diol, and 0.1 mole was used for each of the fluoroalcohol and sebacic acid reactants, a fluorochemical polyester product was prepared, the major component of which had the structure denoted as number 3 in Table 1. Example 4 In a 500 ml, 3 neck flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, condenser, thermometer, and electric heating mantle, was placed 100 g 0.4 mole methylenebis 4 phenyleneisocyanate , 53 g NIAX PCP D 0200 diol 0.1 mole , 55.4 g 0.1 mole N ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamidoeti alcohol, and 150 g methyl ethyl ketone MEK for 3 hours. To the stirred solution, containing fluorochemical urethane isocyanate product and unreacted diisocyanate, was added 3.0 g camphene phenyl phosphine oxide, CloHl6POC6H5, a carbodiimide forming catalyst, and the reaction mixture was stirred and heated at about 800C for about 8 hours, at which time essentially all of the remaining isocyanate groups had been converted to carbodiimide groups as indicated by infrared absorption analysis. The resulting fluorochemical polyester product had as its major component the structure numbered 8 inTable 1, Examples 5 8 Following the procedure of Example 1, the reagents in Table 7 were used to prepare various fluorochemical polyester products as described in Table 8.

Example 9 Using the apparatus of Example 1, 330 g 1.5 moles isophorone diisocyanate, 215 g butoxyethoxyethyl acetate solvent, 270 g 0.5 mole of a 540 molecular weight polycaprolactone triol NIAX Polyol PCP 0300 , and 554 g 1.0 mole N ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamidoethyl alcohol were placed in the reaction flask. The reaction mixture was stirred and heated to 400C for about 15 minutes, the heat turned off, and 65 g 0.5 mole dibutylamine added over a 15 minute period. After a mild exotherm, the reaction mixture was stirred and heated at 65 950C for 3 hours, 1.2 g dibutyltindilaurate urethane catalyst added, and heating and stirring continued at 90 1050C for an additional 1.5 hours.Infrared absorption analysis indicated completion of the reaction to yield a fluorochemical urethane urea polyester adduct product, the major component of which had the structure designated number 9 in Table 2. Example 10 Following the procedure of Example 9, except that the diisocyanate used was p xylylenediisocyanate and ethyl acetate was used as solvent, a fluorochemical urethane urea polyester product was prepared, the major component of which had the structure 10 in Table 2. Example 11 Following the procedure of Example 9, except that 0.75 mole of the fluorochemical alcohol was used, and the diisocyanate used was methylenediphenyl 4,4 diisocyanate and 0.75 mole of dibutylamine were employed, and the solvent used was ethyl acetate, a fluorochemical urethane urea polyester product was prepared, the major component of which had the structure 11 in Table 2. In the following examples, the fluorochemical polyesters described in Examples 1 11 were used to treat various textile substrates, and the treated articles evaluated for effectiveness of the fluorochemical treatment. Examples 12 34 In these examples, undyed, level loop, nylon 6 carpet was treated in a padding operation 909Ó wet pickup with an acetone solution of fluorochemical polyester, including in some cases a minor amount of a fluorochemical poly oxyalkylene . In some cases the acetone solution also contained 1 to 1.5 of a coconut oil or mineral oil paraff in based spin finish. The total concentration of the two fluorochemicals was in the range of 0.2 to 0.5 solids in order to deposit on the carpet fibers an amount of fluorochemical equivalent to about 700 ppm. fluorine. The treated carpet was dried for 10 minutes at 500C and then heated at 1500C for 5 min., acid dyed, rinsed, dried 700C, 30 min. , and heated 1300C, 10 min. . For purpose of comparison, control examples C l to C 7 were run in which either a carpet treatment was employed using as fluorochemical a fluorochemical polyether or a fluorochemical urethane, or the example C 7 did not include any treatment. The oil repellency OR , water repellency WR and walk on soil resistance WOS were determined on the treated samples. The data are summarized in Table 9. The water repellency test is one which is often used for this purpose. The aqueous stain or water repellency of treated samples is measured using a 7ater isopropyl alcohol test, and is expressed in terms ofa water repellency rating of the treated carpet or fabric.Treated carpets which are penetrated by or resistant only to a 100 percent water 0 percent isopropyl alcohol mixture the least penetrating of the test mixtures are given a rating of 100 0, whereas treated fabrics resistant to a 0 percent water 100 percent isopropyl alcohol mixture the most penetrating of the test mixtures are given a rating of 0 100. Other intermediate values are determined by use of other water isopropyl alcohol mixtures, in which the percentage amounts of water and isopropyl alcohol are each multiples of 10. The water repellency rating corresponds to the most penetrating mixture which does not penetrate or wet the fabric after 10 seconds contact. In general a water repellency rating of 90 10 or better, e.g, 80 20, is desirable for carpet. The oil repellency test is also one which is often used for this purpose. The oil repellency of treated carpet and textile samples is measured by AATCC StandardTest 118 1978, which test is based on the resistance of treated fabric to penetration by oils of varying surface tensions. Treated fabrics resistant only to Nujol , a brand of mineral oil and the least penetrating of the test oils, are given a rating of 1, whereas treated fabrics resistant to heptane the most penetrating of the test oils are given a value of 8. Other intermediate values are determined by use of other pure oils or mixtures of oils. The rated oil repellency corresponds to the most penetrating oil or mixture of oils which does not penetrate or wet the fabric after 10 seconds contact rather than the 30 seconds contact of the Standard Test.Higher numbers indicate better oil repellency. In general, an oil repellency of 2 or greater is desirable for carpet. The soil resistance of treated and untreated carpet was determined by exposure to pedestrian traffic according to AATCC Test method 122 1979, the exposure site being a heavily travelled industrial area for an exposure of about 15,000 traffics . The samples are repositioned periodically to insure uniform exposure and are vacuumed every 24 hours during the test and before visual evaluation.The evaluation employed the following Walk On Soiling WOS rating system where the control referred to is C 7 of Table 9 WOS Rating Description 0 equal to control 1 2 slightly better or worse than control 1 impressive difference compared to control 1 1 2 very impressive difference compared to control 2 extremely impressive difference compared to control Table 9 Relative amts. of Amt. of fluorine on carpetFluorochemical used fluoro Spin Before After RetentionEx.Poly chemicals finish dyeing, dyeing, on fiber,No. ester a Ú. other b ê. a b used4. ppm ppm OR WR WOS 12 1 None 100 0 SF 1 620 440 71 5 70 30 1 2 to 1 13 1 b 1 90 10 None 605 505 84 4 70 30 1 2 14 1 b 1 90 10 SF 1 460 435 94 3 70 30 1 2 to 1 15 1 b 1 90 10 SF 1 570 470 82 5 70 30 1 16 1 b 1 80 20 SF 1 680 390 57 5 70 30 1 2 17 1 b 2 80 20 SF 1 880 535 86 5 70 30 0 18 1 b 2 90 10 SF 1 615 370 60 4 80 20 1 2 19 2 None 100 0 None 565 405 72 5 60 40 1 2 to 1 20 2 None 100 0 SF 1 480 310 65 4 70 30 1 2 21 3 None 100 0 None 600 495 83 3 60 40 0 22 3 None 100 0 SF 1 415 345 83 5 80 20 0 to 1 2 23 4 None 100 0 SF 1 680 475 70 4 50 50 1 2 24 4 None 100 0 SF 1 665 360 55 5 40 60 0 25 5 None 100 0 SF 1 670 450 67 5 70 30 0 26 1 None 100 0 SF 1 585 300 51 4 70 30 0 27 6 None 100 0 None 580 555 96 5 70 30 2 28 6 None 100 0 SF 1 530 445 84 5 70 30 1 2 to 1 1 2 Table 9 continued Relative amts. of Amt. of fluorine on carpetFluorochemical used fluoro Spin Before After RetentionEx.

SP 1 was a paraffin mineral oil based spin finish applied in amount to deposit 1 wt. of the spin finish, and SF 2 was a coconut oil based spin finish applied in an amount to deposit 1 1 2 wt. of the spin finish.5. NWR means no water resistance. The data of Table 9 show that useful oil and water repellency results are obtained by using the fluorochemical polyesters of this invention, per se or in a blend with fluorochemical poly oxyalkylenes . As far as soil resistance is concerned, the WOS results in most of the examples using those polyesters or blends were better than the WOS results of untreated carpet Ex. C 7 . The data also show that the use of fluorochemical poly oxyalkylene blended with the fluorochemical polyester generally improves fluorine retention through dyeing, although too much, i.e., 20 , of the poly oxyalkylene component detracts from high fluorine retention. The data also show that the use of a paraffin based finish gives generally better soil resistance than a coconut oil based spin f inish. Examples 35 38 In each of these examples, two different rainwear fabrics were treated with fluorochemical polyester in a padding operation, dried at 1500C for 10 minutes, and evaluated for initial oil repellency OR and resistance to a water spray SR , then these properties evaluated again after 5 launderings 5L and also after one dry cleaning DC . The OR test used was the above described AATCCStandard Test 118 1978, the contact time before observation being the specified 30 sec., an OR value of 3 or greater being particularly desirable for rainwear fabrics. The water spray rating SR is measured by AATCC Test Method 22 1979. The spray rating is measured using a 0 to 100 scale where 100 is the highest possible rating. In general, a spray rating of 70 or greater is desirable, articularly for outerwear fabrics. The treated fabrics were laundered using a mechanically agitated automatic washing machine capable of containing a 4 Kg. load, using water at 500C and a commercial detergent, and then the washed fabrics were tumble dried in an automatic dryer for 40 minutes at 700C and pressed in a flat bed press at 1540C before testing. The treated fabrics were dry cleaned using perchloroethylene containing 1 of a dry cleaning detergent and tumbling in a motor driven tumble jar AATCC TestMethod 70 1975 for 20 minutes at 25 C. After removing excess solvent in a wringer, samples were dried at 700C for 10 minutes, then pressed on each side for 15 seconds on a flat bed press maintained at 154 C. The data are summarized in Table 10 together with comparison examples C 7 through C 10. Table 10 Oil and water repellency Type of After 5Ex. Fluorochemical fabric Initial launderingsNo. used usedd.

Example 39 A neat oil spin finish consisting of 14.3 fluorochemical polyester of formula 1 of Table 1, 2.5 fluorochemical poly oxyalkylene numbered 1 in Table 6, 48.2 of a coconut oil based fiber lubricant composition, and 35 butoxyethoxyethanol was applied by a metered slot applicator to freshly melt extruded, undrawn carpet denier yarn of nylon 6 fibers. The thus treated yarn was continuously drawn and texturized, plied to form a two ply yarn, heat set at 1900C for one minute, and then made into cut pile carpet 28 oz yd2 . The carpet was acid dyed by three different processes, dried, and then evaluated for oil and water repellency, walk on soil resistance, and retention of fluorochemical treatment as measured by fluorine analysis through the dyeing process.
