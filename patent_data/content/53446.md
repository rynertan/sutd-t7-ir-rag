# IMPROVED APPARATUS FOR REMOTELY DETERMINING THE POSITION OF ROTATING OBJECTS

## Abstract
An electric field is generated in the vicinity of a rotating member to be monitored. The electric field is so constructed as to include a resultant vector repre senting maximum field strength rotating in a path par allel to the circumferential path of the rotating member. A sensing or reading device is positioned at the rota tional axis of the resultant vector for detecting varia tions in the field strength therein as the vector passes the rotating member. The sensing device creates a periodic electrical output whose relative phase is re sponsive to and indicative of the angular orientation of the rotating member. The electric field with the rotating resultant vector is formed by generating a polyphase voltage having a plurality of signals, each signal separat ed from the others by a prescribed phase angle, and wherein each signal is shaped as a square wave. Each of the signals is applied to one of a plurality of exciting electrodes which are arranged in a circular array around a center point aligned with the axis of rotation of the resultant vector. Successive electrodes in the arran gement are connected to successive signals of the poly phase voltage.
