# A hermetic seal.

## Abstract
A hermetic seal between opposing surfaces 14, 22 of a two part housing containing a highly permoable fluid such as helium comprises a spring metal C ring 13 hav ing a ductile metal coating 28 on at least the surface portions thereof which in contact with the opposing hous ing surfaces 14, 22 , and an organic material coating 30 applied at least to the surface portions of the ductile metal which contact the same housing surfaces. Presure is applied to the coated C ring by the opposing housing surfaces 14, 22 causing the organic material to fill any microvoids or scratches in the surfaces, and causing the ductile metal to fill the larger voids and discrepancies, thereby forming an impermeable leakable barrier for the highly permeable fluid contained within the housing.
