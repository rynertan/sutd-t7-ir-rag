# Method of manufacture of an electrical multi contact connector.

## Abstract
An electrical connector is formed from a lamina 1, 10 of elastomeric material having conductive tracks 2, 15 on one surface by folding the lamina and bonding opposed lamina portions together. The conductive tracks extend around the fold between contact portions 6 on opposite surfaces of the connector. Suitably the lamina is of thermoplastic material so that bonding is by fusion and the conductive tracks 15 may be flush with the connector surfaces. The connector is formed in a U shaped nest 11 under pressure and the lamina 10 is formed about a core 12 of elastomeric material.
