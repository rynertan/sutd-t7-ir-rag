# Wiper for sliding electrical contact.

## Abstract
Wipers 10, 12 for sliding electrical contact have a form with gradual and progressive reduction in width and therefore decreasing stiffness and mass as they proceed towards the tip. This form results in higher resonant vibrational frequen cies, enabling a wiper to follow the contact surface in high speed motion with less contact force. The lower contact force in turn produces less wiper distortion and consequently less hysteresis and wear.
