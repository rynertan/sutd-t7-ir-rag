## Description
This invention relates to a crosslinked hyaluronic acid. More particularly, it is concerned with a crosslinked hyaluronic acid or a salt thereof, which is prepared by crosslinking hyaluronic acid hereinafter referred to as HA or a salt thereof with a polyfunctional epoxy compound. HA is widely distributed in connective tissues such as skin, vitreous body or hyaloid, umbilical cord, synovial fluid, rooster comb and so on, like acidic mucopolysaccharides such as chondroitin sulfuric acid, heparan sulfuric acid, keratosulfuric acid. Also, HA is present between cells as a complex with protein in tissue, forms a jelly matrix owing to high water retention and can play an important role in a living body such as in maintenance of cell morphology or protection against attack by bacteria or external power, control of cellular metabolism, or lubricating action in joints K. Meyer, Physiol. Rev., As explained above, HA may exert a different action from mucopolysaccharides having a high charging property, which is believed to be derived from a different factor from a simple high negative charging property, i.e., a high viscoelasticity of HA molecule. Hitherto, it has been attempted to develop the above mentioned actions of HA itself, typically, to treat arthritides, to prevent tissue surface from damage by anterior segment surgery in the ophthamological field, and so on, by administering an isolated, purified HA into a living body or a cell system. However, the HA as in the living body may form a complex with certain, special proteins, show a stable and strong stringiness and a high viscoelasticity and play a specific role, whereas the HA as isolated and purified hardly exhibits stringiness, and it was very difficult in the prior art to extract and purify a highly viscous HA. Moreover, HA is known to undergo enzymatic decomposition or non enzymatic oxidation reduction decomposition after administration to a living body, especially diseased sites W. Pigman, S. Pizvi and H.L. Holley, Arthritis Rheumatism, 4 240, 1961 so that it would be difficult to maintain its original viscosity. Therefore, satisfactory results have not yet been obtained. On the other hand, it has been suggested to crosslink dextran or agarose with a crosslinking agent as disclosed in JP A 1321 1972. Laurent et al. in Acta Chem. Scand. 18 1964 , No.1, p 247 describe the production of gels, potentially suitable for gel filtration, by crosslinking hyaluronic acid with 1, 2, 3, 4 diepoxybutane. The gel products had high swelling capacities in distilled water. Under these circumstances, we have made earnest studies to obtain a crosslinked HA which shows resistance to enzymatic decomposition or none enzymatic oxidation reduction decomposition and, as a result, it has been found that the intended objects can be achieved by crosslinking HA, or a salt thereof, with certain polyfunctional epoxy compounds. Further, it has been found that the present crosslinked HA or salts thereof can also show resistance to hyaluronidase and keep various properties of HA itself and thus can have a wide variety of medical and cosmetic uses. It is, accordingly, a primary object of this invention to provide a novel crosslinked HA or a salt thereof which can exert various useful properties. Another object of this invention is to provide new uses of the present crosslinked HA as medicines, typically, an arthritis treating agent, a vitreous body treating agent or a medical molded product or as skin cosmetics. This invention provides a crosslinked hyaluronic acid or a salt thereof obtainable by crosslinking hyaluronic acid or a salt thereof with a polyfunctional epoxy compound selected from halomethyloxirane compounds, compounds of the formula wherein n is from 2 to 6, and diglycidyl ethers of bisphenol A or bisphenol F, said crosslinked hyaluronic acid or salt exhibiting water solubility and having a crosslinking index of 5 or more per 1000 repeating disaccharide units composed of glucuronic acid and N acetylglucosamine. This invention also provides a crosslinked hyaluronic acid or a salt thereof as defined above which has a non Newtonian index of 0.5 0.8 and shows stringiness. The invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition for treating arthritides comprising a crosslinked hyaluronic acid or a salt thereof as defined above as an active ingredient in combination with a carrier or diluent. The invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition for applying to vitreous body comprising a crosslinked hyaluronic acid or a salt thereof as defined above as an active ingredient in combination with an ophthalmologically acceptable carrier or diluent. This invention further provides a cosmetic composition for applying to skin comprising a crosslinked hyaluronic acid or a salt thereof as defined above in combination with a cosmetically acceptable carrier or diluent. This invention further provides a molding composition for medical molded product comprising a crosslinked hyaluronic acid or a salt thereof as defined above. The HA which may be employed in this invention may be any of those originating from various, non limiting materials such as umbilical cord, rooster comb, vitreous body and so on may have usually a molecular weight of several thousands to several millions. For purification thereof, there may be mentioned methods as disclosed in JP A 145594 1977, 145594 1977, 67100 1979 and 74796 1980. Also, as the HA salts, there may be mentioned an alkali metal salt such as sodium or potassium salt and an alkaline earth metal salt such as calcium or magnesium salt. As used herein, the term polyfunctional epoxy compound is meant to indicate the compounds defined above which have at least one epoxy group and, further, another functional group suitable for crosslinking hyaluronic acid, which may be another epoxy group or a halomethyl group. Such compounds are halomethyloxirane compounds and bisepoxy compounds. As the halomethyloxirane compound there may be mentioned, for example, epichlorohydrin, epibromohydrin, β methylepichlorohydrin, β methylepibromohydrin and the like. As the bisepoxy compound, there may be mentioned, for example, 1,2 bis 2,3 epoxypropoxy ethane, 1,4 bis 2,3 epoxypropoxy butane, 1,6 bis 2,3 epoxypropoxy hexane and a diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A or bisphenol F. The crosslinked HA of this invention may be synthesized, for instance, according to the following procedures usually, HA having a molecular weight of several thousands to several millions or a salt thereof is dissolved in an aqueous solution of an alkali to a concentration of not less than 0.5 , preferably not less than 1.0 and then a water soluble organic solvent is added so as to amount to not less than 30 , preferably not less than 50 , of a whole liquid volume. An aqueous alkali solution has preferably a pH of 8 14, more preferably a pH of 12 14. As the alkali, there may be usually mentioned an alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide or caldium hydroxide an alkali or alkaline earth metal carbonate such as sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate. As the water soluble organic solvent, there may be mentioned, for example, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, acetone or dioxane it may be used alone or in combination therewith. Addition of such water soluble organic solvent may achieve effective reaction proceeding and also prevent the HA from decomposition wish an alkali or from reduction of molecular weight. Next, to the resulting solution may be added one or more of said polyfunctional epoxy compounds and the resultant mixture is subjected to reaction at 0 100 C, preferably 10 60 C, more preferably 20 40 c. Reaction period of time may vary depending upon the reaction temperature applied and 24 48 hours may be preferred at around 20 C, while 2 3 hours may be suitable at around 40 C. In this reaction, the crosslinking index of the resulting crosslinked HA or salt thereof may be controlled by varying the molar ratio of the HA or salt thereof to the polyfunctional epoxy compound. In order to obtain the desired crosslinked HA wherein the crosslinking number is 5 or more per 1000 repeating disaccharides of HA, it is satisfactory to employ one or more moles of the polyfunctional epoxy compound per mole of repeating disaccharide of HA. In the HA having a molecular weight of approximately one million, when 1 10 moles of the polyfunctional epoxy compound are employed to one mole of repeating disaccharide of HA, there could be prepared a crosslinked HA having water solubility and stringiness hereinafter frequently referred to as s crosslinked HA on the other hand, when not less than 10 moles of the epoxy compound are employed, there could be prepared a crosslinked HA having water insolubility and gel form hereinafter frequently referred to as is crosslinked HA . Also, if one may use the HA having a molecular weight of approximately two millions, similar results could be obtained with 2 6 moles or not less than 6 moles of the epoxy compound, respectively. The crosslinked HA which may be employed in this invention may also be prepared according to the following alternative procedures To an alkali solution of the HA or salt thereof is added said water soluble organic solvent and the resulting sticky precipitate is separated and then said polyfunctional epoxy compound is added. Then, reaction may be conducted at a temperature of 50 C or lower to accomplish very efficient reaction. To obtain said sticky precipitate, one may apply decantation, for example, to remove supernatant. Reaction temperature is usually 10 50 C, most preferably 20 40 C. The higher the reaction temperature, the shorter reaction period should be. Generally, about 2 hours may be preferred at around 40 C, while 24 48 hours may be suitable at around 20 C. Illustratively, the s crosslinked HA has a higher viscosity as compared with the starting HA and may usually have a viscosity of 650 60000 centipoises cp in a 1 physiological saline solution 20 C, slide speed, 1 sec ¹ and a non Newtonian index of 0.5 0.8 See H. Kondo, Kitasato Igaku , In application of the present crosslinked HA to a variety of arthritides, the crosslinked HA is usually dissolved in physiological saline to such a sufficient viscosity to pass through an injection needle, namely not more than 50000 cp, preferably 5000 30000 cp 20 C, shear rate 1 sec ¹ . The present arthritis treating agent can show a high safety and a high resistance to tissue enzymes such as hyaluronidase etc. and may be useful for treatment of various arthritides, e.g., arthritis deformans, chronic articular rheumatism and so on. In application of the present crosslinked HA to vitreous body, the crosslinked HA is dissolved in physiological saline so as to obtain a similar viscosity to that for arthritides. Injection may be accomplished, for example, according to Scott method, injection under twin inverted image ophthalmologic scopic examination with silicon oil J.D. Scott, Trains. Ophthalmol. Soc. U.K., In the present skin cosmetics, the crosslinked HA may be preferably incorporated into cosmetics at 0.01 3 upon a whole cosmetic composition. The present cosmetics may be optionally blended with other cosmetic additives such as a water soluble thickening agent, a surface active agent, an oil humectant, an ultraviolet absorbing agent, an alcohol, a chelating agent, a pH adjusting agent, an antiseptic agent, a pigment and a perfume. As the water soluble thickening agent, there may be mentioned, for example, a polyamino acid or a salt thereof a polyacrylic acid or a salt thereof pullulane carboxymethylcellulose and xanthan gum. Such water soluble thickening agent may be usually employed alone or as a mixture of two or more, and may incorporated at 0.01 5 into a cosmetic composition. Also, the present skin cosmetics may be blended with allantoin or its derivative which may be employed as a dermatological disease treating agent or a raw material for cosmetic industry. In this instance, it may be preferably incorporated at 0.01 5 . The present cosmetics can show an excellent water retention and an excellent resistance to enzymes. The present cosmetics may be applied, for example, after shaving, to chaps, cracks, chapped skin and so on in the form of cosmetics such as creams, e.g. a nutrient cream, a hand cream, a body cream, a massage cream nutrient milky lotions face packs face lotions, as well as hair cosmetics. In molding a medical molded product with the present molding material, the present molding material is placed into a desired die, dehydrated and then dried. A molded product may be of any shape, preferably in the shape of a film. There is no limitation to molding procedures and casting is preferable. An aqueous solution or suspension of the present molding material may be coated over a polymer, e.g., polyethylene sheet or film or a support, e.g., glass or metal plate to a desired thickness by means of an applicator, dehydrated and dried and then peeled off from said sheet, film or support to produce a film molded product. A medical molded product obtained from the present molding material when dipped in water or physiological saline may gradually absorb water and may be dissolved. In a living body, the dissolved product may be decomposed with enzymes and the like and, therefore, if a crosslinking index may be controlled, it could be present within a living body or skin only over a necessary period and dissolved away from tissues as lacked tissues will be healed. The present crosslinked HA, when given or applied to a living body, does not show any foreign body reaction and, when applied as a medical molded product, can show a very high safety. This invention will be more fully illustrated by way of the following examples. In 450 ml of a 0.2N sodium hydroxide solution were dissolved 10 g Of HA sodium salt a molecular weight, 7.3 x 10⁵ with cooling and the resulting solution was filtered with a 0.45 µ microfilter. To the filtrate were added 40 ml of a 10N sodium hydroxide solution and then 500 ml of ethanol and 6.0 ml of epichlorohydrin with stirring. The reaction was effected at 20 C for 24 hours and then the reaction mixture was adjusted to pH 6.4 with acetic acid. By addition of 500 ml of ethanol, there was separated a white precipitate, which was then recovered by filtration, washed well with ethanol and dried under reduced pressure. Gel chromatography was effected for the s crosslinked HA as synthesized in the above 1 and for the HA used in that synthesis, employing glass beads CPG 3000 Electro Nucleonics. Inc. in a column 6 x 850 mm . As a developing solvent, there was used a 1.5M sodium chloride solution in water adjusted to pH 8.5 with sodium hydroxide and each 0.52 ml of eluted fractions was separated and quantitatively determined according to a carbazole sulfuric acid method. The results are shown in Fig. 1. In Fig. 1, the hollow circle and full circle show absorbance in each fraction of the s crosslinked H and HA according to a carbazole sulfuric acid method, respectively, and Vo represents an external volume of gel particle. It is apparent from Fig. 1 that the present s crosslinked HA is of a very high molecular weight, as compared with the HA. Using the s crosslinked HA as synthesized in the above 1 and the HA used for synthesis in the form of a 1 physiological saline solution, viscosity was measured at 37 C with varying shear rates by means of a rotary viscometer a viscometer of type E manufactured by Tokyo Keiki Co., Ltd. and non Newtonian index m a b was then calculated. Also, synovia of normal human and that of patient with arthritis deformans were similarly measured for viscosity and non Newtonian index was calculated. The results are shown in Fig. 2. In Fig. 2, the hollow circle , full circle , hollow square and full square show viscosities, respectively, 1 physiological saline solutions of the s crosslinked HA and the HA as well as synovia of normal human and that of patient with light arthritis deformans at various shear rates. It is apparent from Fig. 2 that a 1 physiological saline solution of the present s crosslined HA can show a very similar physical pattern to synovia of normal human. Stringiness of the s crosslinked HA as synthesized in the above 1 and the HA used for synthesis was measured by means of an apparatus modeled after Watanabe stringiness measurement apparatus Hiroshi Ikeuchi, Journal of Orthopedic Surgery of Japan, It is apparent from Fig. 3 that the present s crosslinked HA has a high stringiness. The s crosslinked HA as synthesized in the above 1 was tested for its analgesic effect as stated below. Beagle dogs, irrespective of male and female, were given at the knee joint of either hind leg with 20 µg or 2 mg of bradykinin or acetylcholine as a pain substance together with a physiological saline solution containing the s crosslinked HA at 2.5 mg 0.5 ml and then changes in medicated hind leg loading were measured with lapse of time. Also, a physiological saline solution containing the HA sodium salt at 5 mg 0.5 ml as used as a starting material in the above 1 was used as a control instead of the s crosslinked HA solution. Analgesic effect was compared with 50 load recovery time at a normal time. The results are shown in Table 1. It is apparent from Table 1 that the present s crosslinked HA shows a potent analgesic effect similarly to the HA sodium salt. To 10 ml of a 1 aqueous solution of HA potassium salt a molecular weight, 1.7 x 10⁶ were added 0.1 ml of 10N potassium hydroxide and 5 ml of methanol and then 17 mg of epibromohydrin were added with stirring. Reaction was carried out at 20 C for 24 hours. Then, the reaction mixture was adjusted to pH 6.5 with acetic acid and 10 ml of ethanol were added to produce a white precipitate. It was recovered by filtration and dried under reduced pressure. Following the same procedures as in Example 1 1 except that there was employed as a starting material HA sodium salt with a molecular weight of 7.3 x 10⁵, there were synthesized 3 sorts of the following s crosslinked HA. Viscosity of a 1 0.1M acetic acid pH 5.0 solution or said s crosslinked HA or HA sodium salt used for synthesis was measured 20 C, slide speed 1.0 sec ¹ to give the following results To the solution was added bovine testicle hyaluronidase at 0.09 by weight. Reaction was carried out at 50 C and viscosity was measured after 15, 35, 55 and 70 minutes. Ratio to viscosity before reaction was calculated. The results are shown in Fig. 4. In Fig. 4, hollow square , hollow triangle Δ , hollow circle and full circle represents ratios to viscosity before reaction at various reaction times in acetic acid solutions of s crosslinked HA A , B and C and HA sodium salt. It is apparent from Fig. 4 that the present s crosslinked HA has a higher resistance to hyaluronidase, as compared with HA and that the higher crosslinking index is, the higher the resistance is. In 500 ml of 1N sodium hydroxide were dissolved 10 g of HA sodium salt a molecular weight 7.3 x 10⁵ under cooling and 500 ml of ethanol and 35 ml of epichlorohydrin were added. Reaction was carried out at 40 C for 2 hours. 500 ml of water were added to the reaction mixture, which was then neutralized with acetic acid. The mixture was centrifuged at 3000 rpm and the precipitate was well washed with a 1.0M aqueous solution of sodium chloride. It was then washed with a 0.15M aqueous solution of sodium chloride, dehydrated with ethanol and dried. The is crosslinked HA as synthesized in the above 1 was weighed at 10.00, 5.56, 2.94, 2.00, 1.67 and 1.25 mg and suspended in 15 ml of 0.00167M acetic acid. To the suspensions was added and throughly admixed each 1.0 ml of a 0.00167 acetic acid solution of 0.5 collagen obtained and purified by dissolving bovine derma collagen with pepsin . The resulting mixture was stirred well for 10 minutes and then centrifuged at 3000 rpm. The precipitate was washed well with 0.00167M acetic acid, collagen was dissolved out with 2M guanidine hydrochloric acid pH 7.0 and quantitatively determined according to Procop method. Also, according to Nagasawa et al method Y. Inoue and K. Nagasawa, Carbohydr. Res., It is apparent from Fig. 5 that the is crosslinked HA shows an affinity to collagen. To a suspension of 500 mg of the is crosslinked HA as synthesized in the above 1 in a 0.15M aqueous solution of sodium chloride were added 10 ml of a 0.1 solution of proteoglycan, which was prepared from bovine new born costal cartilage according to Rosenberg method L. Rosenberg et al., J. Biol. Chem. It is apparent from Table 2 that the is crosslinked HA shows an affinity to proteoglycan. In 100 ml of 1.0N sodium hydroxide were dissolved 2.0 g of HA sodium salt a molecular weight, 2.0 x 10⁶ under cooling and 100 ml of dioxane and 4.3 g of 1,4 bis 2,3 epoxypropoxy butane were added. Reaction was effected at 40 C for 2 hours. To the reaction mixture were added 200 ml of water, the resultant mixture was neutralized with 1N hydrochloric acid and then centrifuged at 3000 rpm. The precipitate was washed well with a 1.0M aqueous solution of sodium chloride, and a 0.15M aqueous solution of sodium chloride, dehydrated with ethanol and then dried. In 5.0 ml of 1N sodium hydroxide was dissolved each 100 mg of HA sodium salts having molecular weights of 3.7 x 10⁵ and 7.3 x 10⁵. To each solution were added 5 ml of ethanol and 25, 50, 100 and 200 µl of epichlorohydrin, respectively. Reaction was effected at 40 C for 2 hours. After completion of the reaction, post treatment was carried out in the same manner as in Example 1, 1 . Also, in 7.5 ml of 1N sodium hydroxide were dissolved 75 mg of HA sodium salt with a molecular weight of 1.7 x 10⁶. To the solution were added 7.5 ml of ethanol and 40 µl or 80 µl of epichlorohydrin and reaction was effected at 40 C for 2 hours. Further, reaction was carried out with 2 ¹⁴C epichlorohydrin available from Amersham Japan Co., Ltd. under the same reaction condition as above. The degree of Crosslinking rate was calculated from the radioactivity of this labelled compound. The relationship between degree of crosslinking and viscosity is shown in Table 3. It is apparent from Table 3 that the degree of crosslinking is proportional to viscosity. Male ddY strain mice of 4 weeks of age were preliminarily fed over 1 week. At the begining of test, a body weight of mice was 21 27 g. Mice were divided into groups, each group consisting of 15 animals. To each group was intraperitoneally administered the s crosslinked HA of Example 1 in the form of a 0.5 physiological saline solution thereof at 1 ml 10 g of body weight 500 mg kg , a 1 physiological saline solution thereof at 1 ml 10 g of body weight 1000 mg kg or a physiological saline solution at 1 ml 10 g of body weight. Following Irwin method, general manifestations were observed at the same time every day. After 7 days from administration, 5 animals of each group were sacrificed and, after 14 days, remaining surviving animals were sacrificed. Administered sites and main organs were visually observed. The results are shown as seen below. 12 rabbits an average body weight of 3 kg were subcutaneously sensitized three times at ten day intervals with a mixture of 0.5 ml of a physiological saline solution of egg white albumin 10 mg ml with 0.5 ml of a physiological saline solution of Freund s complete adjuvant 10 mg ml . On the ninth day from final sensitization, allergic arthritis was provoked by adminstering 0.2 ml of a physiological saline solution of egg white albumin 5 mg ml as an antigen into cavity of knee joint. Then, 0.1 ml of a physiological saline solution of s crosslinked HA 20 mg ml was administered into cavity of knee joint together with 0.1 ml of a physiological saline solution of egg white albumin 10 mg ml . After 3, 7 and 14 days from administration, the number of leaked cells within cavity of joint was measured. The results are shown in Table 4. It was apparent from Table 4 that the number of leaked cells in clearly reduced by administering the crosslinked HA. The following experiment was carried out by using a 1 physiological saline solution of the s crosslinked HA. In 10 rabbits an average body weight of 3 kg wherein experimental retinal ablation was brought about by drawing cortical vitreous body or hyaloid with a pincette an ophthamologic forceps , there was made an exit hole in sclera of right eye to remove fluid under retina, while there was made one incision flat part of corpus ciliare. Under examination by a binocular indirect ophthalmoscope, s crosslinked HA was slowly injected by advancing a crosslinked HA injection needle behind lens. When retina was restored with removal of fluid under retina, injection needle and exit needle were drawn off. Removal and injection were repeated mutually through opposite holes so that a cavity in vitreous body was replaced with the crosslinked HA as far as possible. After 10 days, restored state was observed by means of a funduscopic camera. As a result, retinal ablation was observed to be completely recovered in 7 rabbits restoration rate, 70 . Male Wistar strain rats with 4 weeks of age were used for the following experiment, each group consisting of 6 animals. Animals were hair cut with electric hair clippers and then intramuscularly injected with pentobarbital sodium. Skin in the back was incised to about 2 cm at right and left parts and incised portions were immediately sewn by means of Michel sewing apparatus. After sewing, a 0.1 physiological saline solution of the s crosslinked HA, a 0.2 physiological saline solution of allantoin or a mixture of said s crosslinked HA solution and said allantoin solution in equal volume was coated over the left part with 0.1 ml once a day over 2 weeks. As control, physiological saline was coated over the right part. After 2 weeks, rats were sacrificed, sewing needles were removed and skin strip was prepared with a length of 2 cm, which each 1 cm was cut right and left at the center of said incision part, and a section of 1 cm. Tensile resistance of skin strip was measured by means of Tensitoron all purpose tester RTM 50 available from Toyo Baldwin K.K. . Wound healing effect was determined from ratios to control. The results are shown in Table 5. Using the s crosslinked HA 1 in Example 1 and crosslinked HA as prepared in the same manner as in Example 1 except for employing varying amounts of epichlorohydrin, as shown below the following crosslinked HA 2, 3, 4 and 5, were prepared as films. Each 1.5 aqueous solution of above HA was coated over a polyvinyl chloride plate to a certain thickness by means of an applicator and dehydrated by heating with hot air at 40 C for 20 hours. Each coated film was peeled off to form a film with a thickness of 0.003 cm. Also, a 1.5 aqueous solution of HA molecular weight, 800000 was treated in the same manner as above to form a HA film with a thickness of 0.003 cm as control. Tensile resistance of the film was measured by means of Tensitron all purpose tester RTM 50 available from Toyo Baldwin K.K. . The results are shown in Table 6. To 5 mg of each film as prepared in the above 1 were added in a test tube 10 ml of physiological saline and the resulting mixture was allowed to stand for 30 minutes. Test tube was vigorously shaken up and down 20 times and then allowed to stand for one day. Again, test tube was vigorously shaken up and down 20 times and then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 30 minutes. 0.1 ml of supernatant was recovered and determined for uronic acid according to carbazole sulfuric acid method to determine elution rate. Once again, test tube was vigorously shaken up and down 20 times and then allowed to stand for one day. Thereafter, elution rate was determined in the smae manner as above. The aforesaid procedures were repeated for 18 days. The results are shown in Fig. 6. In Fig. 6, full circle , hollow circle , X mark and dotted circle represent, respectively, elution rates after 1, 2, 3 and 18 days. The HA film was completely dissolved when allowed to stand at the first 30 minutes period. It is apparent from Fig. 6 that solubility is reduced as viscosity or crosslinking index is increased. Each 7.6 mg of the crosslinked HA 1 film and HA film as in the above 1 was embedded into 10 male Hartley strain guinea pigs with 4 weeks of age an average body weight of 250 g under the skin of back, incision part was sutured with nylon threads of 5 6 needles and then disinfected. After the 2nd, 5th, 10th and 20th days from transplantation, guinea pigs were killed with ether and then tissue with 3 x 4 cm was taken out from the under part of the subcutaneous layer of transplanted sites. The tissue thus taken was dipped and extracted into 40 ml of a 4M aqueous solution of guanidine at room temperature for 24 hours under stirring. As control, the tissue of the same part in non treated quinea pigs was similarly treated. By carbazole sulfuric acid method, uronic acid was measured to determine residual rate. The results are shown in Fig. 7, wherein hollow circle and full circle represent, respectively, residual rates of crosslinked HA 1 film and HA film. It is apparent from Fig. 7 that the present crosslinked HA 1 film can remain within tissues for a more prolonged period, as compared with the HA film. Also, it can be seen from the results of the above 2 and 3 that a storage period of crosslinked HA in living body may be optionally controlled by controlling crosslinking index in crosslinked HA. The experimental apparatus provided with a pendulum as shown in Fig. 8 is to record electrical signals corresponding to inclinational angles of an artificial hip joint, which angles are measured by an inclinometer which is set right above the artificial hip joint supported on the central upper portion of the pendulum. Here, the inclinational angle is converted into the corresponding electrical signal. the artificial hip joint is composed of ceramic sphere or ceramic porous ball. By using the apparatus as shown in Fig. 8, the fluid lubrication time was measured with respect to HA having no stringiness, and normal human joint fluid and crosslinked HA 1 both having stringiness. For HA, a sample having a molecular weight of 85 x 10⁴ was used in physiological saline solutions having concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.5 and 2.0 , respectively. Crosslinked HA 1 was used as a 0.5 solution in a physiological saline. For the normal human joint fluid, a sample having an HA concentration of 3.4 mg ml was used. A porous sphere was filled with a test liquid as the lubricating fluid, and the fluid lubrication time was measured by starting the free swinging with an intial amplitude of 5 rad immediately after loading with 2 kg and then recording the angle variation with the lapse of time as a swinging wave pattern. An example of the thus obtained wave pattern is shown in Fig. 9, in which the region A corresponds to fluid film lubrication and the region B corresponds to boundary lubrication. As a result, with respect to HA, it was found that the fluid lubrication time was extended in proportion to the HA concentration, as shown in Fig. 10, in which are shown also the fluid lubrication times for the normal human joint fluid and the crosslinked HA 1, respectively. Therefore, it is considered that a crosslinked HA 1 having stringiness acts advantageously as a fluid lubricant which contributes to the lubrication mechanism of a joint. The stringinesses of NF SF and OA SF were measured by adding HA having a molecular weight of 7.3 x 10⁵ and crosslinked HA 1 to NH SF and OA SF, respectively, so that the concentrations thereof might be 0.35 . Further, NH SF was treated by a hyarulonidase immobilized on a formylcellulofine manufactured by Chissokogyo K.K., Japan , and to the thus obtained treated solution hereinafter referred to as NF SF deg HA was added HA or crosslinked HA so that the concentration thereof might be 0.35 to measure the stringiness thereof. The results are shown in Table 7. The stringiness was measured by using a Watanabe type apparatus for measuring stringiness see Ideuchi, Nippon Seikeigeka Zasshi From the analysis of NF SF and OA SF, it was found that NH SF shows higher HA concentration, viscosity and stringiness as compared with OA SF. It is not absolutely clear how the stringiness acts on a joint, but it can be supporsed that the stringiness plays a great role in the joint lubricatability. If the HA in NH SF is degraded, the stringiness of the NH SF is lost, and when a higher molecular weight HA or crosslinked HA 1 is added to the resulting NH SF, the lost stringiness can be recovered to some extent. In such a case, crosslinked HA is more effective than HA. Therefore, it may be considered that NH SF is composed of a high molecular weight HA bonded to a certain kind of protein through their affinity, thereby showing the stringiness. On the other hand, it may be considered that OA SF shows small stringiness due to the HA having its molecular weight reduced, or being deficient, or to the deficiency of a protein or proteins to be bonded with HA. Therefore, it can be understood that it is very effective to introduce a crosslinked HA having stringiness to a diseased joint.
