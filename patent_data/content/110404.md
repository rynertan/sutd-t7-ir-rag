## Abstract
When an actuator 21 held in a body 12, 13 of an insulat ing material is activated, one 28a of arms of a conductive tor sion spring 28 in the body is displaced towards the other arm 28b . By this displacement, the arm is inserted between con tact portions of a pair of leg pieces of a conductive clip 32 disposed between the actuator 21 and the coil portion 28c of the torsion spring, by which a terminal 14 connected to the other arm 28b and a terminal 17 connected to the clip 32 are connected via the torsion spring 28 .
