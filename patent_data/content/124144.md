# Elevation step scanner.

## Abstract
An optical scanning device includes a rotatable sub stantially planar disc 34 and a substantially planar reflec tive member 36 . The disc 34 has a first portion 48 which is reflective and a second portion 50 which is transmis sive. The planar reflective member 36 is arranged in a fixed position behind the disc 34 such that the normal to the planar reflective member subtends a nonzero angle with respect to the disc axis. As the disc is rotated, the light rays to be scanned are alternately reflected by the reflective portion 48 of the disc and by the fixed reflective member 36 onto a fixed detector 60 . Due to the different elevation angles of the disc and the fixed mirror, different bundles of parallel rays of light are scanned onto the detector 60 .
