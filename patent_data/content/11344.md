# Water in oil emulsion.

## Abstract
The invention provides fat continuous emulsions con taining medium melting gelling agents, i.e. those with a sotening point of 33 C and a sharp decrease in gel strength at 45 70 C, the gel strength below the softening point being 0.1 30 N cmÂ². Suitable gelling agents include e.g. carrageenan locust bean gum mixtures.
