## Description
NOVEL 9,10 BIS PHENYLETHYNYL ANTHRACENES The invention, described herein, was made in the performance of work supported by the Office of Naval Research Contract No. N 00014 77 C 0634 , and is subject to the provisions of ASPR 7 104.18, December 1969, and ASPR 7 302.23 b long form, August 1977. The invention relates to novel fluorescer compounds, to mixtures containing those compounds which are useful for generating chemiluminescence, and to the use of such mixtures for generating chemiluminescence. Zweig and Maulding, in U.S. Patents Nos.3,557,233 and 3,729,426, and Maulding, in U.S. Patent No.3,888,786 described 9,10 bis phenylethynyl anthracenes substituted by chloro, bromo, fluoro, or lower alkyl groups and their use as fluorescers with certain oxalic compounds which react with peroxide to produce chemiluminescence. Arthen and Manfre, in U.S. Patent ApplicationSerial No. 341,390, filed January 21, 1982, describe 9,10bis C4 C22 alkylphenylethynyl anthracenes, mixtures containing such compounds, and the use of such mixtures for generating chemiluminescence. The invention provides fluorescers for chemiluminescent mixtures that will have higher chemiluminescence efficiencies as measured by the quantum yield, and will have higher light output as measured by the light capacity, than those described by Zweig and Maulding. The invention provides fluorescers for chemiluminescent mixtures that have slightly lower light capacities and quantum yields than those described byArthen and Manfre. However, the fluorescers of this invention are more readily soluble in polar organic solvents, such as dimethyl phthalate, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, and ethyl acetate, than the fluorescers of Earthen and Manfre. Summary of the Invention The invention provides novel fluroescer compounds having the formula I ,EMI2.1 wherein R is selected from the group consisting of C1 toC8 alkyl, C4 to C8 cycloalkyl, and C3 to C6 alkenyl. Compounds of formula I can be prepared by reacting about two molecular proportions of the corresponding lithium phenylacetylide with anthraquinone to obtain a 9,10 dihydro 9,10 dihydroxy 9,10 bi phe ethynyl anthracene and converting the latter to the corresponding 9,10 bis phenylethynyl anthracene by methods described by Maulding in U.S. Patent 3,911,038. Illustrative examples of suitable compounds of formula I include the following 9,10 bis 2 4 methoxymethyl phenyll ethynyli anthracene, 9,10 bis 2 4 n butoxymethyl ohenyl ethynyl anthracene, 9,10 bisC2 3 n octyloxymethyl phenyll ethynyl anthracene, 9, 10 bis 2 4 cyclohexyloxymethyl phenyl ethynyl anthracene, 9,10 bis 2 4 allyloxymethyl phenyl ethynylianthracene, 9,10 bis 2 4 methallyloxymethyl phenyl ethynyllanthracene, The compositions of formula I may comprise mixtures of isomers substituted at the 3 and 4 positions of the phenyl moiety. The term chemiluminescence, as employed herein, is defined as the generation of electromagnetic radiation between about 300 and 1200 nanometers by means of a chemical reaction. The term chemiluminescent reactant is defined as any compound which enters into a chemical reaction with a peroxide component to produce chemiluminescence. The preferred chemiluminescent reactants for use in this invention are oxalic acid esters, and certain oxamides which are described for example in U.S. Patents Nos. 3,597,362, 3,888,786, and 4,226,738. The term composition for reaction with a peroxide component to generate chemiluminescence, as employed herein, is defined as a mixture of a compound of formula I and a chemiluminescent reactant in a diluent in concentrations sufficient to produce chemiluminescence by admixing with a peroxide component. Thus, the initial concentrations of the compound of formula I , the reactant compound, and the ingredients of the peroxide component in the reaction mixture must be sufficient to produce chemiluminescence. The term admixing, as used herein, means reacting or sufficiently bringing together component reactants to obtain chemiluminescence. The fluorescer compound of formula I must not readily react with the peroxide component used in this invention, or with the reactant compound, and must be at least partially soluble in the diluent employed. The composition for reaction with a peroxide component to generate chemiluminescence may comprise a liquid which will solubilize the fluorescer compound of formula I and the reactant compound to provide initial concentrations in the reacting system of about 10 3M to about lOM, preferably about 10 1M to about 1M, of the reactant compound and about 10 5M to about 10 1M, preferably about 10 3M to 10 2M, of the fluorescer compoundThis liquid diluent must be relatively unreactive toward the other ingredients of the chemiluminescent mixture. The molar concentrations of the reactant compound, and the fluorescer compound in the composition before addition and reaction with the peroxide component is about 1.1 2.5, preferably about 1.2 1.3, times the molar concentrations of the same materials in the reacting system described above. Typical diluents which can be used in the composition for reaction with a peroxide component include esters, ethers, aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons such as those described for the use in U.S. Patents 3,749,679 and 3,888,786. The most preferred diluent is dibutyl phthalate. Solvent combinations may be used but such combinations should not include strongly electron donating solvents, strongly acidic, or strongly basic solvents. The term diluent, as used herein, is defined as a liquid solvent, or vehicle, for the compound of formula I and the reactant compound. The term peroxide component, as used herein, means a solution of a hydrogen peroxide compound, a hydroperoxide compound, or a peroxide compound in a suitable diluent. The term hydroperoxide compound includes 1 hydrogen peroxide and 2 hydrogen peroxide producing compounds. Hydrogen peroxide is the preferred hydroperoxide compound and may be employed as a solution of hydrogen peroxide in a solvent or as an anhydrous hydrogen peroxide compound such as sodium perborate, sodium peroxide, and the like. Whenever hydrogen peroxide is contemplated to be employed, any suitable compound may be substituted which will produce hydrogen peroxide. Diluents which can be employed for the peroxide component include any liquid which is relatively unreactive toward the hydroperoxide, the chemiluminescent reactant, and the fluorescer compound, and which accommodates a solubility to provide at least 0.01M hydroperoxide solution. Solvents suitable as diluents for the hydroperoxide component include water alcohols, such as ethano, tertiary butanol, or actanol ethers, such as diethyl ether, diamyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dibutyldiethyleneglycol, perfluoropropyl ether, and 1,2di methoxyethane and esters, such as ethyl acetate, ethyl benzoate, dimethyl phthalate, dioctylphthalate, propyl formate. Solvent combinations can, of course, be. used such as combinations of the above with anisole, tetralin, and chlorobenzene, providing said solvent combination accommodates hydroperoxide solubility. However, strong electron donor solvents such as dimethyl formamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, and hexamethyl phosphoramide should not, in general, be used as a major diluent for the peroxide component. The preferred diluent for the peroxide component is a mixture of about 80 volume percent dimethyl phthalate and about 20 volume percent tertiary butanol. The hydrogen peroxide concentration in the peroxide component may range from about 0.2M to about 15M.Preferably, the concentration ranges from about 1M to about 2M. The lifetime and intensity of the chemiluminescent light emitted can be regulated by the use of certain regulators such as 1 by the addition of a catalyst which changes the rate of reaction of hydroperoxide with the compound for formula I . Catalysts which accomplish that objective include those described in M. L. Bender, Chem. Revs., Vol. 60, pg. 53 1960 . Also, catalysts which alter the rate of reaction or the rate of chemiluminescence include those accelerators of U.S. PatentNo. 3,775,366, and decelerators of U.S. Patent Nos.3,691,085 and 3,704,231, or 2 by the variation of hydroperoxide.Both the type and the concentration of hydroperoxide are critical for the purpose of regulation. Preferably, a weakly basic accelerator, such as sodium salicylate, is included in the peroxide component to control the lifetime of the chemical lighting system.The concentration of weakly basic accelerator used in the peroxide component may range from about 10 6M to about 10 2M, preferably from about 10 4M to about 10 . The initial concentration of the ingredients of the peroxide component in the reacting system is about 0.15 to 0.60 of the concentrations in the peroxide com ponenr since the peroxide component comprises about 15 to about 60 volume percent of the reaction mixture. The concentration of the hydroperoxide compound in the chemiluminescent reaction is at least equal to the molar concentration of the chemiluminescent reactant and is preferably 1.2 to 5.0 times the concentration of the chemiluminescent reactant in the reacting system described above. The optimum concentrations must be determined experimentally for each specific system. The following examples are illustrative of the present invention.
