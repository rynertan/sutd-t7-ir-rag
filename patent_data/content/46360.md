# Window assembly.

## Abstract
A window assembly for modifying the appearance of a ve hicle body comprises a glass fibre reinforced polyester panel 28 adapted to bridge a body opening. The polyester panel 28 has at least one opening 29, 31 smaller and of a different configuration than the body opening and formed with a peri pheral rabbet 32 projecting into the opening. An insert 34, 36 complimentary in shape to the smaller opening is posi tioned in the latter adjacent the rabbeted periphery. The insert may take the form of a window pane 34 , a louvered panel, a lamp housing lens 35 , or other substantially planar article. The insert is held in place by an injection mouldable elastomer ic material 38 that in cured condition integrally interlocks the periphery of the insert to the rabbet of the polyester panel.
