# Automatic beam current control systems for television cameras.

## Abstract
An image pickup apparatus or television camera tube 11 , which a signal corresponding to a target current of the television camera tube 11 is supplied to a beam current control electrode G₁ thereof so as thereby to control the beam amplitude to correspond to variations of the amount of light incident thereon, is provided with an automatic beam current control system in which the signal corresponding to the target current is supplied through a line adder circuit 17 to the beam current control electrode G₁ . The line adder circuit 17 may comprise a one horizontal period delay line 15 . Since the control signal supplied to the beam current control electrode G₁ is an added value or an average value of target currents obtained over two scanning periods, a sta ble control signal always is supplied to the beam current control electrode G₁ so that a picked up image signal of high definition, which does not contain a line crawl com ponent, can be obtained.
