# INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEM

## Abstract
An operating system processor 3001 for managing resources concentrically, job processors 3002, ....., 300n for executing processes input output processors 4001,4002, ...., 400n for executing input output processes, a file processor for executing input output processing to a file system, and a main memory 200 are connected together by a common bus 100 . The operating system processor 3001 receives a resource request from the job processors 3002, ....., 300n so as to manage the allotment of resources to the job proces sors by referring to a resource management table 211, 212, ....., 21n , a processor management table 221, 222, ....., 22n , and waiting tables 231, 232, ....., 23n, 241, 242, ....., 24n .
