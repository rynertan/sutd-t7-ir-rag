# Explosive compositions based on time stable colloidal dispersions and a process for the preparation thereof.

## Abstract
A water in oil microemulsion explosive composition based on time stable colloidal dispersions comprising oxy gen supplying salt as a discontinuous phase, insoluble liquid or liquefiable carbonaceous fuel as a continuous phase, homogeneously distributed sensitiser as a further discontinuous phase and an emulsifying agent comprising a combination of at least one conventional water in oil emulsifier and at least one amphiphatic synthetic polyme ric emulsifier selected from graft, block or branch poly mers. Unlike conventional emulsion explosive composi tions, the microemulsion composition of the invention displays exceptional long term storage stability retaining sensitivity to propagation even in small diameter charges. The composition is also tolerant to doping with further fuel and energy enhancing ingredients.
