# A method of generating oxygen for emergency use.

## Abstract
A method of generating oxygen for emergency use, wherein a mixture of solid matters prepared by binding a catalyst such as the powder of manganese dioxide with a water soluble binding agent such as a gum arabic solution and an addition compound of sodium carbonate and hyd rogen peroxide is intermixed with water, so that the solid matters are dissolved allowing the catalyst to gradually come into contact with a solution of hydrogen peroxide resulting from the decomposition of the addition compound of sodium carbonate and hydrogen peroxide, thereby generating oxygen gradually and continuously for an exten ded period of time.
