# Improvements in or relating to electronic telephone exchanges and optical fibre links for use therein.

## Abstract
An electronic telephone exchange of the type employing time space time switching, has an optical fibre data link con necting the space 3 and time switches 2,4 . In order to meet the design requirements for use in a telephone exchange, the fibre optic link has to have fairly well defined performance para meters. In particular the overall diameters of the optical fibres 16 employed in the optical fibre link lies between 180 and 250 microns, preferably 200 microns, and the core diameter of the optical fibres 16 lies in the range 0.6 to 0.95 of the cladding di ameter. Preferably the core diameter lies in the range 160 to 180 microns. The optical fibre link is characterised by the nu merical aperture of the fibre, insertion loss of the fibre, sensitiv ity and dynamic range of the receiver 19 and the power out put and extinction ratio of the transmitter 13 .
