# Contact lenses.

## Abstract
A contact lens adapted for proximate contact with the eyeball comprises a posterior surface A and an anterior surface B, the edge being radiused at r₅. Each surface A,B is a composite of a plurality of optical surfaces each of which is defined by an individual radius of curvature r₁, r₂, r₃, r₄ each of which is accurate to within a tolerance of 0.00025 cm. The lens, which is of hydrophilic polymer has no sharp juncture between the optical and lenticular regions and the posterior surface is preferably aspherical.
