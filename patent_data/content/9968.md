# Scintillation crystal mounting apparatus.

## Abstract
An apparatus for mounting a scintillation crystal 40 in a detector assembly of a gamma imaging device. The mounting apparatus effectively isolates forces applied by a spring biased array of phototubes 12 from a frangible scintillation crystal 40 . The crystal is separately biased to the light pipe 16 using only the minimum force needed to insure good optical coupling.
