# Circuit for eliminating spurious components resulting from burst control in a TDMA system.

## Abstract
In an electronic circuit comprising a modulator 35 and used in each substation of a TDMA system and responsive to a baseband data signal sequence for producing a burst in ac cordance with a first burst control pulse, spurious compo nents resulting in the burst from the first burst control pulse are eliminated either by allowing the data sequence to pass through a low pass filter 36 after switching 45 the sequence by the first burst control pulse or by filtering the first burst con trol pulse by a low pass filter before switching a local oscilla tion signal by the first control pulse. An additional switching circuit may switch either a modulated signal supplied from the modulator or the local oscillation signal in response to a se cond burst control pulse that disappears after extinction of the first burst control pulse. Alternatively, a modifying circuit rever ses polarities of a preceding and a following data signals im mediately preceding and following the sequence, relative to a leading and a trailing end data signals of the sequence.
