# RADIATION COLLECTOR AND REFLECTOR

## Abstract
A radiation collector and reflector is described which is formed by reflective specular surfaces and by a central plate or axis, said central axis coinciding with the axis of the outer concavo conic specular surface or with a conical axis, whose axis is in turn that of the outer concave specular surface. The specular surfaces are arranged together convergently at variable angles, permitting the radiant energy which strikes the concavity formed by the lateral planes to be concentrated on a plane situated between the exterior surfaces. If the collector has a conical aspect, a tube is situated in the centre of the cone to receive all the radiation. Alternative ly, the collector can have two cones or concentric parallel conical figures in which the radiation striking the exterior conical concavity is reflected on the inner conical convexity and is projected in parallel, concentrated in the same direction as the incident light, parallel to the axes of the two conical figures.
