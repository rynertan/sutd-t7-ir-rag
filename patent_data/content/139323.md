# Electron tube.

## Abstract
Present in an electron tube having a glass envelope portion 1 is an electrode system 3 which is slid in the envelope portion 1 and is centred with respect to the wall 7 of the envelope portion 1 by means of a number of pretensioned springs 6 . The springs 6 extend from a supporting point B which is fixed with respect to the electrode system 3 over their effective spring length towards the wall 7 of the envelope portion 1 and press against the wall 7 while forming a contact point A. A stick slip movement of the springs over the surface of the wall 7 during the sliding movement of the electrode system 3 is avoided in that the springs 6 each extend over their effective spring length according to a straight line between supporting point B and contact point A. The occurrence of glass damage to the wall 7 is minimized by the said measure.
