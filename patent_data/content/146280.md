# Socket, for an integrated circuit package, incorporating serially coupled springs.

## Abstract
A socket 10 for an integrated circuit package comprises a frame 11 a plurality of mechanical contacts mounted in the frame 11 such that they align with corresponding pins on the package a contact deflecting member 14 in the frame which is moved to engage and deflect the contacts against the pins an actuator 16 in the frame which is manually moved to en gage and move the contact deflecting member 14 and a spring 17 in the frame which engages and is deflected by the actuator 16 when the actuator moves the contact deflecting member 14 the spring being mounted to deflect in series with the contacts to enable the recited socket components to have dimensional tolerances and yet avoid the overstressing and understressing of the contacts by the contact deflecting mem ber.
