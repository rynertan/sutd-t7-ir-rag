# Aluminium reduction cells.

## Abstract
An aluminum reduction cell includes an anode 10 , electrolyte 12 , a cathode 14 , a potlining 16 which may be of alumna and cathode current collectors embedded therein. The collectors include a section comprising a major proportion by volume of bodies 22 , e.g. of titanium diboride or a TiBâ‚‚ Al cermet, joined or surrounded by aluminum, the section being so positioned that the aluminium is at least partly fluid when the cell is in operation. The bodies, which are preferably close packed, may be cubic or cuboid or in the form of sheets or thin slabs arranged with their major faces parallel to one another and to the axis of the collector section. The collectors show good electrical conductivity together with satisfactory resistance to magnetic stirring and impact and transverse forces.
