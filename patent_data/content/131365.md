## Description
A PROCESS FOR PREPARING A HYDANTOIN DERIVATIVE The present invention relates to an improved process for preparing hydantoin derivative from a hydrophobic aldehyde or ketone. The hydantoin derivative may be readily chemically hydrolyzed into DL amino acid, followed, as required by optical resolution to afford the desired L or D isomer.Also, the hydantoin derivative can be enzymatically converted into optically a amino acid, as disclosed inJapanese Patent Publication No. 13850 1962 and U.S. PatentNo. 4,211,840. The reaction to synthesize a hydantoin from the corresponding aldehyde or ketone the Bucherer s hydantoin synthesis is well known, in which the aldehyde or ketone is allowed to react with ammonium, cyanide and carbonate ions in an aqueous medium. When the aldehyde or ketone used as the starting material is hydrophobic, it is common practice to use a water soluble organic solvent, such as alcohols, in order to permit the reaction to proceed in a homogeneous system for example, Japanese PatentPublication No. 5702 1975 , as otherwise polymerization and other side reactions would take place, particularly with aldehydes which are unstable under alkaline conditions, resulting in a drastically lowered product yield.The use of an organic solvent, however, necessitates its recovery step, thus complicating the entire process and adding to the cost for energy required for its recovery and other production costs. We have found that it is possible to retard the aforementioned side reactions and therefore to avoid the reduction in yield of the intended reaction, if the contact of the hydrophobic material with the aqueous solution is effectively facilitated by the addition of a surface active agent or by vigorous mechanical agitation, that is, if the reaction is carried out in an emulsified condition. This invention was based on these findings. Hydrophobic aldehydes or ketones defined in the present invention may be those having a solubility less than 10 by weight in water at 250C. Examples of such aldehydes and ketones includes phenylacetaldehyde, benzaldehyde, acetophenone and methylisobutylketone. In carrying out the process of the present invention, the reaction conditions, such as reaction temperature and time, and the ratio of the reactants, may be the same as those commonly adopted for hydantoin synthesis, or may be changed appropriately as required, except that the reaction is conducted in the absence of organic solvent and in an emulsified condition by the addition of a surface active agent or by vigorous mechanical agitation. It is preferred that at least one mole of free ammonia or ammonium hydroxide based on the aldehyde or ketone is present in the reaction system. The preferred sources of ammonium ions are ammonia and ammonium cyanide. Any water soluble and ionized cyanide may be employed as a source of cyanide ions. From a practical point of view, hydrogen cyanide, ammonium cyanide, and the alkali metal cyanides, more specifically sodium and potassium cyanide, are preferred. The amount of ammonium and cyanide ions should be each at least one mole equivalent per mole of aldehyde or ketone. The source of carbonate ions is equally noncritical, but the carbonates and bicarbonates of sodium, potassium, or ammonium are preferred. The source of carbonate ions should be employed in an equimolecular amount based on the aldehyde or ketone or in a slight excess.Using more than 1.1 moles carbonate ion per mole of aldehyde or ketone has no measurable effect on the yield. In conducting the hydantoin forming reaction in the presence of a surface active agent, particularly when starting from an aldehyde, it is preferable to add a small amount of the surface active agent to an aqueous ammonia solution containing ammonium cyanide and ammonium bicarbonate, followed by addition of the aldehyde, and to allow the reaction to proceed in the emulsified condition. Any types of surface active agents anionic, cationic, nonionic and amphoteric are effective for the process of this invention. Typical examples include sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, dodecylmethylammonium chloride, N lauryl B alanine, and polyoxyethylene 10 nonylphenyl ether. The suitable amount of surface active agent to be added is from 5 to 0.001E, preferably from 0.1 to 0.01 based on the weight of the aldehyde or ketone. Since the agent is very effective with a small amount, its quantity to be used should be reduced to as low a level as practicable for ease of after treatment. When the reaction is carried out with vigorous mechanical agitation, it is preferable to add the aldehyde or ketone to an aqueous ammonia solution containing ammonium cyanide and ammonium carbonate or bicarbonate being vigorously agitated by means of a homogenizer or the like to keep the reaction system in a well emulsified condition.The formed emulsion is held at elevated temperature, preferably 400C to1300C in a closed vessel until the desired hydantoin is formed. As may be apparent from examples and comparative examples given later, the yield is only about 50 60 when the reaction is conducted with ordinary stirring power requirement for agitation 0.1 to 0.5 KW m in the absence of surface active agent, while the desired hydantoin derivative can be formed in about 80 or higher yield if vigorous agitation is adopted power requirement 25 KW m3 . The power requirement for agitation in this process should generally be 1 KW m3 or more, preferably 5 KW m3 or more.This can be accomplished on an industrial scale by, for example, mixing the aldehyde or ketone with an aqueous solution containing ammonium, cyanide and carbonate ions by means of a line mixer and continuously feeding the resulting mixture to a reactor. From the foregoing it will be understood that if a hydrophobic aldehyde or ketone is reacted in an emulsified condition by the addition of a surface active agent or by vigorous mechanical agitation, the corresponding hydantoin can be obtained in high yield comparable with that attained in a homogeneous system using an organic solvent. Thus, the process of this invention provides great advantages of eliminating the step of solvent recovery, with the resultant simplification of the entire manufacturing process and saving of the cost for solvent recovery, while maintaining a high level of yield. The hydantoin thus formed may be isolated from the reaction mixture before being subjected to hydrolysis or may be hydrolyzed without being isolated. Hydrolysis of hydantoin may be performed under known conditions, which may be appropriately modified as required. Isolation of the amino acid from the hydrolyzate can alsp be effected easily by known methods.
