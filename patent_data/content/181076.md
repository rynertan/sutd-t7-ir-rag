# ADJUSTABLE SWIRL MEANS IN AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE

## Abstract
Cylinder intake charge swirl is accentuated by selectively directing gas flow past swirl generating vanes 31 in the intake port 19 which are closest to the cylinder wall and reducing the gas flow past swirl generating vanes 31 furthest from the cylinder wall. This may be accomplished by utilizing asymmetrically variable swirl vanes arranged to reduce flow at lower engine loads through passages 3,4,5,6 furthest from the cylinder wall and to encourage flow through swirl directed passages 1,2,7,8 closer to the cylin der wall.
