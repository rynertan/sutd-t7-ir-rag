# Fuel cell design and assembly and cooling plate therefor.

## Abstract
Bipolar cooling plate 13 for use in a fuel cell has discrete opposite edges 21, 23 and a component 25 carried by the plate defines a plurality of channels 13 for the passage of cooling gas extending along the surface of the plate toward the opposite edges. At least one edge of the channels terminates short of the edge 21, 23 of the plate defining a recess 35 for receiving a fastener.
