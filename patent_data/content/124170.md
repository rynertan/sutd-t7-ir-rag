## Description
Apparatus for axially feeding a wire. The invention relates to an apparatus for axially feeding a wire, for example, a welding wire, which apparatus comprises a housing containing at least one reciprocable wire gripping device, which has a plane of symmetry and comprises first and second wire guides which are located in two walls disposed opposite one another, through which wire guides the plane of symmetry extends, the wire gripping device comprising two inclined walls which are arranged on opposite sides of said plane of symmetry and between which a chamber extends which widens in a direction from the first towards the second wire guide and which contains two spring loaded rolling elements which cooperate one with each of said inclined walls. Such a wire feeding apparatus is known from the paper Schweissen und Schneiden , 82, pp. 56 65 DeutscherVerband fUr Schweissteclmik e.v. . In the known apparatus the housing may comprise one or more reciprocable wiregripping devices each comprising two rolling elements constructed as cylindrical pressure rollers. Such a wire gripping device can be given a reciprocating movement in various ways, for example, by means of a swash plate which is coupled to a motor unit. The known apparatus is used to feed a welding wire from a storage reel to a welding point. The welding wire passes through the wire gripping device, the wire entering the device at the first wire guide and leaving the device at the second wire guide0 Inside the wiregripping device the wire passes between the pressure rollers.The wire is moved when the wire gripping device performs a forward movement, the wire being clamped between the pressure rollers. When the wire gripping device, upon termination of the forward movement, returns to its starting position, the clamping effect of the pressure rollers is smaller, so that the pressure rollers slide and or roll back along the wire without moving it. A disadvantage of the known wire feeding apparatus is that the contact surfaces between the pressure rollers and the wire to be moved are comparatively small as a result of which, in the forward movement of the wire gripping device, such high pressure forces occur that the wire is plastically deformed locally. A further dis advantage is that only after such deformation the wire do the pressure rollers get suffidient grip on the wire to pull it along during the movement of the wire gripping device. The movement of the wire during the forward movement of the wire gripping device is consequently considerably smaller than the movement of the wire gripping device itself It is the obJect of the invention to improve the wire feeding apparatus of the kind mentioned in the opening paragraph in such manner that the said disadvantages do not occur. For that purpose the wire feeding apparatus according to the invention is characterized in that the wire gripping device comprises two grippers which are arranged symmetrically with respect to the plane of symmetry and each of which, with on the side thereof remote from the plane of symmetry, cooperates with one of the rolling elements. To move a wire by means of the apparatus according to the invention, one end of the wire is passed between the grippers of the block wire gripping device via the first wire guide. When the wire gripping device is then given a forward movement, the rolling elements roll on the tapering inclined walls and urge the grippers towards each other. As a result of the frictional forces occurring between the grippers and the wire, the wire is then pulled along with the wire gripping device. In the return movement of this device the rolling elements roll in the opposite direction, so that the frictional forces between the grippers and the wire become smaller. The wire support and guide for the wire to be fed. The cross sectional shape of the channel like recesses is preferably adapted to the cross section of the wire. An advantage of this embodiment is that during the forward movement of the wire gripping device the grippers each contact the wire over a large area. As a result the grippers exert a firm grip on the wire in spite of small pressure forces. Another preferred embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention is characterized in that the channel like recess widens in a semi funnel like manner at the end which is nearer the first wire guide. Inserting a wire between the grippers of the wire gripping device, for example, when the apparatus is started or when, during operation, the wire has to be changed, can easily be performed in this construction. It is only necessary for the wire to be threaded into the widened end of the recesses, after which a small axial force is sufficient to move the wire further into the wire gripping device. A favourable preferred embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention is characterized in that each of the grippers, on its side remote from the plane of symmetry, comprises a flange which on a side thereof which faces towards the second wire guide, cooperates with one of the rolling elements. An advantage of this embodiment is that in a simple but efficacious manner the correct positioning of the rolling elements relative to the grippers is obtained and is maintained during operation. The flange of each gripper is preferably located at a distance from that end of the gripper which is nearer the first wire guide. An advantage of this is that in the return movement of the wire gripping device the grippers do not perform a tilting movement relative to the wire. The favourable result of this is that in the forward movement of the wire gripping device the wire is gripped very rapidly is not moved with the wire gripping device during the latter s return movement but on the contrary slides out of the wire gripping device at the second wire guide. When the forward and return movements of the wire gripping device succeed each other continuously, an intermittent axial feed of the wire occurs. In the wire feeding apparatus according to the invention the grippers grip the wire over a part of its length such that the pressure forces occurring are small.This has the advantage that any deformations of the wire occurring at the contact areas is usually of an elastic nature. A further advantage is that in the forward movement of the wire gripping device the grippers rapidly get a grip on the wire. A favourable result of this is a high efficiency of the apparatus. Therefor the apparatus is very suitable for use with HIS and pland MIG welding systems. The apparatus according to the invention may be used, for example, to feed a welding wire or cored wire electrodes from a storage reel to a welding point. The apparatus is suitable for use both in automatic and in semi automatic welding devices. The use of the apparatus according to the invention is not restricted to welding wire. Wires of another, metallic or non metallic composition can also be fed by means of the apparatus. The apparatus furthermore is suitable not only for wires having a circular cross section but also for wires having other cross sections, for example, a rectangular cross section. If desired, rod shaped articles may be moved by means of an apparatus according to the invention. A preferred embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention is characterized in that each of the grippers, in its side which faces the plane of symmetry, comprises a channel like recess which extends in a dinec tion from the first towards the second wire guide. In this embodiment the channel like recesses in the grippers complement one another to fotm an excellent and pulled along by the grippers. Another favourable preferred embodiment of the apparatus in accordance with the invention is characterized in that each of the grippers tapers in the form of a wedge in a direction towards the first wire guide, the side of the gripper remote from the plane of symmetry lying in a plane which encloses an angle with the plane of symmetry, in which 1 4 2 100, and each of the inclined walls of the block wire gripping device lying in a plane which encloses an angle with the plane of symmetry, in which 8 g p 240. Favourable results have been obtained experimentally with angles X andS,4 which are within these limits indicated. Optimum results have been obtained with an angle ç 60 and an angle A 150. A further embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention is characterized in that at least the first wire guide is constructed as a sleeve. This embodiment has the advantage that the wire is readily guided and centred as it enters the wiregripping device. The invention further provides an apparatus which is characterized in that the housing contains a second wire gripping device which is identical to the first wiregripping device, and a guiding mechanism to which both wire gripping devices are connected, the first wire guide of one wire gripping device being situated opposite the second wire guide of the other wire gripping device and the two wire gripping devices being coupled to a driving unit reciprocated thereby in such a way that the two devices move in opposite directions simultaneously. With this arrangement a wire can be fed axially in pulsatory movements which succeed one another continuously. By varying the frequency with which the two wire gripping devices reciprocate, the mean speed of the wire can be adjusted to any desired value. Embodiments of the invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to the drawings, in which Fig. 1 shows diagrammatically a wire feeding apparatus according to the invention having two wiregripping devices, Fig. 2 is an axial sectional view of an embodiment of one of the wire gripping devices of the apparatus shown in Figure 1, Fig. 3 is a sectional view of the wire gripping device shown in Fig. 2, taken on the line Ill Ill in Fig.2, Fig. 4 is a part sectional plan view of an embodiment of the apparatus in accordance with the invention, Fig. 5 is a side elevation, partly in section, of the apparatus shown in Figure 4, the section being taken on the line V V in Fig. 4, and Fig. 6 is an end elevation, partly in section, of the apparatus shown in Fig. 4, the section being taken on the line VI VI in Fig. 4. The wire feeding apparatus according to the invention shown diagrammatically in Figure 1 comprises two wire gripping devices 1 and 2 which are of identical construction and are each connected to slides 3 and 4, respectively. Each of the slides 3 and 4 is guided by a pair of leaf springs 5, 6 and 7, 8, respectively, of a guiding mechanism. The leaf springs 5, 6, 7 and 8 are connected to a housing 9. The apparatus further comprises a driving unit 10 having a driving shaft 11. The driving shaft 11 comprises a shaft portion 12 the centre line of which encloses an acute angle g with the centre line of the driving shaft 11. The angle K is preferably Q 150. A wobble element 13 is journalled on the shaft portion 12 so that the latter can rotate relatively to the wobble element. Two hinged joints 14 and 15 are connected to the wobble element at diametrically opposed points thereon.The hinged joints 14 and 15 are also connected to the slides 3 and 4, respectively. A bore 16 extends through the driving shaft 11 and through the shaft portion 12. The construction of the identical wire gripping devices 2 will be described in detail with reference toFigures 2 and 3 which show the wire gripping device 1 on an enlarged scale. This device comprises a first wire guide 17 and a second wire guide 18 and has a plane of symmetry which passes through the two wire guides 17 and 18 and is perpendicular to the plane of the drawing. In Figures 2 and 3 the plane of symmetry is represented by the lines H H and V V. The wire gripping device 1 has inclined walls 19 and 20, respectively, on opposite sides of the plane of symmetry. The inclined walls 19 and 20 lie in planes which each enclose an angle ss with the plane of symmetry.The angle is preferably ss 80 and C 240. A chamber 21 in which wedge shaped grippers 22 and 23, respectively, are accommodated on opposite sides of the plane of symmetry extends between the walls 19 and 20. On their sides 24 and 25, respectively, which are remote from the plane of symmetry the grippers 22 and 23 comprise flanges 26 and 27, respectively. Each of the sides 24 and 25 lies in a plane which encloses an angle 06 with the plane of symmetry. Preferably 1 g 100. Two rolling elements 28 and 29 on which two springs 31 and 32 act via a pressure member 30 are also accommodated in the chamber 21. Of course, one centrally arranged spring may alternatively be used. The rolling element 28 cooperates on the one hand with the inclined wall 19 and on the other hand with the side 24 and the flange 26 of the gripper 22. Similarly, the rolling element 29 cooperates with the inclined wall 20 and with the side 25 and the flange 27 of the gripper 23. The flanges 26 and 27 preferably have a shape, for example the shape shown in Figure 2, such that the area of contact with the rolling elements 28 and 29 is small. The sides 33 and 34 of the grippers 22 and 23 which face the plane of symmetry may have smooth surfaces or they may be roughened. The sides 33 and 34 preferably comprise channel like recesses 35 and 36, respectively, which are widened at their ends 37 and 38, respectively, which are nearer the first wire guide 17. The channellike recesses 35 and 36 may have smooth walls or they may be roughened at least over a part of their length, for example, by knurls each extending transversely of the recess. The wire gripping devices 1 and 2 are so positioned relative to each other that the first wire guide 17 of the wire gripping device 2 is disposed opposite the second wire guide 18 of the wire gripping device 1, as is shown in Figure 1. In the operating condition the above apparatus a wire 39 is threaded through the wire gripping devices 1 and 2 via the bore 16. When the driving shaft 11 rotates, the wobble element 13 performs a wobbling, non rotating movement which is converted by the hinged joints 14 and 15 into reciprocating movements of the slides 3 and 4 such that the wire gripping devices 1 and 2 are moved in oppositely directions simultaneously.When the wire gripping device 1 performs a forward movement, that is a movement in which the wire gripping device moves away from the driving unit 10, the rolling elements 28 and 29 in the wire gripping device 1 roll on the inclined walls 19 and 20 in a direction such that they move towards each other and urge the grippers 22 and 23 against the wire 39 which is thereby gripped and pulled along with the wire gripping device 1. In the meantime the wire gripping device 2 moves in the opposite direction, the grippers 22 and 23 of this device 2 sliding back along the wire. Upon termination of the forward movement of the wire gripping device 1, the wire gripping device 2 begins its forward movement, in which the wire is pulled along with the wiregripping device 2 in the same manner as described for the wire gripping device 1.In the meantime the wire gripping device 1 performs its return movement, in which the grippers 22 and 23 of this device 1 slide back along the wire.When the movements of the two wire gripping devices 1 and 2 succeed each other continnously, the wire is moved in the axial direction in a pulsatory manner. The apparatus according to the invention is suitable for feeding wires of different diameters, without it being necessary to change components of the device.Nor is it necessary to adjust the device differently. The rolling elements 28 and 29 of the wire gripping devices 1 and 2 in combination with the inclined walls 19 and 20 permit a variable spacing between the grippers 22 and 23.As a result of this, when a wire is threaded through the wire gripping devices the grippers 22 and 23 automatically assume the positions associated with the diameter of the wire Figures 4, 5 and 6 show a practical embodiment of the wire feeding apparatus in accordance with the invention. The embodiment comprises a housing 50 having two reciprocable wire gripping devices 51 and 52 arranged one behind the other. The devices 51 and 52, which are identical to each other, have the same construction in principle as that described with reference to Figures 1, 2 and 3. It will therefore suffice to indicate only the more important components of the wire gripping devices 51 and 52. Each of these devices comprises first and second wire guides which are constructed as sleeves 53 and 54, respectively. The sleeve 53 is disposed in a wall 55 and the sleeve 54 in the opposite wall 56.Both wire gripping devices 51 and 52 comprise two inclined walls 57 and 58, between which a chamber 59 extends. Two cylindrical rolling elements 60 and 61, two grippers 62 and 63, a pressure member 64 and a spring 65 are accommodated in the chamber 59. The grippers 62 and 63 partly extend into the sleeve 53 and in their sides which face on another are each formed with a channel like recess 49 which widens in a semi funnel like manner at the end which is nearer the sleeve 53. In this embodiment the angle a and angle ss 150. The wire gripping devices 51 and 52 are connected to slides 67 and 68 respectively, by bolts 66. The slides 67 and 68 are connected to the housing 50 by two pairs of leaf springs 69 and 70, respectively, made of stainless steel The leaf springs 69 and 70 are connected to the slides 67 and 73 by bolts 71 and to the housing 50 by bolts 72. The wire gripping devices 51 and 52 are so positioned relative to each other that the sleeves 53 and 54 of the two devices are coaxial with each other. The apparatus further comprises an electric motor unit 73 which is connected to the housing 50 by bolts 74. The motor unit 73 has a driving shaft 75 which is in an axial alignment with the sleeves 53 of the wiregripping devices 51 and 52. A shaft portion 76, the centre line of which intersects the centre line of the driving shaft 75 at an angle X of 2 , is fixed on the driving shaft 75. A bore 77 extends through the driving shaft 75 and the shaft portion 76. A wobble element 78 is journalled on the shaft portion 76 through bearing means comprising two pre stressed ball bearings 79 and 80, between which a ring 81 is provided. Of course, other types of bearings may alternatively be used, for example, angular contact bearings and sliding bearings.The bearings are sealed by a cover ring 82 which is held in place by a locking nut 83 screwed on the shaft portion 76. Two resiliently rods 84 and 85 of high speed steel connected at one end to the wobble element 78 at diametrically opposed points thereon and at the other end to the slides 67 and 68, respectively, constitute hinged joints between the wobble element 78 and the slides 67 and 68. The rods 84 and 85 are secured with a force fit in bores 86 and 87, respectively, in the wobble element 78 by means of a force fit. The rods 84 and 85 are similarly secured to connection elements 88 and 89, respectively which connection elements are received in axially extending bores 90 in the slides 67 and 68 and are fixed therein by bolts 91 which are screwed into the connection elements 88 and 89. In an end wall of the housing 50 opposite the wire gripping device 52 there is an aperture 92 through which the wire leaves the housing 50. This embodiment of the apparatus in accordance with the invention is suitable for feeding wires of different diameters between 0.8 and 1.6 mm without any alteration of the apparatus being necessary. At the angle gamma of 2 already mentioned, each wire gripping device 51 and 52 travels 1.5 mm in each forward movement and in each return movement. The speed of rotation of the driving shaft 75 will usually be in the range from 0 100 revolutions per second. In some welding processes, for example gas arc welding and submerged welding, welding wires having a larger diameter are used. The wire gripping devices can be appropriately dimensioned to handle such wires.
