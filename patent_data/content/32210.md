## Description
DESCRIPTION FLUORINATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS WITH FLUORINE IN POROUS METAL TUBE REACTOR WITH PERFLUORINATED DILUENT BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to the fluorination of organic compounds with elemental fluorine and particularly to the fluorination of organic compounds in a porous tube reactor wherein fluorine is fed onto one side of a porous member and the organic compound is fed onto the other side of the porous member, fluorine migrates through the porous member and fluorinated products are recovered from the other side of the porous member. The direct fluorination of organic compounds using elemental fluorine as a reactant, especially where the organic compound contains a carbon backbone of two or more atoms, has been considered impractical.Thus standard texts indicate the reaction R H X2 ÂµR X HX to be satisfactory only when X is Cl or Br and not whenX is F. Especially where R has more than one carbon, a substantial proportion of products having a different number of carbons than the reactants has been produced.Thus, for example, in the literature reports in volumes 61, 62 and 63 of the Journal of the American ChemicalSociety by L. A. Bigelow, yields with methane, ethane and acetone of CF4, C2F2 and CF3COCF3were, respectively, 30 50 , 30 40 and 10 . Intermediates and by products for methane included CH1 3F3 1 C2F6 and 8 Intermediates and byproducts for ethane included C2H1,5F 1 GH1,3F3,10 C2F6 and CF4 the latter resulting from cleavage of a carbon carbon bond . Intermediate and byproducts for acetone included CF4, COF2, CF3COF, COF 2 and CH3COCH2F. An invention of Bruce E. Kurtz, described inCanadian Patent 990,738 issued June 6, 1976 and also described in a somewhat different form in copending, commonly assigned U.S. Patent Application 644,788 filedDecember 29, 1975 now U.S. Patent 4,187,253, issuedFebruary 5, 1980 , includes the chlorination of one and two carbon hydrocarbons and their partially chlorinated derivatives in a porous tube reactor. In these references the porous tube is an elongated member, preferably of fritted Pyrex glass Pyrex being a registered trademark , but also permissibly of Alundum a registered trademark for a fixed alumina refractory material , a ceramic or a sintered metal, being in each case resistant to chlorine, anhydrous HC1, and the feed and product organic and chlorinated organic compounds. Two Japanese patents disclose the fluorination of organic compounds in a solvent with fluorine, using sulfur hexafluoride as a diluent for the fluorine. In Kokai 49000,201 January 5, 1974 Chemical Abstracts 80 95458n non polymeric organic compounds such as C6H6, toluene and uracil were used as reactants with the corresponding monofluorocompounds produced. In 49046281 December 9, 1974 Chemical Abstracts 82 1731689 carbon and fluorine in the presence of SF6 produced CF polymer and CF4 as a minor by product. Various processes have been proposed for electrochemical chlorination and fluorination of organic compounds. Organic compounds dissolved in or bubbled into anhydrous HF or molten fluoride salt HF combinations e.g. KF 2HF are subjected to an electrolytic voltage, forming elemental fluorine at the anode which fluorinates the product. U.S. Patents 2,841,544 and 3,298,940 describe such a process with a porous or foraminiferous anode, preferably made of carbon.In various Phillips Petroleum Company patents, the organic material is fed into the porous carbon anode and elemental fluorine passed from the electrolyte at the anode surface where it is formed into the porous carbon anode. Helium is sometimes used as a diluent. The present invention relates to the production of perfluoropropane or octafluoropropane which is known to be useful in plasma etching of electronic components and is a dielectric gas. The production of perfluoropropane has been attempted from a variety of starting materials, but no process has been developed which produces the material in high yields without a multitude of steps. Exemplary starting materials are propane, propene, hexafluoropropene and partially halogenated propanes and propenes. U.S. Patent 4,158,023 to von Halasz describes the production of perfluoropropane from hexafluoropropene in two steps. This reference indicates that the direct conversion with elemental fluorine results in poor yields. Since hexafluoropropene is itself fairly hard to produce in good yields, the overall process becomes involved with a multitude of steps and expense. U.S. Patent 3,840,445 to Paul et al. describes electrochemical fluorination of propane to perfluoropropane. The reference indicates the difficulty in separating propane from the product by distillation, and, accordingly, employs a two step process of electrochemical fluorination. Although the product need be separated only from partially fluorinated propane when the two steps are used, the process thereby becomes more involved, and the potential for overall yield losses increases. The production of perfluoropropane from propane by elemental fluorination in a jet reactor has been described in an article by A. F. Maxwell et al. inJournal of the American Chemical Society, Vol. 52, pp. 5827 30 November 20, 1960 . The tables in this article report production of perfluoropropane which suggests a yield, in the best case, of about 50 percent based on propane fed. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention includes a process of fluorinating acyclic organic compounds which comprises a passing fluorine as a first gaseous reactant into an elongated inner zone surrounded by a porous metal member which is substantially resistant to fluorine corrosion, and b introducing as a second gaseous re actant outside the porous metal member an organic compound having 2 4 carbons with at least one fluorinatable carbon selected from the group consisting of carbons covalently bonded to H, C1 or Br and carbons olefinically or acetylenically bonded to other carbons the pressure in said elongated inner zone being greater than the pressure outside the porous metal member at least one of said first and second gaseous reactants being admixed with a per fluorinated gaseous diluent selected from the group consisting of sulfur hexafluoride, tetrafluoromethane, hexafluoroethane and octafluoropropane. It has been discovered that the combination of a porous metal tube and the use of a perfluorinated diluent such as sulfur hexafluoride enables such fluorinations to occur with a maximum yield of perfluorinated products of like carbon number and a minimum degree of cleavage products with lesser carbon numbers. A preferred class of organic compounds are those with three carbons, such as propane, propene or hexafluoropropene, with the product octafluoropropane being recovered from the effluent outside the porous member. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention employs a porous metal tube for the elemental fluorination of organic compounds.When using such a tube for fluorination, unlike the fluorinations described in Canadian Patent 990,738 andU.S. Patent 4,187,253, it is not sufficient to employ common inert diluents such as nitrogen and achieve good yields with low losses to cleavage reactions or carbon formation. Instead it has been found that a perfluorinated diluent such as sulfur hexafluoride is required.Other perfluorinated diluents such as CF4, C2F2 or C3F8, which may also be the reaction product, may be employed in place of sulfur hexafluoride. Alternatively, HF, the reaction byproduct, may be used as a diluent. SF6 is preferred. The organic compound used as a second gaseous reactant shall have at least two carbons, at least one of which is Wfluorinatably, by which is meant having an H, C1 or Br attached that can be replaced by F or an olefinic or acetylenic bond to another carbon that can be added across by fluorine. Acyclic and cycloaliphatic compounds are preferred over aromatic compounds. Compounds having at least one C fl bond are preferred over compounds having only fluorinatable carbons other than carbons bonded to hydrogen. While carbons bonded to hetero atoms such as Br, C1 or 0 are eventually fluorinated, the present process can also be made selective by using limited amounts of fluorine and or mild conditions so as to preserve hetero atoms and replace only hydrogens and unsaturations by fluorine. One preferred group of second reactants are the aliphatic hydrocarbons of at least two carbons, including aliphatic hydrocarbons such as ethane, propane, butane and higher members of the series and olefinic hydrocarbons such as ethene, propene, butene and higher members of the series. Eight carbons is the highest preferred size of the hydrocarbons. These materials can be converted to the corresponding perfluoroalkanes of the formula CnFZn 2, or less fluorinated members having unsaturations or hydrogens, and less than 2n 2 F s. Propane and propene are two preferred reactants in this group. Another preferred group of second reactants are partially halogenated compounds of the above group having some or all of the hydrogens or unsaturations replaced by C1, Br or F, but not all by F. Only hydrogens and unsaturations of such reactants are replaced by fluorine under mild conditions, especially temperature, and when the amount of fluorine is limited to that required for the desired fluorination. Thus C2H5C1 can be converted to C2ClF5 with low temperatures and only five moles of fluorine per C2H5C1 or it can be converted to C2F5 with six or more moles of fluorine per C2H6C1.Hexafluoropropene is a preferred reactant in this group. Another preferred group of reactants are the ketones of 3 8 carbons such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone and higher members of the series, together with partially halogenated ketones, as described above. In general hydrogens will first be replaced by fluorine, then Br, than C1 and only then the carbonyl oxygen.Preferred is acetone and partially halogenated acetone. Another preferred group of second gaseous reactants are the cyclized form of any of the above such as cyclopentane, cyclohexane, and cyclohexene. In general, aromatics are not preferred since they are more likely to result in byproducts which can clog the pores of the porous tube. Either the first or second gaseous reactant can be mixed with the perfluorinated diluent, such as sulfur hexafluoride. Preferably, both reactants are mixed with sulfur hexafluoride. The mole ratio of fluorine to sulfur hexafluoride admixed therewith is preferably between about 2 1 and about 1 12, more preferably between 1 5 and about 1 10. The mole ratio of second gaseous reactant to sulfur hexafluoride admixed therewith is preferably between about 4 1 and about 1 5, more preferably between about 1 1.5 and about 1 3. The ratio of fluorine to three carbon compound depends, in part, upon the particular three carbon compound employed. Thus, in general, one can compute the stoichiometric amount of fluorine required to convert the entire second reactant to a perfluoropropane as a first estimate of the desired amount of fluorine to be introduced. For three carbon compounds having a hydrogen, one mole of fluorine is required for each mole of hydrogen bonded to carbon such that half of the fluorine molecule can replace the hydrogen to form a C F bond and the other half of the fluorine molecule can form HF byproduct. For each unsaturation, one mole of fluorine is required to add across a double bond and to form two C F bonds. For each other halogen present such as C1 or Br, or any other hetero atom present, one molecule of fluorine is generally required to both replace the hetero atom and form a by product between fluorine and the hetero atom. In general, however, hetero atoms are preferably not present such that the three carbon compound has no elements other than carbon, hydrogen and fluorine. While any amount of fluorine may be used, it is preferred to use between 50 and 150 percent of the stoichiometric amount. Thus, in the case of propane, 8 moles of fluorine per propane constitutes the stoichiometric amount, and a generally suitable range of fluorine is between about 4 and about 12 moles of fluorine per propane. Preferably, between about 5 and about 10 moles of fluorine are introduced into the inner zone per mole of propane introduced outside the elongated porous member. More preferably between about 8 and about 9.5 moles of fluorine are introduced per mole of fluorine. In the case of propene, the stoichiometric amount is 7 moles of fluorine per propene. A generally suitable overall range is between about 3.5 and about 10.5 moles of fluorine per mole of propene. A preferred range of fluorine to propene ratios is between about 4 1 and about 8 1, more preferably between about 7 1 and about 8 1. In the case of hexafluoropropene, the stoichiometric mole ratio is 1 1 while a range of about 0.5 1 to about 1.5 1 is suitable, as well as amounts higher, and especially lower in fluorine than that range, the preferred ratios are between about 0.7 1 and about 1.1 1, especially about 1 1. The porous tube used in the present invention can be any metal inert to corrosion by fluorine under the relatively mild reaction conditions employed. Preferably the pore size is between about 0.5 and about 50 micrometers, taken as an average of all pores or as a limitation on substantially each and every pore. Where propane is the reactant, octafluoropropane can be recovered from the effluent by condensing the effluent under sufficiently high pressure and low temperature to condense octafluoropropane, separating the condensate from the uncondensed portion of the effluent, separating an organic phase of the condensate from a hydrogen fluoride phase of the condensate and recovering octafluoropropane from the organic phase of the condensate. The preferred method of recovering octafluoropropane from the organic phase of the condensate is by fractional distillation since, once phase separation has occurred, no compounds boiling close to octafluoropropane will remain in the condensate.It should be appreciated that, if propane itself were present in the effluent, it would also be found in the organic phase of the condensate and would, according to U.S. Patent 3,840,445 complicate purification. In the examples described below having a stoichiometric excess of fluorine, no propane was detected in the effluent and no difficulty should be encountered in separating perfluoropropane from other materials by fractional distillation. Example 1 Fluorination of Ethane Fluorine gas 0.1 mol h admixed with sulfur hexafluoride 0.50 mol h was introduced at 101.4 kPa pressure into the bottom of a 6 inch 15.2 cm long, 1.5 inch diameter Inconel porous tube of wall thickness 0.065 inch .165 cm thickness and 10 micrometer pore size Inconel being a registered trademark for a nickel ironchromium alloy . The tube was sealed at the top. Ethane 0.40 mol h was introduced at a pressure of 101.4 kPa into a 1 2 inch 1.27 cm by six inch 15.3 cm annular zone outside the porous tube and inside a concentric impervious stainless steel tube 2 inches 5.08 cm in diameter. Gaseous effluent was reiaoved from the top of the annular zone. Thus total feeds were 0,10 mol h F2, 0.40 mol h of C H and 0.50 mol h of SF6.The temperature was monitored by a thermowell along the outside of the porous tube and showed a maximum of 760C at a calculated contact time of 20 seconds. On line gas chromatographic analysis of the effluent, after passing through a sodium fluoride bed to absorb the HF, showed about .013 mol h C2F6 80 yield based on F2 feed , about .005 mol h CF4 20 yield based on F2 feed and no partially fluorinated ethanes such as C2 HF5 or C2H5F. A similar experiment using nitrogen as the diluent produced only CF4, the cleavage product, and no measurable C2F6. In this experiment the maximum temperature sensed by the thermowell was 750C. Even when the reaction temperature was lowered to 500C by a cooling bath only CF4 was observed in the effluent. Those two runs are described in more detail as ComparativeExamples 15 and 16, below. Examples 2 4 Fluorination of Propane and Propene Example 1 was repeated using the same tube, but now feeding 0.25 or 0.50 mol h of F2 admixed with 2.0 mol h of SF6 into the bottom of the porous tube and 0.25 mol h of propane or propene admixed with 0.50 mol h of SF6into the annular zone, all as shown in Table 1.On line gas chromatographic analysis of the vaporized effluent gave the area percentages shown in Table 1.

This reaction was continued for ten hours with the effluent passing through an NaF scrubber to remove HF by absorption and then trapped in condenser traps at 800C and 1960C.The temperature profile measured by the thermowell along the surface of the porous tube under steady state conditions was 1170C at the base, 1390C two inches 5 cm from the base, 141 C four inches 10 cm above the base and 1250C at the top of the tube six inches 15 cm above the base. The thermowell measured 730C two inches 5 cm above the upper end of the porous tube. The trapped materials were combined into one cylinder which contained 100 g of water. The purpose of the water was to complex the fluoroacetones as their hydrates which could then be isolated by distillation.After venting off the more volatile SF6, the recovered aqueous organic mixture which was composed of unreacted acetone, H2O and fluoroacetone hydrates was distilled.The comparative results of distillation and gas chromatographic analysis of the aqueous organic mixture expressed as the anhydrous products are shown in Table 2.

Examples 6 12 Fluorination of Acetone With Different Porous Tubes Example 5 was repeated for shorter runs with the effluent analyzed by on line gas chromatography. In Examples 6 8 a porous stainless steel SS tube with 0.5 micrometer pore size was used. In Examples 9 11 a porous nickel N tube with 5 micrometer pore size was used. Both tubes have substantially the same external dimensions and thickness as the Inconel I tube used in Examples 1 5 and also in Example 12. The feed rates into the inner zone IZ and annular zone AZ , contact times, maximum temperature measured by the thermowell and product analyses by area normalized to exclude unreacted acetone and sulfur hexafluoride are all shown in Table 3. Also shown is the HF in the effluent as a percentage of the theoretical value obtained by assuming that each fluorine molecule fed was involved in the stoichiometry R H F2EMI11.1 R F HF.

Examples 6, 9 and 12 represent the more preferred modes of the invention where the fluorine to sulfur hexafluoride molar ratio fed to the inner zone is between about 1 5 and about 1 10 1 5.5, 1 7.7 and 1 8 respectively . Examples 7, 10 and 11 have slightly less preferred molar ratios of fluorine to sulfur hexafluoride 1 3.3, 1 4.2 and 1 4.2 respectively which is still within the broader range of between about 2 1 and about 1 12. Comparative Examples 13 and 14 Fluorination of Methanes Using an Inconel porous tube with 10 micrometer pore size, and otherwise the same apparatus as inExample 1, methane was fluorinated using nitrogen as the diluent. CF4, but no partially fluorinated methanes were observed in the effluent by on line gas chromatography.In Comparative Example 13 the total feeds were 0.5 mol h of fluorine, 0.45 mol h of methane and 0.5 mol h of nitrogen. The respective feeds in Comparative Example 14 were 0.1, 0.4 and 0.5 mol h. The maximum temperatures observed by the thermowell were 520C and 690C, respectively. Calculated yields were 88 and 84 tetrafluoroethane, respectively. This comparative example indicates that if one were to apply the teachings of CanadianPatent 990,738 directly to fluorination of methane, reactivity would be observed with a conventional nitrogen diluent. Comparative Examples 15 and 16 Fluorination of Ethane Several attempts were made to fluorinate ethane with fluorine using nitrogen as the diluent. Two such examples are described herein. Using the Inconel porous tube described above, 0.5 mol h of ethane was fed into the outer zone of the reactor and 0.1 mol h of F2 diluted with 0.5 mol h of nitrogen was fed into the annular zone. Maximum temperature observed was 740 C. Gas chromatographic analysis of effluent showed no C2F6 but essentially all CF4. The yield of the latter agreed with F2 introduced. The experiment was repeated except that the reaction was immersed in a cooling bath to give an internal temperature of about 50 . The results were the same as the preceding. Comparative Example 17 An attempt was made to fluorinate acetone with fluorine, diluting each with sulfur hexafluoride, in a pipe reactor. A cylindrical stainless steel pipe one inch 2.5 cm inside diameter by 12 inch 30 cm length was packed with 27.5 g copper mesh. Streams of 0.07 mol h of fluorine diluted with 0.5 mol h of sulfur hexafluoride and 0.25 mol h of acetone diluted with 0.61 mol h of sulfur hexafluoride were fed into the bottom end and the effluent from the top end was analyzed by on line gas chromatography. The maximum temperature sensed by a thermowell along the center of the reactor was 1000C. Partially fluorinated acetones, but noCF3COCF3 and no CF4 were detected in the effluent. Comparative Example 18 When Comparative Example 17 was repeated at higher flow rates of fluorine and consequently higher temperatures, increasing amounts of both CF3COCF3 andCF4 were observed. Several runs are plotted in Table 4.This example shows that, while some benefits can be achieved by using SF6 as a diluent in a pipe tube reactor, higher amounts of cleavage products are obtained compared to CF3COCF3 than in the porous tube reactor process employed in Examples 5 12.
