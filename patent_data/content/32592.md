# Method and apparatus for real time detection of faults in industrial objects.

## Abstract
Method and apparatus for the detection of faults in industrial objects 3 and signalling such faults fo handling apparatuses 3 . According to the invention, the image is taken of a sample object by a television camera 2 or other sensing device the image is digitized and stores in a frame memory 6 . The digitized sample image is then divided into small areas, for each of which the square root of standard deviation σ for the luminance levels of dots belonging of each area is calculated and stored. The same operations and elaborations are followed for each object 3 to be checked and the obtained σ values are com pared with those of the sample. When the differences thereof are above predetermined thresholds, an output signal is generated for distinguishing the fault and gen erally the faulty object and for controlling a handling appa ratus 3 for the objects 3 .
