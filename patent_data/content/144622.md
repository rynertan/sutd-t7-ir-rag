# Apparatus and method for injection molding lenses.

## Abstract
An apparatus and method for molding polycarbonate lenses is disclosed in which the lenses are formed in a single injection molding operation. Polycarbonate is injected into a cavity 86 between two movable dies 59, 60 which are forced apart by the injected polycarbonate. These dies 59, 60 are then urged together forcing a portion of the injected polycarbonate back through the same port through which the polycarbonate was injected. The finished lens does not have the knit line normally associated with injection molded lenses.
