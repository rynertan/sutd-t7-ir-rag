## Description
NEW CHROMANONE COMPOUNDS AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM The present invention is concerned with chromanone compounds and pharmaceutical compositions containing them. Although compounds such as salicylates, anthranilic acid derivatives, phenylacetic acid derivatives, indolylacetic acid derivatives and pyrazolones have been used conventionally as drugs having antipyretic, analgesic and antiinflammatory actions, they have given rise to troubles due to side effects such as gastro intestinal, hepatorenal and hematological disorders. Alleviation of these adverse effects has been attempted by improving dosage forms and by chemical modification, or more recently by other methods, e.g. the use of pro drugs. The present invention results from investigations for developing drugs comparable or superior to conventional non steroid drugs in effectiveness, and without the above mentioned side effects. As a result of these investigations, some new chromanone compounds were discovered, and certain of these compounds were found to have antiiflammatory and antipyretic analgesic actions, as well as low toxicity, thus showing pharmaceutical utility. The present invention provides compounds represented by the following general formula I EMI1.1 or are pharmaceutically acceptable salts of such compounds. In Formula I , each of R1, R2, R4 and R5 is a hydrogen atom or lower alkyl group, orR4 and R5, together with the carbon atom to which they are attached, form a ring having 3 to 6 mernbersy R3 is a hydrogen or halogen atom, n is 0 or 1. The invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions containing one or more such compounds as active ingredient. Values of R1 and R2, in addition to hydrogen include straight or branched lower alkyl groups preferably having 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, iso butyl, sec butyl and t butyl.The lower alkyl groups may contain up to 5 or even 6 carbon atoms. Values or R3 include hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine. Values of R4 and R5 include those mentioned above for R1 and R2 In addition, R4 and R5 may optionally together form 3 to 6 membered ring cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl . When optical isomers exist in the compounds of the present invention, the invention includes dl , 1 and d isomers. The preferred pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula I are those with alkali metals such as sodium, potassium and lithium, with alkaline earth metals such as calcium and magnesium, with other metals such as aluminium, with ammonium, and with organic amines such as trimethylamine, triethylamine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, morpholine, pyridine and picoline. In accordance with the present invention, the new compounds are prepared as follows, the variables being as defined above A compound represented by the general formula II EMI2.1 in which Ra is a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group or CHR2 COOR1 andRb is a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group is reacted with a compound represented by the general formula III or an active derivative thereof EMI2.2 to give a compound represented by the general formula IV EMI3.1 and compound IV is converted to a compound represented by the general formula I by ring closure with acid. To carry out the reaction, the compound represented by the general formula IV may be obtained by Friedel Crafts reaction with anhydrous aluminium chloride in an inert solvent such as carbon disulphide, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride or methylene chloride. Then the compound IV is heated with strong acid such as polyphosphoric acid, concentrated hydrochloric acid or concentrated sulphuric acid at an appropriate temperature to yield by ring closure the intended compound. It furthermore is not always necessary to separate the compound of formula IV . The compounds represented by the general formulae II and III and the above mentioned acid catalyst may be reacted together simultaneously to give a compound of the present invention in one step. Alternatively, a compound of formula II above is reacted with a compound represented by the general formula V in the same way as with the first processEMI3.2 in which each of Xl and X2 indicates a halogen atom to give a compound represented by the general formula VI EMI3.3 which is then converted to a compound of the present invention by ring closure. To carry out the ring closure reaction, the compound VI is allowed to stand at room temperature or at an appropriate temperature in the presence of an alkali metal carbonate such as potassium carbonate, optionally with reaction accelerating agent such as potassium iodide, in an inert solvent such as dimethylformamide. In another method, a compound represented by the general formula II in which Rb H is reacted with epropiolactone in the presence of base such as sodium hydroxide with heating at an appropriate temperature to give a compound represented by the general formula VII EMI4.1 and the compound VII is then converted by ring closure in the same way as in the first process to give a compound represented by the general formula I in which R4 R5 H. Yet another method involves reacting a compound represented by the general formula II , in which Rb H with a compound represented by the general formula VIII EMI4.2 in which X3 indicates a halogen atom, followed by ring closure with heating and reduction to give a compound represented by the general formula IX ref. Japanese patent application No. Sho 56 126912 EMI4.3 The resultant compound is then oxidized to give a compound of the present invention. Potassium permanganate, lead tetraacetate or chromic anhydride may be used as oxidizing reagent. In all the above mentioned reactions, when a compound represented by the general formula II in which Ra is a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group is used, Ra can be treated in the usual way to give a compound of the present invention either during the synthesis or after. For example, when Ra is a hydrogen atom, the compound II is acylated by Friedel Crafts reaction and then treatment of the acyl group with thallium III nitrate, which results in oxidative rearrangement to give a group CHR2 COOR1 according to the method of Taylor Journal ofSynthetic Organic Chemistry, Japan, 36, 875 1978 . When Ra is a lower alkyl group, the compound II may be halogenated with a halogenating reagent such as N bromosuccinimide, and then converted to a nitrile with cyanating reagent such as sodium cyanide, potassium cyanide, followed by hydrolysis in the usual way to give the compound of the present invention. In accordance with the above mentioned processes, the compound of the present invention is obtained, in the form of free carboxylic acid or ester. Furthermore, it may be converted to another compound of the present invention by esterification or hydrolysis in the usual way. For example, free carboxylic acids of the present invention may be rected with an alcohol corresponding to the intended R1 in the presence of an acid such as sulphuric acid, gaseous hydrogen chloride, hydrochloric acid, p toluenesulphonic acid, camphorsulphonic acid or thionyl chloride to give ester derivatives of the present invention. The hydrolysis may be carried out in water, an organic solvent such as a lower alcohol, or mixture of them, in the presence of a base such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate or potassium bicarbonate, or an acid catalyst such as hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, acetic acid or p toluenesulphonic acid. In the case of benzyl ester derivatives, the ester residue may be removed by reduction, e.g. with hydrogen over a palladium on carbon catalyst. The compounds of the present invention also may be converted to their salts, if desired, in the usual ways. The compounds of the present invention can be purified by usual methods such as distillation, chromatography and recrystallization, and the products can be identified by such methods as elemental analysis, melting point and IR, NMR, UV and mass spectra.
