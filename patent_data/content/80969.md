# A method of removing residual acrylonitrile from latex systems.

## Abstract
Acrylonitrile is a monomer that is widely used in the production of a vast variety of polymers. Undesirable quantities of residual unpolymerized acrylonitrile are often present in polymers. The residual or free acrylonitrile in polymers can be reacted with certain thiols in order to reduce their content in the polymer. In the reaction between these thiols and acrylonitrile products are formed which exhibit antioxidant ability.
