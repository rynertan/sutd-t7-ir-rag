## Description
APPARATUS FOR MONITORING CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT SURFACE MOVEMENTS IN LIVING ORGANISMS This invention relates to apparatus for monitoring clinically significant surface movements in living organisms, especially humans. Various types of apparatus are known for measuring surface movements on living organisms, including human subjects. However, heretofore such apparatus has not measured body surface movements by measuring changes in the inductance of a loop disposed on the surface to be monitored. Furthermore, whilst there are known techniques for measuring intrapleural pressure, none of these techniques measure iIltL d pleural pressure by monitoring movements of the skin surface of the suprasternal fossa. It is known that a change in cross sectional area of a conductive loop causes a proportional change in the inductance of the loop. This property has been utilized to monitor variations in a patients chest and abdomen areas by measuring the inductance of an extensible electrical conductor closely looped around the body and hence monitor respiration volimis of the subject. This method and apparatus therefor are disclosed in United States Patent Specification No. 4 308 872. Heretofor it has not been appreciated that by monitoring the inductance and hence the change in area of smaller conductive loops placed upon an area of the body which is subject to surface movement, clinically significant data may be obtained. According to the present invention there is provided apparatus for detecting movement of an external or internal surface portion of a living organism for measuring a parameter of said living organism related to said movement, comprising a conductive loop dimensioned and adapted for disposition on said external or internal surface portion, and means connected to said loop for generating a signal indicative of the inductance of said loop, changes in said signal being indicative of the extent of movement of said surface portion. The apparatus of the invention employs a length of preferably insulated conductive wire formed in the shape of a loop. The loop is secured to the organism such that at least a portion of the loop lies on the surface being monitored and moves therewith. Movement of the surface portion being monitored results in proportional movement of the part of the loop lying thereon and hence proportional changes in the cross sectional area of the loop. This, in turn, caused a proportional change in the inductance of the loop.Accordingy, by measuring the changes in the inductance of the loop, the extent of surface movement may be determined. To measure inductance, the conductive loop is preferably incorporated as the inductance element in a variable frequency LC oscillator. Consequently, changes in the loop inductance result in proportional changes in the signal frequency at the output of the oscillator. The variable frequency output signal from the oscillator may then be converted to a corresponding voltage signal suitable for display on a CRT, strip chart recorder, or other suitable output device. One particularly significant application of the present invention is measuring intrapleural pressure in human subjects. In this application, one part of the conductive loop is secured to the skin surface of the suprasternal fossa, and the remainder of the loop Is preferably secured to the skin surface above the manubrium of the sternum. The skin surface of the suprasternal fossa moves in and out as the subject exhales and inhales, whereas the skin surface of the manubrium is relatively free of movement. The loop is connected to suitable circuitry, such as that mentioned above, for monitoring changes in the inductance of the loop.By comparing changes in the inductance of the loop with intrapleural pressure as measured with an esophageal balloon catheter, I have found that at zero flow, i.e. at end expiration and end inspiration, movements of the skin surface of the suprasternal fossa are proportional to changes in intrapleural pressure. Consequently, monitoring changes in the inductance of the loop, which are proportional to these movements, provides a signal proportional to intrapleural pressure. Zero flow points may be determined from simultaneous tidal volume measurements from, e.g. a spirometer. Furthermore, this signal may be calibrated during an initial calibration procedure by comparing the output signal from the conductive loop at zero flow with intrapleural pressure as measured by an alternative invasive technique, such as the esophageal balloon catheter or preferably a null technique to be described hereinafter.Once calibrated, the output signal yields actual intrapleural pressure on a non invasive basis, provided the subject is relatively immobile. Numerous other applications of the apparatus in accordance with the present invention, some of which will be discussed hereinafter, will suggest themselves to those skilled in the art once this description is known. The apparatus in accordance with the present invention will be more fully apparent from the following detailed description and annexed drawings of the presently preferred embodiment thereof.

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION Referring now to the drawings, and initially toFIG. 2, the preferred apparatus in accordance with the present invention is generally designated by the reference numeral 10. As shown, the apparatus 10 includes a preferably insulated length of conductive wire 12 formed in the shape of a loop. It is known that the inductance of a conductive loop is proportional to the cross sectional area enclosed by the loop. Accordingly, a change in the cross sectional area enclosed by the loop causes a proportional change in the loop inductance. To apply this technology to monitoring surface movements on living organisms, such as human subjects, the conductive loop is disposed on the subject such that at least a portion of the loop lies on the surface portion being monitored. The loop may be secured in place as by taping, or by employing an adhesive preparation such as a collodion solution, although care should be taken not to inhibit movement of the loop upon movement of the surface portion being monitored. Movement of the surface portion being monitored causes the loop portion above the moving surface to move.This, in turn, causes a change in the cross sectional area enclosed by the loop and hence in the inductance of the loop. By monitoring these inductance changes in the manner more fully explained below, an indication of the extent of surface movement is provided. Referring to FIGS. 2 and 3, the preferred circuitry for converting the inductance of the loop 12 to a suitable electrical signal is diagrammatically illustrated. As shown, the circuit includes a variable frequency LC oscillator circuit 14 connected to the ends of the conductive loop 12. The resonant frequency of the oscillator circuit 14 is determined by an internal cdpacitor and the inductance of the conductive loop 12. This frequency may, for example, be centered about 400,000Hz, and will vary as the cross sectional area e,.c osed by the loop varies. Because the surface movements being measured are often quite small, it is essential that the oscillator circuit have sufficient sensitivity and gain to measure these movements. A schematic representation of a suitable oscillator circuit 14 is shown in FIG. 4.Construction and operation of the oscillator circuit 14 of FIG. 4 will be apparent to those skilled in the art once this description is known. To minimize interference during subsequent signal transmission, and as shown, the oscillator circuit 14 preferably includes an output resistor R10 for converting the oscillator output signal to a current signal. The output signal from the oscillator circuit 14 is preferably converted to a suitable voltage signal by a demodulator circuit 18. The output of the demodulator circuit 18 is an analog voltage signal having an amplitude which varies in response to variations in the frequency of the oscillator circuit 14. Preferably, the demodulating circuit 18 is digital, the preferred circuitry being diagrammatically illustrated in FIG. 3 The construction and operation of the circuit of FIG. 3 will be apparent to those skilled in the art once this description is known.The analog output signal is provided by a conventional digital to analog converter, and may be displayed on one or more suitable output devices, shown by way of example in FIG. 2 as a CRT terminal 23 and a strip chart recorder 25. Referring now to FIG. 1 in the drawings, use of the apparatus of the present invention will now be described in connection with a particularly significant application measurement of intrapleural pressure.Intrapleural pressure, as well as parameters derivable therefrom, is important in the diagnosis of diseased and abnormal lungs. In human subjects, the obvious technique for measuring intrapleural pressure by passing a needle through the chest wall into the pleural space is too dangerous. Instead, the currently accepted technique is to have the subject swallow an esophageal balloon catheter.Because the esophagus is contiguous with the pleural space, the pressure within the balloon reflects intrapleural pressure. This technique, however, is invasive and hence uncomfortable. To non invasively measure intrapleural pressure in accordance with the invention, the conductive loop 12 is secured on the subject 24 such that one portion of the wire lies on the skin surface of the suprsternal fossa and the other portion of the wire lies on the skin surface of the manubrium of the sternum. Typically, and as shown inFIG. 1, the loop 12 is more or less elliptically shaped and has a circumference of approximately twelve centimeters. The major axis of the ellipse is approximately six centimeters, whereas the minor axis is approximately one and a half to two centimeters. The surface of the suprasternal fossa moves in response to changes in intrapleural pressure, whereas the skin surface of the manubrium is relatively free of movement.Alternatively, the entire loop 12 could be secured to skin surface of the suprasternal fossa, the basic criterion being to insure that movement of that surface causes a change in the cross sectional area enclosed by the loop. To minimize artifacts, and as shown in FIG. 1, the oscillator circuit 14 is preferably incorporated in a module 26 secured to the subject 24 in the vicinity of the loop 12. preferably, both the loop 12 and oscillator m.od ule 26 are secured to the subject 24 by tape 28. When taping the loop 12, care should be taken not to inhibit the loop from moving in response to movement of the skin surface of the suprasternal fossa. To this end, a strip of tape 28 in the unstressed shape of loop 12 is used for securing the loop to the subject 24. As shown, a piece of gauze 29 preferably overlies the module 26, and the tape 28 is applied to the gauze for securing the module 26 in place. A pair of insulated wire leads 20 join the oscillator circuit module 26 to the loop 12, the leads 20 preferably being joined together in the vicinity of the loop. Connectors 22 in the wire leads 20 may be employed to accommodate separation of the loop 12 from the oscillator circuit module 26. It will be apparent that the inductance element of the oscillator 14 is determined not only by the loop 12 but also by the leads 20, and that movement of the leads 20 would therefore be disadvantageous as it would affect the oscillation frequency of the oscillator 14. Accordingly, the leads 20 are preferably substantially rigid, or secured against movement in some other fashion. The leads 20 in FIG. 1 are rendered rigid by the combination of the substantially rigid wire sheaths 27 and connectors 22.A cable 30 extending from the module 26 connects the oscillator circuit 14 to the de odu lating circuit 18 and connected output devices 23 and 25. the subject exhales and inhales, the changes in intrapleural pressure cause in and out movement of the skin surface of the suprasternal fossa. In accordance with the invention, movement of the skin surface of the suprasternal fossa results in changes in the cross sectional area enclosed by the loop l2 and hence the inductance of the loop, as the portion of the loop on the suprasternal fossa moves relative to the remainder of the loop.As is more fully explained above, changes in the loop inductance are monitored by the oscillator circuitry 14 and demodulating circuit 18, and displayed on the CRT 23 and or strip chart recorder 25 Ccnse uentIy, the voltage signal as displayed on the CRT 23 or recorded on the strip chart recorder 25 is indicative of the extent of movement of the skin surface of the suprasternal fossa By comparing this signal with intrapleural pressure as measured by an esophageal balloon catheter, I have found that at zero flow t.e. at end inspiration and end expiration, there is a linear relationship between intrapleural pressure and movement of the surface of the suprasternal fossa.This is illustrated in FIG. 5 wherein intrapleural pressure as measured with an esophageal balloon catheter is plotted vs. the signal amplitude recorded on the strip chart recorder 25 for a single subject at various tidal volumes with a respiration rate in the range of approximately 15 20 breaths per minute. The graph illustrates a linear relationship as exemplified by the line 32 approximating the plotted points. The plotted points in FIG. 5 were recorded at zero flow, which was determined by simultaneous recordings on a spirometer. Alternatively, zero flow points may be non invasively determined from the respiration volume signal recorded on an apparatus of the type disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 4,308,872, entitled Method and Apparatus For Monitoring Respiration, the contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. By employing alternative techniques for monitoring intrapleural pressure, the output signal from the apparatus 10 may be calibrated during an initial calibration procedure, whereby subsequent readings will indicate actual intrapleural pressure at zero flow rates. For example, the output signal from the demodulating circuit 18 may be calibrated by comparison with intrapleural pressure measurements as simultaneously recorded with an esophageal balloon catheter. In another calibration technique, the subject is fitted with a mouthpiece which accommodates unencumbered inspiration, but interrupts flow completely upon expiration. The output signal from the apparatus 10 is first observed at the end expiratory level, which may be determined from simultaneous measurements taken with a spirometer. This level is indicated at the point 34 on the graph of FIG. 6B.The subject is then instructed to first inspire, and then expire.During expiration, the mouth pressure is recorded from a pressure tap in the mouthpiece. The mouth pressure required during expiration to return the output signal from the system 10 to the previous end expiratory level is then equivalent to intrapleural pressure. This is designated the null technique . Thus, and referring to FIG.6B, calibration is effected by equating the output signal change over the interval from peak inspiration at time t back to end expiratory level at time t2 with the mouth pressure change over the same interval. The sdlile techni que is iliustrated in FIG. 6A for a smaller tidal volume It should be noted that the resulting calibration is only effective with relatively immobile subjects, and that movement of the head or neck affects the accuracy of the calibrated signal. Once the apparatus 10 is calibrated for a particular subject 24, that subject s lung compliance CL may be determined. Lung compliance is defined by the rela AV tionship t p where t V is the change in tidal volume over a given time interval, and tP is the change in intrapleural pressure over the same interval. With the system 10 calibrated, t P at zero flow rates is readily determined. AV may be determined by employing a spirometer, or the non invasive system disclosed in U.S. Patent No. .4,308,872, the contents of which have already been incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.Lung compliance is clinically useful as it has been observed that lung compliance is reduced in patients with pulmonary congestion, edema, fibrosis, and is elevated during asthmatic attacks and in emphysema. By recording lung compliance at various breathing frequencies the dependence of lung compliance on breath frequency, i.e. dynamic lung compliance, may be calculated. This is illustrated inFIG. 7, wherein lung compliance at zero flow for both normal and lung diseased patients is recorded at respiration rates of 15, 20, 30, 40, 45 and 60 breaths per minute. Also plotted on FIG. 7 is dynamic lung compliance as simultenously recorded with an esophageal balloon catheter. The close correlation is apparent. The accuracy of dynamic lung compliance readings recorded with the surface inductive plethysmograph of the invention is further apparent from the line approximations 36 in FIGS. 8 and 9 wherein lung compliance for a plurality of subjects at varying breath rates based on intrapleural pressure measurements from the apparatus 10 is plotted vs. lung compliance based on simultaneous intrapleural pressure measurements taken with an esophageal balloon catheter. The data for FIG. 8 was recorded from normal patients, whereas the FIG. 9 data was recorded from patients with lung disease.Dynamic lung compliance is clinically significant as it has been observed that lung compliance decreases with increasing breath frequency when the smaller airways of the lungs are obstructed such as occurs during early lung disease in smokers. The system 10 may also be utilized to calculate static lung compliance. This is accomplished by recording lung compliance for a subject at different tidal volumes for a substantially zero respiration rate.Because intrapleural pressure and tidal volume are not truly linearly related with increasing tidal volumes, it is desirable to determine intrapleural pressure for each different tidal volume by mouth pressure measurements in accordance with the technique more fully described above.Tidal volume, L, vs. mouth pressure, PM intrapleural pressure for increasing tidal volumes for a subject in the seated and supine positions is plotted in FIG. 10. As may be seen from FIG. 10, this technique yields consistent results for both positions. This is especially significant as intrapleural pressure mesurements recorded with an esophageal balloon catheter tend to be inaccurate in the supine position. I have also found that intrapleural pressure as measured in accordance with the present invention is accurately reflected even during elastic and non elastIc loading of the respiratory system. This is illustrated in the case of elastic loading by the graph of FIG. 11. InFIG. 11, tidal volume as recorded by the apparatus disclosed in said U.S. Patent No. 4,308,872, mouth pressure, intrapleural pressure as recorded with an esophageal balloon catheter, and intrapleural pressure as recorded by the apparatus 10 of the present invention are all plotted vs. time for a particular subject.The subject is initially breathing normally, and it may be seen that during this interval that1 intrapleural pressure as recorded with the apparatus 10 parallels intrapleural pressure changes as recorded with an esophageal balloon catheter. At time tl, the subject s respiratory tract is elastically aoRded by having the subject breathe against a closed volume. This is indicated by both a decrease in tidal volume, and a gradual increase in mouth pressure over the interval that2. During the interval tl t2, it may be seen that intrapleural pressure as measured with the apparatus 10 of the present invention still parallels intrapleural pressure as measured with the esophageal balloon catheter. Even if the apparatus 10 of the present invention is not calibrated, the qualitative signal at the output of the demodulating circuit 18 is still useful.For example, obstructive apnea is characterized by increased negative intrapleural pressures, which may be qualitatively determined when monitoring is effected on a long term basis. Tn this regard, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the microprocessor illustrated in FIG. 3 may be programmed to detect amplitude and or frequency variations and to provide an alarm signal upon detection of particular conditions, such as apnea. The apparatus of the present invention has numerous applications apart from measuring intrapleural pressure. In fact, the present invention may be employed to monitor any movement of one surface portion of a living oranism relative to another portion. For example, it may be used to monitor the activity of the accessory muscles of respiration, ibich are located on either side of the suprasternal space. To do so, one portion of the loop 12 is disposed on the skin surface over the sternomastoid muscle. As the muscle contracts and relaxes the loop is spread apart and narrowed, respectively, such that mechanical activity of the muscle is detected.As these muscles are only minimally active during normal breathing at rest, but exhibit increased contraction with rapid breathing, airway obstruction, and increased respiratory center output, the detection of their activity is clinically useful. Further, this technique is free of electrical artifacts that can occur when activity is monitored indirectly as with the moving time window average of surface electromyography. Still other possible applications of the apparatus of the present invention include, but are not limited to, measuring movement of hinge joints flaring of the nasal alae during labored breathing blinking engorgement of the penis or clitoris during sleep opening and closing of the mouth wrinkling of the skin of the face motion of the intercostal spaces of the rib cage during breathing motion of the abdominal muscles during breathing monitoring of skin turgor and monitoring of changes in the amount of ascitic fluid in the abdomen. Proper placement of the loop 12 for each of the above applications will be apparent to those skilled in the art once this description is known. Possible invasive applications include monitoring movement of particular surface areas of the heart and lungs. Since the scope of the present invention is intended to incorporate various changes and modifications to the preferred apparatus described hereinabove, this description should be construed as illustrative, and not in a limiting sense, the scope of the invention being defined by the following claims.
