## Description
Method and means for concrete cavity bulding The present invention relates to a method and means for concrete cavity building.More particularly, the method and relative means are directed to the construction of burial niches for burying, in which a plurality of burial niches or tombs or niches one near the other, divided by a concrete wall and placed in several superimposed storeys are provided, with the characteristic that each burial niche has a frontal opening for the access.The methods known in prior art are the followings 1. the oldest system consists in a first concrete layer grouting with a set of vertical reinforcing steel rods protrusion for the post walls and then, to consolidate it, in providing to the vertical walls forms setting up for only the height concerning the inside light of the burial niches in order to grout the concrete into the forms to realize the partition walls and then carry out a successive hardening dismantlement, proceed to the reshuttering of the following covering slab, grouting and so on 2. a more recent method consists in utilizing metallic forms with metallic cores for the concrete grouting to build said burial niches 3. an even more recent solution provides the utilization of wood cores shaped as pre fabricated hollow open boxes in the place of the metallic cores which however remain fixed in the concrete layer and are wasted.The first method, more simplistic, involves a large amount of shuttering material and manual labour, with high execution costs and a long time for construction the second method is much more efficient than the first one but it involves the utilization of an expensive equipment, it requires transport and handling of very heavy metallic caissons and the utilization of likewise heavy metallic cores, which after every concrete layer must be accurately scraped off, cleaned and then re oiled with detaching material layer the third method, more rapid than the preceding ones, obviously is of considerable cost for the loss of the used cores which remain fixed in the concrete layer of the burial niches.Scope of the present invention is to provide a remedy to said disadvantages and in particular the invention as claimed solves the problem carrying out an expanded plastic form core, therefore extremely light, being said form core covered with a throw away plastic covering bag.The advantages offered by the invention are mainly that extremely light cores are utilized, therefore losing, during their extraction, only the relative covering bags, thus saving with reference to the first solution, the expensive forms with reference to the second solution, the handling of heavy form cores, their cleaning and treating with detaching materials with reference to the third solution, the losing of only the very cheap flexible covering bags. According to tests, the best cores in expanded material are those realized in expanded polystyrene which can be used several times and, according to the experiments, more than ten times, which will involve a very low cost in burial niches construction.Besides, further improvements of the invention provide to make easy the extraction of said form cores in expanded material, by means of holes passing through them in co operation with metallic means fixed in the cores for the relative extractions, thus allowing, during the core extraction, the passage of air from the front surface to the back chamber, avoiding vacuum formation in the back chamber which would make extremely difficult the extraction of said core, if not even its breaking, due to the material lightness and scant resistance.Some ways of carrying out the invention are described in detail below with reference to the annexed drawings which illustrate some preferred embodiments, in which Figure 1 shows a first form of the core in a perspective view Figure 2 is a back view of the core shown in Figure 1 Figure 3 is a sectional transversl longitudinal view on the vertical plane of the core shown in Figure 1 Figure 4 is a section on the median transversal horizontal plane of a modified form core with a transversally placed iron reinforcement for the extraction, in order to allow the core extraction in a transversal direction instead of longitudinal direction as the preceding ones Figure 5 is a first step frontal view of reinforced concrete burial niches set realized with a longitudinal extraction form core system of the type shown in Figures 1,2,3 Figure 6 is a plan view of the first disposition of the form cores for grouting the concrete according to Figure 5 Figure 7 is an upright sectional view on the vertical longitudinal plane of the concrete grouting of a firts row of burial niches as shown in the preceding Figures 5,6.More particularly, Figures 1,2,3 show a form core for longitudinal horizontal extraction, which is constituted by two parallelepipedal expanded polystyrene blocks 1,2, slightly rounded at the corners 3 and presenting a longitudinal groove 4 in such a way that when joined on a opposed joining face 5, a parallelepiped block as shown in Figure 1, with a slight tapering for the extraction on the four lateral longitudinal surfaces X can be realized with grooved back surface 6 for the purposes which will be explained further. Said tapered oc lateral longitudinal surfaces can be also longitudinally grooved to make the extraction easier.The two half blocks 1,2, before being glued together on the opposed joining faces 5, receive a grooving metallic tie rod 7 supporting a front projecting ring 8 constitued by two half plates 9 , 9 jointed by a longitudinal central welt welding 10, and said plate 9 is glued on the grooved back surface 6 of the two half blocks 1,2, and presents holes 11 which communicate with the free space of the longitudinal groove 4 in such a way that air can freely pass from the front surface of the block form core to the back surface to avoid vacuum formation and make the extraction easier.As it can be noticed from Figures 5,6,7, after the concrete foundation slab 14 with vertical reinforcement nets 15 is grout, the form cores A are placed equidistant and parallel one near the other by means of supporting and spacing vertical posts 16 in order to realize around the cores A an interspace perimetrically contained by the caisson form C cooperating with upper spacers d for further grouting of the concrete walls in a progressive step placing a board over the cores A not shown in order to avoid their displacement in an alternative embodiment, on the form core upper face 13, under the cover bag 12, a steel plate is placed, glued on the upper half block surface 1 . The grouting can be made first to realize the back concrete wall Sp and after the lateral walls Sl completing the grouting to realize the entire thickness of the covering slab defined by the spacers d and height of the back or lateral vertical panels C .When the upper grout surface 17 has been levelled, and after a slight hardening of the concrete a new row of form cores A can be applied on to prosecute the building process in similar manner.When the concrete is hardened, the extraction of the entire form core blocks 1,2 can be carried out for each burial niche, while the plastic covering 12 remains fixed in the hardened concrete.
