# Electronic ballast inverter circuit.

## Abstract
An electronic ballast inverter circuit 10 for powering one or more fluorescent lamps or the like includes two identical circuits 100, 200 operating at different DC offsets, each circuit including a tank circuit 101, 201 composed of a primary winding 102, 202 of the power transformer T1 and a capacitor 104, 204 such that each tank circuit 101, 201 resonates at the same frequency, and including a switching transistor 106, 206 or the like connected to each tank circuit 101, 201 . These two transistors 106, 206 are operative on alternate half cycles of the sine wave gen erated by the inverter, so as to obtain the push pull oper ation needed by the inverter. Each circuit includes a base drive current source for each transistor 106, 206 that is controlled by the polarity of an additional primary winding 130, 230 of the power transformer T1 . For improved effi ciency, the circuit is designed to be operable from an un smoothed DC voltage source.
