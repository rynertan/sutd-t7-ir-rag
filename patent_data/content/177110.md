# Process for accelerating amorphization of intermetallic compounds by a chemical reaction using lattice defects.

## Abstract
Amorphization of intermetallic compounds of Zr Al alloys is accelerated by arranging artifically lattice defects at given positions and in given forms in the crystals of the intermetallic compounds, and then forming amorphous regions at the lattice defects by hydrogen absorption under a hydrogen gas atmosphere.
