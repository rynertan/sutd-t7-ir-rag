# Surgical dressing.

## Abstract
A moisture vapour permeable, adhesive surgical dres sing is described which comprises a continuous film of a hydrophilic polymer which has a moisture vapour permea bility which is greater when in contact with water than when not in contact with water and which is attached around its edges to a water transmitting film so as to form a sealed portion into which exudate may pass from an exuding wound. The water transmitting film comprises a backing layer and an adhesive layer on the side remote from the continuous film. The adhesive layer is suitable for adhering the dressing to the skin. The water transmitting film allows or is adapted to allow access of water to the film when in contact with water so that when used on an exuding wound the high moisture vapour permeability of the continuous film allows water to evaporate through the dressing and prevents the dressing forming a blister. The low moisture vapour permeability of the film when not in contact with water makes the dressing suitable for use non exuding wounds. Preferably a second water trans mitting film is present between the continuous film and the water transmitting layer.
