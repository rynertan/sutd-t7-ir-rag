# DIALKYL SULPHOSUCCINATE COMPOSITION AND PROCESS FOR ITS PREPARATION

## Abstract
Dialkyl sulphosuccinates containing less than 0.3 ma leate fumarate may readily be prepared at high concentra tions 77 90 by weight by the sulphitation of the corre sponding dialkyl maleates fumarates in a mixture of C₁ C₄ alcohol and water, without the need for other solvents or special catalysts, because at this very high concentration level there exist coinciding regions of low viscosity at both reaction and storage temperatures. The sulphiting agent is used in solid form, and inorganic solids are removed by filtration or other physical separation methods at the end of this reaction.
