## Description
The present invention relates to a bimorph element and, more particularly, to a piezoelectric actuator using a unidirectional polarization type bimorph element. Compact, light weight, low power telephone terminal devices have been recently developed, and demand has arisen for the development of highly effective drive components. Conventional drive components have been electromagnets. However, an electromagnet generates only a small force at the initial stage of its operation and requires a spring to restore the initial state, thereby degrading efficiency. The conventional drive unit using the electromagnet cannot satisfy requirements of compactness and low power consumption. For this reason, a coin processing apparatus requiring a telephone station power source results in large size and high cost. A compact, thin, low power drive component may comprise a known PZT trade name bimorph element available from Krebeit Inc. However, a conventional PZT bimorph element provides only a small displacement and a small force. A power of up to 10 mW is required to hold a switching state of a driver so as to keep the bimorph element displaced at one side upon application of a voltage thereto. In addition to these disadvantages, this bimorph element has a large hysteresis and a low resistance to mechanical impact and cannot be used in the coin processing apparatus. In the PZT bimorph element, two piezoceramic elements, i.e., piezoelectric plates which consist of lead zirconate titanate and which are polarized along the direction of thickness thereof are overlapped. One end of each of the piezoceramic elements is fixed. Under these conditions, a voltage having the same polarity as the polarization of the piezoceramic elements is applied to one piezoceramic element, and a voltage having a polarity opposite to the polarization of the piezoceramic elements is applied to the other piezoceramic element. In other words, an electric field acting along the direction of thickness is applied to the respective piezoceramic elements which are displaced along opposing directions in accordance with a piezoelectric transverse displacement effect, thereby flexing the free end portions thereof. Conventional bimorph elements are classified into a parallel type element wherein the overlapping piezoceramic elements are polarized in one direction with respect to the direction of thickness thereof, and a series type wherein the overlapping piezoceramic elements are polarized in opposing directions with respect to the direction of thickness thereof. The parallel type element can provide a large displacement at a low voltage and can be used in place of the electromagnet. However, as described above, a voltage is applied to one piezoceramic element in the same direction as the polarization of the elements, and another voltage is applied to the other piezoceramic element in a direction opposite to the polarization, thereby displacing the free ends along a given direction. Thereafter, the polarities of the applied voltages are switched to restore the initial polarization states of the piezoceramic elements. Although the above operation must be repeated, in the piezoceramic element with the applied voltage having a polarity opposite to its polarization direction, the polarization effect becomes weakened. Since a piezoelectric actuator must provide a maximum displacement, a power source voltage must be increased. However, if a bimorph element comprises two piezoceramic elements each of which has a thickness of about 0.15 mm and whose material has a field strength of 580 V mm, when the power source voltage increases to about 80 V to 85 V, the polarization of the piezoceramic elements is disturbed, and the resultant displacement becomes very small. A practical applied voltage is limited to 1 2 to 1 3 of the polarization breakdown voltage. For example, in this parallel type element, a displacement of about 1 mm in a bimorph element having a length of 45 mm is obtained at a voltage of 30 V. In this manner, when a conventional drive circuit is used although the parallel type element is used, a large displacement cannot be obtained since the power source voltage is limited. A polarity switching circuit must have electrical characteristics wherein a high voltage can be switched, a switched state can be held at a low power, and carriers charged by the bimorph element at the time of switching can be immediately discharged. However, none of the conventional switching circuits can satisfy these electrical characteristics. In addition, when the bimorph element is used as an actuator for coin processing, a large impact acts on the distal end of the bimorph element as an operating end and the piezoceramic elements may often be damaged. Conventional mechanisms for protecting the elements from damage have not been substantially proposed. It is, therefore, a principal object of the present invention to provide a piezoelectric actuator using a bimorph element wherein a large displacement can be obtained with a large force at a low power without degradation of the polarization of the piezoceramic elements of the bimorph element. FR A 2127657 describes a piezoelectric actuator comprising That arrangement utilizes an alternating drive voltage and the drive circuit includes parallel connected rectifiers and resistors arranged so that when the electric field of the applied alternating voltage is directed against the sense of polarization of a piezo element, it still has no depolarization effect on the piezo element even in the case of unfavourable operational conditions. The present invention is characterized in that GB A 2011734 describes several piezoelectric actuators, two of which are described as having piezo elements polarized across their thickness in the same sense as one another. In one such case the applied voltage may cause depolarization. In the other case a DC bias is utilized in addition to the AC drive voltage such that depolarization of the piezo elements is avoided because the voltage direction is not reversed. US A 3821747 describes a further piezoelectric actuator utilizing an alternating current supply. Embodiments of the present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 shows a piezoelectric actuator using a bimorph element according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to Fig. 1, this piezoelectric actuator basically comprises a parallel type bimorph element 1, a drive input circuit 2, a polarity switching circuit 3, a constant voltage circuit 4, a control circuit 5 and a DC power source E The drive input circuit 2 comprises a Zener diode ZD1, i.e., a constant voltage diode, a cathode of which is connected to the electrode T1 of the piezoceramic element H1 a Zener diode ZD2, an anode of which is connected to the electrode T2 of the piezoceramic element H2 a resistor R1 of a high resistance connected between the electrode T1 and the middle electrode S and a resistor R2 of a high resistance connected between the central electrode S and the electrode T2. The remaining terminals of the Zener diodes ZD1 and ZD2 are commonly connected, and a common junction point is connected to a terminal A. A junction point i.e., the central electrode 5 between the resistors R1 and R2 is connected to a terminal B. The resistors R1 and R2 may be omitted, as indicated by dotted lines. The polarity switching circuit 3 comprises a Darlington connected pnp transistor pair DTr1, an output of which is connected between the terminal A and a terminal C a Darlington connected pnp transistor pair DTr2, an output of which is connected between the terminal B and the terminal C an NPN transistor TR2, an output of which is connected between the terminal B and a terminal G and an NPN transistor Tr4 an output of which is connected between the terminal B and the terminal G . These transistors are bridged as a polarity switch. The input electrode base of the transistor pair DTr1 is connected to the collector of an NPN transistor Tr7 through a resistor R3. The emitter of the NPN transistor Tr7 is grounded. The base of the transistor Tr7 is connected to an output terminal of an inverter INV through a resistor R4. The emitter of the transistor Tr2 is connected to the output terminal of the inverter INV through a resistor R5. The input electrode base of the transistor pair DTr2 is connected to the collector of an NPN transistor Tr6 through a resistor R7. The emitter of the NPN transistor Tr6 is grounded. The base of the transistor Tr6 is connected to the input terminal of the inverter INV through a resistor R8 and to the control circuit 5. The base of the transistor Tr4 is also connected to the input terminal of the inverter INV through a resistor R9. The control circuit 5 causes a combination of the transistor pair DTr1 and the transistor Tr2 and a combination of the transistor pair DTr2 and the transistor Tr4 in the polarity switching circuit 3 to be alternately switched to control polarity switching of the voltage applied to the bimorph element 1. The control circuit 5 comprises a resistor R10, a switch SW1 and a DC power source E The constant voltage circuit 4 comprises a self excited ringing choke DC DC converter using a PNP transistor. The constant voltage circuit 4 comprises a saturating transformer TR having coils ℓ1, ℓ2 and ℓ3 which are wound in the same direction a capacitor C8 and an electrolytic capacitor C1 resistors RB and RS, a PNP transistor Q1, a diode D1 and a Zener diode ZD3. The transistor Q1 together with one end of the coil ℓ2 is connected to a positive terminal F of the DC power source E The operation of the constant voltage circuit 4 in Fig. 1 will be described. When a voltage i.e., 5 V is applied from the DC power source E The operation of the polarity switching circuit 3 will be described. When the control circuit causes the switch SW1 to set in the position as illustrated in Fig. 1, the output from the inverter INV becomes the same as the voltage from the power source E When a reverse biased Zener diode is connected in series with the piezoceramic element, the power source voltage is divided, and its principle will be briefly described. The bimorph element comprises a capacitive load. In this sense, each piezoceramic element can be regarded as a capacitor C When the switch SW1 in the control circuit 5 is connected to the power source E The reason for inclusion of a case wherein in the present invention the voltage V One of the main features of the present invention lies in the fact that a constant voltage V Inequalities 1 and 2 can be applied to this case. However, even if inequalities 1 and 2 are satisfied, the voltage applied in the direction opposite to the polarization direction is limited. When this voltage comes closer to the voltage Vp, depolarization is abruptly increased, as shown in Fig. 4A. Therefore, even if the polarization effect is obtained, the element has unstable characteristics. In practice, inequality 3 must also be satisfied. As is apparent from the above description, the driving method for positively utilizing the polarization effect is very effective when a voltage higher than the voltage Vd is applied while the polarities of such a voltage are switched. When a conventional analog AC power source is used, application of a sufficient voltage to recover the depolarization effect cannot be guaranteed. In the present invention, the voltages Vp and Vd greatly depend on changes in temperatures. The voltages Vp and Vd must be defined at a given operation temperature. However, the voltages Vp and Vd have negative temperature coefficients and can decrease at high temperatures. In practice, the voltages Vp and Vd are preferably defined at the upper limit of the operating temperature. Fig. 4B is another graph for explaining the effect of the present invention. Fig. 4B shows a case wherein the bimorph element in Fig. 4A is operated for a long period of time at a voltage V The driving method has been described wherein the polarization effect when polarity inversion is utilized. However, when the duty is very small or polarity inversion can be little expected, the following inequality is preferably satisfied The reason why the Darlington transistor pairs DTr1 and DTr2 are used in Fig. 1 will be described hereinafter. In order to operate one of the Darlington transistor pairs DTr1 and DTr2 so as to switch the polarity of the voltage, the base current must be flowed from the constant voltage circuit 4. However, since the voltage is high, even a small current causes high power consumption. The bimorph element serves as a capacitive load, so power is not required to maintain the displacement. However, when the polarity switching circuit 3 greatly consumes power so as to hold the switching state, the bimorph loses its advantage as a low power element. The Darlington transistor pairs DTr1 and DTr2 are used to increase the current amplification factor. The current flowed in the bimorph element 1 is approximately several to several tens of milliamperes. When a current amplification factor of the Darlington transistor pair is set at about 10⁴, the required base current is not more than several microamperes. Even if the 100 V constant voltage circuit 4 is used, power required to maintain the switched state is about 0.1 to 1 mW. In the polarity switching circuit 3, each of the resistors R3 and R7 has a resistance of several to several tens of megohms. Resistors having such high resistance can be easily mounted by soldering on a ceramic board. The respective components can be of low current capacity, so that chip components can be used. Therefore, the components, including the polarity switching circuit 3 and the drive input circuit 2 but excluding the transformer TR of the constant voltage circuit 4 can be obtained as a hybrid I The operation of the constant current diode CRD will be described. The constant current diode CRD can be replaced with a resistor. However, the constant current diode has an advantage over a resistor. Figs. 5A to 5F are diagrams for explaining the advantage of the constant current diode CRD over a resistor. As shown in Fig. 5A, when a bimorph element C is charged by a constant voltage power source V However, when a bimorph element C is charged by a constant voltage power source V The operation of the Zener diode ZD7 connected across the input terminals of the polarity switching circuit 3 will be described. As shown in Fig. 1, when one i.e., the terminal A of the terminals of the polarity switching circuit 3 is positive, polarity switching is performed. In this case, the carriers charged by the bimorph element 1 are discharged through a path of the electrodes H1 and H2, the Zener diodes ZD1 and ZD2 in the drive input circuit 2, the terminal A, the transistor Tr4 in the polarity switching circuit 3, the terminal G , the Zener diode forward bias ZD7, the terminal C , the transistor pair Dtr2 in the polarity switching circuit 3, the terminal B and the central electrode S. At the same time or thereafter, the charge current flows from the constant voltage circuit 4 through a path of the constant current diode CRD, the transistor pair DTr2 in the polarity switching circuit 3, the terminal B, the drive input circuit 2, the electrodes S, T1 and T2 in the bimorph element 1, the Zener diodes ZD1 and ZD2 of the drive input terminal 2, the terminal A, and the transistor Tr4 in the polarity switching circuit 3. The bimorph element 1 is charged. In this manner, in order to cancel the charge, the forward bias characteristics of the Zener diode ZD7 are used to decrease the power consumption. In the above description, the forward bias characteristics of the Zener diode ZD7 are required. Therefore, a normal diode can be used in place of the Zener diode. However, the reason why the Zener diode is used is that a surge voltage exceeding the power source voltage or V In Fig. 1, a bridge circuit, i.e., the same circuit as the polarity switching circuit 3 is connected in parallel with the terminals C and G to drive a plurality of bimorph elements using one power source. Fig. 6 shows a bimorph element according to another embodiment of the present invention. A plurality of electrodes are sandwiched between piezoceramic elements with respect to a central electrode S. In this embodiment, a pair of piezoceramic elements H11 and H21 polarized downward are formed on the upper and lower surfaces of the central electrode S. Another pair of piezoceramic elements H12 and H22 polarized upward are formed on the piezoceramic elements H11 and H21 through electrodes T11 and T21, respectively. Still another pair of piezoceramic elements H13 and H23 polarized in the same manner as the piezoceramic elements H11 and H21 are formed on the piezoceramic elements H12 and H22 through electrodes T12 and T22, respectively. In this manner, a six layer bimorph element is constituted. A drive input circuit 21 is arranged as follows. The central electrode S sandwiched between the piezoceramic elements H11 and H21, the electrode T12 sandwiched between the piezoceramic elements H13 and H12, and the electrode T22 sandwiched between the piezoceramic elements H22 and H23 are commonly connected to a terminal B. An electrode T13 formed on the upper surface of the piezoceramic element H13 and the electrode T11 sandwiched between the piezoceramic elements H12 and H11 are connected to the cathodes of Zener diodes ZD12 and ZD11 and then to a terminal A. The electrode T21 sandwiched between the piezoceramic elements H21 and H22 and an electrode T23 formed on the piezoceramic element H23 are connected to the anodes of Zener diodes ZD21 and ZD22 and then to the terminal A. When the terminal A is set at a positive potential, a voltage V Fig. 7 shows another arrangement of a drive input circuit for driving the bimorph element shown in Fig. 1. Referring to Fig. 7, thyristors Th1 and Th2 are connected in parallel with the Zener diodes ZD1 and ZD2, respectively. A series circuit of a resistor R21 and the Zener diode ZD1 is connected in parallel with a series circuit of a Zener diode ZD3 and the thyristor Th1. In, this case, in the same manner as the Zener diode ZD1, the anode of the Zener diode ZD3 is connected to the terminal A. The cathode of the Zener diode ZD3 is connected to the cathode of the thyristor Th1. The anode of the thyristor Th1 is connected together with the cathode of the Zener diode ZD1 to the electrode T1 contacting the positive polarization surface of the piezoceramic element H1. A common junction between one end of a resistor R24 and the anode of the Zener diode ZD5 is connected to the gate of the thyristor Th1. The other end of the resistor R24 is connected to the cathode of the thyristor Th1, and the other electrode cathode of the Zener diode ZD5 is connected to the anode of the thyristor Th1. A series circuit of a resistor R22 and the Zener diode ZD2 is connected in parallel with a series circuit of a Zener diode ZD4 and a thyristor Th2. In this case, in the same manner as the Zener diode ZD2, the cathode of the Zener diode ZD4 is connected to the terminal A, and the anode thereof is connected to the anode of the thyristor Th2. The cathode of the thyristor Th2 is connected together with the anode of the Zener diode ZD2 to the electrode T2 contacting the negative polarization surface of the piezoceramic element H2. A common junction between one end of a resistor R25 and the anode of a Zener diode ZD6 is connected to the gate of the thyristor Th2. The other end of the resistor R25 is connected to the cathode of the thyristor Th2, and the other electrode cathode of the Zener diode ZD6 is connected to the anode of the thyristor Th2. The purpose of this drive input circuit will be described hereinafter. A maximum displacement is required when a piezoelectric actuator is subjected to polarization switching. The piezoelectric actuator must be driven at high velocity as needed. In this case, the characteristics of the element shown in Fig. 1 are often not sufficient. Since the bimorph element has hysteresis characteristics When a material having a low polarization degradation voltage is used, a voltage having a polarity opposite to the polarization direction cannot be applied to the bimorph element for a long period of time, but it is often desired that a displacement and the resultant force be large at the time of polarization switching. In this case, in the circuit of Fig. 1, the Zener diodes ZD1 or ZD2 are replaced with the corresponding thyristors or are used together therewith to improve the characteristics. In the arrangement in Fig. 7, it is impossible to apply an excessive voltage to the piezoceramic element in a direction opposite to the polarization direction for a long period of time, but a voltage higher than the polarization degradation voltage Vd can be applied for a short period of time. Under this assumption, a high voltage is applied to the bimorph element only when it is subjected to polarization switching. The operation of the circuit shown in Fig. 7 will be described. The Zener diodes ZD1 to ZD6 satisfy the following inequalities V When the polarization is inverted, the terminal B is set at a positive potential, and the terminal A is set at the ground potential. The electrode T1 formed on the upper surface of the piezoceramic element H1 is set at a voltage of 2V When the polarity is inverted again, the voltage V Since the high voltage is applied in the direction opposite to the polarization direction when the polarization switching is performed, the bimorph element is displaced with a large force. However when the voltage applied in the direction opposite to the polarization direction decreases below the polarization degradation voltage due to self discharge, degradation characteristics will not occur. When this circuit is used, the influence of the above mentioned hysteresis characteristics can be omitted. Therefore, even if the bimorph element is driven at high speed, the displacement magnitude will not be decreased. A drive input circuit according to still another embodiment will be described with reference to Fig. 10 wherein the polarization degradation voltage is low and a high voltage having a polarity opposite to the polarization direction of the piezoceramic element cannot be applied to the piezoceramic element for a long period of time. Referring to Fig. 10, a series circuit of a Zener diode ZD3 and a thyristor Th1 and a series circuit consisting of a resistor R24 and a Zener diode ZD5 to turn on off the thyristor Th1 are used in the same manner as in the arrangement of Fig. 7. In the embodiment in Fig. 10, a diode D10 is used in place of the series circuit of the resistor R21 and the Zener diode ZD1. Only the Zener diode ZD2 is connected between the electrode T2 and the terminal A connected to the piezoceramic element H2. In this case, the cathode of the diode D10 is connected to the electrode T1 of the piezoceramic element H1. The anode of the Zener diode ZD2 is connected to the electrode T2. The operation of the drive input circuit in Fig. 10 will be described hereinafter. Assume that the terminal B connected to the central electrode S is set at a positive potential, and that the polarity of the voltage is intermittently inverted in a pulsed manner. In this case, since the terminal B is set at the positive potential, no voltage is applied to the piezoceramic element H1 since the diode D10 is reverse biased. The voltage V Since the voltage V Fig. 12 shows still another modification of the drive input circuit for the bimorph element. Two PNPN Shockley diodes are used in place of the thyristors. In this case, a diode D1 is inserted between the terminal A and the electrode T1 of the piezoceramic element H1. The cathode of the diode D1 is connected to the electrode T1. A Shockley diode SD1 is connected in parallel with the diode D1 and is reverse biased with respect to the diode D1. A discharge resistor R1 having a high resistance is connected between the electrode T1 and the central electrode S the terminal B . The connection between the piezoceramic element H2 and the corresponding drive input circuit portion is opposite to that between the piezoceramic plate H1 and the corresponding drive input circuit portion. One end of a diode D2 is connected to the terminal A, and the anode of the diode D2 is connected to the electrode T2 of the piezoceramic element H2. A Shockley diode SD2 is connected in parallel with the diode D2 and is reverse biased with respect to the diode D2. A discharge resistor R2 is connected between the electrode T2 and the central electrode S the terminal B . The voltages applied to the piezoceramic elements H1 and H2 and the polarization directions are illustrated in Fig. 13. In this case, application of voltages to the respective piezoceramic elements in the direction opposite to their polarization direction are performed only when the polarities of the voltages are inverted. The Shockley diodes SD1 and SD2 are turned on at a voltage lower than the voltage of 2V Fig. 14 shows a polarity switching circuit wherein a control circuit of the polarity switching circuit 3 is simplified to hold the switching state with lower power. This polarity switching circuit is characterized in that the transistors Tr2 and Tr4 of the polarity switching circuit 3 in Fig. 1 are replaced with Darlington transistor pairs DTr2 and DTr4, and the bases of the Darlington transistor pairs DTr1 and DTr3 are connected to the collectors of the Darlington transistor pairs DTr2 and DTr4 through diodes, respectively. More particularly, the base of the Darlington transistor pair DTr1 is connected to the collector of the Darlington transistor pair DTr2 through a resistor R31 having a high resistance and a forward bias diode D11. The base of the transistor pair DTr3 is connected to the collector of the transistor pair DTr4 through a resistor R32 having a high resistance and a forward bias diode D12. A diode D14 is connected between the transistor pair DTr2 and the terminal B the collector of the transistor pair DTr3 such that the anode of the diode D14 is connected to the terminal B. A diode D15 is connected between the transistor pair DTr4 connected to the diode D12 and the terminal A such that the anode of the diode D15 is connected to the terminal A. The polarity switching circuit 3 also has an NPN transistor Tr7. The collector of the transistor Tr7 is connected to the base of the transistor pair DTr2 through a resistor R34, and the emitter of the transistor Tr7 is connected to the input terminal G of the polarity switching circuit 3. The base of the transistor Tr7 is connected to a terminal F for a PC power source E The operation of the polarity switching circuit 3 will be described. When the terminal J is connected to the terminal G of the control circuit 5 and is set at low level, a current will not flow in the base of the transistor Tr7 which is then kept off. The collector of the transistor Tr7 goes to high level, and the transistor pair DTr2 is turned on. A base current flows in the base of the transistor pair DTr1, so that the transistor pair DTr1 is turned on. When the terminal J is connected to the terminal F of the control circuit 5 and is set at high level, the transistor pair DTr4 is turned on and a current flows to the base of the transistor pair DTr3 to turn it on. However, when the terminal J goes high, the transistor Tr7 is turned on, and the collector of the transistor Tr7 is set at low level. The base circuit for the transistor pair DTr2 is set at the ground level and is thus turned off. In this manner, polarity switching can be performed in accordance with the operation whether the terminal J is set at the ground level low or the E Fig. 15 shows another arrangement of the polarity switching circuit using a PNPN switch thyristor photocoupler. Referring to Fig. 15, reference symbols PN1 to PN4 denote PNPN switches which constitute a bridge circuit. A common junction K1 between the anodes of the PNPN switches PN1 and PN3 is connected to a terminal C of the constant voltage circuit 4. A common junction K2 between the cathodes of the PNPN switches PN2 and PN4 is connected to a terminal G . The cathode of the PNPN switch PN1 is connected to the anode of the PNPN switch PN4. The cathode of the PNPN switch PN3 and the anode of the PNPN switch PN2 are connected to the drive terminals A and B of the drive input circuit 2, respectively. Reference symbols LED1 to LED4 denote light emitting diodes for emitting light L onto the PNPN switches PN1 to PN4 to turn on the switches PN1 to PN4, respectively SW4 and SW5, switches which have an FET, MOS, CMOS element structure and which do not require the control circuit power INV, an inverter for inverting a logic input level and PUL, a pulse generator for enabling disabling the logic control voltage E The operation of the above polarity switching circuit 3 will be described. When a power switch not shown is turned on, the pulse generator PUL is started. When the switch SW1 in the control circuit 5 is set in the position illustrated in Fig. 15, the voltage from the power source E A pulse interval τ2 of the output from the pulse generator PUL is preferably long enough to decrease control power. However, when the pulse interval becomes excessively long, a slight displacement rebound occurs. A slight vibration occurs at the displacement side in synchronism with the pulse width. In order to prevent this, the pulse interval is preferably not more than 100 ms. However, when the pulse interval τ2 becomes short, the above mentioned slight vibration will not occur, and high speed operation can be performed. However, when the pulse interval becomes shorter than the charge time constant and the switch SW1 is operated at high speed, the PNPN switches PN3 and PN4 which are connected in a diagonal relationship are often driven while the PNPN switches PN1 and PN2 which are connected in parallel with each other are held ON, thereby short circuiting the bridge circuit. In order to prevent this, the pulse interval is preferably not less than 0.5 ms. In effect, the pulse interval τ2 falls within the range between 0.5 ms and 100 ms. A pulse width τ1 is determined in accordance with the switch sensitivity and is set at several tens of microseconds. Therefore, the duty becomes 1 50 to 1 10,000, and the control power for holding the bimorph element 1 in the displacement position becomes very small. It should be noted an LED current IF 20 mA 5 V achieves a power of not more than 0.1 mW at a duty of not more than 1 1,000. The polarity switching circuit 3 in Fig. 15 has a smoothing circuit surrounded by the alternate long and short dashed line between the bridge circuit and the terminals A and B. The smoothing circuit will be described in detail hereinafter. As described above, when the pulse width is excessively increased, the bimorph element irregularly vibrates at a displaced position, so that the pulse width must fall within the predetermined range. In order to prevent such an irregular vibration, a smoothing circuit is inserted between the bimorph element 1 and the bridge circuit. The smoothing circuit comprises a combination of a capacitor C Still another embodiment of the present invention will be described. The gate of the PNPN switch is separated from the control circuit by using the photocoupler in Fig. 15. However, the PNPN switch can be isolated from the control circuit by using a P N reverse junction. As shown in Fig. 16, current driven PNPN switches are used, and the gate circuit is isolated from the logic control circuit by using the P N reverse junction of the transistor. Referring to Fig. 16, reference symbols PN1 and PN3 denote N channel gate PNPN switches thyristors PN2 and PN4, P channel gate PNPN switches thyristors and R Assume that a bimorph element is used as an actuator wherein one end is fixed and the other end is used as an operating portion subjected to displacement. When a large acceleration acts on the bimorph actuator, the bimorph element is often cut in the vicinity of a fixed portion 30, as shown in Fig. 17. Reference symbol ξ1 denotes the displacement caused by a voltage applied to the bimorph element 1 and ξ2, the maximum displacement representing the limit subject to mechanical destruction. The above mentioned acceleration is generated when main equipment incorporating a coin processing unit is accidentally dropped and receives a strong impact. In order to prevent the bimorph element 1 from being displaced exceeding the displacement ξ2, a back stopper 32 is disposed to limit the displacement of the bimorph element. The back stopper 32 has regulating surfaces 32a and 32b to prevent a displacement exceeding the displacement ξ2. When the back stopper 32 is disposed to limit a displacement corresponding to the displacement ξ1, the residual vibration of the bimorph element 1 can be prevented. Fig. 19 shows a still another embodiment wherein the bimorph element 1 is mounted in a case to obtain a bimorph actuator in accordance with the principle in Fig. 18. Projections 40a and 40b are formed on parts of a substantially U shaped case 40 and opposed to the operating portion i.e., the free end of the bimorph element 1. The projections 40a and 40b serve as a displacement regulation mechanism. The bimorph element 1 is fixed on a base 42 mounted on the inner bottom surface of the case 40. Although the bimorph element 1 generates a large force when the polarity of the voltage is inverted, the element 1 cannot serve as an actuator at a near end displacement position since the force becomes zero. For this reason, the displacement of the bimorph element 1 must not reach the near end position. In order to resolve this difficulty, a magnetic mechanism may be used. Referring to Fig. 19, a central electrode S of the bimorph element 1 comprises a magnetic spring. Magnets 43a and 43b are disposed in the vicinities of the displacement regulation mechanisms 40a and 40b so as to oppose the magnetic spring. The attraction characteristics of the magnets 43a and 43b are indicated by the dotted lines, and the forces generated when the bimorph element 1 is displaced from the displaced position at the projection 40a in the direction indicated by the arrow upon inversion of the polarity of the voltage, are indicated by the alternate long and short dashed line in Fig. 20. The acting force of this mechanism is indicated by the solid line. The force is generated in the vicinity of the displacement end position, so that the bimorph element 1 can serve as an actuator. Since the central electrode S comprises a magnetic member, the magnetic attraction mechanism can be obtained in such a manner that the magnets 43a and 43b are disposed to oppose each other with respect to the central electrode S. Fig. 21 shows a construction wherein two plastic insulating layers 45a and 45b are formed on a bimorph element 1 so as to improve reliability and durability against the outer atmosphere when the bimorph element is used as an actuator. In this case, the insulating layer 45a constitutes an inner layer made of a soft resin material, and the insulating layer 45b constitutes an outer layer made of a hard resin material. With this construction, the reliability of the bimorph element as an actuator can be improved. In addition, this bimorph element has a good electrical resistance, and a good resistance to humidity. The distal end of the operating portion the free end has a good wear resistance and a low friction resistance. Therefore, the force can be effectively transmitted to a driven mechanism. The resin material preferably comprises an ultraviolet curing resin. Fig. 22 shows an application example of a unit structure wherein a swinging displacement of the bimorph element 1 is extracted through a seesaw mechanism. Reference numeral 51 denotes a transmission lever connected to the operating end free end of the bimorph element 1 and 52, a seesaw mechanism pivotally supported by a shaft 53. Excess external force is absorbed by the seesaw mechanism 52, thus further improving reliability of the bimorph actuator. The support 42 for supporting the bimorph element 1 is fixed on a base 40A. An upper case 40B covers the bimorph element 1 so as not to obstruct operation of the bimorph element 1. A U shaped recess is formed at one end of the seesaw mechanism 52 and is loosely fitted with the transmission lever 51. The other end of the seesaw mechanism 52 externally extends through a notch 55 of the upper case 40B. The distal end of the extended portion swings in the directions indicated by arrows upon vibration of the bimorph element 1. A guide hole 57 and threaded bimorph electrode terminals 58 are formed in the base 40A so as to easily mount the base 40A to another fixed member. Displacement restraint mechanisms are mounted on end portions 59a and 59b of the seesaw mechanism 52 to restrain rotation of the seesaw mechanism 52 exceeding a predetermined angle. Fig. 23 shows the main part of the mechanism used in Fig. 22. The magnet 60a is mounted on the seesaw mechanism 52 in the vicinity of the portion 52 which is engaged with the lever 51, as indicated by the dotted line. The magnetic member 60b is mounted at a position on the base 40A which corresponds to the magnet 60a. A magnet 61a is mounted at an appropriate position of the seesaw mechanism so as to oppose the magnet 60a. A magnetic member 61b is mounted at a position of the base 40A which corresponds to the magnet 61a. In this case, the combination of the magnet and the magnetic member can be reversed. The two magnets can be magnetized with opposing polarities or can be arranged such that opposing poles face each other. Fig. 24 shows a construction wherein the lever and the seesaw mechanism shown in Figs. 22 and 23 are formed integrally. The free end of the bimorph element 1 is held by one end of the seesaw mechanism 52 to constitute a holding portion 52B. As a modification, the operating portion of the seesaw mechanism 52 of Fig. 22 may be located in the left side, and the arm which is located to the right of the shaft 53 may be omitted, as indicated by the dotted line. In this case, the motion of the operating portion corresponds to that of the bimorph element. In the example shown in Fig. 22, when a ratio of a distance between the shaft 53 and the bimorph movable end connecting portion to a distance between the shaft 53 and the operating portion is properly selected, a displacement of the bimorph at the operating portion can be increased decreased. An application example will be described with reference to Figs. 25, 26A and 26B wherein a piezoelectric actuator using the bimorph element of the present invention as a main feature is applied to a coin processing apparatus. Referring to Figs. 25, 26A and 26B, a coin rolling object drop mechanism 120 comprises a coin drop port formed midway on a guide plate constituting a coin guide 102 a lever member 122 as a drop port opening closing mechanism supported pivotally about a shaft 122a perpendicular to the coin guide 102 so as to open close a portion of the coin guide 102 which is located near the coin drop port 121 and the bimorph element 1 which has a lock portion 123a as a lock mechanism for locking the lever member 122 and which constitutes a coin drop drive mechanism. Reference numeral 124 denotes a base having a support 124a for supporting one end portion of the bimorph element 1 and 125, a cover mounted on the base 124 to constitute a case and which holds the bimorph element 1 therein. The unit type bimorph element 1 has been described with reference to Figs. 19 to 24. Reference numerals 124b and 124c denote stoppers for regulating the swinging movement of the operating end of the bimorph element 1 within a predetermined range in the case. A engaging portion 122b is engaged with the lock portion 123a mounted on the proximal end of the lever member 122. A blocking piece 122c extends along one end of the lever member 122 to open close the coin guide 102. The lever member 122 is arranged such that its blocking piece 122c is constantly biased by a torsion coil spring to block the coin guide 102. Reference numeral 127 denotes a stopper for stopping at a predetermined position the lever member 122 biased clockwise by a torsion spring. An opening 128 is formed in the other guide plate having a stopper surface 128a for receiving the blocking piece 122c when the blocking piece 122c is withdrawn from the coin guide 102. A photodetecting means 129 129a and 129b such as a photocoupler is arranged in the downstream side of the coin drop port 121 of the coin guide 102 to detect that the coin passes thereby. With the construction described above, a biasing force is constantly applied by the drive input circuit 2 in Fig. 1 to displace the bimorph element 1 in the direction indicated by arrow When the polarity of the voltage applied to the bimorph element 1 is inverted, the bimorph element 1 is displaced in a direction indicated by arrow When the inserted coin is detected by a coin detector to be an authentic coin, the voltage is applied to the bimorph element 1 which is then displaced in the direction indicated by arrow When the lever member 122 is pivoted by the weight of the coin K, return operation is delayed when the lever member 122 is excessively rotated. The stopper surface 128a serves to prevent excessive rotation of the lever member 122. When the lever member 122 returns to its initial position, the engaging portion 122b abuts against the stopper 127, resulting in chattering. The lock portion 123a cannot be released i.e., moved in the When the inserted coin is detected to be a counterfeit coin K0, or when the coin guide for storing wins is full, the polarity of the voltage applied to the bimorph element 1 is held for the lock side of the element 1. As a result, the rolling direction of the counterfeit coin K0 is changed by the lever blocking piece 122c, and the coin is dropped through the coin drop port 121. With the above construction, unlike the conventional construction using an electromagnet, since a spring or the like is not used to return the bimorph element 1 to its initial position, no large force acts on the bimorph element 1 irrespective of the swinging direction of the bimorph element 1. Furthermore, since a lock mechanism is employed wherein the lever member 122 having the blocking piece 122c facing the coin guide 102 is selectively locked by the lock portion 123a of the bimorph element 1, the displacement required for the bimorph element 1 can be minimized. A force acting on the bimorph element 1 through the lock Portion 123a when the coin abuts against the lever mechanism and drops comprises only a longitudinal tension component which presents no problem of mechanical strength. No force acts on the bimorph element 1 when the coin passes. In addition, when the lever 122 returns to its initial position by the restoration mechanism such as a return spring, no force generated by the bimorph element 1 is required. The bimorph element 1 can generate only a small force. The bimorph element 1 generally requires low drive power and can perform low power coin processing in addition to the effect described above. Furthermore, no large force acts on the bimorph element 1 during coin processing. Fatigue of the bimorph element 1 is thus small, resulting in high reliability. A large force can be generated by the bimorph element 1 when a voltage is applied thereto so as to displace the bimorph element 1 in an opposite direction. Therefore, the opening closing operation of the blocking piece 122c of the lever member 122 can be quickly controlled. Fig. 27 shows still another embodiment wherein the present invention is applied to another coin processing apparatus. In this embodiment, a subsequent coin rolling stop arm mechanism and an opening closing arm mechanism are formed integrally to constitute an escape mechanism 160. The resultant assembly is driven by a bimorph element 1 so as to drop coins one by one toward the coin guide. An escape mechanism 160 has a substantially U shaped escape 161 which is pivotally supported by a shaft 161a, as shown in Fig. 28. The escape 161 is pivoted by the bimorph element 1 through an engaging portion 161b as a driving force transmission mechanism. A blocking plate 163a of an opening closing arm mechanism for opening closing a coin drop port 162 is integrally formed with a lower end of the escape 161. A subsequent coin rolling stop pin 165 is integrally formed with the upper end of the escape 161 through an arm 164. Reference numeral 165a denotes a window for moving the pin 165 in the guide and 166a and 166b, and 167a and 167b, permanent magnets mounted on the pin 165 and the blocking plate 163a, and on the opposing guide plate, respectively. With this construction, the bimorph element 1 is normally displaced in the With the above construction, when a voltage is applied to the bimorph element 1 such that a displacement along the With the above construction, coins are sequentially dropped one by one from the distal end coin upon operation of the escape mechanism 160. At the same time, the stop pin 165 integrally formed with the escape 161 prevents rolling of the subsequent coin. The insertion angle of the pin 165 and the force acting on the escape mechanism 160 will be briefly described. As shown in Fig. 31A, when the shaft 161a is perpendicular to a tangent of the coin when the pin 165 is inserted, no rotational force acts on the escape mechanism 160. Therefore, in order to pull the pin 165 held in the state in Fig. 29, a force generated by the bimorph element upon polarity switching must be constantly larger than the frictional force between the coin and the pin 165. As shown in Fig. 31B, when an angle α2 is an acute angle, a force for rotating the pin 165 which extends into the coin guide is supplied by weight of a coin, so that the pin 165 is not easily withdrawn as compared with the case wherein the angle α2 is the right angle. However, in either case, when a voltage is applied to the bimorph element 1 such that the element 1 is displaced in the As shown in Fig. 31C, when an angle α3 becomes an obtuse angle, the coin weight serves to withdraw the pin 165. In this case, when the number of subsequent coins is increased, the escape mechanism 160 may be pivoted in the direction indicated by the arrow against a frictional force between the coin and the pin 165 and a force of the bimorph element 1 along the When a voltage is applied to the bimorph element 1 so as to displace the element 1 in the As shown in Fig. 27, a line O O connecting the gravity points of the leading coin and the subsequent coin becomes preferably parallel to the downstream portion of the coin guide 115 so as to prevent upward movement when the second coin abuts against the first coin. Ratios of a length a1 to a3, and a length a2 to a length a3 can be properly selected to amplify the displacement of the bimorph element 1. Referring to Fig. 27, the escape mechanism 160 is directly controlled by the bimorph element. However, the escape mechanism 160 may be controlled through a am mechanism, a link mechanism or a lock mechanism. In the above embodiment, by using the magnet mechanism, each arm mechanism has a dynamically stable point in the vicinity of the displacement end position. Figs. 32 and 33 show still another embodiment of a coin processing apparatus according to the present invention. In this embodiment, the present invention is applied to a coin discrimination mechanism or coin drop mechanism. Referring to Figs. 32 and 33, reference numeral 251 denotes an opening closing am mechanism which has a blocking plate 251c at the distal end of an am 251b. This arm 251 is pivotally supported by a shaft 251a mounted along the coin guide 102. A U shaped groove mechanism 251d is arranged in the arm 251b to couple to the bimorph element. The opening closing am mechanism 251 is pivoted upon swinging of the bimorph element 1. With the above construction, when arrival of the coin is detected, the control circuit reference numeral 5 in Fig. 1 is controlled to apply a voltage to the bimorph element 1 so as to hold the plate 251c in the opened closed state. In this case, when the bimorph element 1 is held displaced in a direction indicated by arrow Figs. 34 to 36 show still another embodiment of the present invention applied to a coin return mechanism. Referring to Figs. 34 to 36, reference numeral 340 denotes a return door pivoted about a pivot shaft 340a. The door 340 is normally biased by a torsion coil spring 341 in a closed position in the same manner as the previous embodiment. An engaging piece 340b mounted at the upper end of the door 340 is selectively locked by a lock portion 323a constituting the lock mechanism at the distal end of the bimorph element 1. Coin dropping ports 342 formed at the terminals of coin storage guides 307A, 307B and 307C are closed by blocking pieces 309a, 309b and 309c, respectively. With this construction, when the bimorph element 1 is held displaced in a direction indicated by arrow When the return state of the coin K is detected by a sensor 329, the polarity of the voltage applied to the bimorph element is inverted again. As a result, the door 340 is locked again. In this embodiment, the bimorph element 1 is normally held displaced in the The above mentioned telephone set is often deenergized when it is held in the on hook state. In this case, a magnet mechanism may be used. Alternatively, a capacitor may be arranged to charge it with a predetermined voltage, so that the bimorph element 1 can be applied with a proper voltage as needed. Another method is proposed to open the door 430 when the telephone set is not used. After a coin is returned, the bimorph element 1 is displaced in the In the above embodiment, a large force will not act on the swinging direction of the bimorph element 1. When the coin is returned, the bimorph element 1 must be displaced in the Reference 343, 344 and 345 denote storage levers which are pivotally supported by shafts 343a, 344a and 345a and which are mounted at the terminals of the storage guides 307A, 307B and 307C, respectively. Coin drop guides 346A, 346B and 346C for guiding the coins to the safe are located below the storage levers 343, 344 and 345. Fig. 37 is an application example of a piezoelectric actuator using the bimorph element of the present invention. Referring to Fig. 37, the piezoelectric actuators are used in a discrimination mechanism 390, coin drop mechanisms 308A, 308B and 308C, and a coin return mechanism 309. The construction of the actuators and a circuit arrangement thereof have been sufficiently described, and a detailed description thereof will be omitted. Briefly speaking, piezoelectric actuator units each having a bimorph element are used in the discrimination mechanism 390 and the coin return mechanism 309 to drive lock mechanisms 390a, respectively. Piezoelectric actuator units each having a bimorph element are used in members 391a, 392a and 393a to drive escape mechanisms 360A to 360C to constitute the coin drop mechanisms 308A to 308C, respectively. Referring to Fig. 37, reference numeral 301 denotes a coin insertion port and 302, a coin guide for guiding coins K K10, K100 and K50 inserted from the coin insertion port 301. A coin detector 303 is arranged midway on the coin guide 302 to detect an insertion state of the coin and whether or not the inserted coin is authentic K10, K100, K50 in accordance with an outer diameter, a material and a thickness thereof. A discrimination mechanism 304 is arranged next to the coin detector 303 to discriminate counterfeit or unfit coins in accordance with the detection signal from the coin detector 303 and returns the counterfeit and unfit coins to the return port. Coin selector mechanisms 305 and 306 select the authentic coins K K10, K100 and K50 discriminated by the discrimination mechanism 304 and guided along the coin guide 302. This selection operation is performed in units of denominations of the authentic coins. The selected coins are guided to the coin drop guides 307A, 307B and 307C in units of denominations. The coin drop mechanisms 308A, 308B and 308C are formed at terminal portions of the coin drop guides 307A, 307B and 307C, respectively. The coin return mechanism 309 is arranged at the terminals of the coin drop guides 307A, 307B and 307C. The coin drop mechanisms 308A, 308B and 308C drop the coins in the safe, and the coin return mechanism 309 returns the coins to the return port. In the above description, three types of coins K K10, K100 and K50 are discriminated. Reference symbol K10 denotes a 10 coin K100, a 100 coin and K50, a 50 coin. In the coin processing apparatus having the construction described above, the opening closing of the discrimination mechanism 304 is controlled by a controller 312 operated in response to the output signal from the coin detector 303, and by a drive system Fig. 1 consisting of the drive input circuit 2, the polarity switching circuit 3, the control circuit 5, the constant voltage circuit 4 and the power source E In this case, sensors 329a and 329b are arranged at the output sides of the discrimination mechanism 390 and the coin drop mechanisms 308A to 308C to detect passage of the coins. When the controller 312 detects operation of the sensors 329a and 329b, the polarity switching circuit 3 switches the polarity of the voltage through the control circuit 5. The present invention is not limited to the embodiments described above. The shape and construction of the respective components can be arbitrarily changed and modified. According to the present invention, the piezo element need not be limited to the piezoceramic element, but can be extended to a ferroelectric material such as a polymeric resin having a piezoelectric effect. As described in detail, the present invention is applied to the coin processing apparatuses. However, the present invention may be used in a variety of applications so as to provide a drive unit for a known wire dot printer head a micropump of an ink jet printer, a relay, an optical switch or the like. The circuit shown in Fig. 1 generates a constant voltage. However, when the voltage V The operation of the circuit having the arrangement described above will be described hereinafter. Assume that a voltage at a terminal C is higher than the voltage V In Fig. 38, the transistors Tr1 and Tr2 may be replaced with Darlington connected PNP and NPN transistors. In this case, a more stable voltage can be obtained with low power.
