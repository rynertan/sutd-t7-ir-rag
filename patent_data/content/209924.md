## Description
NEW ANTI THROMBOSIS AGENT BASED ON GLYCOSAHINCGLYCAN, PROCESS FOR ITS PREPARATION, AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS. The invention relates to a new anti throsbosis agent based on a heterogeneous fixture of glycosaminoglycans and to processes for its preparation. The invention also relates to pharnaceutical coipositions which contain the said fixture The invention in particular relates to a glycosaminoglycan anti thronbosis agent having a high affinity for anti throwbin III AT III . It is known that certain mucopolysaccharides influence the clotting properties of blood. The best known sucopolysaccharide is heparin a heterogeneous mixture of glucosalnoglycans , which is used in the prophylaxis and treatment of venous thrombosis and throubo esbolisis. The anti throibosis action of heparin is based on the acceleration of the inhibition of blood coagulating factors by antithrombin III.A great problem in the use of heparin for the prevention and in the therapy of thronbosis and thrombo embolisms is the property of heparin to cause haecorrhaging The risk of haesorrhages can be reduced somewhat by optimising the dose, tanner and frequency of administration but the ratio of anti throibosis properties to haecorrhage inducing properties of heparin can barely be influenced. A further shortcowing of heparin is its rather short duration of action, so that for good prophylaxis a dose usually has to be adeinistered at least twice per twenty four hours. Various attempts have already been made to prepare improved heparin or to develop heparinoids having fmproved properties. Thus, for example, British patent publication 2,002,406 relates to an improved heparin consisting of an oligo heteropolysaccharide mixture having a molecular weight distribution of between 2000 and 5000 daltons, which mixture is obtained by depolymerisation of heparin or is isolated from the mother liquors of the normal preparation of heparin, after which the material thus obtained is additionally sulphated. The ratio of anti thrombosis action to anti coagulant action of the material thus obtained is supposed to be more advantageous than in the case of heparin. Various other improved heparins with a low molecular weight LMW heparins have already been prepared. See, for example, U.S.Patent Specifications 3,766,167, 4,281,108 4,303,651, 4,351,938, 4,396,762, 4,401,662, 4,401,758, 4,438,261 and 4,474,770. A heparinoid with improved properties is described in EP A 0,066,908. This product shows a significant dissociation between anti throabosis action and haemorrhagic action. A new anti thrombosis agent has now been found. which is a fraction of the product described in EP A 0,066,908 and exhibits high affinity for AT III. The product described in EP A 0,066,908 is hereinafter referred to as HEF and the new product as HA HEF. HA HEF also consists of a mixture of oligosaccharides and hetero polyvaccharideR glycosaminoglycans , which are built up of hexose derivatives, in the main glucuronic acid, iduronic acid, glucosamine and sulphated andlor acetylated derivatives thereof, with uronic acid derivatives and glucosamine derivatives alternating with one another. It is a white, amorphous powder having a mean molecular weight between 5000 D and 9000 D, more specifically between 6000 D and 8000D. determined relative to dextran by means of eel permeation chromatography. The product can contain a small quantity of chondroitin sulphuric acid max. 2X by weight and dermatansulphate max. 2X by weight .The galactosanine content is between 0 and 0.1 tmol g and is usually less than 0.075 ol g. The nitrogen content is between 2 and 3 by weight and is usually about 2.5X by weight the sulphur content is between 8 and 12X by weight and is usually 10 10.5X by weight the content of N sulphate groups in milliequivalents g is 1.2 1.6 the content of O sulphate groups in milliequivalents ig is 1.7 2.1 the content of carboxyl groups in milliequivalents g is between 1.6 and 2.0 the content of N acetyl groups in milliequivalentslg is between 0.3 and 0.6 the iduronic acid content in amolJg is between 12 and 1.4 and the glucuronic acid content in smolig is between 0.3 and 0.5. The pharmacological profile of HA HEF is characterised by 1 an anti clotting activity USP of less than 10 international units per ug lU mg and hence only e fraction usually less than 5 of that of heparin USP 2 an anti thrombin activity which is less than 5 of that of heparin USP 3 an anti X8 activity of 350 490 U og 2 to 3 times that of heparin USP 4 an anti thrombosis activity Umetsu model with an IDSo of about 0.2 to 0.4 mg kg i.v. 5 a benefit risk ratio which, surprisinglys is even more advantageous than that of HEF with respect to the anti thrombosis activity relative to the haenorrhagic activity and is 15 50 tines more advantageous than that of heparin USP and 6 a half life which is roughly equal to that of REF, which means that it is at least twice as long as that of heparin USP.Further the haemorrhagic activity of HA HFF increases only slightly over a large dosage range and is even lower than that of HEF, while the haemorrhagic activity of heparin USP at a dosage of 1 mgfkg i.v.is already clearly noticeable, and rapidly increases at higher dosages. This interesting profile makes HA HEF very suitable for the prophylaxis and treatment of venous thrombosis and thrombo emboliens, The product is, above all, particularly suitable for the prophylaxis of DVT deep vein thrombosis in patients who undergo, or have undergone, a hip operation. Low doses s.c. of heparin are ineffective for that purpose and higher doses are contra indicated because of the high risk of haemorrhaging. HA HEF appears not to have mutagenic or toxic properties, even at high doses up to 3200 anti Xa U kg dsy . HA REF can be obtained from HEF in various ways. A feature common to these methods of preparation is that HEF is brought into contact with AT III. The part of REF complexed with AT III is thereafter separated from the non complexed part, after which HA HEF is liberated from the complex obtained and is subsequently isolated The AT III used can be of human origin but also of animal origin, for example AT Ill isolated from cattle plasma. HA HEF can be prepared batchwise or with the aid of columns. For example, AT III can be added to a buffered pH 7.0 8.0 aqueous solution of HEF. The mixture is stirred for some time, preferably at an elevated temperature 37 C . The AT III complex formed is thereafter separated from HEF by ultrafiltration, gel permeation chromatography or ion exchange chromatography and is decomposed by means of a buffered salt solution, after which the HA REF is isolated. A more advantageous embodiment of this process is that in which the AT III is used covalently bonded to a carrier material, for example agarse or a suitable silica based carrier material. The complexed part of the REF is then simpler to separate from the noncomplexed part, for example by filtering off with suction on a glass filter. AT Ill covalently bonded to carrier material can also be used in column form, over which the HEF containing solution is then passed. In this method, the separation of complexed and non complexed HEF is even simpler. A solution of HEF, buffered to a pH of between 7 and 8 with an acetate, phosphate or TRIS HC1 buffer is passed over an AT III column which has beforehand been equilibrated with the same buffer.HA HEF is bonded to the column. After the column has been washed,HA HEF is eluted from the column by means of a salt solution, for example a 1 3 oolar solution of LiCl, NaCl or Call2. The eluate is desalinated by dialysis or ultrafiltration and the HA HEF is isolated by methanol precipitation or freese drying. The methods of preparation mentioned are known per se for heparin. See, in this context, for example U.S. Patent Specifications 4,119,774 and 4,301,153. See also, for example, FEBS letters 66 1976 , 90 93 and Biochem. and Biophys. Res Come. 69 1976 , 570 577. Whenever heparin is treated in this manner, a heparin fraction with high affinity for AT III HA heparin is obtained. The yield ofHA heparin is about 25 35X by weight. In the case of HA HEF from REF, the yield is about 2 7X by weight. HA heparin has an anti clotting activity USP which is 2 3 times as great as that of heparin. In the case HA HEF, this activity is hardly altered compared to that of HEF. The anti Xa activity of HA heparin is about twice that of heparin. HA REF, hovever, has an anti Xa activity which is 30 100 times as great as that of HEF. The benefit risk ratio with respect to the anti thrombosis activity relative to the haemorrhagic activity is found to be little different for HA heparin from that of heparin, in other wordsHA heparin retains the unfavourable haemorrhage inducing properties of heparin. The benefitfrisk ratio of HA HEF is, however, found to be even more advantageous than that of REF. The new HA HEF can be converted, in the manner customary for heparin, to a pharmaceutical dosage form, for example by dissolution in water suitable for injection purposes, to which, if desired, pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliaries preservative. and certain salts can be added. Clinical use is by subcutaneous or intravenous if appropriate, intermittent injection or by infusion. Other dosage methods, such as intrapulmonary administration via spray inhalation, or administration via the skin by means of an ointment or cream, or via mucous membranes, for example by means of a suppository, are also possible. The invention is illustrated by the examples and tests which follow, without these implying any limitation. Example 1Preparation of iwmobilised AT III on a silica based carrier material 10 gll of purified heparin were added to a buffered solution of cattle AT III 10 mglml 0.1 H phosphate buffer, pH 7.8 and thereafter 300 gll of a silica based carrier material, as described in EP A 0,043,159 and containing N hydroxysuccinimide groups, were added.The mixture was stirred for 16 hours at room tenperature, and the carrier material was filtered off and washed with 0.1 N phosphate buffer pH 7.8 and subsequently with 0.1 H ethanolatine. Thereafter the material was incubated for S hours with ethanolamine 0.1 M at 0 5 C, again washed with 0.1 N phosphate buffer pH 7.8 and subsequently treated with 3M NaCl in 0.1 M phosphate buffer to remove the heparin. Example 2Preparation of HA HEF A column of the immobilised AT III obtained according to Example 1 was equilibrated with an 0.02 M phosphate buffer pH 7.4 . A buffer solution of HEF 20 g l was passed through this column 50 ml per litre of column material . The column was then washed with 0.02 M NH4 acetate buffer pH 8.0 for 1 hour and then with 0.4 N NaCl in the same buffer, again for one hour. Thereafter the column was eluted with 0.02 N NH4 acetate buffer pH 8.0 containing 3 N of NaCl. The eluate was desalinated and at the same time concentrated to a concentration of at least 10 mglml by means of a hollow fibre ultrafiltration device.The HA HEF was precipitated from the concentrated solution by means of 75X methanol. Yield 3.6X by weight. The HA HEF obtained had a mean molecular weight of 7100 D, a sulphur content of 10.3X by weight and a nitrogen content of 2.45 by weight, and contained 1.36 milliequivalentaig of N sulphate, 1.87 milliequivalentslg of 0 sulphate, 1.75 milliequivalents g of carboxyl, 0.422 williequivalents g of N acetyl, 1.33 mmol g of iduronic acid. 0.42 mmol g of glucuronic acid and 0.07 micllg of galactosatine. Example 3Preparation of HA HEF A column of AT III immobilised on agarose gel matrix was equillbrated with 0.05 N TRIS HC1 0.1 N NaCl buffer pH 7.5 . A solution of HEF 20 g l in the same buffer was passed through this column 50 ml per litre of column material . The column was then washed with the above mentioned buffer. Thereafter it was eluted with 0.05 N TRIS HC1 buffer containing 1 n CaCl2 pH 7.2 . The eluate was desalinated by gel filtration over a dextran gel matrix colurn and the salt free solution obtained was freeze dried. The HA HEF obtained had a mean molecular weight of 6600 D, a sulphur content of 10.1 by weight and a nitrogen content of 2.35 by weight, and contained 1.31 milliequivalents g of N sulphate, 1.82 nilliequivalentslg O sulphate, 1.78 milliequivalentelg of carboxyl, 0.403 milliequivalentsXg of N acetyl, 1.29 mmol g of iduronic acid, 0.47 mmollg of glucuronic acid and 0.04 nmollg of galactosamine.Pharmacological tests The HA HEF of Example 2 was tested pharmacologically in comparison with HEF prepared according to Example 3 of EP A 0,06X,908 , heparin and HA heparin.Effect on blood clotting Anti Anti Anti Xa Product clotting thrombin activity activity activity IUImg IU mg IUImg HA HEF 5 1 370HEF 3 0.2 8 heparin 175 161 166HA heparin 370 437 284 The anti clottlng activity was determined in accordance with theUSP method.
