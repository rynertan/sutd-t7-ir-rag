The price tag holding device 13, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3, comprises a price tag holder 15 for supporting a price tag 14 on its upper surface, and an adjusting member 16 for adjusting the holding position of the price tag 14.Side plates 17 stand upright on both sides of the rear end of the price tag holder 15. Engaging pins 18 are arranged in opposition at the inner surfaces of the side plates 17. A locking member 19 with an inclined top surface is formed integrally with the rear end of the holder 15. Both front corners of the holder 15 are slightly recessed to form attaching grooves 20 for the adjusting member 16, and to the inside of the holder 15 are formed a pair of slots 21. An indexing recess 22 with ribs and grooves is formed at substantially the center of the lower surface of the price tag holder 15. Numeral 23 denotes a price tag pushing spring whose rear end is securely fixed to the holder 15.Cross sectionally L shaped hooks 24 stand upright from both side edges of the adjusting member 16, and standing upright to the inside of them are locating projections 25 which are slidably engageable in the slots 21. A spring flap 26 protrudes from the center of the rear side of the adjusting member 16 and a pointed locking projection 27 stands upright at its rear end. The adjusting member 16 is mounted to the price tag holder 15 by engaging the locating projections 25 with the slots 21 of the price tag holder 15, engaging the locking projection 27 with the indexing recess 22, and engaging the hooks 24 with the attaching grooves 20. The adjusting member 16 may be held at a desired position with respect to the holder 15 by locating the locking projection 27 in a suitable groove of the indexing recess 22.The price tag holding device 13 comprising the combination of a price tag holder 15 and and adjusting member 16, is mounted to a bottom cover 28 of the label printing machine in this embodiment. The bottom cover 28 is pivotably mounted to be coaxial with the applying roller 12. Elongate grooves 29 engageable with the engaging pins 18 of the price tag holder 15 are formed as guiding means in the side plates. Narrowed locking sections 30 and 31 are formed E t both ends of the elongate grooves 29 for locking the engaging pins 18 in the front end locking sections 30, as shown in Figs. 1 and 4, when the price tag holding device 13 is in use and for sliding the pins 18 backward in the elongate grooves 29 to be locked in the rear end locking sections 31 when the price tag holding device 13 is not in use.A wedge shaped stopper 32 is securely fixed to the lower surface of the bottom cover 28 near the rear end locking sections 31.The mode of operation of the correction label applying device of the present invention will be described.Prices and other information are generally printed in several rows on tag cards such as price tags and ticket.For correcting part of such information, the price tag holding device 13 is located at a predetermined position of the label printing machine as shown inFig. 1.The price tag holding device 13 located at the rear side as shown bg the two dot chain lines in Fig. 4 when not in use, is lightly pressed forth with holding portions 33 on both its sides. Then, the engaging pins 18 which have been locked in the rear end locking sections 31 of the elongate grooves 29 of the bottom cover 28 are released from the locking sections 31. The pins 18 are slid along the elongate grooves 29 to displace the price tag holding device 13 forward, and the pins 18 are locked in the front end locking sections 30 of the elongate grooves 29.The printing heads 6a and 6b of the label printing machine are operated subsequently to align the pre determined printing types in the printing position.The end portion of the price tag 14 to be corrected is inserted from the upper front of the price tag holding device 13 to below the price tag pushing spring 23, as shown in Fig. 3. The price tag 14 is finally positioned at a predetermined position when notches 14a Fig. 5 formed at both side edges of the price tag 14 engage with the locating projections 25 of the adjusting member 16.When one series of squeezing and releasing operations of the hand lever 4 of the label printing machine is performed, the label piece 11 with right printing is separated from the backing paper 10 and is fed out below the applying roller 12. When the price tag holding device 13 is pressed toward the applying roller by being pivoted in the direction of the arrow A inFig. 4, i.e., in the clockwise direction, by pressing the front lower end of the label printing machine to a worktable or the like or pressing upward the price tag holding device 13 with a finger, the price tag 14 and the label piece 11 are clamped between the applying roller 12 and the upper surface of the price tag holder 15 so that the front end of the label piece 11 is applied at the predetermined position of the price tag 14.When the price tag 14 is pulled forward under this condition, the rear side of the label piece 11 is also applied to the price tag 14 by the applying roller 12, and the correction of the printing is completed Fig. 5 A . When it is desired to change the correcting position of the price tag 14 as shown in Fig. 5 B , the adjusting member 16 is slid with respect to the price tag holder 15 gripping holding portions 34 at both sides of the adjusting member 16 to lock the locking pro jection 27 with another groove of the indexing recess 22 of the holder 15. Then, the positions of the locating projections 25 change and the holding position of the price tag 14 also change so that the applying position of the label piece 11 may be changed.When the correcting operation of the price tag 14 is completed according to the above operation, the price tag holding device 13 is lightly pressed backward gripping the holding portions 33. Then, the engaging pins 18 are released from the front end locking sections 30 of the elongate grooves 29.The price tag holding device 13 is pressed backward to slide the engaging pins 18 along the elongate grooves 29. When the pins 18 draw near the rear ends of the elongate grooves 29, the inclined top surface of the locking member 19 at the rear end of the price tag holder 15 comes into contact and fits with the inclined surface of the stopper 32 at the lower surface of the bottom cover 28.When the price tag holding device 13 is pressed further toward the back, the engagement of the stopper 32 with the locking member 19 is reinforced, and the locking pins 18 are locked in the rear end locking sections 31 of the elongate grooves 29. Due to this, the position of the price tag holding device 13 is fixed as shown by the two dot chain lines of Fig. 4. In this case, since the front end of the price tag holding device .13 isSecurely fixed to the bottom cover 28 by the inclined surface of the stopper 32, the price tag holding device 13 will not swing at the lower surface of the label printing machine without interfering with normal label applying work. Although the price tag holding device 13 is attached to the bottom cover 28 of the label printing machine in the above embodiment, the present invention is not limited to this particular construction. The price tag holding device 13 may be, for example, mounted to the machine frame 1 or the like. The guiding means of the price tag holding device 13 is not limited to the elongate grooves 29, but other guiding means may be adopted such as elongate holes or guide rails.As the price tag holding device, one may be used which is usable with price tags without side notches 14a, such as one with a stopper for price tag positioning at the front end of the adjusting member, as disclosed in the above mentioned European patent application 79 101 252.9, or one which is capable of adjusting the position of the guides on the side edges according to the width of the price tag. In summary, with the correction label applying device of the present invention, the price tag holding device attached to the label printing machine need not be detached from the machine when not in use, but may be moved to another position of the label printing machine to be locked and securely fixed there.Thus, it is not necessary to attach and detach the price tag holding device every time it is used, and therefore the price tag holding device may not be lost, so that the correction of the price tags may be performed quickly and smoothly.Although the present invention has been described in connection with a preferred embodiment thereof, many variations and modifications will now become apparent to those skilled in tie art. It is preferred, there fore, that the present invention be limited not by the specific disclosure herein, but only by the appended claims.
