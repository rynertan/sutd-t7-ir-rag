# Reversible gear pump or motor and diverter plates therefor.

## Abstract
A reversible gear pump or motor capable of sustained operation under unusually high pressure conditions is pro vided with a diverter plate 36 having pressure transmitting paths 96a, 96b in the ends of the plate which open to the gear teeth 10a, 10b on both the high and low pressure sides of the pump. In operation, the outlet pressure is transmitted through the specially formed paths to areas of the gears 10, 12 on the low pressure side. The pressure acts as a counter force which pushes the gears 10, 12 towards a centered position and reduces bearing loads.
