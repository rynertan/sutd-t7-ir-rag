# A PLASMID AND ITS MICROBIOLOGICAL PREPARATION

## Abstract
A novel chemical compound, essentially pure plasmid pUC10, which is obtainable from a biologically pure culture of the microorganism Streptomyces erythreus. Specifically exemplified herein is the obtention of plasmid pUC10 from S. erythreus NRRL 2338. The pUC10 plasmid is useful as a clon ing vehicle in recombinant DNA work. For example, using DNA methodology, a desired gene, for example, the insulin gene, can be inserted into pUC10 and the resulting plasmid can then be transformed into a suitable host microbe which, upon cul turing, produces the desired insulin.
