## Description
The present invention relates to a mixing method of reaction materials and a mixing apparatus for using it. Especially, they may be used in a dispenser for two liquid mixture type bonding agent, apparatuses of vacuum injection type, reactivity injection molding or the like. In the production line of the appliance using the two liquid mixture type bonding agent including, for example, the ambient temperature hardening type expoxide resin and its hardening agent, the operator mixed, in the batch processing, the epoxide resin and its hardening agent through the manual handling. He scooped a small amount of mixture with the tip of a narrow piece for application use such as needle or toothpick and applied it on a given location for bonding operation. However, after the two liquid mixture, the harden ing reaction of the epoxide resin was advanced by the open ring of the epoxide group and the reaction with the func tional group of the hardening agent with the hydroxyl group. It became difficult to scoop the mixture to apply it, so that most of the mixture was discarded. Also, the automatic dispenser adapted the two liquid mixing method represented by the static division mixture using the split plate or the split blade. However, the static mixer using the conventional static division mixing method required some extent of liquid amount for mixing operation, so that it was unsuitable to precisely mix, discharge the micro amount. Also, the gelatin condition before the hardening operation was unsuitable for the mixture supply of materials of minute order or less. Further, even in the mixture of the material which was capable of maintaining the gelatin condition for several tens of minutes, the washing operation was required to remove the mixture attached on the mixer, the split blades or the like. Also, an apparatus which introduces raw materials into a given container, and compulsorily stirs the raw materials by variously shaped blade type forced stirring apparatus, an apparatus which causes the raw materials to collide against each other under the high pressure within the given narrow container to mix them, or the like is used as the mixing apparatus. However, the mixing apparatus using the blade type of forced stirring apparatus has more material loss, because the remaining amount of the mixture liquid is large because of more void. Also, the washing operation is required with gas or washing liquid, a large amount of washing gas or washing liquid are required for sufficient washing operation. Furthermore, the remaining washing liquid deteriorates the matter property after the hardening of the raw materials mixed thereafter, thus causing problems of production cost, production stability. Also, the collision mixing apparatus is suitable for the mixing of the liquid of low viscosity, but is not suitable for sufficient mixing of the raw materials, of high vis cosity, mixed with bulking agent, is not suitable for correct mixing of small amount of raw materials without embracing air bubbles, furthermore requires a high pressure producing source such as hydraulic or the like. Accordingly, an essential object of the present invention is to solve the above described problems, to precisely perform the mixing ratio, the dispersion for sufficient mixing of reaction materials, of high viscosity, which is capable of mixing especially if small in amount, includes bulking agent. Another important object of the present invention is to provide a mixing method suitable for mixing the reaction materials of several minute order in a gelatin condition. A further object of the present invention is to provide a mixing apparatus which will do even if the dis carded raw materials are smaller in amount in the mixing and the use amount of the washing liquid after the mixing is smaller. The present invention is a mixing method of reaction materials composed of a plurality of liquid. The mixing methods of the reaction raw materials comprising the steps of relatively rotating the rotating shaft having spiral grooves of one line or more and a plurality of raw material discharge openings formed around the rotary shaft, of scratching, introducing into the grooves of the rotary shaft the raw materials alternately from the plural ity of discharge openings, of mixing the reaction raw materials of the plurality of liquid. Further, to ensure the mixing operation, this method comprises the steps of releasing into the mixing space the raw materials of a plurality of liquid scratched into the grooves and stirring them, mixing the reaction materials of a plurality of liquid. Further, it is preferable to retain, control the temperature of the mixing portion into the temperature for extending the gelatin condition time of the reaction raw material for the mixing operation. Also, an apparatus for embodying the mixing method is provided with a rotary shaft having grooves of one line or more on the outer peripheral face, a cylinder having the shaft through longitudinally, a pressure transfer means for sending the reaction raw materials into the grooves of the outer peripheral face of the rotary shaft within the cylin der from a plurality of raw material tanks, a driving means for rotating the rotary shaft. The rotation shaft is axially movable, the rotation shaft is adapted to assume the condition where it is exposed externally of the cylinder. Thus, the mixing head may be provided which does not require the washing liquid with the precise mixing and after the mixing, and may be wiped externally. Also, in addition to the above construction, a temperature control means is provided which is capable of pressure transferring the reaction materials and of temperature adjusting the required portions of the mixing route. By the use of the above described means, one type of raw material is discharged, fed while the raw material discharge opening conforms with the groove of the rotation shaft through the rotation of the rotation shaft, another type of raw material is in the next discharge opening discharged fed into the groove. When the revolution number of the shaft is rotated at the high speed of about 100 through 3200 rpm by the repetition of it, the raw material is fed, filled into fine layers and is mixed. Thus, the precise mixing may be performed by the shearing force between the grooves of the shaft and the cylinder wall face. Furthermore, a plurality of liquid raw materials within the grooves are released into the mixing space for stirring operation so that they are mixed more sufficiently. When the number of revolutions is fast, the raw materials to be mixed are two liquids or more, the strong shearing forces work between the shaft grooves and the cylinder wall face, so that the sufficient mixing is performed even without the stirring in the raw material releasing condition for further reaction. Also, if the rotation shaft is moved after the continuous injection of the given mixture and the rotation shaft is projected, released externally of the cylinder, the raw materials remaining in the grooves may be wiped out, thus allowing the mixing apparatus to be easily washed, which was conventionally difficult to perform. As described hereinabove, according to the present invention, the new reaction raw materials are normally fed into the grooves without the air bubbles beings embraced in the mixture when the mixture is continuously discharged, the mixture may be stably fed more than five times the gelatin condition time to achieve the washing operation of the grooves. Also, in the present apparatus, the mixture portion is controlled in temperature with respect to the reaction raw materials into the temperature of about several hours or more in the gelatin condition time, so that it may be continuously used during the eight hour labor. Also, another invention of the present application is to provide a mixed head suitable for the mixing of the reaction raw materials which has only several tens of gelatin condition time, and are fast in the hardening speed. Thus, the washing method is to improve the sufficient mixing method. Namely, in the mixing apparatus wherein the rota tion shaft having grooves of one line or more, a plurality of raw material discharge openings formed around the rotary shaft are relatively rotated to feed, mix into the grooves the raw materials of two types or more from the raw material discharge openings, the washing openings for feeding the washing fluid are provided in the position deviated in the axial direction of the rotation shaft with respect to the raw material discharge openings, means for moving the rotation shaft in the axial direction so that the grooves of the rotation shaft conform with the raw material discharge openings during the raw material discharge operation, the portions of the rotation shaft wherein the grooves are not provided conform with the raw material discharge openings, and the grooves conform with the washing openings. In this case, the mixture flows into the grooves into the rotary shaft, the washing fluid flows into the same locations, so that the washing operation may be completely performed for a short time in second unit. Also, during the washing opera tion, the raw material discharge openings are blocked in the portions, without grooves, of the shaft, the washing liquid and the washing gas do not reach onto the side of the raw materials within the tank, also the small remaining capacity of the washing liquid will do. Thus, if the remaining liquid is discarded after the completion of the washing operation, the stable reaction may be retained. It is convenient to rotate the rotation shaft for the intro duction passage into the grooves of the washing liquid and the discording of the remaining liquid. Thus, during the washing operation, the rotation shaft moves into the direc tion of the injection opening, the discharge openings of the raw materials come into contact against the portion of the rotation shaft where no grooves are provided. The washing fluid from the washing discharge openings is quickly dis charged from the injection opening without the flowing onto the side of the raw material discharge opening.

Similarly, the raw material B is fed into the groove in the next discharge opening 5 so that the scraping portion 10 of the raw material A and the scraping portion 11 of the raw material B are scraped into the groove 7 in the prag shape and the layer shape and are filled as shown in Fig. 2. While this operation is repeated, the raw materials are sufficiently mixed, receiving the shearing force through the viscous resistance between the cylinder and the raw materi als within the groove. The raw materials reach the tip end portion of the rotary shaft 1, are released into the mixing space 9, and are precisely mixed by the stirring operation. The unit amount of the scraping portions 10 and 11 are provided in micro amount in terms or rotation shaft thick ness, revolution number per unit time, groove depth, raw material viscosity, pressure to be applied upon the raw materials to allow the precise mixing operation in micro amount to be performed. Also, the sufficient mixing operation may be achieved, without releasing stirring operation through the faster rotation of the rotation shaft, more increased shearing force to be caused between the shaft and the cylinder peripheral wall. Further, the timing adjustment of the pressure feeding is added to control the total mixture discharging amount from the nozzle main body 2. Also, in the construction of the present embodi ment, the rotation shaft 1 may be easily exposed externally of the cylinder 2a by the movement, as shown in Fig. 1B, of the rotation shaft 1 in the condition of Fig. 1A in the axial direction, so that the washing operation may be easily performed by the wiping operation of the grooves 7. Also, a semiconductor thermo module is disposed in the mixing portion, the portion is cooled to 5 C or lower so that the gelatin condition time to the hardening may be extended from three minutes to about two hours. The continuous injection may be performed in the mixing apparatus by the rotation shaft composed of the drill through the above described construction, the mixing discharging of the room temperature hardening type expoxide bonding agent which does not have about three minutes or five minutes gelatin condition time may be continuously performed in a method of externally releasing the drill, after the given continuous injection, to wipe out the remaining raw materials from the groove.
