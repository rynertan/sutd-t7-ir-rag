## Description
DESCRIPTION TRANSFORMER DIFFERENTIAL SAFETY SYSTEMS . The present invention relates to a transformer safety system intended to detect internal failures in the winding of a transformer such as insulation break dolm, short cIrcuIts, and so on. The chief purpose of the system is to take the transformer out of service when a failure arises, and above all to do so before such failure becomes serious, with a vie z to saving costs which might otherwise arise witch repairing same, and from this it can be seen that there are to impor tant properties that such a system must possess a reacting time, which should be as short as possibe, in order to arrest the development of the fault, and b sensitivity, where the relay should be sensitive in order to detect small defects, that is to say, at an early stage in their development, but nonetheless being sufficiently stable, so as not to trip inopportunely through reasons other than a defect, such as might be passing short circuits, voltage surges and so on. Present systems for fault detection use differential current measurement, where in principle I primary secondary, and K is a constant depending upon the transformation ratio, including both that of the transformer itself, as well as that of the instrument transformers. This ratio, which is in principle accurate, is not so under certain conditions, such as a over voltages which saturate the core and hence increase losses, thus distorting the transformation ratio, b external short circuits which saturate the instrument transformers, increasing the losses in the transformer, and thus likewise distorting the transformation ratio and c transient connection effects, and so on. In order te overcome the above effects, harmonic second filters require to be used, in order to achieve retarding that will prevent the safety equipment from tripping inopportunely. To all this must be added the choice of voltage regulating terminals as are provided on power transformers, because this can cause constant K to vary significantly. Owing to all the above considerations the actual insen sitivity displayed by present day safety systems varies between 30 รณ and 4to that is to say, failures are not detected until their current value is that much above the current in the circuit at the time, and due to thIs, the transformer has usually suffered serious damage by the time it is disconnected from the supply. The present invention endeavours to overcome this difficulty by the use of a new measuring system, based on a measurement of the active power which enters and leaves the transformer that is to say, it is a differential active power measurement, and this enables a theoretical sensitivity of close on 100 รณ to be achieved while in practice, due chiefly to inaccuracies in the instrument transformer, an insensitivity value of the order of 5 is obtained, even when voltage regulating terminals are included. The measurement taken on the basis of the active power, overcomes to a great extent those difficulties which arise in the current system, since no account needs to be taken of assumed losses caused by the reactive current, which are much greater than those caused by the active current, when evaluating the apparent current under transitory conditions. In the accompanying drawing, the sole Figure is the circuit diagram of an example of a system according to the invention, where notations as follows are used to show the items depicted therein 1.

Active copper losses.Pd. Power differential, where Pd Pp Psl Ps2 Pfe Pcu . The safety system being dealt with here is in accordance with the following equation Pp Ps Pfe Pcu 0 where Ps Secondary active power. Pp Primary active power. Pfe Active Iron losses. Pcu Active copper losses. Under normal operating conditions, this equality is maintained. When an internal defect arises, such as a shortcircuit between findings, etc., the fault which appears is resistive, and hence an increase in power results, this occurring in the primary active power Pp , and not in the secondary active power Ps , and so equality is no longer maIntaIned, whereupon tripping out takes place as soon as the value exceeds the primary active poser Ps hy v. The transformer differential safety system is comprised of nine active power converter units 4 arranged in groups of three for the transformer prImary 1 , secondary 2 and tertiary windings 3 and these three modules, together with their associated adding component 5 as may be seen from the accompanying diagram, evaluated Pp, Psl and Ps2. The equation applicable to the equipment is as folloxfs Power difference, Pd Pp Psl Ps2 Pfe Pcu . Therefore, Psl Ps2 is calculated by means of the adding component 5 and afterwards Pp is subtracted, and the sale applies to Pfe Pcu. Once this result has been obtained, it is compared by means of comparison component 6 , with the sensitivity threshold 9 as referred to the nominal power, and tripping occurs if the power differential Pd is greater. The following convention is used in order to cater for changes of si gn even when there is a change in the direction of the power flow All ingding power values to the transformer are positive, and all outgoing ones are negative. In this way, if there is a change in the direction of the power flow, the balance in the equation remains unaltered. hen the defect inside the transformer gives rise to a consumption by all the windings, the sign convention makes Pd power differential be the result of adding, and not subtracting, the ingoing powers, whereupon a tripping condition tends to be created, with respect to the evaluation of losses Pfe Pcu , this is performed in the calculation circuit 11 . Said losses can be compared to a vabe varying in accordance fith the square of the current, that is to say iI2 Pfe Pcu, where K is a constant of proportionality.Hence If the transformer is on permanent duty, there is no internal defect, and the currents are in phase, then by adding together the three R phase currents of the primary, secondary and tertiary windings, the total absolute value of all three is obtained. If the S phase currents, and the T phase currents are each added up in the same way, three current values in all will be obtained, which, when added together will give a current value which is proportional to the currents which are flowing in the transformer, and when this is squared, the result is a K12 value which is proportional to the losses. However, if because of some internal defect, a secondary or tertiary winding was consuming power, the currents of such winding would be out of phase by 1800, and when added up, the resulting value would be smaller. Hence, the power substracted for the active copper loses Pcu would be smaller, and a tripping condition would tend to be created. In this way, a retarding effect is achieved for passing short circuit conditions, during which time the copper losses increase sharply, and they decrease when the defect is an internal one. Due to its electronic nature, this system also includes a set of on design high dynamic current transformers to avoid the need to employ ratio adaptor transformers in a wide range of current values 5Q, where the 5Q adjustment is accomplished by potentiometers. The system is moreover fitted with an indicator system to assist with rating it, where luminescent diodes 10 and their associated circuit S are provided to attain the power balance condition under normal operation. This system is used for rating the transformer ratio adjustment potentiometers, thus simplifying the adjustment procedure of the equipment. The system covered by this invention clearly provides transformer safety of a kind which is not affected by the value of the transformer in question, and this, together with the advantages already specified, affords a safety system that is suitable for use in conjunction with variable transformation ratio transformers, without the need for any other components. In an alternative embodiment of the invention, not illustrated the functions of the active power converter units 4, the adding components 5 , the comparison component 6 and the active iron and copper loss calculation circuit 11 may be wholly or partially carried out by one or more suitably programmed microprocessors.
