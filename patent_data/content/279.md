# A process for removing organic carbonyl containing contaminants from a hydrocarbon product stream.

## Abstract
Carbonyl containing organic impurities are removed from organic hydrocarbons produced in conventional facilities. The process comprises contacting the hydrocarbon product with an aqueous solution containing a water soluble reducing agent in slightly greater amount than is theoretically required for complete reaction with the carbonyl compounds, in an in line mixing means, and then passing the mixture to a phase separator to separate the layers. The resulting scrubbed hydrocarbon product is substantially purified e.g., to as low as less than 2 ppm carbonyl compounds . An optional second mixer and scrubbing tower are provided as a back up system in case of surge conditions or maintenance of the first system.
