## Description
SKIN CLESCSTNn COMPOSITIONS The present invention relates to improvements in soap compositions for use on the skin. The improvements reside in the formulation of soap compositions which contain certain nitrogen based conditioning agents. These conditioning agents are salts wherein the cation moiety is a protonated fatty amine or a fatty quaternary ammonium ion and the anion moiety is the anion of a fatty acid soap or an anionic synthetic detergent. The conditioning agents are present at levels of from about 0.25 to 25 by weight in the composition. BACKGROUND ART The most commonly used agent for cleansing the skin is soap. It has long been recognized that the cleansing of the skin with soap tends to remove natural oils from the skin, thereby causing dryness and roughness as well as a sensation of discomfort in the skin. Dryness and roughness can be perceived tactually by rubbing one s fingers across the skin and will be referred to herein as external skin feel . Discomfort of the skin without touching perceived as skin tension or tightness is felt internally by the person whose skin has been cleansed with soap and will be referred to herein as internal skin feel .This internal feel is most readily perceived immediately after washing and drying of the skin. There have been many attempts to alleviate the adverse skin effects caused by soap, by incorporating into soap compositions a variety of mildness additives. These have included vegetable oils, mineral oils, free fatty acids, fatty acid esters of polyols, and the like. While these materials tend to alleviate the negative effects of soap upon the skin, there is a continuing need for improved skin conditioners to be used with soap. She object of the present invention is to provide soap compositions which are effective in cleansing the skin and are highly effective in alleviating the adverse effects on skin feel especially external skin feel which normally accompany the use of soap on the skin. DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION According to the present invention, it has been found that certain salts wherein the cation moiety is a protonated fatty amine or a fatty quaternary ammonium ion, and the anion moiety is the anion of a fatty acid soap or an anionic synthetic detergent are effective in alleviating the adverse effects on external skin feel caused by washing the skin with soap. The present invention encompasses skin cleansing compositions which comprise a. from about 3 to about 95 by weight of a soap selected from the group consisting of alkali metal salts of fatty acids containing from about 8 to about 20 carbon atoms and mixtures of said soaps and b. from about 0.25 to about 25 of a skin conditioning agent selected from compounds having the formulas EMI2.1 EMI3.1 therein R1 R2 R3 and R4 are each selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and aliphatic hydrocarbyl groups containing from 1 to about 24 carbon atoms, with at least one of R1, R2, R3 and R4 being an aliphatic hydrocarbyl group containing from about 8 to about 24 carbon atoms, wherein R , R7, R7, R8 and are each selected from the group consisting, of hydrogen and aliphatic hydrocarbyl groups containing from 1 to about 24 carbon atoms with at least one of R5, R6, R7, R8 and Rg being an aliphatic hydrocarbyl group containing from about 8 to about 24 carbon atoms, wherein R107 Rill, R12, R131 R14 and 15 are each selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and C1 to C24 aliphatic hydrocarbyl groups with at least one of R101 R11 R12, R13 14 and R15 being an aliphatic hydrocarbyl group containing from about 8 to about 24 carbon atoms, wherein R16, h R17 and R18 are each selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and aliphatic hydrocarbyl groups containing from about 1 to about 24 carbon atoms, with at least one of R16, R17 and R18 being an aliphatic hydrocarbyl group containing from about 8 to about 24 carbon atoms, wherein Rl9, R20r R21 and R22 are each selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and aliphatic hydrocarbyl groups containing from 1 to about 24 carbon atoms, with at least one of R19, R20 R21 and R22 being an aliphatic hydrocarbyl group containing from about 8 to about 24 carbon atoms, wherein n is an integer of from 1 to about 20, wherein m is an integer of from 2 to about 20, and wherein A is an anion which is selected from the group consisting of the anions of fatty acid soaps and anionic synthetic detergents.The term hydrocarbyl as used herein refers to a radical which consists of hydrogen and carbon atoms All percentages herein are by weight unless specified otherwise. THE SOAP COMPONENT The soap component of the present compositions is an alkali metal e.g., sodium or potassium soap or mixture of soaps of fatty acids containing from about 8 to about 24, preferably from about 10 to 20 carbon atoms. The fatty acids used in making the soaps can be obtained from natural sources such as, for instance, plant or animal derived glycerides e.g., palm oil, coconut oil, babassu oil, soybean oil, castor oil, tallow, whale oil, fish oil, tallow, grease, lard and mixtures thereof . The fatty acids can also be synthetically prepared e.g., by oxidation of petroleum stocks or by the Fischer Tropsch process . Alkali metal soaps can be made by direct saponification of the fats and oils or by the neutralization of the free fatty acids which are prepared in a separate manu fracturing process. Particularly useful are the sodium and potassium salts of the mixtures of fatty acids derived from coconut oil and tallow, i.e., sodium and potassium tallow and coconut soaps. The term tallow is used herein in connection with fatty acid mixtures which typically have an approximate carbon chain length distribution of 2.5 C14, 29 C16, 23 C18, 2 palmitoleic, 41.5 oleic and 3 linoleic the first three fatty acids listed are saturated . Other mixtures with similar distribution, such as the fatty acids derived from various animal tallows and lard, are also included within the term tallow. The tallow can also be hardened i.e., hydrogenated to convert part or all of the unsaturated fatty acid moieties to saturated fatty acid moieties. When the term coconut oil is used herein it refers to fatty acid mixtures which typically have an approximate carbon chain length distribution of about 8 C8, 7 C1O, 48 C12 17 C14, 9 C16, 2 C18, 7 oleic, and 2 linoleic the first six fatty acids listed being saturated . Other sources having similar carbon chain length distribution such as palm kernel oil and babassu kernel oil are included with the term coconut oil When compositions of the present invention are prepared in the form of toilet barst the soap component is preferably either sodium soap or a mixture of sodium and potassium soap wherein the mixture contains no more than about 25 by weignt potassium soap. Also, it is preferable in such bars that the total soap component comprises a from about 20 to 80 by weight of the soap component of a mixture containing soaps having from 8 to 14 carbon atoms and b from about 20 to 80 by weight of the soap component of soaps having from about 16 to 20 carbon atoms. Soaps having such preferred chain length distribution characteristics can be realized by utilizing mixtures of tallow and coconut fatty acids in tallow coconut weight ratios varying between 90 10 and 50 50. The soap compositions herein can also contain free fatty acids having carbon chain lengths of from about 8 to 18. The presence of such free fatty acids tends to improve the speed and volume of lathering of the composition and confers a creamy feel to the lather. When free fatty acids are utilized in the compositions herein, they are generally present at levels of from about 5 to about 25 of the total amount of soap. Toilet bars containing the above described soap mixtures, as well as their manufacture, are described in more detail in Megson et al, U.S. Patent No. 3,576,749, issued April 27, 1971, and White, U.S. Patent No. 3,835,058, issued September 10, 1974. Both of these patents are incorporated herein by reference. THE SKIN CONDITIONING COMPONENT The skin conditioning component of the present compositions is selcted from the group of compounds having the formulas EMI7.1 EMI8.1 wherein R1, R2, R3 and R4 are each selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and aliphatic hydrocarbyl groups containing from 1 to about 24 carbon atoms, with at least one of R1, R2, R3 and R4 being an aliphatic hydrocarbyl group containing from about 8 to about 24 carbon atoms, wherein R5, Rs, R7, R8 and Rg are each selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and aliphatic hydrocarbyl groups containing from 1 to about 24 carbon atoms with at least one of R5, R6, R7, R8 and Rg being an aliphatic hydrocarbyl group containing from about 8 to about 24 carbon atoms, wherein R10, R111 R12, 13 R14 and R15 are each selected from the group consisting of hydrogen andC1 to C24 aliphatic hydrocarbyl groups with at least one of R10, R11, R12 R13, R14 and R15 being an aliphatic hydrocarbyl group containing from about 8 to about 24 carbon atoms, wherein R16, R17 and R18 are each selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and aliphatic hydrocarbyl groups containing from 1 to about 24 carbon atoms, with at least one of R16, R17 and R18 being an aliphatic hydrocarbyl group containing from about 8 to about 24 carbon atoms, wherein R191 R20, R21 and R22 are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and aliphatic hydrocarbyl groups containing from 1 to about 24 carbon atoms, with at least one of Rl9, R20, R21 and R22 being an aliphatic hydrocarbyl group containing from about 8 to about 24 carbon atoms, wherein n is an integer of from 1 to about 20 preferably from 1 to about 4 , wherein m is an integer of from 2 to about 20 preferably 2 to 4 and wherein A is an anion which is selected from the group consisting of the anions of fatty acid soaps and anionic synthetic detergents. These skin conditioning compounds are salts. The cation moiety of the salt is a protonated fatty amine or protonated imidazoline moiety or a quaternary ammonium or imidazolinium moiety. For example, in Formula I, whenone or more of the R groups is hydrogen, the cation is a protonated amine moiety. If all four R groups are hydrocarbyl groups, the cation is a quaternary ammonium moiety. Amines can be protonated by reacting them with an acidic material e.g., HC1 or acetic acid . The resulting compound is a protonated amine salt, e.g., an amine hydrochloride or an amine acetate. Amines which are protonated to provide cation moieties for the present invention can be primary, secondary or tertiary amines, and must contain at least one aliphatic hydrocarbyl group of from 8 to 24 carbon atoms. Examples of such amines are dodecylamine, methyl octadecyl amine, dimethyl .hexadecyl.amine,. didodecyl methyl amine, ethyl dodecyl octadecyl amine, N tetradecyl,N propyl 1,3 propane diamine, l stearylamidoethyl 2 stearyl imidazoline and ethylene bis 2 stearyl imidazoline .Examples of protonated amine salts formed from these amines are dodecylamine acetate, methyl octadecyl amine hydrochloride, dimethyl hexadecylamine hydrochloride, didodecyl methyl amine acetate,ethyl dodecyl octadecyl amine acetate,N tetradecyl, N propyl 1,3 propane diamine dihydrochloride, l stearylamidoethyl 2 stearyl imidazolinium hydrochloride and ethylene bis 2 stearylimi.dazolinium dihydrochioride. Such amine salts can be used to provide the protonated amine moiety which can serve as the cation of the skin conditioning agents of the present invention. The quaternary ammonium ions are the cations which are formed by quaternizing a tertiary aliphatic amine with an additional aliphatic group. This is accomplished by reacting a tertiary amine with an alkylating agent such as methyl chloride. For example if didodecyl methyl amine is reacted with methyl chloride, the resulting quaternary ammonium salt is didodecyldimethylammonium chloride.Examples of specific quaternary ammonium salts which can be used to provide the quaternary ammonium cation moiety for the skin conditioning agents herein are didodecyldimethylammonium chloride, dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide, dibexadecyldimethylammonium acetate, N,N ditetradecyl N1 N,N ,N tetramethyl 1,3 propyl diammonium dichloride, N,N distearyl N,N,N ,N tetramethyl l,10 decyl diammonium acetate, l methyl l stearylamidoethyl 2 stearyl tnidazolinium methyl sulfate and ethylene bis 2 stearyl, l methylimidazolinium dichloride. The conditioning agents of the present invention are prepared by simple reaction between a protonated amine or imidazoline salt e.g., hydrochloride or a quaternary ammonium or imidazolinium salt, and a fatty acid soap or an anionic synthetic detergent. For example EMI10.1 EMI11.1 In the case where the cationic moiety is a protonated amine or imidazoline, the conditioning agent can also be prepared by reacting the free amine or imidazoline with a fatty acid instead of a soap or the acid form of the synthetic detergent instead of the salt form of the detergent . For example EMI11.2 The anionic moiety of the skin conditioning agent herein can be the anionofafatty acid soap i.e., the radicalEMI12.1 wherein R23 is a C7 to C23 aliphatic group or the anion of an anionic synthetic detergent.Any atonic synthetic detergent can be used to provide the anion moiety for the skin conditioning agents herein. The most common types of anionic synthetic detergents are the water soluble salts e.g., sodium, potassium, lithium or ammonium of organic sulfuric reaction products having in their molecule an aliphatic group containing from about 8 to about 24 carbon atoms, and a sulfonic or sulfuric acid ester radical. Synthetic detergents containing a C8 to C24 aliphatic group and having a carboxylic acid radical instead of a sulfonic or sulfuric acid ester radical can also be used. Examples of anionic synthetic detergents which can provide the anion moiety of the skin conditioning agents herein include the following 1.Alkyl sulfates of the formula R240S03M wherein R24 is an alkyl straight or branched chain of from 8 to 24 carbon atoms and M is an alkali metal or ammonium ion. Specific examples are sodium dodecyl sulfate and potassium hexadecyl sulfate. 2. Alkyl sulfonates of the formula R24S03M wherein R24 and M are as defined in 1 above.

A specific example isEMI13.2 5. Alkyl benzene sulfonates of the formulaEMI13.3 wherein R24 and M are as defined in 1 above.Specific examples are dodecylbenzene sodium sulfonate and tridecylbenzene potassium 6. Acyl lactylates of the formulaEMI14.1 wherein R24 and M are as defined in 1 above, and z is usually a number of from 1 to 3. A specific example is sodium stearoyl 2 lactylate.Following is a listing of representative examples of skin conditioning agents of the present invention EMI14.2 EMI15.1 EMI16.1 Examples of preferred skin conditioning agents of the present invention are stearylammonium laurate stearylammonium stearate, distearyldimethylaininonium laurate, and distearyldimethylammonium stearate. Generally the ratio of soap to conditioning agent in the compositions herein will be from about 1 1 to about 100 1, preferably from about 3 1 to about 20 1. OPTIONAL COMPONENTS The soap compositions of the present invention will normally contain water. When the compositions are in the form of a lotion or cream, the water content will be of the order of 50 to about 95 . When the compositions are formulated into toilet bars, the water content will normally be of the order of 20 or less. Conventional antibacterial agents can be included in the present composition at levels of from about 0.5 to about 4 . Typical antibacterial agents which are suitable for use herein are 3,4 di and 3,4 ,5 tribromosalicylanilides 4,4 dichloro 3 trifluoromethyl cabanilide 3,4,4 trichlorocarbanilide and mixtures of these materials. Conventional nonionic emollients can be included as additional skin conditioning agents in compositions of the present invention at levels up to about 40 , preferably at levels of from about 1 to about 25 . Such materials include, for example, mineral oils, paraffin wax having a melting point of from about 1000F to about 1700F, fatty sorbitan esters see U.S Patent 3,98S,255, Seiden, issued October 26, 1976 incorporated herein by reference , lanolin and lanolin derivatives, esters such as isopropyl myristate and triglycerides such as coconut oil or hydrogenated tallow.These nonionic type skin conditioning agents appear to primarily contribute internal skin feel advantages to the compositions herein, whereas the aforedescribed protonated amine or quaternary salt conditioning agents appear to primarily contribute external skin feel advantages. Free fatty acid such as coconut oil fatty acid can be added to the compositions herein to improve the volume and quality creaminess of the lather produced by the compositions herein. Conventional perfumes, dyes and pigments can also be incorporated into compositions of the invention at levels up to about 58. Perfumes are preferably used at levels of from about 0.58 to 3 and dyes and pigments are preferably used at levels of from about 0.0018 to about 0.58. Synthetic detergents can also be present in compositions herein, Preferred types of synthetic detergents are of the anionic or nonionic type. Examples of anionic synthetic detergents are the salts of organic sulfuric reaction products described in 1 through 5 hereinbefore. Examples of nonionic synthetic detergents are ethoxylated fatty alcohols erg., the redaction product of one mole of coconut fatty alcohol with from about 3 to 30 moles of ethylene oxide, the reaction product of one mole of coconut fatty acid with from about 3 to 30 moles of ethylene oxide and fatty acid amides such as coconut fatty acid monoethanolamide and stearic acid diethanolamide. Although it may be desirable in some instances to incorprorate synthetic detergents into the compositions of the present invention, the compositions herein can be free of synthetic detergents. Synthetic detergents when present are normally employed at levels of from about 5 to about 400 by weight of the amount of soap in the compositions. Insoluble alkaline earth metal soaps such as calcium stearate and magnesium stearate can also be incorporated into compositions of the present invention at levels up to about 30 . These materials are particularly useful in toilet bars in which synthetic detergents are present in that they tend to reduce the relatively high solubility which such bars normally have. These alkaline earth metal soaps are not included within the term soap as otherwise used in this specification. The term soap as used herein refers to the alkali metal soaps. Lotions or creams can optionally contain thickeners or phase stabilizers such as carboxymethyl cellulose or xanthum gum. COMPOSITION PREPARATION The compositions of the present invention can be prepared in the form of toilet bars, or if desired, in the form of creams or lotions. The toilet bar is the most preferred form since this is the form of cleansing agent most commonly used to wash the skin. Preferably the toilet bars are made from a mixture of soaps derived from coconut oil and hydrogenated tallow, the ratio of coconut soap to tallow soap being from about 1 1 to about 1 4. The toilet soap compositions generally contain from about 5 to about 20 moisture. Toilet bars of the present invention can be prepared in the conventional manner. Moisture containing base soap can be admixed with the conditioning agent and other optional ingredients such as perfumes, dyes, etc., in an amalgamator, milled in the conventional manner under conventional conditions, and extruded into logs for cutting and stamping into toilet bars. Alternatively, the skin conditioning agent can be co melted with the base soap and then cooled to solidify the mixture before introduction into the amalgamator. In making lotions or creams, the conditioning agent is thoroughly mixed with an aqueous solution or dispersion of the soap. Toilet bars of the invention generally comprise from about 10 to about 90 preferably from 60 to 90 soap and from about 1 to about 25 preferably from about 5 to about 15 of the conditioning agents of the invention. Creams generally comprises from about 10 to about 45 soap and from about 0.5 to about 15 conditioning agent. Lotions generally comprises from about 3 to about 15 soap and from about .25 to about 5 conditioning agent.Creams generally contain from about 50 to about 75 water, and lotions about 75 to about 95 water. The compositions of the invention can be used to prepare articles for cleansing the skin. These articles can comprise an absorbent paper or woven or nonwoven cloth which is impregnated with a composition of the invention. For example, a nonwoven cloth can be impregnated with an aqueous solution of a toilet bar composition of the invention and then subjected to a drying process which drives off sufficient water to reduce the moisture content to about 20 or less of the composition thereby producing a cleansing article which is dry to the touch. Generally the amount of composition on the substrate should be sufficient to produce a composition s bstrate ratio of about 0.5 1 to 5 1. When it is used it is simply wetted with water and used in the usual manner of a wash cloth. COSOSITION USE The compositions of the present invention are used in the conventional manner of skin cleansing agents, i.e., they are applied to the skin and then the skin is rinsed with water. In the case of lotions and creams the composition can be topically applied as is to the skin.In the case of toilet bars, a solution or dispersion of the composition is formed prior to application by wetting the surface of the bar or rubbing the bar onto a wet washcloth.The wet bar or the wet washcloth which contains a portion of the composition is then rubbed against the skin. Accordingly, the present invention also includes a method for cleansing and conditioning of the skin, said method comprising the steps of Cl applying to the skin a composition of the invention and t2 rinsing the skin with water. The invention will be further illustrated by the following examples EXAMPLE I A toilet bar of the following composition was prepared Soap 50 50 Tallow Coconutl 54.9 Coconut Fatty Acid 4.5 Paraffin Wax M.P. 1330F 24.8 Stearylammonium Laurate 5.0 Perfume 1.0 NaCl 0.8 Moisture and Miscellaneous 9.0 inc.
