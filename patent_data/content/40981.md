## Abstract
A split angle end rod assembly 10 comprising an elongated rod 12 having a longitudinal axis and inte gral with an upper bearing housing 14 . A separate lower bearing housing 16 is included and bolts 18 secure the two bearing housings 14, 16 together to define a circular bearing pocket. The housings 14, 16 mate on a diameter which is disposed at an acute angle relative to the longitudinal axis of the rod 12 . A sleeve bearing 20 is disposed in the pocket and in cludes an inner bearing surface 28 surrounding a cylindrical journalled member 26 in close spaced rela tionship therewith. The bearing surface 28 has a first portion A extending circumferentially on a constant radius r and a second portion B extending throughout the remaining circumference but being disposed outside the constant radius r of the first portion A and joins the first portion A on the constant radius r thereof.
