# Nail coating formulation.

## Abstract
A nail coating formulation which upon drying forms a film which will adhere to keratin of the nail and has a moisture vapor transmission from about 0.1 to about 1.6 mg. cm.Â² hr., said formulation comprising an aqueous emulsion of a copolymer having a solids content of from about 30 to about 55 percent, the copolymer having a glass transition temperature within the range of about 10 C. to about 50 C. as determined by differential thermal analysis and being prepared by the aqueous emulsion polymerization of two or more of the following monomers, at least one of which is of formula I or formula II
