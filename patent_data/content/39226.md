# Resin composition comprising water soluble polyamide and vinyl alcohol based polymer.

## Abstract
A resin composition is described consisting essentially of from 0.5 to 100 parts by weight of a water soluble polyamide and from 0.5 to 100 parts by weight of a vinyl alcohol based polymer. The resin composition has excellent transparency and can be used, for example, to form light sensitive resin compositions and adhesives.
