# Position control apparatus.

## Abstract
An improved method and apparatus for servo control of the position of a read write head 18 with respect to a magne tic disk 10 is disclosed. The disk comprises permanenty re corded position data information 12 . Upon initiation of a head traverse or seek operation, a microprocessor is controlled to select predetermined portions of instruction sequences, all of which sequences are used in the event the seek is such that the head 18 reaches its maximum velocity. Otherwise, por tions of the accelerate and decelerate command sequences are chosen together with constant velocity commands as ne cessary to ensure that the head 18 is decelerated smoothly to a stop at the appropriate position.
