# Process for manufacturing magnetic recording media.

## Abstract
A manufacturing process of Co Ni magnetic recording media by sputtering Co Ni thin film layer on a substrate in Argon atmosphere including oxygen or air and heating the thin film to evaporate oxygen or air from the layer to prepare the magnetic recording media appropriate for high density longitudinal recording, wherein on sputtering the substrate is maintained at a temperature of room temperature to 300 C.
