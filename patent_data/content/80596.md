# Collet lock for a mold assembly.

## Abstract
A mechanism for locking two mold parts together included a cylindrical tie rod 28 securely mounted on one mold part 17 and having a circumferential groove 36 therein. A cylindrical collet sleeve 71 is rigidly mounted on the other mold part 16 and has a plurality of axially extending, circumferentially spaced, resiliently flexible arms 76 at one end. The free end of each arm 76 has an inwardly projecting locking member 77 thereon which the arm resiliently urges radially inwardly. When the mold parts 16, 17 are moved to a closed position, the tie rod 28 is received within the collet sleeve 71 and the locking members 77 become axially aligned with are urged into engagement with the tie rod groove 36 . An annular collar 72 encircling the tie rod 28 is then moved axially until its inner surface snugly engages the outer surface of the collet arms 76 , thereby preventing radially outward movement of the collet arms 76 . The movement of the collar 72 is effected by an annular, pneumatically actuated piston 86 which is disposed in an annular chamber which encircles the collet sleeve 71 and is operatively connected to the collar.
