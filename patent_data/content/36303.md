# Process for analyzing anions and process for treating radioactive liquid waste utilizing the same.

## Abstract
Process for analyzing anions by isolation of anions in a liquid by means of an ion exchanger and by complex forma tion with specific anions to be analyzed by addition of a com plexing agent such as polyhydric alcohol. Sensitivity is increased because the complexes of specific anions with the complexing agent selected has a high acid activity which can be precisely measured. The process is particularly applied to the analysis of borate in radioactive waste.
