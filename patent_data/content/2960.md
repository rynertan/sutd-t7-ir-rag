# Manufacture of zeolite A crystals of uniformly small particle size.

## Abstract
In the manufacture of zeolite A crystals, characterized by a size in the range of about 1 to about 10 µm micro meters or microns the crystal size is controlled to within the range of 1 µm by seeding a sodium aluminum silicate gel that is free of nucleating particles with a predetermined number of comminuted zeolite A crystals having a number average particle size less than about 0.5 µm.
