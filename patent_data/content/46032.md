# Method of numerical control.

## Abstract
A numerical control method, and a numerical control device for subjecting a workpiece to a predetermined machining operation on the basis of a machining program. When a specified signal is generated during a machining operation under the control of the machining program, a subprogram, to which the numerical control device responds to execute processing in accordance with the specified signal, is stored in memory beforehand. Machining in progress under the control of the machining program is interrupted temporarily by the generation of the specified signal. At the same time, the subprogram is read from memory and is utilized in the processing of predetermined process steps. Following such processing, machining under the control of the machining program is resumed from the point of interruption or from an earlier point.
