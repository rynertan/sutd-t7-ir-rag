# SUPPORT FOR BACKFLUSHABLE FILTER MEDIA

## Abstract
This invention comprehends a new and unique means for preventing the crowns of a backflushable filter element unit from splitting which has heretofore been caused by the cyclic action of the cleaning and backflushing. A layer of staple material is positioned adjacent the outer layer of filter media to prevent bellowing or ballooning. An additional staple layer may be positioned adjacent the inner layer of filtered media to provide additional support. With both staple layers in position on both sides of the filter media, the media is firmly captured and the crowns will not split.
