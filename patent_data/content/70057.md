## Description
AGGLOMERATED PEAT PARTICLES AND A METHOD FOR THEIRPRODUCTION The present invention relates to granulated peat and to a method for making it. In our British Patent Specifications Nos. 1048254, 1070641 and 1357001 we have proposed methods for granulating peat particles in which the particles are tumbled in the presence of water and fertilizer salts. We have now found that peat particles can be granulated by tumbling in the presence of calcium and or magnesium salts which are deposited, e.g. precipitated, in situ. This is surprising, since our earlier specifications require that the fertilizer salts used be water soluble or be supplied as an aqueous solution. This is in contrast to the present invention where the salts which are precipitated or formed in situ have a water solubility of less than ig per 100ml of water at 200C. The formation of the salts in situ has a beneficial cementing effect on the agglo nerates of peat particles and can lead to less attrition of the agglomerates during subsequent handling A further advantage is that the insoluble salts may be free of fertilizer properties and that the agglomerated peat particles can, therefore, be used as an inert carrier. Alternatively, fertilizer salts may be present in lower concentrations e.g. 2 w w than was previously possible. For convenience the term precipitated will be used herein to denote in general the deposition of a solid phase upon a substrate and can be caused by the interaction of two materials to form a less soluble product which is deposited and or the removal of water from a solution of material to cause deposition of material from the solution. Furthermore, the precipitation and or growth of crystals of the solid precipitated can occur or continue after the tumbling of the peat particles has occurred. Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for agglomerating peat particles which comprises agitating the particles in the presence of water and calcium and or magnesium salts which are caused to precipitate in situ as a calcium and or magnesium salt having a water solubility of less than lg per 100ml of water at 200C. Preferably the solubility is less than 0.4g per 100ml of water at 200C. The invention also provides an agglomeration of peatparticles containing as binder for the particles a calcium and or magnesium salt having a solubility of less than lg per 100ml of water at 200C. The invention can be applied to a wide range of forms of peat, both sedge and sphagnum, but is of special use for sedge peat. It is also of particular use with the fine sphagnum peat particles described in our BritishPatent Specification No. 1357001. The sphagnum peat particles can be prepared for present use by any suitable method, e.g. milling or grinding and preferably substantially 100 of the sphagnum peat particles before agglomeration have a particle size less than lmm. We prefer that the peat particles used as the starting material in the process of the invention have a moisture content of from 100 to 250 by weight, based on the dry weight of the peat solids.If however the peat has been dried, e.g. for transport and or storage, or if desired, free water, notably as the solvent phase for a salt component as described below, can be fed to the tumbling peat particles. Also the peat can be subjected to pre treatment, e.g. ammoniation or treatment with an acid, before it is agglomerated. Agglomeration to produce granules is achieved by agitating the peat particles in the presence of water and a calcium and or magnesium salt which is caused to precipitate in situ during or after the agitation. The calcium and or magnesium salts can be used in the form of suspensions or slurries of solid particles of the salt in water, as when a suspension of calcium sulphate is fed to a tumbling bed of peat particles. Suitable low solubility calcium or magnesium salts for present use include the sulphates, phosphates, carbonates, hydroxides and silicates. However, it may be necessary to use large amounts of water to dissolve adequate amounts of the low solubility salts to achieve a binding effect and this may impose unacceptable loads on the granule drying equipment.We have found that this problem can be overcome by forming the low solubility salts by the interaction of other salts to form a precipitate of the desired salt, e.g. as when calcium chloride and sodium sulphate react to form a precipitate n situ. Suitable soluble materials which react to form the low solubility salts in situ include the chlorides, nitrates, and the dihydrogen phosphate salts of calcium and or magnesium and the hydroxides, carbonates, sulphates, phosphates and or silicates of sodium, potassium and or ammonia or free mineral acids e.g. sulphuric or phosphoric acid. The materials which are to react to form the precipitates in situ are conveniently provided as solutions or suspensions in water.However, if desired the materials may be used in solid form, e.g. as powders the moisture in the peat and or a separate feed of free water supplying the necessary water to dissolve the materials in situ. In some cases the reaction between materials may take some time to go to completion, as when monocalcium phosphate, e.g. in the form of superphosphate, is reacted with calcium carbonate or ammonium sulphate to form the less soluble dicalcium phosphate or calcium sulphate respectively. Thus, precipitation of the less soluble calcium salt may occur not only during the agitation of the peat particles, but also at later stages in the process, e.g. during the drying of the granulated particles and may be assisted by the increase in temperature during the drying process. The calcium and or magnesium salts are preferably used in such amounts as to provide a total of from 1 to 25 parts, and more preferably from 15 to 20 parts, by weight of precipitated salt expressed as CaO or MgO, per part by weight of dry peat solids. The agitation of the peat particles to form agglomerates can be carried out in any suitable apparatus, e.g. in a rotating drum or pan granulator, or in a rotating inclined tubular granulator. Water and the necessary materials can be premixed with the feed of peat particles or can be fed, e.g. by means of sprayers, dribble bars or sparge pipes, to the tumbling bed of particles. If desired other ingredients, e.g. fertilizer salts, diluents e.g. sand or vermiculite , pH adjusters e.g. chalk or dolomite limestone , pesticides, fungicides, herbicides or pigments can also be included in the mixture formed in the granulation process. Agitation of the peat particles is conveniently carried out at from ambient to 800C, e.g. 15 to 500C, and for such time as is.required to form granules in the size range 0.5 to 5.0mm. The agitation can be carried out as a continuous process or in batches. The agglomerated peat particles are desirably subjected to accelerated drying, e.g. in a forced air draught, in a hot air oven or on a moving perforated belt, to reduce the moisture content to below 60 based on the weight of dry peat solids, e.g. 5 to 20 . Preferably, drying is carried out at less than 1200C, e.g. at 50 to 800C. Where agglomeration is carried out in dn elongated tubular granulator, hot air can be blown through the tube countercurrent to the flow of particles to cause drying of the agglomerates as they are being formed. The peat agglomerates of the invention find widespread use where a particulate inert carrier is required. Thus the agglomerates can be treated with a biocide, e.g. a pesticide or fungicide, after agglomeration, e.g. by the spraying of the biocide onto the surface of the agglomerates or by the solid particles of biocide being attached to the surface of the agglomerates with a suitable adhesive e.g. methyl cellulose, or can have such a biocide incorporated therein during manufacture. The following examples are given to illustrate, but in no way limit, the present invention.Example 1 Sedge peat 40 parts dry weight was mixed with triple super phosphate 20 parts , hydrated calcium hydroxide 20 parts and calcium carbonate 20 parts .The mixture was agitated in a dough mixer and 0.75 kg of water was added over a period of 2 minutes. Agitation was continued for a further 3 minutes. After agitation the mixture was allowed to stand for 10 minutes before being dried at a temperature of 80 0C for a period of 90 minutes to reduce the water content to below 5 weight weight. Particles in the size range 1 to 4 mm were removed by sieving. Example 2 Sphagnum peat 25 parts dry weight was mixed with triple super phosphate 40 parts , magnesium sulphate hepta hydrate 20 parts and calcium carbonate 15 parts . The mixture was agitated in a dough mixer and 1.2 kg of water was added over a period of 3 minutes.Agitation was continued for a further 3 minutes. After agitation the mixture was allowed to stand for 10 minutes before being dried at a temperature of 800C for a period of 90 minutes to reduce the water content to below 5 weight weight. Particles in the size range 1 to 4 mm were removed by sieving.
