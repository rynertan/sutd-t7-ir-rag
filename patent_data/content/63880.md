# Poly esteramide derived from 6 hydroxy 2 naphthoic acid.

## Abstract
A melt processable poly ester amide which is ca pable of forming an anisotropic melt phase is provided. The poly ester amide of the present invention consists essentially of the recurring units a 6 oxy 2 naphthoyl moiety, b aromatic moiety capable of forming an amide linkage in the polymer and, optionally, c other aromatic moiety derived from aromatic hydroxyacid, in the proportions indicated. The aromatic moiety capable of forming an amide linkage in the polymer is an amino derivative or a substituted amino derivative of an aro matic carboxylic acid. Preferably, the aromatic moiety capable of forming an amide linkage is derived from p aminobenzoic acid. The resulting poly ester amide ex hibits a melting temperature below 400 C., preferably below 350 C. The poly ester amide of the present in vention is preferably formed by a melt polymerisation technique.
