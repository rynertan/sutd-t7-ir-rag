# Polyolefins having addition polymer adherent thereto, their preparation and articles comprising them.

## Abstract
Untreated polyolefins, particularly polypropylene, have adherent thereto vinyl addition polymer of monomer comprising at least 5 by weight of one or more of the following primary monomers a at least one monomer having the formula The adherent polymer may be used alone or in admixture with other polymer and may serve as a coating, tiecoat, adhesive or binder. Polyolefins bearing the adherent polymer may be in the form of nonwoven fabrics, laminates or flocked fabrics.
