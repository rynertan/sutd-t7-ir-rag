# Disconnect and overload bypass arrangement for a portable tool.

## Abstract
A circuit is directed to a disconnect and overload bypass 16 arrangemant for a hand held portable tool equipped with an electric motor 3 supplied from a source 13 of electrical energy and a manually operable on off switch 14 for switch ing the tool on and off. The arrangement includes a self reclosing disconnect switch 15 operatively connected to the motor 3 to temporarily disconnect the same from the energy source 13 in response to an overload condition and, circuit control means for supplying energy to the motor 3 at a reduced level when the disconnect switch 15 is open whereby the motor 3 will continue to operate at reduced torgue pending self reclosure of the disconnect switch 15 and thereby provide the operator of the tool with an audible and visual indication that the motor has not been deactivated by manually actuating the on off switch 14 .
