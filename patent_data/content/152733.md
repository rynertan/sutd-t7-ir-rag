# Optical scanner having multiple, simultaneous scan lines with different focal lengths.

## Abstract
An optical scanner uses frequency modulation and detec tion techniques to produce and utilize multiple, simultaneous scan patterns in which corresponding scan lines have different focal lenghts. Two or more solid state lasers 10, 12 are modu lated at unique frequencies. The frequency modulated output beams pass through different combinations of focusing 18, 24 lenses and are deflected by a single beam deflecting ap paratus 20, 22 . Light reflected from any scanned object is de tected 28 . The resulting multi frequency signal is applied to a plurality of bandpass filters 30 to separate the returned signal into a plurality of separately decodable signals for further pro cessing 32, 34, 36 .
