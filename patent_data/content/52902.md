# Method and device for character segmentation.

## Abstract
Each character is converted into a pattern of image elements. The image elements form columns and rows. The grey values of the image elements are summed per column and the summed column values are put in relation with a fixed number of columns per character 1 . After the outermost character position on a line has been found 2 , a first segmenting process is carried out on the basis of a first probable distance between characters 3 . After the segment ing process has been carried out for several different character distances S‚ÇÅ S
