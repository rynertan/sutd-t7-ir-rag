# Ignition distributor cap.

## Abstract
A method of securing terminals 16 to a distributor cap 10 and the cap formed thereby. A moulded thermoplastics distributor cap 10 is provided which has bores 86,88 formed in towers 14 of the cap 10 . Die cast zinc terminals 16 having ribs 38 42 and recesses 50 54 therebetween are partially inserted into the bores 86,88 of the cap 10 . With the terminals 16 partially inserted into the cap 10 they are engaged by an electrically heated head member 100 which causes the terminals 16 and cap material to heat up. When the cap material is heated to a flowable state, the terminals 16 are pushed into the cap 10 and cap material is moved into the recesses 50 54 to anchor the terminals 16 in the cap 10 . The terminals 16 are provided with vent slots 46 .
