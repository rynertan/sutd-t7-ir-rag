# Hermetic terminal assembly.

## Abstract
An hermetic terminal assembly wherein a radially extending flange 21 on a current conducting pin 17 that extends through a hole 11 defined by a cover member 3 adapted to be secured to an opening in a motor housing is surrounded by an electrically insulating sleeve 23 with the inner axial extremity of the sleeve 23 extending at an axial location relative the pin 17 substantially beyond the inner face of the radially extending flange 21 to provide an extended tortuous path between the flange 21 on the pin 17 and the cover member 3 , the pin 17 having a reduced neck portion 36 on the inner end thereof adjacent the inner face of the flange 21 to provide a fuse like area.
