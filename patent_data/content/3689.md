# Dry release transfer and method of producing such a transfer.

## Abstract
A dry release transfer is disclosed in which a releasable layer 9 is adhered to a carrier sheet 1 and a stress resisting transferable design layer 3, 4 is printed on the releasable layer. The releasable layer 2 is normally prestressed in the region 5 , of transferable layer so that when an external force is applied to the carrier sheet, e.g. by rubbing with a stylus, this force is transmitted to the releasable layer 2 . Since the releasable layer cannot yield to the applied force by stretching, because it is held by the stress resisting layer, the adhesive bond between the releasable layer and the carrier sheet 1 is weakened or is ruptured or partial or complete cohesive failure occurs within the releasable layer, thereby facilitating transfer of the design layer. A method of producing such transfers is also disclosed.
