# Fail safe system for automotive engine control system for fail safe operation as crank angle sensor fails operation thereof and fail safe method therefor, and detection of fault in crank angle sensor.

## Abstract
A fail safe system for an engine control system is ca pable of performing a fail safe operation when a crank angle sensor fails. When the crank angle sensor malfunctions, at least one of a crank reference signal and a crank position signal will be absent. The fail safe system prevents the engine from stalling even when one of the crank reference signal and the crank position signal is absent. The fail safe operation will be carried out when the absence of the crank reference signal and or the crank position signal is de tected. In the fail safe operation, a fail safe signal is produced for controlling engine operation as a replacement for an engine control signal from the engine control system under normal conditions. The signal value of the fail safe signal may be variable in accordance with an engine operat ing condition derived from an engine control parameter other than the crank angle sensor signals.
