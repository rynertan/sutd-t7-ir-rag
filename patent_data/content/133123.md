## Description
TElE OF THE INENTION IMMUNOGENS OF PAPILLOMA VIRUSES. 1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a process for the production of proteins related to viral capsid proteins of papillomavirus PV , and to processes and compositions for making and using novel DNA sequences, plasmids and microorganisms to produce viral capsid proteins. The present invention utilizes recombinant DNA techniques to insert a DNA sequence coding for a capsid protein of bovine papillomavirus BPV , or a portion thereof, into a DNA vector, such dS viral DNA, plasmid DNA or bacteriophage DNA, such that the vector is capable of replicating and directing expression of the BPV DNA in a bacterial host or other single cell system. The resulting recombinant DNA molecule is used to transform host cells and thereby enables production of BPV related proteins, or portions thereof, by the host cells. The proteins so produced are isolated, purified and modified for use as immunogens in vaccines which protect against infection by papillomavirus. 2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 2.1. RECOMBINANT DNA TECHNOLOGY AND GENE EXPRESSION Recombinant DNA technology involves insertion of specific DNA sequences into a DNA vehicle vector to form a recombinant DNA molecule which is capable of replication in a host cell. Generally, the inserted DNA sequence is foreign to the recipient DNA vehicle, i.e., the insertedDNA sequence and the DNA vector are derived from organisms which do not exchange genetic information in nature, or the inserted DNA sequence may be wholly or partially synthetically made. In recent years several general methods have been developed which enable construction of recombinant DNA molecules. For example, U.S. Pat. No.4,237,224 to Cohen and Boyer describes production of such recombinant plasmids using restriction enzymes and methods known as ligation. These recombinant plasmids are then introduced and replicated in unicellular organisms by means of transformation. Because of the general applicability of the techniques described therein, U.S.Pat. No. 4,237,224 is hereby incorporated by reference into the present specification. Another method for introducing recombinant DNA molecules into unicellular organisms is described byCollins and Hohn in U.S. Pat. No. 4,304,863 which is also incorporated herein by reference. This method utilizes a packaging transduction system with bacteriophage vectors cosmids . Regardless of the method used for construction, the recombinant DNA molecule must be compatible with the host cell, i.e., capable of autonomous replication in the host cell. The recombinant DNA molecule should also have a marker function which allows the selection of host cells so transformed by the recombinant DNA molecule. In addition, if all of the proper replication, transcription and translation signals are correctly arranged on the DNA molecule, the foreign gene will be properly expressed in the transformed cells and their progeny. As is characteristic of all viruses which infect eucaryotic cells, papillomavirus requires a eucaryotic host cell system in which to replicate its genome, express its viral genes and generate its progeny. The signals and control elements for DNA replication, gene expression and virus assembly in eucaryotes differ from those of procaryotes. This ii of critical importance when attempts are made to express in procaryotic host cells a gene which is naturally expressed only in eucaryotic cells. These different genetic signals and processing events control many levels of gene expression for instance, DNA transcription and messenger RNA translation. Transcription of DNA is dependent upon the presence of a promoter which is a DNA sequence that directs the binding of RNA polymerase and thereby promotes transcription. The DNA sequences of eucaryotic promoters differ from those of procaryotic promoters. Furthermore, ecaryotic promoters and accompanying genetic signals may not be recognized in or may not function in a procaryotic system. Similarly, translation of messenger RNA mRNA in procaryotes depends upon the presence of the proper procaryotic signals which differ from those of eucaryotes. Efficient translation of mRNA in procaryotes requires a ribosome binding site called the Shine Dalgarno SD sequence on the mRNA. This sequence is a short nucleotide sequence of mRNA that is located before the start codon AUG which encodes the amino terminal methionine of the protein. The SD sequences are complementary to the 3 end of the 16S rRNA ribosomalRNA and probably promote binding of mRNA to ribosomes by duplexing with the rRNA to allow correct positioning of the ribosome. For a review on maximizing gene expression, see Roberts and Lauer, 1979, Methods in Enzymology 68 473. In addition to these different control elements, many eucaryotic genes contain intervening sequences introns which are not present in the mature mRNA or the corresponding double stranded complementary DNA cDNA coding for the gene. During mRNA processing in eucaryotes, these introns are spliced out of the mRNA prior to translation for reviews see Crick, 1979, Science 204 264i Sharp, 1971, Cell 23 643 . Expression of eucaryotic genes cloned in procaryotic hosts requires that the coding sequence of the gene of interest be available in a form uninterrupted by intervening sequences. Therefore, when eucaryotic genetic sequences which contain intervening sequences are to be cloned in a procaryotic host, isolation of mRNA as the source of the genetic information offers an advantage over the isolation of the relevant DNA sequence. Accordingly, the isolated mRNA is transcribed into single stranded complementary DNA cDNA copies which are then enzymatically processed into double stranded DNA molecules which can be inserted into cloning vectors. Such recombinant DNA techniques have been recently used for cloning cDNA copies of RNA viral genomes such as poliovirus vesicular stomatitis virus and influenza. These techniques also have application in the development of antiviral vaccines Heiland and Getning, 1981, Nature London 292 851 . Many other factors complicate the expression of eucaryotic genes in procaryotes even after the proper signals are inserted and appropriately positioned. A clear understanding of. the nature of these factors and the mechanisms by which they operate is presently lacking.However, one such factor is the presence of an active proteolytic system in E. coli and other bacteria. This protein degrading system appears to selectively destroy ZabnormalW or foreign proteins such as eucaryotic proteins. A tremendous utility, therefore, would be afforded by the development of a means to protect eucaryotic proteins expressed in bacteria from proteolytic degradation. One strategy is to construct hybrid genes in which the eucaryotic sequence is ligated in phase i.e., in the correct reading frame with a procaryotic gene resulting in a fusion protein product a protein that is a hybrid of procaryotic and foreign or eucaryotic amino acid sequences . Construction of hybrid genes was the approach used in the molecular cloning of genes encoding a number of eucaryotic proteins, such as somatostatin Itakura et al., 1977, Science 198 1056 , rat pre proinsulin Villa Komaroff et al., 1978, Proc. Natal. Acad. Sci.,U.S.A. 75 3727 , growth hormone Seeburg et al., Nature 276 795 , and ovalbumin like protein Mercereau Puijalon et al., 1978, Nature 275 505 . Additionally, procaryotic promoters have been ligated to such fusion gene sequences in the case of ovalbumin Fraser et al., 1978, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U.S.A. 75 5936 and B globin Guarente et al., 1980, Cell 20 543 . The Guarente et al. system involves inserting the lac promoter, including the SD sequence, at varying distances in front of the ATG of the fusion gene. Although the molecular cloning and expression of several eucaryotic genes has been accomplished, this has not heretofore been done for any of the papillomavirus genes encoding capsid proteins. Nor is the state of the art such that expression of foreign or eucaryotic genes in procaryotic host cells may be routinely performed. 2.2. VACCINES There are four basic approaches for the control and therapy of viral infections 1 vaccines that elicit an active immune response 2 chemotherapeutic agents that inhibit viral replication 3 agents that induce the synthesis of interferon and 4 administration of antibodies for passive immunity. All four can be used to prevent infection, but are more effective when applied early in infection. Vaccination, or active immunization is usually ineffective after infection has begun. Viruses are small and relatively simple in structure. Viruses contain a central core of nucleic acid either DNA or RNA surrounded by a protein coat called a caps id. In many viruses, the capsid is surrounded by a loose membranous envelope which is similar to a cellular membrane in composition. Nonenveloped viruses are referred to as naked capsids. The nucleic acid core of viruses contains, through a complex coding scheme, the information needed for infecting cells of host tissues, replicating the virus genome and producing the protein components of the virion particle. When an animal is infected by a virus, it reacts to the capsid or envelope protein as a foreign protein.The host may develop immunity, which is manifested by the formation of antibodies and lymphocytes which are capable of recognizing the viral proteins. This may result in inactivation of the virus and lysis of infected cells.Thus, conventional vaccines providing active immunity are prepared by producing large amounts of virus in cell tissue culture or in laboratory animals and then rendering the virus harmless without destroying its immunological properties. Traditionally this is accomplished either by inactivating the infectivity of the virus i.e., wkillingN the virus, usually by treatment with various chemical agents such as formaldehyde for use in inactivated vaccines, or by selecting an avirulent or attenuated modified virus for use in live vaccines attenuated vaccines . Attenuation is obtained by rdaptiny the virus to unusual conditions e.g., to different animal hosts and cell cultures and by frequent passages of large viral inocula to select mutants which have lost virulence.A few vaccines still used in veterinary practice consist of fully virulent infectious virus injected in a site where virus multiplication is of little consequence. Attenuated virus used in live vaccines are generally excellent immunogens because the attenuate virus multiplies in the host thus eliciting long lasting immunity. Attenuated virus vaccines induce humoral antibodies directed against both virion and nonvirion proteins. However, a number of problems are encountered with the use of live vaccines, such as insufficient attenuation of the virus, genetic instability of the virus, contamination by adventitious viruses in cell cultures used to grow the vaccine virus, and, finally, the vaccine may be unstable e.g., heat labile . While the use of inactivated vaccines employing killed or inactivated virus that does not multiply avoids the difficulties encountered with the use of live vaccines, killed viruses do not multiply in the immunizea animal and usually produce antibodies directed against only virion structural components. There are two major difficulties with inactivated vaccines. Firstly, it is frequently not possible to inactivate all the virus particles. Secondly, there is the difficulty of producing enough virus to provide the necessary quantity of the relevant antigen.Other difficulties encountered with the use of inactivated vaccines are that the immunity achieved is brief and often requires additional immunizations, tne antigenic sites may be altered by the inactivating chemical treatment, and thus be less immunogenic or may induce antibodies that are less effective at neutralizing viral infections, and that these vaccines do not induce satisfactory levels of secretory antibody. Subunit vaccines contain only the necessary and relevant immunogenic material, such as the capsid proteins of nonenveloped icosahedral viruses or the peplomers glycoprotein spikes of enveloped viruses. Subunit vaccines can be made by isolating the relevant subunit from highly purified viral fractions, or by synthesizing the relevant polypeptide. A major advantage of subunit vaccines is the exclusion of genetic material of viral origin and of toxic, contaminating or otherwise undesirable substances of the host or donor. However, at present, production of subunit vaccines using these methods is too expensive for widespread commercial veterinary use. Recombinant DNA technology has much to offer in the production of subunit vaccines the molecular cloning and host cell expression of viral genes which encode the relevant immunogenic portions of the virus or its proteins can produce sufficient quantities of the relevant polypeptide for use as an immunogen in a subunit vaccine. Vaccines are often administered in conjunction with various adjuvants. The adjuvants aid in attaining a more durable and higher level of immunity using smaller amounts of antigen in fewer doses than if the immunogen were administered alone. The mechanism of adjuvant action is complex and not completely understood. However, it may involve the stimulation of phagocytosis and other activities of the reticuloendothelial system as well as a delayed release and degradation of the antigen.Examples of adjuvants include Freund s adjuvant complete or incomplete , Adjuvant 65 containing peanut oil, mannide monooleate and aluminum monostearate , the pluronic polyolL 121 and mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide, aluminum phosphate, or alum. Freund s adjuvant is no longer used in vaccine formulations for humans or for food animals because it contains nonmetabolizable mineral oil and is a potential carcinogen however, the mineral gels are widely used in commercial veterinary vaccines. 2.3. PAPILLOMAVIRUSES Virus particles belonging to the PaPilloma genus of the family Papovaviridae have been isolated from lesions of man, cattle, rabbit, horse, dog, sheep, elk, deer, mouse and chaffinch. In addition, uncharacterized virus has been detected in papillomatous lesions of coyote, goat, opossum and pig. Papillomavirus is contagious in the animals in which it naturally occurs and natural infections are generally limited to the skin or mucous membranes. The lesions produced are either hyperplastic or benignly neoplastic. Although originally benign, some lesions may become malignant as in the cases of epidermodysplasia verruciformis in humans, papillomas of the upper alimentary tract in cattle and papillomas of the cottontail rabbit. Papillomaviruses cannot be grown in cell tissue culture nor have they been successfully produced in laboratory animals. Therefore, conventional methods of vaccine production as discussed in Section 2.2 cannot be used. In one case bovine papillomavirus a vaccine is manufactured from fresh wart tissue however, its efficacy is questionable. All papillomaviruses show a marked similarity in physical chemical properties. All have naked, icosahedral capsids ranging from 50 to 55 nm in diameter and a double stranded, covalently closed circular DNA molecule from 4.5 x 106 to 5.5 x 106 daltons in molecular weight. Immunological cross reactivity has been demonstrated between human papillomavirus type 1 SPV 1 and cottontail rabbit papillomavirus CRPV , bovine papillomavirus types 1 and 2 BPV 1 and 2 , canine oral papillomavirus as well as human papillomavirus type 2 HPV 2 Jensen et al., 1980, J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 64 495 500 Orth et al., 1978, Virology 91 243 255 .DNA DNA hybridization studies have detected regions of significant sequence homology between the genomes of BPV 1 and 2, HPV l, and CRPV Law et al., 1979, J. Virol. 32. 199 207 . Recently, the complete genomes of BPV 1 and HPV l have been sequenced Chen et al., 1982, Nature 299 529 534 Danos et al., 1982, EMBOJ 1 231 236 . Analyses of these sequences have shown the great similarity in structure between these two viruses and have allowed construction of a common papillomavirus genome map seeFIG. 1 . 2.3.1. BOVINE PAPILLOMAVIRUS Bovine papillomavirus BPV produces cutaneous fibropapillomas warts on cattle, its natural host. The warts occur either over the head nci neck or on the udder and teats. The disease is highly contagious, so, when a herd becomes infected, subsequent generations of cattle are usually involved. The teat warts present problems when using automatic milking machines. Warts in cattle also prevent the animals from being shown, which is a serious problem considering that over 500,000 cattle are raised for show each year. Warts may sometimes become large and invade the animals throat necessitating slaughter. BPV has also been shown to produce tumors in horses and hamsters Lancaster et al., 1977, Proc. atl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 74 524 528 Lancaster et al., 1979, Inter virology li 227 233 Olson and Cook, 1951, Proc.Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 77 281 284 . In addition BPV as well as BPV DNA can transform a number of cell types in culture black, 1963, Nature 199 1016 1018 Boiron et al., 1965, Virology 52 150 153t Thomas et al., 1964, Nature 202 709 710 . However, complete BPV particles have only been found in wart tissue from the natural host, cattle. Many attempts have been made to produce SPV particles in cell tissue culture and laboratory animals without success thus, current BPV vaccines are manufactured from fresh wart tissues obtained from slaughterhouses. The tissue is minced and ground, and the wart material containing proteins and virus particles, is sterilized, diluted to a standard concentration ana marketed. The quantity of virus in the vaccine is not determined nor is it a consideration in manufacture. Tne final product requires 10 50 mll of product per immunizing dose and all manufacturers suggest two doses be given to establish immunity. BPV particles contain only DNA and protein. As in all papillomaviruses this DNA is a double stranded, covalently closed and supercoiled circular nolecule it is surrounded by protein, forming a capsid with icosohedral symmetry. The capsid is composed of a single protein subunit with molecular weight of 53,500 daltons. This major capsid protein, designated VPI, constitutes about 759 of the total virus protein. Four host derived proteins of 15,000, 14,000, 13,000 and 11,280 daltons in molecular weight, along with four minor protein components of 74,000, 70,500, 48,000 and 46,000 daltons in molecular weight are also part of the BPV particle Meinke andMeinke, 1981, J. Gen. Virol. 52s 15 24 . At least five distinct types of BPV have been described which may differ in one or more of the following criteria DNA size, DNA sequence, and sites and types of abnormal tissue growths produced Campo, et al., 1980,Nature 286 180 182 Lancaster, 1979, J. Virol., 3d, 684 687t Lancaster and Olson, 1978, Virol. 89 372 379 Pfister et al., 1979, Virology 96 1 8 . Bovine papillomavirus type 1 and type 2 BPV 1 and BPV 2 are by far the predominant types found in warts on dairy and beef cattle within the United States, and both types are founo with about equal frequency. BPV 1 and BPV 2 differ in DNA sequence but these viruses demonstrate immunological cross reactivity Lancaster et al., 1979, J. Virol. 32 684 687 Lancaster and Olson, 1978, 89 372 379 . 3. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Methods and compositions are provided for the cloning and expression of papillomavirus PV capsid protein genes or portions thereof in microorganisms. Also described are methods for culturing these novel microorganisms to produce PV capsid protein or portions thereof. In bne embodiment of the present invention, theBPV 1 capsid genes were identified in the BPV 1 genome using nucleotide sequence data and restriction maps.Utilizing this information, the BPV 1 caps is protein genes, or portions thereof, were selectively isolated fromDNA carrying the entire BPV genome. Restriction endonuclease cleavage was performed at specific sites within the BPV 1 genome so as to isolate the desired fragment containing part or all of the BPV capsid protein genes. The isolated BPV capsid protein gene or gene fragment was subsequently inserted into a plasmid vector which served as a biologically functional replicon. This plasmid, containing the BPV capsid protein gene, was constructed so as to facilitate both the replication and expression of the BPV capsid protein gene upon transformation of compatible host cells. Additionally, the plasmid provided for a one step identification of transformed microorganisms actively expressing the BPV capsid protein. The proteins thus produced may be used in vaccine formulations. Vaccines produced by recombinant DNA technology can address many of the problems involved in the production of conventional vaccines. First, very little virus is needed in order to isolate the relevant genetic sequences which are used in the construction of recombinant DNA molecules. The use of such recombinant molecules to transform appropriate host cells allows for the production of effective vaccines against viruses that cannot be grown in cell tissue culture or in laboratory animals. Second, recombinant DNA vaccines are a type of subunit vaccine, they contain no viral genetic material or toxic, contaminating host substances. Third, since large scale bacterial fermentation can be used, the vaccines can be produced economically in large quantities. The present invention may be more fully understood by reference to the following detailed description of the invention, examples of specific embodiments of the invention, and the appended figures. 4.

ISOLATION AND CLONING OF THE PAPILLOMAVIRUS GENOME Papillomavirus particles can be purifiea from wart tissue using standard isolation techniques, e.g.,Meinke and Meinke, 1981, J. Virol. 52 15 24. The virus genomic DNA can be then purified from the viral proteins by standard DNA purification techniques. In order to provide a continuous supply of large amounts of papillomavirus genomic length DNA, the purified viral DNA can be inserted into a bacterial plasmid which can then be used to transform host cells in order to generate multiple copies. This can be accomplished by cleaving the circular DNA genome at a convenient, unique restriction endonuclease site as determined by restriction endonuclease mapping. This linear DNA molecule can then be inserted into an appropriate cloning vector.Any appropriate cloning vector containing a marker function may be used, for example such vectors include but are not limited to, SV40 DNA, bacteriophage vectors such as lambda gt WES lambda B, lambda Charon 28, lambda Charon 4A, lambda gt lambda BC, lambda GTl lambda B, or M13mp7, M13mp8, M13mp9 or other plasmid DNA vectors, such as pBR322, pAClOS, pVH5l, pACYC177, pKH47, pACYCl84, pUB110, pM39, pBR325, ColEl, pSC101, pBR313, pML21, RSF2124, pCRl, or RP4. If the cloning vector does not have restriction sites complementary to the ends of the gene fragment, then the ends of the gene fragment or the vector may be modified. Once ligated, the recombinant plasmid is used to transform the appropriate host cells. The host cell types used for transformation depend on the cloning vector, that is, the vector must be capable of replication in the host cell and must be otherwise compatible with the host cell.For the purposes of the examples contained herein, . coli was chosen as the host. Transformants are selected based upon the expression of appropriate gene markers normally present in the vector, such as ampicillin resistance or tetracycline resistance in pBR322. Expression of such marker proteins indicates that the plasmid is intact and is replicating. In the present examples, these recombinant plasmids contain the ampicillin or tetracycline resistance genes, so only clones that grow in the presence of either ampicillin or tetracycline are selected. 5.2. IDENTIFICATION OF THE CAPSID PROTEIN GENES Identification of areas on the genome of a particular papillomavirus that are common to all papillomaviruses allows one to locate the regions on the genome where the capsid proteins are encoded. The generalized papillomavirus genome map FIG. 1A shows areas of 1open reading frame1 labeled El, E2, L1 and L2, all or parts of which may be papillomavirus genes that code for papillomavirus specific proteins, For bovine papillomavirus type 1 BPV 1 it had been found that within non natural hosts, where no viral particles are produced, only regions El and E2 appear to be processed, while within wart tissues, where many viral particles are produced, regions L1 and L2 are also processed Antwann and Sauer, 1982, J. Virol. 43t 59 60 .Therefore, it is believed that region L1 and or region L2, or portions thereof, code for the BPV 1 capsid proteins.The results of our experiments, which form the basis for the production of a bovine papillomavirus vaccine, are the first good evidence that regions L1 and L2 do, indeed, code for all, or part of, a BPV 1 capsid protein. The fusion proteins produced herein, which contain portions of regions L1 and L2, induce the production of antibody in experimental animals. The induced antibodies react specifically with, and neutralize the infectivity of wholeBPV 1. Therefore, the analogous L1 and or L2 regions on any papillomavirus should also code for the viral capsid protein. A number of techniques are available to determine where these common areas are located. Ultimately, the whole papillomavirus genome could be sequenced. The position and direction of all open reading frames, and thus L1 and L2, could then be determined by analysis of the sequence by computer. Alternatively, areas of significant DNA homology could be used to locate the complementary sequences within the genomes of another papillomavirus. These areas of significant DNA homology are generally located within the open reading frames e.g., L1, L2, El and B2 . Therefore, a fragment of DNA containing the L1 region from a well characterized papillomavirus e.g., BPV 1 could be used to probe for the L1 region of an uncharacterized papillomavirus genome. The other open reading frames could then be located by their relative positions basea upon the generalized papillomavirus genome map.5.3. ISOLATION OF THE PAPILLOMAVIRUS CAPSID PROTEIN GENES Once the L1 and L2 regions have been located, it is desirable to identify the exact positions of the beginning initiation codon and sche end termination codon of the open reading frames and to identify restriction endonuclease sites convenient to these positions to allow isolation of as much of the open reading frame sequence as possible this may be accomplished by DNA sequencing and by mapping the restriction endonuclease sites.If convenient sites are not located at a desired position, a large DNA fragment containing the open reading frame may be isolated and excess DNA can be removed using standard techniques, e.g.,BAL31 nuclease digestion or exonuclease III followed by S1 nuclease digestion. The DNA ends can be further modified by filling in with E. coli DNA polymerase I or T4 DNA polymerase, and linker ligation ligating poly dC dG or poly dA dT tails or specific restriction linkers onto DNA ends . Generally, the restriction enzymes used for gene isolation are selected with the gene location and cloning vector in mind. Once convenient restriction sites have been chosen, a large quantity microgram amounts of the fragment containing the L1 or L2 gene is isolated. This is accomplished by growing on a large scale, the bacteria containing the viral genome in recombinant plasmids. The plasmid DNA is then isolated and cleaved with the appropriate restriction endonucleases. The desired DNA fragments containing the Ll or L2 sequence. are separated according to size and purified by standard techniques including agarose and polyacrylamiae gel electrophoresis and column chromatograpny. Alternatives to isolating the L1 or L2 gene include but are not limited to chemically synthesizing the gene sqeuence itself provided the sequence is known or making cDNA to the mRNA which encodes the L1 or L2 gene.To accomplish this, mRNA specific for L1 or L2 is isolated from homogenized wart tissues. Then the isolated mRNA is converted to a cDNA copy made double stranded and inserted directly into a cloning vector see Maniatis et al., 1982,Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring HarborLaboratory, Ch. 6 and 7 . 5.4. INSERTION OF THE PAPILLOMAVIRUS CAPSID PROTEIN GENES INTO EXPRESSION VECTORS Once isolated, the papilloma gene or gene fragment e.9. r L1 or L2 or a portion thereof is inserted into an appropriate expression vector, i.e., a vector which contains the necessary elements for transcription and translation of the inserted gene. In order to obtain efficient expression of a foreign gene, an expression vector must have the specific initiation signals required for efficient gene transcription and translation in procaryotic cells. RNA polymerase normally binds to the promoter and initiates transcription of a group of linked genes and regulatory elements, called an operon. Promoters vary in their trength , i.e., their ability to promote transcription.For the purpose of molecular cloning it is desirable to insert strong promoters in order to obtain a high level of transcription and, hence, expression of the gene. In the present invention, the lac promoter or a hybrid trp lacuv5 tac promoter was used. However, depending upon the host cell system utilized, any one of a number of other suitable promoters may be inserted. For instance, when cloning in an E. coli host cell system, any of the promoters isolated from E. coli, its bacteriophages or plasmids may be used. Additionally, E. coli promoters produced by recombinant DNA or other syntnetic DNA techniques may be inserted to provide for transcription of the inserted gene. More specifically, the Pg and PL promoters of bacteriophage lambda direct increasingly higher levels of transcription of adjacent DNA fragments.In addition, the recA promoters from E. coli provide high levels of gene transcription of adjacent fragments. Protein translation is initiated as the result of interaction between two mRNA sites the ribosome binding site Shine Dalgarno SD sequence on the DNA complement and the initiation codon AUG ATG, on DNa . In the specific examples of the invention the translation initiation signal, specifically the SD ATG combination, is derived from the E. coli lac gene or bacteriophage lambda. Other suitable SD ATG combinations that can be uitilized by E. coli ribosomes may be employed, such as the SD ATG combinations associated with tne cro or N genes of bacteriophage lambda, or from the E. coli tryptophan , D, C, B, or A genes. Additionally, any SU ATG combination produced by recombinant DNA or other synthetic techniques may be used. In addition to transcription translation signals, an expression vector must also have unique restriction endonuclease sites in correct position to allow insertion of the desired DNA fragment. If the desired site is not present, the plasmid may be modified by aading syntheticDNA linkersw that contain the correct complementary or blunt ends. The ligated recombinant plasmids containing the L1 or L2 gene are used to transform single cell hosts such as bacteria. Transformants are screened for papillomavirus protein production by immunoassay. In the preferred embodiment a polypeptide of the predlcted molecular weight based upon the length of the cloned DNA sequence is identified e.g., by gel electrophoresis of the proteins produced by the transformants that reacts with antibody directed against papillomavirus. In an example of the present invention, a bacterial transformant containing the L1 gene in a recombinant plasmid was identified by the production of a protein of expected size by clones of the transformant.This protein reacted with antibody generated against wholeBPV 1 as measured by immune precipitation. 5.5. EXPRESSION OF PAPILLOMAVIRUS CAPSID PROTEIN GENES Two or more different genes may be joined together using standard DNA cleaving, end modifications and joining techniques e.q., restriction endonuclease,BAL31 nuclease, ExonucleaseIII, S1 nuclease, B. coli DNA polymerase I digestions, G C or A T tailing using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, or ligation with syntheticDNA liners . If gene sequences are constructed such that their coding sequences are ligated in phase with no interrupting termination signals, then subsequent host cell translation of the ligated genes results in production of a fusion protein containing parts of each gene. Gene ligation may allow increased expression of the desired gene product. Highly efficient translation may require the presence or absence of specific regions of sequence complementarity 1downstream from the ATG. Genes which are expressed at high levels e.a., E. coli O galactosidase, recA, trp and bacteriophage lambda cro may have the desirable sequences downstream from its ATG.Gene ligations incorporating the amino terminal portion of genes which are expressed at high levels may allow more efficient translation of the desired gene ligated to it. Gene ligation may also increase the stability of the desired product, i.e. the fusion protein. In bacteria, foreign proteins, especially those of eucaryotes and their viruses, are generally more susceptible to proteolytic degradation than are native procaryotic proteins, therefore, fusion to larger native proteins may protect the desired polypeptide from degradation. In the example of the present invention, the L1 and L2 regions were ligated to the E. coli ss galactosidase gene and or the lambda cro gene resulting in cro Ll ss galactosidase, cro Ll and cro L2 ss galactosidase fusion protein production, respectively. However, any other large procaryotic protein e.g., E. coli, Trp depending on the particular bacterial host, could be used. The recombinant plasmid DNA is used to transform bacteria. Transformants may be screened by looking for the production of a new protein of calculated size extrapolating from the known DNA sequence or by the immune activity of the papillomavirus portion of the fusion protein e.c., gel electrophoresis and or immunoassay .5.6. EVALUATION OF PPILLOMAVIkUS CAPSID FUSION PROTEINS Once the desired transformants are identified, analyses of the immunoreactivity and antigenicity of the products expressed by the transformants te.a., fusion proteins or polypeptides expressed from the Ll or L2 regions are required. Immunological analyses of these expression products are especially important because the ultimate goal is to use the products so produced in vaccine formulations. The analysis of immunoreactivity is most easily carried out using antisera directed against papillomavirus, whereas immunogenicity and antigenicity may be evaluated by determining test animal antisera titers which develop in response to immunization with the product and the ability of the antisera so produced to neutralize papillomavirus infection. Ultimately, clinical studies must be performed on the host animal. These studies will determine whether the vaccine products can inhibit wart formation by clinically induced infection with purified papillomavirus. In the examples of the present invention, the cro ll D galactosidase protein was found to react with antibody directed against BPV 1 ana antibody raised against both cro Ll ss galactosidase and cro L2 8 galactosidase fusion proteins reacted with wholeBPV 1 and neutralized BPV 1 in an in vitro infectivity assay. Additionally, vaccination of cattle with gg Ll B galactosidase fusion proteins inhibited wart formation in animals infected with purified bovine papillomavirus. 5.7. PURIFICATION OF PAPILLOMAVIRUS PROTEINS OR FUSION PROTEINS Transformants containing the desired papillomavirus genetic sequences are cultured and the polypeptides or proteins produced after induction of the promoter are isolated from such cells or from the medium if the proteins are excreted. The proteins can be isolated and purified either by standard chromatography including ion exchange, affinity or sizing resins, by centrifugation, or by any other standard technique for the purification of proteins. Fusion proteins may be isolated from aggregates in the host cell and allow the use of a particularly easy method for isolating them. Such a method involves the separation, extraction and or purification of aggregate forming proteins from the protein mixtures such as lysates of cell cultures by utilizing, consecutively, the steps of cell disruption and differential centrifugation. Highly purified aggregate protein can be obtained at this point. Additionally, the aggregate proteins may be solubilized and reprecipitated.Solubilization of the aggregate forming proteins may be accomplished with a solvent that is both a strong hydrogen acceptor and a strong hydrogen donor or a combination of solvents each having one of these properties , and precipitation of the aggregate forming proteins by dilution with a compatible buffer. Suitable protein solvents include, but are not limited to urea from about 4 M to about 8 M , formamide at least about 80 , volume volume basis , and guanidine hydrochloride from about 4 M to about 8 M .Although guanidine hydrochloriae and other similar agents are denacurants, studies indicate that this denaturation is reversible and that renaturation may occur upon removal by dialysis, for example or dilution of the dnoturant, allowing reformation of an immunologically and or biologically active protein. An example of the fusion protein isolation technique utilized in this invention is outlined as follows the cell pellet is quick frozen using dry ice methanol, weighed, and 3 4 g of cells are resuspended in at least 25 mQ of a buffer solution e.g., 50 hZ Tris Scl ltris hydroxymethylaminomethane hydrochloride , pH 8.0, 2 mN EDTA jethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and 200 mM NaCl . That is, the cells are suspended in a buffer solution at an approximate concentration of from about 100 to 200 grams of cells liter. Concentrations less than about 160 grams liter are preferred.To this suspension lysozyme is added to a final concentration of about 130 pQ mQ and the resulting mixture is allowed to stand at 40C for 20 minutes with occasional snaking.Nonidet P40 NP 40, Shell trademark, polyoxyethylene t93 P tert octylphenol , a non ionic detergent used to solubilizt membranes, is added to a final concentration of about 0.1 and the solution mixed. Then, the suspension is ground for approximately 1 minute using a Polytron homogenizer Brinkman Instruments, Westbury, NY or equivalent. Cell disruption may be accomplished by wide variety of mechanical or non mechonical means or any combination thereof. Thus, the step of cell disruption includes, but is not limited to the use of a Polytron homogenizer, enzymes and chemicals such as lysozymes and detergent, a Gaul in Laboratory Homogenizer GaulinCorporation, Everett, MA , or DYNO Mill Impandex, Inc.,Maywood, NJ . The suspension is centrifuged at 8,000 x g for 30 minutes, and the pellet resuspended in wash buffer, e.g., 20 mM Tris HCl pH 7.2 , 1 mG EDTA, 150 mM NaCI and 2 Triton X 100 polyoxyethylene t9 10 p tert octylphenol, non ionic detergent , and ground using thePolytron homogenizer. This step of centrifugation, washing, and homogenizing may be repeated to further wash the pellet and remove as much cellular debris as desirable. This pellet of aggregates may be resuspended in an appropriate buffer such as phosphate buffered saline PBS 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 150 mMNaCl and used directly as an immunogen, or the fusion protein in the pellet may be solubilized as describea below. In order to solubilize the aggregates the suspension is centrifuged, the supernatant removed completely and the pellet resuspended in about one fifth volume of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride in distilled water or any appropriate buffer . For instance, 3 g of cells washed with 25 mt of buffer should be resuspended at this step in 5 mN of ó M guanidine hyarochloride solution. It may be difficult to resuspend the pellet at this stage and sonication or homogenization may be required in order to obtain a homogeneous solution. The solution is allowed to stand at 220C for 20 minutes and is then centrifuged at 8,000 x g for 30 minutes to remove debris, saving the supernatant which at this point contains the solubilized fusion protein. The fusion protein is precipitated from the guanidine hydrochloride supernatant by the addition of about four volumes of water or aqueous buffer almost any aqueous buffer may be used at this stage . The addition of a small amount of non ionic detergent, such as 0.5 NP 40 or Triton X 100 may be helpful in some cases.This suspension is allowed to stand at 4 C for about 30 minutes and is then centrifuged at 2,000 x g for 10 minutes. The supernatant is discarded, the pellet containing the fusion protein precipitate is resuspenaed in an appropriate buffer, e9r phosphate buffered saline PBS in an appropriate volume. Brief sonication or homogenization may aid in obtaining a homogeneous suspension or slurry since aggregate forming proteins are insoluble in water . It may be desirable to remove any remaining DNk from the suspension of aggregates or the fusion protein precipitate before using either as an immunogen. To this end the suspension of aggregates or fusion protein precipitate is pelleted and resuspended in wash buffer containing no detergent. To either suspension a final concentration of about 10 mM NgCl2 and 2 pg mQ Deoxyribonuclease I P.L. Biochemicals, Milwaukee, WI is added. After incubation at 370C for 30 minutes, the suspension of aggregates or fusion protein precipitate is pelleted by centrifugation, washed with buffer, repelleted, and resuspended in fresh buffer, thus removing most of the deoxyribonuclease. 5.8. FORMULATION OF A PAPILLOMAVIRUS VACCINE The purpose of this invention is to produce, by recombinant DNA techniques, polypeptides related to papillomavirus structural protein which may be used as immunogens in a subunit vaccine to protect against papillomavirus infections. If the protein product elicits an immune response that neutralizes papillomavirus in vitro, it would be expected that this same protein would elicit an immune response capable of neutralizing the relevant virus in vivo. Vaccines made from genetically engineered immunogens should be safer than conventional vaccines made from attenuated or Killed virus because there is no risk of infection of the recipient. Although the papillomavirus ss galactosidase fusion protein product itself may be useful in a vaccine formulation, it may be advantageous to first remove and or modify all or part of the ss galactosidase moiety in order to produce a more effective papillomavirus related immunogen. While whole cells or crude extracts of induced transformants may be used to vaccinate animals, the genetically engineered papillomavirus polypeptide or fusion protein may also be isolated and purified from the host cells using standard protein isolation techniques or techniques previously described see Section 5.7 . In fact, any of the methods usea to isolate aggregates from host cells may be used in vaccine formulations. The final purified product may then be adjusted to an appropriate concentration and formulated with any suitable vaccine adjuvant and packaged for use.Suitable adjuvants incluae but are not limited to surface active substances, e.g., hexadecyl amine, octadecylamine, lysolecithin, dimethyl dioctadecylammonium bromide, N,N dioctadecyl N N bisi2 hydroxyethyl propane diamine , methoxyhexadecylglycerol, and pluronic polyols polyanions, e.q., pyran, dextran sulfate, poly IC, polyacrylic acid, carbopol peptides, e.g., muramyl dipeptide, dimethylglycine, tuftsin oil emulsions and alum. Finally, the protein product may be incorporated into liposomes for use in a vaccine formulation, or may be conjugated to polysaccharides or other polymers. The genetically engineered DNA molecules described herein allow great flexibility for vaccine production. For example, a vaccine could be formulated using a papillomavirus related protein produced by transformants containing any portion of the genetic sequences of papillomavirus encoding a structural protein or multiple copies of such sequences in tandem. The papillomavirus genetic sequences or portion thereof may be ligated to genes that encode other immunogens so that the fused protein product could be used in the preparation of multivalent vaccines. Additionally, the papillomavirus genetic sequences or portions thereof could be ligated to other papillomavirus gene sequences or portions thereof in any combination. Finally, the genetic sequences of papillomavirus may be reorganized to increase the immunogenicity of the vaccine.For example, the papillomavirus genetic sequences may be altered so that the protein product presents specific epitopes to the immune system e.g., an antigenic site of the protein that is normally only partially exposed may be presented to the immune system or the regions of the genetic sequences that encode immunosuppressive portions of the protein can be deleted or the regions that merely separate epitopes can be deleted. 6. EXAMPLE BOVINE PAPILLOMAVIRJS 6.1. GENERAL PROCEDURES Unless otherwise indicatea in the text, the following subsections describe the general procedures and materials utilized in the practice of this example of the present invention. 6.1.1. PLA ID DNA ISOLATION Host cell bacteria Escherichia coli E. coli were transformed Gautier and Bonewald, 1980, Molec. Gen.Genet. 178i 375 and large microgram quantities of plasmid DNA were isolated from cultures of E. coli transformants grown in LB medium Miller, Experiments inMolecular Genetics, Cold Spring Harbor Press, New York,N.Y., 1972 to which casamino acids have been added about 2 g per liter and 0.01 N MgSO4. Plasmids were isolated from cells in late logarithmic stage of growth using the method of Guerry et al. 1973, J. Bacteriol. 116 1063 . 6.1.2. CONDITIONS FOR RESTRICTION ENZYME DIGESTIONS Restriction enzymes used in the present application were obtained commercially. An enzyme unit is defined as the amount required to digest 1.0 yg of lambdaDNA in 60 minutes at 370C in a total reaction mixture of 50 pQ. All restriction enzyme total digestions were performed under the following conditions each 1 p9 DNA was incubated with 5.0 units of enzyme at 37aC for 30 minutes in 6 to 20 pQ buffer. Complete or total digestions were monitored by agarose gel electrophoresis of an aliquot of the reaction mixture. Complete digestion is indicated in each case by the correct size and number of DNA fragments which are detected as discrete bands in the gel. Partial digestions were accomplished by modifyiny the conditions used for total digestion as follows each 1 p9 DNA was incubated with 0.1 units of enzyme at 370C for 15 minute intervals. The fractions selected were those in which an average of one cleavage per DNA molecule was obtained. When restriction enzyme reactions were terminated before electrophoresis, they were terminated by the addition of 0.1t sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS or by heating the reaction mixture at 650C for 10 minutes. 6.1.3. RESTRICTION ENZYME BUFFERS The buffer used for HgiAI digestions consistea of 200 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0 and 10 mM MgCl2. The buffer used for BstEII, EcoRI, and Stul digestions consisted of 10U mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris SCl pH 7.4 , and 10 mM MgSO4. The buffer used for BainHi, HinclI, HindIII, MstI,PstI, PvuII, RsaI, and XmaIII consisted of 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris hCl pH 7.4 , 10 mM MgSO4, and 1 mM dithiothrietol DTT . The buffer used for BglII, Clay, and KpnI consisted of 10mM Tris HCl pH 7.4 , 10 mM MgSO4, and 1 mM DTT. The buffer used for HpaI, Smal and glI consisted of 20 mM KC1, 10 mM Tris ECl pH 8.0 , 10 mM MgSO4, and 1 mM DTT. It should be noted that whenever two or more restriction endonuclease reactions are performed on DNA, the reaction in low salt buffer is accomplished before the reaction in high salt buffer. If two enzymes require the same buffer, then the reactions may be performed simultaneously. 6.1.4. DNA POLYMERASE REACTION DNA polymerases catalyze the stepwise elongation of a DNA chain. Chain growth is in the 5 to 3 direction i.e., addition of nucleotides occurs at the 3 terminus and the sequence of the polymer is determined by that of the template because the incoming nucleotide must be complementary to the template, i.e., form the correct base pair with the template strand. The known DNA polymerases cannot initiate chain synthesis, thus DNA synthesis requires a primer strand with a free 3 hydroxyl terminus annealed to a template strand. Chain elongation proceeds by the nucleophilic attack of the 3 hydroxyl terminus of the primer on the 5 phosphate of the incoming nucleotide. The new chain is base paired and antiparallel to the template strand.As a result of the DNA polymerase reaction the single stranded template strand is filled in or converted to a double stranded DNA molecule. A second important feature of the DNA polymerases is the proof reading function. A 3 to 5 exonuclease activity associated with DNA polymerase I acts on nonbase paired termini and can degrade both single and double stranded DNA in the 3 to 5 direction yielding mononucleotides. Thus an incorrectly added nucleotide is removed before polymerization continues, and the fidelity of the enzyme is further enhanced. DNA polymerase I also has a 5 to 3 exonuclease activity specific for double stranded DNA yielding 5 mononucleotides and oligonucleotides which can also excise mismatched regions in DNA. Proteolytic treatment of DNA polymerase I by the method of Klenow Klenow et al., 1971, Eur. J. Biochem.22 371 yields two fragments, large and small. The large fragment or Klenow fragment 76,000 daltons retains the polymerase and 3 5 exonuclease activity whereas the small fragment retains the 5 3 exonuclease activity.One unit of DNA polymerase I or DNA polymerase I large fragment New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA is defined as the amount converting 10 nmoles of deoxyribonucleotides to an acid insoluble form in 30 minutes at 370C. The assay conditions for both enzymes are the same except tnat tne reaction mixture for DNA polymerase I contains 67 mM KPO4 pH 7.5 while the reaction mixture for the Klenow fragment contains 40 md KPO4 pH 7.5 in the following buffer 6.6 mM Mac12, 1.0 mM 8 NE, 2 mM dAT copolymer, 33 pM dATP, 33 pM B dTTP and enzyme. In the present application, when DNA polymerase large Klenow fragment was used to fill in single stranded DNA or cohesive ends that result from restriction enzyme cleavage, the following procedure was employed restriction enzyme reactions were terminated by heating at 680C for 10 minutes. To the same reaction mixture a final concentration of 50 UN of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate was added and for each microgram of DNA in the reaction mixture 10 100 units ofDNA polymerase Klenow fragment was added. In other words an excess of DNA polymerase Klenow fragment was used to ensure that single stranded ends were completely filled in. 6.1.5. BAL31 NUCLEAR REACTION BAL3l nuclease is a multifunctional enzyme that contains a highly specific single stranded endodeoxyribonuclease activity and a processive exonuclease activity that simultaneously degrades both the 3 and 5 termini of double stranded DNA dsDNA . One unit of nuclease BAL31 New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA is defined as the amount required to release 1.0 pg of acid soluble nucleotides from denatured calf thymus DNA 650 pg mQ in one minute at 300C. The reaction buffer used for BAL31 consisted of 20 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0 , 600 mM NaCl, 12 mM CaCl2, 12 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA and DNA.Incubations were at 300C BAL31 digests were accomplished by incubating 30 pg of DNA with 0.5 units BAL31 for 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 minutes.Reactions were terminated by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 50 mM or by the addition of an equal volume of phenol equilibrated with 10 mM Tris uCl pH 7.5 , 5 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA or phenol equilibrated with 20 znM Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mM NaCl, and 20 mSi EDTA . 6.1.6. DNA LIGATION All ligations were accomplished using T4 DNa ligase New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, Mh . One unit of T4 DNA ligase is defined as the amount requirea to yield 50 ligation of HindIII fragments of bacteriophage lambda DNA in 30 minutes at 16 C in 20 Pt of ligase buffer and a 5 DNA terminus concentration of 0.12 PM 300 g mt . Unless otherwise indicated, DNA ligations were carried out in ligase buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris HCl pH 7.8 , 10 mM MgCl2 60 me b ME, 1.0 mM ATP and a DNA concentration ranging from 15 30 pg mQ. Ligation reactions were incubated 24 hours at room temperature or 20 hours at 150C using approximately 300 units of T4 DNA ligase per 10 ut reaction volume. 6.1.7. GEL PURIFICATION OF DNA FRAGMENTS After restriction enzyme or nuclease treatment,DNA fragments of varying sizes were separated by gel electrophoresis in low melting temperature agarose LTAt Bethesda Research Laboratories, Inc., Rockville, MD .After separation the gel was stained with ethidium bromide at 1 pg mQ and the DNA fragments were visualized by exposure to long wavelength ultraviolet light. The desired DNA fragments were extracted from the gel as follows the band containing the desired DNA fragment was carefully cut out of the ethidium bromide stained gel and melted at 650C for 20 minutes in the presence of an equal volume of TE 10 EM Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA t the mixture was extracted with an equal volume of TE saturated phenol, followed by an extraction using an equal volume of chloroform isoamyl alcohol solution at a 24 1 volume ratio DNA was concentrated by adding 2 volumes of butanol isopropanol solution at a 7 3 volume ratio, ethanol precipitated and resuspended in TE. 6.1.8. ELUTION OF PROTEINS FROM POLYACRYLkIDE GEL Cellular proteins were separated in polyacrylamide gels by electrophoresis as described byLaemmli 1970, Nature 227 680 . After separation, about 1 cm was cut away from each side of the gel in a pattern that allowed subsequent realignment of the slice to the gel in its original position. The gel slices were then stained and de stained as per standard procedure and re aligned with the remaining portion of the gel. Using the stained gel sides as guides, desired unstained protein was cut out from the large portion of the gel.The gel slice containing the protein of interest was cut into small pieces 2 mum2 and eluted three times, overnight at 370C in an equal volume of a buffer containing 0.1 SDS and 50 mM NS4SCO3, pH 8.5. The eluant was then concentrated by dialyzing under vaccuum using immersible CX Ultrafilters as the dialysis membrane Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA . Dialysis was repeated three times, for 12 to 18 hours at room temperature against two liters of a buffer containing 1 mM EDTA, 108 glycerol, 5 methanol, 0.05 Triton X 100 Rohm Haas Co., Philadelphia, PA and 10 mM Tris hCi, pH 7.2. A final dialysis was done one time, for 6 to 8 hours at room temperature against one liter of a buffer containing 1 mM EDTA, 50 glycerol, 40 mM NaCI and 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.2. 6.1.9. BINARY ETHYLENES IMINE INACTIVATION OF BACTERIA Vaccine materials were inactivated with binary ethylene imine BEl as follows equal volumes of 0.2 M 2 bromoethylamine Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO and 0.4 M NaOB were combined and incubated at 370C for 60 minutes. Since this reaction generates BEI which is carcinogenic, all manipulations were done in a fume boot while wearing gloves. One tenth volume of Bt I from the first step was added to materials to be inactivated and incubated at 370C for 4 hours with shaking. Any residualBEI was inactivated by adding 1 M sodium thiosulfate in volume equal to that of BEI in the second step.Inactivated materials were then used for vaccine formulation. 6.2. ISOLATION AND CLONING OF TdX BOVINE PAPILLOMAVIRUS GNOME The following subsections describe the molecular cloning of the entire BPV genome using pBR322 as the cloning vehicle. BPV was isolated from wart tissues of infected cattle. The BPV DNA was isolated and cleaved at its unique restriction site, EcoRI. The linearized BPV DNA i.e., the entire BPV genome was then ligated into the EcoRI site of pBR322. 6.2.1. PURIFICATION OF BOVINE PAPfLLOMAVIRS DNA Papillomas were excised and rinsed in 50 glycerol NaCl at 40C. The wart tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen and broken into small pieces by hammering the tissue sandwiched between sheets of aluminum foil.Then 6 g of the papilloma tissue were suspended in 20 me buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5 , 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA. The suspension was homogenized in a Polytron grinder Brinkman Instruments, Westbury, NY two times for 10 seconds at 40C at a setting of 6. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,500 x g for 15 minutes at 40C, the supernatant was removed and saved supernatant 1 ana the pellet was resupended in 10 mss of 0.1 M Tris HCl pH 7.5 , 0.25 Sarkosyl N lauroyl sarcosine . A 10 m aliquot ofFreon 1,1,2 trichloro 1,2,2 trifiuoroethane was aaded to the suspension which was then homogenized in a Polytron grinder at 40C for 10 seconds at a setting of 6.The debris and Freon were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,500 x g for 5 minutes at 40C. The supernatant was combined with supernatant 1 and the mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 15 minutes at 40C. The pellet was resuspended in 2 m of 50 nl Tris L1C1 pH 7.5 , 100 mM NaCl and used for clinical studies see Section 6.9.4 . The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 140,000 x g for 1.5 hours at 40C in order to pellet the virus particles.The pellet containing virus was resuspended in 1 mQ of 0.1 M Tris ECl ph 7.5 , 10 mMCaCl2, 10 mM MgCl2 and CsCl 1.33 g mQ and centrifuyed at 140,000 x g for 40 hours at 200C in order to band the virus. Fractions 200 pQ were collected and the refractive index of each fraction at O.D.260 and O.D.280 was determined in order to identify the fraction which contained the virus. To this end a 5 PQ aliquot of each fraction was diluted with 150 pt of distilled water and the absorbances at O.D.260 and O.D.280 were determined an O.D.260 O.D.280 ratio of 0.7 indicated the fraction which contained the virus.The virus fraction was then dialyzed twice against 0.15 M NaCl, 15 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0. DNA was isolated from purified bovine papillomavirus BPV by disruptiny the virus with 0.58 SDS and extracting the DNA with phenol. Tne DNA was further purified by ether extraction and ethanol precipitation. The DNA was determined to be from SPV type 1 BPV 1 by restriction endonuclease digestion, using EcoRI and HincII, followed by analysis of fragment sizes by agarose gel electrophoresis restriction enzyme mapping Johnson, 1977, Biochem. 16 4217 . A map of the BPV 1 genome is depicted in FIG. 1. 6.2.2. MOLECULAR CLONING OF BOVINE PAPILLOMAVIRUS GENOMIC DNA The purified BPV 1 DNA FIG. 2 was digested to completion with the restriction endonuclease EcoRI.Complete or total digestion of genomic BPV 1 DNA resulted in a single linear DNA fragment with ScoRI cohesive termini. The EcoRI cleaved BPV 1 DNA was phenol extracted twice, ether extracted twice, ethanol precipitated and resuspended in 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0 , 1 mM EDTA TE . Plasmid vector pBR322 FIG. 2 Bolivar et al., 1977, Gene 2 95 113 was isolated and cleaved with EcoRI. The resultant linear pBR322 DNA was phenol extracted and resuspended as described above for BPV 1 DNA. The cleaved BPV 1 DNA and the cleaved pBR322 plasmid DNA were ligated in a 1 1 molar ratio at a final total concentration of 15 ng uL using T4 DNA ligase as described in Section 6.1.6. The plasmids resulting from ligation were used to transform E. coli t12, strain MC1000 by the procedure ofKushner 1978 in, Proceedings of the InternationalSymposium of Genetic Engineering and clones were screened for ampicillin resistance. Plasioid DNA isolated from ampicillin resistantE. coli clones were analyzed for the presence of BPV 1 DNA by restriction endonuclease mapping using EcoRI. One transformant, designated pWPl l, contained the entire BPV genomic DNA. Restriction mapping of the recombinant plasmid isolated from clones of this transformant revealed that total digestion with EcoRI yielded two fragments approximately 7945 bp i.e., the BPV DNA and 4362 bp i.e., the pBR322 DNA . 6.3. IDENTIFICATION OF THE BPV CAPSID PROTEIN GENES L1 and L2 Portions of BPV 1 DNA were sequenced according to the method of Maxam and Gilbert, 1980, Methods inEnzymology 65 499 560 . This BPV 1 DNA sequence data as well as that reported in the literature Chen et al., 1982, Nature 299 529 534 were analyzed to identify the location of the L1 and L2 regions which were found to be within a 3687 bp fragment defined by restriction endonuclease sites KpnI and Hincll. This area of the genome contains two large ATG initiated open reading frames of 1488 bp and 1410 bp corresponding to regions L1 and L2, respectively.The major portions of the L1 and L2 open reading frames are also located within a region identified as not being required for in vitro cell transformation Lowy et al., 1980, Nature 287 72 74 . See also FIG. 3 for nucleotide sequence data of the L1 and L2 genes. 6.4. CLONING AND EXPRESSION OF THE L1 GENE A portion of the L1 gene hereinafter the L1 gene and portions thereof will be referred to as L1 DNA , lacking the initiation sequence A and approximately the first 78 nucleotides of the coding sequence was ligated into a DNA cloning expression vector, pMG10S, to form pBPDl8. The L1 DNA was inserted so that the protein coding sequence was in tne correct reading frame with respect to the initiation ATG of the vector.As a result, subsequent translation of the transcribed rnRNAbegins at the initiation sequence ATG of the vector through tne L1 gene lacking its own initiation ATG and the first 68 nucleotides of the L1 coding sequence to the natural termination signal of the L1 gene. 6.4.1. THE EXPRESSION VECTOR pMG105 The expression vector pMG105 see FIG. 4 was constructed from pJS413 U.S. Patent Applications Ser. No. 400,028 filed, July 20, 1982 ber. No. 436,368 filed, October 25, 1982 Ser. No. 449,187 filed,December 13, 1982 and Ser. No. 456,423 filed, January 7, 1982 and pBR325 Bolivar, 1978, Gene 4 121 136 .It contains the following the E. coli lac promoter with UV5 mutation, lac and cro ribosome binding sites S ss Z and cro are represented in zSDcro are represented in all figures as SDz and SDCrO, respectively and the carboxy terminal region of the tetracycline resistance gene tetr . A BqlII, SmaI and BamHI site are located in between the cro and tet r sequences these sites allow for insertion of a gene sequence in the correct reading frame with the cro ATG. pig105 DNA was digestea to completion with restriction endonuclease Smal followed by BamHI. TheDigestion of pMG1OS with the enzymes SmaI and BamHI yielded a linear molecule of about 4188 bp which was purified by agarose gel electropnoresis using LTA as described in Section 6.1.7. This DNA molecule had a SmaI blunt end and a BamHI cohesive end. 6.4.2. PREPARTION OF THE L1 GENE Plasmid pWPl l DNA was isolated and digested to completion with restriction endonuclease PvuII see FIG.4 . The PvuII digested DNA was phenol extracted, ether extracted, ethanol precipitated and resuspended in 10 mM Tris SCl pH 8.0 , 1 mM EDTA TE . The PvuII site of interest i.e., the cleavedPvuII site within pWPl l is located approxlmately 563 bp upstream from the initiation ATG of the L1 gene thereore, it was necessary to remove at least the 563 bp before ligating the pWP1 1 fragment to the lambda cro gene of the expression vector. Thus, a minimum of 563 bp was removed using the nuclease BAL3l Bethesda Research Laboratories,Inc., Rockville, MD as described in Section 6.1.5.Samples were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to determine the extent of DNA digestion. It was found that incubation for six minutes had removed approximately the correct amount of DNA, and the DNA of this aliquot was ether extracted, ethanol precipitated and resuspended in TE. The BAL31 digested pWPl l DNA was then completely cleaved with the restriction endonuclease BamHI.Completion of the reaction was monitored by agarose gel electrophoresis and fragments, approximately 4900 bp in length, were purified from low melting temperature agarose LTA Bethesda Research Laboratories, Inc., Rockville, MD as described in Section 6.1.7. The purifiea DNA consisted of a population of DNA fragments of varying sizes because of the random BAL31 digestion. These purified DNA fragments contained the L1 gene and had a blunt end located at random sites within the ATG proximal region of the L1 gene and a BamHI cohesive end at the distal end of the fragment. This distal end region also contained the transcription and translation signals and amino terminal portion of the tetracycline resistance gene see FIG. 4 . 6.4.3. LIGATION OF THE Ll GENE AND EXPRESSION VECTOR The cleaved pig105 and the 4900 bp fragment containing L1 DNA were then ligated at a 1 1 molar ratio at a final DNA concentration ot 24 ng Reaction conditions were as described in Section 6.1.6. The plasmids resulting from ligation were used to transformE. coli K12, strain NF1829, as described previously inSection 6.2.4. The E. coli strain NF1829 is a K 12 MC1000 derivative carrying an F lac episome with the lac mutation for lac repressor overproduction. The lac z gene encoding B galactosidase present on the F lac episome is inactivated by a Tn 5 transposon insertion. Thus, in strain NF1829, the lac promoter must be induced in order to obtain expression of a gene inserted into the pig105 plasmid. 6.4.4. IDENTIFICATION OF TRANSFORMANTS CONTAINING THE L1 GENE The PvuII BamHI DNA fragment approximately 4900 bp purified from pWPl l in Section 6.4.2. contains the transcription and translation signals and the amino terminal portion of the tetracycline resistance gene, whereas the BamHI SmaI pig105 DNA fragment approximately 4188 bp contains the carboxy terminal portion of the tetracycline resistance gene therefore, the tet r gene is restored in the recombinant plasmids resulting from ligation. As a result, transformants were screened for tetracycline resistance. Recombinant plasmid DNA was purified from tetracycline resistant clones and the isolated DNA was completely digested with the restriction endonuclease BqlII. The resulting DNA restriction fragments were then analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The desired constructions contain five BglII DNA fragments four of these fragments should be the same size in all isolates 5152 bp, 2515 bp, 670 bp, and 26 bp. The fifth fragment may vary from 641 bp to four base pairs, depending on the amount of DNA removed by the BAL3l nuclease digestion. Five isolates were identified which had the correct four nonvariable size BglIT DNA fragments 5152, 2515, 670 and 26 bp . One isolate, designated pBPDlS seeFIG. 4 had a fifth BqlII fragment of approximately 573 bp indicating that about 68 bp including the ATG of the Ll gene had been removed from the beginning of the bPV l L1 gene. 6.4.5. IDENTIFICATION OF TRANSFORMANTs EXPRESSING THE L1 GENE Transformants containing pBPDl8 were identified as expressors of the L1 gene. As explained in Section 6.4.4., the blunt end of the DNA fragment containing L1 gene was produced at random sites within the L1 coding sequence, therefore, ligation to the cro sequence of the expression vector resulted in a mixture of recombinant plasmids. In some of these, the L1 gene was inserted so that the protein coding sequence was in the correct reading frame with respect to the cro initiation ATS of the vector and thus would encode a cro Ll fusion protein.Since the code is reaa in triplets of DNA bases, it would be expected that, on the average only one out of three of these isolates would produce a cro Ll fusion protein.Thus, the five isolates containing BPV 1 DNA from Section 6.4.4. were screened for expression of an antigenicaly active peptide of BPV by immunoprecipitation techniques using purified IgG directed against BPV 1. Cell lysates of E. coli transformed with plasmid pBPD18 reacted inununologically with the anti BPV l IgG, whereas E. coli transformed with four other isolates or a pig105 control did not. In addition, SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the immunoprecipitated proteins showed a band corresponding to a protein of the size expected based upon the length of the cro Ll DNA sequence .Therefore, pBPD18 was demonstrated to encode aBPV l antigenically active cro Ll protein. 6.5. PREPARATION OF pC2Vl WHICH DIRECTS TdE PRODUCTION OF CRO Ll ss GALACTOSIDASE FUSION PROTEIN As described in the following subsections, a DNA fragment of pBPDl8 encoding the transcriptional and translational controls and the cro Ll fusion protein without its termination signal TAA was ligated to the ss galactosidase coding sequence z gene of the expression vector pHK413. After ligation, the translational reading frame was adDu5ted so that the reading frame of cro Ll was in phase with that of the z gene of pHK413. The resultant plasmid, pC2Vl, directed host cell production of a cro Ll ss galactosidase fusion protein. 6.5.1. THE EXPRESSION VECTOR pHK413 The expression vector pHK413 6485 bp or about 6.5 k.b. is a pBR322 derivative which contains the ampr 8 lactamase gene, a lac promoter Plac , lac and cro ribosome binding sites SDZ and SDcro, respectively , a chain initiation ATG derived from cro followed by 65 nucleotides of the cro gene, and a modified ss galactosidase gene see FIG. 5 . The pH413 expression vector is described in detail in a U.S. Patent ApplicationSer. No. 449,187, filed December 13, 1982, which is herein incorporated by reference . pHK413 has unique cloning sites which span tne cro z junction BqlII, Hindlil, Smal, and BamHI. The z gene is not in phase with the cro ATG, thus, the intact plasmid does not direct the production of 8 galactosidase. However, when a DNA fragment of the appropriate length is inserted into any of these cloning sites on the plasmid, the reading frame of the z gene may be readjusted with respect to the cro ATG and, provided that the inserted DNA sequence contains no termination signals e.g., TGA, TAA, or TAG that are in phase with the cro ATG or z gene, a ss galactosidase fusion protein will be produced by host cell transformants.Accordingly, insertion of a 3n 2 bp DNA fragment between the cro ATS and z gene of pHK413 results in a readjustment of the reading frames and production of a fusion protein in the host cell transformant, provided the inserted sequences do not contain termination signals in the same reading frame. The inserted DNA sequence and or the cloning sites of pHK413 may be altered in any fashion in order to readjust the reading frame across the cro z junction. Plasmid pHK413 see FIG. 5 was purified as described in Section 6.1.1. and completely digested with the restriction endonucleases BinaIII and PstI. The resulting DNA fragment about 5.5 k.b. containing a Hindlil cohesive end, the E. coli B galactosidase gene, the carboxy terminal portion of the b lactamase gene ampr and a PstI cohesive end was isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis and purified from the LTA gel as described in Section 6.1.7. 6.5.2. INSERTION OF THE L1 GENE INTO pHK413 Plasmid pBPD18 FIG. 5 was isolated as described in Section 6.1.1. and completely digested with restriction endonuclease HindIlI followed by complete digestion withPstI. After agarose gel electrophoresis, a DNA fragment of about 2240 bp was purified from the LTA as described inSection 6.1.7. This fragment contained a PstI cohesive end, the amino terminal portion and all transcriptional and translational signals for the amPr gene, the lac transcriptional signals, the cro translational signals, the cro Ll sequence and a HindlIl cohesive end. The DNA fragments from pBPDl8 and pHK418 were then ligated at a 1 1 molar ratio at a final total DNA concentration of 25 ng pL. Reaction conditions were as described in Section 6.1.6. The ligated DNA was used to transform E. coli K12, strain NF1829, as described inSection 6.1.1. 6.5.3. IDENTIFICATION OF TRANSFORNANTS CONTAINING CRO Ll ss GALACTOSIDASE DNA The Pstl HindIII pBPD18 DNA fragment Section 6.5.2. contained the transcription and translational signals as well as the amino terminal portion of the ss lactamase gene, which provides ampicillin resistance.The 8indIII PstI pHK413 DNA fragment from Section 6.5.1.contains the portion of the ss lactamase gene missing from the pBPD18 DNA fragment. When ligated the desired recombinant plasmid generates a complete ss lactamase gene amps therefore, transformants were selected for ampicillin resistance. Plasmid DNA from ampicillin resistant isolates was purified as per Section 6.1.1., cleaved by restriction endonucleases HindIIf and PstI, and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. One such isolate, designated pC2B9 produced two fragments of about 5500 bp and 2240 bp. 6.5.4. ADJUSTING THE TRANSLATIONAL READING FRAME The DNA sequence of portions of pC2B9 revealed that the B galactosidase gene was not in translational reading frame with the cro L1 DNA sequence. Therefore, it was necessary to adjust the reading frame of the z gene to be in phase with that of the L1 gene. This was done as follows plasmid pC2B9 was isolated as per Section t.1.1. and completely digested with restriction endonucleaseHindIII. The Hindlil cohesive termini were rendered blunt ended by filling in with the Klenow fragment otE. coli DNA polymerase I as per Section 6.1.4. This resulted in elimination of the HindIII cohesive termini and the creation of blunt ends on the DNA fragment. The blunt ends were joined by ligation as described in Section 6.1.6 see FIG. 5 . The plasmids formed in the ligation reaction were used to transform E. coli K12 strain NF1829 as per Section 6.1.1. 6.5.5. IDENTIFICATION OF THANSFORMklUTS EXPRESSING CRO L1 ss GALACTOSIDASE FUSION PROTEIN Transformants from ligation above were screened on MacConkey agar Difco Labs, Inc., Detroit, MI containing ampicillin. Colonies producing a D galactosidase fusion protein would be a red color and other colonies would be white. Total cell lysates were prepared from five red colonies. The proteins isolated from these cell lysates were analyzed by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis SDS PAGE . All five isolates produced a large protein of the expected size, about 170,000 daltons molecular weight, while the controls white colonies did not. One isolate producing the large fusion protein was designated pC2Vl. pC2V1 plasmid DNA see FI. 5 was purified from this isolate as per Section 6.1.1. The pC2Vl plasmid was treated with either Hindlil or with a combination of PstI and BamHI as per Sections 6.1.2. and 6.1.3. As expectedHindIII did not cleave pC2Vl, while digestion with PstI and BamHI produced two fragments ot about 5550 bp and 2240 bp. 6.6. CONSTRUCTION OF pBPT307 WHICH DIRECTS THE HIGH LEVEL PRODUCTION OF CkO L1 FUSION PROTEIN As described in the following subsections, a DNA fragment of pBPD18 encoding the cro Ll fusion protein was ligated to a DNA fragment of the expression vector pDRS4O encoding the transcriptional and translational controls.The resultant plasmid, pBPT307, directed host cell production of a high level of cro Ll fusion protein. 6.6.1. REDUCING THE SIZE OF pBPD18 The construction of pBPT307 required the isolation of a small 332 bp RsaI generated DNA fragment from pBPD18. pBPD18 contained fourteen RsaI sites, thus, the isolation of the needed fragment would have been difficult. For this reason the size of pBPDlB was reducea by cloning a portion of the plasmid into pBR322. Plasmid pBPDl8 FIG. 6 was isolated as described in Section 6.1.1. and completely digested with restriction endonuclease HincIl. After agarose gel electrophoresis, aDNA fragment of about 2588 bp was purified from LTA as described in Section 6.1.7. This fragment contained a BincII blunt end, the amino terminal portion and all transcriptional and translational signals for the amDr gene, the lac transcriptional signals, the cro translational signals, the cro Ll sequence and an Hincil blunt end. Plasmid pBR322 FIG. 6 was isolated as described in Section 6.1.1. and completely digested with Hincli. Atter agarose gel electrophoresis, a DNA fragment of 3256 bp was purified from LTA as described in Section 6.1.7.This fragment contained an HincII blunt end, the carboxy terminal portion of the ampr gene and an HincII blunt end. The DNA fragments from pBPDl8 and pBR322 were then ligated in equal concentration at a final total concentration of 25 ng Reaction conditions were as described in section 6.1.b. The ligated DNA was used to transform E. coli K12, strain MC1000, as described inSection 6.1.1. 6.6.2. IDENTIFICATION OF TRANSFORZNTS CONTAINING CRO L1 DNA The HincII pBPD18 DNA fragment Section 6.1.1. contained the transcription and translational signals as well as the amino terminal portion of the B lactamase gene, which provides ampicillin resistance. The HincII pBR322 DNA fragment from Section 6.6.1. contained the portion of the 8 lactamase gene missing from the pbPD18DNA fragment. When ligated, the desired recombinant plasmid generated a complete B lactamase gene ampr therefore, transformants were selected for ampicillin resistance. Plasmid DNA from ampicillin resistant isolates was purified as per Section 6.1.1., cleaved by restriction endonuclease HincII, and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. One such isolate, designated pBPD18 25 FIG. 6 produced two fragments of about 3256 bp and 25EB bp, which indicated the correct construction had been obtained. 6.6.3. INSERTION OF THE AMINO TERMINAL PORTION OF THE CRO L1 GENE INTO pDR54U The expression vector p9R540 about 4100 bp contains the amp 8 lactamase gene, a hybrid trp promoter lac operator Ptac , the lac ribosome binding site 5Dlac and the qalK galactose kinase gene seeFIG. 7 . This plasmid was obtained commercially from P.L. Biochemicals, Inc., Milwaukee, WI. pDR540 had a unique BamHI site immediately downstream from the SDlac. When a DNA fragment, containing a gene with its ATG appropriately close to the S ss proximal end, is inserted into the BamHI site, the gene is expressed at high levels by the hybrid tac promoter. Plasmid pDR540 was isolated as per Section 6.1.1.and completely digested with restriction endonucleaseBamHI. Tne BamHI cohesive termini were rendered blunt ended by filling in with the Klenow fragment ofE. coli DNA polymerase I as per Section 6.1.4. This resulted in elimination of the BamHI cohesive termini and the creation of blunt ends on the DNA fragment. The linearized, blunt ended plasmid was isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis and purified from LTA gel as described in Section 6.1.7. Plasmid pBPD18 FI. 7 was isolated as described in Section 6.1.1. and completely digested with restriction endonuclease RsaI. After agarose gel electrophoresis, a DNA fragment of about 332 bp was purified frm LTA as described inSection 6.1.7. This fragment contained a RsaI blunt end, the SDcro,the ATG and the amino terminal portion of the cro LI gene fusion, and a RsaI blunt end. The DNA fragments from pRPD18 25 and pDR540 were then ligated in equal concentration at a final total DNA concentration of 25 ng Q. Reaction conditions were as described in Section 6.1.6. The ligated DNA was used to transform E. coli K12, strain NF1829, as describea inSection 6.1.1.6.6.4. IDRNTIFICATION OF TRANSFORNTS CONTAINING THE TAC PROMOTER AND THE AMINO TERMINAL PORTION OF CRO L1 The linearizeÅa pDR540 DNA contained the complete ss lactamase gene, which provide ampicillin resistance therefore, transformants were selected for ampicillin resistance. Plasmid DNA from ampicillin resistant isolates was purified as per Section 6.1.1., cleaved by restriction enaonucleases t.coRI and B91II, and analyzea by agarose gel electrophoresis. One such isolate, designated pBPT13 FIG. 7 produced two fragments of about 4000 bp and 432 bp which indicated that the 332 bp RsaI DNA fragment from pBPD18 25 had been inserted in the correct orientation. 6.6.5. RECONSTRUCTION OF THE L1 GENE STEP 1 Because of the absence of a useful restriction endonuclease site within the portion of the L1 gene present in pBPT13, it was necessary to reconstruct the complete L1 gene in two steps. In the first step plasmid pBPT13 see FIG. 8 was purified as described in Section 6.1.1. and completely digested with the restriction endonuclease BalII. The resulting linear plasmid DNA, containing SQ1II cohesive ends was isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis and purified from LTA gel as described in Section 6.1.7. Plasmid pBPD18 25 see FIG. 8 was purified as described in Section 6.1.1. and completely digested with the restriction endonuclease BqlII. A fragment of about 560 bp, containing a portion of the L1 gene, including a Stul site and cohesive i1II ends, was isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis and purified from LTA gel as described in Section 6.1.7. The DNA fragments from pBPD18 25 and pBPR13 were then ligated in equal concentration at a final total DNA concentration of 25 ng pD. Reaction conditions were as described in Section 6.1.6.

FUSION PROTEIN IMMUNOREACTS WITH ANTI BPV 1 HUM The cro Ll ss galactosidase fusion protein produced by pC2V1 transformants was separated from other cellular proteins by SDS PAGE. The fusion proteins were eluted from the gels and concentrated by the procedure described in Section 6.1.8. The purified cro Ll ss galactosidase fusion protein of pC2Vl reacted positively with antibody directed against whole BPV 1 when assayed by the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA Voller, A. et al., in Manual of Clinical Immunoloqy, 2dEd., Rose and Friedman, Eds., ASM, Washington, DC 1980 359 371 .Details are described below. Rabbit antiserum directed against whole BPV 1 was produced as follows 0.6 mt of purified BPV 1 virus seeSection 6.2.1 at a total protein concentration of 1 mg mQ determined by a colorimetric assay, Lowry ot al., 1951, 3. Biol. Chem. 193s265 275 was combined with 0.9 mQ complete Freund s adjuvant. After vortexing, the mixture was gently shaken overnight in order to form an emulsion, and 0.75 mll approximately 300 g BPV 1 was injected intramuscularly into a New Zealand rabbit.After 28 days the rabbit was boosted with 0.25 mll of bPV 1 100 ug BPV 1 prepared as above suspended in incomplete Freund s adjuvant. Serum was collected 7 days after the boost ana analyzed by ELISA using purified BPV 1 as antigen. Tne boosts were repeated and serum collected and analyzed two more times until the animal demonstrated a high titer of antibody directed against BPV 1 anti XPV l . The enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, or ELISA, was performed using as antigen the cro Ll ss galactosidase fusion protein produced by pC2V1 transformants or pciVl fusion protein as follows the pC2Vl fusion protein was diluted to 50 pg mQ in fresh carbonate buffer stock carbonate buffer 0.635 g Na2CO3, 0.504 g NaHCO3 in 250 mQ B2 Then 100 aliquots of the pC2V1 antigen solution was added to 6 wells of a microtiter plate which was incubated overnight at 370C to allow the pC2V1 fusion protein to adsorb to the wells. The wells were then washed with Tween Buffer 146.1 g NaCl, 200 m 0.5 M Na2HPO4, 25 mQ Tween 20 polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate and distilled water to 1000 mQ total volume.Pre immune serum, and rabbit anti BPV 1 serum were each serially diluted 1 10, 1 100, 1 1000 with Tween buffer.Each of the 6 microtiter wells received a 50 aliquot of one serum dilution. After incubating at room temperature for 30 minutes with shaking a 100 pQ aliquot of peroxidase labeled goat anti rabbit Ig solution was added and the wells were incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes with shaking.The wells were washed three times with Tween buffer and 100 pQ freshly made OPD indicator was added to each of the six wells 5 mg OPD Orthophenyldiamine in 12.5 mQ OPD buffer 25 mQ 0.1 M citrate, 9.5 mQ 0.5 M Na2iiPO4 and 65.5 mQ H2O plus 5 pQ 30 H20. After a 15 minute incubation at room temperature, a 100 pt aliquot of 2.5 M H2504 was added to each well. The color intensity of the wells was recorded and photographed. 6.9.2. ANTISERA DIRECTED AGAINT FUSION PROTEINS IMMUNOREACT WITH BPV 1 PROTEINS Rabbit antisera were generated against each fusion protein as follows the cro Ll ss galactosidase fusion protein produced by pC2V1 transformants and the cro L2 ss galactosidase fusion protein produced by pFU41 transformants were separated from other cellular proteins by SDS PAGE. After SDS PAGE, the proteins were visualizea by staining the outer lanes with coomassie blue dye then the fusion proteins were sliced from the gels as described in Section 6.1.8 . Each gel slice was immersed in liquid nitrogen, ground to a powder and then each was suspended in an equal volume of Freuna s complete adjuvant.After thorough mixing, the solutions were injected subcutaneously into two stew Zealand rabbits.Each rabbit was injected with lOU to 300 g protein.After 28 days, the rabbits were boosted with the same fusion protein suspended in incomplete Freund s adjuvant.The animals were boosted 2 more times. The sera hereinafter referred to as anti pC2Vl serum and anti pFU41 serum collected 63 days after the initial injection were analyzed for immunoreactivity with BPV 1 proteins by ELISA assays described in 6.9.1 using BPV 1 proteins as antigen and by immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled BPV 1 proteins described below . BPV 1 proteins were radiolabeled with 1251 using the solid phase lactoperoxidase glucose oxidase system for radioiodination Enzymobeads, BioRadLaboratories, Richmond, CA in a final reaction volume of 200 pt as follows BPV 1 was isolated from wart tissue and puritied in a CsCl gradient as previously described final preparation containing approximately 2 mg mll total protein .The following was added to 50 uL Enxymobeads which were reconstituted as per instructions in a 1.5 m microcentrifuge tube 6 pQ of 5 N NaCl i.e., 150 mM final concentration , 50 pt of 0.2 M sodium phosphate pH 7.2 , and 10 125I 100 mCi mM, New EnglandNuclear, Boston, MA , 10 UL of the purified BPV 1, and distilled water to a final volume of 170 pL. To initiate the reaction 30 pQ of 2 glucose i.e., 1 ss D glucose and 1 alpha D glucose prepared one day in advance was added to the Enzymobead reaction vessel.The reaction mixture was incubated for 1 hour at 300C with intermittant shaking. The solid phase enzymo beads were pelleted by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge approximately 15,000 x g for 1 minute. The supernatant was applied to a 20 mQ column comprising G 50 Sephadex a bead formed gel consisting of dextran cross linked with epichlorohydrin Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Piscataway, NJ in PBS phosphate buffered saline and 100 mg m BSA bovine serum albumin .A fast moving peak of incorporated 125I separated from the unincorporated 1251. The 125I labeled BPV 1 in the fast moving peak was used for immunoprecipitation analysis of the rabbit antisera directed against each fusion protein as follows A 10 pQ aliquot of 125I BPV l was mixed with 0.5 mll 20 SDS SDS final concentration of 1 and was incubated at 370C for 30 minutes.Then 1 mD of RIPA buffer 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.2, 1 Triton X lOU, 14 deoxycholate and 11 SDS was adaed to the mixture which was then distributed into microcentrifuge tubes in 50 mA aliquots. Each antiserum tested anti pC2Vl, anti pFU41, and pre immune sera as controls was added to an individual aliquot of 125I BPV l prepared as above and incubated at 40C for 60 minutes. During the 60 minute incubation period a 10 suspension of protein A containing Staphylococcus aureus cells was washed twice with B buffer 120 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0 , 0.58 NP 40 once with B buffer containing 0.5 M Liy12, and once more with B buffer without LiC12. The washed S. aureus was resuspended inB buffer to its original volume and ovalbumin was added to a final concentration of 1 mg mL. The washed S. aureus was added to each antiserum mixture in an amount equal to 5 times the volume of antiserum used and the mixture was incubated at 40C for 20 minutes. The immune complexes were pelleted by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge 15,000 x g and washed with B buffer containing 0.5 M Lid2, followed byB buffer. The finial pellets were resuspended in gel sample buffer consisting of 10t 8 ME, 0.14 N Tris ECl pS 6.8 , 22.4 glycerol, 6 SDS and 0.01 bromophenol blue and boiled for one minute. After removal of insoluble debris by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge, the material was electrophoresed in SDS polyacrylamide gels containing 10t polyacrylamide Laemmli, 1970, Nature 227 680 . The gels were prepared for fluorography by soaking in sodium salicylate Chamberlain, 1979, Anal.BioChem 98 132 ano the dried gels were exposed to Dupont Cronex 4 X ray film at 70 C. Results of fluorography demonstrated that each rabbit antiserum immunoprecipitated the BPV 1 structrual proteins while the pre immune sera did not. In fact, both antisera snti pC2Yl and pFU41 reacted positively againstBPV 1 as demonstrated by both ELISA and the immune precipitation described above. 6.9.3. ANTISERA DIRECTED AGAINST FUSION PROTEINS INHIBIT CELL TRANSFORMATION BY BPV 1 IN VITRO Both antibodies prevented in vitro cell transformation by BPV 1 in an assay developed by Dvoretzky et al. 1980, Virol. 103 369 375 . This quantitative tissue culture assay is based upon the fact that BPV 1 orBPV 2 induce distinct foci of morphologically transformed cells in vitro in two mouse cell lines NId 3T3 andC127 . Dvoretzky et al. suggest that a single particle is required for focus inauction. The morphologically transformed cells contain BPV DNA sequences, grow in low serum and in soft agar and are tuorigenic in nuae mice.Preincubation of bovine papilloma extracts with rabbit anti BPV l serum neutralizes virus infectivity ana is reflected by a loss of transforming ability e.g., a decrease in the number of foci formed . Using the procedure described below, preincubation of bovine papilloma extracts with rabbit anti fusion protein serum anti pC2Vl or anti pFU41 prepared in Section 6.9.2 resulted in a reduction in the number of foci induced in C127 cells. The supernatant of a preparation of crude virus bovine papilloma extract containing approximately 3xlO5 focus forming units m, PFU m5 was frozen in methanol dry ice, thawed and sonicated three times for 15 seconds each in 50 mM Tris SCl pH 7.2 , lOU mM Nail. The resulting mixture was diluted lit100 and divided into 3 mQ aliquots. Each aliquot received one of the followings no sera control 60 undiluted pre immune serum 60 pt of undiluted anti fusion protein serum anti.pC2V1 serum or anti pFU4l serum 60 pQ of anti fusion protein serum diluted 1 10 60 pQ of anti fusion protein serum diluted 1 100. After mixing by vortexing for 10 seconds the papilloma extracts antiserum mixtures were incubated at 370C for 1 hour. C127 cells were grown at 370C in the following growth medium Dulbecco s modified Eagle Media supplemented with 108 fetal calf serum and with penicillin and streptomycin 100 pg mQ each . Each 60 mm petri dish had been seeded with approximately 105 cells on the previous day. The growth medium was removed and each plate received 1 mQ of one of the papilloma extract antiserum mixtures. The plates were incubated at 370C for 1 hour with 10 CO2 humidified air. During this time, the plates were tilted every 20 minutes. Then 10 mll of pre warmed growth medium was added to each plate. The medium was replenished on the following day and then three times a week for 16 days.The plates were examined for foci formation, fixed, stained and the foci were counted. Virus neutralization by anti pC2V1 or anti pFU41 was indicated by a reduction in the number of foci formed in cells treated with mixtures of papilloma extract and rabbit anti fusion protein serum see Table I .

VACCINATION OF CATTLE WITH CRO Ll 8 GALACTOSIDASE FUSION PROTEIN Cro Ll ss galactosidase fusion protein was purified from E. coli containing pC2Vl as described inSection 5.7. Whole cell preparations of L. coli containing pC2V1 were obtained from stationary cultures, heat treated at 650C for 30 minutes. Both purified fusion protein and whole cell preparation were further inactivated with BEI Section 6.1.9 . Three month old calves were vaccinated as indicated in Table II. Three animals were vaccinated intramuscularly for each experiment and each animal was given an initial injection and an equivalent boost thirty one days later.
