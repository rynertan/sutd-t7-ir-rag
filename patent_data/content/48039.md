## Description
Plant growth regulating compositions, a method for regulating the growth of plants using the compositions, novel heterocycle containing aniline compounds and a process for their preparation This invention relates to a composition for and to a method of regulating the growth of plants and to compounds for use in such a composition or method. In the past, the vast majority of agricultural chemical research work was directed towards the development of chemical fertilizers and the development of chemicals to combat pests, diseases and weeds which reduce the yield of crops. The belief was that by adequately feeding the plant and by optimizing its environment, the yields of the crop could be maximized. In recent years it has become clear that it is possible to affect the growth of plants in a much more fundamental way, that is by the application of chemicals which affect the biochemical processes occuring in the plant. Much research is now being directed towards the development of chemical plant growth regulants which are capable of altering the biochemistry of plants in such a way that useful effects are achieved. One important field of research is into the stimulation of crops to produce higher yields. It would for example be most useful to be able to increase the yield of soyabeans, a valuable source of protein, by means of a chemical treatment. It has now been found that certain heterocycle containing aniline compounds have useful plant growth regulating activity. Chemistry and Industry , 3rd February 1968, p.l55, discloses that certain N l heterocyclyl l cyanoethyl anilines may be prepared by reaction of a ketone with aniline and cyanide ion in the presence of acetic acid. There is no suggestion, however, that these compounds have any use in agriculture. The invention provides a plant growth regulating composition which comprises a carrier and, as active ingredient, a compound of the general formula I or, where possible, an acid addition salt thereof EMI2.1 in which Het represents an optionally substituted 5 membered heterocyclic ring containing one hetero atom Ar represents an optionally substituted phenyl group and either X and Y together represent a bond, or X represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group and Y represents a hydrogen atom or an acyl group derived from a carboxylic acid. The ring Het may be saturated or unsaturated and may for example be unsubstituted or substituted by one or more, preferably one or two, of the same or different substitutents selected from halogen atoms, alkyl groups, for example methyl groups, and nitro groups. When Het represents a pyrrolyl group, this may carry an N oxide substituent. Preferably the ring Het is unsubstituted, for example, it may be a 2 or 3 furyl, thienyl or pyrrolyl group or one of the corresponding tetrahydro groups. An especially preferred group Ret is a 2 thienyl group. The group Ar is preferably unsubstituted or substituted by one or more, especially one or two, of the same or different substituents selected from halogen atoms and alkyl, haloalkyl, alkoxy, haloalkoxy, nitro, cyano, alkanoyl, carboxy and alkoxycarbonyl groups. Especially preferred substituents are halogen atoms and methyl, methoxy and trifluoromethyl groups. Most preferably, the group Ar carries one or two substituents, and most preferably these substituents are halogen atoms. In the substituents mentioned above for the groups Het andAr, unless otherwise stated, any halogen atom present is preferably a fluorine, bromine or chlorine atom, and any alkyl moiety preferably has up to 4, especially 1 or 2, carbon atoms. If X represents an alkyl group, this preferably has up to 4 carbon atoms, for example X may represent a methyl group. If Y represents an acyl group derived from a carboxylic acid, this group is preferably an optionally substituted alkanoyl or benzoyl group. An alkanoyl group may for example be substituted by one or more of the same or different substituents selected from halogen atoms and alkoxy, phenyl, phenoxy, carboxy and alkoxycarbonyl groups, but preferably an alkanoyl group Y is unsubstituted. Preferably an alkanoyl group Y has up to 4 carbon atoms, for example Y may represent an acetyl group. If Y represents an optionally substituted benzoyl group, the preferred substituents are as given above for the group Ar. Preferably X and Y together represent a bond, or X and Y both represent hydrogen atoms. When Y represents hydrogen atom, the compounds of the general formula I can form acid addition salts, which may be present as active ingredient in the compositions according to the invention. Suitable acids include organic acids, for example tartaric or citric acid, and inorganic acids, for example hydrochloric acid. Most of the compounds of the general formula I are novel, and the invention therefore also provides these novel compounds per se. The novel compounds are those of the general formula I and acid addition salts thereof as defined above, provided that if Y represents a hydrogen atom and either X represents a methyl group or Het represents an unsubstituted 2 furyl ring and X represents a hydrogen atom, then Ar must represent a substituted phenyl group. The invention also provides a process for the preparation of a novel compound of the general formula I, which comprises reacting a compound of the general formulaEMI3.1 with a compound of the general formula Y.CN and in the event of a compound of the general formulaEMI4.1 being required, reacting a resulting compound of the general formulaEMI4.2 with an oxidizing agent and in the event of a compound of the general formulaEMI4.3 being produced and a compound of the general formulaEMI4.4 being required, reacting said compound of the formula Ic with a suitable acylating agent. Hydrogen cyanide may be added to the compound of the general formula II as such, in the form of a solution, a gas or a liquid, or it may be generated in situ, for example by the action of an acid on an alkali metal cyanide. The acid may be a mineral acid, such as hydrochloric acid, or an organic acid, such as acetic acid. Preferred acyl cyanides are optionally substituted alkanoyl or benzoyl cyanides, for example acetyl or benzoyl cyanide. The reaction of the compound of the general formula II with the compound of formula Y.CN may be carried out over a wide temperature range, for example within the range of from 0 to 1500C. It is conveniently carried out at the reflux temperature of the reaction. mixture, or at room temperature. The reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a suitable solvent, for example an ether, an alcohol., a hydrocarbon or a chlorinated hydrocarbon. The molar ratio of the reactants may vary over a wide range. An excess of the reactant Y.CN, for example up to a 5 fold exeess, may be used, but. preferably approximately stoichiometric quantities are used. To produce a compound of formula I in which X and Y together represent a bond, a compound of formula Ib is prepared, and then reacted with an oxidizing agent, for example manganese dioxide.Any suitable solvent, for example benzene, may be used if desired, and the reaction temperature is preferably in the range of from 0 to 100 C. Conveniently the reaction may be carried out at room temperature. Rather than using as reactant a compound of formula Y.CN when Y is an acyl group, it may be preferred to prepare a compound of formula Id by acylation of a resulting compound of formula Ic.Any suitable acylating agent, for example a carboxylic acid, an acyl halide or an acyl anhydride, may be used. Preferably, an acyl chloride is used, and the reaction is then preferably carried out in the presence of an acid binding agent, which may be an organic or inorganic base. Organic amines, for example triethylamine, are especially suitable. The reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of an inert solvent, for example a hydrocarbon such as benzene, at. a temperature in the range of from 50 to 1500C. The reaction is conveniently carried out under reflux. Compounds of the general formula II are Schiff bases and can be prepared by methods analogous to known methods, for example by reacting an aldehyde or ketone of formula Het.CO.X, with an aniline of formula ArNR2 The compounds of the general formula I have plant growth regulating properties and the invention provides a method of regulating the growth of a plant at a locus, which comprises applying to the locus a compound or a composition according to the invention. An especially useful plant growth regulating effect is the increase in the number of pods and or seed weight yield in soyabean plants, and the locus to be treated is therefore preferably a soyabean crop. The effect and efficacity of the treatment will in general depend on the growth stage of the crop treated.To promote increased numbers of pods in soyabean plants at time of harvest, the treatment is suitably carried out during the period from the time at which the flowers have differentiated up to the time that the pods have begun to fill. In this same respect the most significant increases in crop yield seem to occur when the soyabean crop is treated at about the midway stage of the filling of the pods. Preferably the growth of the plants is regulated by the application of the active compound at a dosage in the range of from 0.05 to 4 kg ha, preferably 0.25 to 1.5 kg ha. A carrier in a composition according to the invention is any material with which the active ingredient is formulated to facilitate application to the locus to be treated, which may for example be a plant, seed or soil, or to facilitate storage, transport or handling. A carrier may be a solid or a liquid, including a material which is normally gaseous but which has been compressed to form a liquid, and any of the carriers normally used in formulating agricultural compositions may be used. A composition according to the invention preferably contains from 0.5 to 95 by weight of active ingredient. Suitable solid carriers include natural and synthetic clays and silicates, for example natural silicas such as diatomaceous earths magnesium silicates, for example talcs magnesium aluminium silicates, for example attapulgites and vermiculites aluminium silicates, for example kaolinites, montmorillonites and micas calcium carbonate calcium sulphate synthetic hydrated silicon oxides and synthetic calcium or aluminium silicates elements, for example carbon and sulphur natural and synthetic resins, for example coumarone resins, polyvinyl chloride, and styrene polymers and copolymers solid polychlorophenols bitumen waxes, for example beeswax, paraffin wax, and chlorinated mineral waxes and solid fertilisers, for example superphosphates. Suitable liquid carriers include water alcohols, for example isopropanol and glycols ketones, for example acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone and cyclohexanone ethers aromatic or araliphatic hydrocarbons, for example benzene, toluene and xylene petroleum fractions, for example kerosine and light mineral oils chlorinated hydrocarbons, for example carbon tetrachloride, perchloroethylene and trichloroethane. Mixtures of different liquids are often suitable. Agricultural compositions are often formulated and transported in a concentrated form which is subsequently diluted by the user before application. The presence of small amounts of a carrier which is a surface active agent facilitates this process of dilution. A surface active agent may be an emulsifying agent, a dispersing agent or a wetting agent it may be nonionic or ionic.Examples of suitable surface active agents include the sodium or calcium salts of polyacrylic acids and lignin sulphonic acids the condensation products of fatty acids or aliphatic amines or amides containing at least 12 carbon atoms in the molecule with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide fatty acid esters of glycerol, sorbitan, sucrose or pentaerythritol condensates of these with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide condensation products of fatty alcohol or alkyl phenols, for example p octylphenol or E octylcresol, with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide sulphates or sulphonates of these condensation products alkali or alkaline earth metal salts, preferably sodium salts, of sulphuric or sulphonic acid esters containing at least 10 carbon atoms in the molecule, for example sodium lauryl sulphate, sodium secondary alkyl sulphates, sodium salts of sulphonated castor oil, and sodium alkylaryl sulphonates such as sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate and polymers of ethylene oxide and copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. The compositions of the invention may for example be formulated as wettable powders, dusts, granules, solutions, emulsifiable concentrates, emulsions, suspension concentrates and aerosols.Wettable powders usually contain 25, 50 and 75 w of active ingredient and usually contain, in addition to solid inert carrier, 3 10 w of a dispersing agent and, where necessary, 0 10 w of stabiliser s and or other additives such as penetrants or stickers. Dusts are usually formulated as a dust concentrate having a similar compositions to that of a wettable powder but without a dispersant, and are diluted in the field with further solid carrier to give a composition usually containing 10 w of active ingredient. Granules are usually prepared to have a size between 10 and 100 BS mesh 1.676 0.152 mm , and may be manufactured by agglomeration or impregnation techniques.Generally, granules will contain 25 w active ingredient and 0 10 w of additives such as stabilisers, slow release modifiers and binding agents. Fmulsifiable concentrates usually contain, in addition to a solvent and, when necessary, co solvent, 10 50 w v active ingredient, 2 20 w v emulsifiers and 0 20 w v of other additives such as stabilisers, penetrants and corrosion inhibitors.Suspension concentrates are usually compounded so as to obtain a stable, non sedimenting flowable product and usually contain 10 75 w active ingredient, 0.5 15 w of dispersing agents, 0.110 w of suspending agents such as protective colloids and thixotropic agents, 0 10 w of other additives such as defoamers, corrosion inhibitors, stabilisers, penetrants and stickers, and water or an organic liquid in which the active ingredient is substantially insoluble certain organic solids or inorganic salts may be present dissolved in the formulation to assist in preventing sedimentation or as anti freeze agents for water. Aqueous dispersions and emulsions, for example compositions obtained by diluting a wettable powder or a concentrate according to the invention with water, also lie within the scope of the present invention. The said emulsions may be of the water in oil or of the oil in water type, and may have a thick mayonnaise like consistency. The compositions of the invention may also contain other ingredients, for example, other compounds possessing plant growth regulating, insecticidal or fungicidal properties.
