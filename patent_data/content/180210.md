# SYNTHESIS OF NEOALKANOLS

## Abstract
Neoalkanols of the formula R₁R₂R₃CCH₂OH are synthe sized by hydrogenation of a neoacid of the formula R₁R₂R₃CCOOH wherein R₁, R₂ and R₃ are the same or dif ferent alkyl of 1 10 carbon atoms, at a temperature of 175 350 C and a hydrogen pressure of 10 100 Kg cm² over a copper oxide zinc oxide hydrogenation catalyst.
