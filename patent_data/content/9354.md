# Waveform shaping circuit.

## Abstract
A waveform shaping circuit which has large hysteresis loop characteristics and which is operated as a Schmitt trigger circuit comprises several impedance elements 14a, ... 14n and several reference voltage source units 15a, ... 15n . By appropriately selecting the number n of the MOS transistors 15a, ... 15n the hysteresis loop voltage n V
