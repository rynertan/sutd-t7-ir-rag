# Method for the production of a photographic black and white image.

## Abstract
Method of treating a dye image in photographic material which dye image has been formed by the colour coupling reaction of a primary aromatic amine colour developing agent with a phenolic colour coupler of the formula With this method the spectral absorption range of dye images formed by the above phenolic or naphtholic coupler compounds can be increased or altered. Further the resist ance of these dye images to fading by actinic light can be increased over a long period.
