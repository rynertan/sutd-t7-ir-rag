## Description
Anti Oxidation CompositionSummary of the InventionThis invention relates to anti oxidation composition consisting of the over ground parts of carrot Daucus carota L. is usefull applied for the various usage and has a good effect in each usages.The usages of this anti oxidation composition are anti oxidation agents, human cell activation agents , foods for care and growing hair , tonics for care and growing hair , composition of curing liver spots , healty foods for eyes , foods for curing cataract , ingredient of tobacco composition , and so on.Objects of the InventionThe object of this invention is to propose a very safety anti oxidation composition made of an usual eatable vegitable , i.e. ground parts of carrot Daucus carota L. .More object of this invention is to propose an anti oxidation composition having a wide application , i.e. anti oxidation agents , human cell activation agents , foods for care and growing hair tonics for care and growing hair , composition of curing liver spots , healty foods for eyes , foods for cataract , ingredient of tobacco composition and so on.,.Prior arts and defects of Prior arts At present , synthtic or natural anti oxidation agents are invariably added in foods or toilet goods in order to keep it a good characteristics.Synthtic Chemicals, cr tochopherol, B.H.A and B.H.T, as use as usual these anti oxidation ingredients are said to give a bad effect for human body.With this problem in synthetic agents,vitamin E, as natural substance, comes into popular use as anti oxidation agents for foods additives or the like at present.Whereas Vitamin E has a superior anti oxidation property, Continuous eating a large quantity of vitamin E takes human beings disadvantages on the ground of its oil solubilty and accumulation in the body.Generally, a carrot Daucus carota L. belonging the Umbelliferae family is one or two years plants and native products area is said to be in the Middle East.This carrot calutivated in china from the remotest days have been eating in Japan also for long time.It goes with saying that contiuous eating carrot brings healty effects for human body. The cooking of the ground parts, especialy leaf, of carrot is very difficult that boiling, frying, frizziling and other cooking method are not able to alternate its tasts.Futhermore, chewings of the ground parts of carrot is very hard.Therefore, young people, especialy school boys and girls, tend to dislike not only the root but also the leaf of carrot by the above reason. Fresh juice and fresh vegitable salad making of the raw material of carrot have a defect that is difficult to eat a lot of amounts.Because, these foods have nonwell smells based on the leaf of carrot.There is other problem on carrot leaf that is not able to clean perfectly for its complexed shape.In this specification, the word green yellow vegitable means a vegitable having a carotin more than 60 micrgrams per 100 grams in raw materials.The amounts of carotin is followings in each green yellow vegitable carrot 7300 microgram, spinach 3100, pumpkin 790, Spanish paprika 270.A carrot have more carotin than other green yellow vegitable.At the same time, the leaf of the carrot includs a big amount of carotin as same as the root of it, still more the calcium amounts is 5 times than the roots amounts.Then, the leaf of the carrot is usually costed away in the farm, because of its easy becoming dirty in calutivation circumstance.In recent days, circumstance of foods being aculatly and sharply changing on the basis of alternation of food materials and cooking methods brings senility and adult diseases to young or middle age people.Main reason of this phenomenen is relation to lipids amounts and peroxide lipids amounts in body, and these amounts are relation to increasing of these peoples high gluose contain foods. Keeping a good health condition is to be based on the depression of the peroxide lipids amounts in the body, especialy serum.Thus, the peroxide lipids in serum are causing substance for stopping the blood fluid and destroying the cell wall.By the way, the population of women having liver spots on skin is progressively increasing and the age of these women is lower and lower than former.The reasons of the above phenomenen are to be said followings 1. overeatings of frozen foods including animal lipids and protides, 2. lessereatings of vegitable foods, 3. smokings, 4. keeping late hours, and so on.The most parts of liver spots origin is unknown, but clearly increasing of peroxide lipids amounts in serum and surface skin epidelmis. lipids appears with liver spots.Citing the Report paper to Association of Japanese Skin Science on 1971 of Dr.Hayakawa of Nagoya University, peroxide lipids is increasing at the time of appearing the skin diseases, i.e. melanoderma and liver spots on face, like as next table A and B.

Usually, the root parts of this plants, carrot Daucus carota L. , is eaten.But, only the ground parts of a carrot is used in this invention.When the ground parts of a carrot is preparedas the component of this inventional anti oxidation composition, it is necessary to obtain dry powder or extracts powder through drying or extracts methods describing hereinafter.In this invention, the extract methods are not restriction within following examples.At first, the leaf parts of a carrot is to be dried with frozen dried methods or natural drying methods.The crushings of this dried leaf of a carrot is also used a component of this invention.The drying process including heating more than 100e is not preferably use in this invention.The dried carrot leaf is extracted with aqueous solvent, if necessary, under reflux. Futhermore, it is permitted to heat in the above extract process, if it is needed.The word aqueous solvents in this specification means that solvents contains water more than 95 weight x Preferable examples of aqueous solvents are water, physiological saltwater, alcohol solution, organic acid solution and salt of organic acid solution.In this extracts process of this invention, both dried and wetted carrot leaf are able to be employment.In the case utilizing wetted carrot, it is necessary to cut the leaf in pieces for pre treatment.After this,5 times amounts of water is added on the pre treatment leaf.During 2 hours or more, this extraction is proceeded under heating less than 1000C. After this extraction, the extract solution and solids are filtrated.Filtrated extracts solution is left in silent condition during 24 hours or more under cooling 5 C This left extract solution is filtrated again and the filtrated extract solution is condensed to 1 3 times.This condensed extracts is used intact for the necessary component of this inventional anti oxidation composition.Furthermore, drying powder of this condensed extract solution is permitted to use a component of this anti oxidation composition by means of usual drying method, such as frozen drying.In the above mentioned example, the other codensed extracts solution or condensed extracts drying powder is obtained to substitute physiological saltwater for water, if necessary.Organic acid dilute solution, alcohol dilute solution or salt of organic acid dilute solution is able to substitute for water as same operation as the above physiological salt water for obtaining extract powder or condensed extract.Organic acid including its salts is selected from all organic acids permitted by foods Acts, i.e. acetic acid, citric acid, malic acid or the else.The concentration of organic acid dilute solution is from 0.1 to 1 weight , preferably 0.5 weight .Tea, i.e. foods style, as the embodiment of this invention s anti oxidation composition is one of the suitable examples.It is employed the usual process for making tea from the ground parts or carrot like as Japanese green tea.One embodiment of making process of the ground parts of carrot Daucus carota L. is following approximate procedures 1 . harvesting the ground parts of carrot, 2 . cutting the ground parts of carrot in pieces, 3 . heating with steam during 10 seconds or more about 98 C, 4 . rough crumpling during more than 40 minutes under heating at 70 to 75 c, 5 . fine crumpling during more than 30 minutes under heating at 50 to 55 c, 6 . at last, drying during 20 to 30 minutes under heating at 60 to 70 C.Purification of the above extracts with aqueous solvents is able io be acceptance in this invention.The approximate procedures of purification of the dried extracts powder are followings 1 . dissolving the dried extract powder in water, 2 . filtration this solution, 3 . Funnel separating the filtrate solution with n hexan water solvents, 4 . Taking out the water soluble division, 5 . drying this division by water evaporation under diminished pressure, 6 . dissolving the dried division solution into water again, 7 . Funnel separating the solution with n butanol water, 8 . Taking out the water soluble division, 9 . drying this division by evaporating the water under diminished pressure, lO .dissolving the dried division in methanol, 11 .Separating the solution with column chromatography means, 12 .Finally getting a white powder.Regretfully the chemical structure of this purified white powder is unknown up to this date.This is a important subJect for inventers in near feature.The healty foods for eyes is the other preferably embodiment of this invention s anti oxidation composition.For deriving more effects from this healty foods for eyes, it is important to mix drying powder or extracts of onion Allium cepa and or citrus fruits except its juice with the ground parts of carrot as the necessary component.The word onion means eatable plants belonging the liliacease family and this plant s scholar name is Allium cepa.In this invention, many variety cultivational species of onion is able to be use, for example, Kaizuka wase, Aichi ki wase, Imai ki wase,Awagi Kodaka, Sapporo Ki, Yamaguchimaru, Rikai and so on.Dry powder, especialy frozen dry powder, of onion employs prefrable component of this invention.The reason of frozen dry powder being preferable than others is to make onion to powder without deviation of onion smell substance, i.e.propyl allyl disulfide, allyl sulfide.The inventors thought that this onion smell substance assisted the activity of Vitamin B1 being a coenzyme of glucose metabolism in the body.And the more, this onion smell substance has the function of preventing the fatigue stuff such as lactic acid gathering around the Neuron.The function of the ground parts of carrot being depression the products of peroxide is more greater by the onion powder.The peroxide lipids gathering and producting around the eyes especially capillary of eyes is effectively reduced by the above the ground parts of carrot and others component, wherefore the healty effects for eyes is obtained by this anti oxidation composition.The mixing ratio between the ground parts of carrot and others is 100, the former, vs. from 50 to 120, the latter, by weight.In this invention, foods for curing cataract and ingredient of tobacco are other suitable embodiments of this anti oxidation composition.It is preferable to mix the dry powder and or extracts of ginseng Panax schinseng Ness with the ground parts of carrot component for the above embodiments.The word ginseng means a plant belonging the Araliaeeae family and this plant scholar name is Panax schinseng Nees.Ginseng is said to be said giving a superior effect for healty and the native land of this ginseng is North East area of china, korean peninsula and so on. All parts of this, ginseng including roots and leaf, preferably roots,are permitted to use the material of this invention.Dried powder, preferably frozen dried powder, and or extracts by the same procedure as the ground parts of carrot is preferably used in this invention.In the case of making this tobacco composition,these components are added in any one process of usual tobacco making procedures that consists of tobacco leaf mixing, processing and molding.The mixing step is selected by the relation between components state, powder or extract solution, and tobacco making process.The mixing proportion of these components is less than 50 weight and more than 2 weight in all tobacco composition.In the case less than 2 weight mixing, than effect of this invention is not appeared, on the contrary, in the case more than 50 weight mixing, the taste and the smell as the tobacco is inferior than no mixing tobacco.The mixing ratio between the ground part of carrot and ginseng is the former 100 vs. the latter from 50 to 120 by weight.Now, we describe Examples, Tests and comparisons hereinafter, for effects of this invention being clear.Example 1 2 kg of leaf parts of ordinaly carrot is dried. This dried leaf is extracted with 10 2 of water during 60 minutes under heating at 80 R .
