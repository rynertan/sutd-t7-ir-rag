# Strengthened glass ceramic article method of manufacture.

## Abstract
A glass ceramic having a lithium aluminosilicate crystal phase with a very low coefficient of thermal expansion and a residual glassy phase of substantial amount and higher coeffi cient of expansion, which can be a borosilicate or boroalumino silicate glass. The two phases form a dilatant system wherein the termal expansion curve changes markedly in character at a transition point in the range of 500 750 C., the crystal phase dominating below that temperature and the glass phase con trolling at high temperatures.
