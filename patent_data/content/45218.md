# Apparatus for removing solvents from air.

## Abstract
Apparatus for removing solvents from air includes an air duct 2 through which solvent laden air is arranged to flow. A plurality of coalescer pads 4 each having an extended surface area extend across the duct 2 . A plurality of spray nozzles 6 for spraying an absorption liquid such as oil are arranged upstream of each pad 4 and are arranged to have a spray pattern which impinges over sub stantially all of the upstream external surface of the respec tive pad 4 . The apparatus, which is particularly useful for remov ing solvents from the air discharged from a paint spray booth, enables efficient solvent removal and yet has a low power requirement.
