# VEHICLE CONTROL SYSTEM

## Abstract
A railway vehicle control system particularly, but not ex clusively, suitable for controlling single track working. Trans ponders 5, 6 are located at fixed positions aiong the track such as an intersection, points and so on, and a vehicle 1 is provided with sensors 7, 8 for detecting the transponders 5, 6 . A central control office 15 supplies information concern ing an identifying characteristic of the next transponder 5 ex pected to be detected, when this happens the event triggers apparatus on the vehicle 1 to communicate with the central office 15 which then supplies information to identity the next transponder 6 . The same sequence of events ensues as each successive transponder is passed. The transponders may be staggered alternately to opposite sides of the track for identifi cation purposes. If the expected transponder is not detected, but instead a different transponder is encountered, then a ve hicle safety function such as the emergency brakes, may be brought into operation.
