## Description
This invention relates to methods of manufacturing semiconductor devices having an oxygen containing polycrystalline silicon layer. Figure 3 of the accompanying drawings shows a circuit diagram of a resistor load type static random access memory SRAM in the form of a semiconductor device having a semiconductor substrate with a resistor electrically connected to the substrate, and including field effect transistors FETs 12 and resistors 13. Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings shows a sectional view of a first previously proposed example of the SRAM 11. In this example, an The stand by current of the SRAM 11 is determined by the resistance of the resistor 13. In the above example, the polycrystalline Si layer 18 serving as the resistor 13 has a relatively low resistivity of 5 x 10⁵ ohm.cm. Therefore, the stand by current of the SRAM 11 is relatively high, and power consumption is high. These problems become particularly noticeable when a number of SRAMs 11 are integrated. Figure 2 of the accompanying drawings shows a second previously proposed example of the SRAM 11, forming an improvement over the first example. The SRAM 11 of this example is substantially the same as that of the first example except that a polycrystalline Si layer 19 containing oxygen is used in place of the pure polycrystalline Si layer 18. As disclosed in issued Japanese Patent No. 55 13426, polycrystalline Si containing oxygen has a very high resistivity about 2 x 10⁶ ohm.cm at an oxygen content of 2 , and about 10¹⁰ ohm.cm at an oxygen content of 20 . A semiconductor device having a layer of polycrystalline Si containing oxygen formed on a semiconductor substrate is also described in issued Japanese Patent No. 53 2552. The polycrystalline Si layer 19 containing oxygen is formed by a low pressure chemical vapour deposition CVD method using, for example, When P or As is doped in a connecting portion between the diffusion region 17 and the polycrystalline Si layer 19 in order to reduce the connection resistance of this connecting portion, the As can thus be seen, it is difficult to obtain a sufficiently high resistance with the pure polycrystalline Si layer 18, while it is also difficult ohmically to connect the polycrystalline Si layer 19 containing oxygen to the diffusion region 17. US patent specifications US A 4 001 762 and US A 4 406 051 disclose further examples of semiconductor devices in which resistive elements formed of polycrystalline silicon containing oxygen are provided. According to the present invention there is provided a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device, comprising the steps of In methods embodying the present invention, an oxide formed between the first and second polycrystalline silicon layers upon formation of the second polycrystalline silicon layer containing oxygen is dispersed over the first and second polycrystalline silicon layers, thereby ohmically connecting the electrically connecting portion of the semiconductor substrate and the second polycrystalline silicon layer. In addition, a high resistance can be obtained in the second polycrystalline silicon layer. The invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, throughout which like parts are referred to by like references, and in which Figures 1 and 2 are sectional views of respective previously proposed examples of SRAMs Figure 3 is a circuit diagram showing an SRAM to which the present invention can be applied Figure 4 is a sectional view showing steps in a first method embodying the present invention and Figure 5 is a sectional view showing a step in a second method embodying the present invention and corresponding to the step shown in Figure 4E. In the first method embodying the invention, as shown in Figure 4A, an Subsequently, as shown in Figure 4B, a polycrystalline Si layer 18 having a thickness of 5 to 20 nm is formed by a low pressure CVD method on the diffusion region 17 and the As shown in Figure 4C, a polycrystalline Si layer 19 containing 2 to 10 atomic of oxygen and having a thickness of 150 to 400 nm is then formed by a low pressure CVD method on the polycrystalline Si layer 18. In this process, as in the case of the example of Figure 2, the polycrystalline Si layer 18 is oxidized, and an As shown in Figure 4D, in order to reduce the connecting resistance between the diffusion region 17 and the polycrystalline Si layer 18, P or As ions 21 are ion implanted in the connecting portion at a dose of 1 x 10¹⁶cm ² and an acceleration energy of 70 keV. The Si substrate 14 on which the polycrystalline Si layers 18 and 19 are formed is annealed in an N₂ atmosphere at 900 to 1,000 C for 20 to 60 minutes. Then, as shown in Figure 4E, the Si crystal grains of the polycrystalline Si layers 18 and 19, which had sizes of 2 to 5 nm, grow into Si crystal grains 22 having sizes of about 20 nm. The As a result, as shown in Figure 4E, the When the SRAM 11 is manufactured by this method, a resistor 13 having a resistance several times to several hundred times that of the example of Figure 1, using only the polycrystalline Si layer 18, can be formed. The stand by current can be reduced to from 1 n to 1 100n where n is a positive integer smaller than 10 . Furthermore, the Growth of crystal grains as described above is also described in M. Hamasaki et al, Crystal graphic study of Semi insulating polycrystallize silicon SIPOS doped with oxygen atoms , J.A.P. 49 7 , July 1978, pp 3987 to 3992, and T. Adachi et al, AES and PES studies of Semi insulating polycrystallize silicon SIPOS films , J.E. CS Vol. 127, No. 7, July 1980, pp 1617 to 1621. Figure 5 shows the second method embodying the invention and corresponds to Figure 4E of the first method. The second method has substantially the same steps as those of the first method except that the polycrystalline Si layer 18 is formed not on the entire surfaces of the diffusion region 17 and the In the SRAM 11, the polycrystalline Si layer 19 is used as a resistor in a direction along the surface of the Si substrate 14. However, when the polycrystalline Si layer 18 is formed on the entire surface of the Si substrate 14 as shown in Figure 4E, a current also flows in the polycrystalline Si layer 18. Since the polycrystalline Si layer 18 has a lower resistivity than that of the polycrystalline Si layer 19, the polycrystalline Si layer 18 must be made extremely thin as compared with the polycrystalline Si layer 19 in order to obtain a high overall resistance. However, it is not easy to form a very thin polycrystalline Si layer 18, and product reliability also suffers when such a thin layer is used. As in this method, however, if the polycrystalline Si layer 18 is formed only near the diffusion region 17 to be in ohmic contact with the polycrystalline Si layer 19, a resistor portion 24 in the polycrystalline Si layer 19 serving as a resistor 13 of the SRAM 11 has a high resistance. Therefore, since the polycrystalline Si layer 18 can be formed to have a thickness of 100 to 200 nm larger than in the first method, the polycrystalline Si layer 18 can be formed easily and product reliability is improved. In the first and second methods, the present invention is applied to the manufacture of SRAMs. However, the invention can also be applied to the manufacture of devices other than SRAMs.
