# Internal combustion engine associated with a transmission.

## Abstract
An internal combustion engine 10 comprises a cylinder block 12 rigidly connected to a transmission 36 and having cylinder bores and bearing sections 22 and a bearing beam structure 26 including main bearing cap sections 28 each associating with each cylinder block bearing section 22 to rotatably support a crankshaft, first and second beam sections 32A, 32B securely connecting the main bearing cap sections 28 with each other and extending parallelly with the crankshaft axis, the first and second beam sections 32A, 32B being located spaced from each other and along the respective opposite side portions of each bearing cap section 28 , and first and second connect ing sections 40A, 40B respectively integral with the first and second beam sections 32A, 32B and being rigidly con nected to the transmission 36 , thereby preventing the bearing beam structure 26 from its axial vibration while contributing to an improvement in rigidity of a power unit entire including the transmission.
