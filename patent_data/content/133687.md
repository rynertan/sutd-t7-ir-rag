# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR EXPANDING HEAT EXCHANGER TUBES

## Abstract
A heat exchanger tube is expanded externally, for instance for connecting it with a plate perimetrically of a hole in the plate through which it passes, by forcing through the bore of the tube a series of at least two expanders of progressively larger size. These expanders are secured on a tool steel rod so far apart from one another than before a trailing expander engages in the bore of the tube, the expander which led it has already emerged from the far end of the tube.
