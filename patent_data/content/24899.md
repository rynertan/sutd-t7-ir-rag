# Pyrophosphato titanate adducts and methods for treating particulate fillers using such adducts.

## Abstract
Adducts of tetrasubstituted pyrophosphato titanates and or amines, have the formula X The adducts are useful for improving the physical and chemical properties of many filled resins. There is also described a method of catalyzing a chemical reaction that is susceptible to catalysis by a Lewis Acid catal yst, a method of improving the dispersability of an inorganic solid and a method of improving the conductivity of a metal filled polymer, all these methods involving the use of the above adducts.
