# An aqueous solution of a tissue plasminogen activator dissolved therein at an increased concentration and a method.

## Abstract
An aqueous solution of a tissue plasminogen activator dissolved therein at an increased concentration which com prises an aqueous medium and, dissolved therein, a high purity tissue plasminogen activator and at least one dissolu tion aid selected from the group consisting of lysine, ornithine and salts thereof, and a method for increasing a solubility of a high purity tissue plasminogen activator in an aqueous medium comprising adding said at least one dissolution aid to an aqueous solution of a high purity tissue plasminogen activator. The present aqueous solution contains a high purity tissue plasminogen activator dissolved therein at an increased concentration and the activity of the tissue plas minogen activator can be maintained during handling and storage of the aqueous solution. Therefore, not only can be easily and efficiently performed the treatment of a tissue plasminogen activator in each purification step but also can be stored safely, stably an aqueous tissue plasminogen activator solution as a final product.
