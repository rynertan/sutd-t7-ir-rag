# Array antenna system.

## Abstract
A multibeam array antenna system 3 has a matrix configuration defined by first power feedlines 21, 22 and second power feedlines 4a to 4h connected to respective radiation elements 5a to 5h , with directional couplers 31a to 31h, 32a to 32h at the intersections of the matrix. First phase adjusting delay lines 7a to 7h are connected between output terminals 8a to 8h of the second feedlines and the radiation elements 5a to 5h to establish an aperture phase distribution which deviates symmetrically with respect to the central portion of the aperture as compared to the distribu tion obtaining for in phase excitation, thus enabling signifi cant suppression of spurious lobes appearing due to the configuration of the matrix feed network, while keeping a high crossover level between adjacent beams. Preferably, the antenna system further comprises second phase adjust ing delay lines which make it possible to reduce frequency variations in the direction of a radiating beam.
