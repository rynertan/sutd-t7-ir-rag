# Curable organopolysiloxane compositions.

## Abstract
An organopolysiloxane composition which has im proved adhesion and is curable at an elevated temperature in the presence of atmospheric moisture comprising a An organopolysiloxane having an average of at least two hydroxyl groups per molecule b an organosilicon compound containing at least two hydrolyzable groups per molecule which is capable of reacting with the hydroxyl groups of the organopolysilo xane c an organohydrogenpolysiloxane containing at least one silicon bonded hydrogen atom per molecule d a platinum catalyst and e if desired, a condensation catalyst. The resultant composition is generally heated to an elevated temperature to form an elastomer.
