# Method and apparatus for handling and utilizing system off gas in a pyro processing system.

## Abstract
The method utilizes a grate presenting first and second drying zones and a preheat zone a kiln and a cooler. The wet agglomerate cement raw material enters at the drying zone and flows counter to the general flow of process gases which enter at the cooler and exit from the first and second drying zones. More specifically, novelty resides in dividing the off gases from the preheat zone into first and second portions, the first portion of gas is heated by burning combustibles therein 55 and then passed back into the preheat zone. The second portion is heated by burning combustibles therein 61 . The second portion of gases, now heated, is combined with off gas from the kiln 18 in a quenching zone 62 . The combined quenched gas is then passed to the drying zones to be used therein. A further important aspect of the method is to introduce sorbents by means of three systems, 1 29, 32, 31, 33, 26 , 2 43, 42, 41 and 3 29, 111, 114 to scrub and remove sulfur pollutants. The basic grate, kiln and cooler apparatus is old. Novelty resides in the combination of the booster heater 55 , the combustion chamber 61 , the dust separator 52 , the quenching zone 62 , the first system 76, 77, 78, 81 to convey gas from the quench zone to the drying zone 16 , and the second system 83, 98, 86 connection to direct off gas from the drying zone 16 to the final dust collector 87 . A further novel aspect of the apparatus are the three sorbent material feed systems comprising 29, 32, 31, 33 , 43, 42, 41 and 29, 111, 112 .
