# Vaccines for protecting cattle and sheep against bovine leukemia virus.

## Abstract
Vaccines for protecting cattle against bovine leukemia virus BLV are prepared by in vitro culturing of lymphoid cell lines derived from bovine or ovine lymphosarcoma tissue. The cell lines are characterized by being non producers of BLV. The vaccines and their method of preparation can also be used for protecting sheep against bovine leukemia virus.
