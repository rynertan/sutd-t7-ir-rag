# CRINKLED, QUILTED ABSORBENT PAD

## Abstract
The invention is generally accomplished by providing a pad that has an impermeable backing member, an over laying permeable member and an absorbent coform layer therebetween. The pad is provided with a quilted pattern by permanent adhering compression of the pad in narrow areas, forming a lined pattern. The pad further may be heated to shrink the coform and provide a pleasing puckered surface.
