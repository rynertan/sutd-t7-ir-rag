# PREPARATION OF DISPERSIBLE CERIUM COMPOUNDS

## Abstract
The invention provides a process for the preparation of a dispersibie cerium compound i.e. a cerium compound which may be dispersed in a liquid to give a colloidal dispersion i.e, a sol . The process involves replacing a first species of ions associated with the cerium compound by a second species of ions e.g. hydroxyl ions and subsequently replacing the second species of ions of the cerium compound with a third species of ions e.g. counter ions . The replacing of the ions may be effected, for example, by ion exchange. Cerium IV oxide hydrate is an example of a cerium compound which can be made dispersible in accordance with the invention.
