## Description
FREE WHEEL FOR BICYCLES This invention concerns improvements to free wheels, and in particular, to free wheels for bicycles. To be more precise, the invention concerns an improved arrangement of the pawls of the free wheels for bicycles and of the respective pressure springs, through the use of which, on one hand the assembly of the free wheel in manufacturing phase is greatly simplified, and on the other, the slippages between said springs are reduced considerably, and almost completely removed, so that a high safety level and long life of the device are obtained, eliminating major causes of breakage and inefficiency of said free wheels. Experts in the sector are aware that the structure of the free wheels for bicycles adopted by preference today is that of an inner body, integral in rotation lith the heel, rotated by an outer body, carrying the sprockets driven by the bicycle chain, by means of at least one oscillating pawl integral ith the inner body and elastically urged to engage a serration obtained in the outer body. They are also aware that to date the elastic engagement of the pawls in said serration has been obtained by means of zaire or blade springs, positioned opposite pawls, i.e. pivoted in a fixed point of the periphery of the inner body, located, with respect to the free end of the pawl or to the point of contact between spring and pawl, on the opposite side of the pivoting axis of said pawl. This known arrangement is shown in figure 1, which is a crosssection of a free wheel for bicycles, comprising an inner body 1, and outer body 2 and a couple of pawls 3 oscillating, through their pin shaped ends 4, on the inner body 1, to engage 4th their free ends the serrated seats 5 of a serration obtained in the outer body 2. In the free wheel in figure 1, the pawls 3 are elastically urged to engage the seats 5 of ire pressure springs 6, one end of which are sound on pins 7 of the inner body 1 and the opposite end resting on the inner surface of the pawls 3. As may be seen, the pawls 3 and springs 6 are in opposite position, the centres of rotation of the pawls and springs being positioned on opposite sides in respect to their point of contact. It is evident, in this arrangement, that when the inner body 1 rotates in cloclafise direction, while the outer body 2 remains stationary situation corresponding to free heel rolling , the pawl 3 oscillates around its pin 4 in opposite direction e.g. in anticlocE ise direction then it is thrust towards the centre to that of the ire spring 6 i.e. in clocloise direction in the same conditions . This position is determined by the need to insert spring 6 in the restricted anular space available between bodies 1 and 2, with a sufficiently lond arm to give to the pawl even iiith fairly side oscillations at its end a sufficient pressure thrust. Although widely adopted in free wheels for bicycles, this arrangement has some drawbacks A On one hand, in production for assembly, it is in fact foreseen to insert first the two panels in their pivoting seats then the springs on the respective through pins, so that the operator pushes the point of a first pawl under the respective pawl, holds it in closing position to avoid spring release, normally with the aid of special pliers, then again pushes the point of the second pawl under the other pawl and moves the pliers to keep also this second pawl closed. Finally still keeping the pliers closed, he inters body 1 in body 2, talking care not to release the pliers until the palls are safely engaged in the serration 5 of the outer body. Tliis is obviously not an easy operation and often one or both springs suddenly jump from their seats, and it is necessary to repeat the operation. B On the other Island, in use the position isy in fact such that, during the oscillation movement of the pawl, a fair degree of slippage is produced between the point of the pressure spring and the lower face of the pawl. Furthermore, this movement is in the direction of reciprocal wedging of the two points in the very phase in which the pawl is lowered, i.e. hen it must overcome the force of the spring. This may easily cause some crawling lith loss of mechanism efficiency and problems for the bicycle user in competitions, these problems may seriously jeopardise the race results and also, through time, as the point of the spring produced by said relevant slippage becomes orn, may cause breakage or curling up of the spring, capable of putting a free wheel and the bicycle comple tely out of use and, in competitions, having even a champion disqualified . In an endeavour to overcome these problems, it has already been proposed, but with practical results of little importance for both the abovementioned problems, to form a short groove in the lower face of the free end of the pawl. In this Ã§ay the point of the zaire spring is guided and its side gripped, both in the assembly phase and during use of the free wheel. For the same purpose it was also proposed to use a blade spring rather a ire spring which is more stable in its seat. These proposals, both adopted in practice today, have however definitely not completely overcome the abovementioned problems. The purpose of this invention is, in fact to elininate these problems and in particular on one hand to permit an easier and rapid assembly, ithout the aid of special tools on the other hand, to permit a springing of the pals z itll minimum relevant movement between their lower face and the points of the springs, and therefore dth negligible frictions, and no risk of craling or breakage. This result is obtained due to the fact that the pawls and their pressure springs are assembled zith equal orientation the centres of rotation of a pawl and of the relevant spring being positioned at a minimum reciprocal distance and in the same side of the points of contact between the free ends of the same pawl and spring. According to a further feature of the invention, on the lower face of each pawl there is a groove for the lateral guide of the ire spring, this groove extending and intersecting also the pivoting ends of the same paWl. Further characteristics and advantages of this invention 5 be understood from the following description of a preferred embodiment thereof and on hand of the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 is, as already described, a cross section at the axis of a free Rtheel according to the knolm art, and Fig. 2 is a similar cross section of a free wheel according to this invention Figs. 3 and 4 show in longitudinal section and front view the detail of the pawl. As shown in Fig. 2, in a free wheel similar to those of the preceding art as to its general configuration, the pawls 3 and springs 6 are arranged in the same direction, that is, so that the centres of rotation of the pawls and springs are on the same side ith respect to their point of contact. More precisely, the centre of rotation of the springs 6 near the axis of the pins 7 , is very near the centre of oscillation of the pawls 3, coinciding tfith the pin end axis 4 of the said pawls 3, pivoted on a suitable recess of the inner body 1. As evidenced by the drawing without requiring further explanations, this arrangement reduces almost completely the sliding of the ends of the springs 6 on the inner face of the pawls 3 engaged thereby. In addition, with the centres of rotation being on the same side ith respect to the point of contact between the tip of the spring and the end of the pawl, the mutual wedging in movement in the downward moving phase of the pawl is altogether eliminiated. This consents a considerable reduction in the friction and almost completely eliminates the t ear produced by the sliding friction, while preventing still further the crawlings and breakages resulting therefrom thus ensuring the free wheel a smooth running and a working life decidedly higher than those of the conventional free wheels. In addition, the absence of the sliding friction and any resulting friction makes the movement of the pawls much smoother and allows the use of springs that are less stressed and sized only for balancing the weight of the pawl and the inertia of the latter when moving, the springs not being required as in the conventional kind of free whecl to overcome the wedging in, as expected in the known art, of the springs and pawls. Thus, not only the wear of the springs and pawls, but also that of the saw tooth surfaces of the outer body 2, limiting the seats 5, is considerably reduced with the therefrom ensuing advantages. Finally, the arrangement according to this invention, favours the assembly in the construction phrase in fact, the operator inserts first the spring on the respective pin, then while keeping it momentarily ssell gripped with the left hand fixes the pax l, making sure to house the spring in the through hole 3 . After the assembly of the pawl, the latter securely detains also the respective spring in its seat, so that the operator is free to proceed with the assembly of the second pawl without the risk of the spring of the first pawl jumping out of its seat. After the assembly of the second pawl, all he has to do is to grip the inner body 1 and insert it into the body 2 with a slight pressure and short rotation, without any particular difficulty and without the use of special tools. Obviously tlle invention is not limited to the particular embodiment described and shown in Fig. 2. For example the centres of rotation of the pawls and the relevant springs could be coincident.
