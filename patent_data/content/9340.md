# Heat sealable antistatic polypropylene film and method for its production.

## Abstract
An oriented heat sealable antistatic polypropylene film is manufactured by applying to one or both surfaces of a base polypropylene film, preferably by co extrusion, a layer of a heat sealable olefinic polymer for example, a predominantly linear random copolymer of ethylene with butene 1 containing between 0.2 and 10 by weight of an anionic hydrocarbyl preferably long chain alkyl sul phonate. A slip agent, for example oleamide, may also be incorporated in the base polypropylene film. The antistatic film has improved heat sealing properties which permits it to be run successfully on packaging machinery at high speeds.
