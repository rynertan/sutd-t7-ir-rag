# Purification of acrylonitrile.

## Abstract
A process for separating acrylonitrile from a solution containing acrylonitrile, water and impurities. Conventionally such a solution is fed to a drying column and then to a product column. The need for a drying column, by feeding the solution direct to a product column is eliminated. In an embodiment an overhead stream from a recovery column 118 is fed to an HCN column 126 for removal of HCN. The solution is then fed to the top a product column 150 which contains between 30 and 60 trays, a sidestream of purified acrylonitrile being removed through a line 159 located in the lower part of the column.
