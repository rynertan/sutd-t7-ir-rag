# Boiler for a central heating system.

## Abstract
The boiler according to the invention has a much nar rower width than known boilers which is obtained by placing the combustion cell 2 and the convection system 1 in two different jackets. Recirculation of the combustion gas is achieved by placing the burner in the upper half of the com bustion cell 2 . The possibility of splitting the boiler into two parts along the middle line allows the transport of the boiler through very small building openings.

## Claims
Claim Boiler having a combustion cell and a heat convection system and at least one jacket surrounding the combustion cell and the heat convection system characterized in that at least two jackets 4 , 5 separable from each other are provided, one for the combustion cell 2 and the other for the heat convection system, and in that the burner 3 is located in the upper half of the jacket 5 for the combustion cell 2 for recirculating and passing the combustion gases through the initial point of the flame.

## Description
Boiler for a central heating systemThis invention relates to a boiler having a combustion cell and a heat convection system and at least one jacket surrounding the combustion cell and the heat convection system.Boilers of central heating systems operating on fuel oil have a certain life time after which it becomes mandatory to renew them. Boilers are usually located at the basements of buildings. Since the usual dimensions of boilers do not permit the transport of the boiler through normal staircases or door openings of buildings it is necessary in the case of renewal of the boiler to have a boiler which can be assembled piece by piece in the boiler room, otherwise the tearing down of walls or doors becomes necessary.For boilers which operate on medium or heavy oil, the quantity of smoke coming out of the chimney must not be greater than 4 as measured by the Bacharach systems according to DIN standard . In most of the known and applied boiler constructions, when the amount of smoke is limited by 4, extra air input into the boiler is necessary which reduces the efficiency of the boiler.It is already known that by recirculating the hot gases resulting from the combustion to the initial point of the flame and having some portion dragged with the flame thus causing a better cracking of the fuel by the heat contained in the gas recirculation , the combustion process is highly improved resulting in a reduction in the quantity of smoke without a drop down in efficiency.However, since this technique can normally not be carried out in easy manner, this method has almost never been applied in the boilers of central heating systems.In almost all known boiler constructions,the combustion cell and heat convection system respectively the convective areas are located in the same jacket.Examples of known boiler constructions are shown in figures la ib, 2a 2b, 3a 3b and 4a 4b. As can be seen from these figures, in a half cylindrical boiler as well as in different cylindrical boilers the heat convention system 1 and the combustion cell 2 are located in one and the same jacket 4.The invention as claimed is intended to provide a new construction for a boiler which allows to dimension the boiler in such a way that the boiler can easily be delivered through normal passages of apartment houses and which enables recirculation of the combustion gases so that the quantity of smoke can be reduced below Bacharach 4 in cases where medium or heavy oil is burnt.One way of carrying out the invention is described below with reference to figures 5 and 6 in which Figure 5 shows a cross section through a specific embodiment and Figure 6 a longitudinal section through this em bodiment.As can be seen from Figure 6, the convective areas 1 , respectively the heat convection system, has a jacket 4 which is separated from the jacket 5 for the combustion cell 2 , so that the dimensions of the boiler can be made small enough to enable thetransport of the boiler through normal passages 79 cm width in case of 360.00 kcl h boiler, and 85 cm width in case of 500.000 kcl h boiler .In this embodiment the burner 3 is attached to the top of the combustion cell 2 so that the gases resulting from the primary combustion are recirculated to the initial point of the flame for a secondary combustion. By doing so, use is made of the heat in the gases for the recirculation in a very simple and easy way.According to the invention the boiler can be splitted into two parts along the middle line, as the drawings, due to the application of two cylind cal jackets 4 , 5 which essentially extend in horizontal direction, the jacket 4 for the vection system being arranged above the D for the combustion cell. The intermediate which connects the combustion cell 2 convection system, 1 can be divide and manufactured of steel profiles. Ta necessar it is possible to deliver the boiler the borler room in two parts and assemble it rc w. th ease.
