# Method for controlling viscosity of lubricating oils.

## Abstract
The viscosity of organic liquids at low temperatures is controlled by incorporating a minor amount of an ionic polymer and a cosolvent for the ionic groups of said polymer. The ionic polymer comprises a backbone which is substantially soluble in said organic liquid and pendant ionic groups which are substantially insoluble in said organic liquid, wherein such ionic polymer or terpolymer is formed from at least one acrylate or methacrylate monomer having at least eight carbon atoms and a minor portion of a sulfonate containing monomer. A cosolvent is selected which will solubilize the pendant ionomeric groups and provide a reasonably homogeneous mixture of solvent, cosolvent and ionomeric polymer.
