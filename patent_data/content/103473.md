# Alternating power supply for highly inductive loads.

## Abstract
An alternating power supply for a highly inductive load 1R comprises a variable DC source 10 , a unidirectional controlled switching thyristor T1 coupled to the DC source, an indicator L2 in series between the thyristor and the load and a capacitor C1 shunting the load. The thyristor T1 has a gate coupled to receive from a control circuit 15 a voltage signal functionally related to that across the load so that the thyristor T1 will be turned on at the frequency of oscillation of the voltage across the load to provide current pulses to the load.
