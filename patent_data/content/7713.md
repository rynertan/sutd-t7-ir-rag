# Method of synthesising imogolite and product of the method.

## Abstract
An inorganic material akin to imogolite is synthesised. Imogolite is a natural product having tubular structure and occurs in some soils. The synthetic product has tubes of 13 17 greater diameter, and is made thus Prepare an aqueous hydroxyaluminium silicate solution containing up to 0.5 molar aluminum and of pH 3.1 to 5.0 by acid hydrolysing aluminium alkoxides and introduced not earlier than the alkoxide tetraalkyl silicate. The atomic prop ortion of Si Al is up to 0.6 1. The solution thus prepared is digested, say at 96 C for a day, until a product is obtained displaying discernible electron diffraction peaks at 1.4Å, 2.1Å and 4.2Å.
