# Improvements relating to tickets, cards or the like.

## Abstract
The invention resides in that a lottery or other ticket or card comprises two sheet sections which are relatively hingeable, and hinging the sections causes erection of pop up panels defined in one sheet section by means of lines of cutting and creasing. The pop up panels not only give the ticket the novelty of surprise, but also serve as a means of security as when the ticket has been unfolded once, it retains a certain amount of permanent creasing which cannot be concealed by reclosing the ticket.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. A ticket or card which prior to being used is a generally flat structure and in order to gain access to the information or other material which is relevant to the use of the ticket or card and which is contained within the ticket a sheet section of the ticket must be relatively folded which has the effect of causing erection of at least one pop up panel of the ticket. 2. A ticket or card according to claim 1, wherein there are three pop up panels which are erected upon opening of the ticket or card. 3. A ticket or card according to claim 2, wherein the ticket has two sheet sections laminated together at one edge, the laminating serving as a hinge support enabling relative folding of the said sheet sections, about a hinge line therein and the said pop up panels are defined in said one of said sheet sections by cut lines and crease lines. 4. A ticket or card according to claim 3 wherein the said two sheet sections are also laminated at the edge region opposite said one edge, and to enable opening of the ticket, the said edge region is removed, a suitable tear line being provided for this purpose if necessary. 5. A ticket or card according to claim 3 or 4, wherein the said pop up panels comprise elongate panels defined by cut lines transversing a main hinge line in the said one sheet section, and crease lines in said panels being parallel but offset relative to said main crease line. 6. A ticket or card according to claim 3, 4 or 5, wherein said one sheet section has a security coating applied over the cuts and creases, which coating ruptures, indicating use of the ticket, when the ticket has been opened. 7. A ticket or card according to any preceeding claim, wherein the ticket has a third sheet section which has to be removed or torn open to allow access to the first and second sheet sections to enable unfolding of same. 8. A ticket or card according to claim 7, wherein the three sheet sect ins are laminated together and the periphery and a peripheral portion must be torn away to use the ticket, which has the effect of detaching the remainder of the third section from the first and second section, enabling them to be unfolded. 9. A ticket or card accordiny to claim 7, wherein the three sheet sections are laminated together round the periphery, and a portion of the third section must be torn to use the ticket leaving the first, second and third sections connected Z fahsion, so that the ticket can be opened by pulling the free edges of the third and first section and in the opened out ticket the third section can be tucked under the first section keeping the ticket in opened out condition. 10. A ticket or card according to claim 7, wherein the three sheet setions are laminated together round the periphery, and the third sheet section is adapted to be torn to enable panels thereof to be folded outwardly giving access to the second sheet section enabling the unfolding of same relativeto the first sheet sections. 11. A ticket or card according to claims 2 or 3, wherein there are only two sheet sections laminated together at one edge only. 12. A ticket or card according to any preceding claim, wherein the said information is between the first and second sheet sections and is printed matter covered by an irreversibly removable coating. 13. A ticket or card according to any of Claims 1 to 11, wherein said information or other material is between the first and second sheet sections and is matter printed so as not to be visible to the naked eye until activated by a suitable activating means. 14.

## Description
Tmrovements relatina to Tickets Cards or the likeThis invention relates to tickets cards or the like, especially but not exclusively to tickets or cards for use in lotteries. As the main application, as far as we are concerned, will relate to tickets or cards for use in lotteries, promotions, games reference is made herein mainly to lottery tickets, but it is to be remembered that the tickets need not be used in lotteries and can be used in other instances, a few of which are indicated herein.The invention has application to the instant type of lottery tickets that is to say, the tickets which the user uses as soon as he purchases or is given same, and followiny use, knows instantly whether or not a prize has been won. Obviously, as the tickets can be useo in this way, the security of same is very important, because if it is possible easily to ascertain wheter or not a ticket is a winer without it being evident that it has been tampered with, then unscrupulous agents and merchants will extract the winning tickets, and the lottery tickets will be thrown into disrepute.Therefore, it is usual to make the tickets as secure as possible and instant lottery tickets take a number of forms.One form of instant lottery ticket is the break open type or window type, which is a sealed ticket, and to gain access to the interior, and to the information relevant to the lottery, the user must physically break open the ticket. This can either be done by tearing away a portion of the ticket which allows other portions to unfold, or by tearing back a window or flap which is defined by lines of weakening in one portion of the ticket. These tickets are well known and are widely used, and typically one such ticket may comprise two sheet sections laminated together with adhesive, one section having lines of weakening defining several tear back tabs, typically three, which cover printed material on the other section, such printed material being for example representations of playing cards. The user uses the ticket by tearing back the flaps or windows to reveal the playing card prints. The tickets are instant lottery tickets insofar as the user knows instantly whether or not he has won a prize, and of course his act of tearing back the windows destroys the integrity of the ticket and therefore the person or organisation running the lottery knows immediately that the ticket has been used and is not reusable.In another form of instant ticket, the information relevant to the lottery is concealed by means of an opaque irreversibly removable coating, for example a latex based material, which is scratched away with a coin or the like to reveal the concealed information.Whilst these known tickets generally meet the requirements for seccurity, they do not do so perfectly and there is always room for improving the security of lottery tickets of the instant type, especially as the level of the prizes which can be won in such lotteries is always increasing.The present invention although it has wide application as will be explained herein, specifically provides a means of further increasing the security of instant lottery tickets and simultaneously the invention gives lottery tickets added customer appeal. According to the present invention there is provided a lottery ticket which prior to being used is a generally flat structure and in order to gain access to the information relevant to the lottery and which is contained within the ticket, two sheet sections of the ticket must be relatively folded which has the effect of causing erection of at least one pop up panel of the ticket.The ticket according to the invention acquires added security in that once the ticket has been unfolded to gain access to said information, there is relative folding in some panels results and this folding results in some permanent creasing of the material of the ticket, making it difficult if not impossible to return the ticket to the original flat state without it being obvious that the ticket has been opened and therefore used. Furthermore, the provision of pop up panels in a lottery ticket gives the ticket a novel presentation. The use of an instant lottery ticket, involving as it does anticipation on the part of the user, is perfectly complimented by the surprise achieved by panels popping up out of the ticket when the ticket is opened, giving the ticket according to the invention a synergistic effect.Preferably, there are three pop up panels which are erected upon opening of the ticket.Preferably also, the said two sheet sections are laminated together at one edge, the lamination serving as a hinge enabling relative folding of the sheet sections, and the said pop up panels are defined in one of said sheet sections by cut lines and crease lines.When the said information is concealed by opaque, irreversibly removable coating material, an extremely simple, two sheet section laminated ticket results, which can be left open at three sides. The cutting of the individual tickets from a large sheet of tickets results in that the two sections are held closely together by virtue of the cutting and also by virtue of the exclusion of air from between the sheets, whereas when the tickets has been opened, the folding of the pop up panels and the introduction of air between the sheets makes it impossible to return the ticket to that specific flat stage in which it exists prior to opening. This gives the ticket the added security without the need to seal it all round the edges.Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a lottery ticket according to one embodiment of the present invention Fig. 2 is a plan view of the inner of inner and outer blanks used in

the closed and open positions respectively Fig. 50 is a perspective view of a ticket accordiny to another embodiment of the invention and Fig. 51 shows in perspective view, the ticket of Fig.50 in the opened conditionReferring to Figs 1 to 5 of the drawings, the lottery ticket shown in Fig. 1 is for playing the card gauze Pontoon, and the ticket is sealed, and to use same three windows marked 1, 2 and 3 must be torn back along the lines of weakening 72, 74, 76 as more fully described herein , the result of which is tt,at three playing card representations are exposed, making up a hand of Pontoon.Depending upon the value of the hand, if it is in the range of 17 to 21, ten a prize is won, the prizes being indicated on the ticket and also indicated on the ticket is that windows 1 and 2 must be broken open and the player can stick with these two cards if he wishes, but if he breaks open wile third window to reveal the third card, then all tnree cards will count in computing the value of tie hand.Lottery tickets constructed to operate in this fashion are well known and widely used.In the present invention, however, the ticket is constructed so that when the flaps are torn open, the playing card representations will be carriea by portions of the ticket which pop up as indicated clearly in Fig. 4 out of the plane in which they would normally lie.To achieve this, the ticket of Fig 1 is constructed rrom two folded blanks, respectively shown in Figs. 2 and 3, and the two blanks being referenced generally A and B, as shown in Fig. 1, fit one within the otLjr. Referring now to the construction of the blanks in octal, in the Figures, crease lines on the blank are indicated by double dotted lines, whilst cut lines are indicated by full lines. The blanks will be of suitable sheet material such as cardboard.Referring to Fig. 2, the blank A is shown as being of rectangular form and is foldable about a central crease line 20 dividing the blank into two halves 22 and 24.The crease line 20 is interrupted by three spaced sections 26, 28 and 30, each of which is made up of aT shaped flap panel 32 of which the leg is bounded by cut lines 34, 36 and 38, and the arms are bound by crease lines 40 and 42. Each section also has retaining straps 44 and 48 which extend from crease line 42 in half 22 to crease line 50 in half 24. The section 26, and each of sections 28 and 30 is bounded on the sides by cut lines 52 and 54. By so constructing the section 26, and each of sections 28 and 30, when the blank A is unfolded about crease line 20, folding automatically takes place about fold lines 20, 40, 42 and 50, to cause the legs of flap panels 32 to stand upright. If unfolding is continued until the blank A is in flattened condition, each flap panel 32 folds flush onto the surface of section 22.Thus, the flap panels 32 are in fact pop up panels. To achieve this arrangement, the spacing between fold lines 40 and 42 should be equal to the spacing between fold lines 20 and 50. It is to be mentioned that it is not necessary for the flap panel to extend to fold line 50.Additionally, cut lines 56, 58 and 60 define a hinge panel 62 associated with the section 26 and ech of sections 28 and 30 , such hinge panel ensuring the erection of the flap panels in use of the ticket, as will be explained.It is to be mentioned that when the blank A is moved to the folded flattened condition, not only does flap panel 32 fold on to the surface of section 22, without projecting beyond the free edge 64, but also the hinge panel 62 overlies the flap panel 32 completely.Turning now to Fig. 3, the blank B is shown, and will be seen to comprise a rectangular blank which is foldable about fold line 66 into two halves 68 and 70 which are the same length as the halves 22 and 24 of blank A, but each is wider by an amount equal to the distanct between the fold lines 20 and 50, and 40 and 42, of the blank A. The section 70 is provided with lines of weakening 72, 74 and 76 defining three tearback tabs 78, 80 and 82 which are in fact tear back tabs indicated in Fig. 1, by the numerals 1, 2 and 3.The lines of weakening 72, 74 and 76 may be provided by making skip cuts in the material, leaving catch points connecting the tabs 78, 80 and 82 to the remainder of the section 70.The blank B is shown in chain dotted lines in Fig 3 in the position which it takes up in relation to blank A when the two are connected. The lower edge 64 of blankB is aligned with the lower edge 84 of blank A so that in fact the crease line 20 is displaced from the crease line 66. The respective blank halves 22 and 68 are secured together by means of adhesive along lines 86. When the blanks A and B are folded they fold about their respective lines 66 and 20 so as to come into theFig. 1 position, and during this folding the flap panels 32 of blank A fold upwardly and forwardly out of the plane of the blank half 22 and eventually lie on said half 22, as best illustrated by the sectional elevation of Fig. 5. The tear back tabs 78, 80 and 82 overlie and are adhered to the inge flaps 62 of the blank A respectively, and the periphery of section 70 is adhered along the lines 86 in order to seal the ticket.Finally, the three flaps 32, are shown as having printed information thereon respectively indicating playing cards seven of diamonds, ten of clubs and four of spades.If reference is now nade to Fig. 4, the utilisation of the ticket will be apparent, as will be the novel and surprising effect which can be achieved by the use of the ticket. In Fig. 4, the blank A is shown in full lines whilst the blank B in the interests of clarity is shown in chain dotted lines. To use the ticket, the user tears back tabs 1 and 2, taking with them the adhered hinge flaps 62 of blank B. The result is that the display flaps 32 are raised to the erected condition shown. The rules of play of the ticket and indicated thereon, may be as indicated peviously.Such a ticket will have considerable impact on the user, and will be much more pleasing than a ticket simply having the printed information on a flat surface of the ticket which remains in the plane of the ticket and it will be extremely difficult for the user to return the ticket to the closed coondition without it being obvious that it has been used.Two other erectable constructions of the many that are possible are shown respectively in Figs. 6 and 7.In Fig. 6, the locations of the crease lines 50, 42 and 40 are altered, so that whilst the parallelogram hinging arrangement is maintained, the pop up portion is defined by two panels 90 and 92, the panel 92 being connected by fold lines 40 and 4 anu currying tne playing card representation, and the panel 90 forming a link erectiny panel. To ensure automatic erection of the arrangement of Fig. 6, fold line 20 should be displaced from fold line 42 in the flat blank.In the arrangement of Fig. 7, adhered to the tear back tab 78 and 80 and 82 , is a lift panel comprising a rear section 94 adhered to the tab 78, and a display section 96 which is hinged to the sectitn 94 along line 98, and the free end of which is provided with holding tabs 100 which engage under the edges left in the covering section by tearing back of tab 78. With this arrangement, the lower edge of section 96 which is provided with the tabs 100 in fact slides longitudinally of the opening which exists in section 70 by tearing back of tab 78, as indicated by the arrow 102, to enable the section 96 to move to the erecred position.Referring now to Figs. 8 to 17 of the drawings, and initially to Figs. 8, 9 and 10, a ticket shown in Fig.8 comprises two sections 110 and 112 of cardboard or the like material which are adhered together in particular regions to be described when referring toFig. 10. The sections 110 and 112 are approximately of similar size, except that at one edge section 110 has an extension 110A which can be grasped by the fingers for the opening of the ticket by folding the section 110 as indicated by the arrow 114. Section 112 is a plain flat sheet with no cuts or ceeases therein but sectin 110 has cuts 116 and creases 118, 120, 122 and 124.The cuts 116 are parallel and of equal length, and pairs are joined by the fold lines 118 and 122 to define three panels 126, 128 and 130 which are divided into two equal sections 126B, 126ss, 128A 128X, 130A and 130X by the fold lines 120. The fold lines 124 are in alignment and define a first axis of folding , the fold lines 118 are in alignment and define second axis of folding, the fold lines 120 are in alignment and defind a third axis of folding, and fold lines 122 are in alignment and defind a fourth axis of folding.The four axes of folding are offset so that the panels 126, 128 and 130 will in fact pop up as shown in Fig.9 when the ticket is opened as indicated by the arrow 14. Because of the adherence of the respective sections of the ticket, section 110 tries to fold about all of the said axes, and in fact the panel 126, 128 and 130 pop up to the condition shown irj Fig. 9 exposing the under surfaces of the sections 126A, 128A and 130A which may for example carry information 132 indicated as A, B, C in Fig. 9 constituting a ganie of a lottery or information relative to a lottery.Additionally, the areas 134 and designated D, E, F andG in Fig. 2 on the face of section 112 which is exposed by the folding back of the panel 110 may also have printed thereon games of the lottery or infor.avion relevant to the lottery. This informatin is normally not ascertainable unless and until the ticket is broken open, but in an alternative construction the ticket could be foldable between the Figs. 8 and 9 positions without being broken open, but it would preferably be contained in a sealed evelope or package in such circumstances.In the plan view of Fig. 10, only the ticket section 110 is shown, and this figure also indicates the areas 136 and 138 whereat the section 110 is adhered by adhesive to the section 112. The section 136 extends fro the folds 118 to the adjacent edge of section 110, and also has finger portions 140 which extend to adjacent the fold lines 124. It will be seen therefore that no region of any of the pop up panels 126, 128 and 130 is adhered to section 112, and of the portions of section 110 between the said panels 126 to 130 only the portions which overlap fingers 140 are adhered to section 112. The area 138 which adheres section 110 to section 112 is such as to be rupturable, when the top section 10 is folded as described herein.It will be seen therefore that an extremely simple and novel construction results illustraing the advantage of combining the surprise of a pop up construction with a sealed unit which is always required in instant lottery games and the pop up combination games added security as explained herein.Instead of adhering the sections 110 and 112 as indicated in Fig. 10, alternative constructions are possible, and in Fig. 8, as illustrated by the dotted line 142, there may be a marginal region which is first of all torn away to enable the opening of the ticket as described herein. In one specific arrangement, there is a third layer which covers the outer surface of section 110. To use the ticket a sealeu marginal portion all round the ticket is torn away which causes the remainder of the third layer to separate, leaving a unit as illustrated in Fig. 1, without the extension 110A and, optionally without the adhesive area 138. Additionally, any information as required may be included in the regions A to G, and any required type of lottery game may be involved as desired. The areasA to G or any of them may if required be covered with an irreversibly removable coating material which is scraped away by using a coin or other implement to expose information relevant to the lottery but more detailed e lbodiments using this material are described herein.The tickets illustrated in Fig. 8 may each be made up of a single sheet of material folded in two to define sections 110 and 112, or may be made from separate sheets of material. In producing the tickets it will be desirable to produce these in quantity, and in this connection sheet fed or roll fed mechanisms may be used for the production of the tickets in quantity.The panels 126, 128 and 130 may be increased or decreased in number as desired, and may also be shaped as an alternative to or in addition to being provided with information such as A, B and C. The shaping of the panels 26, 28 and 30 may be such asto be relevant to the lottery i.e. the shapes may dictate whether or not the tickets are winners or losers, or the shapes may be utilised for promotional purposes or indeed for mechanical purposes as is the case in relation to the construction illustrated by Figs. 11 and 12.Referring to the construction illustrated in Figs. 11 and 12, the difference between the blank of Fig. 11 and that of Fig. 10, is that the cut lines 116 defining the panels 126, 128 and 130 are inclined as shown, so that the said panels 126, 128 and 130 in fact are of decreasing width in a direction from crease lines 118 to crease lines 122 and the leg portions between the panels 126, 128 and 130 are of decreasing width in the opposite direction. Additionally, the panels 126, 12tri and 130 have cut out step portions 126C, 128C and 13DC to define catch shoulders past which the leg portions snap and which trap the folded over leg portions between the panels as shown in Fig. 12, to keep the folded over section of the upper sheet 110 in the folded position.The shoulders 126C, 128C and 130C, therefore act as a lock keeping the panels 126, 128 and 130 in the erected position.Referring to the arrangement shown in Figs. 13 and 14, and 12, the difference between the blank of Fig. 11 and that of Fig. 10, is that the cut lines 116 defining the panels 126, 128 and 130 are inclined as shown, so that the said panels 126, 128 and 130 in fact are of decreasing width in a direction from crease lines 118 to crease lines 122 and the leg portions between the panels 126, 128 and 130 are of decreasing width in the opposite direction. Additionally, the panels 126, 128 and 130 have cut out step portions 126C, 128C and 130C to define catch shoulders past which the leg portions snap and which trap the folded over leg portions between the panels as shown in Fig. 12, to keep the folded over section of the upper sheet 110 in theLolded position.The shoulders 126C, 128C and 130C, therefore act as lock keeping the panels 126, 128 and 130 in the erected position.Referring to the arrangement shown in Figs. 13 and 14,Fig. 13 shows a blank having cut lines 150 defining a pop up panel, and transverse crease lines 152, 154, 156, 158 and 160 which extend across the width of the blank to define panels 162, 164, 166 and 168 and two tuck in ends 170 and 172. Panel 168 is provided with perforations or other lines of weakening 174 to define a tear back tab 176, whilst the cuts 150 extend into panels 164 and 166 to define a pop up section 178 having additional crease lines 180 and 181.To erect the blank of Fig. 13, it is first of all folded about crease line 156 in a direction upwardly of the paper, and it is also folded about crease lines 158 and 154 in the opposite direction i.e. downwards of the paper so as to bring the faces of panels 162 and 164 which are visible in Fig. 13 in face to face contact and similarly the faces of panel 166 and 168 are brought into face to face contact. The extensins 170 and 172 are tucked inwardly so that a four thickness structure, as shown in Fig. 14 results.The various layers are secured together except for the layers of the panel 178 and the flap 176, because the flap 176 is as shown inFig. 14 designed to be torn back to in fact raise the panel 178 to the parallelogram form of a pop up structure as shown in fig. 14, the purpose being to cause display of the representation in this case a playing card 182 on the front section of the popped up panel 178. The creasing of the panel 178 in fact defines three sectins 178A, 178B and 178C, and the section 178C is glued face to face with the tear back tab 176. Tearing back the tab 176 of course destroys the integrity of the ticket for the exposure of the information 182. In a production sample, there may be a number of the said flaps 176, but only one is illustrated in Figs. 13 and 14 in the interests of clarity. The reference numerals in Fig. 14 correspond with those indicated in Fig. 13.When the ticket is in the folded or closed condition, the crease line 156 will in fact be in register with the edge 186 of the tear back tab 176. The various layers will be glued together as aappropriate to provide a sealed unit, ani in the use cf the ticket, the flap 176 is torn back to provide pop up structure 178 for the display of information 182.When the ticket is constructed as shown in Fig. 8 or Fig. 12 and is not contained in a sealed envelope or package or is not provided with a third layer as described above, it will be possible to lift the panels 126, 128 and 130, for example by meons of the finger nail, in order to look at the informatin A, B and C without opening the ticket to the Fig. 9 position, therefore it may be possible to compromise the ticket without actually opening it. Of course, when the ticket has been opened as shown in Fig. 9, it will be apparent that it has been used because of the rupturiny of the adhesive region 138 and by the folding of the pop up panels.Figs. 15, 16 and 17 illustrate a technique by which compromising of a ticket with pop uip panels, such as the ticket of Figs. 8 or 12 by lifting the panels 126, 128 and 130 or by lifting the windows of a window game ticket such as is shown in Fig. 14 may be limited or avoided. A single panel 126 is shown in Fig. 15, and the two cut lines 116 and the fold lines 118, 120 and 124 are also shown. In the enlarged sectional view ofFig. 14, the cut lines 116 are shown as spaces in the material, and Fig. 16 also shows that the outer face of the section 110 is covered with a tearable coating or film 144 which may be applied in the fluent condition so that in fact it partially fills the slot 116 as indicated at 146 and also results in the provision of a flat covering surface 148.The coating 144 may be for example a latex based coating, and will be of a nature which has very little tensile strength, but which is coherent so tnat it can be clearly identified as extending over the cut lines 116. The coating may then be printed with a suitable pattern as indicated by numeral 150 which in the example comprises lines extending over the cut lines 116. It can be seen from Fig. 17, that as the sheet 110 is folded initially, and the panel 126 starts to erect, the material of pane1126 separates from theremainder of section 110, and by this action, tearing of the coating 144 would take place along the cut lines 116.Depending upon the nature of the coating, it is likely that when torn this would create a ragged edge, which would be a clear indentification that the ticket had been usec. Furthermore, by printing the pattern 150 over the panel 126, it would then become extremely difficult to reposition the section 110 to the flat condition and to match up the pattern lines. Again, an indication that the ticket had been opened would be evident.Tne concept of utilising a coating to bridge the edge of a portion of ticket which is to be moved relative to another portion of ticket is in itself an extremely important development in the field of lottery tickets, because considerable security is achieved by this simple means. The utilisation of a pattern over the coating enhances the security of the ticket even further, and the use of a coating is applicable to conventional lottery tickets such as the window game lottery tickets as shown in Fig. 14.In the embodiment of the invention shown in Figs. 18 to 21 the ticket is a sealed unit comprising three layers which are stuck together around a marginal region, which is removed by tearing in order to effet opening of the ticket. As shown in the exploded view of Fig.18, the three sheet sectins 210, 212 and 214 make up the ticket, the sections being of the same size. The outer sectins 210, 214 are plain card or paper sheets, whilst the centre section 212 is a card or paper sheet having slits and creasing somewhat similar to that of the sheet section shown in Figs. 8 and 10, but the slits 116 defining the foldable panels 126, 128 and 130 are stepped as shown by numeral 101 so that each panel 126, 128 and 130 comprises a wide portion 126A and a narrow portion 126B. This design facilitates folding of the panels 126, 128 and 130 during opening of the ticket. The various panels and creases already described in relation to said Figs. 8 and 10 are not described again, but to facilitate understanding, the same reference numerals as have been used in the saidFigs. 8 and 10 are used in Figs. 18 to 20.Each of the sheet sections 210, 212 and 214 is shown as having tear lines 216 around the entire periphery to define a margin 218 which as already explained in relation to Figs. 8 and 10, is removed to open the ticket. The said lines of weakening 216 may be provided in all three sheet sections 210, 212 and 214 simultaneously after laminating the sections, or they may be provided before the laminating. The sections will be parts of larger sheets which are laminated and subsequently cut into individual tickets.When the sections are laminated they are stuck together around the peripheral margin 218 and in addition centre section 212 is stuck to the lower section 214 in an area similar to the area 136 indicated in the Fig. 10, and as peculiar to this modification, the top section 210 is stuck to the centre section in area 220, which is inside the margin 218 so that the centre section 212 and top section 210 will remain connected in this area after removal of the margin 218.Figs. 19 to 20 illustrate how the ticket of Fig. 18 is opened. Assume that sections 210, 212 and 214 have been stuck together as described so that a sealed ticket results. Firstly, the user tears away the margin 218 of all three sheets around the periphery of the ticket, which leaves the edge 210A of section 210 and edge 214A of section 214 free for grasping with the fingers. These edges are so grasped and are pulled apart as shown by arrows 222 in Fig. l9, and the ticket starts to open concertina fashion, and the centre sheet 212 starts to fold about crease line 124 and the panels 126, 128 and 130 start to fold out of the plane of section 212 as shown in Fig. 19.Fig. 20 shows the ticket in a more advanced stage of opening and it will be seen that the panels 126, 128 and 130 are folded considerably about crease lines 120.Eventually when the folding about the crease line 124 has been completed, the top section 210 swings neatly under the lower sectiton 214 as shown in Fig. 21 serving a considerable advantage of folding the ticket in the fully opened out position, and the panels 126, 128 and 130 are folded out of the plane of the ticket for the effective presentation of the information as described herein.By so attaching the top section 210 to a centre section in area 220 and at the opposite side of the ticket from that to which the centre section 212 is connected to the lower section 214, an extremely functional construction results in that the edges 210A and 214A can be pulled apart, which is the most natural action for causing folding of the centre section about crease 124 and for inducing the panels 126, 128 and 130 to fold correctly and be presented in the popped up condition.Referring to Figs. 23 to 31 of the drawinys, the lottery ticket shown in Fig. 23 comprises, three sheet sections namely a top or first sheet section 310, a second or intermediate sheet section 312 and a third or bottom sheet section 314.Inside the periphery of the sheet section 310 is a line of weakening 314 defining tear back tab or section 316 which can be removed from the sheet section 310 by appropriate tearing. The section 316 is generally of rectangular form to conform with the shape of the sheet section 310, but at one side is provided with a tear initiation location 318 for commencing removal of the section 316 as will be explained, and at the opposite side, the tear line 314 is recessed to define a thumb grip recess 320. The form of the tear line 314 in certain regions may be important as to design as will be explained, in order to ensure that the section 316 tears effectively from the remainder of the sheet section 310 during the opening of the ticket. The sheet section 312 has a cut line 322 therein defining a foldable section 324 which can fold about a hinge line 326. Bridging the hinge line 326 are three pop up sectins 328, 330 and 332 each being a panel with a central fold line 328A, 330A and 332A, the panels being hinged at the ends respectively to the foldable section 324 and the remainder of sheet section 312. It will be noticed that the hinge lines 328A, 330A and 332A are offset relative to the hinge line 326j which provides for the pop up effect as will be described herein.The sheet section 314 is plain.The sheet section 310, 312 and 314 preferably are of a cardboard or cardboard like material of as thin a caliper as possible in order to ensure that the overall thickness of the ticket can be kept zs small as possible, but consistent with the ticket having a semirigid feel. To assemble the ticket, the sheet sectins 310, 312 and 314 are stuck together, and in practise the tickets will be produced in multiples by laminating large sheets together and cutting the laminated sheets into individual tickets. The tickets may be produced on sheet fed equipment or reel or web fed equipment as appropriate.The sheet sections 310, 312 and 314 of each individual ticket are stuck together as indicated by the hatching lines in Fig. 23. That is to say the sheet 314 is adhered to sheet 312 in the shaded area 334, whilst the sheet 312 is adhered to the sheet 310 in the shaded area 336 around the periphery or sheet 312, and also in the region of the free edge of the foldable section 324, as indicated by the cross hatching identified by numeral 338. This means in fact that the section 316 of the sheet 310 will be adhered to the foldable section 324 of sheet 312, but it is to be noted that the peripheral glue region 336 will in fact be outside the line of weakening 314.For the purposes of explaininy the use of the ticket, imagine that the sheets 310, 312 and 314 are stuck together in the glue regions described. To gain access, the tear back tab or section 316 must be removed and the user, as indicared in Fig. 24 inserts his fingernail in the initiation location 318 and then commences tearing of the tab 316 from the remainder of the sheet 310 as shown clearly in Fig. 24. With his other hand, the user now grips the opposite edge of the ticket, also shown in Fig. 24, and then pulls on the tab 316 with sufficient force to severe the entire tab 316 fron the sheet 310. Because the tab has to be separated from the ticket in this manner, the design of the tear line may be important, and the specific shape of tear line illustrated may not be the final design.It may be necessary for example to use echelon overlapping slits to ensure that the tearing occurs in a predetermined fahsion, and in fact Fig. 24 shows an arrangement of echelon slits at the side remote from which tearing is initiated.Fig. 25 shows the ticket in the state when the section 316 has separated from the remainder of sheet 310, andFig. 25 also shows how the respective parts of the ticket are gripped by the hands. Arrows 340 indicate that the gripped area 320 of the sheet sections is pulled in one direction, and the free edge of section 316 i.e. in the region of intiation location 318 is pulled in the opposite direction to cause opening out of the ticket. It should be mentioned that as the separated section 316 is glued to the edge of foldable section 324 opposite the hinge line 326, the section 316, foldable section 324 and the third sheet 314 are arranged in Z configuration, and the opening of the ticket is the opening out of the Z shape. Fig. 25 illustrates this clearly.If reference is now made to Fig. 26, it will be seen that the foldable section 324 has been folded beyond 90 degrees relative to the sheet section 314, and this has caused the pop up panels 328, 330 and 332 to fold out of the plane of the foldable section 324. Because the tear back section 316 is adhered to section 324, as opposed to being hinged thereto, with continued opening of the ticket, the section 316 is forced to turn as indicated by the arrow 342 until indeed the section 316 takes up the post ion lying to the underside of the sheet 314, as shown in Fig. 27, which is the fully opened condition of the ticket.This positioniny of the sheet section 316 to the underside of section 314 is highly desirable insofar as it serves to keep the ticket in the erected condition shown in Fig. 27, in which the pop up panels 328, 330 and 332 have reached the fully popped up position in which they lie out of the plane of section 324 and present display surfaces for viewing by the ticket user.In Fgs. 28 and Fig. 29, reference numerals which have already been used in describing the embodiment of Figs.23 to 27 are used again to designate corresponding parts, in order to avoid repetition of explanation.the difference between the Figs. 28 and 29 embodiment and the Figs. 23 to 27 embodiment resides in that in the Figs. 28 and 29 embodiment, each sheet section 210, 312 and 314 has an edge region 310A, 312A and 314A which is adapted to be detached during the opening of the ticket by the provision of a line of perforations 310B, and 312B the cut line 322 being omitted. Wflen the ticket is sealed, the lines of perforations 310B, 312B and 314B are in alignment and the edge regions 310A, 312A and 314A are stuck together.To open the ticket, the user tears off the adhered edge regions 310A, 312A and 314A as shown in Fig. 29, commences the tear initiation at location 318 as shown in Fig. 24, until tear back tab 316 is detached from the remainder of the sheet 310, and then the free edge of tab 316 and the opposite edge of sheet 314 are gripped and pulled apart in the same manner as described in relation toFigs. 23 and 27 until the ticket is placed in the opened condition corresponding to the position shown inFig. 27. Fig. 29 shows the ticket according to this embodiment in the partly open condition corresponding to the partly open condition of the Fig. 23 embodiment of the ticket shown in Fig. 26. In the embodiment of Figs. 30 and 31, again reference numerals which have been used previously are used to indicate parts already described.In the modification of Figs. 30 and 31, instead of the top sheet 310 having an initition location 318, it has a rip strip 318A which is removed completely by grasping a free tab at one end 318B with the fingers and by pulliny the strip 318A away from the remainder of the sheet 310. In opening the ticket, the removal of rip strip 318A is efrected after the removal of adhered edges 310A, 312A and 314A as described herein and as illustrated in Fiy.31. This action leaves the edge 318A of tear back tab 316 free for gripping with the fingers in a manner similar to that indicated in Fig. 24 to detach the tab from. the remainder of the sheet 310 and to effect opening of the ticket as indicated in Fig. 31, which also shows the detached rip strip 318A , and as fully described herein. The features of usiny a rip strip can be embodied in any embodiment of ticket as described herein. The areas indicated by numerals 344 and 346 on sheet section 314 and the popped sections 328 to 332 as shown in Fig. 21 but which will also be present in the Figs.28 and 29 and Figs. 39 and 31 embodiments, may carry information relative to the lottery, game or promotion in connection with which the ticket is to be used, but it is to be mentioned that the popped up panels can be any desired configuration, and could be used for display and promotional purposes.In a modified version of the arrangement shown in Figs.30 and 31, the rip strip 318A is defined so that it remains attached to section 310 after being torn back to enable the opening of the ticket as shown in Fig.31.Referring to Figs. 32 to 35 of the drawings, in Fig. 32 three sheet sections 410, 412 and 414 of a ticket according to the invention are shown. The sheets may be of cardboard or other flat material suitable for the manufacture of tickets. The centre section 412 is provided with cut lines 16 and crease lines 420 and 422 so that ther are defined in the sheet section 412 three pop up panels 424, 426 and 428 and a hinge panel 430. The free edge of the hinge panel 430 is defined by a line of perforations 432 defining an edge 434 which, in the opening of the ticket is removed from the sheet section 412 as will be explained. When said edge 434 is removed, the panel 430 can fold about hinge line 420, which has the effect of causing the pop up panels 424, 426 and 428 to pop up o the erected position as shown in Fig. 35.The top sheet 410 is provided with perforations defiiiing a rip strip 436, tear lines 438 defining two hinge flaps 440 and crease lines 442 about which the hinge flaps 440 can be hinged as will be explained. A further line of perforations 444 defines an edge 446 which is removed in the opening of the ticket as will be explained.The sheet 414 has a single line of perforations 448 to define an edge 450 which is removed in the opening of the ticket. The cross hatching area 452 shown on sheet 414 indicates the area over which the sheet 414 is adhered to sheet 412, whilst the cross hatching 454 on sheet 412 indicates the area peripheral region over which the sheet 412 is adhered to the sheet 410.Fig. 33 shows the ticket in the sealed condition in which the sheets 410, 412 and 414 are adhered in the areas 452 and 454. To open the ticket, the ticket is torn along the aligned lines of perforation 444, 432 and 450 of the respective sheets to detach the edge region 456 of the ticket. Next, the rip strip 436 is torn away as shown in Fig. 33, the end 436A defining a tab engageable by the fingers. After tearing away the strip 436, the hinge flaps 340 are torn back along lines 438 as shown in Fig. 34 in order to expose the centre sheet 412 and in particular the hinge panel 430 the free edge of which can now be engaged by the fingers and the panel 430 can be folded back as indicated by the arrow 458 in Fig. 34.When the panel 430 has been folded back as indicated by arrow 458, by 180 degrees, the position shown in Fig. 31 is reached in which the ticket is fully open displaying for example, on the erected pop up panels 424, 426 and 428 the information relevant to the lottery or game.The panels 424, 426 and 428 may be shaped and printed to provide promotional or other displays in addition to or as an alternative to the panels carrying infornation relevant to the lottery.In the arrangement shown in Fig. 37, there is no initial separation of the edge portion, and therefore the lines of perforations 444, 432 and 450 of the Fig.32 embodiment are omitted, but the sheet 412 is provided with a tear line 460 connecting the edge cut 416, the tear line being defined by a lift tab 462 from the edges of which extend lines of perforations 464 with the perforations arranged in echelon formation so that the sheet 412 will tear predictably when the tab 462 is engaged and pulled in an upwards direction.Fig. 37 shows the position after the tab 462 has been engaged and the sheet 412 torn along the echelon tear lines 464, releasing the panel 430 for folding in the manner indicated by arrow 458 in Fig. 34, to cause erection of the pop up panels 424, 426 and 428. InFig. 37 the panel 430 has been folded by zn initial amount, and the pop up panels 424, 426 and 428 have also started to fold out of the plane of panel 430.The advantage of the Fig. 36 and 37 embodiment is that the only portion of the ticket which is disposed of is the rip strip 436. It should be mentioned that indeed the rip strip can be eliminated and instead of the rip strip 436 there is provided a central line of perforations and to open the ticket the user simply tears back the two hinge panels 440. Also, instead of having two hinge panels 440, the top sheet 410 may be provided with a single hinge panel which is torn back to expose the foldable portion of the centre sheet 412.The single panel may hinge for example about an axis lying along one of the crease lines 442 or along the line of perforations 438 or the line of perforations 440. Referring to Figs. 30 to 42 of the drawings, the ticket comprises two sheet sections 510 and 512 of cardboard or like material which are laminated together in the glue region indicated by numeral 514.The sheet section 510 has cut lines 516 therein to define three pop up panels 518, 520 and 522 which have a central hinge line and are hinged to the remainder of the sheet 510 along the hinge lines indicated by the double dotted lines. The main hinge line 520 in the sheet 510, which does not traverse the pop up panels 518, 520 and 522 divides the sheet 510 into a rear section 510A which is glued to the sheet section 512 and a front section 510B which is hinged in the opening of the ticket as will be explained.Each sheet section 510 and 512 is provided with three lines of perforations 524, 526 and 528 which along three sides of the ticket lie inside the glue region 514 to enable the peripheries of the three sections to be removed by tearing on lines 524, 526 and 528 as will be explained.Fig. 39 shows the ticket in sealed condition, and Fig.40 shows in fact how the pop up panels, such as panel 522, can be lifted by means of a knife 530 or similar impliment without opening the ticket, and any printed information inside the ticket could be indentified by this method whereby the ticket would be compromised.However, in accordance with the present embodiment of the invention, the information relevant to the lottery which is printed on the inner faces of the sheets 510 and 512 or one of such sheets, is covered by an opaque removable mask material and therefore any attez,apt at compromising the ticket by the method illustrated inFig. 40 would be futile, because the relevant information or a vital part of the relevant information would be covered by means of the removable mask coating.The usefulness of covering the information in this fashion is best explained by describing the opening of the ticket and in this connection reference is now made to Figs. 41 and 42.To open the ticket, in the first step the user tears along the lines of perforations 524, 526 and 528 to remove the peripheral portions along the relevant edges as indicated in Fig. 41, and in this condition the front portion 510B of the top sheet 510 can be folded back as indicated by arrow 532 in Fig. 4, the sheet section 510 folding along the hinge line 520. With this folding action, the panels 518, 520 and 522 pop up as shown in Fig. 41 as they fold about the crease lines connecting the panels to the remainder sheet 510 and also about their centre fold lines.Fig. 42 shows the ticket in the fully open condition and it will be seen that the section 510B has been folded about hinge line 520 by 180 degrees, revealing the printed. information, such as information 534 of the ticket and it will also be seen that on the faces of the pop up panels 518, 520 and 522 which are presented to the user of the ticket there are opaque removable coatings 536. To use the ticket, the user scrapes away the coatings 536 to reveal the information sealed thereby, and in pop up panels 522 in Fig. 42 partial removal of the coating 536 as illustrated will be seen that the information being revealed is five of spades . Depending upon the information revealed so the ticket can be a winning ticket or not. Of course it is to be appreciated that the acutal content of the printed information can be any desired for the playing of any one or more games, and fewer or more areas can be covered by the coating.Instead of the coating being a mask which is abraded by scraping, it may be a mask which is removed by peeling.By so concealing the printed information, it will be seen that the ticket illustrated in Fig. 39 is still very secured because viewing of the interior of the ticket by the compromising method indicated in Fig. 40 will not achieve the desired result.In the embodiment of the invention illustrated in Figs.43 and 44 the ticket is made up of two sections 500 and 502 which are securely glued together only in the region 504 indicated by cross hatching. The ticket in section 500 is only a single pop up panel 506 and the panel is identical to the pop up panels already described except for additional cut lines 508 to define a portion which will stand above the pop up panel central fold line.Fig. 43 shows the ticket in the opened condition in which section 500A has been folded by 180 degrees about the fold line 501 causing the panel 506 to pop up as indicated in Fig. 43, and it will be seen that the extension portion defined by cut lines 50 projects upwardly beyond the central fold line ofthe panel 506.In fact the face of the panel 506 which is viewed when the ticket is open is for the presentation of advertisement or other promotional material 511. On the portion of sheet 502 previously covered by panel portion 500A there are areas 513 covered by opaque irreversibly removable coating material. To use the ticket, the user scratches away this material to reveal the concealed information in order to ascertain if a prize has been won in the lottery. By way of example, the first area 513 has been shown with largely all of the coating material removed revealing the numbers 3, 7 and 5.The sheet section 500A and sheet 502 may be left completely llconnected, hence the reason why the ticket is described as an open ticket or, to facilitate production spots such as 515 of a light adhesive could be provided between these sections in order to hold them together during manufacture and transportion, but the adhesion of such adhesive can be overcome readily when the user opens the ticket.In a modified forms of this embodiment, instead of a removable mask or coating, a third sheet for security may be provided, the third sheet lying between the first and second sheets, the third sheet being folded back or torn away after the ticket has been opened and in this case the informatin to be concealed will be on the lower sheet so that the third sheet prevents it from being viewed by the compromising method indicated in Fig. 40.Referring to Figs. 45 to 47 of the drawings, the ticket comprises two sheet sections 610 and 612 of cardboard or the like material which are laminted together in the glue region indicated by numeral 614.The sheet section 610 has cut lines 616 therein to define three pop up panels 618, 620 and 622 which have a central hinge line and are hinged to the remainder of the sheet 610 along the hinge lines indicated b the double dotted lines. The main hinge line 623 in the sheet 6109, which does not traverse the pop up panels 618, 620 and 622 divides the sheet 610 into a rear section 610A which is glued to the sheet section 612 and a front section 610B which is hinged in the opening of the ticket as will be explained.Eachsheet section 610 and 612 is provided with a line of perforations 624, which extends along the edge of the ticket opposite the glue region 614 to enable the edge regions 626, 628 to be removed by tearing on lines 624, as will be explained.Fig. 45 shows the ticket in sealed condition, and Fig.46 shows in fact how the pop up panels, such as panel 622, can be lifted by means of a knife 630 or similar impliment without opening the ticket, and any printed informatin inside the ticket could be identified by this method whereby the ticket would be compromised.However, the information relevant to the lottery which is printed on the inner faces of the sheets 610 and 612 or one of such sheets, is covered by an opaque removable mask material and therefore any attempt at compromising the ticket by the method illustrated inFig. 46 would be futile, because the relevant information or a vital part of the relevant information would be covered by means of the removable mask coating.The usefulness of covering the information in this fashion is best explained by describing the opening of the ticket, and in this connection reference is now made to Fig. 47.To open the ticket, in the first step the user tears along the lines of perforations 624, to remove the edge regions as indicated in Fig. 47, and in this condition the front portion 610B of the top sheet 610 can be folded back as indicated by arrow 632 in Fig. 47, the sheet section 610 folding along the hinge line 623.With this folding section, the panels 618, 620 and 622 pop up as shown in Fig. 47 as they fold about the crease lines connecting the panels to the remainder sheet 610 and also about their centre fold lines. Fig.47 shows the ticket in the fully open condition and it will be seen that the section 610B has been folded about hinge line 620 by 180 degrees, revealing the printed information, such as information 634 of the ticket and it will also be seen that on the faces of the pop up panels 618, 620 and 622 which are presented to the user of the ticket there are opaque removable coatings 636. To use the ticket, the user scrapes away the coatings 636 to reveal the information concealed thereby, and in pop up panel 622 in Fig. 47 partial removal of the coating 636 as illustrated will be seen that the information being revealed is five of spades . Depending upon the information revealed so the ticket can be a winning ticket or not.Of course it is to be appreciated that the actual content of the printed information can be any desired for the playing of any one or more games, and fewer or more areas can be covered by the coating. Instead of the coating being a mask which is abraded by scraping, it may be maks which is removed by peeling.By so concealing the printed information, it will be seen that the ticket illustrated in Fig. 45 is still very secure because viewing of the interior of the ticket by the compromising method indicated in Fig. 47 will not achieve the desired result. Also, because the sheet sections are free at the edges 625 and 627, the manufacture of the ticket is much simplified, the cost of manufacture is reduced, and ppening of the ticket is simpler. Even further advantages as regards production are achieved by the embodiment of the invention shown inFigs. 48 and 49. In the embodiment of the invention illustrated in Figs. 48 and 49, the ticket is made up of two sections 600 and 602 which are securely glued together only in the region 604 indicated by cross hatching. The ticket in section 600 is only a single pop up panel 606 and the panel is identical to the popup panels already described except for addtional cut lines 608 to define a portion which will stand above the pop up panel central fold line.Although the edyesA, B and C are free, in fact is has been found that by cutting the tickets from large sheets, in the cutting action, the shearing of the laminated sheets causes the sheets 600, 602 to adhere at the regions A, B and C quite firmly, until the seal is broken by the manual opening of the ticket.Fig. 48 shows the ticket in the opened condtion in which section 600A has been folded by 1980 degrees about fold line 601 causing the panel 606 to pop up as indicated in Fig. 48, and it will be seen that the extension portion defined by cut lines 608 projects upwardly beyond the central fold line of the panel 606.In fact, the face of the panel 606 which is viewed when the ticket is open, is for the presentation of advertisement or other promotional material 603. On the portion of sheet 602 previously covered by panel portion 600A there are areas 607 covered by opaque irreversibly removable coating material. To use the ticket, the user scratches away this material to reveal the concealed information in order to ascertain if a prize has been won in the lottery. By way of example, the first area 609 has been shown with largely all of the coating material removed revealing the numers 3, 7 and 5.The sheet section 600A and sheet 602 may be left completely unconnected, hence the reason why the ticket is described as an open ticket or, to facilitate production, spots such as 611 or a light adhesive could be provided between these sect ins in order to hold them together during manufacture and transportation, but the adhesion of such adhesive can be overcome readily when the user opens the ticket.In a modified form of this embodiment, instead of a removable mask or coating, a third sheet for security may be provided, the third sheet lying between the first and second sheets, the third sheet being folded back or torn away after the ticket has been opened and in this case the information to be concealed will be on the lower sheet so that the third sheet prevents it from being viewed by the compromising method indicated in Fig. 46.Referring to Figs. 50 and 51 of the drawings, the ticket comprises two sheet sections 710 and 712 of cardboard or the like material which are laminated together in the glue region indicated by numeral 714.The sheet section may be formed by folding a single sheet in two, but preferably will be constructed from two sections of two larger sheets providiny a plurality of the tickets when suitably guillotined.The sheet section 710 has cut lines 716 therein to define three pop up panels 718, 720 and 722 which have a central hinge line and are hinged to the remainder of the sheet 710 along the hinge lines indicatd by the double dotted lines. The main hinge 723 in the sheet 710, which does not traverse the pop up panels 718, 720 and 722 divides the sheet 710 into a rear section 710A which is glued to the sheet section 712 and a front section 710B which is hinged in the opening ticket as will be explained.Fig. 50 shows the ticket in closed condition, and although the inside of the ticket can be examined by opening the sections slightly, the information relevant to the lottery which is printed on the inner faces of the sheets 710 and 712 or one of such sheets, is in fact invisible and can only be made visible by the application thereto of a special activiating tool or material, so that compromise of the ticket without the tool or instrument is not possible. The usefulness of making the information invisible is best explained by describing the opening of the ticket and in this connection reference is now made to Fig.51.To open the ticket the front portion 710B of the top sheet 710 is folded back as indicated by arrow 732 in fig. 51, the sheet section 710 folding along the hinge line 723. With this folding action, the panels 710, 720 and 722 pop up as shown in Fig. 51 as they fold about the crease lines connecting the panels to the remainder sheet 710 and also about their centre fold lines. Fig. 51 shows the ticket in the fully open condition and it will be seen that the section 710B has been folded about hinge line 720 by 1800, revealing the printed information, such as information 734 of the ticket and it will also be seen that on the faces of the pop up panels 718, 720 and 722 which are presented to the user of the ticket, there are areas 736 containing the invisible images.To use the ticket, the user hands the ticket to the person in the store who has the special tool or material which is applied to the area 736 to reveal the hidden images, and in pop up panels 722 in Fig. 5 partial exposure of the hidden information is obtained as illustrated, and it will be seen that the information being revealed is five of heattssl. Depending upon the information revealed so the ticket can be a winning ticket or not.Of course it is to be appreciated that the actual content of the printed information can be any desired for the playing of any one or more games, and fewer or more areas with invisible images can be provided.By concealing the printed information using invisible images, it will be seen that the ticket illustrated is still very secure because viewing of the interior of the ticket for compromising the ticket will not achieve the desired result. Also, because the sheet sections are free at three edges, the manufacture of the ticket is much simplified, the cost of manufacture is reduced, and opening of the ticket is simpler. The ticket can of course be sealed around one or more of the edges as desired.The general concept of defining pop up panels in a single sheet connected to a base and which is foldable about a main hinge line, by means of cutting and creasing, has wide application beyond that of lottery tickets and promotional cards. For example, the invention can be used for business cards, greetings cards, cards for printing products, and the like.Any feature of any embodiment disclosed in this specification can be used in conjunction with any other embodiment as appropriate. For example the use of a laquer coating over the pop up panels to provide additional security as explained in relation to the embodiment of Figs. 15 to 17, can be used in conjunction with any other embodiment. The present invention has provided a novel construction in lottery tickets, and the embodiment of a pop up panel as explained herein provided some additional security because when the relative sheet sections have been relatively folded to cause popping up of the one or more panels, the residual strain in the sheet material caused by the folding and popping up is an indication that the ticket has been used. This especially applies in the case of the embodiments comprising two sheets secured together at one edge only. Furthermore, the novelty of the present invention can be used in tickets other than lottery tickets which are for one time useage. Such tickets may be for examaple educational tickets, novelty or game tickets.
