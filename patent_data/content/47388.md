## Description
COMPUTER AIDED DESIGN SYSTEMField of the Invention The invention is concerned with circuit design, and in particular to the automation and optimization of circuit design using computer aided techniques.Background of the Invention There are various methods of computer aided design systems known in the prior art. The most widely used systems utilize the so called polygonal methodology in which mask polygons are the primary means of describing the microelectronic circuit layout. The polygons for each mask layer are first described using a layout grid, and then subsequently are entered into the computer by digitizing the data, or using an electronic pen tablet. The design rule checking is performed by relational pair comparing of intramask and intermask polygons. The salient deficiency in the prior art computer aided design methodology is the difficulty of the designer in conducting automatic circuit analysis, logic simulation and layout verification with respect to arriori device functions and performance objectives. The prior art methodology also possesses problems with respect to the design portability to various fabrication processes. Examples of prior art computer aided design systems are discussed in the patents and technical literature listed in the next sections. ReferencesR. P.

The system is specialized for the device designer to provide an interactive facility for manipulating layout primitives points, lines, areas in composing circuit topology on a color graphics display.The description herein defines the primary algorithms and concepts underlying the generation of mask geometries related to the color enhanced symbolic design. The mask geometries algorithm described enables the device designer to interactively explore intra and inter mask geometry relationships. This color graphics exploration can be performed in concert with lithography and process engineering. It is anticipated that the future need for mask color guides used for visual examination of intra and inter mask geometry relationships will be virtually eliminated. This cost reduction could be substantial when considering the elapsed time delay in receiving color guides with present technology. One defines a versatile mask geometries algorithm that is optimal for interactive color graphics processing. A language is utilized to define the mapping variables required to determine the geometrical relationships implied in the symbolic design. The analytical and conceptual aspects underlying the mask geometries algorithm are defined to a level where software development activities could commence. An example is also described to provide the reader with an insight into the mechanics of the algorithm and the associated date requirements. The system according to the present invention given the name pCAD is specialized for the device designer so that circuit and logic functions are easy to mentally construct and graphically compose.Symbolic representations of circuit structures are displayed and manipulated interactively on a color graphics display to promote the computer aided translation of function into topology without regard to mask geometric details. The device designer is uncoupled from the process world and need not anticipate all the process variations in order to capture the solution of an immediate applications opportunity in a workable custom VLSI design. The device designer thinks at a higher level of abstraction which allows these improvements in productivity 1 layouts can be performed by a multitude of remote design communities, closer to the applications, than in the prior art practice 2 symbolic manipulation can be used as a short hand methodology for quickly exploring circuit and layout alternatives. 3 changes in processing techniques can be exploited without requiring detailed redesign of existing circuits. This includes very selective reductions in dimensions on any mask layer 4 a uniform interpretation is applied to each symbol transforma tion automatically, according to rules defined by processing requirements. The transformations can realize arbitrary geometric detail with a full exercise of advantages based on symbol environment 5 the creation, transmission, and storage of detailed design information is greatly reduced 6 the communications of essential design information is concisely summarized in compact tables 7 designs are portable into different factories without concerns about mask details peculiar to each process.New mask layers and or different local dimensions can be defined, at will, and quickly rederived from the symbolic design. It must be realized that a dimension of any micro structure cannot be characterized by a single number. Dimensions change systematically as masks are made and as wafers are processed through a variety of steps. The designer thinks in terms of a nominal dimension which characterize electrical phenomena. The process operator sees a range of dimensions through microscopic inspection of the wafers. First, the operator sees the dimension of a developed image in photoresist, then the dimension transforms by etching into an oxide layer, and finally it is observed as an end result in a d dimensional structure. The mask makers see the results of plotters and changes during photo reduction step and repeat to make working tools. FIG. 1 illustrates the sequence of systematic changes in dimensions DN associated with the physical structures in a VLSI device. The sequence is shown as five steps from the CAD, to the working mask, to photolithography, and finally to the physical device itself. The accounting mechanism utilized to correct for these systematic dimensional changes is the correction variable C. C AM AL Ap tE then DN C AM AL Ap tE DE and after cancelling DN EE then the nominal dimensions associated with the CAD is equal to the physical dimensions DE. The correction variable C is a budget which makes it possible for different people having different fabrication perspectives to communicate coherently and precisely about their part of the action.The fabrication community stays calibrated. When geometric details are required, for example, during analysis of symbol interrelationships, pCAD can generate a colored overlay of the geometric shapes within an arbitrary peek window from the symbolic design. The impact on productivity of this capability to overlay geometric masking details in a color graphics presentation according to the present invention is significant. Light tables are not required since it is not necessary to view stacks of blow backs color guides of the mask layers in order to investigate detailed relationships and measurements. The electronic color graphic displays are more precisely aligned and more viewable. Variable magnification and superimposed micro rulers aids in the analysis of geometric detail with the goal of eliminating conceptual errors. Further, this presentation is transmittable to the device processing personnel to provide in line inspection criteria. The pCAD software architecture to support the interactive color graphics display of mask geometries can be represented pictorially inFIG. 2. FIG. 2 shows the module level design world representing the various software functions used in the CAD system. These include a graphics match manager, a symbolic designer, a symbolic layout verifier, a symbolic design rule checker, the pCAD manager, the symbolic logic simulator, the symbolic circuit analyzer, the data manager, the mask geometries displayers, and the module characterizer. The data manager interfaces with external symbolic designs or process libraries. The module characterizer characterizes the module which is designed by the pCAD system and transmits the data associated with the design module to a module library.It is then possible that this module library be used by various design communities as well as a module component in a pCAD system for designing systems on the device level. The mask geometries display software is an interactive processing package that extracts a window or portion of the symbolic design representing a module and transforms it into mask polygons, The module characterization software is a batch oriented package that will transforn the entire symbolic design of a module into a complete mask set. It will also characterize the module boundary and signal interface requirements so paper modules may be pen plotted for use in device architectural studies involving module arrangement, placement, signal interface bussing design and device testability. These data will be telecommunicated to the central module library for storage and availability to the macroCAD mCAD system The establishment of a module library will provide the device designer with a reportoire of previously designed modules to select from.This will be a means of reducing the level of custom design effort associated with VLSI devices leading to still greater productivity improvements. One of the cardinal tenets underlying pCAD is the concept of utilizing color to enhance symbolic design methodology. Color provides a third dimensional effect. Color is already used by the device designer for manually expressing his circuit topology on grided mylar using colored pencils. The three dimensional effect of utilizing color to enhance symbolic designs also naturally relates to the multilevel three dimensional construction of the device i.e., n and p diffusion, poly silicon and aluminum. All these factors result in improving designer interpretation of VLSI symbolic designs which correspondingly improves designer productivity. Since the conventional layout digitizing function consumes time and does not technically enhance the device design, pCAD proposes to eliminate the layout digitizing activities. This is accomplished through the utilization of interactive color graphics techniques that will enable the device designer to compose and explore alternate topological mechanizations with computer aid. The design evolves as a pictoral form in color which is referred to as the concept of color enhanced symbolic design. The highly interactive input output relationships, coupling the designer and the computer in a synergistic environment, is the power being captured and utilized in the pCAD concept. In pCAD, the device designer utilizes design primitives to translate his mental imagings into the color enhanced symbolic design displayed on the graphics screen. The repertoire of primitives available to the designer in pCAD is any combination of abstract topological structures composed of points lines, and or areas including polygons. These symbolic design primitives can be defined as follows, using standard BNF notation EMI16.1 where the indicates an optional variable. The PLA set of primitives represents the basic capability implemented in pCAD. The PLA set of primitives establishes the procedural mechanics available to the designer in composing a symbolic design. Extending the rectangular area to arbitrary polygons bridges the gap between symbolic design and the more conventional polygonal design. The PLAP set of primitives provides the designer with an extremely versatile means of composing symbolic designs rectilinear masking that incorporates angular masking capabilities. Any reference to symbolic design primitives in the remainder of this application refers to the PLA set of primitives only. PLA Primitive Relationships This section will discuss the masking relationships between the combinations of primitive pairs i.e., point point, point line, pointarea, line line, line area, and area area. A set of binary relational parameters are defined that universally apply to PLA primitive relationships in generating mask geometries to realize continuity, cover and protect features The continuity contiguousness feature describes the primitive pair relationship where the two mask rectangles associated with each primitive must be merged into a homogeneous polygon.The symbolic design is assumed to be referenced to a uniform grid with a scaling interval of A. If two primitives are adjacent, a x 1 relationship in X or Y, the merging rule is that the smaller width edge is mapped on the larger edge to form a mask polygon. The cover and protect features are analogous to the present tgapping concept that has existed for several years in conventional mask generation algorithm. It has been decided that gapping is a misnomer and should be deleted from pCAD linguistics. In this section, cover is analogous to orthogonal gapping and protect is analogous to diagonal gapping with regard to describing influence of symbol environments on mask geometries. Consequently, cover and protect will be the terms used to describe second order influences on primitive mask geometries.The cover feature is used when a primitive is influencing another primitive with a X 1 relationship in X or Y, such that the mutual edge is pushed or pulled to produce an overlap or cover effect.Similarly, the protect feature is used when a primitive is influencing another primitive with a X 1 relationship in both X and Y such that the mutual vertex is pushed back to exclude or protect a sensitive structure. Thus, it can be seen that the cover and protect features provide a means of achieving higher density within a specific set of process ground rules. Binary Relational Parameters In CAD, the process of composing a color enhanced symbolic design by the device designer is via a repertoire of primitives.These symbolic design primitives can be categorized as points, lines and areas hence we refer to the primitive set as PLA. Since an imaginary uniform grid is superimposed on the color graphics screen, each point is defined as a vertex and each line and area as a vertex pair. Each vertex consists of an X and Y coordinate related to a page offset representing the peek window reference. It should be noted here that in pCAD the designer is completely insulated from maintenance of X, Y coordinates since the mapping of primitives on the color graphics screen is via a cursor, It is only the software that is intimately concerned with the maintenance of X, Y coordinates defining primitive placement. An incidence rectangle surrounding each PLA primitive will be defined such that each edge defining the incidence rectangle is A 1 from the defining vertex or vertex pair of the PLA. This can be illustrated in FIG. 3a, b, and c. In classifying the relationship between two PLA primitives, it can be seen that the relationship between any candidate PLA vertex and a reference PLA incidence rectangle can be categorized into one of four possible classes namely, interior, boundary, boundary corner, and exterior. The need to classify the relationship between two PLA primitives is to enable the mask geometries algorithm to perform appropriate mask geometry modification for contiguous, cover and protect situations. The incidence rectangle, illustrated with dashed lines in FIG. 4 is defined by the vertex pair XlR YlR , X2R Y2R which correspondingly defines the boundary edges associated with the reference PLA primitive. The relationship of any candidate vertex associated with a PLA primitive and an edge defining the boundary rectangle of the referencePLA primitive is defined as Half Plane Binary Parameters al, 2 a3 a4 where aj 1 if vertex is in half plane aj Oif vertex is not in half plane Boundary Binary Parameters ssl, ss2, ss3, ss4 where ssj 1 if vertex is on boundary edge ssj 0 if vertex is not on boundary edge Given any candidate PLA primitive vertex Xy Yy and the incidence rectangle of a reference PLA primitive defined by XlR YlR . X2R Y2R then the half plane binary parameters can be determined as follows IF YV Y1R THEN alpha 1 1 ELSE 1 alpha 1 0 IF XV X2R THEN alpha 2 1 ELSE alpha 2 IF YV V2R THEN a3 1 ELSE a3 0 IF Xv 1R THEN alpha 4 1 ELSE a4 0 In a similar manner and utilizing the sane nonenclature, ttic boundary edge binary parameters can be determined as follows IF Yy Y1R THEN ssl 1 ELSE ssl 0 IF Xv X2R THEN ss2 1 ELSE ss2 0 IF YV Y2R THEN 1 ELSE ss3 0 IF Xv S1R THEN ss4 1 ELSE ss4 0 Given these binary parameters, a1, a2 a35 a4 and ss1, ss2, ss3, ss4 , the relationship between any candidate PLA primitive vertex Xv Yv and the incidence rectangle, associated with the reference PLA primitive and defined by the vertex pair XlR YlR , X2R Y2R , can be classified as follows CLASS I Interior Relationship By examining the previous diagram of the incidence rectangle, the interior relationship can be defined as follows I al alpha 2 a3 alpha 4 Therefore, if I 1, then the candidate PLA primitive vertex XVlY experiences an interior relationship with the reference PLA primitive defining the incidence rectangle whose vertex pair is XlRYlR , X2R Y2R . Conversely, if I 0, no interior relationship exists between the PLA primitive pair. CLASS II Boundary Relationship By examining the previous diagram of the incidence rectangle, the boundary relationship of the PLA primitive pair can be defined by the constituent edge properties as follows B ss1 alpha 2 alpha 4 ss2 alpha 1 alpha 3 ss3 alpha 2 alpha 4 ss4 alpha 1 alpha 3 Simplifying the above function, B alpha 1 alpha 3 ss2 ss4 alpha 2 alpha 4 ss1 ss3 Therefore, if B 1, then the candidate PLA primitive vertex X Yy experiences a boundary relationship with the reference PLA primitive defining the incidence rectangle whose vertex pair is XlR YlR , X2R Y2R . Conversely, if B 0, no boundary relationship exists between the PLA primitive pair.CLASS III Corner Relationship By examining the previous diagram of the incidence rectangle, the corner relationship of the PLA primitive pair can be defined by the constituent vertex properties as follows C sslss2 ss2ss3 ss3ss4 sslss4 Therefore, if C 1, then the candidate PLA primitive vertex Xv Yv experiences a corner relationship with the reference PLA primitive defining the incidence rectangle whose vertex pair is XlR YlR , X2R Y2R Conversely, if C 0, no corner relationship exists between the PLA primitive pair. Thus it can be seen that the binary parameters, I, B, C, completely characterize the PLA primitive pair relationships necessary to generate mask geometries for contiguous, cover, and protect situations. These binary parameters will also serve to effectively control algorithmic processing as they are ideally suited in formulating decision table structures. Primitive Relationships to Mask Geometries Mapping Up to this point, the discussion has attempted to quantify the global relationship between a pair of PLA primitives. The binary parameters I, B and C, as previously defined, served to quantify the relational situation. Now the local relationship between the candidatePLA vertex Xv Yg and the edges and vertices of the incidence rectangle related to the reference PLA primitive can be shown in FIG. 5. Where bl ssl a2 a4 c1 ssl b2 ss2 a1 a3 c2 ss2 ss3 b3 ss3 2 a2 alpha 4 C3 ss3 34 b4 ss4 alpha 1 a3 c4 ss1 34 and EMI23.1 j l j l The Boolean expressions in FIG. 5 define B and C and are in the conventional sum of products connonical form. It can be further seen that each b. is associated with an edge J of the incidence rectangle and each Cj is associated with a vertex of the incidence rectangle. These bj and cj binary parameters define the local edge vertex relationships existing between the PLA primitive pair. The algorithmic significance is that the b. and c. binary J J parameters imply spatial orientation of the PLA primitive pair and can be used in structuring the calculations associated with the mask geometries algorithm.The Contiguous Situation The contiguous situation is defined as being any PLA primitive pair that experiences an orthogonal relationship of X 0 or A 1 and both possessing the SIZE property. These situations can be generalized in FIG. 6a and 6b.Explicit A 03Implicit R 0 An important rule governs the remapping of the mutual edges of the PLA primitive pair experiencing the contiguous situation. If the mutual edges are unequal, the smaller sized edge is extended to or remapped on the larger sized edge to form a contiguous polygon. The various combinations of PLA primitive pairs and the resulting mask geometries are presented in FIG. 9 showing the table of mask geometries for contiguous situation.The Cover Situation The cover situation is defined as being any PLA primitive pair that experiences an orthogonal relationship of A 1 in which the reference PLA primitive possesses a SIZE property and the candidatePLA primitive possesses a COVER property. This situation can be generalized in FIG. 7. As shown in FIG. 7, the candidate PLA possesses the COVER property.Therefore, the mutual edge of the reference PLA primitive is experiencing a pushing or pulling effect inflicted by the candidatePLA. The degree of influence on the mutual edge is defined by theCOVER value. It should be noted that the COVER property only modifies the related edge geometries of the reference PLA primitive. The various combinations of PLA primitive pairs and the resulting mask geometries experiencing the COVER influence are presented in FIG. 10, showing the mask geometries for cover situation. The Protect Situation The protect situation is defined as being any PLA primitive pair that experiences a diagonal relationship of A 1 in both X and Y in which the reference PLA primitive possesses a SIZE property and the candidate PLA primitive possesses a PROTECT property. This situation can be generalized in Fl0. 8. As shown above, the candidate PLA possesses the PROTECT property.Therefore, the mutual vertex of the referenced PLA primitive is experiencing a pushing effect inflicted by the candidate PLA primitive.The degree of influence on the mutual vertex is defined by the PROTECT value. It should be noted that the PROTECT property only modifies the related vertex geometries of the referenced PLA primitive. The various combinations of PLA primitive pairs and the resulting mask geometries experiencing the PROTECT influence are presented in FIG. 11, showing the mask geometries for protect situation.The Mask Geometry Equation In transforming a PLA primitive into a rectangular mask geometry, an algorithmic procedure is utilized to map the edges defining the mask geometry. This transformation consists of two major requirements namely, spatial placement of the mask geometry and the sizing and shaping of the edges defining the boundary of the mask geometry as a function of the proximity environment Mask Geometry Placement Even though the device designer is completely isolated from placement coordinates in pCAD, the compueter software still uses coordinates in defining PLA primitives that have been mapped on the color graphics screen. Each vertex defining a point and each vertexpair defining a line or area is uniquely described as CXv Yv This can be visualized in FIG. 12. The absolute coordinates XA YA of a PLA primitive is simply the relative symbolic design coordinates Xv Yv multiplied by the scale factors Ax, By i.e., XA XXXV and Y, AyYV. The scale factors represent the maximal resolvable distance, expressed in micron units, common to the process geometrics. The relative coordinates Xv Yv and the absolute coordinates XA YA are referenced to the 0 0 point of the module represented by the set of PLA primitives.Mask Geometry Edge Mapping After mask geometry placement, the absolute vertex coordinates XA YA are used to map the edges defining the mask geometries. The four edges defining the mask geometries boundary of a particularPLA primitive are considered to be elastically bound. That is, each edge pair defines a boundary vertex. It is the placement of these vertices in the absolute coordinate domain that constitutes edge mapping. This can be illustrated in FIG. 13 as a continuation of the previous figures, As seen in FIG. 13 it is the vertex placement that defines the edge mapping. Hence, the boundary definition that constitutes the primary mask geometry is referred to as SIZE. Now the edge mapping can be further influenced by the immediately surrounding PLA primitives. These environmental or proximity influences are referred to as COVER and PROTECT. The COVER influences result in remapping edges that experience a pushing or pulling effect e.g., to provide an overlap geometry. The PROTECT influences result in remapping vertices that experience a pushing effect e.g., island reshaping. This edge mapping concept can by symbolically represented and referred to as the mask geometry equation MASK GEOMETRY SIZE COVER PROTECT The requisite data, as derived from the process geometrics, underlying the mask geometry equation will be discussed in Section 9.0 entitled Specifying Mask Geometries.The Mask Correction Factor Concept Any microelectronics fabrication process is periodically being subjected to fine tuning procedures all in the name of improving process yield and or device performance. One of the salient features of symbolic design is that mask sets can be quickly regenerated from the verified layout. The correction factor concept, as previously discussed above, provides the analytical measurement that isolates the designer from the geometrical details accompanying the fabrication stages of lithograp and processing. The correction factor for any particular mask layer is composed of many components and can be defined as follows Cm CAM AL AP Where AM represents corrections due to photo or e beam lithography and step and repeat distortions. AL represents corrections due to photo resist exposure distortions Ap represents corrections due to processing distortions associated with diffusion, implanting or evaporation techniques. represents corrections due to physical structure variations with regard to electrical performance. m represents the mask layer subscript. If Cm O, then the mask geometries will all be appropriately expanded, while if Cm O, then the mask geometries will all be appropriately shrunk. Thus it can be seen that Cm embodies all the corrections actually occurring between the symbolic design and the physical structures implementing the finished device. The analytical versatility of this concept, coupled with its inherent simplicity, provides a powerful means of modifying mask geometries that isolates the designer from fabrication details throughout the design synthesis and analysis methodology. Interactive Symbolic Circuit Analysis As discussed above, pCAD provides means for the synthesis and analysis of modules to be integrated into VLSI device designs.The pCAD system is specialized for the device designer to provide an interactive facility for manipulating layout primitives points, lines, areas in symbolically composing circuit topology on a color graphics display. This section discusses the mathematical and software aspects of an interactive circuit analysis technique. This circuit analysis technique is predicated on the concept that to develop high performance speed VLSI circuitry, it will be essential to model the interconnect influences directly from the color enhanced symbol layout together with the more conventional modeling of FET dynamics. To scale the circuit analysis problem so that it is implementable on an affordable minicomputer, a single circuit node formulation will be employed as opposed to the conventional circuit network formulation.This means that a single differential equation will describe the dynamics of sourcing charge into the node under analysis and the dynamics of sinking charge from the node under analysis. As process geometrics shrink to submicron dimensions and the assault toward increased switching speeds continues unabated, the modeling of physical structures becomes increasingly relevant. Thus circuit analysis must be derived from the symbolic layout of circuit topology to appropriately consider the parasitic influences exerted by proximity.The determination of stray or parasitic influences must be derived from 4 dimensional x,y,z,t electromagnetic field macromodels. The consideration of interconnect structure in the interactive circuit analysis methodology within MCAD is the innovative idea that will enable costeffective high speed VLSI circuit design. Interactive computer graphics techniques are utilized to allow the designer to easily express his desire to perform circuit analysis at any point in the synthesis process. The node under analysis is designated by locating the cursor on a graphic primitive defining the nodal topology. The designer is afforded the opportunity to define the a priori nodal performance budget under the design intent concept of rigorously defining design objectives prior to composing the symbolic layout. The nodal response is displayed to the designer as an e e trajectory with superimposed performance budget.This graphics presentation to the designer enables the designer to quickly judge design acceptability, or modification to FET drive capability or layout topology modification to reduce parasitic influence. Basic Assumptions Underlying UCAD Circuit Analysis In defining an alternative circuit analysis capability, the following itemized assumptions are assumed 1. the designer is primarily interested in very specific performance questions while evaluating candidate symbolic layouts a. how to interconnect active elements to create the required functional behavior b. how to size FETs to drive loads to realize the required performance. 2. the primary source of charge to any node and the primary sink of charge from any node is produced by a logically enabled conduction path to VDD and ground, respectively 3. incidental interactions with topologically adjacent nodes proximity is second order, each individually unspectacular, although the accumulation of interactions must be accurately accounted for 4. no one knows how to accurately model the conduction dynamics of FETs. However, the displacement current into a channel is assumed not to be a strong function of the source impedance. The same applies to non linear capacitive couplings 5. the worst case conditions influencing the node under analysis can be easily specified by the designer.Formulation of Circuit Analysis Within the CAD Design Environment Historically, circuit analysis has focused its attention on modeling a multiport circuit network. In the present invention, circuit analysis will be founded on a single node model. This proposed alternative conceptually represents a scaling of the circuit analysis problem that appears appropriate for interactive processing on a mini micro computer. This scaling also appears appropriate from the designers standpoint.Now the designer can concentrate on formulating the worst case conditions of sourcing charge into a node or sinking charge from a node in striving to satisfy performance budgets. The salient points underlying the circuit analysis formulation are the following 1. formulate a generalized model for any node in a VLSI network 2. as the symbolic layout is being interactively composed, accumulate, node by node, the incidence and extent of each proximity relationship which define specific couplings between conductive paths 3. solve the nonlinear ordinary differential equation ODE for only one node node under analysis . Use worst case approximations to represent whats happening elsewhere 4. extract an arbitrarily close straight line approximation to the ODE solution trajectory 5. store this ODE trajectory representation of each node in a data structure that provides rapid access for subsequent nodal analyses 6. display the ODE trajectory representation to the designer so he can quickly realize the consequences of any choice of layout topology.Superimpose the performance budgets to immediately compare the response of present circuit toplogy to design targets 7. provide for the evolution in device physics and process scaling by using multivariable functional relationships to describe the nonlinear conductance and capacitance characteristics of FETs, diodes and interconnect structures. Mask Geometries Algorithm The purpose of the mask geometries algorithm is to generate mask polygons from PLA primitives, and is illustrated in FIG. 17.Since the steps in the flow chart shown in FIG. 17 are readily apparent from the figure itself, a detailed explanation at this point is not necessary. Rectangle Polygon Algorithm The mask geometries algorithm transforms the PLA primitives into mask geometries that will be in the form of rectangles. When examining the proximity environment via primitive pairs, if a SIZE condition exists then the rectangle will be merged into the related polygon.The reasons for characterizing mask geometries in pCAD as polygons are as follows 1 a cleaner, less cluttered, color graphics display of a mask geometries window results since redundant edge segments are eliminated, 2 a compressed data format can be used to store rectilinear polygons, 3 mask geometries characterized as polygons simplifies the delayed correction factor C concept since concern over contiguousness is greatly reduced, 4 polygon decomposition algorithms can be independently optimized for photo lithography and e beam lithography processes, and 5 it affords an opportunity to develop a high level lithography data interface language that takes advantage of arraying and replication schemes utilized in VLSI device architectures. The rectangle to be merged into a related polygon can be envisioned in FIG. 15. This rectangle can further be characterized as consisting of a horizonal edge pair and a vertical edge pair. Each of these edge pairs can be defined as a coordinate 3 tuple, that is horizontal edges Y1, X1, X2 and Y2, X1, X2 vertical edges X1, Y1, Y2 and cox2, Y1, Y2 These coordinate 3 tuples will be used by the RECTANGLEPOLYGON algorithm.Now the related rectilinear polygon can be defined as a coordinate n tuple as follows X2 Y3 X4 rectilinear polygon X1, Y1 Yz , X3 , y4 Yn In sequencing through the coordinate n tuple string defining the polygon, the respective edges of the polygon can be sequentially defined as follows 1 V2 Y3 Y1 V2 V3 Edge No. 1 Y1 X1 X2 Horizonal X1 Y1 Y2 Vertical Edge No. 2 X2 Y1 Y3 Vertical Y2 X1 X3 Horizontal Edge No. 3 Y3 X2 X4 Horizontal X3 Y2 Y4 Vertical Edge No. 4 X4 Y3 Y5 Vertical Y4 X3 Xs Horizontal Where V1, V2, V3 is the coordinate 3 tuple defining the horizontal and vertical edges of the polygon. The relationships existing between the rectangle and the polygon can be classified as follows in FIG. T6a, b, c, d, and e. FIG. 16a and 16b show 3 vertices to be added to polygon, 1 vertex to be deleted from polygon. FIG. 16c shows 2 vertices to be added to polygon, 2 vertices to be deleted from polygon. FIG. 16d and 16e shows 4 vertices to be added to polygon. The RECTANGLE POLYGON Algorithm can now be defined in FIG. 17 which utilizes the nomenclature presented in this section. Rectangle Polygon Algorithm The rectangle polygon algorithm flow chart is shown inFIG. 17, and is believed self explanatory. Specifying Mask Geometries Up to this point in the discussion, the algorithmic aspects underlying pCAD mask geometries has been presented in a generalized manner. The intent was to demonstrate the versatility of the mask geometries algorithm and its generalization due to the mathematical concepts utilized. In this section, a language is proposed that will enable the mathematical variables to receive values relating to a given fabrication process. This set of statements resides on floppy disk in a repository referred to as the Process Library.It will enable the design community to design several modules, in a given process, to be decoupled from the analytical details accompanying the specification of mask geometriesLanguage Definition Upper case letters represent constants in the language while lower case letters represent language variables which the designer must quantify. Scale x scale y scal e Mask mask name mask number , mask correction factor display color Size Cover number design color design symbol 3, Protect Where the variables of the mask geometries language can take on the following values display color color design color color color R G Y B M C W Where R means red G means green Y means yellow B means blue M means magenta C means cyan W means white design symbol 0 X Where 0 means FET X means contact The mask geometries language consists of only five statements in which the SIZE, COVER, and PROTECT statements are collected and preceded by a MASK statement. For an experimental CMOS SOS process, the poly silicon mask would be simply specified as follows SCALE 4.5 4.5 MASK POLY 110, 8 cry SIZE 1 GO, BO, CO 1 2 RX Note that the numerical values sizing the PLA primitives are given in nominal 1X values from the grid centerline in units of microns. Numerical values may be integer 3 or real 4.15 .An Example The Problem of 4 Adjacent Points with Unequal Sizes The 4 adjacent points problem has been a rather troublesome problem to the conventional mask geometries algorithm. Consequently, this has become a classical problem with regard to mask geometry contiguousness in symbolic design. It can be defined in FIG. 18a, b, c, d, and e. This example also illustrates the inherent advantage incorporated into the mask geometries algorithm with regard to color graphics displaying. All the common edges of the rectangles within the polygon are deleted. This greatly enhances the color graphics display of mask geometries to the designer and facilities electronic measuring of intra and inter mask geometry spacings. The present invention presents the paramount concepts and algorithsm underlying the pCAD mask geometries capabilities. It is an interactive means available to device, lithography and process engineers to explore mask geometry design, The mask geometries are derived from the PLA primitives defining the symbolic design of a VLSI module.A very simple language is used to specify the SIZE, COVER and PROTECT data related to any specific process. However, in designing symbolic modules, the device designer is not required to specify these data since it resides within the Process Library. In the pCAD interactive design environment, the designer remains insulated from the details associated with mask geometries. In synthesizing the module design the designer utilizes the PLA primitives to compose the symbolic design on a color graphics screen. But at any point in the synthesis process, if the designer wishes ta explore mask geometries, he can conveniently do so. This feature has not been available in conventional CAD methodology until later in the design cycle. As process geometrics continue to shrink toward submicron levels, the ability to examine mask geometries via color graphics displays will be the only cost effective means available. This will eliminate the need for conventional color guides, as well as colored pencils and mylar layout schematics. The global strategy being suggested to provide technical versatility and cost effectiveness in mask generation for VLSI devices can be portrayed in FIG. 19. Algorithm A1 symbolic design primitives to mask rectanglesAlgorithm A2 mask rectangles to mask polygonsAlgorithm A3 design assembler with optional delayed correction factor modificationAlgorithm A4 photo lithography polygon fracturingAlgorithm AS e beam lithography polygon fracturing Module Level Logic Simulation pCAD A completely new approach to logic simulation is proposed to support synthesis activities at the module level. The purpose of module level logic simulation is to check the consistency of partially defined layout structures by a comparison with the functional specifications received from mCAD. The models to be exercised will be derived from the symbolic layout.This means that the logic simulation activities are performed concurrently with the layout design activities, hence, the need to develop a powerful interactive logic simulation capability. The emphasis must be placed on a simple means of initializing nodes and identifying nodes whose logic response transitions are to be displayed for analysis. This interactive logic simulation concept is also intended to support evaluation of candidate testability implementations which will become an integral part of the layout design problem.This means a powerful local simulation capability of time stepping the model to study stimuli response relationships during test mode operations.Interactive Symbolic Circuit Analysis There are two important technology trends that must be recognized when developing a circuit analysis methodology. First, as process geometrics continue to decrease, parasitic influences tend to become first order effects with increases in switching speeds. Secondly, FET schematics are abstractions and do not reflect the distributed physical structures in the silicon or sapphire device. Hence, derivation of the equivalent circuit and the determination of parameter values should come from the symbolic layout design. The data structure supporting the color graphics display functions can be transformed into a graph data structure defining the topological properties of the symbolic layout. This graph structure will essentially define the equivalent circuit to be analyzed. The vertices of the graph structure will represent equipotential nodes while the edges of the graph structure will represent the electrical dynamic characteristics of passive elements capacitors, resistors , and active elements diodes,FETs . An electrical transfornation language will be developed which will relate passive and active element parameters to the symbolic design entities points, lines, area used by the designer. This language concept is similar to the mask geometries transformation language MANN4 that has been used for many years. Macro FET models must be developed which greatly reduce the functional model dimensionality over the conventional circuit analysis models existing today.Techniques must be developed that allow the designer to easily specify initial conditions and identify nodes whose transient responses are to be displayed. The power of being able to perform circuit analysis evaluations, at any time a designer deems it profitable, is an extremely exciting concept. As performance trends toward developing higher speed logic, the need for equivalent circuits with greater fidelity becomes mandatory. It is essential that circuit analysis from the symbolic layout be recognized as a fundamental technical objective requiring allocation of significant resources.Interactive symbolic Geometry Checking Symbolic design enjoys a lower cost FET ratio than any other CAD methodology at a small sacrifice in area FET ratio. However, experience has indicated that symbolic design provides the designer with a conceptual, short hand method for easily manipulating circuit topology without the need to think simultaneously about mask and process details. These process details are invisible to the designer because of the powerful mask geometries algorithm which transforms symbolic layout designs into mask geometries. Symbolic design can improve the area FET ratio when used to create and compare candidate layouts for an equivalent function. Thus, symbolic design is a very effective design methodology. Forbidden proximity relationships are detected by an exhaustive scan of the symbol environment. The neighborhood of a symbol, placed at grid point, i,j , is shown below i 2 . . . i l . . . rows 1 S Sij i l . . . i 2 . . . j 2 j l j j l j 2 columns Layout Symbol Environment for Geometry Checking Symbolic geometry checking consists of verifying that processdependent patterns of symbols are not to be found in the neighborhood of the symbol Sjj. The symbolic geometry checking algorithm simply performs a two dimensional interaction over the entire symbolic layout of the device design. For M symbolic geometry checks to verify intra and inter layer process geometries, this means M Xmax total geometry checks must be performed for a symbolic layout size ofXmax by YmaX, where Xmax, Ymax 1500. This problem dimensionality must be contrasted against the conventional polygonal mask layer approach to appreciate the cost advantage.In the conventional approach, intramask and intermask polygonal geometries are conjunctioned and disjunctioned to determine violations in mask geometries and edge pair spacings. If we assume N polygons per mask layer and M mask layers per device, the number of polygonal geometry checks will exceed M N N 1 2. Since N 105 for VLSI devices, the number of polygonal geometry checks to be performed is exceedingly large 1010 . This dimensionality obviously nullifies the effectiveness of this concept for VLSI devices. In the pCAD concept, symbolic geometry checking will be a derivative of the conventional symbolic geometry checking previously discussed.Since the symbolic layout on the color graphics display is represented as an ordered point line area list, the symbolic geometry checking algorithm will involve a limited scan of this list. These symbolic geometry checks fundamentally involve point line, point area, and line area relationships. The dimensionality of this concept is approximately CpL CpA CLA 2 where Cij is the number of combinations between i and j. This dimensionality is considerably less than what is presently being experienced with our conventional symbolic geometry checking concepts. The advantage noted in symbolic geometry checking makes it essential that symbolic geometry checking be integrated into the new symbolic design methodology. As the design directives are being supplied to the software for appropriate color graphics displaying, they must be concurrently checked for any geometry violations. This means that these ground rule violations are being detected as the symbolic layout is being synthesized. In present design environments, these ground rule violations are being detected in a post layoutdigitizing activity. To implement the necessary layout alterations generally results in pertubating the layout in such a manner as to decrease FET density. This reduction in spatial optimization, plus the added design costs of implementing the layout changes, has an impact on device performance, buildability characteristics and ultimately costs.Concurrent symbolic geometry checking with interactive symbolic layout design overcomes these existing deficiencies.Color Enhanced Symbolic Design Symbolic design concepts are important features. The black and white 2 color multisymbol printed schematic, characterizing a microelectronic device design, has served a variety of device applications and processes since the 1960 s in a technically and economically effective manner. However, in the present invention, CAD captures the added dimensionality that color can provide in all aspects of device design.The introduction of color simplifies the representation of device design.
