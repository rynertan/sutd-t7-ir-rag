# Motion transmitting device.

## Abstract
A motion transmitting device of the quadrant drive type has a wheel 6 , preferably toothed, a plurality of independently movable elements 8 for successively engaging the wheel, a datum member 1 and an ec centric 3 effecting eccentric relative motion between the wheel 6 and the datum member 1 . Connector pins 12 movable in ovoid or circular holes 11, 12 in the wheel 6 and datum 1 guide the movable elements 8 into and out of engagement with the wheel 6 . The movable elements 8 are not linked, as in a chain, but means such as the use of two pins 12 per element 8 are provided to prevent the elements 8 from any tilting or having substantial rotation with respect to the datum member s . Other means of preventing tilting are de scribed. This construction in particular facilitates obtain ing high speed or torque ratios with high efficiency.
