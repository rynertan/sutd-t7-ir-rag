## Description
FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention pertains to an aromatic pitch containing a high liquid crystal optically active fraction, and more particularly to a pitch which can be directly spun into carbon fibers.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION As is well known, the catalytic conversion of virgin gas oils containing aromatic, naphthenic and paraffinic molecules results in the formation of a variety of distillates that have ever increasing utility and importance in the petrochemical indllstry. The economic and utilitarian value, however, of the residual fractions of the cat cracking processes also known as cat cracker bottoms has not increased to the same extent as have the light overhead fractions. One potential use for such cat cracker bottoms is in the manufacture of carbon artifacts. As is well known, carbon artifacts have been made by pyrolyzing a wide variety of organic materials. Indeed, one carbon artifact of particularly important commercial interest is carbon fiber. Hence, particular reference is made herein to carbon fiber technology.Nevertheless, it should be appreciated that this invention has applicability to carbon artifacts in a general sense, with emphasis upon the production on shaped carbon articles in the form of filaments, yarns, films, ribbons, sheets, etc. The use of carbon fibers for reinforcing plastic and metal matrices has gained considerable commercial acceptance. The exceptional properties of these reinforcing composite materials, such as their high strength to weight ratio, clearly offset their high preparation costs. It is generally accepted that large scale use of carbon fibers as reinforcing material would gain even greater acceptance in the marketplace, if the costs of the fibers could be substantially reduced.Thus, the formation of carbon fibers from relatively inexpensive carbonaceous pitches has received considerable attention in recent years. Many materials containing polycondensed aromatic can be converted at early stages of carbonization to z structurally ordered optically anisotropic spherical liquid crystal called mesophase. The presence of this ordered structure prior to carbonization is considered to be fundamental in obtaining a high quality carbon fiber Thus, one of the first requirements of a feedstock material suitable for carbon fiber production, is its ability to be converted to a highly optically anisotropic material. fn addition, suitable feedstocks for carbon artifact manufacture, and in particular carbon fiber manufacture, should have relatively low softening points and sufficient viscosity suitable for shaping and spinning into desirable articles and fibers. Unfortunately, many carbonaceous pitches have relatively high softening points indeed, incipient coking frequently occurs in such materials at temperatures where they have sufficient viscosity for spinning.The presence of coke, infusible materials, and or high softening point components, are detrimental to the fiber making process. Thus, for example, U.S. Patent 3,919,376 discloses the difficulty in deforming pitches which undergo coking and or polymerization at the softening temperature of the pitch. Another important characteristic of the feedstock for carbon artifact manufacture is its rate of conversion to a suitable optically anisotropic material.For example, in the above mentioned U.S. patent, it is disclosed that 350oC is the minimum temperature generally required to produce me so phase from a carbonaceous pitch. More importantly, however, is the fact that at least one week of heating is necessary to produce a mesophase content of about 40 , at that minimum temperature. Mesophase, of courses can be generated in shorter times by heating at higher temperatures.However, as indicated above, incipient coking and other undesirable side reactions take place at temperatures in excess of about 4400C. In U.S. Patent 4,208,267, it has been disclosed that typical graphitized carbonaceous pitches contain a separable fraction which has important physical and chemical properties. Indeed, this separable fraction exhibits a softening range and viscosity suitable for spinning. It also has the ability to be converted rapidly at temperatures in the range generally of about 230oC to about 400oC to an optically anisotropic, deformable, liquid crystalline material structure.Unfortunately, the amount of separable fraction present in well known commercially available petroleum pitches, such as Ashland 240 and Ashland 260, to mention a few, is exceedingly low. For example, with Ashland 240, no more than about 10 of the pitch constitutes a separable fraction capable of being thermally converted to a deformable anisotropic phase. In U.S. Patent 4,184,942, it has been disclosed that the amount of the aforementioned fraction yielding an optical anisotropic pitch can be increased by heat soaking the feedstock at temperatures in the range of 3500C to 4500C, until spherules visible under polarized light begin to appear. In U.S. Patent 4,219,404, it has been disclosed that the polycondensed aromatic oils present isotropic graphitizable pitches are generally detrimental to the rate of formation of highly anisotropic material in such feedstocks when they are heated at elevated temperatures and that, in preparing a feedstock for carbon artifact manufacture, it is particularly advantageous to remove at least a portion of the polycondensed aromatic oils normally present in the pitch simultaneously with, or prior to, heat soaking of the pitch for converting it into a feedstock suitable in carbon artifact manufacture. More recently, in U.S. Patent 4,271,006 June 2, 1981 , a process has been disclosed for converting cat cracker bottoms to a feedstock suitable in carbon artifact manufacture. Basically, the process requires stripping cat cracker bottoms of fractions boiling below 4000C and thereafter heat soaking the residue followed by vacuum stripping to provide a carbonaceous aromatic pitch Cat cracker bottoms like all other heavy aromatic residues obtained from steam cracking, fluid cracking or coal processing are composed of two components 1 a low molecular weight oil fraction which can be distilled and 2 an undistillable fraction of high molecular weight. This high molecular weight fraction is insoluble in paraffinic solvents such as n heptane, iso octane, pet ether, etc. This fraction is generally called wasphaltene . It is preferred to use an asphaltene free feed for the production of pitches. These asphaltenes have a very high molecular weight up to 10,000 , a very high coking characteristic coking value as high as 67.5 wt coke yield at 5500C , and a very high melting point 200 2500C . It is desired to use an asphaltene free cat cracker bottom. The asphaltene free cat cracker bottom is free of ash, coke particles and other impurities.The absence of asphaltene, ash, coke particles and other organic and inorganic impurities make the cat cracker bottom distillate an ideal feed for the production of an aromatic pitch with a very high .content of liquid crystals. This asphaltene free cat cracker bottom can be prepared by two methods a by a distillation process e.g., vacuum or steam distillation and b by deasphaltenation of the cat cracker bottom. The deasphaltenation can be made readily by solvent extraction with a paraffinic solvent. In U.S. Patent No. 4,363,715 a process is described for obtaining a feedstock with a low liquid crystal fraction by heat soaking a distillate derived from a cat cracker bottom. The pitch produced in the above patent No. 4,363,715 cannot be used directly for carbon fiber production. The liquid crystal fraction has to be extracted from the pitch and used for fiber production. Whereas, U.S. Patent No. 4,363,715 teaches that all of the cat cracker bottoms can be used to obtain a pitch having low toluene insolubles Ti , the present invention teaches the opposite, i.e. obtaining a pitch from fractions of the cat cracker bottoms which has a high Ti content a high content of liquid crystals The present i nvention uses deasphaltenated feed stock fractions to provide a pitch having a high Ti content, and one which does not require Ti solvent extraction prior to spinning into fibers. The deasphaltenated fractions of a feed stock in accordance with this invention is generally free of ash and impurities, and has the proper rheological properties to allow direct spinning into carbon fibers.The pitch obtained from this fraction produces fibers which have high strength and performance. For example, a deasphaltenated cat cracker bottom fraction obtained in accordance with the present invention, has virtually no coking value at 5500C compared with a 56 standard coking value for Ashland 240. The deasphaltenated cat cracker bottom fraction is composed of 4, 5, and 6 polycondensed aromatic rings. This provides a uniform feed material which can be carefully controlled to produce a uniform product with a narrow molecular weight distribution.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention pertains to a high Ti pitch for direct spinning into carbon fibers. An aromatic pitch with a very high liquid crystal fraction 80 100 can be prepared by thermally reacting a deasphaltenated fraction of either a cat cracker bottom, steam cracker tar or a coal distillate, that are respectively rich in 4, 5 and 6 2, 3, 4 and 5 and 3, 4, 5 and 6 aromatic rings. The various feedstocks fraction are heat soaked in a temperature range from 4200C to 4500C at atmospheric pressure, and then vacuum stripped to remove at least a portion of the unreacted oils at a temperature in the approximate range of from 3200C to 4400C at 0.1 to 100 mmHg, and preferably at greater than 4000C at 1.0 5.0 mmHg of pressure. More specifically, in the case of cat cracker bottoms the fraction is heat soaked at approximately 4400C for 2 4 hours at atmospheric pressure. In the case of steam cracker tars, the fraction is heat soaked at 4300C for approximately 4.0 hours and in the case of coal distillate, the fraction is heat soaked at approximately 4400C for 1 4 to 1 2 hour. All the heat soaked materials are then vacuum stripped and spun directly into carbon fibers. The pitch of this invention is definable only in terms of deasphaltenated fractions of a feedstock and containing 4, 5 and 6 aromatic rings. For the purposes of definition the terms deasphaltenated feedstock and or deasphaltenated middle fraction of a feedstock shall mean a deasphaltenated material obtained from a middle cut of a feedstock, and or one caused to be relatively free of asphaltenes by means of obtaining a distillate portion of said feedstock which when further treated will form a precursor which can be spun into a carbon fiber and which has the following general characteristics 1 a relatively low coking value 2 a relatively low content of ash and impurities and 3 a relatively narrow average molecular weight range. 4 consisting of 3, 4, 5 and 6 alkyl substituted polycondensed aromatics. A typical weight percentage of asphaltenes in a deasphaltenated cat cracker bottom feedstock being in the range of approximately 0.0 to 1.0 . A directly spinnable pitch of this invention has the proper rheological properties characterized as a glass transition temperature Tg in the approximate range of 1800C to 2500C at atmospheric pressure, and or a viscosity of less than approximately 2,500 cps in a temperature of approximately 3600C at atmospheric pressure. It is an object of this invention to provide an improved pitch which can be directly spun into carbon fibers. It is another object of the invention to provide a pitch for manufacturing carbon fibers which is more uniform, and which is relatively free of ash and impurities. It is a further object of this invention to provide a pitch having high toluene insolubles, and which does not require Ti solvent extraction prior to spinning into fibers. These and other objects of this invention will be better understood and will become more apparent with reference to the following detailed description considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 is a graphical representation of deasphaltenated fractions of various feedstocks used to provide the inventive pitches for direct spinning into carbon fibers, including the deasphaltenated cat cracker bottom of this invention. Figure 2 shows a graph of viscosity vs.temperature for a number of pitches made from deasphaltenated cat cracker bottom distillates and Figure 3 depicts a graph of a glass transition temperature scan for one of the pitches shown in Figure 2. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The term catalytic cracking refers to a thermal and catalytic conversion of gas oils, particularly virgin gas oils, boiling generally between 3160C and 5660C, into lighter, more valuable products. Cat cracker bottoms refer to that fraction of the product of the cat cracking process which boils in the range of from about 2000C to about 5500C. Cat cracker bottoms typically have relatively low aromaticity as compared with graphitizable isotropic carbonaceous pitches suitable in carbon artifact manufacture.

Basically, the cat cracker bottom is separated into at least a single distillate having a boiling point at 760 mm mercury in the range of from about 2500C to about 5300C, and the residue being the fraction not distillable at temperatures up to 5300C, at a pressure of about 350 to 450 millimeters of mercury.In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, the distillate fraction of the cat cracking bottom which is employed in forming a suitable carbonaceous pitch for carbon artifact manufacture is that fraction boiling in the approximate range of about 4 500C to about 510oC at 760 mm of mercury. The desired cat cracker bottom fraction can also be obtained by other commercially known separation methods such as steam distillation, flash stripping or by using a thin film evaporator. To produce a pitch with a high fraction of anisotropic liquid crystal, the cat cracker bottom fraction is heat soaked at temperatures in the approximate range of 4200C to 4500C at atmospheric pressure.In general, heat soaking is conducted for times ranging from 2 hours to about 4 hours. In the practice of the present invention, it is particularly preferred that heat soak ing be done in an atmosphere such as nitrogen, or alternatively in a hydrogen atmosphere. When the heat soaking is completed, the reaction mixture is then subjected to a reduced pressure at a liquid temperature between 3204400C, and most prefer ably at 400 4300C, to remove from the mixture at least part of the distillable unreacted oils. Prefer ably, all of the unreacted oils are removed in order to concentrate and increase the anisotropic liquid crystal fraction in the final pitch product. The use of a high liquid temperature, e.g., 400 4300C, is very desirable.The high liquid temperature helps to remove the distillable unreacted oils, which if left in the final pitch product tend to dilute and reduce the liquid crystal content of the pitch. Optionally, the heat soaked mixture can be purged with a gas such as nitrogen in order to accelerate the removal of the unreacted oils. The resultant pitch produced by the abovedescribed method has a low melting point as defined by our DSC method 190 2300C , has very high aromaticity 85 90 of aromatic carbon atoms by carbon NMR method and contains a high anisotropic liquid crystal fraction 80 100 by polarized light microscopy . The pitch composition is defined readily by using solvent analysis, wherein the content insolubles in toluene at room temperature a nd the content insolubles in quinoline at 750C are determined. The toluene insoluble Ti fraction in the pitch can be used to give a measure of the liquid crystal content in the pitch. One of the objectives of this invention is to transform the cat cracker bottom distillate fraction into a pitch with a very high content of toleune insolubles 80 100 , and which can b spun directly into carbon fibers, as shown in Figure 1. The e p pitch of this invention IS def inable in terms of deasphaltenated fractions of a feedstock Figures 1 Table 4 below, summarizes the heat soaking conditions for a variety of deasphaltenated feedstocks, and the resultant characteristics of each pitch Table 4The Production of Directly Spinnable pitch from Distillates of CCB, SCT and CoalSCT COALFEED CCB DISTILLATE DISTILLATE DISTILLATEExample 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9Heat Soaking Process ConditionsTemp C 440 440 440 450 440 430 430 430 440Time hrs 2 3 4 2 3 1 2 40 40 40 1 4Pressute atmospherePitch CompositionTiSop 84.5 86.8 91.7 89.9 94.4 86.0 89.1 97.0 97.5QiASTM 17.3 25.4 45.9 27.1 32.4 0.4 32.8 14.0 1.7RPI 39.1 50.0 49.9 66.0 Glass Transition Temp C of total pitch 194 219 228 214 207 193 183 of TiSep 235 235 244 239 242 245 210 Elemental analysisCarbon 93.99 93.48 92.89 89.88 Hydrogen 4.32 4.09 4.14 5.37 Sufur 1.5 0.41 Oxygen 2.91 Nitrogen 1.59 Table 4 ContinuedThe Production of Directly Spinnable pitch from Distillates of CCB, SCT and CoalSCT COALFEED CCB DISTILLATE DISTILLATE DISTILLATEExample 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9AromaticityAromatic carbon atom 88 C H atomic ratio 1.80 1.90 1.87 1.59 Viscosity cps 310 C 1393 320 C 400 330 C 131 435 5229 340 C 4352 218 1523 350 C 1409 696 The rehology of pitches used for direct spinning is of great importance to obtain good spinnability. It is desired to have pitches with low viscosity at the spinning temperature which is preferrably below around 4000C, in order to avoid pitch cracking and volatilization which could lead to serious foaming of the fiber and substantial reduction in the fiber strength.The pitch for direct spinning is also desired to be less sensitive to heat, i.e. does not change its viscosity too much when changing temperature, The sensitivity of the pitch to temperature variation can be determined from viscosity temperature curves. This relationship for several pitches designated A, B, C, andD is shown in Figure 2 Differential Scanning Calorimetry DSC is used to obtain information on glass transition and softening characteristics of pitches. An OMINITHERM Corp. DSC Model QC25 is used to obtain the glass transition Tg data.The method comprises heating a small sample of the pitch in the DSC pan, allowed to cool and the DSC trace was then obtained by heating at the rate of 100C min under nitrogen 30cc min , From the DSC trace three DSC data points are determined the onset of Tg Ti , the termination of Tg Tf and the Tg point which is at the midway between the Ti and Tf point. It has been reported that there is a relationship between the Tg of the pitch and its softening point as determined by the traditional method such as the ring and ball method. The softening point is higher by around 600C than the Tg.
