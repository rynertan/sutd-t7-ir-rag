# Thin transparent polytetrafluoroethylene film and production process thereof.

## Abstract
Disclosed herein is a thin transparent polytetrafluoroethy lene film defined as follows 1 a film thickness of 0.1 100 µm 2 a parallel light transmittance of at least 70 as mea sured in accordance with JIS K 7105 and 3 a tensile strength of at least 1 kg mm² as measured in accordance with JIS K 6887 except for the use of a pulling speed of 10 mm min. . It is produced by fluorinating with a fluorine gas a thin film formed from a solution of a fluoroethylene polymer having an inherent viscosity of at least 2.5 dl g as measured at a temper ature of 30 C and a solution concentration of 0.4 g dl in ac cordance with the casting process and having a thickness of 0.1 100µm.
