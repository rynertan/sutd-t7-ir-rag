## Description
The invention concerns an attach device to be used when attaching of an essentially vertical guide for a submersible mixer or pump in a liquid tank. Mixers are often used in liquid tanks containing amounts of solid bodies to prevent sedimentation and to keep the liquid homogeneous. A type of mixer often used today is a submersible machine comprising an electric motor, which may be provided with a gearbox, and an impeller. The machine is then normally arranged to be lowered along a vertical guide which is attached within the tank in a suitable way. The advantage of such a machine is above all, that it may be easily taken up for service and in addition it is very easy to adjust in various directions. The central and important part in the plant is, in addition to the mixer itself, the guide used to lower the machine down to its operating position. The guide must be easy to attach in tanks already used. It is also important that the attach devices will not be an obstacle when the machine is moved along the guide. A guide attachment of this type is shown in EP A 107 406. However, this device is not suitable for attaching to horizontal or sloping surfaces. In order to obtain a non expensive solution, the same type of device should be used for all types of surfaces and additionally, the attach means must be so designed that the guide is allowed to be rotated in both directions. This rotation is necessary to make possible various directions of the mixer and the guide must also be turned when the mixer shall be lifted and taken away from the tank. These problems are solved by the device according to the subsequent claims. The invention is described more closely below with reference to the enclosed drawing. In the drawing 1 stands for an attach plate having fastening lugs 2, 3 is an intermediate part, 4 a sleeve, 5 a socket, 6 a part of a guide and 7 a mixer. The attach plate 1 is thus possible to attach to a horizontal surface such as the bottom of the tank, a vertical surface such as the tank wall or a sloping surface such as a transition between the bottom and the wall. The intermediate part 3 is pivotally attached to the lugs 2 and is directed in a suitable angle depending on the inclination of the plane to which the plate 1 is attached. The socket 5 is in its turn rotatably carried by the intermediate part 3, thus making possible a rotation of the guide 6 with the socket 5 and the intermediate part 3 as the center of rotation. The attach device has thus such abilities that it, without any changes, may be used on all surfaces, independent of their inclinations. In addition, a rotation of the guide 6 is possible where the center of rotation is situated beside the guide and finally the attach devices are so designed that they form no obstacles when the mixer is brought along the guide on its glides. The last point is very important in deep tanks as the guide then must be attached at several points on the tank wall.
