# Multiple bit encoding technique for combinational multipliers.

## Abstract
A four member encoding set is disclosed which allows the construction of combinational monolithic multipliers with a sig nificant reduction in the number of devices required. The reduced device and wire count in the present technique allows a multiplier circuit of any given size to be made less expensively or alterna tively allows a larger precision multiplier to be constructed.
