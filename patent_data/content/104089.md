# Simultaneous formation and deposition of multiple ribbon like streams.

## Abstract
At least one ribbon like stream 44, 78, 83 of a first coating composition adjacent to and in edge contact with at least one second ribbon like stream 46, 79, 84 of a second coating composition are deposited on the surface 102, 112, 122, 146 of a support member 104, 114, 124, 148 by establishing relative motion between the surface of the support member and the ribbon like streams, simultaneous ly constraining and forming the ribbon like streams parallel to and closely spaced from each other, contacting adjacent edgas of the ribbon like streams prior to applying the ribbon like streams to the surface of the support member and thereafter applying the ribbon like streams to the surface of the support member.
