## Description
Description of the invention entitled Covering system with sheet for lorries in the name of Are 116 CRAXERO at Arimis, Udine Province submitted on under No. This invention concerns a new covering system for lorries.To be more specific, this invention concerns a covering system with a sheet, whereby the system is suitable for certain vehicles such as, for instance, tipper lorries or the like which can often be used to carry aggregate such as sand, rocks, gravel and wooden or metal chips, and so on. The use of a sheet to cover lorries has always been deemed to be suitable for reducing pollution of the environ gent and lessening the risks for vehicles which may be follow leg. The realization of a covering system with a sheet must fulfil certain basic requirements if it is to be effective. First of all, the covering system should be easy to instal on normal lorry bodies without any necessity to apply modifications to the bodies already In existence. Moreover, the covering system should be simple and, therefore, economical to make and should perform its basic functions highly efficiently. In other words the covering system should not be readily damaged either by the material carried in the lorry or by the means that load said material, especially where loading takes place at the side of the lorry. A further requirement for a good cover is the ability to fold or open up the sheet from a distance. Arotwithstanding the fact that the aforesaid requirements are known, the devices known at present do not meet all the requirements in question. Normally, if one requirement is met, the outcome is that the other needs are not fulfilled. For instance, the known systems make use of runways or rails fitted to the walls of the vehicle body. Said runways often undergo damage or are too heavy and therefore hard to instal. An object of the present invention is to eliminate the shortcomings in the known covering systems with sheets and to meet the foregoing requirements in a more efficacious way than the known systems. This invention.overcomes the aforesaid problems by avo td ing the use of the conventional runways of the known art. In other words this invention utili es the same means both to move the sheet and also at the same time to guide the edges of said sheet so as to keep said edges in the right position in respect of the vehicle body. According to this invention a covering system with a sheet is envisaged in particular for vehicles which have a body with two side walls and one crosswise wall at its front, such as tipper lorries or the like. The system of this invention belongs to the known type that comprises a plurality of bars which uphold the sheet and are positioned across the body, whereby, to open or fold the sheet, it is enough to move the main bar respectively backwards or forwards along the walls of the body. The guide means suitable for keeping the bars near the respective edges of the upright walls and the means to move jhe bars consist of flexible means, such as wires, pre arranged generally parallel to each other along the upper edge of each lengthwise wall. The main crosswise bar is envisaged with fixture means to secure said bar to the flexible means. The intermediate tars, on the other hand, are envisaged to have means suitable or facilitating the sliding of said bars on said flexible means. The aforesaid flexible means are connected to means suitable for pulling the flexible means along the upper edges of the body. This invention, therefore, concerns a new cover ing system with a sheet which is not only highly resistant while it is being used, but is at the same time comparatively simple and therefore economical to make. Moreover, the object of the invention can be readily fitted to existing bodies without substantial modifications. be shall describe hereafter, as an example, a realiza tion of this invention and also a variant by making references to the attached tables, wherein Fig. I is a three quartem view of a body wherein the bars and, therefore, the sheet are generally disposed on the same plane as the top of the body Fig. 2 is a diagrammatic view from above of Fig.I Fig. 3 is a diagrammatic side view of Fig. I Fig. 4 is a detail of the part IV of Fig. 2 Fig. 5 is a detail of a part of the realization of Fig.I Fig. 6 is a partial three quarters view of a variant of Fig. I Fig. 7 is a diagrammatic representation like Fig. 5 but shows the realization of Fig. 6. The covering system with a sheet illustrated in the drawings is applied to a body I which has two side walls 2 3 and an end wall 4. A A plurality of bars 5 6 is visualized to uphold the flex ible sheet 7. The group of bars 5 6 comprises a main bar 5 and a plu reality of intermediate bars 6.The sheet 7 is anchored to the bars 5 6 with any suit . able means. Furthermore, the bars 5 6 stretch across the body and are pre disposed to slide along the upper edges of said body 1 in the direction A Fig. 2 so as to fold or open said sheet 7. This invention comprises guide means to keep the ends of the bars near the respective upper edges of the side walls 2 3 Fig. 4 shows an upper edge 8. The guide means consist of flexible wires 9 IO, as in Fig. 4. The wire I0.is pre disposed along the edge 8 and is. substantially parallel thereto. It can be seen in Fig. 5 that the main bar 5 is envisaged to have a through hole II within which the wire 10 passes.Said hole II is flattened at Ila to enable the end of the bar 5 to be fixed to a first part of the respective wires 9 IO. As can be seen in Fig. 5, the intermediate bars 6 have at each of their ends an eyelet I2 within which the relative wire 9 IO runs, so that the bars 6 can slide along the wires 9 IO. Each of the wires 9 IO is connected to pulling means which are pre arranged to draw the wire along the upper edge .8 of the relative wall 2 3 the part of the wire which runs through the eyelet 12 will be called hereinafter the second part of the flexible means. Fig. 4 shows clearly that the length of the bars 5 6 is dimensioned in such a way that the ends I3 of the bars 6 rest on the edges of the side walls 8 of the body. The pulling means consist of pulleys 14 15 and rear pulleys 16 I 7, whereby said front and rear pulleys are con . nected to the endless wires 9 10. The pulleys 14 17 are an . chored to the upper part of the respective side walls 2 3 by means of the supports 1821. The pulleys I4 I5 Fig. 2 are integral with the axle Z2 and therefore have a common rotation. tith the left end of said axle 22 is integral another pulley 23, which is con necked by the chain 24 to another pulley 25, which is equip ped with a crank 22 that serves for the rotation of said pulley 25 by hand. It should be noted that the pulling system can be moto rt ed. The second pulley 25 is envisaged as having a regula ting means not shown for the tension of the chain 24. Fig. 2 shows a variant wherein the sheet 7 comprises two side edges 27 28 generally in line with the inner ends of the upper edges 8 of the respective walls 2 3 so as to cover the whole width of the body and also to enable the sheet to be folded between the side walls. The sheet 7 is provided at Its ends 27 28 with connected ors 29 shaped like a closed S said connectors are pre disposed spaced out between neighbouring bars 6 6 or 6 5. One eyelet of each connector 29 is connected to the edge of the sheet 7, whereas the other eyelet runs on the respective wire 9 IO. This permits better anchorage of the sheet to the lateral wires. In the realization of Figs. 6 and 7 it can be seen that the bars 5 6 are of the type curving upwards, and the ends of said bars are envisaged as having tubular elements .30 31, of which the element 30 of the main bar 5 is flattened at 30a to enable said bar 5 to be fixed to the wires 9 IO. Said wires pass through the tubular elements 31 of the inter mediate bars 6 so as to permit sliding therein. The tubular elements serve to keep the curved bars in a generally vertical plane. By using the connectors 29 the number of the curved bars 6 can be sufficiently reduced. This invention eliminates the known system whereby sliding is carried out on rails or runways, said system being easily put out of use during loading by reason of ac cidental blows or because of environmental causes such as, for instance, snow, ice, etc. which make said known guide system unworkable, for the guide system with wires cannot be subject to permanent deformation, jamming or other effects often met with in the known system. The device according to the invention can be readily fitted to existing vehicle bodies in that it is only neces sary to pre dispose the supports 18g 19, 20 and 2I on the body and to instal the towing pulleys 25. It is easy for an expert in this field to apply various modifications to the realizations presented hitherto. For instance, it is possible to replace the endless wires 9 10 with two wires having drums to wind and unwind said wires positioned on the body. If the sheet is made of. a permeable material, it is clearly advantageous to visualize a btgger sheet to cover the sides of the body. To ensure opening of the sheet in such an embodiment, the pulling system can be motorized. Another obvious modification is the automation of the whole system by employing an electric motor that can be cover necked directly to. the axle 22.All these modifications and others again are possible within the scope of this invention as defined in the attached claims.
