# Control device for a two speed derailleur.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a control device for use in controlling a two speed derailleur via a control wire. The device comprises a fixing member 1 having a first pivot shaft 2 and a second pivot shaft 4 having its axis generally perpendicular to that of said first pivot shaft 2 . A control lever 3 is pivotally mounted on said first pivot shaft 2 , and displaceable between first and second speed change posit tions. A retaining means 35 is provided for retaining one end S₁ of said control wire W₁ . A release lever 5 is pivotally mounted on said second pivot shaft 4 on said fixing member 1 and displaceable at its distal end 5a away from or towards said control lever 3 . First and second biasing means 6, 7 are provided for biasing said control lever 3 towards its first speed change position and said release lever 5 at its distal end 5a in a direction towards said control lever 3 , respectively. Cooperating retaining means 34, 53 are provided on said control lever 3 and at the distal 5a end of said release lever 5 , for retaining said control lever 3 in its second speed change position against the biasing force of said first biasing means 6 through said release lever 5 .
