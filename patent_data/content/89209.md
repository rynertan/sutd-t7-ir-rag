# Improved compensated load cell.

## Abstract
A single beam load cell is compensated for both longitudinal and lateral displacement of the load. In one embodiment, strain gages 1 4 are placed on both sides of the single beam 30 and the strain gages 1 4 are placed on the beam 30 at a slight angle from the longitudinal axis of the beam. The beam 30 may be honed to compensate for both lateral and longitudinal displacement of the load. In addition, with the strain gages 1 4 displaced at a small angle with respect to the longitudinal axis of the beam, the load cell may be compensated for both longitudinal and transverse displacement of the load by placing resistors in parallel with two or more of the strain gages 1 4 . The single beam 30 is mounted or supported at one end thereof and the other end supports the platform 90 of the scale arrangement at or near an edge of the latter.
