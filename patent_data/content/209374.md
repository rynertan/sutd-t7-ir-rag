## Description
This invention relates to techniques for obtaining nuclear magnetic resonance NMR information from an object. More specifically, it relates to techniques for encoding information into the phase of a received NMR signal. NMR information about an object is ordinarily obtained by receiving a single time varying radio frequency rf signal. In imaging, for example, this time varying rf signal must provide the necessary information about the object being imaged, such as a human body. Therefore, the characteristics of this time varying signal must somehow be modulated by the atomic nuclei in the object to provide information about those nuclei. For example, in Fourier imaging, the distribution of nuclei of a particular element is typically encoded into the phase and amplitude of the received time varying signal. Various techniques have been developed for enabling the nuclei to encode information into the received signal. Examples of known techniques are described in GB A 2150303 and DEPT at Depth. Polarisation Transfer and Sample Localisation combined using surface coils by Bendall et al in J. Magn. Reson. The most common use of phase encoding in NMR imaging is to encode information about the spatial location of atomic nuclei having a particular resonance. Such nuclei are initially excited into a resonant state from which they decay according to an appropriate time constant. While in the excited state, the nuclei may be phase encoded by the application of a relatively low frequency pulsed magnetic field gradient. The effect of the low frequency gradient is to change the phase of the decay, but because the gradient varies across a spatial dimension, the amount of phase change varies according to the position of the nuclei, so that the resulting phases of the nuclei provide the desired spatial information. Several variations of this technique have been used, including the application of a range of field gradients having various amplitudes, and the application of a series of field gradient pulses during a series of echoing NMR signals to produce increasing amounts of phase encoding. Each of these variations can be used to obtain a two or three dimensional data set which may be Fourier transformed into a two or three dimensional spatial distribution of the excited nuclei. If the NMR signals themselves are received in the absence of any applied field gradient, but after phase encoding in all resolved spatial dimensions, spectroscopic frequency information about the nuclei at each spatial location will be received, indicating chemical shift information or field inhomogeneity information about the resonant atoms at that location. Another technique, referred to herein as the echo time encoded method, phase encodes spectroscopic information by changing the timing of one or more refocusing pulses in a pulse and gradient switching sequence which produces a series of spin echoes. The sequence also includes the application of an observation gradient during the echoing NMR signals, so that the refocusing of the nuclear spins is determined by the combination of the refocusing pulse and the observation gradient. A mismatch of the timing of these signals results in a phase change of the received NMR signal which evolves during the observation gradient and which depends on the frequency difference between the spin resonance of the nucleus and the reference frequency absent applied field gradients. This technique makes it possible to separate two chemically shifted systems such as lipids and water having the same resonant nucleus, in this case protons, but different resonant frequencies, and successive applications of the mistimed refocusing pulses make it possible to obtain more detailed spectral discrimination. Other techniques of encoding use rf pulses with spectra which include discrete frequency bands, but accurate generation of such spectra is difficult in practice. Also, continuous coverage of the complete range of resonant frequencies of an object requires more than one measurement, due to the gaps in the spectra. A number of techniques have also been developed for amplitude encoding of information, some of which are discussed below. Amplitude encoding, however, suffers a loss of sensitivity compared with phase encoding, so that phase encoding is often preferable. Most of the above described techniques of phase encoding depend heavily upon the application of pulsed magnetic gradient fields. These gradient fields are typically applied by gradient coils which have a number of problems, including audio frequency vibrations, high power supply requirements, and heavy duty switching requirements. It would be advantageous to provide phase encoding techniques which could be used without gradient fields. More generally, it would be advantageous to provide phase encoding techniques which would produce a continuous phase variation across the entire range of resonant frequencies using an rf pulse, providing greater flexibility than has previously been available. According to the invention there is provided a method for phase encoding and retrieving NMR information from an object, comprising the phase encoding of nuclei in the object to provide a phase encoded NMR signal, the step of phase encoding comprising applying an rf pulse with a substantially continuous frequency range covering a range of resonant frequencies of the nuclei, and producing a substantially continuous phase variation across the range of resonant frequencies in the nuclei of the object and receiving the phase encoded NMR signal, characterised in that the substep of applying an rf pulse comprises applying an rf pulse with a respective magnitude and a respective phase at each frequency of the frequency range, the respective magnitude or the respective phase being a function of frequency. The invention generally provides techniques for phase encoding in which an rf pulse produces a generally continuous phase variation across the range of resonant frequencies of the atomic nuclei which provide an NMR signal. One aspect of the invention provides techniques for phase encoding which make it possible to perform phase encoding without applying low frequency pulsed magnetic gradient fields. The invention thus makes it possible to perform phase encoding on conventional high resolution spectrometers without adding gradient coils of the type described above. The invention further provides phase encoding techniques which can be used on conventional NMR imaging systems with gradient coils to provide added versatility. In general, the present invention is based on the discovery that phase encoding of NMR information may be performed using sequences of rf pulses which produces a substantially continuous phase variation across the resonant frequency range of the atoms of an object. One embodiment of the invention is based on the further discovery that tailored rf pulses with either phase or amplitude spectra which vary with frequency may be used in the phase encoding of NMR information in a received signal. Another aspect of the present invention is based on the discovery that rf pulses which bring the atomic nuclei into the excited state may also be used in phase encoding. In addition, rf field gradients produced by inhomogeneous rf coils may be used in a sequence to perform phase encoding during excitation without the application of pulsed magnetic gradient fields. The rf pulse used in phase encoding may be a tailored pulse with either its magnitude or its phase varying linearly with frequency across a continuous range. The rf pulse may be generated by defining its magnitude and phase spectra, transforming them to obtain time varying real and imaginary components, and applying the rf pulse modulated by the real and imaginary components. The rf pulse may be applied through an inhomogeneous coil to produce an rf gradient field across the object, and the gradient field may have a null point within the object. In one embodiment, a tailored rf pulse with a linearly varying magnitude is applied through the inhomogeneous coil. Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which In order to understand the present invention, it is helpful to review some general aspects of NMR information retrieval. It is also helpful to consider an example of how tailored rf pulses have been used in the prior art. Fig. 1 sets forth in flow diagram form the fundamental functions performed during NMR information retrieval. In box 10, excitation waveforms are applied to an object in order to bring at least some of the atomic nuclei of the object into an excited state. The excitation waveforms are typically applied in the presence of a static magnetic field which establishes a reference resonant frequency f In box 20, encoding waveforms are applied to the object in order to encode information into the NMR signals. This may be done by encoding the spin magnetizations of the excited atomic nuclei with information relating to their spatial location, the chemical shift of their resonant frequency from f In boxes 10 and 20, the waveforms which are applied interact with the nuclei of the object to produce the desired effects. In general, each nuceus may be thought of as a spin system which is resonant at a frequency which depends on its makeup and on the local magnetic field. Therefore, each spin system, in effect, will only receive those input waveforms which are received at its resonant frequency. The phase and amplitude of the waveforms at that frequency will determine the subsequent response of that spin system. Therefore, the waveforms applied in boxes 10 and 20 may include waveforms which establish the local magnetic field in addition to the waveforms which perform excitation and encoding of information about the spin system. In box 30, as a result of the waveforms applied in boxes 10 and 20, an NMR response waveform is generated. This waveform occurs as the spin systems of the atomic nuclei in the object precess and decay from their excited state. The decay processes provide a waveform which may be received by an rf coil, detected with reference to a reference frequency, sampled, and stored in a data set for subsequent processing. If both amplitude and phase information are obtained, it may be possible to perform Fourier imaging by transforming the data set to obtain an image. Other techniques such as projection reconstruction may also be used to obtain an image from the data set. Even if the received NMR signal waveform does not include spatial information, it may be used to obtain spectroscopic information about an object. In any event, the usefulness of the output waveform in box 30 depends on whether useful information has been encoded into the spin systems of the atomic nuclei in box 20. Figs. 2 and 3 illustrate an example of how input waveforms may be applied to an object. More specifically, Figs. 2 and 3 illustrate how a tailored excitation, a specific types of input waveform which is used in some embodiments of the present invention, may be used in NMR imaging to select a specific part of an object to be imaged such as a slice. Fig. 2 shows how the tailored excitation for slice selection may be defined and generated. At the left in Fig. 2 is a spectral graph of the desired excitation pulse. The spectral graph includes a magnitude spectrum and a phase spectrum, both of which cover a range of frequencies. The frequencies of interest in Fig. 2 are a narrow band of frequencies between a lower bound f Fig. 3 shows how the tailored rf pulse of Fig. 2 may be applied as a selective excitation pulse which excites only the atoms of a slice of the object. In general, the object will be subject to a static magnetic field oriented along the Z axis, and the application of a pulsed field gradient G Figs. 2 and 3 illustrate that tailored pulses have been used as selective excitation pulses, and further variations on selective pulses are described in A. A. Maudsley, Multiple Line Scanning Spin Density Imaging , Journal of Magnetic Resonance, Vol. 41 1980 pp. 112 126 at 119 121. These prior techniques, however, did not recognize the possibility that a tailored rf pulse could be used in a sequence for phase encoding of NMR information, as in the present invention. As set forth below, it has been discovered that tailored rf pulses and other rf pulses may be applied in sequence for phase encoding NMR information about an object by producing a substantially continuous phase variation across the range of resonant frequencies of a set of atomic nuclei. Figs. 4A and 4B are spectral diagrams showing two examples of tailored rf pulses which may be used in sequences for phase encoding of information according to the invention. These spectral diagrams are based on the discovery that a tailored rf pulse having frequencies in a bounded continuous range can be used to provide phase encoding if either the phase or magnitude is constant across that range and the other spectrum, either magnitude or phase, varies linearly across the continuous range, which covers the range of resonant frequencies of the relevant atomic nuclei. Fig. 4A shows the amplitude or magnitude variant tailored rf pulse for use in a sequence according to the present invention. The amplitude variant pulse includes frequencies across a continuous range from the lower frequency f Fig. 4B shows a phase variant tailored rf pulse which also includes frequencies across the continuous range between f As discussed above in relation to Fig. 2, each of the spectra shown in Figs. 4A and 4B may be transformed to provide real and imaginary components, which may then be used to modulate an rf pulse applied as shown in Figs. 5A and 5B. Fig. 5A illustrates a simple example by which a 90 excitation pulse after a tailored rf pulse having spectra like those shown in Fig. 4A results in an FID signal in which spatial information is phase encoded due to the tailored rf pulse applied during gradient G and followed by a 90 excitation pulse. This technique is discussed below in relation to Fig. 7. If there is no spatial gradient in the local magnetic field during the application of a tailored rf pulse, no spatial encoding will occur but spectroscopic encoding of chemical shift information or field inhomogeneity information will occur. Fig. 5B illustrates an example in which a tailored 180 refocusing pulse having spectra like those shown in Fig. 4B results in an echo signal in which spectroscopic information is phase encoded. A preobservation gradient G is applied before the refocusing pulse so that the echo signal will occur at the center of a subsequent observation pulse G. If this echo signal is sampled, and the samples are stored in a data set which is subsequently transformed, spectroscopic information about the object can be obtained from the phase of the sampled signal. Although the pulse sequence of Fig. 5B is used for spectroscopic encoding, it could be used for spatial encoding by applying a pulsed magnetic field gradient during the tailored refocusing pulse. This gradient, however, must be orthogonal to the gradient G used for observation. In general, spatial encoding must be done for NMR imaging, and we turn now to further techniques for NMR imaging. As noted above, spatial encoding is necessary for NMR imaging. In other words, the locations of the nuclei generating a particular portion of a received NMR signal must be encoded into that signal somehow to permit resolution of the locations of the nuclei. As discussed above, the conventional techniques for spatial encoding using Fourier techniques generally require the application of pulsed magnetic gradient fields. One technique of applying rf pulses according to the present invention, however, makes it possible to perform continuous phase encoding without gradient fields, although rf pulses such as the tailored pulses described above may also be used with pulsed magnetic gradient fields, providing a wide variety of possible imaging techniques. In order to perform spatial encoding without pulsed magnetic gradient fields, it is necessary to modulate the local spin behavior in some other manner. The necessary variation in the local spin behavior can be provided with an appropriate rf coil which produces an rf field gradient across the imaged region. An rf coil which produces an rf field gradient has previously been used for application of an excitation pulse in the rotating frame method of imaging using amplitude encoding as discussed in D.I. Hoult, Rotating Frame Zeugmatography , Journal of Magnetic Resonance, Vol. 33 1979 , pp. 183 197. This aspect of the present invention makes use of such a coil to perform phase encoding for NMR imaging. Fig. 6A shows an rf coil configuration which can be used to apply an rf gradient field. Fig. 6B is a timing diagram of a pulse sequence applied through the coil configuration of Fig. 6A. Fig. 7 illustrates how the rf gradient field will affect volume elements of an object being imaged. Similar techniques are disclosed in co assigned U.S. application Serial No. 756 066 filed on 17 July 1985 , corresponding to US A 4703267 and EP A 209375. The coil arrangement shown schematically in Fig. 6A includes two rf coils, coil A and coil B. Coil A is a saddle type coil including two halves 40 and 50 which produce a homogeneous magnetic rf field in the Y direction as shown in Fig. 6A. Coil B, on the other hand, includes two halves 60 and 70 which produce an inhomogeneous magnetic field which could, for example, be a linear gradient along the X direction. Coil B may simply be a standard rf coil like coil A, but rewired so that it produces zero field at the center point between the coil halves 60 and 70. Although coils A and B are shown in orthogonal relationship in Fig. 6A, they need not be orthogonal and may instead lie along the same axis. In addition, additional coils could be provided at different orientations for producing inhomogeneous magnetic rf fields along each of the other directions. The object 80 to be imaged is shown between the coils in Fig. 6A, and it includes three small volume elements of spin magnetized nuclei, A, B, and C. Fig. 6B shows a simple pulse sequence using the coils of Fig. 6A to produce phase encoding. An inhomogeneous encoding pulse is first applied having a broad band of frequencies. Then a homogeneous 90 excitation pulse is applied, resulting in a FID signal. As discussed below, the phase encoding pulse of the FID signal is complete only when both of these pulses have been applied, even though we refer to the first pulse as an encoding pulse. Fig. 7 illustrates how the rf pulse sequence of Fig. 6 will affect the spin magnetization in each of the volume elements A, B, and C. A similar effect will result from the pulse sequence of Fig. 5A, in which, as in Fig. 6B, the tailored encoding pulse is 90 ahead of the excitation pulse in phase. In the first line of Fig. 7, the three volume elements are shown oriented along the Z axis, the position which they would take as a result of the static magnetic field on the Z axis. Then, as shown in the second line of Fig. 7, an rf pulse applied through coil B changes the orientation of the spin in some of the volume elements. Treating the spin behavior in a rotating frame of reference at the rf reference frequence f Immediately after the end of the encoding pulse applied through coil B, a 90 excitation pulse is applied through coil A, as shown in the third line of Fig. 7. This pulse is applied along the Y axis, at a phase of 90 relative to the X axis, so that it tips all of the spin axes out of the Y Z plane into the X Y plane. The spins will be tipped into the X Y plane with different phase, however, effectively completing the phase encoding. Furthermore, the excited nuclei will decay, producing a FID signal, as discussed above in relation to Fig. 5A. This FID may be detected by a receiver coil, and coil A of Fig. 6A is a suitable receiver coil. Figs. 8 10 illustrate more complicated sequences making use of the basic phase encoding techniques discussed above. Fig. 8 shows a sequence in which broadband encoding pulses are applied through inhomgeneous rf coils. Fig. 9 shows a sequence in which linearly varying tailored rf pulses are applied through homogeneous rf coils in the presence of pulsed magnetic field gradients. Fig. 10 shows a sequence in which a slice selective tailored rf pulse is applied through an inhomogeneous rf coil in the presence of a gradient field. Therefore, the sequences of Figs. 8 and 9 may be used in three dimensional imaging while the sequence of Fig. 10 may be used in two dimensional imaging. The pulse sequence of Fig. 8 makes use of three inhomogeneous rf coils like coil B in Fig. 6A to perform three dimensional spectroscopic imaging without pulsed magnetic gradient fields. Instead, a broadband rf encoding pulse is applied through each of the three inhomogeneous coils to provide a variation in amplitude in each of the three spatial dimensions. In Fig. 8, the pulses are shown in sequence, but they could all be applied at once. These pulses are preferably all applied along the X axis in the rotating frame, i.e., with phase equal to zero, as indicated in Fig. 8, after which a 90 excitation pulse is applied along the Y axis, i.e., with phase equal to 90 , in order to tip all of the spins into the X Y plane to complete the phase encoding, as in Fig. 7. As a result, an FID signal will occur containing three dimensional spatial information as well as spectroscopic information. This signal may be sampled and stored in a data set. In order to obtain a complete data set for imaging, however, it is necessary to apply the amplitude variant pulses at a number of amplitudes in the manner of Fourier imaging techniques, as indicated in Fig. 8. From the complete data set, the three dimensional image with spectroscopic information can be obtained by a transform such as a Fourier transform. Because the sequence of Fig. 8 requires that the broadband rf encoding pulses be applied at a number of amplitudes, the time required for making the necessary measurements and for the subsequent data processing is larger than for most forms of NMR imaging. The sequence of Fig. 8 may be advantageous, however, for the observation of sodium relaxation and chemical shift information. In this application, it is desirable to observe contributions resulting from short T₂ decay times, and this is made possible by the direct observation of the FID, which would not be possible with the more common spin echo technique commonly used for Fourier imaging. In addition, the short T₁ decay time for sodium permits a short repetition period between successive measurements, making the acquisition of a large number of measurements less burdensome. At the same time, however, the T₂ time is relatively short, so that relaxation effects occurring during the rf phase encoding pulses prior to observation must be taken into account in the subsequent processing. Fig. 9 shows a pulse and gradient switching sequence very similar to that of Fig. 8, but in which tailored amplitude varient pulses are applied during respective pulsed magnetic field gradients G Fig. 10 shows another application of the amplitude variant pulse of the present invention, this time to perform multiple plane two dimensional imaging, also rereferred to as two dimensional multislice imaging. A tailored amplitude variant pulse and a subsequent tailored 90 excitation pulse are applied to select a limited region of the object in order to obtain a two dimensional image rather than a three dimensional image, and this is accomplished by applying these pulses in the presence of a slice selective gradient along the G The pulse and gradient switching sequences of Figs. 8, 9 and 10 are merely a few examples of the multitude of possible phase encoding sequence making use of rf pulses according to the present invention. The phase encoding techniques according to the invention may also be used in conjunction with surface coil techniques, and, as discussed above, may be used in commercial high resolution spectrometer systems for imaging without providing a full set of field gradient coils and power supplies. The tailored phase variant pulses with spectra as in Fig. 4B are not used in any of the sequences in Figs. 8 10, but may also be used for specific examples of phase encoding. Because a phase variant pulse along one spatial axis cannot be spatially selective along an orthogonal axis, the phase variant pulse is not well suited for multislice imaging. It may, however, be useful in volume imaging and for single plane spectroscopic imaging in which a time delayed selective refocusing pulse is used to enable slice selection along with phase encoding of spectroscopic information. The sequence of Fig. 5B uses a tailored non selective phase variant 180 refocusing pulse, but could be modified for slice selection. A phase variant 90 excitation pulse may also be applied to perform phase encoding of spectroscopic information, with slice selection or additional spatial encoding being performed later. As noted above, the rf pulses may be used in a wide variety of sequences for phase encoding spatial and spectroscopic information. If a tailored rf pulse is used, the resolution in each of the encoding dimensions may be software programmable in that the magnitude or phase which varies across the frequency range of the pulse can be changed at will. In conventional Fourier imaging using pulsed magnetic field gradients, the spatial resolution in the encoding dimension depends directly on the number of independent phase encoding measurements made, and this resolution is constant across that dimension, so that it is not possible to image a limited region with increased resolution. With the tailored rf pulses, however, it is possible to program the phase encoding increment per point to be greater over a selected region, making it possible to obtain an image with varying spatial resolution, providing a sort of zoom capability. In general, the above description relates to the phase encoding of spatial and spectroscopic information. The rf pulses may, however, be used for encoding other types of information, such as information discriminating flow of velocities of fluids in an object. This might be done by measuring differences following the application of spatially dependent excitation and refocusing pulses.
