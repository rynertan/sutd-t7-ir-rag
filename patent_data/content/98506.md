# PROCESS AND APPARATUS FOR FORMING PERMANENT IMAGES USING CARRIER SUPPORTED INKS CONTAINING SUBLIMABLE DYES

## Abstract
A process for forming a permanent, abrasion and chemi cal resistant image on a fabric or plastic substrate is disclosed which comprises a providing a printing matrix having raised portions in the shape of the image to be printed on the sub strate, b providing a carrier supported ink comprising 1 a uniform coating of an ink composition comprising a sublimable dye, 2 a carrier sheet for supporting said coating on one sur face thereof, c disposing the carrier supported ink adjacent to the printing matrix such that the uncoated surface of the carrier sheet faces the printing matrix, d providing a fabric or plastic film substrate having a surface into which said sublim able dye can diffuse, e disposing the substrate such that the surface thereof faces the coated surface of the carrier sheet, f applying pressure between said printing matrix and said substrate to cause the printing matrix to contact the uncoated surface of the carrier sheet and the coated surface of the carri er sheet to contact the substrate surface, said pressure being applied under conditions sufficient to cause the ink composi tion to completely transfer from the carrier sheet to the sub strate surface in the shape of the image defined by the raised portions of the printing matrix, but insufficient to cause the dye in the ink composition to sublime or vaporize, and g heating the ink composition which has been transferred to the sub strate surface, said heating occurring under conditions suffi cient to cause the dye therein to sublime or vaporize and then diffuse into the substrate surface.
