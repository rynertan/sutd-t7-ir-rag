# Faulty memory processing method and apparatus.

## Abstract
A faulty memory processing method and apparatus, for a data processing system which executes a time sharing data process with breaks. A hard error which may exist in a cell in a normal memory 3 is detected by an error correction circuit 9, 10 . After correcting an error in information read out from a detected hard error cell in the normal memory, information including the above corrected information with respect to the detected hard error cell is transcribed into a relief memory 4 . The above correction and transcription is executed using the breaks in the time sharing data process.
