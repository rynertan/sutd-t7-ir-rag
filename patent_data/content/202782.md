## Description
The present invention relates to a process for producing a thermoplastic elastomer composition and to the composition produced by the process. In particular the invention relates to a process for producing thermoplastic elastomer compositions which are suitable for use in sealant or adhesive compositions. Thermoplastic elastomers i.e. elastomeric materials which are capable of being fabricated, including being reprocessed, by techniques conventionally associated with thermoplastic materials, are known. For example, US patent 3037954 discloses a process for preparing a thermoplastic vulcanised blend of crystalline polypropylene and rubbery polymers, particularly chlorinated rubbers but also including butadiene acrylonitrile rubbers. The process, which is known as dynamic curing comprises mixing together the polypropylene and the vulcanised rubber with a curing agent, which is not a peroxide catalyst, and curing the mixture at a temperature of 225 to 350 F 107 to 177 C while thoroughly mixing the composition. Thermoplastic elastomeric compounds prepared by dynamically curing blends of EPDM rubber and polypropylene and blends of nitrile rubber and nylon are disclosed in two papers by A.Y. Coran and R. Patel published in Rubber Chemistry and Technology volume 53 1980 Rubber Thermoplastic Compositions. Part 1. EPDM Polypropylene Thermoplastic Vulcanisates pages 141 to 150 and Rubber Thermo plastic compositions. Part II. NBR Nylon Thermoplastic Elastomeric Compositions pages 781 to 794. The known thermoplastic elastomers are believed to comprise domains of cross linked rubber dispersed in a thermoplastic. There is apparently no reaction between the thermoplastic and the rubber or curing agent. It has now been found that thermoplastic elastomers may be prepared from nitrile rubber and certain thermoplastics in which compositions both the rubber and the thermoplastic are cross linkable by a peroxy curing agent. Such thermoplastic elastomers may be suitable for use in sealant or adhesive compositions. According to the present invention a process for producing a thermoplastic elastomer comprises curing a blend of nitrile rubber and a thermoplastic under dynamic curing conditions characterised in that the blend comprises A a nitrile rubber, B a peroxy curing agent and C a homopolymer or copolymer of ethylene, which is curable with the peroxy curing agent, but excluding copolymers comprising ethylene and an acrylic or methacrylic ester, and in that the blend is cured by mixing at a temperature above the activation temperature of the peroxy curing agent and above the melting temperature of the ethylene polymer. The invention includes a thermoplastic elastomer composition obtainable by the process as hereinbefore defined. Nitrile rubbers are known copolymers of a diene and an unsaturated nitrile for example isoprene acrylonitrile copolymer and butadiene acrylonitrile. In the present invention a preferred nitrile rubber is butadiene acrylonitrile copolymer. Preferably the nitrile rubber, e.g. a butadiene acrylonitrile copolymer, has an acrylonitrile content of from 20 to 45 by weight. A mixture of two or more nitrile rubbers may be used. For example, a low molecular weight nitrile rubber, which is liquid at 20 C may be used together with a second nitrile rubber which is solid at 20 C. The use of a liquid rubber imparts to the final product good hot flow and wetting properties and tends to produce a comparatively softer product. Peroxy curable thermoplastics suitable for use in the present invention include polyethylene, copolymers of ethylene and another alpha olefin e.g. LLDPE , ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers, hydrolysed or partially hydrolysed ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers, ethylene vinyl ether copolymers, ethylene acrylic acid copolymers and mixtures thereof. The hydrolysed or partially hydrolysed ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers preferably have a relatively low OH content. Copolymers of ethylene and vinyl acetate are preferred. Ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers are known and some are commercially available. They can be made by conventional and well known methods. For use in the present invention, the ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer preferably has from 15 to 80 by weight of vinyl acetate and a melt flow index of from 2 to 600. An ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer having a high melt flow index will tend to produce a composition having a relatively low hot viscosity, whereas a copolymer having a high vinyl acetate content will tend to produce softer, more flexible compositions. Two or more ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers can be used to produce a balance of properties. Peroxy curing agents are known and include, for example, dicumyl peroxide 1,1 di tertiary butyl peroxy 3,3,5 trimethyl cyclohexane di tertiary butyl peroxide 2,5 dimethyl 2,5 bis tertiary butyl peroxy hexane tertiary butyl cumyl peroxide bis tertiary butyl peroxy isopropyl benzene tertiary butyl peroxy benzoate and 4,4 di tertiary butyl peroxy n butyl valerate. Also suitable for use in the present invention are bisperoxycarbamates as described, for example, by Dr. A.H. Verlag in Kunstoffe, 37 1984 Bisperoxycarbamates as Vulcanising Agents for Rubber pages 390 to 397. The peroxy curing agent may be supported on an inert carrier such as, for example, precipitated calcium carbonate, silica or Kieselguhr. Peroxy curing agents which have an activation temperature above 100 C but below 150 C, e.g. tertiary butyl peroxy benzoate, have been found to be particularly suitable for use in the process according to the present invention, especially when the nitrile rubber component comprises a mixture of liquid and solid nitrile rubbers. The ratio of nitrile rubber to the ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer is preferably from 1 5 to 4 1 parts by weight more preferably 1 2 to 2 1. The amount of peroxy curing agent is preferably from 0.4 to 4 by weight based on the total weight of the nitrile rubber and ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer. Preferably, the amount of peroxy curing agent used is such that it is substantially all reacted during the dynamic curing stage of the process so that no further curing occurs during subsequent processing or use of the composition. The actual amount of peroxy curing agent required for any particular blend will depend inter alia on the components of the blend, the curing agent used and the curing conditions and can be determined by simple trial and error experiments e.g. using small scale preparations about 70g of dynamically cured compositions in the absence of tackifying resins and waxes in a Brabender Plasticorder. When a thermoplastic elastomer composition according to the present invention is to be used in a sealant or adhesive composition, the amount of crosslinking agent used is preferably such that the maximum Brabender torque, which corresponds to the end of dynamic crosslinking, does not rise above 2000 metre grams and more preferably does not rise above 1000 metre grams at a rotor speed of 100 to 120 rpm and a compound temperature greater than 130 C. The applicants have found that thermoplastic elastomer compositions comprising nitrile rubber and ethylene containing polymers are particularly suitable for use in sealant and adhesive compositions, particularly when they are blended with a tackifying resin. Thus, according to the invention, a sealant or adhesive composition comprises A a thermoplastic elastomer which thermoplastic elastomer comprises a dynamically cured blend of a nitrile rubber, a peroxy curing agent and a homopolymer or copolymer of ethylene which polymer is curable with the peroxy curing agent and B a tackifying resin. The ethylene containing polymer is preferably a copolymer of ethylene and vinyl acetate. Tackifying resins are well known for use in sealant and adhesive compositions. For example, tackifying resins and their use in adhesives are described in Handbook of Adhesives edited by I. Skeist second edition, chapter 14, 1977, Van Nostrand Reinhold Company. Any of the known tackifying resins may be used in the sealant compositions according to the present invention. Particularly suitable resins are the hydrogenated rosins and hydrogenated rosin esters such as, for example, glycerol or pentaerythritol esters of hydrogenated rosins. The amount of tackifying resins included in the sealant composition is preferably from 5 to 100 parts by weight per hundred parts of the total weight of the nitrile rubber and ethylene containing polymer. Preferably the tackifying resin is blended with the thermoplastic elastomer composition produced by dynamically curing the nitrile rubber and the ethylene containing polymer. Thus, the process for producing a sealant composition according to the present invention preferably comprises curing a blend of nitrile rubber and an ethylene containing polymer, e.g. an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer, under dynamic curing conditions and subsequently blending the composition produced with a tackifying resin. A sealant or adhesive composition according to the present invention may also contain conventional additives such as, for example, antioxidants, fillers, pigments, softeners and processing aids. In particular compositions may comprise stearic acid as a processing aid, wax to reduce the melt viscosity of the composition and a metallic oxide such as, for example, zinc oxide, magnesia or a lead oxide, e.g. red lead Pb₃O₄ and litharge PbO as pigments or stabilisers. However, an oxide such as zinc oxide may cause further undesirable crosslinking of compositions comprising acrylic acid as comonomer. The compositions according to the present invention may also comprise a polymeric component having hydrolysable silyl groups. When such compositions are exposed to water, preferably in the presence of a silanol condensation catalyst, hydrolysis and condensation of the silyl groups further crosslinks the composition increasing the temperature resistance and stiffness. The hydrolysable silyl groups can be grafted onto the nitrile rubber or ethylene polymer using known techniques. Alternatively, or in addition, a silyl modified polymer may be blended with the composition according to the present invention. Silyl modified polymers are known and can, for example, be prepared by copolymerisation, silane grafting or transesterification techniques. For example, a thermoplastic organic polymer having pendant silane groups can be prepared by copolymerising an unsaturated monomer, such as ethylene, with an unsaturated silane compound having hydrolysable functions, in the presence of a free radical initiator or a Ziegler catalyst. Such copolymerisation techniques are described, for example, in GB A 2028831, GB A 2039513 and GB A 1415194. Methods for making thermoplastic organic polymer components by the silane grafting technique are disclosed, for example, in GB A 1357549, GB A 1234034 and GB A 1286460. A method for making thermoplastic organic polymer components by transesterification is described in EP A 4752. The components of the compositions according to the present invention may be mixed and cured in conventional rubber mixing equipment. As indicated above sealant compositions according to the present invention are preferably prepared by first dynamically curing the nitrile rubber and ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer and then blending into the thermoplastic elastomer composition the tackifying resin. Optional additives such as for example pigments, stabilisers, fillers, processing aids and softener are preferably blended into the mixture during the dynamic curing of the nitrile rubber and thermoplastic. A hot flow improver such as wax, if used, is preferably blended into the mixture after curing. Antioxidants may be added before or after the curing stage. The sealant and adhesive compositions according to the present invention are hot melt sealants, that is they are solid at room temperature i.e. approximately 20 C but become sufficiently fluid at elevated temperatures to wet substrates. The composition may be applied using the same or similar techniques to those known for applying hot melt sealants. The invention is illustrated by the following examples. 10.5 parts by weight of a commercially available nitrile rubber was charged into a 250ml Banbury mixer, which had been preheated to 100 C followed by 4.4 parts by weight of zinc oxide, 0.9 parts by weight of stearic acid and then 57.9 parts by weight of a mixture of two commerically available ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers. The mixture of ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers comprised 23.7 parts by weight of an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer having a vinyl acetate content of 70 and a melt flow index within the range of about 5, sold by Bayer under the trade name LEVAPREN 700 and 34.2 parts by weight of an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer, having a vinyl acetate content of 28 and a melt flow index of 400, sold by Esso Chemicals under the trade designation Escorene UL40028. The mixture of the two copolymers provided a balance of properties between the good hot flow properties imparted by the Escorene UL40028 and the relatively good flexibility and extensibility imparted by LEVAPREN 700. Escorene and LEVAPREN are trade marks . The nitrile rubber was an acrylonitrile butadiene copolymer rubber sold by BP Chemicals Limited under the trade name BREON N36C35. BREON is a registered trade mark . The rubber had a Mooney viscosity ML 1 4 at 100 C of 35 and contained 36 by weight of bound acrylonitrile. The specific gravity of the rubber was 0.98. The components were blended together in the Banbury mixer at a rotor speed of approximately 30rpm for two minutes, followed by 5 minutes at 100rpm. 31.6 parts by weight of a low molecular weight nitrile rubber sold by BP Chemicals Limited under the trade name BREON NBR 232 was then blended with the other components in the Banbury mixer. This nitrile rubber had a Brookfield viscosity at 50 C Spindle No 4 of 23 Pa.s and contained approximately 29 by weight of bound acrylonitrile. The use of this rubber which is liquid at 20 C with BREON N36 C35 which is solid at 20 C provided a balance of properties which imparted to the final product good hot flow and wetting characteristics. The blend was then cured using 1.1 parts by weight of a commercially available peroxy curing agent sold by Akzo Chemie under the trade mark Trigonox C which comprised 95 by weight of tertiary butyl peroxy benzoate. The curing agent was blended with the other components at a temperature below the activation temperature of the curing agent. The temperature of the mixer was then increased to a temperature of approximately 130 C, which is above the activation temperature of the curing agent, and the nitrile rubbers and ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers were cured while mixing was continued at a rotor speed of 100 rpm for about 20 minutes. During the dynamic curing, the compound temperature rose to 140 C. The heat was then removed and the rotor speed was reduced to 30 rpm. When the compound temperature had fallen to below 100 C, 10.2 parts by weight of a microcrystalline wax was added to and blended with the cured composition. The microcrystalline wax was a commercially available microcrystalline slack wax of low oil content sold by BP Oil under the trade name Micro Slack Wax 70. The wax had a specific gravity at 93.3 C, according to the standard test method I.P.160, within the range 0.81 0.818 and had a congealing point, as determined by standard test method ASTM D938 within the range 65 to 72 C. The composition was discharged from the Banbury and approximately 75g of the dynamically cured blend was placed in a Brabender mixer. 17g of a hydrogenated natural rosin tackifying agent sold by Hercules under the trade mark Staybelite was then blended into the composition at about 100 C. 20g of the product was moulded for about 3 minutes in a 150 x 150 mm press at 140 C and 20 tonne pressure. After cooling, the tensile strength, elongation and modulus of the composition, determined according to British Standard 903 Part A2, were as follows Tensile strength at yield 0.38 MPa at break 0.22 MPa Elongation at yield 73 at break 462 Tensile Modulus Stress at 100 0.35 MPa. A sample of the composition was heated to approximately 125 C and applied to the surface of a block of concrete. While the composition was still hot a second block of concrete was placed on top of the treated surface of the first block and the blocks manually pressed together for about 20 seconds. After cooling to room temperature approximately 20 C , it was found that the composition had adhered well to the concrete blocks and had retained good elastic properties. The composition was also found to adhere well to wood. Example 1 was repeated except that different proportions of the components were used and all the mixing was done in a Brabender mixer. The solid components were first charged and blended in the mixer and then the liquid nitrile rubber and peroxy curing agent, Trigonox C, were added and blended. The compound temperature was maintained below 100 C, i.e. below the activation temperature of the peroxy curing agent until the blending stage was completed. The circulating oil temperature was then increased to 160 C and the blend was dynamically crosslinked at a rotor speed of 120 rpm. The Brabender torque, which is proportional to viscosity, decreased at first as the temperture increased. As the temperature continued to rise and the peroxide decomposed, the torque increased to a small peak or plateau and then increased again to a maximum torque. The maximum torque for Example 2 was 650 m.g at 154 C and for Example 5 was 200 m.g at 135 C. It is believed that this indicates that both the ethylene copolymer and the nitrile rubber were crosslinked. After forming the thermoplastic elastomer composition, microcrystalline wax and tackifying resin were blended with it. Samples of the composition were compression moulded at 140 C as in Example 1. The proportions of the components used are given in Table 1 together with the physical properties of the compositions produced. The ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer Escorene UL05540 used was a product supplied by Esso Chemicals which had a vinyl acetate content of 40 by weight and a melt flow index of 55. ESCORENE is a trade mark . A number of thermoplastic elastomer compositions were prepared, Examples 6 to 10 and 13 being prepared according to the process described in Example 2 and Examples 11 and 12 being prepared according to the process described in Example 1 except that the tackifying resins and waxes were also blended into the composition in the Banbury mixer, rather than in a Brabender mixer. The components and proportions are given in Table 2 together with the physical properties of the compositions produced. Also given in Table 2 are the maximum Brabender torque values, which correspond to the end of dynamic curing, for Examples 6 to 10 and 13. The ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer AC430 is a commercially available material sold by Allied Corporation and is a low molecular weight copolymer containing about 26 of vinyl acetate. The peroxy curing agent Trigonox C 50 D is sold by Akzo Chemie and comprises 50 by weight of Trigonox C, i.e. the same curing agent as used in Examples 1, and 2 supported on silica. The curing agent was added at the same time as the zinc oxide and stearic acid rather than after the blending of the other components as was the case in Example 1. Flectol H is a commercially available atioxidant sold by Monsanto. Hercules A100 is a commercially available hydrocarbon based tackifying resin sold by Hercules. AC1702 is a polyethylene wax having a Mettler Drop Point ASTM D 3104 of 92 C and is sold by Allied Corporation. The results illustrate the range of properties which can be achieved by varying the components and proportions. A thermoplastic elastomer composition was prepared according to the process described in Example 1 except that the tackifying resins and waxes were also blended into the composition in the Banbury mixer. The composition comprised the following components The thermoplastic elastomer produced had a tensile strength at yield of 0.22 MPa, an elongation at yield of 1019 and at break of more than 1550. The modulus at 100 was 0.11 MPa and the Shore A hardness at 5 seconds was 10. A test was carried out to assess the performance of the thermoplastic elastomer as a gap filling sealant adhesive. Two unprimed concrete blocks measuring approximately 75 x 50 x 25 mm, separated by two 15mm thick wooden spacer blocks wrapped with silicone release paper were clamped together to form a gap 15mm x 50 mm x 25mm. The thermoplastic elastomer composition was used in the form of an extruded rope of 1cm diameter and was applied using a commercially available sealant gun at a temperature of 150 C. After filling the gap, the specimens were left to cool to room temperature about 20 C and were then tested using an Instron Tensile Testing Machine. The results are given in Table 3 together with results for a test in which the blocks of concrete were replaced by unprimed blocks of wood. In each case the joints failed adhesively. A thermoplastic elastomer composition was prepared as described in Example 2 except that the composition comprised the following components The thermoplastic elastomer produced had a tensile strength at break of 2.43 MPa and an elongation at break of 168 . The modulus at 100 was 1.95 MPa and the Shore A hardness at 5 seconds was 62. The ethylene acrylic acid copolymer used is a commercially available material sold by Dow Chemicals under the trade designation Primacor 5983. The copolymer contains 20 by weight of acrylic acid and has a melt flow index of 500. PRIMACOR is a trademark . A thermoplastic elastomer composition was prepared as described in Example 2 except that the composition comprised the following components The thermoplastic elastomer produced had a tensile yield strength of 0.71 MPa an elongation at yield of 238 and at break of 373 . The modulus at 100 was 0.57 and the shore A hardness at 5 seconds was 30.
