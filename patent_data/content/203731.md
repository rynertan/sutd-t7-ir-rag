# Transport device for the print unit of printing machines.

## Abstract
The device comprises an electric motor 6 whose rotor is capable of rotating selectively in either direction and a trans mission unit 21 comprises a sleeve 31 carrying a gear 19 at an input end in mesh with a pinion 18 on the motor shaft. At the output end of the sleeve 31 a toothed pulley 28 is en gaged with a tensioned, toothed belt 29 for moving the print unit back and forth. The sleeve 31 is journalled on a shaft 33 which can shift laterally at the input end and is urged by a spring 44 and lever 42 to shift in the sense forcing the gear 19 into mesh with the pinion 18 , thereby to minimise the radial clearance between the pinion and the gear.
