# Toothed belt and method with reinforcement cord.

## Abstract
A toothed belt that has a tensile member of spirally wound cord 22 where the operating pitch line of the belt is at least partially established by the cord which is made by twisting together at least two substantially zero twist, unequal denier yarn ends to form a ply, and twisting at least two of such plies together in the opposite direction to form the cord. Also disclosed is a cord useful for the above mentioned toothed belt and method and for the mechanical rubber goods and having unequal denier yarns twisted together to form a ply, and plies twisted together in the opposite direction to define the cord.
