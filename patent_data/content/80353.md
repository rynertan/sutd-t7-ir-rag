# Apparatus and method for measuring temperature profile.

## Abstract
A camera 20 contains a row of diodes 22 sensitive to infra red radiation and mounted on a turntable 24 for rotation about the optical axis of the camera. The signals from the diodes pro vide a temperature profile of a band across the width of a strip 10 of hot rolled steel moving in a direction orthogonal to the op tical axis 30 and to the lenght of the row of diodes 22. Since the diodes are low accurancy devices, their measurements are compensated by normalizing co efficients derived by compari son with the signal provided by an optical pyrometer 28 viewing the central part of the steel strip in the region of the op tical axis 30. To enable all diodes to be calibrated, calibration is effected with the turntable 24 rotated 90 to align all the di odes with the central part of the strip as viewed by the pyro meter 28. The camera may be mounted on one arm of a C frame 12 having X ray tubes in an arm 14 and X ray detectors in the other arm 16 for the purpose of measuring the thickness profile of the strip 10 in known way. The compensated temperature measurements can then be used to correct the corresponding thickness measurements to take account of the variation in ap parent thickness with density, and hence temperature.
