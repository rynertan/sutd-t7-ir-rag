# A method and a device for stiffening structures diagonally.

## Abstract
The invention relates to shelving structures and other structures which, for reasons of stability, require reliable stiffening diagonally in one or more planes, by means of two mutually intersecting wire like or rod like stays 3, 4 , the ends 5 of which are attached to the structure at four attachment locations 7 . A simple solution is afforded by the invention, according to which the point of intersection of the stays 3, 4 is displaced in the respective transverse direc tions of the stays 3, 4 , while at the same time holding the structure fixed in its intended position, until the stays extent, in which position the stays are connected together, either detachably or permanently, at said point of intersection by means of a suitable joint means 8, 9, 10 , for example a spot weld or a screw joint. When a screw joint 8, 9, 10 is used, the joint can be tightened from the front of a shelving structure 1, 2 placed against a wall.
