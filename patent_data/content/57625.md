# REGRINDABLE METAL CUTTING INSERT

## Abstract
A regrindable metal cutting insert 10 having a cutting edge 31 and an associated chip control surface 52 and at least one additional chip control surface 62 disposed behind the cutting edge 31 and being exposed only when a selected portion of the insert is ground away to form a new cutting edge. Chip configuration control is effected by means of a cutting edge formed with a transverse rake face 52 extending to a top shoulder 64 above and behind the cutting edge 31 and a rearward extending channel 50 that penetrates both the top of the insert 64 and the shelf type cutting edge 31 . Additonal transverse shelves 62 are formed at spaced apart locations behind the cutting edge 31 . When regrinding is necessary, the insert 10 can be ground back to the next rearward disposed shelf 62 form ing a new cutting edge with an associated chip control configuration. The rake face 52 associated with a cutting edge 31 of the insert can be coated with a suitable material such as titanium nitride. The insert 10 after grinding will still have a coated rake face associated with the new cutting edge.
