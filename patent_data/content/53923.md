# Seat track fitting.

## Abstract
An improved track fitting 10 for anchoring a seat to a seat track 12 has an anti rattle fastener member 40 for forcing a flanged top portion of a movement restricting shear pin 28 against the top of the seat track 12 to prevent rattle and wear due to vibrations. A pivoted lever 30, 34 which also functions as a cover plate for the track fitting is mounted on the body of the track fitting for lifting the shear pin 28 against the force of a spring 38 which normally urges the shear pin 28 into locking engagement with one of the slots in a seat track. To prevent tampering by a passenger, the lever 30, 34 is rendered inoperable when the anti rattle fastener member 40 has been actuated. A leaf spring 50 carried by the lever 30, 34 engages a body portion 20 of the track fitting and prevents the lever 30, 34 from rattling due to vibration. The lever 30, 34 can lock the shear pin 28 in its upper, disengaged, position as the track fitting 10 is lowered into the seat track 12 and can then be released so that the shear pin 28 will drop into one of the slots in the seat track 12 automatically as the fitting is moved slightly fore or aft.
