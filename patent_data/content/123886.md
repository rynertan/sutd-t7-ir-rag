# Print hammer assembly method.

## Abstract
A method of forming impact tips in a matrix printhead which employs hammers of the flat spring type. The impact pins are bonded to the hammers and are subsequently shaped using an electirc discharge milling process. The milling process serves to form the impact tips into the desired configuration as well as insuring the precision of spacing between the impact tips of the printhead.
