# Fencing screen for children at the cooking plane and the kitchen cooking control.

## Abstract
The screen can be fitted on the side walls of the control panel through distance threaded pins which allow the positioning regulation and disassembling. Formed by a flat front shape 1 in slanting position, with inside space and side containment sectors 2, 3 , the above screen acts as interposition and fencing structure to the approach of children and determinates a front cavity to reach from above for the knobs employ. It can be manufactured in light type materials and can be particularly used for cooking foods put in battery.

## Claims
Claims. 1 Fencing screen for children at the cooking plane and the kitchen cook ing control, characterized by the fact that it is substantially formed by a continuous wall screening shape in light material to fit on the control panel of the cooking equipment by means of distance threaded pins. For presetting, cavities are carried out in the wished position and then the screen is fitted by insertion and by screwing the distance pins into them. The flat front shape in slanting position forms an inside cavity contained in the lateral sectors this front cavity, that can be reached by an adult with the hand from above, will allow the conventional use of the knobs. 2 Fencing screen for children at the cooking plane and the kitchen cooking control, as to the claim 1, characterized by the fact that by properly regulating the screen on the pin holding it, its position can be regulated according to the actual employ requirements. 3 Fencing screen for children at the cooking plane and the kitchen cooking control, as to the claim 1, characterized by the fact that as soon as the necessity of using the screen leaves away, it can be removed by unscrewing the distance pins and by closing the relevant bores with the special small plates equipped with insertion pins.

## Description
Fencing screen for children at the cooking lane and the kitchen cook L C I CL ing control.The invention refers to a screening device to mount on the control panel in kitschens to prevent from reaching the knobs and the cooking plane by children.The means is particurlarly efficient in the cooking devices set in battery. It is well known that the cooking equipments are dangerous for children these ones,in fact, though of low stature, can act on the knobs of the control board or reach the cooking plane, thus interfering with the home activities, with the possibility of giving rise to heavy damage to themselves and to others for instance by upsetting a pot filled with boiling liquid or by allowing gas issue by tuning the knobs.The invented device, from the presupposition of the child s lower stature in comparison with the adult s, foresees the employ of a screening structure which can be reached exclusively by a person with an adult s stature. This enables the children to enter the kit chen room without any specific attending to them. The invented device is substantially formed by a continuous wall screen ing shape in light material to fit on the control panel fo the cooking equipment by means of distance threaded pins. For presetting, cavities are carried out in the wished position and then the screen is fitted by insertion and by screwing the distance pins into them. The flat front shape is slanting position forms an inside cavity contained in the late ral sectors this front cavity, that can be reached by an adult with the hand from above, will allow the conventional use of the knobs.By properly regulating the screen on the pin holding it, its position can be regulated according to the actual employ requirements.As soon ase the necessity of using the screen leaves away, it can be removed by unscrewing the distance pins and by closing the relavant bores with the spcial small plates equipped with insertion pins.An execution form is illustrated in a merely indicative way by the drawings of Table 1, where Fig. 1 is the perspective view of the screen manufactured in anodized aluminium plate and on which one of the fixing elements can be observed as well as the wide front cavity which can be reached from above for acting on the knobs. Fig. 2 is the side view of a food cooking device with the screen fitted on it, the two line supports can be noticed which bind its adjustable position. Fig.3 is the front view of the cooking device without screen, and the four small plates can be noted which cover the relevant supportin bores for the screen. Fig. 4 is the view of one know actioning on the control board it will be noted that the wide front opening performed by the screen enables an easy movement. Fig. 5 is the view of the regulation system for the distance of the screen mounting, which permits either the return or the going out of the distance pivot from the control board. The version employs the shape vith the continuous form of plate and flat front wall 1 with inward inclination and lateral symnetrical con tainment sectors 2 and 3. The screen thus formed is fitted with four devices with initial body 4 and with regulation knob 5 for the outgoing of the threaded pin 6 introduced through the bored plate 7 into the bore on the control board 8. The screen can be manufactured in plate and other light materials, such as metals, their alloys or other.The supporting and regulation means can be foreseen otherwise.
