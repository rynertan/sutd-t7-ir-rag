## Description
TRICYCLIC COMPOUNDS, PROCESSES FOR THEIR PREPARAON, COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING SUCH COMPOUNDS AND THEIR USE IN MEDICINEThe present invention relates to tricyclic compounds having valuable monoamine oxidase inhibitory activity.Monoamine oxidase MAO is a brain enzyme believed to be responsible for intraneuronal catalysis of oxidation of biogenic amine neurotransmitters to inactive forms. It is understood to occur as two independent enzymes normally designated MAO A and MAO B White and Glassman, J. Neurochem., 29, 987 997, 1977 and Tipton et al, tiMonoamine Oxidase and its Selective Inhibitors ,Beckmann and Riederer, Eds., Mod. Probl. Pharmacopsychiat., 19 15 30, Karger,Basel 1983 . MAO inhibition has been found to elevate neurotransmitter concentration in the brain. MAO inhibitors are used therapeutically in the treatment of a wide variety of conditions, especially depression, particularly when characterized by anxiety, obessional neuroses, or appetite disorders.However, many known MAO inhibitors such as pheneizine have an undesirable side effect associated with ingestion of food or drink containing tyramine, for example certain cheeses. When a patient receiving a conventional MAO inhibitor ingests a tyramine containing product, then his blood pressure may be raised, sometimes to a dangerous level. Such patients are therefore instructed to avoid certain foods.In M.Harfenist, J.Med.Chem. 23 1980 825 7, there is described a compound 3acetamidothioxanthen 9 one 10,10 dioxide hereinafter termed the known compound having MAO inhibitory activity. However, the known compound is an arylamide derivative and it is known that many arylamines and arylamides, as well as compounds which are, metabolised thereto, have significant carcinogenicity eg.see Charles C. Irving, Aromatic Amines and Azo Dyes, in Proc. 2nd FDA Symp. on structural Correlates of Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis, US Naval Academy, 1977, pp 136 ff . In general, arylamides and their derivatives are prone to cause bone marrow depression, methaemaglobin formation and other toxic effects. Moreover, the known compound is structurally related to the known carcinogen 2 acetylaminofluorene. Such toxicity is especially undesirable in compounds likely to be administered repeatedly over prolonged periods, as is normally anticipated for the prevention or alleviation of the symptoms of chronic mental disorders. The known compound has also shown weak activity in animal models predictive of antidepressant activity in man. Other thioxanthen 9 one i0, 10 dioxide derivatives are also known as therapeutic agents, for example as described in US patent specification nos. 4 091 108 and 3 905 989, and in UK patent specification no. 3 905 989 hereinafter termed the Hodson and Batchelor specifications . However the latter class of compounds are only disclosed as anti allergic agents and there is no suggestion that they might possess useful MAO inhibitory activity. Included in this class is the compound 3carbamoyl 7 methylthioxanthen 9 one 10, 10 dioxide.We have now discovered that the compounds of formula I as defined hereinbelow have shown unexpectedly superior potency relative to that of the known compound when tested in a screen predictive of anti depresent activity. Moreover, since many of the compounds of formula I are not arylamines or arylamides, they do not carry such a potential risk of carcinogenicity and the other toxic effects.Thus the present Invention provides compounds of formula I EMI2.1 wherein n is 0, 1 or 2 one of R1 and R2 is hydrogen and the other is selected from carbamoyl, N C 4 alkylcarbamoyl, N,N di C1 4alkylcarbamoyl, carbamimidoyl, N C1 4 alkylcarbamimidoyl, N2 C1 4alkylcarbamimidoyl, N1 4alkyl N C1 carbamimidoyl, NÚ,NÚ di C1 4alkylcarbamimidoyl, NÚ,NÚ di C1 4alkyl Nê C1 4alkylcarbamimidoyl, tetrazol 5 yl optionally substituted by one or more C14 alkyl groups and imidazolin 2 yl optionally substituted by one or more C14 alkyl groups andR3 is selected from hydrogen, saturated and unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon moieties containing from I to 4 carbon atoms, groups OR4 where R4 is selected from hydrogen and saturated and unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon moieties containing from I to 4 carbon atoms , halo, groups of formula NR5R6 where R5 and R6 are independently selected from hydrogen, C1 4 alkyl and hydroxy Cl 4 alkyl, provided that the total number of carbon atoms in R and R6 does not exceed 4 , amino C1 4 alkylamino and morpholino provided that when R1 is carbamoyl, R2 is hydrogen and R3 is hydrogen or methyl, or when R1 is 2 methyltetrazol 5 yl and R2 and R3 are both hydrogen, then n is 0 or I and when R1 is unsubstituted tetrazol 5 yl, R2 is hydrogen and R3 is selected from hydrogen, chlorine, methyl, ethyl and t butyl, then n is I.Included within the meaning of the compounds of formula I are the physiologically acceptable salts of such compounds. Thus, unless the context requires otherwise, any reference herein to one or more compounds of formula I is to be taken, equally, as a reference to physiologically acceptable salts thereof.The present invention also includes pro drugs and metabolites of the compounds of formula I and their physiologically acceptable salts. By pro drugs is meant those compounds which are metabolised in vivo to form a compound of formula I or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof. By metabolite is meant any compound resulting directly or indirectly from the in vivo metabolism of a compound of formula I or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof.Certain thioxanthen 9 ones, and their 10 oxides and 10,10 dioxides, said to be anti allergic agents, are described respectively in UK patent specification 1458 185 and US patent specifications 4 091 108 and 3 905 989 hereinafter referred to as the Batchelor and Hodson Specifications . We have also discovered that as well as the compounds of formula I , some compounds disclosed in the Batchelor and Hodson specifications are also unexpectedly advantageous MAO A inhibitors. The aforementioned known compounds and the compounds of formula I , together constitute a class of compounds of formula I and their pharmacologically acceptable salts. In formula I EMI3.1 n is 0, 1 or 2 one of R1 and R2 is hydrogen and the other is selected from carbamoyl, N C 1 4 alkylcarbamoyl, N,N di Cl 4alkylcarbamoyl, carbamim idoyl, Nl Cl 4 alkylcarbamimidoyl, N2 N cl 4alkylcarbamimidoyls Nl Cl 4alkyl N2 cl 4 alkylcarbamimidoyl, NÚ, NÚ di C1 4alkylcarbamimidoyl, NÚ, NÚ di C1 4alkyl Nê C1 4alkylcarbamimidoyl, tetrazol 5 yl optionally substituted by one or more C14 alkyl groups and imidazolin 2 yl optionally substituted by one or more C1 4 alkyl groups and R is selected fom hydrogen, saturated and unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon moieties containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, groups OR4 where R4 is selected from hydrogen and saturated and unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon moieties containing from I to 4 carbon atoms , halo, groups of formula NR5R6 where R5 and R6 are independently selected from hydrogen, C1 4 alkyl and hydroxy C14 alkyl, provided that the total number of carbon atoms in R5 and R6 does not exceed 4 , amino C1 4 alkylamino and morpholino provided that when R1 is carbamoyl and R2 and R3 are both hydrogen, then n is 0 or 1.Included within the scope of the compounds of formula I are also the physiologically acceptable salts of such compounds. In particular, the latter salts and also the pharmocologically acceptable salts of compounds of formula I may be the acid addition salts of compounds wherein one of R1 and R2 represents a carbamimidoyl, Nl Cl 4 alkylcarbamimidoyl, N2 C1 4alkylcarbam imidoyl, NÚ C1 4alkyl Nê C1 4alkylcarbamimidoyl, NÚ, NÚ di C1 4alkylcarbam imidoyl, NÚ, NÚ di C1 4alkyl Nê C1 4alkylcarbamimidoyl or an optionally 3 alkylated imidazolin 2 yl group and or R represents a group of formula NR5R6, an amino C1 4 alklamino group or a morpholino group, for example those derived from hydrochloric, hydrobromic, phosphoric, malic, maleic, fumaric, citric, sulphuric, lactic and tartaric acids.In formulae tI and F , when R3 andlor R4 is a saturated or unsaturated C14 aliphatic hydrocarbon moiety, these groups may be selected independently from, for example C14 alkyl, C2 4 alkenyl and C24 alkynyl groups.A preferred sub class of the compounds of formula I comprises those compounds wherein RÚ is hydrogen, R2 represents an imidazolin 2 yl group or an N C1 4alkylcarbamoyl group especially N methylcarbamoyl and R3 represents a group selected from C14 alkyl especially isopropyl , mono or di C14 alkylamino and morpholino and physiologically acceptable salts thereof.Other sub classes of compounds of formula I and their physiologically acceptable salts include those wherein i R1 is hydrogen ii R2 is hydrogen iii one of R1 and R2 is hydrogen and the other is selected from carbamoyl, N C1 4 alkylcarbamoyl, carbamimidoyl, NÚ C1 4 alkylcarbamimidoyl and imidazolin 2 yl and R is selected from hydrogen, saturated and unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon moieties containing from I to 4 carbon atoms, groups OR4 where R4 is selected from hydrogen and saturated and unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon moieties containing from I to 4 carbon atoms , halo, groups of formula NR5R6 where R5 and R6 are independently selected from C14 alkyl and hydroxy Cl 4 alkyl, provided that the total number of carbon atoms in R5 and R6 does not exceed 4 , amino alkylamino and morpholino provided that when n is 2 and R2 is hydrogen, then a R1 is not carbamoyl when R3 is hydrogen or methyl and optionally b R1 is not N methylcarbamoyl when R3 is hydrogen and iv one of R1 and R2 is hydrogen and the other is a tetrazol 5 yl group optionally substituted by one or more C14 alkyl groups and R3 is selected from hydrogen, saturated and unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon moieties containing from I to 4 carbon atoms, groups OR4 where R4 is selected from hydrogen and saturated and unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon moieties containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms , halo, groups of formula NR5R6 where R5 and R6 are independently selected from C14 alkyl and hydroxy Cl 4 alkyl, provided that the total number of carbon atoms in R5 and R6 does not exceed 4 , amino alkylamino and morpholino with the optional proviso that when R1 is unsubstituted tetrazol 5 yl, R2 is hydrogen and R3 is selected from hydrogen, chlorine, methyl, ethyl and t butyl, then n is 1 and when RÚ is 2 methyltetrazol 5 yl and R2 and R3 are both hydrogen, then n is 0 or I.

Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which may comprise one or more accessory ingredients. In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.Formulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient as a powder or granules as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non aqueous liquid or as an oilin water liquid emulsion or a water in oil liquid emulsion.A tablet may be made by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, lubricating, surface active or dispersing agent.

Thus according to a further feature of the present invention we provide a process for the preparation of compounds of formula I as hereinbefore defined and their physiologically acceptable salts, the said process comprising a reacting a compound of formula tII EMI9.1 wherein R3 and n are as previously defined, and one of R7 and R8 is hydrogen and the other is a precursor for a group RI or R2 respectively, as hereinbefore defined with an agent or agents serving to effect conversion of the R7 or R 3 group to the desired R1 or R2 group as appropriate or b oxidising a compound of formula III EMI9.2 therein R1 R3 and n are as defined above and R9 is a methylene group or a group of formula f OH . Where appropriate, in either of processes a and b above, the reactant compound of formula II or III may be provided in the form of a suitable salt thereof. The above processes, where appropriate, may also include one or more of the following optional steps i Converting the resultant compound of formula I or salt thereof, or a precursor therefor, into a physiologically acceptable salt thereof. ii Where the group R3 in the resultant compound of formula 1 is a displaceable group, for example a halogen such as fluorine, converting 3 the compound to another compound of formula I wherein R is a group OR4 or NR5R6 as defined, or an amino C14 alkylamino group, by reaction with an appropriate alkoxide or amino compound, for example NaOCH3 or HN CH3 in a suitable solvent, e.g. methanol or dimethylformanide DMF preferably in the presence of a base. It will be appreciated that similar displacements may also be performed at various stages of the preparation of compounds of formula I . iii At an appropriate point in a synthetic route tosa compound of formula I , protecting one or more functional groups for example, converting the central carbonyl group to a ketal group and in a later or final step, deprotecting in order to regenerate the desired group. iv Where, in a compound of formula I or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof, n is 0 or I, increasing the oxidation state of the sulphur atom so as to form repectively, a corresponding compound or salt wherein n is 1 or 2, or 2. Again, it will be appreciated that oxidation of the sulphur atom may be performed at any appropriate stage of the preparation. v Where, in a compound of formula I or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof, R1 or R2 represents an unsubstituted carbamoyl or carbamimidoyl group, alkylating the said group to form a corresponding compound wherein R1 or R2 as appropriate, represents an N C1 alkylcarbamoyl, N,N di Cl 4 alkylcarbamoyl, Nl Cl 4 alkylcarbamimidoyl, Nê C1 4alkylcarbamimidoyl, Nl Cl alky2C14alkylcarbamimidoyl1 N1, N1 di C14alkylcarbamimidoyl or N1, di C14alky1 N2 C14 alkylcarbamimidoyl group. Such alkylation may be performed by any of the methods well known to those skilled in the art, for example by reaction with an alkyl eg.methyl halide, for example the iodide.A particular example of this conversion is the conversion of a carbamoyl group to an N C1 4 alkylcarbamoyl group, for example N methylcarbamoyl. vi Where, in a compound of formula I or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof, R1 or R2 represents an unsubstituted tetrazol 5 yl group, alkylating the said group to form a corresponding compound wherein R1 or R2 as appropriate, represents a C14 alkyltetrazol 5 yl group. Such alkylation may be performed by methods as described in optional step v above.For the preparation of compounds of formula I wherein one of R1 and R2 is hydrogen and the other is a carbamoyl, N C1,4 alklycarbamol or N, N diC1 4alkylcarbamoyl group, process a above may comprise reaction of a compound of formula II wherein one of R7 and R8 is hydrogen and the other is an appropriate carbonyl derivative with one or more suitable reagents serving to effect amination of the said carbonyl derivative. Thus for example, where theR7 or R8 group represents an activated carbonyl group such as an ester or an acid chloride, the compound of formula II may be reacted with ammonia or a corresponding alkyl or di alkylamine, for example methylamine, preferably under aqueous conditions.If the carbonyl derivative is carboxy, the compound of formula II may be treated with a reagent serving to effect formation of a corresponding activated acid, in the presence of, or followed by reaction with an appropriate reagent such as described above in respect of reactions with esters and acid chlorides.The reagent serving to effect formation of a corresponding activated acid may be sulphur oxychioride, a phosphorus halide such as phosphorus tri or pentachioride, a phosphorus oxyhalide such as the oxychloride, trifluoroacetic anhydride, an alkyl eg. ethyl chloroformate or any other suitable agent which will be apparent to those skilled in the art. A list of such reagents appears inMethoden der organischen Chemie, Houben Weyl, 4th Edn., Vol 15, 1, p.29.Conveniently, the reaction may be performed in a suitable solvent such as toluene, desirably in the presence of an appropriate catalyst such as dimethylformamide. Alternatively the reaction may be effected by reaction with an appropriate weak or volatile base such as methylamine, preferably by heating. Such a reaction conveniently may be effected using a stream of methylamine or by use of methylamine in situ in the presence of a dehydrating agent. For the preparation of compounds of formula I wherein one of R1 and R2 is hydrogen and the other is a carbamimidoyl, NÚC1 4 alkylcarbamimidoyl, NêC1 4alkylcarbamimidoyl, NÚ C1 4alkyl Nê C1 4alkylcarbamimidoyl, N1,N1 di C14 alkylcarbamimidoyl, Nl,Nl di Cl 4alkyl N C1 4alkylcarPamimidoyl, or optionally alkylated imidazolin 2 yl group, the precursor group may be a cyano group.For the preparation of compounds of formula fizz wherein one of RÚ and Rê is hydrogen and the other is an optionally alkylated tetrazol 5 yl group, in process a , the compound of formula II may be reacted with hydrazoic acid the precursor and the reaction conditions may for example be as described in theBatchelor and Hodson specifications.In process b , the oxidation may be effected by reaction with hydrogen peroxide in acetic acid, with an organic peracid such as meta chlorobenzoic acid in an inert solvent, eg. chloroform or dichloroethane, or with an inorganic peracid.Alternative oxidising agents for use in this stage of the process include ozone and alkali metal permanganates. Where the reaction is performed in an organic solvent, a crown ether is preferably included to ensure solution of the product.Other suitable inorganic oxidising agents include alkali metal chromates and dichromates in an unreactive solvent such as acetic acid. When it is also desired to perform the sulphur oxidation of option iv above and this is not brought about simultaneously with the oxidation of the 9 OH group in process kb , then it may be effected by admixture with a catalytic amount of strong base such as an alkali metal hydroxide or alkoxide, e.g. the t butoxide, thereby promoting the air oxidation.The following examples illustrate the present invention.Example 1 Reference Preparation 3 N methylcarbamoylthioxanthen 9 one 10, 10 dioxideTo 345.29 1.2mol or 3 carboxy lO, 10 dioxothioxanthone was added 1.5Kg SOC12 and the mixture was refluxed overnight to convert the 3 carboxy group to the corresponding 3 carbonyl chloride, i.e., acid chloride.

Biological Activity I. MONAMINE OXIDASE INHIBITION In Vitro InhibitionA. In Vitro InhibitionMAO was assayed with t3H serotonin 0.2 mM, 5 Ci mol and 14C 8 phenethylamine 10 pM, 3 Ci mol as substrates in a double label assay White and Glassman, J. Neurochem 29 987 97 1977 .For studies of the kinetic mechanism of inhibition, the above method was used, except that a single substrate serotonin or tyramine was varied over a 10 fold concentration range that included the Km concentration. MAO activity was determined in the absence and presence of the compound under test at each substrate concentration in duplicate assays.MAO activity was determined in the absence and presence of the compound under test at each substrate concentration. Table I below lists I50 values found for certain of the preferred compounds of formula I . For comparison, the value is also quoted for the known compound designated KC . Table I Inhibiton of MAO A In Vitro Compound I50 X10 6M H 0.05 J 0.02 L 0.04 0 0.012 E 0.20 S 0.05 KC 0.06Compound S produced a potent selective inhibition of MAO A which was competitive vs. the substrates, serotonin or tyramine K. 0.016 llM with serotonin as substrate.B.In Vivo InhibitionTo determine MAO inhibition in brains and livers of rats pretreated with reversible inhibitors, it was necessary to use an assay procedure that minimized dilution of the inhibitor. Thus, high concentrations of brain tissue homogenates were incubated for very short incubation times. For brain assays, initial tissue was 3 fold diluted into each assay. Because of the very high MAO activity in liver homogenates, further dilution of tissue was necessary in order to obtain reliable data. In this case, three different homogenate concentrations were assayed, and precent inhibition was extrapolated to zero tissue dilution.Substrate concentrations were not saturating, but were chosen relative to Km values for serotonin and phenethylamine in order to give an estimate of MAO A and B, respectively.Brains from pretreated male Sprague Dawley rats sacrificed 3 hours after oral dosing , were homogenized in a buffer consisting of 0.1 M potassium phosphate and 5 sucrose pH 7.4 at a 1 1 tissue wt buffer volume ratio, using a motorizedTeflon glass homogenizer. MAO A and B were determined by incubating 100 LI of tissue homogenate with 50 lil of a double label substrate mixture to give final concentrations of 3Hi serotonin, 0.4 mM 5 Ci mol and 14C henethylamine, 20 VM 3 Ci mol . For blank assays 100 grl portions of homogenate were preincubated at 37 0C with pargyline 4 mM before substrate addition. Incubations were at 370C for 30 sec.Assay mixtures were then acidified and products extracted as in the above in vitro method. Liver tissue was homogenized in the above phosphate sucrose buffer at a 1 5 tissue wt buffer volume ratio. Portions 5, 10 and 50 pl of each homogenate were assayed with 50 Ill of the above double label substrate mixture in a total assay volume of 150 p1 0.067 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.4. Blank assays included the same amounts of homogenate pre incubated with 4 mM pargyline for 15 min at 370C. After addition of substrates, mixtures were incubated at 370C for 20 sec, acidified, and products extracted as above. Percent inhibition for each liver homogenate was obtained by plotting inhibition vs. reciprocal of tissue concentration and extrapolating back to zero dilution.For the compound of the invention, the following results were obtained at 3 hr after oral dosing.Dose Percentage Inhibition of MAO A mg kg p.o. Brain Liver 12.5 37 16 79 5 25 49fix 94 4 50 78 2 92 4 ED80 values for the known compound and Compound S were both found to be 50 mg kg p.o. for brain. There was no significant inhibition of MAO B in either tissue. In other experiments with the compound of the invention, for an oral dose of 50 mg Kg, inhibition was found to maximise within 3 7 hours and to be negligible at 24 hours after dosing, indicating reversibility of the in vivo inhibition.II. EFFECTS ON BLOOD PRESSURE RESPONSE TO ORAL TYRAMINECompound S was tested for effects on the pressor response induced by tyramine in a conscious, unrestrained rat model. The method involves direct measurement of arterial blood pressure from a cannula implanted in the carotid artery and exteriorized through a small incision in the back of the neck. Peak changes in the pressor response following tyramine p.o. administration in animals pretreated with the compound of the invention p.o. were compared to changes seen after tyramine in animals pretreated with the MAO inhibitor, phenelzine p.o. , and control water treated animals.To compare effects at equipotent doses that are relevant to antidepressant activity, either Compound S or phenelzine was given in a single oral dose that produced approximately 80 inhibition of brain MAO A by the time of tyramine administration. Under these conditions, MAO A of liver was inhibited by 90 or more.Rats treated with vehicle exhibited blood pressure elevations at relatively high doses of tyramine above 27 mg kg. Pheneizine pretreatment increased the responsiveness to tyramine 3 to 10 fold, whilst Compound S did not cause a statistically significant increase in the pressor response to tyramine, except at the high oral dose 90mg kg tyramine.III.ACTIVITY IN AN ANIMAL MODEL PREDICTIVE OF ANTIDEPRESSANT ACTIVITYPrevention of Tetrabenazine Induced Sedation in MiceCharles River CD 1 male mice 18 22 gms were pretreated orally with various doses of the known compound, Compound S or the reference standard, phenelzine, 60 min, 3 hr, or 5 hr before injection of tetrabenazine 35 mg kg i.p. . This dose of tetrabenazine caused 90 100 of treated mice to remain motionless with marked blepharoptosis, even when placed into a novel environment. Thirty minutes after injection of tetrabenazine, each mouse was scored on an arbitrary scale from one to four according to Vernier et al., in 1st Hahnemann Symp. on Psychosomatic Medicine, J.H. Nodin and J.H.Moyer Eds.,Lea and Febiger, Philadelphia, 1962, pp 683 90 for both depression of exploratory behaviour 1 4 and presence or absence of blepharoptosis 1 4 . Ratings were converted to a percent of rating received by mice receiving amitriptyline prior to tetrabenazine administration. Rectal temperature was also determined 30 min after tetrabenazine.90 minutes after oral treatment with the compound of the invention a dosedependent prevention of tetrabenazine induced sedation was obtained. The oralED50 for the prevention of tetrabenazine induced sedation at this time period was 49 10 mg kg. The ED50 values obtained at 3 and 5 hr after treatment withCompound S were essentially the same as those found at 90 min. For the known compound, an ED50 was not reached by 100mg kg p.o. However by extrapolation the ED50 was estimated as 200mg kg. For comparison, pheneizine had an oral ED50 value of 16 Img kg. IV TOXICITYExcept for moderate hypothermia in mice at 1000mg kg, p.o., no overt symptoms occurred in rats or mice at accute does up to 1000 mg kg, p.o. Thus, the pharmacological index ratio of no visible symptom dose to ED50 for potential anti depressant activity is 20 in mice and 10 in rats accute oral dosing. No mortality occurred in rats or mice after acute i.p. doses of up to 1000 mg kg.Moderate hypothermia and muscle tone decrease were observed at 500 1000 mg kg, i.p.
