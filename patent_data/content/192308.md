## Description
The invention relates to a reservoir to be placed in a fixed position on the ground, e.g. a swimming pool or a storage tank for liquid and or solid bulk goods having little or no cohesion, e.g. crop products, coal, manure, spreading salt and the like, said reservoir having at least a bottom and an upright wall connecting thereto and resistant to outwardly directed pressure, said upright wall consisting of Such a reservoir is known from EP A 0 060 084. This prior art reservoir comprises a plurality of wooden posts driven into the ground. As a result of this inherently stiff or immovable construction hydrostatic forces resulting from the filling of the reservoir tend to break these wooden posts at ground level. The construction of the swimming pool according to CH A 396 351 is defective in that the boards which are supposed to give some distribution of outwardly directed forces resulting from the filling of the pool, give raise to an outward bulging of these boards resulting in slits appearing between adjacent boards. When the reservoir is emptied and the boards assume their original rest positions, it can not be avoided that the flexible liner is clamped in between the sharp edges of the boards, thus resulting in probable damage of the liner. GB A 1 049 272 discloses a swimming pool provided with a wire mesh having very little circumferential tension resisting properties, and an inner water tight liner resting with its upright wall part against the wire mesh through an intermediate layer of heavy duty synthetic plastic material having a thickness in the range of 0,020 to 0,040 inch. Especially for larger constructions bringing about larger hydrostatic forces, it can not be avoided that the force distribution of the liner, especially in the area of the mesh wires, causes local stretching and therefore plastic deformation of the liner and the heavy duty synthetic plastic material. None of the references briefly discussed above allow a reservoir of the type specified above to be constructed such that it allows a simple and ready construction, whilst nevertheless the structure is extremely heavy duty, i.e. well resistant against even the most heavy internal load. Therefore, it is a purpose of the invention to provide a reservoir according to the preamble of this description, which is constructed in such a way, that it allows the reservoir to be constructed with far larger dimensions than the pior art reservoirs. In view of the above purpose the reservoir according to the invention is characterized in that between the upright wire mesh attached to the vertical piles and the upright wall part a substantially rigid board is arranged for distributing outwardly direced forces, This reservoir according to the invention can be built very simply and with little knowledge and training at comparatively low cost. A specific embodiment of the reservoir of the invention is characterized in that each pile is inserted in a tube extending in the ground leaving free some space between them, each pile optionally taking the form of a tube filled by pouring. In order to achieve that the bottom is capable of good plastic deformation while preserving the required properties, for example impermeability to water, preference is given to the embodiment in which the bottom and upright wall connecting thereto comprise a layer of plastic material. By way of orientation the bottom can consist of a several centimeter thick layer of foaming concrete arranged on the ground and a subsequent plastic membrane impermeable to water, onto which another layer of foaming concrete is arranged. This construction has the advantage of having a long deformation line and of adapting easily if necessary to small changes in the around structure. Yet another embodiment can display the feature that in addition to the upright wall part resting against the inner side of the piles, an upright wall part is arranged extending around the outer side of the piles and the space between both these wall parts is filled by pouring with a curing material such as floating concrete. Great wall strength is hereby achieved with very simple means, while contrary to the known art no use is made of shuttering to be removed later. In another embodiment use can be made of a possibly slack roof covering which extends over the upper edge of the upright wall and is supported in the centre by for example a constructed horizontal beam. In this case the supporting beam can support on the bottom of the reservoir. The supporting beam can advantageously consist of a construction consisting of tubes filled by pouring, whereby the tubes form for example the ribs of a cube. In a further practical embodiment the reservoir according to the invention can display the characteristic that the upright wall is provided close to its upper edge and above the maximum filling level of the reservoir with at least one gas outlet duct connecting to a tube with water seal. Such an embodiment is particularly of practical importance in the case of a reservoir serving as manure store. Advantageously the reservoir according to the invention may be characterized in that the wire mesh consists of wire mesh portions, each of both outer zones of each portion being attached to a respective pile. This structure allows a very simple construction of the reservoir. Especially the embodiment which is characterized in that the horizontally extending mesh wires are attached to said piles by means of end loops allows a simple construction by one registering the corresponding end loops of adjacent wire mesh portions and subsequently pushing the piles through the sets of registered loops. Finally the invention extends to a method of constructing a reservoir which is characterized in that after levelling the ground where required, the reservoir bottom is laid thereon, that around this bottom vertical tubes are placed in the ground at intervals from one another, that upright piles are placed in said tubes leaving free some space between them, that to the inner side of said piles is a circumferentially closed upright wire mesh is attached, and that an upright wall part formed or arranged on the bottom part is arranged against said wire mesh, overing same,between the upright wire mesh and the upright wall part a substantially rigid board being arranged. The invention will now be elucidated on the basis of the drawing, in which Fig. 1 shows a bottom 1 consisting of a layer 3 of foaming concrete arranged on the ground 2, the concrete having arranged on it an impermeable membrane 4, on which is placed a layer of foaming concrete 5. Fig. 2 shows the laying of membrane or foil 4. This is round in shape and displays on its circumference holes 6 arranged at regular mutual intervals having radial slots 7 open to outside, as is shown in more detail in fig. 3. These holes and slots are arranged in the edge zone 28. On the inner side of the edge zone is arranged a cylindrical casing shaped foil part 8 intended for the forming of an upright wall part. After the laying of foil 4 holes are made in the ground via holes 6 using an earth drill 9. In accordance with fig. 4, tubes 10 are placed therein, these tubes being provided on their underside with horizontal bearing pins 11 which serve in the way shown in fig. 5 to support a pile 12 to be placed later. As fig. 6 shows, such a pile can take the form of a tube later filled by pouring with concrete 13. Fig. 6 shows the manner of attaching wire mesh members 14 on pile 12. These horizontal wire mesh members 14 display on their ends loops consisting of an end that is bent round and welded. Referring back to fig. 2 it is noted that connections 15, 16 are positioned outside the yet to be placed reservoir such that the user can fill and empty the reservoir using his own means. For this purpose use is made of lines 17, 18 which emerge above foil 4. This aspect will be discussed further in reference to fig. 32. Fig. 7 shows how wire meshes 19 are linked with vertical piles 12. As fig. 8 illustrates, boards 20 are arranged against wire mesh 19 on the inner side for the distribution of the force which the filling of a reservoir applies to the wire meshes. As according to fig. 8 one board extends between two adjacent piles. A strip 89 is arranged on the inner side over the seam between boards 20. This is attached to only one board, in order to avoid possible thermal stress. In the variant according to fig. 9 wire meshes 21 are arranged between piles 12 leaving an intermediate pile free the same applies to the associated boards 22. There will usually be no fixed relationship between the length of the boards and the mutual spacing of the piles. Fig. 10 shows a completed reservoir 23 in an embodiment, namely one in which the wire meshes are accessible on the outer side. Fig. 11 shows a possible way of attaching upright foil part 8 to wire meshes 19, namely by means of hooks 24. Fig. 12 shows edge zone 28 which in this embodiment is provided with tensioning lips 25 arranged with a regular distribution and extending in radial direction, which serve to tighten foil 4. Fig. 13 shows this latter in the final configuration. Fig. 14 shows a variant in which edge zone 28 is provided with an extra edge zone 26 having tensile strength which serves to replace tensioning lips 25. Edge zone 26 will be further mentioned in reference to fig. 16 and 17. Fig. 15 shows a completed reservoir 29. This differs from reservoir 23 according to fig. 10 in that wire meshes 19 are no longer visible but are covered by wall parts 30 extending on the outer side. These wall parts can take the form of foil or reinforced synthetic textile strip or the like. Fig. 16 and 17 show the construction of the said wall parts 30 as according to fig. 15. As is seen in these figures, another wall part 30 is arranged outside each wire mesh 19 such that a pouring space results which is filled with a layer 31 of foaming concrete in the way indicated in these figures. In the embodiment according to fig. 16 edge zone 26 having tensioning strength is placed on the ground 2, while in the embodiment according to fig. 17 edge zone 26 with the lower edge zone of wall part 30 coupled thereto is entrenched in the ground 2. The concrete wall is supported by a slide layer 90, over which edge zone 28 can slide in the case of load variations, for example varying fillings and temperature variations. Prior to filling the pouring spaces with concrete 31 in the embodiment according to figures 15, 16, 17 the reservoir is filled with the material it is intended for, such as water, spreading salt, sand or the like. In this way the wall construction comes under tensile stress. Filling by pouring under this stress results in a construction analogous to that of prestressed concrete. Without going into details it can be stated that the pouring height must be selected to conform with the specific weight of the pouring material and that of the filling of the reservoir. A partially prestressed construction is thus obtained in a very simple manner with all the resulting advantages, particularly in the unfilled state. Fig. 18 shows a reservoir 32 having an upright wall part 33 the outwardly directed force of which is absorbed by tensioned ropes 34. Attention is drawn to the fact that the mutual spacing of ropes 34 becomes greater with increasing height in view of the diminishing hydrostatic pressure, wholly analogous to the construction of wire meshes 19, 21 according to the fig. 7, 8, 9. The vertical piles consist in this case of substantially omega shaped profiled beams 35 with recesses 36 see fig. 21 for the passage of ropes 34. Wall parts 33 are anchored in bottom 37 by anchoring members 38. On bottom 37 is placed a foil 39. The edge of this is sealing connected with wall part 33 by a weld zone 40. In the absence of foil, a mastic joint can be applied. Fig. 19 shows an alternative in which anchoring members 38 are omitted. A plastic foil 41 is situated under the bottom 37. Fig. 20 shows a reservoir 42 having two wall parts 33 which are held together by ropes 34 which also co operate with beams 35. There are overlapping zones 43 present of the adjoining wall parts 33. These latter are sealing coupled there with one another. Fig. 22 shows how this coupling is carried out. Between both boards is located a rubber sealing strip 44, while two connecting strips 45 and 46 respectively are placed on the inner and outer side and coupled by bolts nuts 47. Fig. 21 shows the construction of the omega shaped beams 35 and the manner of fixing of ropes 34. Fig. 23 shows the coupling element 48 as illustrated in fig. 20. It consists of a housing into which the ends of rope 34 are inserted, after which the housing is filled with a curing plastic. Fig. 24 shows a cube shaped structure 49 which serves as roof support. This support 49 comprises tubular parts 50 which are connected to one another with corner elements 51 and, as is indicated symbolically by a funnel 52, are filled by pouring with for example concrete or sand. Fig. 25 shows a reservoir 53 with a roof support 54 which is constructed in accordance with the embodiment as in fig. 24. Fig. 26 shows an upper edge of a reservoir which is provided with a cover 55 see also fig. 25 , this cover displaying at least one opening 56, which connects with the environment via a water seal 57. A roof 58 consists of a foil that is supported in the centre by support 54 and connected at the edges to edge 59. Fig. 27 shows, in contrast to the fixed connection 60 of roof 58 with wall part 30, that roof 58 can be provided along its circumference with loops 61 which can be hooked round knobs 62 in the way shown in fig. 28. Fig. 29 shows that use can also be made of connectable vertical piles 63, namely piles having a lower part 64 of smaller diameter, such that this lower part fits inside the upper part of another identical pile. In this way any required height of a reservoir according to the invention can in principle be realised. Fig. 29 also shows the way in which the sack 65 serving as impermeable foil can in this case be placed so as to be later folded outwards such that it comes to rest against the members 66 having tensile strength, such as ropes or wire meshes, which are arranged between piles 63. Fig. 31 shows a pile 63 in detail. The uppermost pile can be closed by means of a stopper 67. Fig. 30 shows a reservoir 68 which is filled with a liquid 69 on which rests a covering 70. On covering 70 rests a foil form roof 71. Fig. 32 shows another possible bearing construction for a roof. This bearing construction comprises a vertical hollow pipe 72 on the upper part of which is attached a collar 73 provided with supporting eyes 74 for radial bars 75 the ends of which can be bent over to rest on the annular cover 55. In another undrawn embodiment use is made of a cover with supporting eyes or hole which is placed on pipe 72. Pipe 72 is provided with holes 76 and an upper end open for de aeration. It is supported by a table 78 which is supported by supports 79. Under these emerges a feed outlet pipe 80. Supports 79 bear on a flange construction 81 which co operates with sealing via an impermeable foil 82 and a bottom part 83 with a flange part 84 which is joined to a pipe connection 85. Finally fig. 33 shows schematically a reservoir 86 that is provided with a feed system 87 and a draining system 88 having a sample pit 91. The following general remarks are made within the framework of the invention. As a variation on a circular form, other suitable shapes for the reservoir can be used, whereby it is noted that the circular form ensures homogenous stress in the wall, which furthers the consistency of shape. The fixing tubes that are to be placed in the ground, for example tubes 10, can consist of any suitable material, for example PVC. In the placing of these tubes 10 it is preferably ensured that they project some distance above the ground, so that they can be easily found again for the positioning of piles 12. The wire meshes can be placed in register, after which the piles or steel tubes 12 are placed and arranged in the positioning tubes 10. This operation can if desired be prepared per group. After its completion steel tubes 12 can if necessary be filled in the way indicated in fig. 6 with a curing material such as concrete in order to prevent deformation under load. For the force distributing boards 20, 22 use can be made of plastic boards which are brought on the market by the DSM concern under the trade name REKO boards. Depending on the filling, liquid, solid substance, an extra interior covering may or may not be necessary. In a simple embodiment outer wall parts 30 and the filling by pouring with for example concrete 31 can be omitted. The REKO boards can be provided with an overlapping or free end zone with connecting piece with a view to expansion shrinkage, particularly in the case of temperature changes. Ropes 34 in the embodiment according to fig. 18, 20, 21, 22, 23 can be of the type on the market under the trade name POLYSTAL . Attention is drawn to the fact that the variant according to fig. 20 is not provided with an extra, closed interior covering. With reference to fig. 2 it is also noted that connections 15 and 16 are placed such that the user can transport in this case manure to and from the reservoir using his own means without an extra pump.
