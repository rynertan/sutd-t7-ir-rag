# Thermal recording apparatus.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a thermal recording apparatus comprising a plurality of aligned thermal resistive elements 4 a plurality of drive elements 3 each serially connected to the thermal resistive elements 4 , for driving the thermal resistive ele ments 4 a DC power source 5 connected in parallel with the thermal resistive elements 4 and the drive elements 3 and having a smaller current capacity than the necessary current to simultaneously drive all the thermal resistive ele ments 4 a capacitor 6 having a large capacitance con nected, in parallel, to the DC power source 5 a detecting means 7, 8, 9 for detecting the voltage across the capacitor 6 and comparing it with a predetermined voltage and, a limiting means 10, 11 for limiting the number of the thermal resistive elements 4 simultaneously driven when the detected voltage falls below the predetermined voltage.
