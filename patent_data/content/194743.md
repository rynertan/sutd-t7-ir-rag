# Computerised tomography scanner and detector therefor.

## Abstract
A CT scanner comprises a rotatable gantry 1 carrying an X ray source 3 which provides a fan shaped beam of X rays and an X ray detector 10 which scans the X ray intensity along a line in the plain of the beam. The gantry is rotatable about an axis A relative to a couch 2 which supports the patient under investigation. The X ray detector 10 is of novel construction, compris ing two concentric X ray masks exposed around a scintillator tube the two masks have helical X ray transmissive aper tures, the helices being of opposite senses so that rotation of the masks in opposite directions causes the exposed area of the scintillator tube to move along its length.
