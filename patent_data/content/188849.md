## Description
The present invention relates to an improved apparatus for feeding bars to a machine tools, in particular a multispindle lathe. Apparatus of this kind are known in which each bar is fed to the lathe through the intermediary of a plurality of pairs of arrays of jaws, which pairs are opposed and aligned in succession and form a runway for the bar. The said jaws extend radially from a drum which can be controlled to rotate stepwise so as to ensure continuous and automatic feeding to the machine tool when the working of each bar has been terminated. In order to load the bars into the feeding apparatus in a radial direction, the said jaws comprise an array fixed to the drum in a stationary manner, while the opposed array can be distanced from the fixed array so as to form an aperture for radial placement of the bar. To this end, each movable array of jaws is provided with its own control system. An apparatus of the kind briefly described above forms subject matter of Italian patent application No. 21988 A 83 filed on July 8, 1983. The relevant technology may be understood from such application. Although the apparatus in question operate more than satisfactorily, they are somewhat heavy and costly because the stresses and strains occurring in them make it necessary to secure the arrays of stationary and movable jaws, and the control systems for the latter, to longitudinal girders which are in turn secured to the rotary drum. The object of the present invention is, therefore, to embody an apparatus in which the overall construction of the stationary and movable jaws is such as to permit these, and their relative control devices, to be mounted in an extremely straightforward and economical manner compared to what occurs in the known art, at the same time providing a highly dependable functional system which requires only a small financial outlay for maintenance and part replacement. To attain this object, the invention according to the present application embodies an apparatus for feeding bars to a machine tool, in particular a multispindle lathe, which comprises a plurality of pairs of opposed arrays of jaws, stationary and movable respectively, which extend radially from a rotary drum and in which the movable array of each pair can be distanced from the other, stationary array through a control system, wherein the stationary arrays are formed of side by side sets of jaws extending radially in a single piece from the respective central hubs fitted onto said drum and there locked against rotation, and wherein the movable arrays are fixed to radial tongues extending from respective central hubs which are also fitted and locked onto said drum between said sets of jaws. The structural and functional characteristics of the present invention and its advantages over the known art will become more apparent from the following illustrative description, referred to the appended drawings, of one form of embodiment thereof based on the principles of the invention. In the drawings With reference to the drawings, the apparatus according to the invention is indicated overall by the reference numeral 10, and consists structurally of a stepwise rotatable drum 11 which carries radially a plurality of pairs of opposed arrays of jaws 12, 13, stationary and movable respectively Figure 1 2 . According to the invention, the stationary arrays 12 are formed of side by side sets 14 of jaws 15. Each set 14 Figure 4 is formed in a single piece of plastics material possessing suitable mechanical properties, in particular a resin with adequate stress and friction resistance, comprising a central hub 16 from which the jaws 15 extend. The hub 16 characteristically features in its interior a plurality of interspaced radial slots 17 which stably lock the set onto the drum 11 the sets 14 are fitted onto the drum 11 with the slots 17 engaging profiles 18 secured to the drum. There is thus provided a stable key type coupling between the parts. The hub 16 also characteristically features, proximally to the fats end of the jaws 15, projections 19 each traversed by a through bore 20, the function of which is explained hereinafter the projections 19 are, moreover, interconnected in alternate pairs by reinforcement ribbings 21. As is clearly shown in Figures 1 and 2 of the drawings, the through bores 20 of the sets 14 of jaws 15 are traversed by shafts 22 to which are pivoted radial tongues 23 carrying respective rods 24 to which the arrays 13 of movable jaws 25 opposed to the jaws 15 are fixed. According to the invention, linkages 26 which actuate the movable jaws 25 are carried by respective control shafts 27 mounted within bores 28 of sets of radial tongues 29 extending from respective central hubs 30 Figures 1, 2, 5 and 7 which are fitted and locked onto the drum 11, interposed in a suitable number between the sets 14 of movable jaws 15. To such end, the hub 30 has a structure in part equivalent to that of the hub 16, with slots 31 for coupling to the profiles 18 and with bores 32 for the passage of the shafts 22. Additionally, each hub 30 features a crown 33 with apertures 34 through which emerge the tongues 23 carrying the arrays 13 of movable jaws 25. The resulting apparatus for feeding bars to a machine tool, in particular a multispindle lathe, fully attains the object mentioned in the preamble hereto. For it is evident that the apparatus described above with reference to the appended drawings is from the standpoints of construction and mounting far more straightforward and thus more economical than all the known apparatus intended for the same purpose. It is in effect vastly advantageous to be able to embody each sub set of stationary jaws in a single piece of plastics material which is also able to carry the movable jaws and the mounting of which is by simple fitting onto the drum. In this way, the lengthy and costly operations of welding each single jaw to an intermediate support girder are eliminated.
