# Co ordinate measuring systems.

## Abstract
A co ordinate measuring system for determining the rela tive measurements of an object includes a probe which has a plurality of faces which are interconnected so as to form two parallel X co ordinate probe surfaces 12 and two parallel Y co ordinate probe surfaces 14 . At the instant the probe contacts a surface on the object being measured, an electrical circuit 10 is completed through the probe to ground potential via the object, causing the measurement to be displayed on a visual display device 20 or 22 . In this manner, measurements along the X and Y co ordinates can be made and re corded at the instant the probe contacts the respective sur faces. An automatic unlatching feature is provided wherein the probe must be a predetermined distance from both the X and Y surfaces before the system automatically resets.
