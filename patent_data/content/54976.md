# Process for preparing spherical alumina beads.

## Abstract
Spherical particles of alumina are prepared by agitat ing a slurry of solids comprising rehydratable alumina solids in water with a hot immiscible liquid to disperse droplets of the slurry in a continuous phase of the im miscible liquid. The droplets are shaped by interfacial surface tension and are hardened by heat while in the immiscible liquid, then are separated and calcined to produce finished spherical alumina beads. The preferred beads are of size less than one millimeter. These are used as supports for catalysts that are used in several oil refining processes such as hydrotreating for removal of sulfur or for reforming or cracking.
