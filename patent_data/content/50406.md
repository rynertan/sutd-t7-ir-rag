# Conditional branch prediction apparatus and method.

## Abstract
A branch prediction mechanism comprises a pre diction memory 40 a hash device 44 connected to receive instruction addressed from an instruction address register 42 an address register 46 connected with the prediction memory for receiving hash addresses from the hash device an address buffer 48 for receiv ing hash addresses from the hash address device a count register 54 for receiving the output from the prediction memory a count buffer 58 for receiving out put counts from the count register an increment decre ment unit 56 for receiving input counts from said count buffer and branch outcome inormation for updating the count according to the branch outcome and a write data register 52 for receiving the updated count infor mation from the increment decrement unit, the branch prediction mechanism, in operation, operating to predict branch instructions on a continuously updated history of recently executed branch instructions.
