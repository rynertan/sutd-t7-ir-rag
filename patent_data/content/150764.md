# LIGHT SOURCE DEVICE

## Abstract
A light source device which employs light energy transmit ted through an optical conductor cable as a photosynthesizing light source for cultivating plants. The light energy emitted from the optical conductor cable is effectively dispersed in order to nurture plants. The light source device is comprised of one or more optical conductor cables, a first base plate having one or more holes for inserting the optical conductor cables, a second base plate mounted adjacent to the first base plate on the lower side thereof and having one or more holes for inserting the tip end portions of the optical conductor cables passing through the holes of the first base plate, and a motor mounted on the first or second base plate for rotating it.
