# METHOD OF MEASURING BIOLOGICAL LIGANDS

## Abstract
A highly sensitive and specific method of measuring a biological ligand which is suitable as a clinical test for determining physiological substances and trace com ponents in humoral fluid comprises allowing there to coexist in an aqueous medium a system comprising A a ligand 1 to be measured, B a combination of a biotinyl enzyme inhibitor and a ligand 2 having an antigenic determinant which is also an antigenic determinant of ligand 1 and C an antibody capable of reacting with said antigenic deter minant, contacting said system with a biotinyl enzyme, mea suring the residual biotinyl enzyme activity and utilising the measurement thereby obtained as a measure of the biologi cal ligand.
