# Process for high temperature drive in diffusion of dopants into semiconductor wafers.

## Abstract
A process for high temperature, rapid drive in diffusion employs a planar blackbody source placed in parallel alignment with a semiconductor wafer in a vacuum proces sing chamber. The wafer is rapidly heated, preferably to a temperature in the range of 1100 C to 1300 C and primarily by radiation which promotes uniformity. Typical diffusions are completed in less than one minute. In order to control diffusion distance at elevated temperatures, the process time and source temperature are carefully controlled, and the peak wafer temperature is monitored.
