# Device for feeding work to a machine tool.

## Abstract
Device for feeding work U to machine tool comprising a work table 11 and an air float 14 in a water vessel 15 and connected with said table by a rod 12 so that said work is pushed up against the tool WL as working proceeds. In one embodiment, a manometer 19 for detecting air pressure in said buoy is so arranged that when detected air pressure is deviated from preset value, a signal generated therefrom may control pump valve means 23, 24 for supply ing water into said vessel 15 . In another embodiment, a second rod 33 arranged to be in parallel to said first rod 12 to be vertically moved upward in a preset rate and a load cell 39 arranged between said two rods in such a way that when electrical resistance thereof is deviated from a preset value, a signal generated therefrom may control air pressure in said air float 14 .
