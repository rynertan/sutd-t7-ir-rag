# Gas mixing apparatus.

## Abstract
A gas mixing apparatus in the form of an anaesthesia apparatus includes a first path for oxygen, a second path for nitrous oxide and third path for carbon dioxide. The first path is divided for at least a part of its length into first and second by pass passages 210,212. A valve 214 in the first by pass passage 210 is inter connected with a valve 222 controlling the flow of a nitrous oxide through the second path and a valve 215 in the second by pass passage 212 is interconnected with a valve 232 controlling the flow of carbon dioxide through the third path. The intercon necting means 250, 260 are so arranged that the opening of the valves 222, 232 associated with the second and third paths causes corresponding opening of the valves 214, 215 associated with the by pass passages such that the total flow of oxygen through the apparatus will never fall below a predetermined minimum proportion by volume.
