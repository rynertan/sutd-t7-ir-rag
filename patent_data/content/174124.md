# FIBER OPTIC WORKSTATION DATALINK INTERFACE

## Abstract
Workstations may advantageously be interconnected in a cluster arrangement wherein multiple slave stations utilize the database which exists in a master unit. The cluster interface has been implemented as a wired system but the latter involves significant limitations as to distance between units, electrical noise restricting data transmission rates and the protection of sensitive data from compromise. The fiber optic interface module of the present invention eliminates the foregoing limitations by translating the elec trical signals of the wired system into optical signals for transmission and restoring them to electrical signals at a receiving unit.
