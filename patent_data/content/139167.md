# Method and apparatus for blending solids or the like.

## Abstract
Particulate materials are blended in a vessel 10 pro vided with a plurality of vertically extending conduits 24,26,28,30,32,34 therein. The vessel 10 comprises a downwardly converging frustoconically shaped bottom wall 16 which defines the lower region of the vessel. The conduits 24,26,28,30,32,34 are provided with a plurality of longitudinally extending compartments 42,44,46 having openings 37 within the upper region of the vessel 10 . The lower ends fo the conduits 24,26,28,30,32,34 and the compartments 42,44,46 therein extend through the bottom wall 16 , each communicating via a corresponding connect ing conduit 24a,26a,28a,30a,32a,34a with a solids outlet 20 at the open bottom of the bottom wall 16 . At least one drain conduit 52 communicates between a corresponding opening 48 in the bottom wall 16 and a corresponding compartment 42,44,46 at a location below the bottom wall 16 . A baffle 58 is disposed within the vessel 10 separat ing the upper and lower regions and comprises a downward ly converging inverted generally conical portion 60 spaced above the bottom wall 16 and defining therebetween a downwardly converging annular passage 68 . Extensions of the compartments 42,44,46 are contained within the con necting conduits. Various arrangements of positioning and spacing of drain conduits 52 and corresponding openings in the bottom wall 48 are disclosed to improve flow, sampling and blending of particulate materials from the lower region of the vessel 10 . Methods of blending solids using the described apparatus are also disclosed.
