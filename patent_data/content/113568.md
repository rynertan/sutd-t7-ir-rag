## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO NOVEL CEPHALOSPORIN INTERMEDIATES This invention relates to a novel process and intermediate for the preparation of ceftazidime. There is a continual need to develop new antibiotics because of the constant threat that antibiotic specific resistant strains of pathogenic microorganisms will emerge. Because of high development and production costs, particularly in the area of cephalosporin antibiotics, researchers are searching constantly for new and efficient means for producing these antibiotics. In this regard, U.S. Patent No. 4,258,041 describes the synthesis of 6R,7R 7 f Z 2 2 amino thiazol 4 yl 2 2 carboxyprop 2 oxyimino acetamidc 3 l pyridiniummethyl ceph 3 em 4 carboxylate, a cephalosporin antibiotic now generically known as ceftazidime.The reported synthesis of ceftazidime comprises reacting Z 2 2 tert. butoxycarbonylprop2 oxyimino 2 2 triphenylmethylaminothiazol 4 yl acetyl chloride with 6R,7R 7 amino 3 l pyridinium methyl ceph 3 em 4 carboxylic acid in a mixture of N,N dimethylacetamide and acetonitrile to provide the ceftazidime intermediate, 6R,7R 7 Z 2 2 tri phenylmethylaminothiazol 4 yl 2 2 tert. butoxyCar bonEtlprop 2 oxyimino acetamido 3 l pyridiniummethyl ceph 3 em 4 carboxylate. This ceftazidime intermediate then was recovered from the reaction mixture as an amorphous solid and subsequently purified by crystal lization as an N,N dimethylformamide solvate 2 1 2 moles of DMF per mole of intermediate from N,N di methylformamile. The ceftazidime intermediate then was reacted with formic acid to effect removal of the protecting groups and to provide ceftazidime. The present invention provides an improved process for preparing the ceftazidime intermediate, in which the intermediate is crystallized directly out of the reaction mixture as an N,N dimethylacetamide solvate.This invention, therefore, obviates the need for subsequent purification and provides improved yields and reduced costs in the production of ceftazidime In accordance with the invention, a compound of Formula I EMI2.1 in which DMAC is N,N dimethylacetamide and x is a number from 0.5 to 3.0, is a useful intermediate in the synthesis of ceftazidime. Also, there is provided a process for preparing a compound of Formula I , as defined above, which comprises reacting in N,N dimethylacetamide a Z 2 2 tert. butoxycarbonylprop 2 oxyimino 2 2 triphenylmethylamino thiazol 4 yl acetyl halide with a 6R,7R 7 amino 3 1 pyridiniummethyl ceph 3 em 4 carboxylic acid salt. The resulting dimethylacetamide solvate can be isolated as a crystalline solid directly from the reaction mixture. The process of this invention allows one to isolate, in good yield, substantially pure ceftazidime intermediateN, N dimethylacetamide solvate. As used throughout this description, ceftazidime intermediate means 6R,7R 7 Z 2 2 triphenylmethylaminothiazol 4 yl 2 2 tert. butoxy carbonylprop 2 oxyimino acetamido 3 1 pyridinium methyl ceph 3 em 4 carboxylate. The process by which this ceftazidime intermediate is prepared involves a typical acylation reaction comprising reacting a cephalosporin nucleus i.e. a 7 amino 3 cephem derivative with an acid halide, typically an acid chlorideThe acid halide typically employed in the synthesis of the ceftazidime intermediate is a Z 2 2 tert. butoxy carbonylprop 2 oxyimino 2 2 triphenylmethylamino thiazol 4 yl acetic acid halide.The acylation reaction generally is accomplished by reacting the acid halide with about an equimolar quantity of the 7amino 3 cephem nucleus in an unreactive solvent such as dichloromethane, acetone, or a mixture of N,N dimethyl acetamide and acetonitrile, and in the presence of a base such as triethylamine or pyridine. The present process is improved by employing N,N dimethylacetamide as the reaction solvent thereby producing the ceftazidime intermediate directly from the acylation reaction mixture as a crystalline N,N dimethylacetamide solvate.This improved process eliminates the separate purification step in which ceftazidime intermediate is converted to a solvate such as the N,N dimethylformamide solvate. In carrying out the process of this invention, the acid halide, for instance Z 2 2 tert. butoxycarbonylprop 2 oxyimino 2 2 triphenylmethyl aminothiazol 4 yl acetyl chloride, may be prepared by reaction of the free acid with a halogenating agent such as phosphorus pentachloride in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane or diethyl ether. Once the acid halide is formed, it normally is not isolated but rather is added to a suspension of about an equimolor quantity of the cephalosporin nucleus in N,N dimethylacetamide. A suitable base such as triethylamine is added to the reaction mixture to serve as scavenger for any free acid that might be present. The acylation reaction typically is complete within about fifteen to ninety minutes when carried out at a temperature of about 20 to about 400C.The ceftazidime intermediate that is thus produced is an N,N dimethylacetamide solvate of Formula I EMI5.1 in which DMAC is N,N dimethyiacetamide and x is a number from 0.5 to 3.0 and denotes the number of moles of DMAC per mole of ceftazidime intermediate.Preferred solvates are those in which x is about 0.5 to about 1.5, and especially in which x is 1.0. The ceftazidime intermediate solvate can be isolated readily if desired, by washing the reaction mixture with water and then adding a suitable counter solvent, i.e. a solvent in which the intermediate is substantially insoluble. Typical counter solvents include ethers, such as diethyl ether, methyl ethyl ether, diglyme, or tetrahydrofuran and esters such as ethyl acetate, or methyl acetate. The counter solvent of choice is diethyl ether, or a combination of diethyl ether and ethyl acetate. When the counter solvent is added to theN,N dimethylacetamide reaction mixture, the ceftazidime intermediate N,N dimethylacetamide solvate starts to precipitate within about thirty to about ninety minutes as the solution is stirred at about 10 to about 100C.The crystalline solvate is isolated by simply filtering themixture, and generally, washing the solvate with fresh N,N dimethylacetamide or diethyl ether is desirable. The product can be air dried at room temperature or dried in vacuum to remove any excess solvent. The product produced is an N,N dimethylacetamide solvate of ceftazidime intermediate having a purity generally greater than about ninety percent. The ceftazidime intermediate solvate provided by this invention may be employed directly to produce ceftazidime. For example, the crystalline solvate may be dissolved in an acid solution, such as 98 formic acid, to cleave the triphenylmethyl protecting group on the amino group attached to the thiazolylacetamido side chain, and also to cleave the tert. butoxy protecting group on the oxime portion of the side chain. If desired, hydrochloric acid can be added so as to form the dihydrochloride salt of ceftazidime, thereby facilitating isolation of the final product as a crystalline precipitate. The ceftazidime dihydrochloride produced can be employed as an antibiotic. To further illustrate the invention the following non limiting examples are provided. Example 1 6R,7R 7 Z 2 2 triphenylmethylamino thiazol 4 yl 2 2 tert. butoxycarbonylprop 2 oxy imino acetamido 3 1 pyridiniummethyl ceph 3 em 4 carboxylate.

The reaction mixture was then diluted by the addition of 80 ml of water containing 10.5 ml of triethylamine. After stirring the reaction mixture for three minutes, the organic layer was separated and the aqueous layer was discarded.The organic layer was then added dropwise over ten minutes to a cold 100C stirred suspension of 11.13 g of 6R,7R 7 amino 3 1 pyridiniummethyl ceph 3 em 4 carboxylic acid dihydrochloride in 88 ml ofN,N dimethylacetamide containing 17.5 ml of triethylamine. The reaction mixture was stirred for thirty minutes at about 5 to OOC, and then was allowed to warm to about 50C and was diluted by the addition of 200 ml of water. After stirring the aqueous mixture for two minutes, the organic layer was separated and the aqueous layer was discarded. The organic layer was further diluted with 200 ml of ethyl acetate and 100 ml of diethyl ether, and the mixture was vigorously stirred at about 20 to 250C, The mixture was seeded with ceftazidime intermediate N,N dimethylacetamide solvate to initiate crystallization.After stirring the mixture for thirty minutes at 20 to 250C, the temperature was lowered to OOC and stirring was continued for about two hours.
