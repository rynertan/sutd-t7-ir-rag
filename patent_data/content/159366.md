# Process for converting chlorinated hydrocarbons and metal oxides to oxides of carbon and metal chlorides.

## Abstract
A process is described for reacting chlorinated hydro carbons other than carbon tetrachloride with metal oxides so as to convert essentially all of the carbon atoms to oxides of carbon. This process provides an efficient and econom ical means for utilizing chlorinated hydrocarbons.
