# A TRANSDUCING DEVICE FOR INTERNAL CONTACTLESS ULTRASONIC INSPECTION OF PIPELINES OR TUBINGS

## Abstract
A transducing device for internal contactless ultrasonic inspection of pipelines or tubings comprising means for elec tromagnetically generating elastic waves within the wall of the pipeline or tubing to be inspected means for connecting mecha nically said device to a means for moving said device through the pipeline or tubing wherein said generating means comprises a magnetic means and at least one transmitting coil, said transmit ting coil being arranged on one of the poles of the said magnetic means and wherein, in use, the said poles of the magnetic means are directed to the wall of the pipeline or tubing under inspection.
