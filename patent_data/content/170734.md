# A SYSTEM FOR DETECTING SOLID OBSTACLES BETWEEN CONFRONTING SURFACES OF PRESSURE PLATES

## Abstract
This invention relates to plastic molding presses and other types of pressure plates 16, 10 , and more particularly to novel means by which to ensure against application of high closure pressure to the mold sections of a press when a solid impurity is on one of the confronting mold surfaces. This invention involves the passage of a gas under a predetermined superatmospheric pressure from an inlet opening 30 in the plane of the confronting surface of one of a pair of pressure plates 16 to an aligned outlet opening 40 in the plane of the confronting surface of the other of the pair of pressure plates 10 , and the detection of the air pressure in the outlet opening 40 , a drop in air pressure indicating that a solid obstacle or other impurity between the confronting surfaces has prevented closure of the pres sure plates 16, 10 .
