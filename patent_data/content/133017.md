# CARBURETION SYSTEM

## Abstract
A pressurized fuel carburetion system for internal com bustion engines wherein varying velocities and pressures are produced in the throat of the carburetor intermixing fuel with the air passing therethrough in such a manner to create a plurality of cortices containing air and fuel mixtures rotating about an axis substantially perpendicular to the carburetor air flow. The carburetor includes a rotating baffle and fuel dis tributor producing a restriction in the carburetor throat to cause high air flow velocities and low pressures and the air subsequently expands in such a manner as to produce low air flow velocities and higher pressures creating the desired vor tices. The fuel distributor is in the form of a rotating cup, and fuel supplied to the cup interior is projected transverse to the air flow immediately prior to the region of vortex generation. Fuel supply control means utilize a plurality of series related valves employing engine manifold pressure and throttle posi tion to control the rate of fuel supply and idling and accelera tion fuel requirements are controlled by appropriate valves.
