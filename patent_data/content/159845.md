## Description
SYNTHESIS OF CRYSTALLINE ZEOLITE This invention relates to a new way of synthesising a crystalline zeolite, to the use of the zeolite so synthesised as a catalyst for organic compound, e.g. hydrocarbon compound, conversion, and to the zeolite so synthesised. Zeolites have a crystal lattice which is a rigid three dimensional framework of SiO4, and frequently A104, tetrahedra cross linked by the sharing of oxygen atoms whereby the ratio of the total aluminum and silicon atoms to oxygen atoms is 1 2. The electrovalence of tetrahedra containing non tetravalent elements, such as aluminum, is balanced by the inclusion in the crystal of a cation, for example an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal cation.In the case of aluminosilicates the ratio of lattice aluminum atoms to cationic electrovalence bonds is thus unity. One cation may be exchanged for another, using ion exchange techniques in a conventional manner. By means of such cation exchange, it has been possible to vary the properties of a given aluminosilicate by suitable selection of the cation. The spaces between the tetrahedra are occupied by molecules of water prior to dehydration. A great variety of synthetic zeolites exists, designated by letter or other convenient symbols, as illustrated by zeolite A US A 2,882,243 , zeolite X US A 2,882,244 , zeolite Y US A 3,130,007 , zeolite ZK 5 US A 3,247,195 , zeolite SK 4 US A 3,314,752 , zeolite ZSM 5 US A 3,702,886 , zeolite ZSM US A 3,709,979 , zeolite Z5M 12 US A 3,832,449 , zeolite Z5M 20 US A 3,972,983 ,ZSM 35 US A 4,016,145 , ZSM 38 US A 4,046,859 , and zeolite 2SM 23 US A 4,076,842 . The Sio2 A1203 ratio of a aluminosilicate zeolite is often variable within limits. For example, zeolite X can be synthesised with 5iO2 A1203 ratios of from 2 to 3 zeolite y, from 3 to about 6. However in some zeolites the upper limit of SiO iA1203 ratio is unbounded. ZSM 5 is one such example wherein the Sio2 A1203 ratio is at least 5 and up to infinity. US A 3,941,871 discloses a crystalline silicate made from a reaction mixture containing no added alumina and exhibiting the x ray diffraction pattern characteristic of ZSM 5 type zeolites. US A 4,061,724, 4,073,865 and 4,104,294 describe crystalline silicates of varying alumina and metal content. The prior art techniques for synthesis of zeolites use reaction mixtures containing various organic directing agents. The directing agent is extremely important in such synthesis since it functions as a template in the nucleation and growth of the desired zeolite. Different directing agents direct nucleation and growthtof different zeolites from even similar reaction mixtures. Even with the same directing agent, however, different zeolites will form occasionally, depending upon such factors as reaction mixture composition. Still further, the crystallization conditions, such as temperature and time, may affect product type and quality. A zeolitic structure designated EU 1 in EP A42226 and TPZ 3 in EP A 51318 is shown to be synthesized in those Applications from a reaction mixture comprising a hexamethylene diammonium salt directing agent. An improved, reproducible, lower cost method for preparing a useful zeolite, over an unusually wide range of product aluminum content, exhibiting high purity, high crystallinity, catalytic activity and other valuable properties has now been found. The method comprises forming a reaction mixture containing sources of alkali metal oxide, an organic nitrogen containing cation, an oxide of aluminum, an oxide of silicon and water and having a composition, in terms of mole ratios, within the following ranges Broad Preferred SiO2 A1203 100 130H20 OH 70 500 80 400 OH SiO2 0.08 0.3 0.09 0.2M SiO2 0.08 0.3 0.09 0.2R Si02 0.05 1.0 0.08 0.5 wherein R is a cation derived from a dibenzyldimethylammonium compound and M is an alkali metal ion, and maintening tixtur until crystals of the zeolite are formed. The mole ratio of silica to alumina in the reaction mixture may be infinity or as close thereto as possible. The quantity of OH is calculated only from the inorganic sources of alkali without any organic base contribution. Reaction conditions required consist of heating the forging reaction mixture to a temperature of from about 8O0C.o about 1750C for a period of time of from about 24 hours to about 120 days.A more preferred temperature range is from about 1500C to about 1600C with the amount of time at a temperature in such range being from about 24 hours to about 8 days. Thereafter, the crystals are separated from the liquid and recovered. It has. also been found that the present method is even more cost efficient when the organic nitrogencontaining cation of the reaction mixture is created in sits. This is accomplished by adding to the reaction mixture, in place of the dibenzyldimethylammonium compound, a combination of dimethylbenzylamine and benzyl halide e.g. chloride, bromide or iodide , which form in situ the halide salt of dibenzyldimethylammonium. The digestion of the gel particles is carried out until crystals form. The solid product is separated from the reaction medium, as by cooling the whole to room temperature, filtering and water washing. The zeolite synthesised according to the invention manifests the x ray diffraction data set forth in Table 1 below. TABLE 1 Interplanar d spacing A Relative Intensity, I Io 20.1 .3 W 11.1 .17 S 10.1 .16 M 9.7 .14 W 5.77 .09 W 5.61 .09 W 4.64 .07 M 4.35 .07 M 4.30 .07 VS 4.00 .06 S 3.85 .06 M 3.70 .06 M 3.42 .05 W 3.35 .05 W 3.27 .05 M 3.24 .05 W 2.94 .04 W 2.53 .04 W These values were determined by standard techniques. The radiation was the K alpha doublet of copper and a diffractometer equipped with a scintillation counter and an associated computer was used. The peak heights, I, and the positions as a function of 2 theta, where theta is the Bragg angle, were determined using algorithms on the computer associated with the spectrometer.Prom these, the relative intensities, 100 1 1o, where 1o is the intensity of the strongest line or peak, and d orbs. the interplanar spacing in AngstromUnits A , corresponding to the recorded lines, were determined. In Table 1, the relative intensities are given in terms of the symbols W weak, M medium, S strong and VS very strong. m terms of intensities, these may be generally designated as follows W 0 20 n 20 40 S 40 60 VS 60 100 The zeolite synthesized in accordance with the present method exhibits high purity and high crystallinity and significantly enhanced catalytic activity for certain conversions of interest, including cracking and hydrocracking to make aromatic gasoline. It has a wider and higher silicaZalumina molar ratio range than previously proposed equivalent structures, allowing for tailoring of that ratio to suit specific purposes. The present method is reproducible, less costly, and easy to carry out. The particular effectiveness of the presently required different organic directing agent, i.e. the dibenzyldimethylammonium compound, when compared with other directing agents, such as those identified above, is believed due to its ability to function as a template in the nucleation and growth of the zeolite in high silica alumina ratio. This different organic directing agent functions in this fashion over an unusually wide range of reaction mixture aluminum contents. The dibenzyldimethylammonium compound may be, as non limiting examples, the hydroxide or the halide, e.g.chloride, bromide or iodide. Additional economies are realized if, instead of adding the dibenzyldimethylammonium compound to the reaction mixture, it is formed in situ by adding dimethylbenzylamine and benzyl halide e.g.chloride in combination. The molar ratio of dimethylbenzylamine to benzyl halide must be within the range of 0.8 to 1.0 in the reaction mixture, and preferably about 1.0. The in situ formation of the required directing agent saves relative synthesis time and cuts organic reagent costs by a factor of 40 to 100. In either event, a highly crystalline product is obtained. In the reaction mixture required of the present invention, the mole ratios of SiO2 A1203 and OH SiO2 are critical, as is the temperature X intained during crystallization. If the SiO2 A1203 mole ratio is below 100 and the O fSit2 mole ratio is above 0.3 a different zeolite forms as the predominant product. The reaction mixture composition can be prepared from materials which can supply the appropriate oxide.Such compositions include aluminates, alumina, silicates, silica hyjdrosol, silica gel, silicic acid and hydroxides.Each oxide component utilized in the reaction mixture can be supplied by one or more essential reactants and they can be mixed together in any order. For example, any oxide can be supplied by an aqueous solution, sodium hydroxide or by an aqueous solution of a suitable silicate the organic cation can be supplied by the directing agent compound of that cation, such as, for example, the hydroxide or a salt, e.g. halide, such as chloride or bromide. The reaction mixture can be prepared either batchwise or continuously.Crystal size and crystallization time will vary with the exact nature of the reaction mixture employed. The zeolite prepared hereby can be identified, in terms of mole ratios of oxides and in the anhydrous state, as follows 0 to l.O X2 nO O to l.O A1203 100 SiO2 wherein X is at least one cation having a valence n and may include cation derived from a dibenzyldimethylammonium compound. The original cations, e.g. alkali metal, can be replaced, at least in part, by calcination and or ion exchange with another cation. Thus, the cations of the assynthesised material may be exchanged with hydrogen or hydrogen ion precursors or with metals of Groups IIA, IIIA, IVA, IB, IIB, IIIB, IVB, VIB or VIII of the Periodic Table.Thus, for example, it is contemplated to exchange the original cations with ammonium ions or with hydronium ions.Catalytically active forms of these would include, in particular, hydrogen, rare earth metals, aluminum, metals of Groups II and VIII of the Periodic Table and manganese. While the improved crystalline silicate of the present invention may be used in a wide variety of organic compound, e.g. hydrocarbon compound, conversion reactions, it is notably useful in the processes of cracking and hydrocracking. It can be used either in the organicnitrogen containing and alkali metal containing form, the alkali metal form and hydrogen form or another univalent or multivalent cationic form. It can also be used in intimate combination with a hydrogenating component such as tungsten, vanadium, molybdenum, rhenium, nickel, cobalt, chromium, manganese, or a noble metal such as platinum or palladium where a hydrogenation dehydrogenation function is to be performed. Such components can be exchanged into the composition, impregnated therein or physically intimately admixed therewith.Such components can be impregnated by, in the case of platinum, treating the zeolite with a platinum metal containing ion. Suitable platinum compounds for this purpose include chloroplatinic acid, platinous chloride and various compounds containing the platinum amine complex. Combinations of metals and methods for their introduction can also be used. When exployed either as an adsorbent or as a catalyst in a hydrocarbon conversion process, the zeolite should be dehydrated at least partially. This can be done by heating to a temperature in the range of from about 2000C to about 6Q0 C in an inert atmosphere, such as air, nitrogen, etc. and at atmospheric or subatmospheric pressures for between 1 and 48 hours. Dehydration can also be performed at lower temperature merely by placing the zeolite in a vacuum, but a longer time is required to obtain a particular degree of dehydration. The thermal decomposition product of the freshly synthesized zeolite can be prepared by heating at a temperature up to about 550 C for from 1 hours to about 48 hours. The zeolite prepared in accordance herewith can have the original cations associated therewith replaced by a wide variety of other cations according to techniques well known in the art. Typical replacing cations include hydrogen, ammonium and metal cations including mixtures thereof. Qf the replacing metallic cations, particular preference is given to cations of metals such as rare earths, Mn, Ca, Mg, Zn, Cd, Pd, Ni, Cu, Ti,Al, Sn, Fe and Co. Typical ion exchange technique would be to contact the synthetic zeolite with a salt of the desired replacing cation or cations. Although a wide variety of salts can be employed, particular preference is given to chlorides, nitrates and sulfates. Following contact with the salt solution of the desired replacing cation, the zeolite is then preferably washed with water and dried at a temperature ranging from 650C to about 3150C and thereafter may be calcined in air or other inert gas at temperatures ranging from about 2000C to about 5500C for periods of time ranging from 1 to 48 hours or more to produce a catalytically active thermal decomposition product thereof. Regardless of the nature of the replacing cation the spatial arrangement of the aluminum, silicon and oxygen atoms which form the basic crystal lattice of the zeolite remains essentially unchanged. Catalysts containing the zeolite may be formed in a wide variety of particle sizes. Generally speaking, catalyst particles can be in the form of a powder, a granule, or a molded product, such as extrudate having particle size sufficient to pass through a 2 mesh Tyler screen and be retained on a 400 mesh Tyler screen. In cases where the catalyst is molded, such as by extrusion, it can be extruded before drying or dried or partially dried and then extruded. In the case of many catalysts, it is desired to composite a zeolite with another material resistant to the temperatures and other conditions employed in certain organic conversion processes. Such matrix materials include active and inactive materials, synthetic or naturally occurring, as well as inorganic materials such as clays, silica and or metal oxides, e.g. alumina. Suitable matrices are described in our EP A 1695. Employing a catalytically active form of a catalyst comprising the zeolite of this invention containing a hydrogenation component, reforming stocks can be reformed employing a temperature between 3700C and 540 C. The pressure can be between 100 and 1000 psig 7.9 to 70 bar , but is preferably between 200 and 700 psig 14.8 to 49.3 bar . The liquid hourly space velocity is generally between 0.1 and 10 hr l, preferably between 0.5 and 4 her 7 and the hydrogen to hydrocarbon mole ratio is generally between 1 and 20, preferably between 4 and 12. The catalyst can also be used for hydroisomerization of normal paraffins, when provided with a hydrogenation component, e.g. platinum. Hydroisomerization is carried out at a temperature between 900C to 3700C, preferably 1400C to 290 C, with a liquid hourly space velocity between 0.01 and 2 hr 1, preferably between 0.25 and 0.50 hr l, employing hydrogen such that the hydrogen to hydrocarbon mole ratio is between 1 and 5. Additionally, the catalyst can be used for oleo in or aromatics isomerization employing temperatures between OOC and 3700C. The catalyst can also be used for reducing the pour point of gas oils. This process is carried out at a liquid hourly space velocity between about 10 and about 30 hr l and a temperature between about 4000C and 540 C. Other reactions which can be accomplished employing the catalyst of this invention containing a metal, e.g. platinum, include hydrogenation dehydrogenation reactions and desulfurization reactions, olefin polymerization oligomerization , and other organic compound conversions such as the conversion of alcohols e.g. methanol to hydrocarbons. In the following examples, which illustrate the invention, whenever adsorption data are set forth for comparison of sorptive capacities for water, cyclohexane and n hexane, they were determined as follows A weighed sample of the calcined adsorbant was contacted with the desired pure adsorbate vapor in an adorption chamber, evacuated to 1 mm and contacted with 12 mm Hg of water vapor or 40 mm Hg of n hexane, or cyclohexane vapor, pressures less than the vapor liquid equilibrium pressure of the respective adsorbate at room temperature. The pressure was kept constant within about 0.5 mm by addition of adsorbate vapor controlled by a monostat during the adsorption period, which did not exceed about 8 hours.As adsorbate was adsorbed by the sorbant material, the decrease in pressure caused the monostat to open a valve which admitted more adsorbate vapor to the chamber to restore the above control pressures. Sorption was complete when the pressure change was not sufficient to activate the monostat. The increase in weight was calculated as the adsorption capacity of the sample in g 100 g of calcined adsorbant.
