# Method and apparatus for the heat processing of particulate materials.

## Abstract
A vortex combustion furnace 1 for the production of glass beads or the like is generally cylindrical and has an outlet flue 24 at its upper end. A burner 13 at the lower end burns a gas air mixture. Secondary air is introduced into the chamber through tangential air nets 16 and creates a vortex within the chamber. Tertiary air is introduced through a ring of angled nozzles 71 surrounding the burner further to swirl the flame. The vortex has a top hat temperature profile with a central heating region with a temperature in excess of 1000 C and a surrounding cooling region with a temperature not much above ambient. Glass cullet is supplied to a fluidized bed 53 and thence entrained in a pipe 44 to be injected into the chamber. The cullet follows a spiral path in the vortex, is heated, melts to form glass beads, is then cooled and finally is collected after striking the wall of the chamber.
