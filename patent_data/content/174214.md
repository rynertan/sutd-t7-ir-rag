## Abstract
A gripper arm includes jaw members 24,26 between which articles are engaged and from which engaged articles are released in precise placement upon a transport means. Jaw 26 is actuated by solenoid actuating means 28 acting through linkage means 30 to perform the engagement and release operations. The activation of the solenoid actuating means 28 is controlled to be dependent upon the operating speed of a machine in conjunction with which the gripper arm is used. Field generating means 420 is mounted on one jaw member while a sensor 400 is connected on the other jaw member. The sensed flux density of the generated field is a function of the relative displacement of the first and second jaw members 24,26 . The signal generated by the sensor 400 is accordingly related to the separation of the first jaw member 24 and second jaw member 26 . If the sensor generated signal is within predetermined limits of a stored reference signal a proper number of articles are engaged between the first and second jaw members 24,26 .
