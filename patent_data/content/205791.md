# Multiple layer positron emission tomography camera.

## Abstract
A position emission tomography camera having a pa tient area 18 with a plurality of fixed detector rings 14, 14a positioned side by side around the patient area to detect radiation. Each ring contains a plurality of scintillation de tectors directed toward the patient area for defining a plane slice. Each ring includes multiple layers of scintillation de tectors in which the detectors in one of the layers is offset relative to the detectors in the other layers in a ring for increasing the sampling of detected radiation. Photo multi pliers for converting detected radiation into electrical pulses are positioned adjacent each ring but offset from the plane of each ring and are directed perpendicularly to the plane of the adjacent ring. The depth of each ring is suf ficient to stop gamma radiation but the depth of each layer is less whereby image resolution is improved.
