## Description
This invention relates to recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid which codes for plasminogen activator and a method of making plasminogen activator protein therefrom. Acute thromboembolic events, venous and arterial thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, intracardiac thrombosis and systemic embolism are difficult to manage. Current medical therapy for the occlusion itself commonly involves anticoagulation. The current medical approach is designed to stop the underlying process and to rely on normal physiologic mechanisms for restoring blood flow and limiting the extent of vascular obstruction or destruction of tissue. Thrombolysis or thrombolytic therapy would be of considerable interest as a means for lysing the offending thromboembolism. By using both anticoagulation and thrombolytic therapy, medical practice would have the means to dissolve thromboemboli quickly and prevent their recurrence. Recently, several approaches to thrombolytic therapy have been under investigation, one being through the systemic infusion of activators of the naturally occurring fibrinolytic enzyme system. One such agent which has undergone extensive study is urokinase. Urokinase is a thrombolytic agent active through the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. Plasminogen is the naturally occurring plasma precursor which, in the presence of an activator, is converted to plasmin, the proteolytic enzyme capable of hydrolyzing fibrin. Urokinase is a complex protein of unknown structure which is found in human urine in trace amounts. It is a potent blood clot lysing agent and when injected in amounts far greater than those which exist naturally in the blood will promote the dissolution of blood clots. It was first described in 1951 after which processes for the isolation and purification of urokinase from human urine were developed. Methods for the isolation and purification of urokinase are described in many publications, such as U.S. Patents 2,983,647 3,256,158 3,477,910 to 913 and 3,544,427. However, the logistics of urine collection and processing makes this source of urokinase impractical, four million CTA Committee on Thrombolytic Agents units of urokinase requiring the processing of about 1,500 liters of urine. Fibrinolytic activity in cultures of human kidney cells was later demonstrated, and it was found that this activity was immunologically indistinguishable from urinary urokinase. Even using tissue culture processes, high production costs result, and, consequently, other methods for the preparation of urokinase are desirable. The present invention relates to a plasminogen activator protein which shows fibrinolytic activity and which is recognised by antibodies to human urokinase, this protein being producible in E. coli transformed with a plasmid vector into which a polydeoxyribonucleotide segment which codes for said protein has been inserted. Said modified plasmid can be introduced into E. coli. which can then be cultured to produce urokinase like material in the same manner as the manufacture of antibiotic compounds. The modified plasmid was obtained by direct manipulation of nucleotide sequences in the plasmid. For purposes of description, the invention will be described with reference to the bacterium The new technique of manipulation of nucleotide sequences permits deliberate introduction of known or identified nucleotide sequences from one strain or species into another thereby conferring a desired property. With reference to the double helix structure of DNA, both of the interwound and complementary strands of the DNA molecule are made up of four deoxyribonucleotides deoxyriboadenosine 5 phosphate dAMP , thymidine 5 phosphate TMP , deoxy riboguanosine 5 phosphate dGMP and deoxyribocytidine 5 phosphate dCMP , which are linked through the phosphate groups. The genetic message of each strand is embodied in the particular sequence of deoxyribonucleotides. The sequence of nucleotides in a given DNA molecule determines the sequence of amino acids in a particular protein and the sequence of amino acids in turn specifically establishes both the structure and function of the protein. Hence, the nucleotide sequence of DNA precisely specifies the protein building properties of the organism. The recombinant DNA procedure begins with cleavage of the strands of DNA by proteins known as restriction endonuclease enzymes which are isolated from bacteria. The enzymes break the chain of DNA at particular sequences. The break does not always occur at the same point on two strands so that separate strands may have complementary ends and hence under suitable conditions will bind together so that they can be coupled end to end. If the same restriction enzyme is used on the DNA from two different sources, both of which have the appropriate target sequence, then sequences with ends which will bind will result. Hence, two sequences from any source can be recombined into a single DNA molecule. Another way of obtaining DNA for insertion is to reverse transcribe messenger RNA into double stranded complementary DNA. The synthesized DNA then can be inserted into a plasmid as described hereinafter. This method of obtaining DNA is preferred since genes of mammalian chromosomal DNA often contain sequences not coding for protein, thus interrupting the colineality of genetic information transfer from DNA to protein. In a bacterium such as The invention will be better understood with reference to the accompanying drawing in which Plasmids are believed to consist of double stranded DNA molecules and to include at least one replication site. The E. coli plasmid or vector pBR322 is described by Bolivar, The recombinant DNA, namely the restructured plasmid containing DNA which codes for urokinase like material, is returned into a suitable host organism which as exemplified is The present method thus provides a bacterium from the genus, Total mRNA from urokinase producing cells was isolated as follows Human embryo kidney HEK cells were grown in tissue culture to confluency in 7 10 days in Eagle s medium E199 with 10 percent fetal calf serum. The cells were maintained in a protein hydrolysate medium without serum for an additional 7 days before harvest. HEK cells were scraped off the roller bottles, washed in saline containing heparin 10 units ml and total RNA was isolated by the guanidine thiocyanate method of Ullrich The cell free protein synthesizing system from rabbit reticulocytes was nuclease treated to deplete endogenous mRNA according to the method of Pelhem and Jackson Immunoprecipitation of synthesized ³⁵S peptides was performed as described by Rhodes, Cell free protein synthesis dependent on added mRNA was also carried out in the wheat germ system as described by Roberts and Peterson Single stranded cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription of mRNA according to the method of Friedman and Rosbash The second strand of the cDNA was synthesized by using the large fragment of DNA Polymerase I from The double stranded cDNA mentioned above was then treated with S₁ nuclease 1250 units for three hours at 15 C in the presence of 30 mM sodium acetate pH 4.6, 1 mM ZnSO₄, 250 mM NaCl and 100 ug ml of Addition of homopolymer tracts to the double stranded cDNA was carried out without the use of exonuclease as described by Roychoudhury, From approximately 20 pmoles in 3 OH ends in the double stranded cDNA, 1400 pmoles of 32p dCMP were incorporated. This accounted for an addition of 70 dCMP residues added per DNA strand. The linear plasmid DNA was obtained as follows The reaction mixture 100 ul contained 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mM MgCl₂, 10 mM DTT, 50 mM NaCl, 10 ug of pBR322 DNA and 5 units of Pst I. After 20 hrs. at 37 C, an aliquot 5 ul of the reaction mixture was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to check for completeness of digestion. The linear DNA was then phenol extracted and isolated by ethanol precipitation. The DNA was suspended in 100 ul of 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mM EDTA and incubated in terminal transferase buffer as described above containing 100 uM ³H dTTP and 240 units of terminal transferase. At intervals of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 min. at 42 C, aliquots 5ul were monitored for acid insoluble radioactivity. The remaining solution after 5 min. of incubation was phenol extracted and ethanol precipitated. During this period a total of 130 pmoles of dGMP residues were incorporated. To the DNA sample containing 5.4 pmoles of 3 OH ends, an average of 24 residues were added per strand of pBR322 DNA. The large double stranded cDNA tailed with polydeoxycitydilic acid poly dC about 0.15 pmole was annealed to an equivalent amount of the polydeoxyguanilydic acid poly dG tailed pBR322 DNA in 0.1 M NaCl in a 100 ul volume. The mixture was heated to 65 C for 3 min. and left at 42 C for 16 hours to anneal the DNA preparations. The procedure of Curtiss A total of 32 tetracycline resistant transformants were obtained. Of these, four were ampicillin sensitive AMP Ampicillin sensitive, tetracycline resistant The cell lysate was prepared according to Seeburg When the cell lysate from Transformant X1776 pABB26 was passed through the benzamidine affinity column, some A₂₈₀ material from the lysate was retained in the column and eluted only by low pH and high salt. These retained materials showed positive reaction in the solid phase RIA for urokinase, whereas the control lysate from transformant X1776 pBR322 was negative Fig. 1 . The products were further characterized for their molecular sizes by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by filteraffinity transfer J. Biol. Chem. 254, 12240, 1979 onto cyanogen bromide activated paper. ¹²⁵I labelled urokinase specific antibody revealed five discrete sizes of plasminogen activator protein with approximate molecular weights of 32,000, 52,000, 87,000, 124,000 and 154,000. Plasminogen activator activity was measured using a sensitive ¹²⁵I fibrinolysis assay modified from Unkeless When urokinase affinity column eluates of transformant X1776 pABB26 were tested using this assay, significant fibrinolytic activity was detected whereas samples from X1776 transformed with pBR322 showed no such activity. Furthermore, immune precipitation with antisera specific for human urokinase was capable of removing this activity from solution providing confirmation of the immunochemical relatedness of plasminogen activator activity from transformant X1776 pABB26 and human urokinase see Table 1 .
