# Water engine.

## Abstract
A water engine comprises a float 1 arranged for reciprocal movement in a chamber 2 under the action of a head of water. The chamber 2 is filled with water from an upper level 16 by means of a valve 11 and is emptied to a lower level 17 by means of a further valve 10 . A cross head 5 is mounted atop the float 1 and two pairs of hydraulic rams 6 and 7 are pivotably connected to the cross head 5 . The pairs of rams 6 and 7 are also pivotably connected to pairs of sliders 14 and 15 which are adjustably mounted on stanchions 18 . When the float 1 is caused to rise, hydraulic fluid in the upper pair of rams 7 is pressurised because of the shortening of the rams 7 , whilst hydraulic fluid is drawn into the lower pair of rams 6 by extension thereof. When the float 1 is caused to fall, the opposite is true. Each pair of rams 6 and 7 pivots as the float 1 moves, the arrangement being such that for whichever pair of rams 6 or 7 is on its working stroke there is progressively less shortening of that pair of rams 6 or 7 per unit travel of the float 1 .
