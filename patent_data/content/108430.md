# Continuous excavating apparatus.

## Abstract
Excavating buckets 74 with teeth 76 are joined by hinge pins 68 which connect interdigititated hinge parts 70 and 72 on adjacent buckets to form a piano hinge. The pins 68 have enlarged ends for engagement with the teeth of driving sprockets 60 driven by hydraulic motors 80, 82 , through shaft 30 . The ends of the pins 68 roll on the sprockets, thus reducing wear, and the conequent rotation of the pins in the hinges equalizes wear and maintains round ness.
