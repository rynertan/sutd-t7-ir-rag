More specifically, the development of resistance to pesticides has been recognized in many kinds of leafhoppers e.g., Nephotettix apicalis cincticeps , mites and aphides. In addition, the development of resiscance in hygienically noxious insects such as flies e.g., Musca donestica vicina and mosquitoes has Become a serious problem because it makes their control more and more difficult. Accordingly, there is a strong demand for insecticidal and miticidal agents which are effect tive against such resistant insects and mites.It is an object of this invention to provide an insecticidal and miticidal composition which can effectively control such insects and mites as are resistant to conventional insecticidal and miticidal agents.In accordance with this invention, an insecticidal and miticidal composition comprises a 2 dimethylamino 5,6 dimethylpyimi din 4 yl dimethylcarbamate hereinafter referred to as Compound A b at least one compound selected from the group consisting of organic phosphorus compounds, methylcarbamate compounds, and pyrethroid compounds and c an inert carrier. The present inventors have found that mixtures ofCompound A and at least one organic phosphorus compound, methylcarbamate compound, or pyrethroid compound have a very potent synergistic effect in controlling various kinds of ver mjn such as leafhoppers and mites which are resistant to conventional insecticidal and miticidal agents. This is quite surprising because Ccmpound A, which has so far been known as an inscticide for aphids, only, is chemically called a pyrimidine carbamate as distinguished from phenylcarbamates and the like and hence considerered to be ineffective against vermin other than aphides. In the composition of this invention, Compound A is preferably present in an amount of form 10 to 90 by weight, more preferably from 30 to 70 by weight,. and most preferably 5n 8 by weight, based on the combined weight of all the active in gredients.The composition of this invention may be prepared in the form of a dust, wettable powder, emulsion or granules by mixingCompound A and at least one organic phosphorus compound, methylcarbamate compound, or pyrethroid compound with various wellknown solid or liquid carriers or by dissolving those active ingredients jal suitable solvents. The combined amount of all the active ingredients present in this composition is preferably at least 1 by weight, and more preferably from 2 to 70 by weight, based on the total amount of the composition . More specifically, depending on the form of the composition, the preferred range of the combined amount of all active ingredients varies as follows Dust...From 2 to 5 by weightWettable powder ... From 40 to 70 by weightGranules ...From 3 to 6 by weightEmulsion ... rrom 20 to 50 by weightThe composition of this invention is preferably applied to a paddy or upland field in such a way that the active ingredients are deposited in a combined amount of from 1 to 50 g, more preferably from 4 to 30 g, and most preferably from 10 to 16 g, per are of the field. For use in mechanized planting of young rice plants and the like, the composition of this invention is conveniently prepared in the form of granules, though it may be used in the form of an emulsion, wettable powder, or dust. In such a case, the composition of this invention is preferably applied so that the active ingredients are deposited in a combined amount of from 1 to 20 g per are of the field. Specific examples of the insects and mites which can be controlled by the composition of this invention are as follows Hemiptera Nephotettix apicalis cincticeps llkler Sogatella furcifera Horvath Nilaparvata lugens Stal Laoderphax striatellus FallonThysanoptera Thrips oryzae Williams Thrips tabaci Lindeman tnoplura Pediculus humanus Linne Haematopinus eurysternus Nitzah Lepidoptera Chilo suppressalis Walker Spodoptera litura Fabricius Pieris ratae crucivora Boisduval Plutella xylostella LinnéDiptera Musca domestica vicina Macquart Culex pipiens pallens CoquillettColeoDtera Epilachna sparsa orientalis Dieke Callosobruchus chinesis Linné Lema orizae Kuwayama Aulacophora femoralis Motschulsky Hymenoptera Arge pagana Panzer Athalia japonensis RohwerOrthoptera Locust a migratoria danica Linn Oxya japonica Willemse Phyllodromia germanica Linné Periplaneta japonica KarnyAcarina Tetranychus urticae Koch Tetranychus telarius Linné Tetranychus kanzawai Kishida Panonychus ulmi Panonychus citri Boochilus annulatus Thus, the comrosition of this invention permit almost complete destruction of such insects and mites as are resistant to various conventional insecticidal and miticidal agents and hence very hard to control. This invention will be more fully understood by reference to the following examples in which a number of compositions were prepared in accordance with the invention and tested for their insecticidal and miticidal activities. However, these examples are intended .zzerely to illustrate the practice of the invention and are not to be construed to limit the scope of the invention.

A piece of absorbent cotton was placed in a petri dish of 5 cm diameter and soaked with water. Leaf discs of a kedney bean plant were stamped out by means of a cork borer and placed on the absorbent cotton.Each disc was inoculated with 10 mites and then sprayed uniformly with 1.0 ml of a solution containing each test material. The petri dish was allowed to sand for 24 hours in a room kept at 2500 and then examined for the death rate of the mites by means of a stereoscopic microscope.
