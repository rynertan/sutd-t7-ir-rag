## Description
The present invention provides novel compounds, synthesis, pharmaceutical compositions and uses of the compounds, particularly as antipsychotic agents. Numerous examples of aminoalkoxybenzopyranones are known. For example, in US Patent No. 4,428,955, Boehringer discloses compounds of general Formula III for use in the treatment of allergies. Compounds including those, generally, of Formula IV shown in US Patent No. 4,320,128 are for use as antihypertensives and in US Patent No. 3,098,854, Chem. Pharm. Fabrik describes compounds of Formula V having use as vasodilators. However, none of the aminoalkoxybenzopyranones described in the noted US Patents suggest the combinations of structural variations of the compounds of the present invention described hereinafter. Particularly, an antipsychotic use for the above disclosed compounds is not within the teachings of the patents noted. Copending US Application SN 651,972 discloses benzopyran 2 ones for antipsychotic use. The present invention of benzopyran 4 one derivatives is not suggested by such previously disclosed compounds. The present invention is a compound of Formula I wherein X is oxygen or sulfur R is A or B wherein The novel compounds of Formula I are named as benzopyranones or benzothiopyranones by virtue of a fused ring system having a carbonyl group in the heterocyclic ring portion of the fused ring. The heterocyclic fused ring system is numbered counterclockwise starting with X as depicted in Formula VI. By virtue of the carbonyl group at the four position these compounds are called benzopyran 4 ones when X is oxygen and benzothiopyran 4 ones when X is sulfur. Additionally, the present invention is a process for the preparation of a compound of Formula I as defined above which comprises reacting a compound of Formula II, wherein Hal is halogen and X is oxygen or sulfur with an amine having the Formula HA or HB wherein A or B is as defined above see Scheme I . Also the process of the present invention is the preparation of the compound of Formula II₁ which comprises reacting a compound of Formula VII with 1 bromo 3 halopropane or other appropriately substituted alkane in the presence of anhydrous K₂CO₃. The compounds of Formula II₂ can be prepared in a similar manner from a compound of Formula VIII see Scheme II . On the other hand, the process of the present invention includes the preparation of the compound of Formula II₃ which comprises 1 reacting 2,6 dihydroxyyacetophenone, 1 bromo 3 chloropropane or appropriately substituted alkane, and potassium carbonate to obtain a compound of Formula IX, then 2 treating the product of step 1 with sodium metal and ethyl formate, and finally 3 the product of step 2 is treated with HCl in ethanol to obtain the compound of Formula II₃ see Scheme III . The present invention is also a pharmaceutical composition comprising an amount effective for the treatment of psychosis, such as schizophrenia, of a compound of the Formula I defined above or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof, in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Further, the present invention is a method of treating psychosis which comprises administering to humans, exhibiting psychotic symptoms, an effective amount of the compound I as defined above or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Antipsychotic activity is determined by standard laboratory means. All compounds shown in the following Table 1 are active in laboratory tests that have been useful as predictors of antipsychotic efficacy e.g., treatment of schizophrenia . Among these tests described by J.R. McLean, R.B. Parker, and L.L. Coughenour in Further study of these compounds indicates that their mechanism of action involves the selective activation of presynaptic dopamine receptors in the brain of animals. Thus, they show in vitro affinities for the dopamine receptor in the 10 ⁶ 10 ⁷ molar range, as measured by the inhibition of ³H haloperidol binding. See D.R. Burt, I. Creese, and S.H. Snyder, Analogs of compounds of Formula I were prepared and were found to be inactive in the McLean et al test described above. For example, an aminoalkoxybenzopyranone incorporating a dialkylaminopropoxy side chain was prepared as an example of the type of structure V, which is claimed by Chem. Pharm. Fabrik US 3,098,854 noted above as vasodilator. Equally, an aminoalkoxybenzopyranone was prepared as an example of structure III, claimed by Boehringer US 4,428,955 for the treatment of allergies. In both instances, the structural features of these compounds are inappropriate for the desired dopaminergic activity. These compounds are active in animal tests which are predictive of neuroleptic activity for the treatment of subjects exhibiting the symptoms of major psychoses such as schizophrenia. Regardless of the route of administration selected, the compounds of the present invention are formulated into pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms by conventional methods known to the pharmaceutical art. In general a preferred method of administration is, however, by oral dosage forms. The compounds can be administered in such unit oral dosage forms as tablets, capsules, pills, powders, or granules. They may also be administered rectally, vaginally in such forms as suppositories or bougies. They may also be introduced parenterally, e.g., subcutaneously, intravenously, or intramuscularly , using forms known to the pharmaceutical art. An effective but nontoxic quantity of the compound of Formula I or the salts thereof is employed in treatment. The dosage regimen for treating psychosis by the compounds of this invention is selected in accordance with a variety of factors including the type, age, weight, sex, and medical condition of the subject, the severity of the psychosis, the route of administration, and the particular compound employed. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the art. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day if desired. Initial dosages of the compounds of the invention are ordinarily in the area of 1 mg kg up to at least 100 mg kg per dose orally, preferably 1 to 50 mg kg orally are given. Each dose is given from one to four times daily or as needed. When other forms of administration are employed equivalent doses are administered. The compounds of this invention can also be administered as pharmacologically acceptable acid addition salts such as the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, sulfate, phosphate, acetate, propionate, lactate, maleate, malate, succinate, tartrate, cyclohexanesulfamates, methansulfonates, ethanesulfonates, benzenesulfonates, toluenesulfonates and the like. Additionally, the compounds of this invention may be administered in a suitable hydrated or solvent form. The following Table 1 shows novel compounds of Formula I and their activity for use as described above. Certain compounds within the scope of Formula I are preferred, since they have a more advantageous pharmacologic effect. Thus, the compounds of the Formula I having the O CH₂ Among the most preferred are 7 3 4 phenyl 1,2,3,6 tetrahydro 1 pyridyl propoxy 4 Examples of CH₂ Ar as used in the description of the present invention means a phenyl, b phenyl substituted, for example, by from one to three substituents such as alkyl of from one to six carbons, inclusive alkoxy of from one to six carbons, inclusive halogen or c Het wherein Het is 2 , 3 , or 4 pyridinyl or 2 , 3 , or 4 pyridinyl substituted by alkyl of from one to six carbons, inclusive, alkoxy of from one to six carbons, inclusive, or halogen 2 , 4 , or 5 pyrimidinyl or 2 , 4 , or 5 pyrimidinyl substituted by alkyl of from one to six carbons, inclusive, alkoxy of from one to six carbons, inclusive, or halogen 2 pyrazinyl or 2 pyrazinyl substituted by alkyl of from one to six carbons, inclusive, alkoxy of from one to six carbons, inclusive or halogen 2 or 3 thienyl or 2 or 3 thienyl substituted by alkyl of from one to six carbons, inclusive 2 or 3 furanyl or 2 or 3 furanyl substituted by alkyl of from one to six carbons, inclusive, or halogen or 2 or 5 thiazolyl or 2 or 5 thiazolyl substituted by alkyl of from one to six carbons, inclusive, or halogen.
