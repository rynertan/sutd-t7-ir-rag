# Electronic controller of hydraulic pressure for journal loading of bowl mill.

## Abstract
An electronic system particularly suited for effecting control over the pressure of the hydraulic fluid through which the journal loading is established on the grindling rolls 20 of a bowl mill 10 of the type that is employed to pulverize coal. The subject electronic system is operatively connected in circuit relation to the belt feeder means 12 , located externally of the bowl mill 10 , that supplies to the bowl mill 10 the coal that is to be pulverized therein. In addition, the subject electronic system is also operatively connected in circuit relation to the hydraulic power unit 22 of the bowl mill 10 that provides hydraulic fluid under pressure to the grinding rolls 20 . Accordingly, the subject electronic system is operative to monitor both the rate at which coal is fed to the bowl mill 10 and the pressure of the hydraulic fluid supplied to the grinding rolls 20 such that as the feed rate of the coal varies the hydraulic pressure being applied to the grinding rolls 20 can be made to vary so that the grinding forces that the grinding rolls 20 exert can be maintained substantially as an optimum regardless of the rate at which the coal is being fed to the bowl mill 10 .
