# A block brake actuator for a rail vehicle.

## Abstract
A rail vehicle block brake actuator 1 shall be fixedly mounted, but its brake block holder 4 shall brakingly engage an axially movable wheel 25 . For this purpose the brake block holder is laterally movably suspended relative to the brake actuator by means of pivotable hangers 5 each consisting of a stack of leaf springs. These leaf springs 5 are preferably prestressed in a direction for compensating for the bias of the taper of the wheel tread, which it is intended to engage, but are held in a straight condition by means of a flat bar 9 .
