## Description
Dishwashing machine with alternated supply of the rotating collectors The present invention relates to a dishwashing machine comprising a programmer, water pumping means including an electric motor, a number of inlet pipes, a wash chamber and at least two rotating collectors fitted in the wash chamber and alternately supplied. One of the main problems related to dishwashing machines is how to cut down the energy consumption and to that end certain types of dishwashing machines with more than one wash basket provide for supplying alternately the two rotating collectors. In this way, without impairing the device efficiency for a given wash cycle, the amount of water required for wash steps is smaller and a less powerful wash pump can be used, reducing electricity consumption both for operating the pump motor and heating the water. A number of devices are also known to alternately supply the two rotating collectors mentioned above, but they all present the same drawback of having to be controlled from outside the inlet pipes, raising the obvious problem of sealing said pipes to withstand the internal pressure exerted by the water at the point where the control device comes out. A further drawback is caused by the seizing up or jammin of he control device caused by food waste and scale in the water in the form of iet.itjs. During the wash operation, these matters et inside the sealing points so as to cause the said seizing up the water is drained off and the inside part of the appliance dry off. Moreover, a functional complication tile said devices usually cause is that the control device is generally driven by an additional electric motor or electromagnet. It is also known see patent US A 4.004.600 by Corn the use of devices presenting two centrifugal impellers splined to the same shaft of an electric motor. In said embodiment a one direction electric motor is used and the two centrifugal impellers are placed at different heights, consequently according to the quantity of water present in the tank both the impellers or only the lower one work. In this way in the standard device cycle both the spray nozzles are supplied, whereas in the economy wash cycle only the lower spray arm is feeded. The quantity of water present in the tank is determined by the dishwashing machine timer depending if the wash cycle choosen is standard or economy, so that according to said choice both the spray nozzles work at the same time during the standard cycle or only the lower one during the economy cycle.It is also known see patent US A 3.179.307 by Duncan the use of a reversible electric motor with two impellers, one for the water nlet in the wash tank when the motor turns in a first direction of rotation and the other for the wash water outlet when the motor turns in a second direction of rotation. U.owever both these devices do not give any teachIng how to solve the problem of the alternated supply of the lower rotating collector and of the upper rctating collector during the same wash cycle in order to reduce the quantity of water present in the tan nd consequently the consumptions for all the wesh cycles. Thus aim of the present invention is to overcome the ab drawbacks and to show a dischwashing machine embodying the alternated supply of the rotating collectors during a wash cycle, without the help of any device external as to the water supply pipes , and which is very simple and reliable. ith these aims in view the present invention relates to a dishwashing machine including a programmer, means for water pumping including an electric motor, a number of inlet pipes, a wash chamber and at least two rotating collectors inside the wash chamber and alternately supplied, characterized in that said alternated supply of the rotating collectors during a wash cycle is obtained by said water pumping means without adding any other devices. Further aims and advantages of the present invention will be clear from the following detailed description and the attached drawings, provided by way of an explanatory and non limiting example, in which figure 1 shows a cross section of the dishwashing machine subject of the present invention figure 2a shows a cross section and figures 2b and 2c two orthogonal projections of a variation of the present invention, figure 3 shows an axial section of the variation shown in figure 2 and figure 4 shows an axial section, 900 turned as to the section of figure 3, of the variation shown in figure 2. With reference to fig.l, it shows a sump 1 of a dishwashing machine, separated from the wash chamber not visible in the figure by means of a filter 2, in which the wash water is stored, and having at its bottom an outlet 3 which ramifies in a first pipe 4 and second pipe 5. The first pipe 4 ends in an inlet 6 of an upper pressure chamber 7, which has also a lateral outlet 8, whereas the second 5 5 ends in an inlet 9 of a lower pressure chamber 10, which has also a lateral outlet 11. Pressure chamLers 7 and 9 are superimposed ani communicating and have their two inlets 6 and 9 in their lower central side, while from their lateral outlets 8 and 11 ramify two connecting pipes 12 and 13, from which the water flows respectively to the two rotating collectors of the dishwashing machine, not visible in the figure. Connecting pipe 12 for example can supply the upper rotating collector, while connecting pipe 13 can supply the lower rotating collector. Inside the upper pressure chamber 7 it is fitted an upper centrifugal impeller 14 and inside the lower pressure chamber 9 it is fitted a lower centrifugal impeller 15. The paddles of the two centrifugal impellers are directed toward opposite directions, both are downwardly directed and are splined coaxially on the same shaft 16 of an electric motor 17, commanded by a programmer 18 of the dishwashing machine. The electric motor 17 is placed laterally to sump 1, the shaft 16 of which is downwardly directed, and is fastened to the same sump 1 in a known way. TElile functioning, the motor 17 is commanded by the programmer 18 of the dishwashing machine, which decides , according to the programme chosen by the user, when, how long and in which direction it must turn. It is obvious that when two centrifugal impellers with their opposite directed and integrally connected paddles rotate in opposite directions, only one at a time is working since the impeller, which rotates in the direction opposite to the paddles direction, is idle because it does not create any pressure in the inlet pipe. moreover it must be rerembered that a number of pipes suitable to allow the air in, ease the dispriring of the active . centrifugal impeller when the reversal of the motion of rotation occ ConseQently, when the direction of rotation of the electric motor 17 is reversed, also the centrifugal impeller , which pumps water, is changed for example when the electric motor 17 turns clockwise, the upper centrifugal impeller 14 works and the water is pumped to the upper rotating collector, but when the electric motor 17 turns counterclockwise it is the lower centrifugal impeller 15 that works and the water is pumped to the lower rotating collector. In this way, by means only of the programmer 18 command, which is consequently planned and built to carry out such inversion at the desired intervals, the direction of rotation of the electric motor 17 is reversed, and as a consequence the desired alternation in the supply of the two rotating collectors is obtained without any auxiliary device external to the water inlet pipes from sump 1 to the rotating collectors. With reference to figures 2a, 2b and 2c, which show a variation to the alternated supply device as shown in the previous figure, we can see an impeller 21 consisting of a single piece with a hole 22 in the middle, across which said impeller is splined to the shaft 16 of the electric motor i7, an upper section 23 consisting of a number of radial blades 24, that can be seen better in the top view showed in figure 2c , a lower section 25 including a number of helical blades 26, that can be seen better in the bottom view shown in figure 2b . The upper section 23 of the impeller 21 includes also a first protruding collar 27, a second one 28 and a third one 29 whose function will be better explained afterwards.The lower section 25 of the impeller 21 is fundamentally represented by a flat ring 30 placed under helical blades 26, said flat ring 30 having also a hole 31 in its middle part for the wash water inlet. From figure 3, in which the same particulars of figure 2 are indicated using the same numbers, we can see that the impeller 21 is placed inside a space between a sump 32 and a cover 33, both having a nunber of clearance holes 34 and 35 which permit to connect them by means of screws or nuts and bolts not visible in the figure in order to form the envelope of the impeller 21. The cover 33, has in its inner part in correspondence to the first 27 and the second 28 collar of the impeller 21, a first 36 and a second 37 protruding collar, which together with the first 27 and the second 28 collar of the impeller 21 form a labyrinth course 38 separating a first pressure chamber 39 from a second pressure chamber 40. Figure 4, in which the same particulars of the above figures are indicated using the same numbers, shows an inlet pipe 42 for wash water, flowing into the central lower part of the first pressure chamber 39 and a first outlet pipe 43 which branches off at a side of the pressure chamber 39 itself allowing the wash water to reach a first rotating collector of the dishwashing machine, not shown in the figure. A second inlet pipe 44 for the wash water flowing into the upper central part of the second pressure chamber 40 and a second outlet pipe 45 which branches off at a side of the pressure chamber 40 itself and allows the wash water to reach a second rotating collector of the dishwashing machine, not shown in the figure. Both the two inlet pipes 42 and 44 draw the water from the wash tank 1.Besides it is visible a nut 46 used to fasten the impeller 21 to the shaft 16 of the electric motor 17 The device for the alternated supply of the rotating collectors described in the present variation works as follows when the electric motor turns, it makes the impeller 21 turn too, while the sump 32 and the cover 33 stand still so that the first 27 and the second 28 collar of the impeller 91 move within the first 36 and the second 37 collar of the cover 33.The helical blades 2G are set in such a way that in a first director of rotation clockwise for example they work, consequently the wash water cc ng from the nlet pipe 4 Is pumped from the first pressure chamber 39 39 to trhe fou4.1et pipe 43 and from the latter to the first rotating collector.Of course in the meantime also the radial blades 24 of the impeller 21 are turning, but the inlet pipe 44 and the outlet pipe 45. are positioned so that by means of this first direction of rotation of the electric motor 17 the radial blades 24 would suck the water supposing that there is any from the outlet pipe 45, which is connected with the second rotating collector, for carrying it inside the second pressure chamber 40. Thus in this first direction of rotation no water is sent to the second rotating collector. The labyrinth course 38 separating the first pressure chamber 39 from the second pressure chamber 40 limits the transfers of wash water from said second pressure chamber 40 to said first pressure chamber 39. When the electric motor is caused to turn in a direction opposite to the former counterclockwise for example , by means of a proper timer control, the helical blades 26 do not work and no water is sent to the first rotating collector, whereas the radial blades 24 pump the water coming from the second inlet pipe 44 from the second pressure chamber 40 to the second outlet pipe 45 and from this to the second rotating collector. In this wash phase too the labyrinth course 38 limits the transfer of water from the first pressure chamber 39 to the second pressure chamber 40 and therefore there is no mutual interference in the supply of the two rotating collectors. In another variation the upper section 23 of the impeller 21 may have a number of helical blades set in a direction opposite as to those ones of its lower section 25. In a further variation a number of holes may be done in the first outlet pipe 43 of the first pressure chamber 39 and in the second outlet pipe 45 of the second pressure chamber 40, in such a way that from such holes a certain amount of air may come in such section of the impeller 21, sinking the lispri rring easier, when the relative section of the impeller 21 placed inside said second pressure chamber 40 turns in the direction in which it has rot to work. From the description made, the advantages of the dishwashing machine with alternated supply of the rotating collectors being subject of the present invention result clear. In particular they are represented by the fact that said alternated supply is obtained without adding any device external to the water inlet pipes by means of a simple reverse of the motion of the electric motor, by the fact of having an en bloc double impeller which takes the place of two distinct impellers, by the fact of having a labyrinth course between the two pressure chambers limiting the wash water transfers and by the fact of having quite small dimensions, lower production and mounting costs in respect of the known technique. Obviously numerous other variations are possible, for the man skilled in the art, to the dishwashing machine with alternated supply of the rotating collectors being subject of the present invention without, however, departing from the scope of the present invention.
