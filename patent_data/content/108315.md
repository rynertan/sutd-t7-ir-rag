# CONTROL SYSTEM FOR HYDRAULIC AUTOMATIC CLUTCH

## Abstract
A control system comprises a starting valve wherein an engine revolution speed indicative fluid pressure and a start adjustment fluid pressure act on a spool of the valve against each other. The starting valve generates a start pressure to be used as a clutch engagement pressure for a hydraulic clutch. The start adjustment fluid pressure is generated by a start adjustment valve compled with an electronic control unit. Under the control of the electronic control unit, the start adjustment offsets a variation in the engine revolution fluid pressure when the engine idles with the vehicle at a standstill.
