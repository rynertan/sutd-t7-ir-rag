Detailed Description of the InventionSynthesis The compounds of Formula 1 can be prepared by one or more of the methods described below in Equations 1 to 6. Where specific reaction conditions are stated, these are currently preferred but may in general be varied in a manner obvious to those skilled in the art. As shown in Equation 1 below, compounds of Formula 1 , wherein R9 is not H can be prepared by reacting an appropriately substituted sulfonyl isocyalate of Formula 2 with an appropriate 2 aminopyrimidine, 2 alkylaminopyrimidine, 2amino 1,3,5 triazine or 2 alkylamino 1,3,5 triazine ofFormula 3 , R1, R2, R3, X, Y and Z being as previously defined.Equation 1EMI8.1 The reaction is best carried out in inert aprotic organic solvents such as methylene chloride, tetrahydrofuran or acetonitrile, at ambient pressure and temperature. The mode of addition is not critical however, it is often convenient to add the sulfonyl isocyanate to a stirred suspension of amine 3 . Since such isocyanates are usually liquids, their addition can be easily controlled. The reaction is generally exothermic. In some cases, the desired product is insoluble in the warm reaction medium and crystallizes from it in pure form. Products soluble in the reaction medium are isolated by evaporation of the solvent, trituration of the solid residue with solvents such as l chlorobutane or ethyl ether, and filtration. The compounds of Formula I may be purified by recrystallization or chromatography. Some of the compounds of Formula 1 may best be prepared by the method shown below in Equation 2.Equation 2EMI9.1 EMI10.1 wherein Y is CH3 or CH2CH3 and R1, R2 and Z are as previously defined, and Rg is not H. The reactions of Equation 2 are carried out according to similar procedures taught in ourEP A 30,140. Thus, in reaction 2a, a sulfonamide ofFormula 4 is reacted with a dichloropyrimidinyl isocyanate or dichlorotriazinyl isocyanate of Formula 5 in an inert solvent such as acetonitrile at reflux for 0.5 to 3 hours to form a sulfonylurea of Formula 6 .The product is isolated by filtration. In reaction 2b, 6 is reacted with two mole equivalents of sodium methoxide or sodium ethoxide in tetrahydrofuran at 0 to 250C for about one hour, followed by acidification with hydrochloric acid to a pH of about 1, to form a sulfonylurea of Formula la . The product is isolated by filtration. In reaction 2c, la is reacted with two mole equivalents of sodium methoxide in methanol at 250 to about 500C for about 1 hour, followed by acidification with hydrochloric acid to a pH of about 1, to form a sulfonylurea of Formula lb .Alternatively, as shown in reaction 2d, 6 can be reacted with at least three mole equivalents of sodium methoxide at 200 to 500C for about 1 hour, followed by acidification with hydrochloric acid to a pH of about 1, to provide lc directly, where Y of lb is OCH3.The products of reactions 2c and 2d are isolated by addition of water and filtration. The heterocyclic isocyanates of Formula 5 inEquation 2 above can be prepared by methods described in Swiss 579,062, U.S. 3,919,228, U.S. 3,732,223 andAngew Chem. Int. Ed., 10, 402 1976 , to which the reader is referred for further information. Some of the compounds of Formula 1 where R9 is not H can be prepared as shown in Equation 3 below. Reaction of a sulfonamide of Formula 4 with an appropriate methyl pyrimidinyl carbamate or methyl triazinyl carbamate of Formula 7 in the presence of an equimolar amount of trimethylaluminum, leads to compounds of Formula 1 wherein R1, R2, R3, X,Y and Z are as previously defined.Equation 3EMI11.1 The reaction of Equation 3 is best run in methylene chloride at about 25 to 400C for 10 to 96 hours under a ni trogen atmosphere. The product can be isolated by addition of an aqueous acetic acid solution followed by extraction of the product into methylene chloride, or by filtration of a product of low solubility. The product can be purified by tri turation with solvents such as l chlorobutane, ethyl acetate or ethyl ether or by column chromatography on silica gel. Many of the compounds of Formula 1 where R9 is not H can be prepared by the procedure described by Equation 4 below. Deprotonation of a sulfonamide of Formula 4 and subsequent reaction with an equi molar amount of diphenylcarbonate provides a phenyl carbamate of Formula 10 , after neutralization of the reaction mixture. Reaction of a mixture of the phenylcarbamate of Formula 10 with an appropriate 2 aminopyrimidine or 2 amino 1,3,5 triazine of Formula 3 produces the desired compounds of Formula 1 Equation 4EMI12.1 The deprotonation in Equation 4a and displacement in Equation 4b are run under an inert atmosphere in the absence of water. Bases such as n butyl lithium or lithium diisopropylamide and solvents such as tetra hydrofuran or 1,4 dioxane may be substituted for sodium hydride and dimethylformamide in reaction 4a in certain cases.Since the deprotonation described byEquation 4a is generally exothermic, external cooling and or gradual contacting of the reactants is generally preferred to prevent decomposition. The displacement described by reaction 4b is best conducted in a dipolar aprotic solvent such as dimethylformamide or hexamethylphosphoric triamide at a temperature of from 250 to 400 for one half to twenty four hours.The phenylcarbamate of Formula 10 can be isolated by the addition of an aqueous acid and extraction with a solvent such as ethyl acetate. The desired compounds of Formula 1 are prepared by contacting the phenylcarbamate of Formula 10 with an equimolar amount of an appropriate heterocyclic amine of Formula 3 in an inert solvent such as 1,4 dioxane or tetrahydrofuran at a temperature of from 200 to the reflux temperature of the solvent for from one half to twenty four hours. The product can be isolated by evaporation of the reaction solvent and can be purified by trituration with a solvent such as l chlorobutane or ethyl ether or by column chromatography. Many of the compounds of Formula 1 can be prepared by the process shown in Equation 5 below, wherein R1, R2 and R3 are as previously defined and Q is a leaving group such as chloro, bromo, iodo or an alkyl sulfonate ester.Equation 5EMI13.1 The reaction can be carried out with dipolar aprotic solvents such as dimethylformamide or solvents such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone or tetrahydrofuran. Bases which may be employed include potassium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate or triethylamine.The reaction can be conducted at temperatures ranging from 200 to the reflux temperature of the solvent.The reaction is continued, usually for a period of from one half hour to several days, until the reaction is judged to be complete by, analytical methods such as chromatography. The product is isolated by neutralization of the reaction mixture with dilute aqueous acid and extraction with a solvent such as ethyl ace tate. The crude product can be purified by tritura tion with solvents such as l chlorobutane or ethyl ether or by column chromatography. The 2 hydroxyben zenesulfonylureas of Formula 11 are themselves pre pared from the qorresponding 2 benzyloxybenzenesulfon ylureas by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid according to the teaching of J.P. Marsh and L. Goodman,. J. Org. Chem., 30, 2491 1965 . Compounds of Formula 1 wherein Rg is not H can also be prepared from compounds of Formula 1 where Rg is H by treatment with an appropriate acyl halide, sulfonyl halide or carbamoyl halide in the presence of an acid acceptor or, in the case whereinR9 is methylamino carbonyl, ethylamino carbonyl or phenylamino carbonyl, by treatment with the appropri ate isocyanate. The reaction is best conducted in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran in the presence of a base such as triethylamine at a temperature of from Do to 400 for from one hour to several hours. The reaction of acid halides may be accelerated by the addition of a small amount of a catalyst such as 4 dimethylaminopyridine. Compounds of Formula 1 wherein Rg is H can be prepared from compounds of Formula 1 wherein R9 is an alkyl or aryl sulfonyl group by contacting the sulfonate ester with dilute aqueous base. In some cases compounds of Formula 1 wherein Rg is H can be isolated directly from the reaction described byEquation 1 wherein Rg is SO2CH3. Some of the compounds of Formula 1 wherein Rg is H can be prepared by one or both of the processes described by Equation 5 or Equation 6, wherein R1 R2, R3 R10, R11, R12, X, Y and Z are as previously defined and Q is a leaving group such as chloro, bromo, iodo or a sulfonate ester.Equation 6EMI15.1 The reaction described by Equation 6 is best conducted by mixing the sulfonylurea of Formula 11 with an equimolar amount or an excess of a carbonate ester of Formula 12 in the presence of a catalyst such as imidazole. The reactants are mixed vigorously and heated to a temperature sufficient to cause the liberation of carbon dioxide, with 1300 to 1600 being preferred. Compounds of Formula 1 are isolated by trituration with a solvent such as diethyl ether, by recrystallization or by chromatography. Many of the intermediate sulfonyl isocyanates of Formula 2 in Equation 1 above can be prepared from sulfonamides 4 by methods described in U.S.4,238,621. The method requires reacting sulfonamides with phosgene, in the presence of n butyl isocyanate and a tertiary amine catalyst, at reflux in a solvent such as xylene. A preferred catalyst is 1,4 diazabicyclo 2.2.2 octane DABCO . Alternatively, many of the sulfonyl isocyanates 2 can be prepared from sulfonamides 4 by a twostep procedure. This consists of first reacting the sulfonamide with n butyl isocyanate and a base such as potassium carbonate at. reflux in an inert solvent such as 2 butanone to form a n butyl sulfonylurea and secondly reacting this product with phosgene and DABCO catalyst at reflux in xylene solvent. This method is similar to a procedure taught by Ulrich and Sayigh,Newer Methods of Preparative Organic Chemis try, Vol.VI, p. 223 241, Academic Press, New York and London,W. Foerst Ed. Alternatively, many of the sulfonyl isocyanates 2 can be prepared from sulfonamides 4 by the method of Ulrich, et al., J. Org. Chem., 34, 3200 1969 as shown in Equation 7 below.Equation 7EMI16.1 pyridine cat solvent The sulfonamide 4 is boiled under reflux with an excess of thionyl chloride which functions as a reactant and a solvent. The reaction is continued until the sulfonamide protons are undetectable in the proton resonance spectrum. An overnight reaction period about 16 hours is generally sufficient. The thionyl chloride is removed under vacuum and the residue dissolved in an inert solvent, such as toluene, benzene, xylenes, etc., treated with a catalytic amount of. pyridine and then at least one equivalent of phosgene. The mixture is heated to between 600 and 1400C, with 800 to 1000C preferred. Conversion to the sulfonyl isocyanate is substantially complete within about 1 1 2 to 3 hours.The mixture containing the sulfonyl isocyanate can be used directly for the next reaction step formation of compounds of Formula 1 or the sulfonyl isocyanate can be isolated in purified form by filtration and evaporation of the filtrate, optionally followed by vacuum distillation. Equation 8 shown below illustrates the preparation of the required methyl pyrimidinyl carbamates and methyl triazinyl carbamates of Formula 7 in Equation 3 above, wherein R3, X, Y and Z are as previously defined. Equation 8EMI17.1 According to Equation 8, a heterocyclic amine ofFormula 3 is reacted with two equivalents of sodium hydride and excess dimethylcarbonate to form 7 . The reaction is run in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at 250C to reflux for 1 to 24 hours. The product is isolated by a adding about two equivalents of concentrated HC1 and water saturated withNaCl, and b separating out the organic phase and concentrating to dryness in vacuo. The synthesis of heterocylic amines such as 3 above has been reviewed in The Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds , a series published by IntersciencePubl., New York and London. 2 Aminopyrimidines are described by D. J. Brown in The Pyrimidines , Vol.XVI of this series. 2 Amino 1,3,5 triazines can be prepared according to methods described by E. M. Smolin and L. Rapaport in .s Triazines and Derivatives ,Vol. XIII of the same series. The synthesis of triazines is also described by F. C. Schaefer, U.S.3,154,547 and by K. R. Huffman and F. C. Schaefer J. Org. Chem., 28, 1816 1963 . The preparation of sulfonamides of Formula 4 may be accomplished by one or more of the methods described below in Equations 9 and 10. Choice of the appropriate method of preparation may be influenced by the substituents R1 and 82 and would be obvious to one skilled in the art. As shown in Equation 9 below, intermediate sul fohamides of Formula 4 may be prepared by amination of the corresponding sulfonyl chlorides 13 whereinR1 and R2 are as previously defined.Equation 9EMI18.1 Conversion of sulfonyl chlorides to sulfonamides is well known e.g., L. F. Fieser and M. Fieser, Advanced Organic Chemistry, p. 699, Reinhold, New York, 1961 . The amination described in Equation 9 is conveniently carried out by treating a solution of the sulfonyl chloride 13 with at least two mole equivalents of anhydrous ammonia in a solvent such as ethyl ether or methylene chloride at 200 to 300C. If the sulfonamide product 4 is insoluble, it may be isolated by filtration followed by washing the salts out with water. If product 4 is soluble in the reaction solution, it may be isolated by filtering off the pre cipitated ammonium chloride and evaporation of the solvent.Alternatively,. many sulfonamides 4 can be prepared by reaction of corresponding sulfonyl chlorides 13 with excess aqueous ammonium hydroxide in tetrahydrofuran at 0 to about 400C for 0.5 to 10 hours. The sulfonamide product 4 is isolated by evaporation of the tetrahydrofuran solvent, addition of water to the residue and filtration. w Alternatively, sulfonamides of Formula 4 may be prepared by alkylation of the corresponding 2 hydroxybenzenesulfonamide 14 as shown below in Equation 10 wherein R2 and Q are as previously defined and when R1 is a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl residue, or when R1 is an aryl residue and R8 is nitro, trifluoromethyl or methylsulfonyl, and 9 is fluoro or chloro.Equation 10EMI19.1 The alkylation described by Equation 10 can be carried out in a solvent such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone or dimethylformamide in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate. When R1 is an aryl residue, the reaction may be facilitated by the addition of copper salts. The 2 hydroxybenzenesulfonamides 14 can be prepared using one or more of the methods described below in Equations 11, 12, 13 and 14.Equation 11EMI19.2 Equation 12EMI20.1 Equation 13EMI20.2 Equation 14EMI20.3 The methyl aryl ethers of Formula 15 can be cleaved by methods well known in the art. Cleavage with Lewis acids, such as boron tribromide, is shown in Equation 11 and such reactions are described inJ. Am. Chem. Soc., 64, 1128 1942 . Equation 12 illustrates cleavage by sulfur nucleophiles and such reactions are described in Tetrahedron Letters 1327 1970 . Hydrogenolysis of the benzyloxybenzenesulfonamides of Formula 16 may also be employed for the preparation of the 2 hydroxybenzenesulfonamides 14 .Reactions of this type are described in J. Chem. Soc., 2903 1958 . Methanesulfonate esters of Formula 17 are cleaved using aqueous base or mineral acids. The cleavage of methanesulfonate esters and the preparation of 2 sulfamylphenyl methanesulfonates 17 is described in Research Disclosure, pg. 52 1978 . The preparation of sulfonamides of Formula 4 wherein R9 is H can be accomplished by one or more of the methods described below in Equations 15 to 18, wherein R1, R2, R10, R11, R12 R13, R14 R15 and Q are as previously defined.Equation 15EMI21.1 The reaction described by Equation 15 can be conducted in solvents such as dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, acetone or 2 butanone at a temperature of from 250 to the reflux temperature of the solvent for a period of from a few hours to several days. Bases which can be employed include potassium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate and sodium hydride.Equation 16EMI21.2 The reaction described by Equation 16 can be conducted in a solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide or in the absence of a solvent. Bases which may be employed include potassium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate and sodium hydride.Equation 17EMI21.3 Equation 18EMI22.1 The reaction described by Equation 17 and Equation 18 are conducted by he ating a mixture of one part of the 2 hydroxybenzenesulfonamide of Formula 14 , one molar equivalent to several equivalents of an appropriately substituted carbonate ester of Formula 12 or Formula 19 and from one one hundreth part to one tenth part of a catalyst such as imidazole. The combined reactants are mixed vigorously in the absence of a solvent and are heated to a temperature at least sufficient to liquefy the mixture and to cause the liberation of carbon dioxide, with a temperature of from 1300 to 1600 being preferred. Heating is continued until the evolution of carbon dioxide has ceased and the reaction is deemed to be complete by analytical methods such as chromatography. The sulfonamides of Formula 4 are isolated by trituration with a solvent such as diethyl ether and can be purified by recrystallization or by chromatography. Reactions wherein the carbonate esters of Formula 12 orFormula 19 are asymmetrically substituted may result in the formation regioisomeric product mixtures which may require further separation by methods such as chromatography. The carbonate esters of Formula 12 and Formula 19 are themselves prepared from the corresponding diols and phosgene by methods well known in the art. The sulfonamides of Formula 4 wherein R9 is not H can be prepared from the appropriate sulfonamide of Formula 4 wherein Rg is H by treatment of the alcohol with the appropriate acyl halide, sulfonyl halide, carbamoyl halide or isocyanate. The reaction is best conducted in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran in the presence of a base such as triethylamine at a temperature of from 0 to 400 for from one hour to several hours. The reaction of acid halides may be accelerated by the addition of a catalyst such as 4 dimethylaminopyridine. Many intermediate sulfonyl chlorides of Formula 13 can be prepared from amines of Formula 20 by di azotization of the amine in dilute sulfuric acid and coupling the diazonium salt with sulfur dioxide in the presence of copper salts, as shown below in Equation 19 wherein R1 and R2 .are as previously defined.Equation 19EMI23.1 The reaction of Equation 19 is accomplished by treating a solution of the amine 20 in dilute sulfuric acid with a solution of sodium nitrite in water at 0 to 50C. After stirring for 10 to 30 minutes at about OOC to insure complete diazotization, the solution added to a mixture of an excess of sulfur dioxide and cupric chloride dihydrate in glacial acetic acid and hydrochloric acid at about 100 to 350C. The mixture is stirred at 100 to 350C for 2 to 24 hours.A cosolvent such as ether or n butyl chloride may be added. The solution is poured into a large excess of ice water. The sulfonyl chloride 13 can be isolated by filtration or by extraction into a solvent such as ethyl ether, methylene chloride or, preferably, 1chlorobutane followed by drying and evaporation of the solvent. Aromatic amines such as those of Formula 20 may either be purchased or prepared by the reduction of the corresponding aromatic nitro compounds of Formula 21 , according to Equation 20, shown below wherein R1 and R2 are as previously described. Reduction of aromatic nitro compounds to anilines is well known in the art e.g., H. O. House, Modern Synthetic Reactions , Second Edition, Chapters 1 4, W. A. Benjamin, Inc., U.S.A., 1972 .Equation 20EMI24.1 In those cases in which R1 is a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl residue the aromatic nitro compounds of Formula 21 can be prepared by the reaction described in Equation 21, wherein R1 is an appropriate alkyl residue and Q is a leaving group such as chloro, bromo, iodo or alkyl sulfonate ester.Equation 21EMI24.2 Aromatic nitro compounds of Formula 21 whereinR1 is an aryl residue can be prepared by the procedure given in Equation 22 below, wherein R2, R7 and R8 are as previously defined and Q is a suitable leaving group such as fluoro, chloro, bromo or iodo.Equation 22EMI25.1 The reaction shown in Equation 22 may be facilitated by the addition of copper salts. Compounds of Formula 24 or Formula 25 wherein R2 and R8 are not methyl may also be prepared by the procedure given in Equation 23 below.Equation 23EMI25.2 The methyl group of compounds of Formula 22 may be oxidized with reagents such as potassium permanganate or potassium dichromate. The resulting carboxylic acids of Formula 23 may then be transformed into the corresponding methyl ester with a variety of reagents such as methanol and an acid catalyst or diazomethane to provide compounds ofFormula 24 as shown in reaction 23b . Compounds ofFormula 25 can be prepared from compounds of Formula 23 as shown in reaction 23c by treatment with a fluorinating agent such as sulfur tetrafluoride in the presence of hydrogen fluoride. The compounds of Formula 22 can themselves be prepared by the reaction described by Equation 22. Intermediate sulfonyl chlorides of Formula 13 in which R1 is an alkyl or dimethylaminoalkyl group and R2 is not a chloro or bromo substituent may also be prepared by one of the methods described by Equations 23 and 24, below.Equation 23EMI26.1 Equation 24EMI27.1 Bromoaryl ethers of Formula 26 are dissolved in a solvent or a solvent mixture such as ether or ether and hexane and are cooled to a temperature of between 780 and OOC under a dry, inert atmosphere.Addition of a solution of n butyl lithium in hexane effects metal halogen exchange to provide the organolithium intermediate 27 . In some cases, metallation is facilitated by warming the reaction mixture to room temperature for periods of up to one half hour. As described in Equation 23, the organolithium intermediate 27 is treated at a temperature of from 50 to 200C with sulfur dioxide to form the sulfinate salt 28 . The salt 28 is then converted into the desired sulfonyl chloride 13 by treatment with a chlorinating agent such as chlorine or N chlorosuccinimide in solvent mixtures such as aqueous acetic acid or acetone and acetic acid at temperatures of from 200 to lO0C. Alternatively, the sulfinate salt 28 may be suspended in an inert solvent such as methylene chloride at a temperature of from 780 to 500C and treated with sulfuryl chloride. The sulfonyl chlorides 13 are isolated by aqueous work up and extraction with an organic solvent.The preparation of sulfonyl chlorides by sequential treatment of organo lithium species with sulfur dioxide and a chlorinating agent is taught in U.S. 4,127,405. The sulfonyl chlorides 13 may also be prepared from the organolithium intermediate 27 by addition of the organolithium 27 to sulfuryl chloride as described by Equation 24. The reaction is carried out at from 300 to 200C in a mixture of ether and hexane, preferably one part ether to one part hexane.The sulfonyl chlorides 13 are isolated by aqueous work up and extraction with an organic solvent. The preparation of sulfonyl chlorides from organolithium species by treatment with sulfuryl chloride is discussed in J. Chem. Soc. C , 1265 1968 . The intermediate bromoaryl ethers 26 are prepared by alkylation of the appropriate bromophenols by methods well known in the art. Some of the sulfonyl chlorides 13 in which R1 does not contain functionality reactive with chlorine or aqueous acid can be prepared by the.method described by Equation 25.Equation 25EMI28.1 The disulfide intermediates 29 are treated with chlorine and water in a solvent such as acetic acid or a mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acids at a temperature of from 0 to 700C for from one hour to several hours. The reaction mixture is diluted with cold water and the sulfonyl chloride 13 is separated by filtration, in the case of a solid product, or by decanting off the aqueous layer, in the case of a liquid product. The disulfide intermediates 29 are prepared by alkylation of the bis phenol disulfides of Formula 30 with the appropriate alkylating agent or activated aryl fluoride in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate in a solvent such as methyl ethyl ketone or dimethylformamide, as illustrated by Equation 26 below.Equation 26EMI29.1 The bis phenol disulfides 30 are themselves prepared from the appropriate mercaptophenols by oxidation with reagents such as oxygen in a basic medium or iodine in a solvent such as benzene or toluene. Certain sulfonyl chlorides of Formula 13 in which R1 is a substituent stable to acidic conditions, especially those in which R2 is a 5 F, 5 C1, 5 Br, 5 CH3 or 5 CF3 substituent, may be prepared by chlorosulfonation on the appropriately substituted aryl alkyl ether of Formula 31 as. illustrated byEquation 27, below.Equation 27EMI29.2 It is to be understood that an appropriate substitution pattern in substrates of Formula 31 , consistent with the theories of electrophilic aromatic substitution see, for instance, J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry , pp. 383 390, McGraw Hill, NewYork, 1968 , is necessary to avoid the formation of undesired regioisomers. Alternatively, undesired regioisomers may be separated by physical purification methods, such as recrystallization, distillation or chromatography. Chlorosulfonation of aromatic substrates is well known e.g., L. F. Fieser and M. Fieser, Advanced Organic Chemistry, 696 698, Reinhold, New York, 1961 .Chlorosulfonation can be accomplished by addition of the aryl alkyl ether to chloroslfonic acid or vice versa, optionally in the presence of a cosolvent, such as an alkane or chlorinated alkane e.g., hexane, 1chlorobutane, methylene chloride, etc. . The reaction temperature is not critical, with a range of about 5 to 500 being usuable and ambient temperature e.g., 200 to 300C being preferred for convenience. Reaction time at ambient temperature is about 1 to 24 hours, depending on the exact substrate being chlorosulfonated, with an overnight period about 16 hours generally being sufficient. The aromatic sulfonyl chloride is conveniently isolated from the reaction mixture by pouring the mixture into ice water, followed by extracting it with a water immiscible organic solvent in which the aromatic sulfonyl chloride is soluble. Such solvents include l chlorobutane, methylene chloride, 1,2 dichloroethane, ethyl acetate, toluene, and diethyl ether. Agriculturally suitable salts of compounds ofFormula 1 are also useful herbicides and can be prepared in a number of ways known to the art. For example, metal salts can be made by contacting compounds of Formula 1 with a solution of an alkali or alkaline earth metal salt having a sufficiently basic anion e.g., alkoxide, carbonate or hydroxide . Quaternary amine salts can be made by similar techniques. Salts of compounds of Formula 1 can also be prepared by exchange of one cation for another. Cationic exchange can be effected by direct contact of an aqueous solution of a salt of a compound of Formula 1 e.g., alkali metal or quaternary amine salt with a solution containing the cation to be exchanged.This method is most effective when the desired salt containing the exchanged cation is insoluble in water, e.g., a copper salt, and,cdn be separated by filtra tion. Exchange may also be effected by passing an aqueous solution of a salt of a compound of Formula 1 e.g., an alkali metal or quaternary amine salt through a column packed with a cation exchange resin containing the cation to be exchanged. In this me thod, the cation of the resin is exchanged for that of the original salt and the desired product is eluted from the column. This method is particularly useful when the desired salt is water soluble, e.g., a potas sium, sodium or calcium salt. Acid addition salts, useful in this invention, can be obtained by reacting a compound of Formula 1 with a suitable acid, e.g., p toluenesulfonic acid, trichloroacetic acid or the like.

Example 12 N 4 Methoxy 6 methylpyrimidin 2 yl aminocarbonyl 2 2 methylsulfonyloxyethoxy benzenesulfonamide To 1.5 g 0.01 mol of 2 2 hydroxyethoxy ben zenesulfonamide methanesulfonate ester suspended in 100 ml of dry dichloromethane under a nitrogen atmosphere was added dropwise 3.0 ml 0.012 mol of a 2M solution of trimethylaluminum in toluene. Gas evolution and a mild exotherm occured during the addition of the trimethylaluminum solution and the mixture slowly became homogeneous. After stirring the solution at ambient temperature for 1.5 hours, 1.1 g 0.011 mol of methyl 4 methoxy 6 methylpyrimidin 2ylcarbamate was added in one portion. The resulting mixture was heated to reflux under a nitrogen atmosphere for 18 hours. The mixture was then cooled and 50 ml of 5 hydrochloric acid was slowly added.The organic layer was separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with two 50 ml portions of dichloromethane.The organic solutions were combined and washed with 50 ml of saturated sodium chloride solution. After drying over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, the solvents were evaporated to yield 2.2 g of the crude product which was recrystallized to yield 0.4 g of the title compound m.p. 176 1790C. The infrared spectrum exhibited a band at 1700 cm , consistent with the carbonyl group of a sulfonylurea.

Example 13 2 2 Hydroxyethoxy benzenesulfonyl isocyanate methanesulfonate ester A mixture of 15.0 g 0.051 mol of 2 2 hydroxyethoxy benzenesulfonamide methanesulfonate ester and 90 ml of xylenes was heated to reflux to dissolve the sulfonamide. Heating was interrupted while 6.9 ml 6.05 g, 0.061 mol of butyl isocyanate and about 0.1 g of 1,4 diazabicyclo 2.2.2 octane were added.The mixture was heated again to reflux. Approximately 15 ml of condensed phosgene gas was added in portions and heating was continued for about three hours. An additional 10 ml of phosgene was added and heating was stopped. The xylene solution was decanted away from an insoluble brown residue and the xylenes were evaporated under. reduced pressure. The presence of the sulfonyl isocyanate group was confirmed by an intense band in the infrared spectrum at 2210 cm 1. The crude product was used without further purification. Example 14 N 4,6 Dimethylpyrimidin 2 yl aminocarbonyl 2 2 hydroxyethoxy benzenesulfonamide To a suspension of 1.2 g 0.0097 mol of 2 amino4,6 dimethylpyrimidine and a few crystals of 1,4 diaza bicyclo2.2.2 octane in 10 ml of dichloromethane was added a solution of approximately 0.01 mol of 2 2 hydroxyethoxy benzenesulfonyl isocyanate methanesulfonate ester dissolved in 10 ml of dichloromethane. A mild exotherm was noted upon mixing and a homogeneous solution resulted. The mixture was refluxed for eight hours then stirred at ambient temperature for five days. The solution was filtered and the filtrate was evaporated under reduced pressure. Trituration of the residue with diethyl ether afforded a crude solid which was recrystallized from a mixture of l chlorobutane and acetonitrile to yield 2.0 g of the title compound m.p. 183 l900C. The infrared spectrum exhibited a broad band at 3390 cm 1 consistent with a primary alcohol and a band at 1695 cm 1 consistent with the carbonyl group of a sulfonylurea. The mass spectrum exhibited a molecular ion at m e 366 and fragmentation consistent with the assigned structure.

They include dusts, granules, pellets, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates and the like. Many of these may be applied directly.Sprayable formulations can be extended in suitable media and used at spray volumes of from a few liters to several hundred liters per hectare. High strength compositions are primarily.used as intermediates for further formulation. The formulations, broadly, contain about 0.1 to 99 by weight of active ingredient s and at least one of a about 0.1 to 20 surfactant s and b about 1 to 99.9 solid or liquid inert diluent s .More specifically, they will contain these ingredients in the following approximate proportions Table X Weight Percent Active Ingredient Diluent s Surfactant s Wettable Powders 20 90 0 74 1 10Oil Suspensions, 3 50 40 95 0 15Emulsions, Solutions, including EmulsifiableConcentrates Aqueous Suspension 10 50 40 84 1 20Dusts 1 25 70 99 0 5Granules and Pellets 0.1 95 5 99.9 0 15High Strength 90 99 0 10 0 2Compositions Active ingredient plus at least one of a Surfactant or a Diluent equals 100 weight percent. Lower or higher levels of active ingredient can, of course, be present depending on the intended use and the physical properties of the compound. Higher ratios of surfactant to active ingredient are sometimes desirable, and are achieved by incorporation into the formulation or by tank mixing. Typical solid diluents are described in Watkins, et al., Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents andCarriers , 2nd Ed., Dorland Books, Caldwell, NewJersey, but other solids, either mined or manufactured, may be used. The more absorptive diluents are preferred for wettable powders and the denser ones for dusts. Typical liquid diluents and solvents are described in Marsden, Solvents Guide, 2nd Ed., Interscience, New York, 1950.Solubility under 0.1 is preferred for suspension concentrates solution concentrates are preferably stable against phase separation at OOC. McCutcheon s Detergents and EmulsifiersAnnual , MC Publishing Corp., Ridgewood, New Jersey, as well as Sisely and Wood, Encyclopedia of SurfaceActive Agents , Chemical Publishing Co., Inc., NewYork, 1964, list surfactants and recommended uses. All formulations can contain minor amounts of additives to reduce foaming, caking, corrosion, microbiological growth, etc. The methods of making such compositions are well known. Solutions are prepared by simply mixing the ingredients. Fine solid compositions are made by blending and, usually, grinding as in a hammer or fluid energy mill. Suspensions are prepared by wet milling see, for example, Littler, U.S. Patent 3,060,084 . Granules and pellets may be made by spraying the active material upon preformed granular carriers or by agglomeration techniques. See J. E.Browning, Agglomeration , Chemical Engineerinq, December 4, 1967, pp. 147ff. and Perry s ChemicalEngineer s Handbook , 5th Ed., McGraw Hill, New York, 1973, pp. 8 57ff.

Utility The compounds of the present invention are highly active herbicides, which are specifically useful for pre emergence weed control in wheat and postemergence weed control in wheat, corn, sugar beets and rice. They are also useful as pre and or post emergence herbicides in other crops and as general, broadspectrum herbicides where complete control of all vegetation is desired, such as around fuel storage tanks, ammunition depots, industrial storage areas, drive in theaters, around billboards, highway, and railroad structures. The rates of application for the compounds of the invention are determined by a number of factors depending upon the particular end result desired.These factors include use as selective or general herbicides, crop species involved, types of weeds to be controlled, weather and climate, formulations selected, mode of application, amount of foliage present, etc. In general terms, the subject compounds should be applied at levels of around 0.001 to 5 kg ha with a preferred range of 0.004 to 1 kg ha. The lower rates are suggested for use as selective post emergence herbicides in wheat, rice, sugar beets, corn and other crops. Intermediate rates are suggested for use as pre emergence herbicides on lighter soils and or those having a low organic matter content. The highest rates are suggested for pre emergence weed control on heavy soils and for general, broad spectrum weed control where control of all vegetation is desired. The.compounds of this invention may be used in combination with other commercial herbicides. They are particularly useful in combination with the following herbicides Common Name Chemical Name acifluorfen 5 2 chloro4 trifluoromethyl phenoxy 2 nitrobenzoic acid acrolein acrolein alachlor 2
