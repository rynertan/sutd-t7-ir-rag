## Description
Method and apparatus for loosening and apportioning silage. The invention relates to a method for loosening and apportioning silage, starting from a silage block, which is composed of layers with the same main direction and to an apparatus for the application of this method. In cattle farming the forage, such as pre dried grass, maize, or the like, is nowadays generally piled up at harvest time in pit silos. For this purpose a shallow trench is first formed in the soil, whereafter the harvested grass, or the maize, is spread out uniformly layer by layer horizontally along the bottom of the trench, with the forage being pressed down well whenever a layer of sufficient thickness has formed, with the aid of a heavy vehicle, for instance an agricultural tractor, which is driven over the spread out forage. When the heap of forage in the pit silo has reached the required height, a foil of plastic is spread over the forage, whereafter a layer of for instance sand or soil is deposited thereon. In this way the forage in the pit silo is sealed off air tight and is pressed down by the layer of sand or soil lying on the sealing foil. The forage is kept in the pit silo until the ensilaged stock of forage has to be used for feeding the cattle. The silage is nowadays generally removed from the pit silo in the form of blocks with the aid of a silage cutter, which is suspended on the lifting device of an agricultural tractor. The silage cutter generally comprises a carrying device for the silage block in the form of a number of horizontal carrying tines parallel to each other, which are inserted into the silage at the lower side by driving the agricultural tractor backwards. A block of silage is then cut out by a cutting device of the silage cutter moving ver tic ally and is subsequently lifted by the carrying tines of the silage cutter and transferred to the byre. In this byre the tractor with the silage cutter coupled to its rear side is driven along the cattle stalls and the silage is loosened from the silage block manually, f or instance with a pitchfork and deposited on the so called fodder passageway in a uniform layer. However, this loosening and apportioned spreading of the silage on the fodder passageway is a very arduous and fairly unpleasant job, which also requires a great deal of time. It is a first object of the present invention to provide a method for loosening and apportioning silage, starting from a silage block, which is composed of layers with the same main direction, which can be done without manual labour. For this purpose the method according to the invention is characteriz ed in that the silage block is placed in such a position, that the end face of the front layer is directed at least substantially towards a loosening and apportioning mechanism, which is coupled to a drive and which is equipped with loosening and apportioning means, whereafter the silage block is moved forwardly towards the loosening and apportioning mechanism and the loosening and apportioning means loosen the silage from the successive layers and carry out the apportioning of the loosened silage. The invention is based on the insight, that it is possible for silage to be loosened and apportioned in a simple way by mechanical loosening and apportioning means, if the silage block is supplied to these loosening and apportioning means in the position described hereinabove. In donning so suitable use is thus made of the layer construction of the silage block. Preferably the silage block is placed in such a position, that its end face, which is directed towards the loosening and apportioning mechanism, has a larger dimension in the transverse direction, which is perpendicular to the direction of movement towards the loosening and apportioning mechanism, than in the upward direction. This largest dimension of the end face of a silage block is for instance 1,8 m, while the dimension of the height of this end face is for instance 0,8 m. In order to be able to distribute the silage in a simple way, the silage block is preferably placed on a floor of a transport truck, which also supports the loosening and apportioning mechanism. The invention further relates to an apparatus for loosening and apportioning silage, starting from a silage block, which is composed of layers with the same main direction, with the application of the method described hereinbe fore This apparatus is characterized by a supporting surface, on which the silage block may be placed in such a position, that the end face of the front layer is directed at least substantially towards a loosening and apportioning mechanism, which is coupled to a drive and which is provided with loosening and apportioning means. The invention will hereafter be elucidated with reference to the drawing, which shows several embodiments by way of example of an apparatus according to the invention for loosening and apportioning silage, starting from a silage block, which is composed of layers with the same main direction. Fig. 1 is a section of a first embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention, to which a silage block is supplied by a silage cutter. Fig. 2 is a section corresponding with fig. 1, wherein the silage is loosened from the tilted silage block and is discharged. Fig. 3 is a perspective view of another embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention in the receiving position, in which a silage block is taken up from the ground. Fig. 4 is a perspective view of the apparatus ac cording to fig. 3 in the loosening and apportioning position. Figs. 5 and 6 are details of the apparatus accord ding to figs 3 and 4 on a larger scale. Fig. 7 is a partial perspective view of yet another embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention. Figs. I and 2 show a first embodiment by way of example of an apparatus according to the invention for loosening and apportioning silage, starting from a silage block, which is composed of layers with the same main direction. This apparatus comprises a rectangular, approximately horizontal frame 1 t which is for instance assembled of tubular sections and is provided at the front with a tow bar to be coupled to the towing hook of a tractor and which has two wheels 2 at the rear, so as to be mobile behind this tractor as a transport truck 7. An approximately horizontal floor 3 is mounted on the frame 1 and serves as a supporting surface, on which a silage block 4 may be placed in such a position, that the layers extend approximately vertically and are approximately parallel to a plane through the transversely extending horizontal shafts of a pair of cooperating, rotatable, loosening and apportioning drums 5, 6, which together form a loosening and apportioning mechanism, the shafts lying approximately vertically one above the other The silage block 4 which is placed, in a manner still to be further described hereinafter, in the correct position on the floor 3 of the transport truck 7 may be moved forward along the floor 3 towards the drums 5, 6 by means of a carrier member in the form of a carrier carriage 9 coupled to a drive means 8. In the embodiment according to figs. 1 and 2 the carrier carriage 9 is at the same time constructed as a tilting means for the silage block 4. To this end the carrier carriage 9 comprises a tilting device 10, which may be pivoted through approximately 900 about a shaft 15, which is parallel to the shafts of the drums 5, 6. Spaced pins 11 are fixed on the tilting device 10. The tilting device 10 further comprises a plurality of spaced tines or support rods 12, which are arranged side by side and which are supported by a stop 13 in their approximately horizontal position and abut against the carrier carriage 9 in their vertical position. After a silage block 4 has been supplied on the carrying tines 14 of a silage cutter to the position shown in fig. 1, wherein the main direction of the layers from which the silage block is composed, is approximately horizontal, just as it was in the pit silo, these carrying tines 14 are displaced downwardly, so that the silage block 4 comes to rest on the support rods 12 and the pins 11 are inserted in the silage block 4. Care should be taken that the centre of gravity of the silage block 4 in fig. 1 lies to the left of the pivot shaft 15 of the tilting device 10. When the carrying tines 14 of the silage cutter are then withdrawn, the silage block 4 will pivot in the way shown by the dot and dash lines, together with the tilting device 10 with the pins 11 and the support rods 12, so that the silage block comes to rest on the floor 3 of the transport truck 7 in the position, wherein the layers from which the silage block is composed, are approximately vertical and are directed towards the loosening and apportioning mechanism formed by the drums 5, 6. After the silage block 4 has been tilted, the tilted support rods 12, together with the wall of the carrier carriage 9 may act as carriers for the silage block 4. A spring not shown can then act on the tilting device 10 and holds the tilting device 10, if the same is unloaded, in the position shown in fig. 1 by the drawn lines. As an alternative for the tines or support rods 12 the tilting device 10 may be equipped with a plate not shown , which acts after tilting as a carrier plate for the silage block 4. The lower part 9 of the wall of the carrier carriage 9 has a shape which is adapted to the shape of the lower drum 5. In this manner it is prevented, that silage would collect in a blind corner of the carrier carriage 9. The carrier carriage 9 may travel along the floor 3 by means of rollers 16. It is of course also possible as an alternative to let the carrier carriage 9 slide over the floor 3. The drive means 8 for the carrier carriage 9 con silts in the embodiment shown by way of example of a pair of endless chains 17, which extend approximately perpendicular to the plane through the shafts. of the drums 5, 6 in the direction of movement of the silage block 4 and to which the carrier carriage 9 is coupled The drive of the endless chains 17 is obtained from the drive of the lower drum 5 The endless chains 17 may move to and fro, thereby moving the carrier carriage 9 for the silage block 4 to and fro between two end positions. A ratchet wheel 18 is used to drive the endless chains 17 from the lower drum 5 and cooperates with two pawls 19 operating in opposite directions. These pawls 19 may be driven from an eccentric by an actuating rod 21, which includes a double acting spring element 22. The pawls 19 may be driven from an eccentric by an actuating rod 21, which includes a double acting spring element 22.The pawls 19 are made inoperative by this spring element 22 in both end positions of the carrier carriage 9, as in these end positions the endless chains 17 are braked by the carrier carriage 9 and the spring element 22 takes up the feed stroke of the eccentric It is also quite possible for the carrier carriage 9 not to be fixedly connected to the endless chains 17, but to be adapted to be coupled thereto and uncoupled therefrom, in which case it is possible for instance to provide for an accelerated return of the carrier carriage 9. As shown in fig. 1, the two drums 5, 6 are driven in the same direction in such a way, that the lower drum 5 rotates in the discharge direction at the location of the discharge slot present between the drums 5, 6, while the upper drum 6 throws back any excess of loosened silage at the location of the discharge slot and ensures the apportionment. The upper drum 6 is equipped with catch strips 23, made of angle sections, the two free end edges thereof extending in the longitudinal direction and being welded to this drum 6. The lower drum 5 is equipped with slidable loosening pins 24, which are projected outwardly of the drum 5 by means of an eccentric shaft 20 at a maximum at the side of the drum 5 directed towards the silage block 4 to be loosened, and at a minimum at the opposite side. In this way it is prevented, that loosened silage could be carried back again beneath the lower drum 5. These loosening pins 24, which can exercise an excellent loosening effect on grass, have their operation effectively supported where the silage consists of maize by catch strips 25, which are fastened to the lower drum 5 and which extend in the longitudinal direction of this drum 5. The loosening pins 24 are projected outwardly through these catch strips 25. The lower drum 5 has a polygonal cross section a hexagonal cross section in the embodiment shown in the drawing by way of example , the loosening pins 24 and the catch strips 25 operating at the location of the ribs of the drum 5. The catch strips 25 of the lower drum 5 consist ofU sections, which are welded to the lower drum 5 with their free edges extending in the longitudinal direction. The drive of the two drums 5, 6 takes place from the appliance shaft of the tractor, which is used for moving the transport truck 7. The transport truck 7 has an upstanding front wall and an upstanding rear wall in addition to the floor 3, while a flap 26 is applied at the discharge side, which exposes the drums 5, 6 in the position wherein it is pivoted upwardly A short roof section 27 is formed at the upper side of the transport truck 7, a closure plate 28 being hinged thereto, which prevents loosened silage from leaving the transport truck 7 from the wrong side. In the embodiment shown in the drawing by way of example the direction of travel of the transport truck 7 is approximately perpendicular to the upper part of the endless chains 17. This position is particularly suitable, if only one silage block 4 is supported at a time on the floor 3 of the transport truck 7, in the way indicated in the drawing. If, on the other hand, several silage blocks 4, for instance three silage blocks 4, are to be placed simultaneously on the floor 3 of the transport truck 7, so that the distribution of the silage may take place with less interruptions, it is proposed according to the invention, that the direction of travel of the transport truck 7 is approximately the same as the direction of the upper part of the endless chains 17.In this case a transverse conveyor not shown , preferably with a reversible direction of transport, is supported by the transport truck 7 at the discharge side of the drums 5, 6 and ensures the apportioned discharge of the loosened silage, Figs. 3 and 4 show a modified embodiment of the apparatus according too the invention, which is again in the form of a transport truck 7 and which is intended in particular to loosen and apportion silage blocks, which are temporarily stored at a suitable place, such as a buffer store at the end of a forage passageway, for instance in a quan tity, required for a specific feeding period. This apparatus comprises a rear tilting device 29, which is equipped with a plurality of tines 30 or with a loading plate, as well as with a supply conveyor 31, which is perpendicular to the tines 30. The tines 30 in their downwardly pivoted horizontal position fig. 3 , in which they extend approximately at the level of the ground, are slid beneath a silage block from the buffer store by driving the tractor backwards, By pivoting the tilting device 29 through approximately 900 into the position shown in fig. 4, by means of cylinder piston assemblies 32, the silage block is deposited on the supply conveyor 31, which in this position extends approximately horizontally and forms the floor of the transport truck 7, in such a way that the main direction of the layers extends approximately vertically and these layers extend approximately perpendicularly to the direction of travel of the supply conveyor 31. The supply conveyor 31 comprises driven transport chains with carriers 33, which displace the silage block resting on the supply conveyor 31 towards a forwardly and upwardly inclining loosening conveyor 34. At a distance above the front end portion of the loosening conveyor 34 a driven return or apportioning means 35 extends in the transverse direction. The width of this return or apportioning means 35 is approximately equal to the width of the loosening conveyor 34. In the embodiment shown in the drawing by way of example the loosening conveyor 34 is equipped with driven transport chains with carriers 36, which carry forwardly inclined, pointed, hook shaped tines 37. The return or apportioning means 35 is shown in figs. 3 and 4 as a rake means equipped with tines, but may also be made in a different way. The excess quantity of crop carried by the loosening conveyor 34 is returned by this return or apportioning means 35. The loosening conveyor 34 and the return or apportioning means 35 therefore together determine the quantity of crop, passing per unit of time. This loosened and apportioned crop falls down through a hopper 38 on a front transverse conveyor 39, which has a reversible direction of drive and which serves for delivering the crop. During this delivery the transport truck 7 is moved along the forage passageway with the aid of the tractor, so that a regularly distributed and apportioned quantity of crop is deposited on this forage passageway. The thickness of the layer deposited on the forage passageway depends on the quantity delivered over the distance covered in a set unit of time. When the level of the crop to be loosened becomes too high on the loosening conveyor 34, a sensing member 41 mounted on one side wall 40 or on both side walls 40 is actuated. The front side wall 40 is mainly deleted in figs.3 and 4. Fig. 6 shows an embodiment by way of example of such sensing member 41. A sensing plate 42 projects outwardly through a slot in the relative side wall 40 and is journalled with a bent end on the outer surface of the relative side wall 40. An actuating rod system 43 is connected to this end of the sensing plate 42 located outside the side wall 40, and can switch the drive means of the supply conveyor 31 on and off. If the level of the crop on the loosening conveyor 34 becomes too high, the crop comes into contact with the sensing plate 42 and this sensing plate 42 is pivoted away towards the relative side wall 40 fig. 6 , so that the crop may pass, while the drive means of the supply conveyor 31 is temporarily switched off. As soon as the level of the crop on the loosening conveyor 34 has dropped sufficiently, the sensing plate 42, or the sensing plates 42, is are returned in the initial position by means of a spring or other return device which is not shown, so that the drive means of the supply conveyor 31 is switched on again. The sensing plate s 42 must be positioned at alevel, which lies above the upper surface of a silage block supplied on the supply conveyor 31 and of course underneath the area of operation of the return or apportioning means 35. For finely chaffed crop, such as for instance maize, a stripper plate 44 fig. 5 is applied, which comes into contact with the carriers 33 of the supply conveyor 31 at the beginning of the bottom part. This stripper plate 44 is supported by springs 45 and a bevelled surface thereof comes into contact with the front edge of the carriers 33, so that the stripper plate 44 is pressed downwardly and scrapes along the underside of the passing carriers 33. The stripped material falls into a receptacle 46 from which it is discharged by the carriers 36 of the loosening conveyor 34. The apparatus, which forms the transport truck 7, is coupled to the lifting device of the tractor and is supported at the rear by one or more swivelling wheels 47. Fig. 7 shows yet a further modified embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention, in which the tilting device 48 no longer comprises the supply conveyor 49, but consists only of tines 50 carried by a cross beam or of a loading plate. In this case a curved guide plate 51 is fitted to the front side of the cross beam carrying the tines 50. The silage block, after having been partly tilted, is supported on this guide plate 51, until the block comes to rest on the supply conveyor 49. The invention is not restricted to the embodiments shown in the drawing by way of example, which may be varied in several ways within the scope of the invention.
