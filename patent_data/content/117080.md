## Description
The invention relates to cosmetically acceptable products, particularly oil in water emulsions containing an amphiphilic compound which possesses a skin benefit property. An amphiphilic compound is one which possesses in the same molecule distinct regions of lipophilic and hydrophilic character. When incorporated in an emulsion, an amphiphilic compound will accordingly normally partition into both the aqueous and the oily phases. If such an emulsion is then applied to human skin, delivery of the amphiphilic compound selectively to the skin surface can be impaired due to the fact that a significant amount remains in the oily phase. The earlier European application EP A 86 070 published on 17 August 1983 quotes compositions containing 2 hydroxy octanoic acid together with emulsifier, mineral oil and 2 hydroxy propionic acid as well as other ingredients. It has now been discovered that a totally new type of product can be formed between water, a special normally solid emulsifier capable of forming a gel phase, and an activity enhancer, which together provides a vehicle for certain specified amphiphilic compounds with enhanced delivery properties due to partition of the amphiphilic compound almost exclusively into the aqueous phase, Accordingly, the invention provides a cosmetically acceptable product for topical application to human skin which comprises The product of the invention is accordingly one in which the aqueous phase forms from 5 to 99 , preferably from 50 to 90 by volume and the gel phase forms from 1 to 95 , preferably from 5 to 50 by volume. The gel phase comprises long straight hydrophobic alkyl chains C₁₄ to C₂₀ with an average HLB value of no more than 11, the alkyl chain groups being rigid and packed in a hexagonal lattice they undergo rapid rotation about the chain axis and are characterised by having an X ray reflection of from 0.37 to 0.44nm. It should be explained that similar systems having an X ray reflection of less than 0.37 nm are solids and those having an X ray reflection of greater than 0.44 nm form a lamellar phase which does not possess the properties and advantages of a gel phase as described herein. The formation, structure and properties of the gel phase are further described in Biological Membranes Physical Fact Function Ed. by Denis Chapman 1968 . It has been discovered that incorporation of an amphiphilic compound into a product in which such a gel phase is already preformed results in partition of a substantial proportion of the amphiphilic compound into the aqueous phase, with the result that the amphiphilic compound possesses greater affinity for human skin following topical application of the product, than would be the case if the amphiphilic compound had been incorporated into a normal oil in water emulsion. This is because the gel phase resists partition into it and co crystallisation with it of the amphiphilic compound, so that the availability of the amphiphilic compound to the skin from the aqueous phase, following topical application of the product, is thereby enhanced. The product comprises an amphiphilic compound which is characterised by its ability to partition between octanol and water and is accordingly defined as having a log partition coefficient in octanol water of from 0.5 to 2.0. The amphiphilic compound is further characterised by the proviso that when an unbranched alkyl chain is present in the molecule, then that chain contains no more than 12 carbon atoms. It should be explained that if the amphiphilic compound is one having an unbranched alkyl chain with more than 12 carbon atoms, then it can co crystallise in the gel phase, whereas it will not behave in this way if the unbranched alkyl chain contains no more than 12 carbon atoms. Examples of amphiphilic compounds which fulfil the above criteria and which are suitable for use in the products of the invention are given below together with their respective log partition coefficients. The following three compounds are outside the requirements of the invention The amphiphilic compound to be incorporated in the product of the invention should form from 0.001 to 20 , preferably from 0.01 to 10 and most preferably from 0.01 to 5 by weight of the product. The appropriate amount of amphiphilic compound employed will depend on its function and property on the skin and the purpose for which it is applied. The product according to the invention will also comprise one or more emulsifiers which are normally solid at room temperature, that is at 20 C, and which have an average HLB value of from 5 to 11 and which are capable of producing a gel phase with water. Examples of preferred emulsifiers together with their respective HLB values are given below Where a mixture of more than one emulsifier is employed, it is possible that each may have an HLB value outside the range of from 5 to 11, provided that the mixture has an average HLB value within this range. Examples of preferred mixtures of emulsifiers together with their respective average HLB values are given below The emulsifier, whether a single emulsifier or mixtures thereof, to be incorporated into the product of the invention should form from 1 to 20 , preferably from 2 to 10 by weight of the emulsion. The product according to the invention will also comprise an activity enhancer whose presence further improves the delivery to the skin of the amphiphilic compound. The activity enhancer accordingly effectively increases the partition of the amphiphilic compound into the skin from the product when applied topically. The activity enhancer will have little or no effect on improving skin benefit such as increasing skin plasticisation when used alone it is only when combined with the amphiphilic compound that a substantial increase in skin benefit is realised. While screening a series of non electrolytes for their ability to function as activity enhancers, it was observed that they were all compounds which were capable of substantially increasing the cloud point temperature of nonionic surfactants. Such compounds included short chain alkanols, diols and short chain fatty acids. By contrast, other non electrolytes which reduce the cloud point temperature of nonionic surfactants, such as long chain alcohols, for example, butan 1 ol and cyclohexanol polyols, for example sorbitol and propan 1,2,3 triol, do not function as activity enhancers. An activity enhancer is accordingly defined as a non electrolyte which is capable, at a concentration of 5 by weight of increasing the cloud point temperature of a 0.025M aqueous solution of polyoxyethylene 8 nonylphenyl ether by at least 10 C. Preferably the activity enhancer is one which is capable of increasing the cloud point temperature by at least 15 C, most preferably by at least 20 C. It should be explained that the cloud point is a measure of the inverse solubility of a nonionic surfactant with temperature and can be determined by heating a standard clear aqueous solution of the nonionic surfactant until the solution becomes visibly cloudy and then measuring the temperature. The cloud point temperature can conveniently be determined automatically using the equipment and method described by Baum et al in Mat. Res. Std. Examples of suitable compounds functioning as activity enhancers, together with the respective elevated cloud point temperature obtained in each case when using the standard test defined hereinbefore are listed below in Table 1. By way of comparison, we list below in Table 2 examples of non electrolytes which do The activity enhancer should form from, 0.1 to 50 , preferably from 0.5 to 25 by weight of the product. The product according to the invention will also comprise from 5 to 98.899 , preferably from 9 to 95 by weight of water which will form a substantial proportion of the aqueous phase in the emulsion. The product also comprises from 1 to 75 by weight, preferably from 1 to 30 by weight, of an oil, fat or wax, herein referred to as oil having a dielectric constant of not greater than 3.0. It is apparent that if an oil possessing a higher dielectric constant is employed, then the affinity of the amphiphilic compound for the oil will be unacceptably high, and the delivery to the skin of the amphiphilic compound will thereby be impaired. Examples of preferred oils , when employed, together with their dielectric constants measured when they are in a liquid state are given below Further examples of oils having a dielectric constant 3.0 include mineral oil, n tetradecane, n hexadecane, n octadecane, SIRIUS M85 Paraffin Oil ex Dalton Industries , ISOPAR L C₁₀ C₁₂ isoparaffin ex Esso , SILKOLENE 910 paraffin jelly ex Dalton Industries . The product can optionally also contain other hydrophilic or lipophilic materials as are conventionally employed in products which are particularly adapted to be applied topically to human skin. Examples of such optional materials include perfumes, colourants, preservatives, germicides, sunscreens and humectants. The product can take the form of a solid or semi solid cream or a gelled, thickened or free flowing liquid. The product will normally be packaged in a convenient dispenser such as a bottle, jar or tube having a closure. The invention further provides a process for the preparation of a cosmetically acceptable product containing oil suitable for topical application to human skin, which process comprises the steps of The product according to the invention is suitable for topical application to human skin and is intended to provide enhanced delivery to the skin of amphiphilic skin benefit compounds for cosmetic purposes, or of amphiphilic pharmaceutical or other healing agents for the treatment of skin disease. An experiment was conducted to compare the delivery to skin of phenol, as an example of an amphiphilic compound, from an ordinary emulsion and from two products having a gel phase. These products were not strictly in accordance with the invention as no activity enhancer was present, but the experiment was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of a gel phase containing system in delivering phenol to skin. An ordinary oil in water emulsion which does not contain a gel phase was prepared as follows A product having a gel phase and containing a solid wax was prepared as follows An emulsion having a gel phase and containing normally liquid oil having a dielectric constant of not more than 3.0 was prepared in the manner described for Test Product A, except that SIRIUS M85, 25 parts, the normally liquid oil was employed instead of paraffin wax. The phenol used in the preparation of each emulsion was C¹⁴ labelled phenol. Pieces of guinea pig stratum corneum were immersed in each of the above emulsions for 20 hours, after which they were removed, blotted dry and the amount of phenol retained by the corneum was measured by a radio tracer technique using a standard methodology. The results of these measurements were as follows It can be concluded from these results that delivery to skin of phenol, as an example of an amphiphilic compound, from a product is enhanced when a gel phase is present in the product. When the emulsion contains a normally liquid oil such as SIRIUS M85 Test Emulsion B then the amount of phenol delivered to the skin is doubled, whereas when a solid wax such as paraffin wax is present Test Product A , then the amount of phenol delivered to the skin is about three times that delivered from an ordinary emulsion Control . An experiment was conducted to compare the delivery to skin of 2 hydroxyoctanoic acid, as an example of an amphiphilic compound, from an aqueous solution with and without activity enhancers. These solutions are not products according to the invention, since no oil or normally solid emulsifier was present, but the experiment nevertheless was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of activity enhancers having the requisite cloud point elevation temperature in delivering 2 hydroxyoctanoic acid to the skin. The control and each of the test solutions comprised a 0.2M aqueous solution of 2 hydroxyoctanoic acid. The control solution contained no additives, while the test solutions each contained 5 by weight of a further additive, some which were activity enhancers as herein defined, in that they possessed the ability to elevate the cloud point of a 0.025M aqueous solution of polyoxyethylene 8 nonylphenyl ether by at least 10 C under the conditions defined herein, while other additives possessed cloud point elevation temperatures of less than 10 C. The ability of an additive to enhance the delivery to skin of 2 hydroxyoctanoic acid was measured in terms of the increase in extensibility of guinea pig foot pad stratum corneum following contact with each solution. In this experiment, pieces of guinea pig foot pad stratum corneum, equilibrated at a relative humidity of 65 , were immersed in each solution for 3 hours at 20 C, and then removed, blotted dry and re equilibrated at the same relative humidity. The extensibility of each piece of guinea pig foot pad stratum corneum was measured before and after this treatment in an extensiometer according to the method described in European Patent No.7785. The results of this experiment are tabulated below It can be concluded from these results that delivery to skin of 2 hydroxyoctanoic acid, as an example of an amphiphilic compound from an aqueous solution is greatly enhanced when the solution also contains an activity enhancer as herein defined is employed. It can be seen by inspection of the results tabulated above that each of test solutions 1 to 5, which contain additives at 5 w w possessing a cloud point elevation temperature of less than 10 result in an increase in stratum corneum extensibility which is less than that recorded with test solutions 6 to 10, which contain activity enhancers as herein defined. This supports the fact that the presence of an activity enhancer substantially increases the delivery to skin of the amphiphilic compound, bearing in mind that none of the additives when employed alone increases the extensibility of stratum corneum to any significant extent. The following formulations represent oil in water creams that can be used in the treatment of acne, and illustrate the benefit of an activity enhancer. The oil in water creams according to Examples 1, 2 and 3 were each prepared as follows The creams of Examples 1 and 3 with activity enhancers, and control creams based on the Example 1 and Example 3 formulations omitting activity enhancers and the 2 hydroxy octanoic acid, were each applied to the foreheads of a panel of 10 volunteer subjects, according to a statistically designed experiment. The area of forehead skin treated in each subject was 32cm² and the quantity of cream applied to this area was 0.0865g. In each case, the skin surface pH was measured at frequent intervals over four hours following application of the creams, and the cream pH value calculated in each case. From these results, it can be concluded that These conclusions provide further support for preference for a solid wax over a liquid oil even though both have a dielectric constant of not greater than 3 as shown in the foregoing experiments reported earlier in this specification.
