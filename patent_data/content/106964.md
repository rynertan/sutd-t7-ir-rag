# Method and apparatus for compensating CT images for truncated projections.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for compensating CT images for truncated projections created when an object extends beyond the field of view during the course of collecting a set of projections. Projections which have reference channel information influenced by the object are identified, and the reference channel information thereof replaced by more accurate information derived from unaffected projections. The zero and first order moments of the projection set are analyzed to better estimate the expected moments had the truncated projections not been truncated, and to use that information in completing the truncated projections. A closed form solution is used for convolution of the exten sions of the truncated projections to avoid substantial de lays in processing the final CT image.
