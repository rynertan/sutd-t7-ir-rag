# Mass spectrometer.

## Abstract
A mass spectrometer having a thermospray ion source, suitable for the analysis of liquid samples is disclosed. The source comprises a strongly heated atomizing nozzle 4 through which the sample is pumped into a spray chamber 5, 11 , and an aperture in a cone 26 , through which the ions pass through an electrostatic lens 15, 16, 17 into a region 23 in which a mass analyser is situated. Electrode means 27, 45 generate a repul sive electrostatic field which improves the efficiency of the transmission of ions through the hole in the cone 26 . The electrode is preferably situated downstream of the hole in cone 26 but may alternatively be disposed directly opposite to it. By further increasing the potential on the electrode 27, 45 , the nature of the ions passing through the hole in the cone 26 can be changed from largely adduct and cluster ions formed by associa tion of solvent molecules with sample ions in the thermospray to largely pseudomolecular sample ions similar to those formed by conventional chemical ionization.
