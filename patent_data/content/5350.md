# Terminal cover.

## Abstract
A cover 11 for a tubular terminal 19 having an axially extending wire receiving slot 21 , which cover 11 comprises a tube moulded in one piece from plastics material with a closed end 12 and an open, terminal receiving end, a wire receiving slot 13 terminating remote from the closed end 12 in a transversely extending slot 19 . A centrally located, axially extending stuffer 15 projecting internally from the closed end 12 for engagement with a wire 24 received in the slot 21 when the cover 11 is applied to the terminal 19 . A pair of tool receiving intersecting recesses 16 extend transversely of the axis on the exterior of the closed end 12 . A lug 17 is integrally joined to the closed end.

## Claims
Claims 1. A cover for a tubular terminal having an axially extending wire receiving slot, which cover comprises a tube moulded in one piece from plastics material with a closed end and a open, terminal receiving end, a wire receiving slot extending axially along the plastics tube from the open end and terminating remote from the closed end in a transversely extending slot, a centrally located, axially extending stuffer projecting internally from the closed end for engagement with a wire received in the slot when the cover is applied to the terminal, characterised in that a pair of tool receiving intersecting recesses 16 extending transversely of the axis are formed on the exterior of the closed end 12 . 2. A cover according to Claim 1, characterised in that a lug 17 is integrally joined to the closed end.

## Description
Terminal cover. The invention relates to a cover for a tubular terminal having an axially extending wire receiving slot. An object of the invention is to provide a cover which provides a reliable wire stuffing function. According to the invention a cover for a tubular terminal having an axially extending wire receiving slot, comprises a tube moulded in one piece from plastics material with a closed end and an open, terminal receiving end, a wire receiving slot extending axially along the plastics tube from the open end and terminating remote from the closed end in a transversely extending slot, a centrally located, axially extending stuffer projecting internally from the closed end for engagement with a wire received in the slot when the cover is applied to the terminal, a pair of tool receiving intersecting recesses extending transversely of the axis being formed on the exterior of the closed end. A specific example of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a perspective vitw of a cover according to the invention aligned with a single wire for application to a terminal Figure 2 is a cross sectional view of the terminal and cover after application of the cover to the terminal Figure 3 is a cross sectional view of the terminal and cover after insertion of two wires into the terminal and Figure 4 is a side view of a series of covers during application to a series of terminals. The cover ll comprises a tube moulded in one piece from plastics material and closed at one end 12. A wire receiving slot 13 extends axially of the tube from an open terminal receiving end and terminates remote from the closed end 12 in a transversely extending slot 14. A centrally located, axially extending, stuffer 16 projects internally from the closed end to a location adjacent the slot 14.A pair of tool receiving intersecting recesses 16 extending transversely of the tube axis are formed on the exterior of the closed end and an axially extending arcuate lug 17 having the same profile as the tube is integrally formed with the closed end. A terminal 19 for use with the cover is a stamped and formed metal tube adapted at one end to be mounted in a printed circuit board 23 and having a wire receiving slot 21 extending axially between the ends and intersected by a transverse slot 22 which divides the terminal into two wire receiving sections, one on each side of the slot 22, which have substantially independent wire clamping characteristics as described in our Great Britain Patent No. 1,463,830 8299 . In use of the cover, an insulated wire 24 is aligned with the slot 21 Figure 1 and the cover is pushed onto the terminal by a tool, such as a screwdriver having a cruciform head inserted in slots 16, so that the wire is received in slot 13, engaged by the suffer, and forced into the section of slot 21 remote from the printed circuit board. During insertion into the slot 21, the slot walls penetrate the insulation and establish electrical connection with the wire core.The wire is retained above the transverse slot 22 by abutment with the corners defined between slots 21 and 22, the section of slot 21 adjacent the printed circuit board being in unexpanded condition. Insertion of a second wire 25 into slot 21 pushes the first wire 24 past the slot 22 into the section of slot 21 adjacent the printed circuit board. The walls of the slot 13 provide strain relief for the connection. The engagement of the tool in the cruciform slots ensures correctly directed force is applied to the cover, particularly during initial application to the terminal reducing risk of damage to the terminal by faulty application. The cover may readily be removed from the terminal by gripping the lug 17 with a suitable tool such as a pair of pliers. As shown in Figure 4, a series of covers 11 may conveniently be integrally moulded with a flexible carrier strip 27 and applied to terminals 19 unequally spaced apart on a printed circuit board reducing handling difficulties.
