# Transmission shift control.

## Abstract
A shift mechanism for the gears of a transmission is disclosed having a pivotally mounted bushing assembly 43 . The bushing assembly defines an aperture. Positioned in adjacent, spaced apart relationship to the bushing assembly is means 61 for selectively engaging one of a plurality of gears in a transmission. A shift lever 25 is rotatably positioned in the aperture in the bushing assembly 43 . One end of the shift lever 25 is adapted for drivingly engaging the means 61 for selectively engaging one of a plurality of gears in a transmission, whereby rotating the shift lever selects the gear in the transmission and pivoting the shift lever engages the selected gear in the transmission.
