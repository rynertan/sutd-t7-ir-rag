# Signal processing apparatus for a video signal.

## Abstract
In order to provide a video signal for processing having an arbitrary amplitude frequency characteristic, maintaining flat the group delay frequency characteristic signal processing ap paratus is provided having a video signal input terminal 1 for feeding an input video signal a delay line 6 for delaying said input video signal a first transmission circuit 7 having a trans fer function G for processing the video signal delayed by said delay line a first time reversal circuit 54 for reversing the time sequence of said input video signal in a predetermined period a second transmission circuit 12 having the transfer function G for processing the time reversed signal from said first time re versal circuit a second time reversal circuit 55 for reversing the time sequence of the signal processed by said transmission circuit in said predetermined period an adder circuit 4 for adding the signal processed by said first transmission circuit and the time reversal signal from said second time reversed cir cuit and a control pulse generator 15 for producing a control pulse sequence to control said first and second reversal cir cuits. Other circuit configurations are disclosed employing dif ferent configurations of transmission circuits and time reversal circuits.
