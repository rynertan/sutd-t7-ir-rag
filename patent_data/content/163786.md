# Method of producing full colour images on aluminum.

## Abstract
A process for the production of full color, partial colored or two colored pictures, scenes, words, etc., on articles of aluminum or aluminum alloys. The process involves first forming a hard, dense, non colored anodic coating of be tween about 10 microns and 26 microns on aluminum or aluminum base alloys by anodizing the aluminum in an acidic aqueous electrolyte comprising sulfuric acid, a poly hydric alcohol of from 3 to 6 carbon atoms and an organic carboxylic acid containing at least one reactive group in the alpha position and coloring the coating by intimately con tacting the unsealed coating with a paper containing a dye or dyes capable of subliming and then heating the surfaces causing the dye to sublime and transfer to the unsealed anodic film.
