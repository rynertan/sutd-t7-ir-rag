# Combustion apparatus.

## Abstract
A combustion apparatus for combusting fuel in a combustion furnace 1 by utilizing air which is enriched with oxygen through an oxygen permselective membrane 5 and is fed via a first piping line 4 to the combustion furnace 1 by vacuum pump 6. The combustion apparatus comprised a bypass piping line 8 provided on the first piping line 4 with connecting the upstream side and the downstream side of the vacuum pump 6, and being equipped with a control valve 9, a second piping line 13 an end of which is connected with the first piping line 4 between the vacuum pump 6 and the oxygen permselective membrane 5, the other end of which is open to the atmosphere, and being equipped with a control valve 14, and a third piping line 11 an end of which is connected with the first piping line 4 between the vacuum pump 6 and the combustion furnace 1, the other end of which is open to the atmosphere, and being equipped with a control valve 12.
