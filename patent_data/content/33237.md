# Information gathering system multiplexing apparatus.

## Abstract
An information gathering system has a plurality of sen sors 14a to 14n whose outputs are passively multiplexed for transmission to a common receiver 17,18,19 . The sensors 14a to 14n are coupled to a common transmission line 13 by means of spaced couplers 15a to 15n to receive, modify and return a portion of a modulated carrier signal. The conse quent difference in propagation path lengths results in a sequence of time separable pulses being received at the receiver 17, 18,19 . The carrier signal may be an optical signal provided by a laser 11 , the transmission line an optical fibre 13 , and the sensor 14 to 14n reflective or transmissive acousto optic transducers.
