## Abstract
A handy pissbag wherein a blocking plate 7 extending from an upper portion of a rear wall 4 of a cylindrical receiving mouth 2 mounted on an upper opening of a bag receiving mouth 2 in a direction of a front wall 3 is provided so as to block a part of an opening of the receiving mouth 2 .

## Claims
CLAIMS A handy pissbag 1 comprising a bag 1 , a cylindrical receiving mouth 2 mounted on an upper opening of the bag 1 , and a blocking plate 7 extending from an upper portion of a rear wall 4 of the receiving mouth 2 in a direction of a front wall 3 so as to block a part of an opening of the receiving mouth 2 .

## Description
HANDY PISSBAG l A conventional handy pissbag comprises a bag 1 housing therein a water absorbing agent and a receiving mouth 2 mounted on an upper opening of the bag 1, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the receiving mouth 2 being composed of a cylindrical member 5 which is lowered in level gradually from a high front wall 3 towards a low rear wall 4 and an edge 6 extending outwardly from the upper end of the cylindrical member 5.. However, in the conventional handy pissbag of the type as described, urine remains adhered to the rear wall 4 during use, and there poses a disadvantage in that when the pissbag is removed, the urine adhered to the rear wall 4 possibly leaks out depending on a degree of inclination of the receiving mouth 2. It is an object of the present invention to 6 provide a handy pissbag which is free from the disadvantage noted above. A handy pissbag in accordance with the present invention is characterized by comprising a bag, a cylindrical receiving mouth mounted on an upper opening of the bag, and a blocking plate extending from an upper portion of a rear wall of the receiving mouth in a direction of a front wall so as to block a part of an opening of the receiving mouth. Other objects and features of the present invention will become apparent from the ensuing description in connection the drawings. Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a conventional handy pissbag Fig. 2 is a sectional view of the same Fig. 3 is a sectional view of a handy pissbag in accordance with the present invention and Fig. 4 is a plan view of the same. In accordance with the present invention, at the upper end of the rear wall 4, a blocking plate 7 extending by a predetermined length towards the front wall 3 so as to block a hole of the receiving mouth 2 is formed integral with the edge 6. Since the handy pissbag of the present invention is constructed as described above, it has a great advantage that in use, the urine adhered to the rear wall 4 remains stayed in a space between the rear wall and the blocking plate 7 even when the receiving mouth 2 is inclined, and therefore, no leak out of urine occurs. In the present invention, a substantial opening of the receiving mouth 2 becomes narrow by the provision of the blocking plate 7, and it is therefore preferable that the cylindrical member 5 be made sufficiently large in size in anticipation thereof.
