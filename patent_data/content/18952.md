# Coil assembly.

## Abstract
A coil assembly is formed by an elastic metal wire 2 helical extension spring coil having convolutions resiliently urged towards each other and held apart by spacers 4 pinched between the convolutions and held there by the spring back of the convolutions. The spacers can interspace the coil convolutions and be made to extend radially inwardly and outwardly beyond the inside and outside of the coil, so as to radially space the coil from a coil center and the inside of a tubular casing enclosing the coil. In this way a tubular radiant heater can be made by using electric resistance wire to form the coil and making the spacers from refractory insulating material.
