# Olefin polymerization catalyst compositions and a process for the polymerization of olefins employing such compositions.

## Abstract
An olefin polymerization catalyst composition comprising a a reaction product of an organo aluminium compound and an electron donor, and b a product obtained by contacting a solid component comprising a magnesium halide in which the atomic ratio of chlorine to magnesium is at least 1.2, a titanium halide and an electron donor, with a halohydrocarbon and with a tetravalent titanium compound.
