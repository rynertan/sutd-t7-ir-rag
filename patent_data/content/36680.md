# Method of marking a synthetic material surface.

## Abstract
A method of marking objects having a surface of a synthetic material and an object having the marked syn thetic material for the purpose of identification which method comprises exposing the surface of the synthetic material to a laser beam of light of intensity of at least 1000 kW cmÂ² at the surface of the material and wherein the synthetic material contains a dye and a silicon containing inorganic compound or a dye comprising silicon, such as, a sulphur containing sodium aluminium silicate which is decomposed to form a colour contrast mark on the surface on exposure to said laser beam.
