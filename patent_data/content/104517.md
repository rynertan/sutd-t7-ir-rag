# MILLING CUTTER AND INDEXABLE CUTTING INSERT THEREFOR

## Abstract
Disclosed is a milling cutter in which there is a cutter body having a plurality of insert pockets with each of the pockets having a back wall. There is also an indexable insert having opposed top and bottom surfaces joined by a peripheral wall to form a polygonal body when viewed in plan. The peripheral wall on each side of the insert forms a cutting edge at the juncture of one of the top and bottom faces and a clearance face on each side of the insert joins a peripheral wall and the other of the top and bottom faces. The milling cutter further comprises means for holding the insert in the pocket so that one of the top or bottom surfaces abuts the back wall.
