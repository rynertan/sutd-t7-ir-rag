# Recovery and towing vehicle.

## Abstract
A recovery and towing vehicle which has been specifi cally designed for transport in a freighter aircraft and must necessarily therefore be of low profile to fit within the cargo space of an air transport vehicle comprising a main chas sis 1 on which is mounted a cab 3 with a removable upper part 5 and a sewing crane 7 having an extendable boom 11 , a winch 10 and spades 23 mounted in slideways 29 . The vehicle also is provided with a traditional supported lift towing boom 25 but instead of being mounted for pivoting movement on the chassis 1 , the boom 25 is mounted for generally vertical sliding movement. For this purpose, slide ways 29 are provided on the inside of housing 31 for the spades and vertical movement of the boom 25 is under the control of the main crane boom 11 which can be connected to the boom 25 by means of a lift strop 41 . By providing for the boom 25 to be movable vertically in slideways rather than being pivotally mounted on the chassis, a low profile chassis can be provided and the vertical dimensions of the vehicle can be kept compact. The slideways 29 may be straight or arcuate, arcuate slideways having the advantage of providing increased lift. Such increased lift can also be achieved by inserting a spacer wedge 61 between an anvil 55 at the base of the mast 27 and an abutment surface 59 on the folding boom 33 .
