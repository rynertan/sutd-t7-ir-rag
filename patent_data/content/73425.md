# Dual photoelectric cell assembly.

## Abstract
A dual photoelectric cell assembly incorporating a uni tary dual element photoelectric cell having first and second light sensing areas, the assembly also including a plurality of light reflecting surfaces. The dual element photoelectric cell and the reflecting surfaces are potted in transparent potting compound in a transparent housing whereby light emanating from a first direction is reflected onto the first light sensing area of the dual element photoelectric cell and light emanating from a second direction is reflected onto the second light sensing area of the dual element photoelectric cell.
