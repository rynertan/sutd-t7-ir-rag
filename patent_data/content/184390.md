# Extrusion, conveyance and cutting system.

## Abstract
An apparatus 10 that extrudes, conveys and cuts a propellant strand 14 into precise lengths independent of strand velocity is disclosed. Cutting of the strand 14 is accomplished by a cutter 18 having a blade mounted on a shaft which in one revolution cuts the strand. The shaft is activated after passage of the strand end past a pair of downstream optic sensors P0,P1 , compensation is made for cutter delay and strand velocity by having cutting activation take place in the same amount of time as it takes the strand end to pass both sensors less cutter delay.
