# FULLY ENCLOSED CASE FOR BOTTLES

## Abstract
This invention relates to a fully enclosed packaging case c for packaging a group of articles such as bottles. The case comprises a sleeve 10 formed from paperboard or similar sheet material and which includes end closure panels 20, 22, 28, 30, 32 at each of its ends, the sleeve being adapted for tightening about the goup of articles, the tightening being accomplished by providing a gusset panel 46 in the top wall 12 of the sleeve. The gusset panel is folded downwardly and secured in overlapping relationship with the underside of an adjacent part of the top wall during the packaging operation so as to reduce the circumference of the sleeve. As a result a three ply strip of material is provided by two adjacent portions of the top wall with the gusset panel disposed therebetween so providing a strong handle area for the package.
