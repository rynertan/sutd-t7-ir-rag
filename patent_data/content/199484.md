## Description
The present invention relates to a medical system for extraction and analysis of a liquid in a body in particular, though not exclusively, it relates to a system for sampling and analyzing blood or any components of blood for specific readings as to qualities of the blood. One specific form of the present invention, for sensing the accumulation of blood glucose for diabetics, is a portable, pocket size, battery operated, diagnostic system. Prior art blood glucose devices have operated on the principle of taking blood from an individual by a variety of methods, such as by needle or lance. An individual then had to coat a paper strip carrying chemistry with the blood, and insert the blood coated strip into a blood glucose meter or visual comparison against a color standard. There are numerous blood glucose meters on the market, but they are bulky and not pocketable. The instruments usually have to be carried in a large handbag, or an individual s briefcase, or left at home such as in the bathroom or the bedroom. Further, the prior art medical apparatus for sensing blood glucose required that an individual have separately available a needle or lance for extracting blood from the individual, strips carrying blood chemistry for creating a chemical reaction with respect to the blood glucose and changing color, and a blood glucose meter for reading the change in color indicating the blood glucose level. The level of blood glucose, when measured by glucometer, is read from a strip carrying the blood chemistry through the well known process of reflectometers for glucose oxidation. Monitor reagent strip systems that are now available on the market have multiple sequential steps that the patient must follow at exact time intervals. Each step is subject to error by the patient. As in most monitors, it is the patient s responsibility to periodically calibrate the monitor against known color standards validate the efficacy of their reagent strips and technique by immersing the strips in a control solution of known glucose content and, then comparing the color change visually against the color standard or by using a calibrated monitor. In the prior art, the procedure for obtaining accurate results from the time a drop of blood is placed on a reagent strip pad to the time the pad color change is read in the monitor is as follows. The patient must stick himself herself with a lancet. A drop of blood must be squeezed to the surface of the skin. The drop of blood must then be carefully placed on the reagent pad, making sure to cover the pad completely and the pad must never be touched by the finger of the patient to prevent contamination. Once the sample has been applied to the surface of the reagent pad, the patient must press a timer on the monitor. At the end of the timing, the patient must wipe, blot or wash the strip off, using a careful technique. And for most strips, the patient must place the reacted reagent strip into the monitor, and press a test button or close a hatch to obtain results. Prior art commercially available comparable reagent strips or monitors require operator intervention in a prescribed sequence at exact time intervals. The prior art is subject to operator error, sequence, timing, and technique errors. The prior art reagent strips are also subject to contamination which will affect accuracy of measurement. The present invention overcomes the disadvantages of the prior art by providing a hand held pocketable medical system. The present invention, in a first aspect, provides a hand held pocketable measurement system which comprises first and second co operating apparatuses for extraction and analysis of a liquid in a body, whereby said first apparatus 30 comprises a pocketable housing member 32 including spring actuated hammer means 40 In a second aspect the invention provides a hand held pocketable measurement system which comprises first and second co operating apparatuses for extraction and analysis of a liquid in a body, whereby said first apparatus 30 comprises a pocketable housing member 32 including In a third aspect the invention provides a disposable diagnostic unit for use with a hand held portable measurement apparatus for extracting and analysing a component of a liquid within a body, whereby the diagnostic unit comprises In a fourth aspect the present invention provides a disposable sterile diagnostic unit for use in a pocketable medical diagnostic system comprising co operating apparatuses for sensing glucose in blood, said unit comprising In preferred embodiments the present invention includes an attachable disposable probe package carrying a chemical reagent chemistry for extracting blood from an individual, delivering the blood to the blood sensing reagent, or vice versa, in the disposable needle package, and resulting in a readout of a level such as blood glucose. The system includes a microcomputer which is software controlled by an internal program and, of course, provisions can be provided for external programming of the microcomputer. The computer controls all timing functions thereby eliminating human error. The medical system can also assume a rectangular shape and include a slidable diagnostic point for measuring any predetermined quantity which causes a reagent strip reaction. One general purpose of the present invention is a portable, shirt pocket size, battery operated diagnostic device system for use by health professionals and or lay patients for the detection and measurement of certain selected chemical agents or substances for the purpose of diagnosis and or treatment of disease. The application is not restricted to use with human beings. It may also be extended to veterinary medicine animals, and can also have uses in the agricultural field, such as measurement of glucose in grapes in the wine industry. One first application is for insulin dependent and non insulin dependent diabetics for the measurement of glucose in serum, plasma, and or whole blood. The particular quantity to be measured is glucose through the principles of either reflectance, absorption or potentiometric by electronic circuitry although other quantities can be measured. Another purpose of the present invention is to provide a hand held pocketable medical system or measurement system including an engaging disposable needle or lance probe carrying the blood sensing reagent for sensing readings of the blood, such as blood glucose level. The medical system is cost effective and simple to operate by an individual. The reading, such as an individual s glucose level, is displayed on an LCD display on the side of a tubular or rectangular like pen barrel of the medical system which approximates the size of an ordinary ink pen which can be carried in an individual s shirt pocket. The disposable needle probe packages can be carried in a corresponding hollow tubular pencil carrying a plurality of disposable probe packages for use as needed. The tubular or rectangular structure resembling a pen contains the hand held pocketable medical system, and the tubular or rectangular structure resembling a pencil carrier the extra supply of disposable needles. The pen and pencil design provides for the utmost peace of mind for the individual. According to one embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a hand held pocketable medical system including mechanical or electromechanical pen like structure for actuating a needle in a disposable needle or lance probe package, and for enabling a blood sample inside a finger or on the finger surface to be transferred to blood sensing reagent chemistry, or the blood sensing chemistry to be transferred to the blood. The mechanical structure can assume a variety of spring actuated configurations and can further create a vacuum for drawing the blood outside of the finger. The disposable needle probe package frictionally engages onto a socket at the bottom of the tubular hand held pocketable medical system such as by snapping, threading, or the like, in place, and is easily releasable and disposable after a single use. The hand held tubular medical system includes photosensing electronics connected to a microcomputer or custom integrated circuit not only for analyzing the properties of the blood sensing chemistry in the disposable probe package, but also for displaying a readout and storing previous readouts. The electronics includes a verification sequence verifying operability of the electronics including sending of a low battery condition, verifying the condition of an unused disposable needle package, verifying the presence of a blood sample and subsequently providing multiple readings to provide for an averaging of results. The result will not be displayed until the qualification sequence has been successfully sequenced through verification. According to other embodiments of the present invention there is provided a diagnostic unit with a wicking action where the wick serves as the transport mechanism for the blood. The wick could also serve as the sterility barrier for a sterilized needle lance. The wick can be at an angle to the needle lance and provides for absorption through the wick material. One significant aspect and feature of the present invention is a hand held pocketable medical system or measurement system referred to as a Med Pen or a Med Pen Mosquito which is used to extract a blood sample from the body, subject the sample to chemical analysis, and display the results to the individual. A disposable needle package, referred to as a Med Point carries the blood sensing chemistry consisting of a reagent strip, as well as the needle either for delivering blood to the reagent or for causing the reagent to be delivered to the blood. Additional disposable needle packages can be carried in a corresponding structure similar to that of the medical apparatus referred to as a Med Pencil. Another significant aspect and feature of the present invention is a pen like structure which is mechanical, and actuates upon a predetermined amount of pressure being exerted on the skin of an individual s finger. Upon this pressure being sensed, the needle will be actuated down through an individual s skin for the subsequent result of enabling a blood sample to be taken from within the finger or blood sample to occur on the surface of the finger. In an alternative, a button can be pushed actuating the probe into the skin. A further significant aspect and feature of the present invention is a hand held pocketable medical system referred to as Med Pen Mosquito which will provide blood glucose readings where the disposable needle probe package carries glucose oxidase or like chemical reagent, whereby once the blood undergoes a colorimetric or potentiometric action proportional to the blood glucose concentration, electronics through the reflectance colorimeter provide for subsequent processing of the photosensing of the blood chemistry for displaying of the results on an LCD display. A further significant aspect and feature of the present invention is a hand held pocketable medical system which can be utilized by an individual and only requires the engagement of a disposable needle probe package, subsequent actuation of the apparatus causing a subsequent display on a visual readout for the desired measurement. Another significant aspect and feature of the present invention is a measurement system which utilizes a slidable disposable diagnostic point unit. The diagnostic point unit carries a spring lance needle and a transport mechanism for transporting a fluid or liquid to a reagent strip. Having thus described embodiments of the present invention, it is a principal object hereof to provide a pocketable medical system, including disposable needle packages which carries blood sensing reagent which engage thereto providing a subsequent readout on a visual display of a quality of the blood. The medical system can be broadly extended to a system for measurement of a quantity of a substance in a particular fluid or material and is not to be construed as strictly limited to medical applications, as the system can be used in industry, agricultural, or even veterinary environments. One object of the present invention is to provide a hand held pocketable medical diagnostic system denoted as a Med Pen Mosquito, disposable medical probe as needle packages referred to as Med Points or Med Probes which engage onto the Med Pen, and a hollow tubular pencil referred to as a Med Pencil for carrying extra disposable needle Med Point packages. The disposable needle packages carry blood sensing reagent for sensing components of the blood for qualities such as glucose level. Other qualities of any substance can also include urea nitrogen, hemoglobin, alcohol, protein or other qualities of the blood or in other articles such as agricultural products, food, etc. Another object of the present invention is a Med Pen which is a reusable device containing the electronics and software programming, mechanical apparatus, battery s , sensor s , and related circuitry that cause the functional operation to be performed. The Med Point or Med Probe is a disposable device containing a needle lance to obtain a blood sample, typically from a person s finger or toe, and a chemical reagent that reacts with the presence of blood as a function of the amount of glucose present in blood. The chemical reagent is sealed inside the Med Point probe housing or inside a specific housing for the chemical reagent obviating the effects of contamination from fingers , moisture, and light, thus improving accuracy and precision of measurement by stabilizing the oxidation reduction or chemical reaction of the reagent prior to use. The sensor s in the Med Pen Point system measure detect via colorimetric and or potentiometric and or absorption analysis of the amount of glucose present. This analog data is converted to a digital readout display quantifying glucose in milligrams per deciliter mg dl or MMOL L. An additional object of the present invention is a self contained automatic system. Once the Med Pen Point is depressed against the finger or other area , no further operator intervention may be required depending upon the specific embodiment. All operations and performance of the system are performed automatically and mechanically electronically in the proper sequence. Accuracy and precision of the measurement is enhanced because errors due to operator interpretation, operator technique, and timing of events, are thereby removed from operator control and influence due to automatic operation. Pressure of the system against a skin surface of a predetermined amount based on spring constants or other predetermined conditions automatically starts the system and sequences the operations dependent upon the specific embodiment. Still another object of the present invention is a medical system which is software based and software intelligent. The system is self calibrating through control commands by the software. A still further object of the present invention is a measurement system with a slidable self cocking hammer, a push button, release button, and a battery carried in a top compartment. Other objects and many of the attendant advantages of the present invention will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference numerals designate like parts throughout the figures thereof and wherein The operation of the hand held portable medical diagnostic system 10 will now be described in detail, particularly with later reference to sensing of glucose for an insulin type of diabetic individual. This is by way of example and for purposes of illustration only and not to be construed as limiting of the structure or mode of operation of the present invention. Pushing button 36 loads inner actuator spring 44. The push button 36 locks in place by latch 47a and 47b and holds spring 44 in the compressed state as shown in FIG. 4. Diaphragm 49 is thereby compressed by diaphragm tensioner 51 which is a small projection on the central portion of core 34. By pushing the release tube 96 upward with an individual s finger, from which blood sample is to be taken, latches 76a and 76b are opened, and core 34 is forced downwardly by action of the inner actuator spring 44. Downward movement of core 34 drives the diaphragm housing core 46 with the probe 12 and needle 90 downwardly and simultaneously begins to load outer spring 42. Needle 90 punctures the finger. Downward motion of core 34 opens latches 47a and 47b so that push button 36 can return to its neutral position by being forced upward by further expansion of inner spring 44. Outer spring 42, coaxial to inner spring 44, then can push core 34 upwardly which releases the diaphragm 49, and creates a vacuum in diaphragm housing core 46. The vacuum draws blood up from ruptured capillaries in the finger through the needle 90 into the probe 92 whereupon the blood wets the reagent strip 94. Further upward movement of core part 34 pulls the diaphragm housing core 46 upward so that probe 92 and needle 90 retract from the finger. The diaphragm housing core 46 is then locked in place by the latch 76a and 76b, all mechanical action ends, and all elements are in a neutral position. The blood sample on reagent strip 94 is processed by chemical reaction inside reagent strip 94, and color change of strip is read from the opposite side of reagent strip 94 by reflection of light from LED 50 to the phototransistor 52. The signal is processed in electronics of FIG. 5 as later described in detail, and converted into a numeric value subsequently displayed on LCD 62 which reflects the glucose level of the blood sample. The disposable probe 12 is removed from the device by pulling of the probe causing the skirt of casing member 32 to expand, freeing the probe from the socket. Further operation of the system is now described. A user attaches a Med Point probe 12 to the Med Pen system 10 which accomplishes two functions. The first is the Med Pen and Med Point are engaged and made ready for use. The second is the sensor s can sense predefined color bands areas located inside Med Point as the pen and point are mated, thus automatically calibrating through an algorithm in the software. This self calibration ensures accuracy of measurement before each use eliminates the need for operator intervention and operator induced error verifies that the chemical reagent inside Med Point is the correct color, i.e., unreacted and, causes the Med Pen to provide a visual and or audible alarm if the calibration acceptance criteria in the software is not satisfied. The user places Med Pen Point on one s finger or other area from which blood sample is to be taken. The user pushes down one end of Med Pen and holds down until a tactile response indicates Med Pen Point may be removed. The tactile response may be in various forms such as mechanical click from detent action or even an audible beep. Med Pen Point performs all operations in the proper sequence and does not require user intervention. A blood sample is transported by vacuum and or capillary action to the chemical reagent, and or chemical reagent is transported to the blood sample on surface within finger or other areas. The vacuum is created by the mechanical action design of components in the Med Pen probe. The capillary action is created by the physical dimensional design of the Med Point probe as later described. An internal clock timer in the computer is initiated on pressure being exerted in the system. The chemical reagent reacts with blood glucose. The electronic sensor s can detect coloriometrically and or photoimetrically the amount of glucose present in the blood sample by measuring the change in color of the chemical reagent and or the conductivity impedance of the chemical reagent, respectively. The chemical reaction between the reagent and the blood glucose is time dependent. Multiple measurements are made at specified time intervals as dictated by an internal clock, thus achieving three results. There is improved accuracy due to the resolution of the measurements over shorter time intervals rather than a single measurement at x seconds as in the prior art. There is improved accuracy because multiple measurements can be averaged optionally throughout the high low readings, etc. for linear or non linear reactions and or equations. There is faster response time for operator use i.e., one doesn t have to wait 30 60 seconds for a reading. The system takes early readings and extrapolates. The Med Pen system electronics converts the analog data to digital format, and displays a quantitative digital readout of glucose in whole blood expressed in mg dl or MMOL L. The accuracy and precision of measurements is further enhanced because the chemical reaction of the chemical reagent is stabilized. The Med Point housing or self contained housing for the reagent chemistry can provide a barrier that insulates the chemical reagent from those parameters that accelerate the reaction i.e., light, moisture, contaminants from fingertips such as salt, fluoride, etc. The electronics operates on the reflectance colorimeter principal where the blood on the reagent strip undergoes a colorimetric or potentiometric reaction proportional to the blood glucose concentration. The electronics provides verification of the system, the chemistry of a reagent of an unused strip, the presence of a blood sample, and provides multiple readings to average the results. Several readings can be taken at specific intervals shortly after the blood reacts with the reagent strip. Once two measurements are made at two distinct time periods, the slope of the reaction of the chemistry can be calculated towards determining an actual final glucose value. In the alternative, the software of the microcomputer can control predetermined samplings at predetermined time intervals and average the result to determine the final glucose reading after a predetermined time period, such as 60 seconds. This improves the accuracy of the final reading. The readings can also be stored and either recalled by a switch on the side of the pen, or recalled by connecting the pen through an inner connecting cable to a personal computer for outputting the readings for specific times on specific days to a video display or stored for subsequent display or print outs. Pushing the button 132 downwardly loads spring 146 and locks button 132 in place by action of latch 158 in detent 137. Air inside button 132 is pushed out through core 136, the porous reagent strip 184, probe 186, and the needle 182. The finger from which blood sample is to be taken pushes the release tube 174 upwards, latch 158 is opened so that loaded actuator spring 146 can drive the core 136 down which loads spring 148 and drives needle 182 of probe 186 into finger. Needle 182 ruptures capillaries in finger. When the core 136 has moved all the way down, latch 154 clips into a detent 151 and releases the latch 152 from engagement at point 156. This releases button 132 which is forced back to the neutral position by spring 146. Upward movement of the button 132 creates a vacuum inside button 132 and the core 136 by action of rolling diaphragm 140, that vacuum then reaches probe 186 and needle 182 through porous reagent strip 184, thus sucking blood from capillaries in the finger into the needle 182 through the probe 186 so as to wet the reagent strip 184. Extension 160 of button 132 retracts latch 154 from detent 151 after a mechanical delay and finite time delay defined by distance between latch 158 and extension 160, thus releasing core 136 which is forced upwards by spring 148 which is then locked in place by latch 158. This action retracts probe 186 with needle 182 from finger. The blood sample on the reagent strip 184 reacts with the reagents in the reagent strip 184 and the resulting color change is read from the opposite side by optical sensor 172, whose signals are converted by electronics into a numerical readout on display which reflects the glucose level of the blood sample. Disposable probe unit 180 is then removed from device. The probe 234, needle 236, release tube 224, and reagent strip 238 are a single disposable unit which is inserted into the socket in the pen 200. Upward thrust of extension 218 at release tube 224 during insertion pushes spring tensioner 204 upward which loads spring 206. The disposable unit 234 locks into place by action of latch 222a and 222b. Upward thrust of a finger from which blood sample is to be taken opens junction 228a and 228b between release tube 224 and probe 234 because probe 234 stops at the fixed diaphragm housing core 214. Sudden release of the release tube 224 drives the needle 236 into the finger where it ruptures capillaries. At its upper stop, release tube 224 opens latch 220a and 222b on diaphragm tensioner 208 which is forced upward pulling diaphragm tensioner 208 which is forced upward pulling the diaphragm plunger 210 and the diaphragm 212 upward, thus creating a vacuum inside fixed diaphragm housing core 214. The vacuum reaches needle 236 through diaphragm housing core 214 and draws blood from the finger through the needle 236 which wets the reagent strip 238. The pen 200 has to be manually removed from the finger and reset by means of the slide button 216. The color change of reagent strip 238 is read from the opposite side by the optical sensor 240, and the electronics unit 242 converts the color change into a numerical read out on the display 248. Pulling upwardly on knob 306 loads actuator spring 332, and the plunger 310 then locks in place by latch 318. Disposable unit 340 consisting of the lance 330, probe 340 and reagent strip 344 insert into the system 300. The top end of lance 330 is held by lance holders 320. Pushing the button 314 releases the latch 318. The plunger 310 is forced down, hitting lance holder 320. The lance 330 punctures the finger and ruptures capillary blood vessels. By action of the spring 334, the lance holder 320 returns immediately to its neutral position, retracting the lance 330. Blood starts accumulating in the wound channel, and forms a drop on the skin s surface which is drawn into capillary duct 342 by capillary action. Blood rests on the reagent strip 344 and starts the chemical reaction. Color change is then read from the opposite side by the optical sensors 346 connected to the electronics unit 348. The electronics unit converts signals to a digital readout on display 350. One alternative embodiment of the present invention is that the blood chemistry can be positioned at the site of the blood rather than taking the blood to the blood chemistry reagent strip. Disposable structures can be provided which would snap in place, although a needle or capillary action would not be required in that the reagent strip would touch blood located on one s skin and commence the process. The mode of operation would be that as previously discussed in pushing the system downwardly so that the release tube would apply upper pressure causing a reagent strip to come into contact with the blood. While all of the previous embodiments have illustrated the blood flowing to the chemical sensing reagent strip, the alternative embodiment can take the reagent strip to the blood, such as by having the reagent strip positioned on a lower portion of the disposable probe. The permutations of whether the blood is taken to the reagent strip or the reagent strip is taken to blood, is illustrated in FIG. 18 in a flow chart diagram. The teachings of the present invention can be expanded such as by having the probe include structure for first pricking and bringing blood from below the skin to the surface of the skin, and then having structure for moving the reagent strip to the blood on the surface of the skin for subsequent transfer of the reagent strip to the blood. The disposable diagnostic point unit provides for personal hygiene and an infection barrier, in that the only part touching the patient is the wick portion of the diagnostic unit 602. The wick portion can be sterilized prior to usage and protected by at least one if not two foil covers 654 and 656 with peel off adhesives. The dimensions of the wick material, as well as the wick material itself, are chosen such as to transfer a minimal amount of fluid from the skin puncturing lance 640 to the reagent material 650. The reagent material 650 is of such a minimal size so as to provide a sufficient photodiode illumination, as well as viewing area. The lance 640 is driven by a hammer cocking mechanism, such as those previously described in FIGS. 4, 6, 7, 8, or 9, to a penetrable depth which can include two settings, one for a child and one for an adult. The specific setting requires deliberate action by an individual. The medical system itself is rectangular in cross section and light tight for accurate photodiode viewing. The battery housing 604 provides easy replacement of the batteries without even requiring any tools whatsoever. The sliding door 608 of the diagnostic point unit provides for 1. insertion and removal of either a protective cover or the disposable diagnostic point unit 2. cocking of the hammer mechanism and, 3. activation and setting of the electronics including, providing a power on condition, b automatic calibration of the electronics, c a provision for an audio beep from an acoustic piezo electrical transducer as illustrated in FIG. 5, and d a visual display of a power condition corresponding to graphics on the side of the system, as illustrated in FIG. 2. The relevant graphics, as well as the event, audio beeps and visual display are further described in FIGS. 22a and 22b with respect to the operation of the medical system or measurement system which are synonymous, and each providing a readout of quantity of a specific quality which is to be measured. When the hammer mechanism is armed by the sliding door, the push button provides for releasing of the hammer and driving of the lance into the finger once a disposable diagnostic point unit 602 has been inserted into the channels 611a and 611b and positioned into place. The protective cover must be removed, the sliding door moved downwardly and then upwardly to cock the hammer, as well as activate the electrical circuitry for self calibration as well as measurement, and subsequent insertion of a disposable unit for providing for release of the hammer cocking mechanism which further activates the electronics out of the calibration mode into the sensing mode for photodiode viewing and subsequent computation of the characteristics of the material. Previously, the electronics has provided for self calibration through measurement of a predefined color standard, as well as a battery check. After read out is provided of the quantity, such as the glucose level, a button can be pushed to provide the previous readings. The medical system of FIGS. 19 21 provide for slidable action of the disposable diagnostic point unit 602 into a channel, slidable action of a sliding door 608 for the actuation of the electronics, as well as cocking of the hammer, and a push button 610 action for actuation of the hammer. The wicking unit 648 can include the adhesive back foil which stabilizes the enzyme in the reagent. The wick 648 can also act as a sterility barrier. The wick can be embedded into a capillary tunnel which operates under an absorption principle. The lance 640, which connects into the housing 630, will include a spring action which is dependent upon the spring modulus of the lance or needle, which includes a right angle or other angular bend between the spring arm and the point. The wicking material 648 will be adjacent to pick up and transporting of the blood from the lance 640 or needle to the reagent strip 652 through a filter 650 for red blood cells. While the wick 648 has been disclosed as having an aperture 638, depending upon the type of specific wicking material, it may not be necessary to have an aperture in the material as the lance 640 or needle could puncture through the wick 648. FIGS. 22a and 22b illustrate a flow chart including corresponding column entries to graphics of FIG. 2 events audio beeps, as well as visual displays corresponding to the electronics of FIG. 5 and the duration, as well as application notes. The events, as well as the display duration and application notes, are explanatory in operation of the medical system or measurement system. The system performance chart provides for operational events of the system. Finally, the wicking action can have a dual purpose in that the wick material can provide a filter media for separating components of a liquid or fluid, in addition to being a sterility barrier for a sterilized needle or lance. One such example of the wicking material acting as a filtering media may be where the wicking material separates certain components of the blood from other components of the blood, by way of example and for purposes of illustration and not to be construed as limiting of the present material. The wicking material can serve more than one purpose, such as wicking for transporting of fluid to chemistry such as a reagent strip, but also can serve as a filter, as well as a sterility barrier.
