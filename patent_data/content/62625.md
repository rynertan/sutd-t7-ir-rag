# Process for the production of vinyltoluene.

## Abstract
A process for the production of vinyltoluene, comprising the steps of producing a crude vinyltoluene product by the catalytic dehydrogenation of ethyltoluene removing compounds from the crude vinyltoluene product which have a higher molecular weight than vinyltoluene to form a prepurified crude vinyltoluene product and fractionally distilling the prepurified crude vinyltoluene pro duct in a distillation apparatus to recover purified vinyltoluene. The higher molecular weight compounds removed are com pounds which foster the conversion of vinyltoluene into cross linked polymer. The compounds removed preferably have more than 11 carbon atoms. In one embodiment, the step of removing higher molecular weight compounds comprises condensing a vaporous crude vinyltoluene product to form a crude vinyltoluene solution, and subjecting the crude vinyltoluene solution to flash distillation to form a vaporous prepurified crude vinyltoluene product. Optionally, the prepurified crude vinyltoluene in the distillation apparatus may include a polymerization inhibitor.
