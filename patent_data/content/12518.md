# Articulated fluid transferring apparatus.

## Abstract
An apparatus for transferring oil or other fluid in an offshore loading system comprises a vertical column 10 pivoted to a base 12 on the ocean floor, and held vertical by a buoy 23 , and a loading arm 36 supported at the upper end of the column. The loading arm has an inboard rigid conduit member 40 pivoted about a horizontal axis at its inner end to the column and an outboard rigid conduit member 41 pivoted about mutually perpendicular axes at its inner end to the outer end of the inboard conduit member. The outer end of the outboard conduit member includes a valve 119 and a universal joint 108 by which the outboard member can be coupled to a manifold on board a ship to be loaded. The apparatus is operable by power operating means on board the ship.
