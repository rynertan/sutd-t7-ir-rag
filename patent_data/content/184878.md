# Colour cathode ray tube in line electron gun structure incorporating deep saddle accelerating electrode.

## Abstract
In a color cathode ray tube having an in line electron gun with overlapping CFF lenses, the accelerating electrode apertu res are critically enlarged to deepen the saddles between adja cent apertures in order to balance the asymmetry of the lensing field caused by the focusing electrode, and eliminate beam spot distortion at the screen due to field asymmetries in the focus region.
