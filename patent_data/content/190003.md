## Description
UV ABSORBING POLYMERS AND PHOTOGRAPHIC MATERIALS CONTAINING THEM The present invention relates to UV absorbing polymeric latices and their use in photographic photosensitive materials. Photographic photosensitive materials, particularly colour materials often contain a layer comprising gelatin and a UV absorber. Frequently this is an overlayer positioned farther from the support than any of the other layers of the material. A UV absorbing compound which has been used for this purpose has the formula EMI1.1 It has been observed that this compound is liable to crystallise out which results in migration of the compound to the surface causing an undesirable blooming effect. British Patent Specification 1,346,764 describes the use of a UV absorbing copolymer latex dispersed in a gelatin solution and coated to form aUV absorbing layer. One of the polymers specified therein has repeating units of the formula EMI1.2 This polymer has spectral absorption characteristics that allow some unwanted UV radiation to be transmitted. The present invention provides polymericUV absorbers which are free from the blooming referred to above. The present polymer comprises theUV absorbing moiety linked to the polymer backbone by an ether linkage and its absorption characteristics are improved over the prior polymer referred to above. Figure 1 shows a comparison of the absorption spectrum of monomeric UV absorber 1 see Example 3 below and polymer 2 c of the present invention seeExample 2 when coated at equal weights on transparent supports. It can be seen that the polymer 2 c has a higher extinction coefficient and sharper cutting long wavelength edge. This can provide increased protection against UV while not absorbing as much blue.Indeed, a similar comparison, but coated on a support containing an optical brightener, showed that the polymeric UV absorber did allow the desired fluorescence while the monomeric UV absorber did not. According to the present invention there is provided a UV absorbing homo or copolymer having repeating units of the formula EMI2.1 wherein R represents one or more halogen atoms or alkyl or alkoxy groups of l 4 carbon atoms and R2 represents one or more halogen atoms or alkyl or alkoxy groups of l 4 carbon atoms, the benzene ring A being optionally substituted. A preferred UV absorbing polymer contains repeating units of the formula EMI3.1 Copolymers according to the present invention may contain, in addition to repeating units of formulaII, repeating units derived from styrene, methyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate, vinyl acetate andlor 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropane sulphonic acid, and other similar monomers known in the art. The present polymers are conveniently prepared as latices by methods of polymerisation, in themselves known, in the presence of a surfactant and an initiator. The surfactant can be ionic but is preferably non ionic and those sold under the trade names OLIN lOG, SOLURIN PEN 95, DEREPHAT 154, TRITON X100 and TRITON X200E are suitable. The initiator may, for example, be sodium metabisulphate potassium persulphate or azo bisyanovaleric acid. The present latex polymers preferably have a particle size below 50 nm, especially 25 nm or below. The present invention further provides a photosensitive photographic material comprising a support, at least one photographic silver halide emulsion layer and a gelatin layer having dispersed therein particles of a polymer or copolymer according to the present invention. The advantages of using the latex UV absorber compared to the prior art monomeric absorber without affecting developability or abrasion sensitivity are as follows 1 Does not bloom 2 Can be coated in supercoat 3 Six layers instead of seven 4 Protection for whole pack 5 Better gloss 6 Little or no wet haze 7 Higher Dmax and upper scale contrast in all layers Reflection densitometry 8 All aqueous coating 9 Equivalent or improved light stability.Since the UV absorbing layers show minimum wet haze this allows, for example, wet prints to be assessed before drying. In addition the shape of the nearUV absorption curve is highly desirable leading to excellent protection from the deleterious effects of UV radiation. The silver halide emulsions contained by the photographic materials of the present invention may contain negative working or direct positive silver halide emulsions. Illustrative useful emulsions are disclosed in Research Disclosure, Vol. 176, December 1978, Item 17643. The use of high aspect ratio tabular grain silver halide emulsions, as disclosed inResearch Disclosure, Vol. 225, January 1983, Item 22534, is specifically contemplated. ResearchDisclosure and Product Licensing Index are publications of Kenneth Mason Publications Limited,Emsworth, Hampshire POlO 7DD, United Kingdom. The layers of the photographic material can be coated on any conventional photographic support.Typical photographic supports include polymer film, wood fibre, e.g., paper, metallic sheet and foil, glass and ceramic supporting elements provided with one or more subbing layers to enhance the adhesive, antistatic, dimensional, abrasive, hardness, frictional, antihalation, andior other properties of the support surfaces. Typical useful supports are further disclosed in Research Disclosure, Item 17643, cited above, Paragraph XVII. The photographic elements can, of course, contain other conventional additives known In the art as described in Research Disclosure, Item 17643, cited above. The present photographic materials may be multilayer colour materials forming images by reacting coupling a colour developing agent e.g. a primary aromatic amine in its oxidised form with a dye forming coupler. The dye forming couplers can be incorporated in the photographic elements, as illustrated by Schneider et al, Die Chemie, Vol. 1944, p. 113, U.S. Patent 2,304,940, 2,269,158, 2,322,027, 2,376,679, 2,801,171, 3,748,141, 2,772,163, 2,835,579, 2,533,514, 2,353,754 and 3,409,435, and Chen ResearchDisclosure, Vol. 159, July 1977, Item 15930. The dye forming couplers upon coupling can release photographically useful fragments, such as development inhibitors or accelerators, bleach accelerators, developing agents, silver halide solvents, toners, hardeners, fogging agents, antifoggants, competing couplers, chemical or spectral sensitizers and desensitisers. Development inhibitor releasing DIR couplers are illustrated byU.S. Patents 3,148,062, 3,227,554, 3,733,201, 3,617,291, 3,703,375, 3,615,506, 3,265,506, 3,620,745, 3,632,345, 3,869,291, 3,642,485, 3,770,436 and 3,808,945 and U.S. Patents 1,201,110 and 1,236,767. DIR compounds which do not form dye upon reaction with oxidised colourdeveloping agents can be employed, as illustrated by German OLS 2,529,350, 2,448,063, and 2,610,546 and U.S. Patents 3,928,041, 3,958,993, 3,961,959, 4,049,455 and 4,052,213. DIR compounds which oxidatively cleave can be employed, as illustrated by U.S. Patents 3,379,529, 3,043,690, 3,364,022, 3,297,445 and 3,287,129. The photographic elements can incorporate coloured dye forming couplers, such as those employed to form integral masks for negative colour images, as illustrated by U.S. Patents 2,449,966, 2,521,908, 3,034,892, 3,476,563, 3,519,429, 2,543,691, 3,028,238 and 3,061,432 and U.K. Patent 1,035,959 andlor competing couplers, as illustrated by U.S. Patents 3,876,428, 3,580,722, 2,998,314, 2,808,329, 2,742,832 and 2,689,793. Combinations of UV absorbers are also useful. For example, the UV absorbers according to the invention can be used in combination with at least one of the UV absorbers known in the photographic art, such as one or more of the UV absorbers described in, for example, European Patent Application 57160 U.S. 4,540,656 U.S. 4,431,726 U.S. 3,253,921 U.S.4,464,462 and U.S. 4,455,368. The UV absorber according to the invention can be in any location in a photographic element which enables the desired characteristics, including desiredUV absorbing properties. For example, the UV absorber can be in any layer or combination of layers of the photographic element however, the UV absorber is particularly advantageous in an overcoat layer and or in one or more of the layers of the photographic element farthest from the support. The following Examples are included for a better understanding of the invention.Example 1 2 F 2 hvdroxy 4 vinyl benzyloxyhenyl ibenzotriazole MonomerI A solution of sodium nitrite 55.2 g in 3 water 100 cm was added dropwise to a stirred suspension of o nitroaniline 110.4 g in concentrated 3 hydrochloric acid 640 cm keeping the temperature below 0 C.

The absorption spectra of the resulting coatings are shown in Fig. 2 of the accompanying drawings. It can be seen that the presentUV absorbing latex has superior absorption properties in the critical 350400 nm region. Below 350 nm, the film base itself starts absorbing UV radiation.Example 5 In order to compare the smoothness of theUV absorbing layer, coatings of the format described in Example 4 were made. Coating a contained 4.3 mg dm2 UV absorber 1 in layer 6 while coating b contained 4.3 mg dm2 of a UV absorbing polymer closely similar to 2 c of Example 2. Both coatings also contained 4.3 mg dm2 UV absorber 1 in layer 4.Surface gloss was measured on the Gardiner Glossmeter. The results were as follows Coating Gloss value a 94.7 b 102.1It can be seen that the UV absorbing polymer imparts superior gloss in comparison to the conventional monomeric UV absorber 1 when each is placed in the top coated layer. This also results in higher measured maximum reflection densities, particularly for the yellow image areas. Example 6 Colour image transfer receiver materials were prepared according to the following format in order to compare the latex UV absorber with a control dispersion containing a 3 1 by weight mixture ofUV absorbers 1 and 2. The latter requires a gelatin overcoat to prevent blooming and haziness due to crystallization of the UV absorber mixtures.
