## Description
GLASS CERAMIC MATERIALS AND THE USE THEREOF IN THERMAL SENSORS The present invention is concerned with novel glass ceramic materials which are electrically conductive and which undergo a dramatic negative resistance change with increasing temperature, such change being totally reversible. The present invention is also concerned with the use of these basic glass ceramic materials, employing certain micro techniques to produce highly accurate and very dependably reproducible thermal sensors. It is known to produce thermal sensors from a wide variety of semiconductive materials, examples of such materials including ferric oxide, nickel manganite, cobalt oxide, silicon, germanium, manganese ferrite and the like. In particular, hot processed oxide compositions based upon transition metal oxides have been used to form thermistor type devices and devices based upon doped silicon have been used as negative temperature coefficient resistors. In the field of thermistors, techniques for hot forming transition metal oxide compositions are well known, examples of material types being given inU.S. Patent Specifications Nos. 2,274,592 2,282,944 2,298,679 2,219,365 and 2,274,830. It is well known in the art of thermistor fabrication that reproducibility and matching between devices is a difficult and expensive process, variable stoichiometry and the presence of impurity dopants often affecting the resistivity of the base material oxide composition. The selection of thermistors by category, using such oxide composition, have been embodied using either statistical sorting techniques or the matching of resistance temperature curves.Examples of these techniques are given in U.S. PatentSpecification No. 3,109,227. Generally, thermistors are manufactured to a fairly wide tolerance, for example 15 from device to device, and are selected by the aforementioned techniques into percentage tolerance band and resistance temperature curve matched categories.Such selected thermistors may have very tight tolerances, for example 0.5 from device to device, and may track identically or almost identically within a specified temperature range. Such devices are desirable where the replacement of a sensor may affect circuit operation, unless the replacement is virtually identical to the replaced sensor. Furthermore, thermistor devices are generally bulk devices having relatively large thermal masses and have correspondingly long response times and a low sensitivity to small temperature changes. It is an object of the present invention to provide a means whereby many identical thermal sensing devices may be produced upon a substrate formed of a semi conducting glass ceramic composition, such glass ceramic materials being produced initially as an isotropic glassy material, the structure, specific resistivity and resistance temperature characteristics of which may be accurately controlled by specific treatment and processing. Another object of the present invention is to provide a means whereby highly accurate differential thermal sensors or a plurality of sensors in the form of a matched array may be produced. Differential thermal sensors are virtually unknown in a close tolerance matched form since the required tracking of resistance temperature, thermal mass and radiation incidence factor are usually unobtainable in commercially produced devices, for example in devices of the thermistor type. A further object of the present invention is to provide a means whereby multiple, high accuracy thermal sensors may be fabricated upon a substrate of semiconducting glass ceramic material. A further object of the present invention is to provide a means whereby the surface resistivity and bulk resistivity to a desired depth, together with the resistance temperature characteristic of a specified glass ceramic substrate1 may be controlled and modified by means of gaseous chemical diffusion process applied to the substrate material. A further object of the invention is to provide a means for trimming the resistance of a thermal sensor to any level of tolerance matching at a specified temperature or range of temperature. Thus, according to the present invention there is provided a glass ceramic material, which material, broadly defined, has the following composition by weight a. transition metal oxides 5 60 e.g. titanium dioxide, nickel oxide, vanadium pentoxide, zinc oxide, manganese dioxide, ferric oxide b. alkaline earth metal oxides 2 33 e.g. calcium oxide, magnesium oxide, barium oxide, strontium oxide c. alkali metal oxides 0.7 16 e.g. lithium oxide, sodium oxide, rubidium oxide, potassium oxide d. glass forming oxides 3.7 404 0 e.g. phosphorus pentoxide, silicon dioxide, aluminium oxide1 boric oxide e. modifying oxides 0 39 e.g. manganese oxide, zirconium oxide1 uranium oxide, silver oxide, stannic oxide The components from which the glass ceramic material is formed may be in the form of oxides or preferably in the form of co precipitated phosphates or hydroxides, or hydrated oxides, or in the form of a compound which decomposes to give the required oxide upon thermal dissociation in an oxidising atmosphere, for example nitrates, carbonates, phosphates, oxalates, formates, malonates or the like, or in the form of an ammonium complex, for example ammonium phosphate.Generally speaking, materials of the highest commercial purity are required for the production of the glassy material, which is the precursor of a semiconducting glass ceramic substrate. Two specific examples of the glass ceramic material according to the present invention, which can be used as precursors for semiconducting glass ceramics, have the following compositions, which are given as a practical embodiment of the base material as formed from the melt given as stable oxides Composition AN sodium oxide Na20 13.6 parts by weight ferric oxide Fe 203 27.16 parts by weight zinc oxide ZnO 17.55 parts by weight titanium dioxide TiO2 13.23 parts by weight phosphorus pentoxide P205 19.70 parts by weight stannic oxide Sn02 1.27 parts by weight manganese dioxide Mn02 0.000250 parts by weight cobalt oxide CoO 0.000065 parts by weight vanadium oxide V205 48.5 parts by weight barium oxide BaO 2.0 parts by weight Composition B sodium oxide Na20 17.69 parts by weight ferric oxide Foe203 0.57 parts by weight zinc oxide ZnO 21.78 parts by weight titanium dioxide TiO2 13.00 parts by weight phosphorus pentoxide P205 24.29 parts by weight stannic oxide SnO2 0.06 parts by weight manganese dioxide MnO2 0.000030 parts by weight cobalt oxide CoO 0.000045 parts by weight vanadium oxide V205 60.62 parts by weight barium oxide BaO 2.00 parts by weight Composition A gives a high substrate resistivity material, whereas composition B gives a low resistivity substrate material. Generally, in melting the above compositions, co precipitated phosphates and hydroxides are employed, rather than stable oxides, in order to attain a high degree of admixture of the base constituents.Techniques for admixing these components include milling, shearing and comminution and are well known within the ceramics industry. In addition, it is necessary to increase the amount of phosphoric oxide in the composition to compensate for volatile loss of this oxide at elevated melting temperatures. An increase in the amount of phosphoric oxide also enables the glass phase to form at a lower melting temperature and thus gives some degree of stability to the glassy phase. Typically, the phosphoric oxide content can be increased by 10 30neo prior to furnace operations. Melting of the components as outlined above is preferably carried out in an oxidising atmosphere at a temperature of from 1200 to 17800C. Following adequate melting procedures to assure homogeneity of the melt, the glass is cooled rapidly by pressure chilling. A rate of cooling of approximately 600 to 10000C. per second is required to stabilise the glass phase. The chilling operation is carried out by pressing a gob of molten glass composition between two rapidly closable platens held at a temperature of from 330 to 4700C. A preferred form of cooling is by pressure chilling using a compound platen formed from vertically oriented copper beryllium alloy strips held by tie bolts and having a flat milled surface, which surface contacts the glassy material during the pressure chilling operation. Thus, the glassy material can be obtained in the form of vitreous discs of up to 100 mm. in diameter and from 1 mm. to 2 mm. thickness, without separation or crystallisation, and are then cooled from between 300 0C. and 450 0C. to ambient temperature in order to anneal and alleviate strain in the glass discs so produced. The preferred rate of cooling is 70C. per minute or less. The cooled glass discs are then formed by an edge grinding operation to give a true circular shape.This enables easy mounting of the discs and avoids angular edges which may initiate crack propagation in subsequent processing. About twelve such discs can be produced from a 1 kg. scale melt. The discs of glassy material are then ground roughly flat on one side, using a wet silicon carbide slurry on a rotating table, This allows the discs to be set up on accurate grinding and polishing jigs.The discs are then further ground and lap polished on a pitch fixture. The tolerance on parallelism should be in the order of 30 secs. per arc. across a 100 mm.diameter glass disc and the surface roughness of the order of 4 5 wavelengths of sodium light. The discs of glass are thus ground to a final thickness of about 0.5 mm. Following the grinding and lapping operations, the discs are cleaned and then laid upon a flat inert foil, such foil preferably being a relatively inert material, such as a platinum or nickel foil, or a metal film which has been deposited by vacuum techniques on to a low expansion substrate, for example sintered alumina, or laid on a polished silicon nitride disc of high density. The discs of glass are then loaded into a tube furnace or other appropriate furnace and subjected to a heat ceramising process to develop a fine grained crystalline structure of the desired type. Typically, the exact profile of time and temperature to which the discs are subjected is ascertained by experimental techniques which are well known in the art of glass ceramic production. According to the present invention, within the glass ceramic there are developed oxide phases, which often exhibit nonstoichiometry and composing Magneli and other phases of transition metal oxides and mixed oxide products, bound in a phosphate rich glassy matrix. Such a glassy matrix consists of transition metal phosphate and alkaline metal phosphate glass phase species which may or may not themselves be semiconductive. Where a high temperation of operation of the finished thermal sensor is envisaged, it is necessary to ensure that electronic conduction is attained rather than ionic conduction or electrolyte conduction.At this stage in the processing of the glass ceramic wafer, it may be necessary to remove ionic constituents from the surface of the glass ceramic by a leaching process.Leaching can be carried out by racking the wafers in a silica jig and boiling in 1N sulphuric acid for 2 to 30 hours. This operation is important, especially where the lower resistivity glass ceramic sensors are to be operated at a relatively high temperature, for example 4000C., under a high D.C. bias since ionic migration may alter the characteristics of the device over such a period of time. The leached or unleached wafers are then subjected to chemical modification of the surface. This is attained by loading the wafers of glass ceramic on to polished silicon nitride jigs which allow the discs to lie perfectly flat. The jig is placed in a gas flow atmosphere furnace capable of operation at a temperature of from 350 to 9000C. A gaseous atmosphere is utilised which is capable of modifying the temperature resistivity and curve characteristics of the surface layer to a depth of 10 20 microns of the glass ceramic wafer to give a desired end result. Such an atmosphere is preferably a three or four component mixture, for example as follows Component A An inert gas, for example argon, helium or the like, or a mixture of inert gases.Component B A reducing gas, for example hydrogen or ammonia, or a mixture of reducing gases1 carbon monoxide, methane or the like.Component C A vaporised organometallic compound of compounds of a transition metal, for example dicobalt octacarbonyl, manganese carbonyl or nickel carbonyl, or a mixture thereof.Component D A modifying gas, for example diborane, nitrogen or the like, or a mixture of modifying gases. A preferred gas mixture for use in the atmosphere furnace has the following composition hydrogen 4.50SO by volume nitrogen 95.45 by volume dicobalt octacarbonyl 0.04 by volume nickel carbonyl 0.01 by volume The time and temperature of exposure determines the resultant specific resistivity and curve characteristic of the substrate material. The above gas composition gives both a reductive effect and a chemical modifying effect and allows good control over the surface resistivity of the substrate. If desirable1 components C or D or both may be terminated from the gas supply during processing to give a further purely reductive effect.Thus, a semiconductive layer is produced upon a higher resistivity substrate seeFig. 1 of the accompanying drawings, in which 1 indicates a glass ceramic substrate or wafer, 2 indicates a reduced semiconductive layer and 3 indicates the direction from which chemically modifying gases diffuse into and react with the surface bulk material at a rate determined by time temperature concentration . Thus, a glass ceramic composition having the aboveComposition A may have an initial resistivity in the region of 3.5 x 108 ohm cm. prior to processing in the atmosphere furnace and a resistivity of as low as 7.7 x 104 ohm cm. after processing. After the gaseous treatment is finished, the wafers are allowed to cool to ambient at a rate of 7 per minute to allow annealing. It may be necessary at this stage to repolish the surfaces of the glass ceramic wafer, generally where the Tg of the glass phase has been exceeded. A metallic coating is then applied to each wafer by vacuum metallisation, metals which can be used including aluminium, nickel chromium and nickel chromium gold. This process applies a metallised surface which ultimately provides contacts and a device structure upon the finished thermal sensor. After metallisation, the wafers are spin or dip coated with an appropriate photoresist material, whereby exposure to ultraviolet light or to an electron beam may be employed via an appropriate photomask, to define a desired patterned structure upon the photoresist, corresponding to the ultimate contact area and electrode structure of the thermal sensor. The photoresist is developed and stripped from the wafer and the exposed metallisation is then removed by etching to leave delineated ohmic contact structures and a defined electrode pattern upon the surface of the wafer. Generally. a photoresolution of 10 to 25 microns is adequate for high precision sensors. Thus, on a 100 mm. diameter wafer, many thousands of devices and contact structures may be formed. Five preferred embodiments of such structures are shown inFig. 2 of the accompanying drawing in which Fig. 2 a is a cube structure comprising a glass ceramic chip 21 having a metallised surface 22, Fig. 2 b is a bar structure with a semiconductive surface 23 on a glass ceramic chip 24, Fig. 2 c is an annular structure,Fig. 2 d is an interdigitated structure with a metallisation pattern 25 on the surface thereof andFig. 2 e is a differential interdigitated structure.The wafer is then scribed by means of a diamond scriber and cracked into single, dual or multiple devices, in the form of small chips, for example, with dimensions of 1.2 mm. x 1.2 mm. The device structures are determined with respect to substrate resistivity, response time and radiation interception of the factor of the finished sensor. Thus, by means of the processing outlined above, many small chips of semiconductive material can be produced having any desired resistivity and resistance temperature curves, which are uniform in size, contact delineation and physical properties. Devices thus produced may have a resistance at 20 C. as high as 100 Megohm or as low as 1 K ohm, depending upon the chosen processing parameters. The tolerances in terms of resistivity and curve factor of the devices produced from the glass ceramic wafer are reduced to a far lower level than that attainable with conventionally produced thermistor type thermal sensors, where a device may consist of a bead, disk or other structure of oxide composition. As mentioned hereinbefore, a preferred embodiment of the present invention is in the form of differential heat sensor, a simple form of which can consist of a dual thermal sensor, as illustrated in Fig. 3 of the accompanying drawings comprising an insulating glass ceramic 31 with a semiconductive glass ceramic 32 thereon, having a scribed groove separator 33, a metallisation pattern 34 and leadout wires 35, the overall length of which can be, for example, 1.5 mm.Because of the excellent matching of the devices, the problem of device selection may be eliminated. When produced as chips, the glass ceramic devices are capable of being mounted in any desirable manner. Generally, contacts or leadouts are provided on such devices by means of gold or aluminium or other metallic wire ultrasonically bonded to the ohmic contact area delineated upon the surface of the device. Furthermore, single, dual or multiple devices may be mounted or encapsulated in a package having a silicon, germanium, polyvinylidene fluoride or other infra red transmissive window, whereby the device may be utilised as a low cost alternative to pyroelectric sensors in applications such as intruder detection, thermal scanning, hot object detection and fire flame explosion detection. In laboratory tests, a differential device was found to be capable of detecting the presence of a human body at a distance of two metres without collecting optics, a schematic example of such a device being illustrated in Fig. 4 of the accompanying drawings, comprising a differential device 41, an infrared transmissive window 42, a glass screen 43, a differential amplifier 44, an output 45 to an indicator or alarm and a balance control 46, a source of infra red radiation being indicated by arrows 47. Devices produced from glass ceramic materials according to the present invention are extremely stable and may be used, for example, to detect heat emission or to measure temperature in, for example, the range of from 800C. to 60O0C., depending upon the specific processing applied to the substrate. A graphical representation of a resistance temperature curve of a single device is given in Fig. 5 of the accompanying drawings, the curve not being corrected for newtonian cooling. In principle, the chhracteristics of the device may be varied by the starting composition of the glass, the specific processing applied to the glass ceramic and the device delineation and structure. A further method of trimming a device to a highly accurate resistance value is by laser trimming of an ancillary device structure. A pulsed YAG laser operating at about 100 pps was found to be effective in trimming devices to within 0.05 accuracy or better. AS drawing of a typical device structure is given in Fig. 6 of the accompanying drawings. in whichA is prior to trimming and B being after trimming, a sensor chip being indicated by 61, metallisation by 62 and points from which metallisation has been removed by 63. Great care must be taken to remove heat introduced by the laser pulses. A fast circulating gas atmosphere of a high purity inert gas constrained within a thermal shield, the laser pulses being applied via a sapphire or other laser permeable window1 has been found to be effective in a trimming process for devices1 the devices being supported and transported on a band of Kaptonn film. A diagram of this process is given in Fig. 7 of the accompanying drawings which shows glass ceramic chips 71 moving in the direction of the arrow on a transport film 72 in a tube provided with a clean gas flow 73. The tube is provided with a polysulphone thermal shield 74 provided with a sapphire window 75 through which the glass chips 71 can be irradiated by a pulsed YAG laser 76. Downstream of the window 75 is provided a waste gas duct 77. The large arrow indicates removal of chips 71 from a probe assay 78 to a data logging system 79. Probing of device resistance may be carried out prior to total cooling of the structure since the curve characteristic may be pre programmed into a read only memory feeding a data logging system recording device resistance temperature. It is only possible to trim to a higher value of resistance by this means. It is also possible to combine two devices1 such devices being constructed upon a single substrate chip and having different electrode patterning, to enable curve matching to attain a high degree of accuracy. The thermal sensor chips may be sensitive to atmospheric moisture or to environmental contamination and generally are encapsulated or packaged prior to use. In the case of chips requiring a good low energy infra red response, the devices can be coated, for example, with an infra red transmissive polymeric coating1 for example, by dip coating from a solution of polytrifluorochloroethylene in acetone solution, followed by baking in an oven at 3000C. for a few minutes. Alternatively, the chips may, after lead attachment, be thermally encapsulated within a polymeric material, such as polymethylpentene. Where the device is to be used to measure or monitor temperature, epoxy, polysiloxane, glass or metal packages or a combination of these may be used to package the thermal sensor. Becauise of the ease of metallisation of the glass ceramic, back metallised devices may be bonded to package, header or the like, either by soldering, preferably with a low melting point solder, or by utilising a metal loaded polymeric adhesive, such as a silver epoxy combination. In the case of differential or multiple devices a tracking between the devices may be improved by bonding the glass ceramic chip to a thermal sink of small dimension, for example, a disc of beryllium oxide attached to the base of a TO39 header. An illustration of this type of construction is given in Fig. 8 of the accompanying drawings, which shows a sensor chip 81, a heat sink BeO 82, mounting media 83, a header 84, for example of polysulphone, and lead outs 85. One of the great advantages of the present invention is the ease with which reproducible, high impedance devices may be produced. Thus, by way of example, a sensor with a resistance of about 27 M ohm at 200C. and a weight of 2.4 mg., with an active surface area of 0.5 mm. x 0.5 mm., would have a responsivity of about 500 K ohm per 0C. over the temperature range of 18 to 25OC The present invention described above provides a strongly negative temperature coefficient device capable of exceeding industry standards when compared to thermistor type devices. Heated devices may also be constructed by evaporatively coating the rear surface of the glass ceramic element with a resistive material, such as nichrome, or by screening a resistive ink upon the surface. Thus, physically small, indirectly heated devices suitable for liquid level control, air flow measurements and the like may be easily produced. Schematic diagrams of indirectly heated thermal sensors are given in Figs. 9 and 10 of the accompanying drawings. In Fig. 9, an insulating glass ceramic 91 is provided with a first conductive material 92 and a second conductive material 93 and metallisation 94, with connected sensors 95 in parallel. In Fig. 10, 101 indicates the face of the device with semiconducting glass ceramic, gold metallisation 102 and nichrome metallisation or semiconductive glass ceramic pattern 103, serving as a heating element. These forms of construction lend themselves to dip encapsulation, for example in a temperatureresistant epoxy compound, to give a physically small, packaged unit. For amplitude, gain control or RMS power measurement, the device or devices may be mounted in an evacuated glass or metal housing. The device can also be mounted in an evacuated chamber to protect the device from incidental heat arising from air currents, the chamber being provided with an infra red permeable window, for example of silicon or germanium. Obviously, many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible within the scope of the above teachings. The following are given as fields in which the present invention is potentially useful and advantageous. The glass ceramic thermal sensor may be used 1. For temperature measurement and control, for example in disposable thermometers when coupled to a reading instrument, industrial control, domestic thermostat or the like. 2. For flame detection, for example in boiler controls, gas ignition systems and the like.3. For explosion detection, for example for monitoring chemical plant, gaseous atmospheres and the like.4. For heat emission detection, for example counting hot objects, monitoring furnace doors or the like.5. In domestic appliances, for example thermostats in electric irons, cookers, heaters and the like.6. In thermal touch switches, for example domestic lighting control, access control and the like.7. For industrial protection of transformers, assemblies, PCB s and the like.8. For automotive sensors, for example engine temper ature and environment monitoring.9. For liquid level sensing, for example in tanks and chemical process systems.10. Air and windspeed transducers, for example air flow meters and draught measurement.11. In fire suppression systems. for example aircraft fuel tank or marine engine monitoring. 12. In medical telemetry apparatus, for example measuring thermal parameters by endoradiosonde techniques.13. In alarm systems. for example thermally operated intruder alarms.14. As safety devices a for example thermal cutouts in domestic colour T.V. apparatus.15. For fire detection, for example rate of rise heat detectors. 16. For hot spot detection, for example in probing high current electrical installations.17. For gas chromatography, for example in gas flow detectors relying upon specific heat changes. The following Examples are given for the purpose of illustrating the present invention Example 1. Exolosion flame detection. A glass ceramic composition similar to composition A was produced in the form of discs as described above. A small percentage of silver oxide was incorporated into the substrate glass 7.1 by weight Ag20 to increase the specific conductivity at low temperatures. Single devices were then formed from the discs by the processing stages described above.Referring now to Fig. 11 of the accompanying drawings, two devices were mounted in a glass tube having a thin 0.02 mm. silicon window 2 , one device 3 being mounted about 2 mm. from the window and facing the window, the other device 4 being mounted behind the first device and in the shadow of the device. A 3 mm.thick polysulphone thermal shield 5 was placed around the axis of the tube. After termination 6 and filling with dry nitrogen 7 , the mounted devices were connected to electronic amplifying circuitry comprising a high gain Av 2000 instrumentation differential amplifier 8 and associated components feeding a voltage level detection circuit 9 . An audible warning device 10 was connected to the level detector via a suitable impedance matching buffer 11 . After applying power to the circuit and setting the balance control 12 so that the audible warning device just ceased operation, the assembly was tested as follows A 1 litre sample of nitric oxide saturated with carbon disulphide vapour and contained in a polymethyl pentene cylinder 7 was placed 7 metres from the device assembly and facing the silicon window area.This mixture of gases was ignited by means of a taper, the heat emission from the rapidly burning gases triggered the voltage detection via thermal sensor circuitry and actuated the audible warning device.Thus, the glass ceramic thermal sensor may be utilised as an efficient explosion detector. A similar test using a 5 litre sample of propane gas burning in air at a distance of 10 metres also triggered an alarm condition. A device utilised in such a manner would be useful for surveillance of chemical storage tanks. activation of fire explosion suppression systems, observation of mine workings, monitoring aircraft fuel tanks or domestic appliances, such as heaters, cookers, open fires and the like.Example 2.Intruder detection. A similar arrangement of two devices as described in Example 1 was set up. Referring to Figs.12 and 13 of the accompanying drawings, the combined devices 1 mounted in a glass tube were placed at the focal point of a 50 mm. diameter concave mirror 2 f 65 mm. which was gold metallised upon the concave surface. The detector assembly 3 was used to monitor a doorway 4 from a distance of 5 metres, the detection circuitry being as described inExample 1, a changeover relay 5 replacing the audible warning device. A person walking through the door at an average pace triggered an alarm condition, the relay being actuated. Similary, an array of five devices 13 mounted at the focal point of a semi cylindrical lens 2 made from an infra red transmissive polymer, was capable of analysing the movement of a thermal object 3 moving past the sensor array. An array of devices may thus be used to sense not only the presence but also the direction and speed of a passing thermal object.Example 3.Disposable thermometer element. Referring to Fig. 14 of the accompanying drawings, a single element glass ceramic thermal sensor 1 was mounted upon a polyethylene coated Mylar polyethylene terephthalate substrate 2 measuring approximately 1 cm. x 15 cms. The polymeric film had previously been subjected to a screen printing process to develop two metallised conductors formed from a silver epoxy compound upon its surface 3 . A high viscosity cyanoacrylate type adhesive was used to fix the device to the polymeric foil. A single drop of a liquid, twocomponent, heat curing silicon rubber compound 4 was applied over the mounted sensor. A further piece of polyethylene coated Mylar film 5 was laminated to the first one using a sintered low density polyethylene powder as a preformed spacer 6 . The exposed leads on the polymeric film were terminated with a two pin plug 8 . The completed sensor assemblage was connected to a previously calibrated reading instrument 7 which comprised a bridge measuring circuit, analogueto digital converter and a digital display system. The sensor as mounted and described above is useful for monitoring oral temperatures and is of sufficient low cost to enable disposal after use. Similarly, a sensor mounted as above was provided with a selfadhesive film which enabled surface temperatures to be measured accurately, for example on incubators.example 4.Thermal touch switch. Referring to Fig. 15 of the accompanying drawings, a sensor 1 formed from glass Composition B was mounted behind a drilled cavity 2 in a switch plate 3 . The chip was again mounted using a twocomponent, liquid, heat curing silicone rubber compound 4 . Prior to mounting. an embossed polycarbonate film 5 was applied as a legendable surface to the front surface of the switch plate. The output leads from the sensor were directed to a high gain bridge amplifier circuit 6 feeding a schmitt trigger and bistable circuit 7 . The output from the bistable circuit was used to trigger a triac 8 controlling domestic lighting. The circuitry was constructed as a thick film hybrid integrated circuit 9 of small dimensions, mounted behind the switch plate. It is considered unnecessary to detail the exact circuitry since, to those skilled in the art of electronic design, development of alternative circuitry will present no difficulty. A finger applied to the switch sensor enables the triac controlled lighting circuit to operate after a thermal delay of d 50 milliseconds. Touching the switch sensor again turned off the lighting circuit. Thus, the glass ceramic thermal sensor can be used as a component in an efficient on off thermal touch switch.
