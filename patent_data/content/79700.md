# CUTTING TOOLS

## Abstract
A shank, or a part attached to the shank, of a rotary cutting tool 28 has a formation 29 for use in holding the tool within a chuck 10. The length of the formation 29 in the direction of the rotary axis of the tool 28 is small in relation to the width of the formation 20, and the tool has an alignment face 32 accurately positioned in relation to the rotary axis of the tool 28. The formation 29 is operable to urge the alignment face 32 against a complimentary alignment face of the chuck 10 to make the rotary axis of the tool 28 as parallel as possible to the rotary axis of the chuck 10. The relatively short length of the formation 29 in relation to the width of the formation reduces any turning moment about a radial axis caused by misalignment or malformation of the formation and hence increases the extent to which engagement of the alignment faces controls the parallelism of the rotary axes of the tool 28 and the chuck 10. The coupling principle which results in alignment of the axes may also be applicable to the coupling together of other items.
