## Description
This invention relates to a process for producing specific proteins in bacteria and having them excreted from the bacterial cell and pertains more specifically to inserting the DNA representing the desired non bacterial protein or part of a protein by recombinant techniques into the plasmid or phage gene for either a periplasmic or an extracellular protein, hereinafter called a carried protein , transforming a bacterial host with the recombined gene, and culturing the transformed host to excrete the protein. The protein thus produced can be collected by conventional procedures from the culture medium or from the periplasmic space depending upon the choice of carrier protein gene. It is known to insert DNA representing a specific protein into the gene for an intracellular protein. Itakura et al, The foregoing problem is avoided in accordance with our invention by providing a method of making a selected protein or portion thereof by inserting DNA representing the selected protein or portion thereof into a bacterial gene, characterized by cleaving the bacterial gene for an extracellular or periplasmic carrier protein, inserting into the cleavage site by a recombinant step a non bacterial DNA fragment which codes for the selected protein or portion thereof, transforming a bacterial host with the recombined gene, and culturing the transformed bacteria to excrete the selected protein or portion thereof. By way of example, by employing a gene for a carrier protein which has a leader sequence of hydrophobic amino acids at its amino terminus and which is normally excreted through the membrane of the cell within which it is made, with cleavage of the hydrophobic leader sequence during excretion, a selected protein can be produced which can be recovered either from the periplasmic space or from the medium in which the bacterium is grown, depending upon the choice of carrier protein. In this way contamination from the other proteins within the bacterium is avoided while achieving greater stability by avoiding the enzymes within the bacterial cell which degrade foreign proteins. Among the bacterial genes for carrier proteins which genes can therefore be employed in the present invention are the genes for antibiotic resistance, such as the gene for penicillin resistance or possibly penicillinase, the gene for chloramphenicol resistance, or the gene for tetracycline resistance, as well as the gene for alkaline phosphatase and the gene for bacterial ribonuclease. Genes or DNA fragments which code for a variety of proteins or portions thereof can be inserted in the bacterial carrier protein gene by the process of the present invention. These proteins include a variety of non bacterial proteins such as eukaryotic cell proteins and viral proteins. Of particular importance are eukaryotic cell proteins such as insulin, human growth hormone, interferon and other pharmacologically active proteins. These are synthesized by their respective genes as pre proteins or precursor proteins having at their amino terminus a series of hydrophobic amino acids. This hydrophobic leader sequence is not identical to that for the bacterial proteins which are excreted through the bacterial membrane. Therefore, the fact that pre insulin or other pre proteins of higher cells contain a hydrophobic leader sequence is in itself no basis for expecting that such a pre protein could be matured in the bacterial cell even if it could be synthesized within the cell. Moreover, the process of the present invention, in addition to providing for the synthesis within and excretion from bacterial cells of matured proteins of eukaryotic cells, which are of known utility, also makes possible the synthesis in and excretion from bacterial cells of other extracellular products of commercial interest. These include other fused proteins and fused proteins consisting of carrier proteins, as defined above, which carry specific determinants, for example, viral antigens such as coat proteins or other antigenic proteins of viruses. These latter fused proteins are useful in the manufacture of vaccines, being capable because of their antigenic character of inducing generation of an immune response specific to the viruses. Such vaccines will be unusually safe because they will not contain any live or inactivated virus material. Furthermore, it is possible by this process to construct vaccines for viruses which cannot be grown in culture. Figs. 1, 2 and 3 of the drawing show the complete base sequence for the E. The following specific example is intended to illustrate more fully the nature of the present invention without acting as a limitation upon its scope. There was employed as the carrier protein The plasmid carries a Pst providencia stuartii endonuclease restriction site of the penicillinase gene corresponding to the position of amino acids 181 and 182, as shown in the drawing. Double stranded cDNA was synthesized from RNA containing preproinsulin mRNA PPI mRNA isolated from an X ray induced, transplantable rat B cell tumor Chick The double stranded cDNA was inserted into the Pst site of plasmid pBR322 by the following procedure pBR322 DNA 5.0 µg was linearized with Pst and approximately 15 dG residues were added per 3 end by terminal transferase at 15 C in the presence of 1 mM Co² Roychoudhury Transformation of One colony was identified by the HART Screening. The Pst excisable insert was sequenced by the method of Maxam and Gilbert P.N.A.S., These 48 clones of transformed Each 8.25 cm diameter disk of clear polyvinyl PV 8 mm thick Dora May Co., New York was flattened between sheets of smooth paper. In a glass petri disk, each disk was then placed upon the surface of a liquid containing 10 ml of 0.2 MNaHCO₃, at pH 9.2, containing 60 µg ml IgG. After 2 minutes or longer at room temperature, the disk was removed and washed twice with 10 ml of cold wash buffer WB which consisted of phosphate buffered saline, 0.5 normal guinea pig serum, 0.1 bovine serum albumin and 0.3 mg ml streptomycin sulfate. Each disk was used immediately after washing. Antigens were released from bacterial cells by transferring colonies onto 1.5 agarose containing 0.5 mg lysozyme ml, 30 mM Tris pH 8, and 10 mM EDTA. The IgG coated surface of a PV disk was placed face down on the agarose and bacterial colonies and left for 60 minutes at 4 . Each disk was then removed and washed 3 times with 10 ml of cold WB. This step completed the immunoadsorption of antigen onto the solid phase antibody layer. Reaction of the ¹²⁵I labeled antibodies with the antigen now adhering to the disks was done by setting 1.5 ml WB containing 5 x 10⁶ cpm γ emission ¹²⁵I IgG onto the center of an 8.25 cm diameter flat disk of ordinary nylon mesh which had been placed in the bottom of a petri dish. The mesh served as a spacer. A disk treated as in the earlier steps then was placed facedown on the mesh and solution and incubated overnight at 4 . Each disk was then washed twice with 10 ml cold WB and twice with water, and allowed to dry at room temperature. At this point, fused proteins had bound to both the ordinary and radioactively labeled layers of IgG. These proteins were then detected with conventional autoradiography technique using Kodak No. Screen Film or Kodak X OMAT R film and a DuPont Cronex Lighting plus intensifying screen as described for example by Laskey The IgG fractions were prepared from each immune serum by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by DEAE cellulose Whatman, DE 52 chromatography in 0.025 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.3, 1 glycerol. Fractions containing the bulk of the flow through material were pooled, and protein was precipitated by adding ammonium sulfate to 40 saturation. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 1 3 the original serum volume of 0.025 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.3, 0.1 M NaCl, 1 glycerol, and dialized against the same buffer. After dialysis, any residual precipitate was removed by centrifugation. IgG fractions were stored in aliquots at 70 . Each IgG fraction was radioiodinated by the usual method of Hunter This screening detected one clone of It will be appreciated that the DNA sequence for the desired eukaryotic cell protein can be inserted into a Hind II cut corresponding to the position between amino acids 101 and 102 of the protein for which this pBR322 plasmid codes, or into the Taq cut at the position corresponding to amino acid 45. In all cases, if the eukaryotic cell DNA is arranged in phase, by the random addition of tails or by other procedures, it will be expressed as a fused part of the carrier protein and the protein excreted from the cell. Furthermore, the sequence of the penicillinase gene, as it exists in this plasmid, or in others, can be modified either by mutation, or by direct recombinant DNA techniques such as the insertion of DNA fragments at specific points within the gene, in such way as to insert new restriction cuts that are convenient for splicing. For example, the R1 cut on the plasmid pBR322 can be removed by mutation, and an R1 sequence inserted by ligation into the penicillinase gene. Although this might inactivate the gene, it would not interfere with the use of this region of DNA to synthesize a carrier protein. The segment of the penicillinase gene DNA between the code for amino acid 23 at the end of the hydrophobic leader and the code for amino acid 45 at the Taq cut for example, can be removed by nibbling back the DNA by a mixture of appropriate enzymes. One such mixture is the lambda exonuclease which will chew back the DNA strand from the 5 end, together with the enzyme S1, which will remove the single stranded overhand. Another such mixture is T₄ DNA polymerase which will chew back the 3 end of one DNA strand together with S1, which again will remove the single stranded overhang. By controlled digestion the plasmid DNA molecule can be appropriately shortened to the fragment extending from the R1 cut to the point coding for amino acid 23 or to other points on the hydrophobic leader sequence, and such a fragment can be fused to a similarly generated fragment containing the insulin sequence, chewed back enzymatically to a convenient initial point, presumably again, the point where the mature insulin molecule begins. These two fragments can be fused together, for example,, by butt end ligation by the T₄ DNA ligase, and that fusion inserted into the plasmid. That fusion produces a degenerate species of the carrier protein, for which the carrier gene codes for only the The procedure of the present invention is not restricted to the use of the Difco , Millipore , Sephadex and Whatman are Registered Trade Marks.
