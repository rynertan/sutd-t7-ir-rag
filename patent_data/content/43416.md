# Storage addressing control apparatus.

## Abstract
Storage addressing control apparatus is structured to provide either byte or word addressing of storage organized on a two byte word basis. The storage address register 6 is made shiftable whereby for byte operations it is shifted, and the bit SAR BIT 16 shifted out of the register is used for byte selection. The contents of the storage address register are used to address storage 10 for both word and byte addressing, and no change is required. The storage access, however, for byte addressing takes place after the shift is completed and the timing is adjusted to account for the shift operation. Gate control logic is modified to facilitate the byte selection.
